40|$|Amphibian {{populations are}} declining {{worldwide}} {{due to a}} number of stressors including pesticides and parasites. Conservation of these animals can be complicated because populations can differ dramatically in response to the same stressor. When consistently exposed to pesticides, some populations evolve tolerance through the process of natural selection acting across multiple generations. Alternatively, populations that are intermittently exposed to pesticides induce tolerance within a single generation. To date, however, there have been few studies examining the costs associated with these different stress tolerance mechanisms. In this study, we examined how difference in stress tolerance influence susceptibility to parasitic infections. We collected wood frog tadpoles from four different populations: two with evolved tolerance to pesticides and two with the ability to induce <b>pesticide</b> <b>tolerance.</b> We exposed tadpoles from each population to sublethal doses of carbaryl (0 and 5 ppm) for 5 days. Tadpoles were allowed to acclimate in pesticide-free water for 2 days. After this acclimation period, we then exposed tadpoles to 0 or 50 trematode parasites (Echinostoma trivolvis) for 2 days and counted the number of parasites encysted within the body.

40|$|Disturbances play {{important}} roles in shaping ecological and evolutionary processes. By using disturbances to perturb natural systems, biologist can both develop generalizable predictions about how disturbances alter natural systems as well as utilize disturbances {{as a tool to}} test ecological and evolutionary theory. Using pesticide disturbances in aquatic systems, {{the first half of this}} thesis integrates ecology, evolution, and toxicology to develop predictions about the consequences of pesticides in aquatic communities and patterns of <b>pesticide</b> <b>tolerance</b> across populations of wood frogs (Lithobathes sylvaticus). Towards this goal, I first conducted a mesocosm study tracking the direct and indirect effects of four insecticides–applied individually and as a mixture– across 18 weeks and demonstrated that insecticides applied individually and in a mixture have complex direct and indirect consequences on aquatic system response and recovery not predicted by traditional laboratory tests. Second, I investigated the potential for cross-tolerance in non-target populations of wood frogs and demonstrate that amphibian populations with tolerance to one pesticide may be cross-tolerant to many other pesticides. The second half of this dissertation uses pesticides as a tool, to test theoretical predictions about the role of phenotypic plasticity in evolutionary innovation to novel environments. I investigated whether natural populations of wood frogs can respond plastically to pesticides (i. e. by inducing increased tolerance) and whether there is evidence supporting the process of genetic assimilation. This study is the first to demonstrate that sublethal and ecologically relevant concentrations of a common insecticide can, within the same generation, induce adaptive tolerance in amphibians and the population-level patterns of inducibility are consistent with predictions of genetic assimilation. Induced <b>pesticide</b> <b>tolerance</b> would be particularly beneficial to non-target species if it were to confer increased tolerance not only against the pesticide it first experienced, but also against many other pesticides (e. g., induced cross-tolerance). Using wood frogs, the final chapter of this dissertation demonstrated the phenomenon of induced cross-tolerance and suggests that cross-tolerance is not limited to insecticides that share mode of action. Overall, the inducible tolerance and cross-tolerance findings suggest that phenotypic plasticity may play a role in shaping patterns of species abundance in nature. ...|$|E

40|$|Passage of the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) in {{late summer}} of 1996 was {{supposed}} to be a watershed for consumer protection from exposure to pesticide residues.

Before too long, lawyers representing environmental advocacy groups sued EPA for failing to implement the FQPA as Congress intended. Two watershed events came out of the brewing conflicts. First, agricultural groups and chemical manufacturers demanded more input into the evolving risk assessment policy that the FQPA necessitated. Transparency by the EPA resulted from the lobbying, and all of the public was free to see and comment on new policies required for assessing residential, aggregate, and cumulative exposure to pesticide residues.

40|$|Many {{amphibian}} {{species have}} wide altitudinal and latitudinal distribution ranges, and hence, different {{populations of the}} same species may face very different environmental constraints and selection pressures.

We reviewed the evidence for among population genetic differentiation (past adaptation) and within population genetic variation (potential for future adaptation) in different life history traits in amphibians, focusing mainly in studies conducted with the Common Frog, Rana temporaria, and with the Alpine Newt, Triturus alpestris. Except for larval traits, the evidence for genetic basis of population differentiation, as well as for heritability of different traits, is limited. This is especially true for traits expressed only in adults, such as age of maturity, fecundity and longevity, and traits relating to tolerance to different types of environmental stresses (e. g. nitrate, UV-B, <b>pesticide</b> <b>tolerances).</b> We suggest that due to the relative ease in which the genetic basis of most traits in amphibians can be studied, they might provide good model systems to study possible consequences of, and adaptation to, environmental changes expected to occur in forthcoming decades...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{increasing}} concern raised over concentrations of nitrates and pesticides in both surface and ground water within the Great Lakes Basin. Increases of concentration may possibly be associated with the migration of these materials from agricultural lands (Agriculture Canada 1992). While a soil nitrogen test for corn has been developed, most producers determine their rates of nitrogen fertilizer based solely on economic factors, expected yield and the price ratio of nitrogen to corn. Successful farming practices, as measured by high economic yields, are also important environmentally. Crops take up nitrogen derived both from mineralization of soil organic matter and fertilizer sources. Nutrients not taken up by the crop remain potentially available to be lost by leaching or volatilization. Our hypothesis is that matching nitrogen application rates more to crop utilization will result in less opportunity for leaching inorganic nitrogen, no matter what its source to ground water. Eventually, this should lead to reduced nitrate concentrations in ground and surface water. Certain weed species have developed triazine <b>pesticide</b> <b>tolerance</b> in Ontario.

Nectar consists of carbohydrates, amino acids and water, {{as well as other}} minor compounds whose proportion varies among plant species and whose biological implications in the honey bee physiology require intense research. Several environmental stressors are causing the decline of bee colonies, and thereby, we tried to connect the nutritional quality of bee’s diet with the strength of the bee’s immune system. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is present in nectar, honey and adult honey bees. It has been demonstrated that ABA stimulates innate immune defences in animal cells. However, the influence of ABA on A. mellifera’s health and fitness is unknown. Here, we show that honey bees fed with an ABA supplement in field experiments resulted in (i) the appearance of ABA in larvae and adult bees, (ii) enhanced haemocyte response to non-self recognition, (iii) improved wound healing and granulocyte and plasmatocyte activation and (iv) maximum adult bee population after the winter and increased <b>pesticide</b> <b>tolerance.</b> The results indicate that the naturally occurring compound ABA has a positive influence in honey bee immunity.

Objective: Our goal was to determine whether urinary concentrations of dialkylphosphate (DAP) metabolites of OP pesticides declined between the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III and NHANES 1999 – 2004. Me t h o d s: Using mass spectrometry–based methods, we analyzed urine samples from a nationally representative sample of 2, 874 adults 20 – 59 years of age in NHANES 1999 – 2004 and samples from a non-nationally representative sample of 197 adult participants for NHANES III (1988 – 1994) for six common DAP metabolites of OP pesticides. Re s u l t s: Median urinary DAP concentrations decreased by more than half between NHANES III and NHANES 2003 – 2004. Reductions of about 50 %– 90 % were also observed for 95 th percentile concentrations of five of the six metabolites. Frequencies of detection (FODs) decreased in all six metabolites (< 50 % reduction).

40|$|Abstract Background The U. S. imports a {{substantial}} and increasing {{portion of its}} fruits and vegetables. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration currently inspects {{less than one percent}} of import shipments. While countries exporting to the U. S. are expected to comply with U. S. <b>tolerances,</b> including allowable <b>pesticide</b> residue levels, there is a low rate of import inspections and few other incentives for compliance. Methods This analysis estimates the quantity of excess pesticide residue that could enter the U. S. if exporters followed originating country requirements but not U. S. <b>pesticide</b> <b>tolerances,</b> for the top 20 imported produce items based on quantities imported and U. S. consumption levels. Pesticide health effects data are also shown. Results The model estimates that for the identified items, 120 439 kg of pesticides in excess of U. S. tolerances could potentially be imported to the U. S., in cases where U. S. regulations are more protective than those of originating countries. This figure is in addition to residues allowed on domestic produce. In the modeling, the top produce item, market, and pesticide of concern were oranges, Chile, and Zeta-Cypermethrin. Pesticides in this review are associated with health effects on 13 body systems, and some are associated with carcinogenic effects. Conclusions There is a critical information gap regarding pesticide residues on produce imported to the U. S. Without a more thorough sampling program, it is not possible accurately to characterize risks introduced by produce importation. The scenario presented herein relies on assumptions, and should be considered illustrative. The analysis highlights the need for additional investigation and resources for monitoring, enforcement, and other interventions, to improve import food safety and reduce pesticide exposures in originating countries. </p...|$|R

It is the most damaging acarine pest of tea crops in the sub-Himalayan Terai region of India which is mostly controlled chemically in the conventionally managed tea plantations of the region. Objectives of the present study were to i) investigate the tolerance level of O. coffeae collected from bio-organically managed plantations (BMP) (with no synthetic acaricide application) and conventionally managed plantations (CMP) (with periodic application of synthetic acaricide) to the acaricides, ’ethion’ and ’fenpropathrin’, ii) Quantify the detoxifying enzymes, general esterases (GE) of phase I and glutathione S-transferases (GST) of phase II, in O. coffeae as these are deemed important in acquiring <b>pesticide</b> <b>tolerance,</b> iii) Establish the relation of GE and GST activity levels with acaricide tolerance levels in populations of O. coffeae. The study revealed that i) BMP populations of O. coffeae were susceptible to both of the acaricides whereas CMP populations were tolerant. CMP populations of the pest showed low to medium tolerance to the organophosphate acaricide ’ethion’ whereas tolerance to the synthetic pyrethroid, ’fenpropathrin’ was high; ii) Corresponding GE and GST levels were significantly higher in CMP populations compared to that of BMP population. Electrophoretic analysis of GE isozymes of CMP and BMP populations further corroborated the quantitative study; iii) activity of the detoxifying enzymes, GE and GST were positively correlated with the tolerance level of O. coffeae populations indicating involvement of these enzymes in the development of acaricide tolerance...|$|E

Novel {{approaches for}} linking contaminant effects with population declinesIt {{is clear that}} many threats such as habitat loss, chemical pollution and global warming are contributing to both local and global amphibian declines. Yet aside from a few examples, we still {{know very little about}} the role and magnitude of synergistic effects among these stressors. Demonstrated in marine ectotherms, thermal tolerance is limited by the incapability of an organism’s circulatory and ventilation systems to supply sufficient oxygen to match with its oxygen demand (i. e. aerobic scope). Beyond certain critical temperatures, survival of aquatic ectotherms becomes passive and time-limited, relying heavily on anaerobic metabolism and molecular protection (e. g., induction of heat shock proteins). Detoxification is known to be an energy-demanding process. It is thus likely that an organism under thermal stress will suffer further decrease in aerobic scope and loss of performance in a contaminated environment, which may in turn threaten their survival. Our study thus focused on the relationships between pollution and thermal stress on three lowland wetland amphibian larvae in South China, namely Asian common toad (Bufonidae: Duttaphrynus melanostictus), brown tree frog (Rhacophoridae: Polypedates megacephalus) and marbled pigmy frog (Microhylidae: Microhyla pulchra), and the relative performance of the invasive fish predator Gambusia affinis as opposed to local larval amphibians. This study determined and compared lethal concentrations of two commonly used agricultural pesticides, glyphosate and methomyl, on the target amphibian and fish species, as well as lethal temperatures of these animals. The investigation on the synergistic effects of thermal stress and pesticides is currently being conducted using integrated measurements of physiological end-points and biomarkers including growth rate, oxygen consumption rate, and expression of heat shock protein and lactate dehydrogenase. Our preliminary results showed that <b>pesticide</b> <b>tolerance</b> varied highly between the three amphibian species, with D. melanostictus being the most tolerant, followed by P. megacephalus and M. pulchra, and that the invasive predator G. affinis had a wider thermal tolerance window (37. 16 oC) than P. megacephalus (33. 97 oC) and M. pulchra (34. 36 oC). Further information generated from this study on the synergy between pollution and thermal stress will aid in developing conservation measures to better protect amphibian populations against these rising threats in South China region. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Breastfeeding has {{numerous}} {{benefits to}} {{mother and child}} including improved maternal post-partum health, maternal/child bonding, and infant neurodevelopment and immune function. However, concern has been expressed about potential health risks posed to infants from environmental chemicals in human milk. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 requires the United States Environmental Protection Agency to set <b>pesticide</b> <b>tolerance</b> levels in food that {{ensure the safety of}} sensitive sub-populations, particularly pregnant women and children. Maternal dietary and environmental exposures to organophosphate (OP), organochlorine (OC), carbamate, and pyrethroid pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may lead to measurable levels of these chemicals in breast milk and because some of these chemicals interfere with hormone regulation, a mother's ability to lactate may be compromised by exposure. Lactational exposures to infants are of particular concern because infants' metabolic, neurologic and other systems are developing leading children to be more susceptible to the hazards of pesticides than adults. Although persistent pesticides, such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), have been biomonitored in human milk for decades, there are few studies measuring non-persistent pesticides in milk and no studies examining potential sources of non-persistent pesticides in milk. Using data and samples from the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS), another study on peripartum pesticide excretion, and a study of breast milk samples collected from San Francisco Bay Area women, this research aimed to: 1) to determine whether persistent organic pollutants measured in the blood of CHAMACOS participants are associated with shortened lactation duration; 2) to measure and compare the chemical concentrations of OPs, OCs, carbamates, pyrethroids, and PCBs in the milk of women residing in an rural area with those of women residing in an urban region; and 3) to investigate whether concentrations of two non-persistent pesticides highly detected in milk are correlated with concentrations measured in other biological samples and determine the potential predictors or sources of maternal exposure. Maternal concentrations of potentially endocrine disrupting chemicals measured in maternal serum were not associated with shortened lactation duration. Breast milk samples from urban and agricultural populations contained all of the persistent chemicals measured and the non-persistent pesticides, chlorpyrifos and permethrin. Concentrations of these two non-persistent pesticides were positively, but not statistically significantly correlated with concentrations measured in the plasma and urine of the same women. Lastly, some dietary and household factors may be potential sources of exposure to the mothers studied. The proposed research will provide information on maternal exposure and lactational exposure of non-persistent and persistent pesticides and PCBs to our most sensitive population, infants. Understanding whether lactation is potentially disrupted and the extent of dietary exposures to infants will allow for informed policy decisions regarding the use of pesticides and for the design of effective interventions in order {{to ensure the safety of}} this food for infants...|$|E
40|$|Potentiation and {{additive}} {{effects of}} pesticides are considered major {{problems in the}} determination of safe daily intakes of these chemicals. Examples of potentiation between two organophosphates, such as ethyl-p-nitrophenyl benzenethionophosphonate (EPN) and malathion, delnav and malathion, and guthion and dipterex are considered. Although this type of potentiation could give rise to acute accidents, the most important point in evaluation centres on the possible effects of small amounts of potentiating compounds in the daily diet. Likewise, certain drugs of the phenothiazine type potentiate the toxic effects of organophosphates. A review of the data for both types of potentiation indicates that the consumption of raw agricultural products containing <b>pesticides</b> at <b>tolerance</b> levels constitutes a minimal hazard. A two-year rat-feeding investigation {{using a combination of}} eight flavouring agents and six pesticides, at use levels and higher, did not cause a significant alteration of toxicity in comparison with the toxicity of the individual substances...|$|R
40|$|Growing {{consumer}} demand for {{knowledge in the}} area of food safety and producer accountability on what is applied to fresh produce is resulting in a greater need for transparency in the industry. Additionally, the demand for safe, fresh produce year round has led to extensive international trade and consumers to wonder if imported produce is of the same quality of that in produced in the U. S. The study analyzes the differences and similarities between <b>pesticide</b> application <b>tolerance</b> standards, and labels for applied use on berries produced in the U. S., Mexico, and Chile. This is done by reviewing tolerance information and criteria from governmental agencies that regulate pesticide use levels and individual pesticide labels from each country to determine the comparative level of standards. The results indicate equal regulations for Mexico-produced and exported tolerance levels on berries compared with U. S. numbers in and even longer wait periods following pesticide application before harvest. Meanwhile, Chilean pesticide regulations showed even higher standards on pesticide residue levels for berries, but still shorter harvest wait periods compared with the U. S. The study provides an interesting looking into international standards for fresh berries and how the industry is evolving to meet {{consumer demand}} for quality assurance and safety...|$|R
40|$|The Child-Specific Aggregate Cumulative Human Exposure and Dose (CACHED) {{framework}} integrates micro-level activity {{time series}} with mechanistic exposure equations, environmental concentration distributions, and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic components to estimate exposure for multiple routes and chemicals. CACHED was utilized to quantify cumulative and aggregate exposure and dose estimates for {{a population of}} young farmworker children and to evaluate the model for chlorpyrifos and diazinon. Micro-activities of farmworker children collected concurrently with residential measurements of pesticides {{were used in the}} CACHED framework to simulate 115, 000 exposure scenarios and quantify cumulative and aggregate exposure and dose estimates. Modeled metabolite urine concentrations were not statistically different than concentrations measured in the urine of children, indicating that CACHED can provide realistic biomarker estimates. Analysis of the relative contribution of exposure route and pesticide indicates that in general, chlorpyrifos non-dietary ingestion exposure accounts for the largest dose, confirming the importance of the micro-activity approach. The risk metrics computed from the 115, 000 simulations, indicate that greater than 95 % of these scenarios might pose a risk to children’s health from aggregate chlorpyrifos exposure. The variability observed in the route and pesticide contributions to urine biomarker levels demonstrate the importance of accounting for aggregate and cumulative exposure in establishing <b>pesticide</b> residue <b>tolerances</b> in food...|$|R
