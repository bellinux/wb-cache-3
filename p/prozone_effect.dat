50|$|Agglutination tests, {{specific}} {{to a variety}} of pathogens, can be designed and manufactured for clinicians by coating microbeads of latex with pathogen-specific antigens or antibodies. In performing a test, laboratory clinicians will mix a patient's cerebrospinal fluid, serum or urine with the coated latex particles in serial dilutions with normal saline (important to avoid the <b>prozone</b> <b>effect)</b> and observe for agglutination (clumping). Agglutination of the beads in any of the dilutions is considered a positive result, confirming either (1) that the patient's body has produced the pathogen-specific antibody (if the test supplied the antigen) or (2) that the specimen contains the pathogen's antigen (if the test supplied the antibody). Instances of cross-reactivity (where the antibody sticks to another antigen besides the antigen of interest) can lead to confusing results.|$|E

For this specific purpose, the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity test proved to be of limited sensitivity because only relatively high serum dilutions can be tested dependably, due to <b>prozone</b> <b>effects</b> at low serum concentrations, and because antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity reactions at the 5 % level are not always statistically significant. Under the conditions of the test, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-reactive antibodies were not measurable, or only barely measurable, in early-acute-phase sera, but they became detectable during convalescence and increased thereafter, gradually over many months to the range of titers seen in healthy persons after long-past-primary Epstein-Barr virus infections. The percentages of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ultimately attained were on the order of 20 % in most patients and healthy individuals, but in others did not exceed 10 %.

40|$|Abstract Background Rapid {{diagnosis}} of Plasmodium falciparum infections {{is important because}} of the potentially fatal complications. SDFK 90 is a recently marketed malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) targeting both histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP 2) and P. falciparum -specific Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (Pf-pLDH). The present study evaluated its diagnostic accuracy. Methods SDFK 90 was tested against a panel of stored whole blood samples (n= 591) obtained from international travellers suspected of malaria, including the four human Plasmodium species and Plasmodium negative samples. Microscopy {{was used as a}} reference method, corrected by PCR for species diagnosis. In addition, SDFK 90 was challenged against 59 P. falciparum samples with parasite density ≥ 4 % to assess the <b>prozone</b> <b>effect</b> (no or weak visible line on initial testing and a higher intensity upon 10 -fold dilution). Results Overall sensitivity for the detection of P. falciparum was 98. 5 % and reached 99. 3 % at parasite densities > 100 /μl. There were significantly more PfHRP 2 lines visible compared to Pf-pLDH (97. 3 % vs 86. 9 %), which was mainly absent at parasite densities p = 1. 00) and test results were reproducible. A <b>prozone</b> <b>effect</b> was seen for the PfHRP 2 line in 14 / 59 (23. 7 %) P. falciparum samples tested, but not for the Pf-pLDH line. Few minor shortcomings were observed in the kit’s packaging and information insert. Conclusions SDFK 90 performed excellent for P. falciparum diagnosis. The combination of PfHRP 2 and Pf-pLDH ensures a low detection threshold and counters potential problems of PfHRP 2 detection such as gene deletions and the <b>prozone</b> <b>effect.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|A recent {{international}} workshop documented marked interlaboratory {{variation in}} end point titers of standard islet cell antibody (ICA) positive sera. End titers were lower using a modified assay which utilizes fluorescein labeled protein A (ICA-pA) rather than fluoresceinated anti-IgG (ICA-IgG) to detect antibody binding to islets. In {{this study we}} sought to compare directly two ICA assays with respect to future development of IDDM. Sera were obtained from 26 prospectively evaluated high risk subjects identified by family screening or history of transient hyperglycemia and 12 normal controls. As expected, end point titers for ICA positive sera were 10 times greater using the ICA-IgG assay than with the ICA-pA assay. However, despite higher end point titers, the ICA-IgG assay failed to detect more 'prediabetics' and showed a <b>prozone</b> <b>effect.</b> Fourteen subjects were positive at a 1 : 2 dilution using the ICA-pA assay. Only 10 of these 14 were positive at a 1 : 2 dilution using the ICA-IgG assay but all became positive at greater sera dilutions. No normal controls were positive using either assay. A similar prozone was observed with anti-islet monoclonal antibodies A 2 B 5 and 4 F 2. Sera from 14 long-standing IDDM patients (where titers of ICA may have decreased relative to time of onset of diabetes) which were negative using ICA-pA were also assayed using ICA-IgG. Five sera positive for ICA-IgG but negative for ICA-pA were identified. In addition two sera in which a <b>prozone</b> <b>effect</b> was seen with ICA-pA were identified.

We tested this hypothesis through a combination of theory, proof-of-principle experiments with oligonucleotide annealing, and experiments on the interaction of Xenopus cyclin B 1 -Cdk 1 -Cks 2 with Wee 1 A in vitro and in Xenopus extracts.

40|$|Hybrid bispecific {{monoclonal}} antibodies reacting with carcinoembryonal antigen (CEA) {{and with}} the E. coli enzyme beta-galactosidase (GZ) were produced by fusion of hybridomas or chemical linkage of half-antibodies. Since the original anti-GZ antibody used in these experiments was capable of protecting GZ from thermal denaturation, it was possible, by hybridizing it with two different non-competitive anti-CEA antibodies, to design a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay for quantitation of CEA. In fact, a mathematical analysis of the reaction indicates that, under appropriate concentrations of the reactants, circular complexes can be formed which contain the two hybrid antibodies, the GZ enzyme and the CEA antigen. The stability of these complexes {{can be expected to}} be substantially greater than that of the more labile CEA-free GZ-antibody complexes, prompting {{a significant increase in the}} amount of enzyme molecules which are bound to antibody and are consequently protected from thermal denaturation. These expectations were supported by experimental results: under appropriate conditions, heat-resistant enzyme activity was indeed proportional to concentration of CEA in the range up to 75 ng/ml.

The accuracy of RDTs for the diagnosis of uncomplicated P. falciparum infection is equal or superior to routine microscopy (but inferior to expert microscopy). Sensitivity for Plasmodium vivax is 75 – 100 %; for Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae, diagnostic performance is poor. Design limitations of RDTs include poor sensitivity at low parasite densities, susceptibility to the <b>prozone</b> <b>effect</b> (PfHRP 2 -detecting RDTs), false-negative results due to PfHRP 2 deficiency in the case of pfhrp 2 gene deletions (PfHRP 2 -detecting RDTs), cross-reactions between Plasmodium antigens and detection antibodies, false-positive results by other infections and susceptibility to heat and humidity. End-user’s errors relate to safety, procedure (delayed reading, incorrect sample and buffer volumes) and interpretation (not recognizing invalid test results, disregarding faint test lines). Withholding antimalarial treatment in the case of negative RDT results tends to be infrequent and tendencies towards over-prescription of antibiotics have been noted. Numerous shortcomings in RDT kits’ labelling, instructions for use (correctness and readability) and contents have been observed. The World Health Organization and partners actively address quality assurance of RDTs by comparative testing of RDTs, inspections of manufacturing sites, lot testing and training tools but no formal external quality assessment programme of end-user performance exists. Elimination of malaria requires RDTs with lower detection limits, for which nucleic acid amplification tests are under development...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{examine the}} {{analytical}} aspects of fecal transferrin (Tf) and hemoglobin (Hb) measured on the NS-Prime analyzer {{for use in}} a colon cancer screening program. Designs and methodsMethod evaluation and temperature stability studies for fecal Tf and Hb were completed. A method comparison was carried out against the NS-Plus system using samples collected from 254 screening program participants. A further 200 samples were analyzed to help determine suitable reference limits for fecal Tf using these systems. ResultsThe assay for fecal Tf showed acceptable linearity, precision, and recovery, and showed minimal carryover with low potential for impact by the <b>prozone</b> <b>effect.</b> The 95 th percentile for fecal Tf obtained for the reference population was 4. 9 µg/g feces. The collection device sufficiently maintained fecal Tf and Hb stability for at least 7 days at room temperature, 4 °C, and − 20 °C. Fecal Tf and Hb were most stable at 4 °C and − 20 °C, but showed considerable loss (20 – 40 %) of both proteins at 37 °C within the first 7 days. Mixing small amounts of blood into diluted fecal samples maintained at 37 °C for various time periods showed > 50 % loss of both proteins within 1 h of incubation. ConclusionsThe NS-Prime analyzer showed acceptable performance for fecal Tf and Hb. These studies suggest that use of both Tf and Hb together as biomarkers will result in higher positivity rates, but this may not be attributed to greater stability of Tf over Hb in human feces...|$|E

40|$|Malaria is {{a serious}} {{condition}} in the non-immune traveller, and prognosis depends on timely diagnosis. Although microscopy remains the cornerstone of diagnosis, malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are increasingly used in non-endemic settings. They are easy to use, provide results rapidly and require no specific training and equipment. Reported sensitivities vary between different RDT products but are generally good for Plasmodium falciparum, with RDTs detecting the P. falciparum antigen histidine-rich protein- 2 (PfHRP 2) scoring slightly better than P. falciparum-lactate dehydrogenase (Pf-pLDH) -detecting RDTs. Sensitivity is lower for Plasmodium vivax (66. 0 - 88. 0 %) and poor for Plasmodium ovale (5. 5 - 86. 7 %) and Plasmodium malariae (21. 4 - 45. 2 %). Rapid diagnostic tests have several other limitations, including persistence of the PfHRP 2 antigen, cross-reactions of P. falciparum with the non-falciparum test line and vice versa and (rare) false-positive reactions due to other infectious agents or immunological factors. False-negative results occur {{in the case of}} low parasite densities, <b>prozone</b> <b>effect</b> or pfhrp 2 gene deletions. In addition, errors in interpretation occur, partly due to inadequacies in the instructions for use. Finally, RDTs do not give information about parasite density. In the diagnostic laboratory, RDTs are a valuable adjunct to (but not a replacement for) microscopy for the diagnosis of malaria in the returned traveller. In malaria endemic settings, special groups of travellers (those travelling for long periods, expatriates and short-stay frequent travellers) who are remote from qualified medical services may benefit from self-diagnosis by RDTs, provided they use correctly stored RDT products of proven accuracy, with comprehensive instructions for use and appropriate hands-on training. status: publishe...|$|E
