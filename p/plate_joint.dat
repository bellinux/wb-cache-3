The test results indicated that regarding the edgewise bending force, the strongest middle joint was the double dowel joint made of beech wood (1896. 9 N), while the respective joint made of poplar marked quite a low value of bending force (937. 2 N). The strength of wooden corner blocks was proved to be quite powerful, made either of beech wood, poplar wood or the combination of the two wood species (beech: 1881. 8 N, poplar: 1237. 6 N, beech-poplar: 1783. 6 N).

40|$|AbstractPreviously, Battelle has {{investigated}} the behaviour {{of a series}} of related multi-axial weld fatigue situations and developed effective analysis procedures. The first was a flange-to-tube joint under torsional-dominant loading. The second was a multi-axial stress state under uniaxial loading consisting of a tensile-loaded plate with either a fillet welded pipe or angled attachment. For multi-axial fatigue evaluation, an effective equivalent structural stress range (ΔEESS), defined as a combination of the equivalent normal structural stress range and the equivalent in-plane shear structural stress range in a von Mises form, derived from the Battelle structural stress method (BSSM), was formulated and used to clearly illustrate the differences in the behaviour of these two situations. As an extension of these multi-axial fatigue situations, the BSSM for fatigue life evaluation is examined herein for bi-axial loading of welded <b>plate</b> <b>joints</b> that otherwise require special treatment. However, when the BSSM is applied to bi-axially loaded <b>plate</b> <b>joints,</b> the failure location can be predicted correctly, and fatigue life predictions using the master S-N curve approach are very accurate compared with fatigue test results from the literature. This is because the BSSM captures the bi-axial loading effects, including the ratio of the load magnitudes and their phase difference that define the local variations of ΔEESS within the joint and thus define the failure location of the joint. In this investigation, {{it was found that the}} failure locations are influenced by the maximum normal structural stress (normal to weld line) not by the in-plane shear structural stress (parallel to weld line) which becomes negligible. In addition, it was also found that the cycles-to-failure data from the subject joint types were comparable with the master S-N curve for Mode I loading dominant behavior (inverse slope of 3. 125). Therefore, the master S-N curve that was developed for Mode I failures can be equally applicable for fatigue life predictions for these <b>plate</b> <b>joints</b> under bi-axial loading...|$|R

Within this framework, in order to provide the basic tools for the prediction of the main parameters characterizing the monotonic and cyclic behaviour of joints, in the last two decades, many experimental and theoretical studies have been carried out. As a result of this effort, in EC 3 the formulations for predicting stiffness and resistance of common joint typologies have been codified.

Referancing to the {{connection}} characteristic and mechanical behavior {{as well as}} the defects in application of joints on concrete-filled steel tube between columns and beams, a new connection type of steel beam throughout joints model is proposed.

40|$|The {{companion}} paper {{presents the}} principles of a new design-oriented methodology for progressive collapse assessment of multi-storey buildings. The proposed procedure, which can be implemented at various levels of structural idealisation, determines ductility demand and supply in assessing the potential for progressive collapse initiated by instantaneous loss of a vertical support member.

In line with current progressive collapse guidelines for buildings with a relatively simple and repetitive layout, the two principal scenarios investigated include removal of a peripheral column and a corner column.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The growing use of light-frame wood trusses in the {{residential}} and commercial construction has generated the need for general analysis procedures for predicting deformations and ultimate load of truss-plate joints, which are the basis for accurate evaluation of structural performance and design of complete truss assemblies. This dissertation was aimed at developing such a model. The developed model incorporates mechanisms of load transfer from one wood member through the truss plate and into another wood member and predicts the load-deflection trace and ultimate load. It treats plate teeth as beams on elastic foundation and applies Runge-Kutta numerical analysis to solve the governing differential equations. The nonlinear response of the foundation is accounted for by a linear step-by-step procedure. Additional theoretical investigation consisted of using an existing program to perform finite element analysis of <b>plate</b> <b>joints</b> to determine the interaction of plate teeth arranged in columns or in rows. This analysis showed some interaction among teeth in columns and none among teeth in rows. To develop data for model verification, tests were performed on joints made of Douglas-fir lumber and 20 -gauge truss plates with die-punched teeth -for various grain and plate orientations. Foundation moduli of test joints were obtained by embedment testing under compression loads. Comparisons between theoretical and experimental load-deflection traces show acceptable agreement. Ultimate load was accurately predicted for specimens which failed {{as a result of}} tooth withdrawal, but not for either plate failure or wood failure perpendicular-to-grain, neither of which was included in the model.

40|$|The {{symmetry}} index (SI), as one {{of methods}} to evaluate gait pattern in patients with leg-length discrepancy (LLD), helps to estimate the acceptable range of inequality and to determine symmetry in the kinematic and kinetic data before and after a heel lift, although this parameter has a large standard deviation that undermines its accuracy.

40|$|Failure of welded {{gusset plate}} joints in steel guyed masts due to cyclic {{stresses}} {{with a high}} mean value and amplitude {{is one of the}} major causes for their collapse when subjected to wind loading. To prevent the failure of the welded gusset joints, it is essential to assess the dynamic stress field in welded joints under wind loading. In deference to the global static buckling analysis of welded steel structures where the effects of residual stresses are very small and can be ignored, the welding residual stresses play an important role in assessing the cyclic stresses of gusset plate joints of guyed masts under wind loading. Hence, the residual stresses due to welding have to be included in the assessment. For this, the welding residual stress field in welded joints is first simulated using a numerical thermal-structural coupling analysis. The welding residual stresses are then assigned to a multi-scale finite element model as the initial stress field for the dynamic stress analysis of the welded joints, including a relaxation of the welding residual stresses. The results for the welding residual stress field and for the dynamic cyclic stress field are verified by laboratory tests. The peak value of the resulting cyclic stress is found to occur at the tip of the weld seams, and it results to high mean value and amplitude of cyclic stresses at the tips. Hence, the tips of weld seams are likely to be critical locations, where the welded gusset <b>plate</b> <b>joint</b> may fail due to cyclic stress fatigue under wind loading, and leading to the collapse of the guyed mast...|$|E
40|$|Large civil {{infrastructure}} systems {{all over}} the world have {{become an integral part of}} our civilization. The inspection and maintenance of these structures for public safety is a difficult task. The assessment of integrity of such huge structures due to local damages is even more difficult to deal with. The conventional inspections are performed manually, generally by visual examination and sometimes by more advanced techniques like ultrasonic, electromagnetic and fiber optic techniques. These inspections involve human interventions, depend on individual inspector's experience, and are time consuming. Such inspection methods may not be very useful for real time health assessment of a structure in service and as a result are not very helpful in preventing any disastrous situation through early warning. Therefore, it is very important to look for a comprehensive strategy of global integrity monitoring infused with information about local damages in the structure. For local damage assessment the current state of the health monitoring technology lacks a generalized and definitive approach to the identification and localization of damage. In past decades several signal processing tools have been used for solving different health monitoring problems but the commutability of the tools between different problems has been restricted. Fundamental reasons for this shortcoming have never been investigated in detail. In this dissertation an investigation has been carried out employing almost all promising feature extraction tools on a representative problem - a plate with rivet holes. The problem considered has radial cracks around rivet holes in a joint panel of a steel truss bridge. Such defects are very difficult to detect. Although well established, Lamb wave based nondestructive evaluation techniques are revisited and new tools are developed to address this issue. Simulation of the scattered ultrasonic wave field is carried out using the finite element method. This ultrasonic wave field is further analyzed to evaluate the integrity of the structure using various feature extraction (FE) techniques. Joint time-frequency-energy representation is obtained from ultrasonic signals recorded at various locations on the <b>plate</b> (<b>joint</b> panel) and used to extract damage sensitive features. Those features were then used to formulate a new Damage Parameter (DP) for better visualization of the crack. Results are shown to demonstrate the comparative effectiveness of these techniques. It is concluded that any particular FE technique cannot detect all possible sizes and orientations of the crack. It is suggested that the statistical occurrence and pattern of the crack must be visualized through a few selective FE techniques in a sequence. Modeling of the wave scattering phenomenon by conventional numerical techniques such as finite element method requires very fine mesh at high frequencies necessitating heavy computational power. Distributed point source method (DPSM) which is a recently developed semi-analytical technique, is applied to model the scattering of ultrasonic wave field on representative problem geometries and the results are used to diagnose structural damages. DPSM is a newly developed robust mesh-free technique for simulating ultrasonic, electrostatic and electromagnetic field problems. In most of the previous studies the DPSM technique has been applied to model two dimensional surface geometries and relatively simple three dimensional scatterer geometries. It has been very difficult to perform the wave scattering analysis for very complex three-dimensional geometries. This technique has been extended to model wave scattering in an arbitrary geometry. The simulation has been carried out with and without the presence of cracks near the rivet holes...|$|E
40|$|The {{competitiveness}} of timber as structural material in large structures is often {{governed by the}} cost of structural joints. Tests indicate that the new joint concept presented herein using glued wood-to-steel <b>plate</b> <b>joints</b> can possibly reduce the cost by matching joint strength to member strength. The design is inspired by two previously proposed designs using a single large dowel and using a rubber foil interlayer in adhesive joints. Analytical 1 D and numerical 3 D models of the bond line are proposed {{in order to further}} develop the concept, both {{in the case of a}} traditional adhesive joint and for the innovative rubber foil adhesive joint. The glued wood-to-steel <b>plate</b> <b>joints</b> studied are lap joints with a load bearing capacity assumed to be governed by failure within or along the bond line. In the 1 D and 3 D structural models both linear elastic and non-linear fracture mechanics were applied, with the non-linear fracture mechanics model taking into account the gradual damage fracture softening in a fracture zone. For the conventional type of bond line it was found that bond line softening needs to be considered for adequate strength analysis while it was not needed for a bond line with a rubber foil. The computational results are compared to previous full scale test results. The numerical results show good agreement and the analytical results reasonable agreement. When using a high strength adhesive, the strength of the wood along the bond line is governing joint failure. For this case, the analyses predict a 150 % load bearing capacity increase by the introduction of a rubber foil as compared to a traditional design.
