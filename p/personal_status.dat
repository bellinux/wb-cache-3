5|$|Courts {{are divided}} into three categories: civil, religious, and special. The civil courts deal with civil and {{criminal}} matters, including cases brought against the government. The civil courts include Magistrate Courts, Courts of First Instance, Courts of Appeal, High Administrative Courts which hear cases relating to administrative matters, and the Constitutional Court which {{was set up in}} 2012 in order to hear cases regarding the constitutionality of laws. Although Islam is the state religion, the constitution preserves a degree of religious and personal freedom. Religious law only extends to matters of <b>personal</b> <b>status</b> such as divorce and inheritance in religious courts, and is partially based on Islamic Sharia law. The special court deals with cases forwarded by the civil one.|$|E
5|$|Large {{numbers of}} Christians from {{throughout}} Jordan, particularly from al-Salt, {{have moved to}} Amman. Nearby Fuheis is a predominantly Christian town located to the northwest of the city. A small Armenian Catholic community of around 70 families {{is present in the}} city. Ecclesiastical courts for matters of <b>personal</b> <b>status</b> are also located in Amman. A total of 16 historic churches are located in Umm ar-Rasas ruins in Al-Jeezah district; the site is believed to have initially served as Roman fortified military camps which gradually became a town around the 5th century AD. It has not been completely excavated. It was influenced by several civilizations including the Romans, Byzantines and Muslims. The site contains some well-preserved mosaic floors, particularly the mosaic floor of the Church of Saint Stephen.|$|E
5|$|The Saudi {{system of}} justice {{has been criticized for}} being slow, arcane, lacking in some of the {{safeguards}} of justice and unable to deal with the modern world. In 2007, King Abdullah issued royal decrees with the aim of reforming the judiciary and creating a new court system. The reforms have yet to be implemented in full but, once they are, will include the creation of a Supreme Court and the transfer of the Board of Grievances' commercial and criminal jurisdictions to a restructured general court system. New specialist first instance courts will be established comprising general, criminal, <b>personal</b> <b>status,</b> commercial and labor courts. The Sharia courts will therefore lose their general jurisdiction to hear all cases and the work load of the government's administrative tribunals will be transferred to the new courts. Another important change is the establishment of appeal courts for each province. It has been claimed that the reforms will establish a system for codifying Sharia and incorporating the principle of judicial precedent into court practice.|$|E

40|$|Objective: We {{investigated}} {{the accuracy of}} self-reported family history for diabetes, hypertension, and overweight against two reference standards: family history based on physician-assessed health status of relatives and on self-reported <b>personal</b> health <b>status</b> of relatives. Study Design and Setting: Subjects were participants from the Erasmus Rucphen Family study, an extended family study among descendants of 20 couples who lived between 1850 and 1900 in a southwest region of the Netherlands and their relatives (n = 1, 713). Sensitivity and specificity of self-reported family history were calculated. Results: Sensitivity of self-reported family history was 89. 2 % for diabetes, 92. 2 % for hypertension, and 78. 4 % for overweight when family history based on relatives' self-reported <b>personal</b> health <b>status</b> was used as reference and 70. 8 % for diabetes, 67. 4 % for hypertension, and 77. 3 % for overweight when physician-assessed health status of relatives was used. Sensitivity and specificity of self-reported <b>personal</b> health <b>status</b> were 76. 8 % and 98. 8 % for diabetes, 38. 9 % and 98. 0 % for hypertension, and 80. 9 % and 75. 7 % for overweight, respectively. Conclusion: The accuracy of self-reported family history of diabetes and hypertension is strongly influenced by the accuracy of self-reported <b>personal</b> health <b>status</b> of relatives. Raising awareness of <b>personal</b> health <b>status</b> is crucial to ensure the utility of family history {{for the assessment of}} risk and disease prevention. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

25|$|A Code of <b>Personal</b> <b>Status</b> {{was adopted}} shortly after {{independence}} in 1956, which, among other things, gave women full legal status (allowing {{them to run}} and own businesses, have bank accounts, and seek passports under their own authority). The code outlawed the practices of polygamy and repudiation and a husband's right to unilaterally divorce his wife. Further reforms in 1993 included a provision to allow Tunisian women to transmit citizenship {{even if they are}} married to a foreigner and living abroad. The Law of <b>Personal</b> <b>Status</b> is applied to all Tunisians regardless of their religion.

For instance, the Islamic <b>personal</b> <b>status</b> laws are inspired by the Sharia law. For Muslims, these tribunals deal with questions of marriage, divorce, custody, and inheritance and wills. For non-Muslims, <b>personal</b> <b>status</b> jurisdiction is split: the law of inheritance and wills falls under national civil jurisdiction, while Christian and Jewish religious courts are competent for marriage, divorce, and custody. Catholics can additionally appeal before the Vatican Rota court.|$|E

Drawing on these experiences, I argue that students’ education is impacted by legal and social exclusion, family stress and psychosocial impacts, <b>personal</b> legal <b>status,</b> and a lack of services for undocumented students and children of undocumented immigrants in educational institutions. I also argue that mothers and other family members lessen these challenges by providing students with the support and encouragement to complete a higher education.

40|$|Background Parents’ labour {{migration}} generates {{new types of}} families – transnational family, where one parent or both parents migrate and leave their children behind.

The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse the situation of adolescents who experience separation from their parent/parents caused by {{labour migration}}, especially how temporary absence of the parent is associated with the adolescents’ personal identity. Participants and procedure Participants were 99 high school youth from transnational families and 76 from non-transnational families who were asked to fill out the following measures: Identity Development Scale (U-GIDS) (Meeus, 1996; Rostowski, 1997), the in­terview questionnaire to collect information about parents’ migration.
