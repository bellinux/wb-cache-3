5|$|Minnesota {{has some}} of the Earth's oldest rocks, gneisses that are about 3.6 billion years old (80 percent as old as the planet). About 2.7 billion years ago, basaltic lava <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> cracks in the floor of the {{primordial}} ocean; the remains of this volcanic rock formed the Canadian Shield in northeast Minnesota. The roots of these volcanic mountains and the action of Precambrian seas formed the Iron Range of northern Minnesota. Following a period of volcanism 1.1 billion years ago, Minnesota's geological activity has been more subdued, with no volcanism or mountain formation, but with repeated incursions of the sea, which left behind multiple strata of sedimentary rock.|$|E
5|$|While Adams {{tried to}} reassert {{control of the}} meeting, people <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Old South Meeting House and headed to Boston Harbor. That evening, a group of 30 to 130 men boarded the three vessels, some of them thinly {{disguised}} as Mohawk Indians, and dumped all 342 chests of tea into the water {{over the course of}} three hours. Adams never revealed whether he went to the wharf to witness the destruction of the tea. Whether or not he helped plan the event is unknown, but Adams immediately worked to publicize and defend it. He argued that the Tea Party was not the act of a lawless mob, but was instead a principled protest and the only remaining option that the people had to defend their constitutional rights.|$|E
5|$|With {{the loss}} of Bucher and his aircraft, the C-130 Hercules had not {{completed}} a successful evacuation, and {{there were more than}} 600 people still on the ground. Next in line was Lieutenant Colonel William Boyd; he was flying an airlift mission into Chu Lai, until he was diverted into Khâm Đức to extract forces and civilians there. Just before Boyd touched down, an artillery shell exploded about 100 feet in front of his aircraft, so he was forced to pull the throttle forward. Boyd then pulled up and went around for a second approach, because he could see the desperation {{of the people on the}} ground. As he landed, hundreds of civilians and soldiers <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ditches and rushed onto the aircraft. Because he had witnessed the destruction of Bucher's C-130 while taking off in the north direction, Boyd decided to fly out from the southwest. After Boyd's aircraft was airborne, he banked the aircraft so it would be masked by the rolling terrain. The aircraft sustained damages to the left wing, the fuselage, and the leading edge of both wings, but it landed safely in Chu Lai with all the passengers.|$|E

Duquesnoy's {{division}} departed Flaumont at 6:00 am and marched through Beugnies, Dimont and Dimechaux. Supported by a plentiful artillery, the French infantry drove two Austrian battalions out of Wattignies, but as the French <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the other side of the}} village they were met by an infantry-cavalry counterattack. Duquesnoy's soldiers abandoned Wattignies and retreated to Dimechaux and Dimont.|$|E
25|$|D Company landed {{very close}} to their {{objectives}} at 16 minutes past midnight (the first Allied unit to land in France). The soldiers <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their battered gliders, completely surprising the German defenders, and taking the bridges within 10 minutes, losing two men – Lieutenant Den Brotheridge and Lance corporal Fred Greenhalgh – in the process. A further two officers and 14 soldiers were wounded during {{the battle for the}} bridges. Lieutenant Den Brotheridge led the first platoon to land at Pegasus Bridge followed one minute later by Lieutenant David Wood's platoon. Lieutenant Dennis Fox led the first platoon to land at Horsa Bridge. The glider carrying Captain Brian Priday and Lieutenant Tony Hooper's platoon, which was assigned to the capture of Horsa Bridge, landed at the bridge over the River Dives, some seven miles from where they intended. In spite of this, the occupants of the glider captured the River Dives bridge, advanced through the German lines towards the village of Ranville where they eventually rejoined the British forces. The Ox and Bucks platoons holding the bridges were relieved by the 7th Battalion of the Parachute Regiment at 03:00hours. The Germans attempted to re-capture the bridges, but were repulsed. Later in the day, at about 13:00hrs, Lord Lovat and elements of the Commandos of his 1st Special Service Brigade arrived to relieve the exhausted defenders, followed by the 3rd British Infantry Division. The operation was immortalised in the film The Longest Day.|$|E
500|$|The peak {{rainfall}} {{occurred in a}} small area centered near the Pecos River. A location along the Johnson Draw reported [...] of rainfall after receiving minimal precipitation in the previous three years. In addition, some locals in western Texas experienced rainfall from Alice that exceed yearly averages. This contributed to significant flooding along the Pecos River, reaching a flood stage of [...] in Pandale. The flooding swept away a group of fishermen in Sheffield {{as well as at}} a location 10mi (16km) north of Pandale, killing four. Downstream, the river crested at , which washed out a highway and three railroad bridges. A temporary bridge was built between Eagle Pass and Piedro Negro by July10, or two weeks after the storm. The destroyed rail lines stranded a Sunset Limited train, which prompted the passengers to evacuate to nearby Langtry. The flooding also stranded a Southern Pacific train, whose occupants were later evacuated by helicopters. The peak river crest corresponded to a discharge rate of 948,000ft³/s (26,800m³/s), which the International Boundary and Water Commission remarked was [...] "probably the greatest rate of runoff for a watershed of [...] size in the United States." [...] Heavy rain fell across all of southern Texas and northern Mexico as a result of Alice, causing flash floods in inland areas. Ozona, Texas was the town most affected by the floods, sustaining $2million in damage (1954USD), as well as 15deaths. Early on the morning of June25, a [...] "wall of water" [...] as high as 30feet (9.2m) <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a dry gully and overwhelmed most of the town. Roughly a third of Ozona had to be evacuated, and many livestock there were killed. About 500families were left homeless in the town. United States military helicopters worked to rescue people trapped by the floodwaters. In all, at least seven towns experienced flooding from the storm {{on either side of the}} border, including Lamesa and Laredo, Texas which were badly damaged by flash floods.|$|E

Her father sought advice on the matter, and, although he did not have much money, he was able to supply her with books suited, as he had been told, to the capacity of a child her age. But soon her parents found that her abilities were far beyond her years. Constantia was tutored in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, English, and French by her local vicar, but was mostly self-educated. According to one editor she was [...] "a most excellent scholar, not only in Greek and Roman literature, but in history, divinity, philosophy, and mathematics: and what makes her character the more remarkable is, that she died so early as the age of 27, and that she acquired this great learning merely by the force of her own genius, and continual application."

2500|$|Regarding {{the sheer}} size of Callas's instrument, Celletti says, [...] "Her voice was penetrating. The volume as such was average: neither small nor powerful. But the penetration, allied to this incisive quality (which bordered on the ugly because it {{frequently}} contained an element of harshness) ensured that her voice could be clearly heard anywhere in the auditorium." [...] Rodolfo Celletti wrote that Callas had [...] "a voluminous, penetrating, and dark voice" [...] ("una voce voluminosa, squillante e di timbro scuro"). After her first performance of Medea in 1953, the critic for Musical Courier wrote that [...] "she displayed a vocal generosity that was scarcely believable for its amplitude and resilience." [...] In a 1982 Opera News interview with Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge, Bonynge stated, [...] "But before she slimmed down, I mean this was such a colossal voice. It just <b>poured</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her, the way Flagstad's did.... Callas had a huge voice. When she and Stignani sang Norma, {{at the bottom of the}} range you could barely tell who was who ... Oh it was colossal. And she took the big sound right up to the top." [...] In his book, Michael Scott makes the distinction that whereas Callas's pre-1954 voice was a [...] "dramatic soprano with an exceptional top", after the weight loss, it became, as one Chicago critic described the voice in Lucia, a [...] "huge soprano leggiero".|$|E

Sony also did not have any headsets available for filming, while three pairs Bobbitt found on eBay cost around $1,800 and were not the exact model. Bobbitt eventually created six from scratch for Vol. 2. Other props he created for the film included two sets of blasters for Quill, with removable blaster cartridges, and [...] "steampunk-looking weapons and belts" [...] for the Ravagers; Bobbitt explained that four different weapons were designed for the latter group, and then 15–20 versions of those were produced to be used by the various Ravager actors (there could be up to 85–95 Ravagers per scene). For their belts, the props team cut the leather themselves rather than buying existing belts, and then parts from different electronic devices such as radios and cell phones were glued together to make each belt [...] "a unique piece of art".

He was also given the authority to hold the standard in the battle. Once he had made it to the river, he started filling the bag with water. Abbas's loyalty to Hussein was so great that, though he was very thirsty, Abbas drank no water because he could not bear the thought that Sakinah was thirsty. This story illustrates how Abbas conquered the Euphrates river, held it with his mighty hands, yet still did not drink. After gathering the water, Abbas rode back towards the camp. On his way back, he was struck from behind, and one of his arms was amputated. Then he was struck from behind again, amputating his other arm. Abbas continued, carrying the water-bag in his mouth.
