40|$|C 1 - Journal Articles RefereedBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Helicobacter pylori is a {{major cause}} of peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. Vaccine {{development}} is progressing but there is concern that immunisation may exacerbate Helicobacter induced gastritis: <b>prophylactic</b> <b>immunisation</b> followed by challenge with H felis or H pylori can induce a more severe gastritis in mice than seen with infection alone. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship between immunity to Helicobacter infection and post-immunisation gastritis. METHODS: (1) C 57 BL/ 6 mice were prophylactically immunised before challenge with either H felis or H pylori. Histopathology and colonisation were assessed one month post-challenge. (2) C 57 BL/ 6 mice were prophylactically immunised against H felis infection and gastritis assessed up to 18 months post-challenge. RESULTS: <b>Prophylactic</b> <b>immunisation</b> induced a reduction in bacterial colonisation following H felis challenge which was associated with increased severity of active gastritis with neutrophil infiltration and atrophy. However, immunised mice challenged with H pylori SS 1 had little evidence of pathology. Long term follow up showed that post-immunisation gastritis was evident at three months. However, from six months onwards, although immunised/challenged mice still developed gastritis, there was no significant difference between inflammation in these mice and infected controls. Post-immunisation gastritis was not associated with the serum antibody response. Immunisation prevented the formation of secondary lymphoid aggregates in the gastric tissue. CONCLUSION: The H felis mouse model of post-immunisation gastritis is the most extreme example of this type of pathology. We have shown in this model that post-immunisation gastritis is a transient event which does not produce long term exacerbation of pathology. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E
40|$|Neonatal {{breast milk}} from 50 babies aged between 2 and 39 days was studied for the {{presence}} of antibody to the cows' milk protein beta lactoglobulin. Specific IgA antibody and specific secretory antibody to beta lactoglobulin were detectable {{towards the end of the}} second week of life in milk secreted by neonates fed cows' milk formula. Specific antibody concentrations were independent of total IgA concentrations. Babies receiving little or no cows' milk protein did not produce antibody in neonatal breast milk. Antigen specific mucosal immune responses develop in tissues distant from the site of primary mucosal exposure by the end of the second week of life in term human neonates, suggesting that <b>prophylactic</b> <b>immunisation</b> against enteric or other mucosal pathogens within a few days of birth may provide antibody responses in secretions, which may protect against mucosal infection...|$|E
40|$|ErbB- 2 is {{associated}} with several solid tumours of which breast cancer is the commonest cancer in women worldwide. Though anti-ErbB- 2 antibody appears to {{play a significant role}} in prevention and therapy, naturally occurring anti-ErbB- 2 antibody associated with the cleaved ectodomain of overexpressed ErbB- 2 self antigen is detectable in patients. It is therefore essential to understand the course of antibody mediated protection during disease progression. 100 % of FVB/N neu mice expressing mutated, constitutively active ErbB- 2 develop mammary carcinoma. It has been shown that vaccination with ErbB- 2 associated with a T helper cell epitope P 30 can offer protection against transplantable tumour but it is unclear whether the same vaccine protects against naturally developing tumour. We have analysed the course of the disease following prophylactic, and therapeutic vaccination in this spontaneous, eutopic mammary carcinoma model that more closely resembles the human disease. 100 % protection against tumour development was observed subsequent to <b>prophylactic</b> <b>immunisation</b> but disease progression was unaffected by therapeutic vaccination. The antibody response exhibited restricted expansion of the Immunoglobulin (Ig) variable (V) -gene repertoire by ErbB- 2 specific B cells compared with the non-antigen specific B cell pool and control mice. The serum antibody profile was similar in therapeutically injected mice without any effect on tumour burden...|$|E
40|$|Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} induces {{an important}} systemic and mucosal antibody response and a predominant Th 1 cellular response. These immune responses, although powerful, fail {{to eliminate the}} infection. Studies in animals have shown that <b>prophylactic</b> and therapeutic <b>immunisations</b> are efficacious, although complete protective immunity has usually not been achieved. Initial human trials with recombinant urease showed that a mucosal immune response can be obtained following immunisations, with a decrease in bacterial density, but successful immunisation is still awaited. Progress is being made in several areas of vaccine design. A human vaccine against H. pylori would be favourable in terms of health benefits and costs in developed and developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Bioethics {{committees}} {{have issued}} guidelines that medical interventions should be permissible only {{in cases of}} clinically verifiable disease, deformity, or injury. Furthermore, once the existence {{of one or more}} of these requirements has been proven, the proposed therapeutic procedure must reasonably be expected to result in a net benefit to the patient. As an exception to this rule, some prophylactic interventions might be performed on individuals "in their best interests" or with the aim of averting an urgent and potentially calamitous public health danger. In order to invoke these exceptions, a stringent set of criteria must first be satisfied. Additionally, where the proposed prophylactic intervention is intended for children, who are unlikely to be able to provide a meaningfully informed consent, a heightened scrutiny of any such measures is required. We argue that children should not be subjected to prophylactic interventions "in their best interests" or for public health reasons when there exist effective and conservative alternative interventions, such as behavioural modification, that individuals could employ as competent adolescents or adults to avoid adverse health outcomes. Applying these criteria, we consider the specific examples of <b>prophylactic</b> mastectomy, <b>immunisations,</b> cosmetic ear surgery, and circumcision...|$|R
40|$|A generic {{approach}} to inducing high level CD 8 + T cell responses {{would be of}} value for <b>prophylactic</b> and therapeutic <b>immunisation</b> against several infectious diseases. However, {{it has been very}} difficult to achieve such immune responses using available vaccination strategies. Malaria is one of several diseases against which a new generation of better CD 8 + T cell-inducing vaccines might be useful and is unusual in that it allows assessment of vaccine efficacy in small numbers of volunteers in carefully controlled challenge studies. Here we review the identification of a heterologous prime-boost regime using DNA priming and recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) boosting that induces high level T cell responses in both mice and non-human primates. Clinical trials to determine whether this prime-boost approach is immunogenic in humans are in progress...|$|R
40|$|People {{who have}} had a {{splenectomy}} for any reason are 40 {{times more likely to have}} an overwhelming infection, especially pneumococcal infection, and 17 times more likely to suffer fatal sepsis. The incidence of such life threatening infections is reduced by <b>prophylactic</b> <b>immunisation</b> with polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine and long term antibiotic prophylaxis or instituting prompt antibiotic treatment in the event of fever. This haematology unit agreed a policy of immunisation and antibiotic prophylaxis in June 1988 for all patients undergoing elective splenectomy. The success of this policy was audited in July 1993 by a retrospective analysis of patients' case notes. Seventy four patients were identified as having had a splenectomy, 54 (73 %) before June 1988, of whom only 13 (24 %) had received both pneumococcal immunisation and antibiotic prophylaxis before implementation of the agreed policy. At the time of audit, 46 / 74 (62 %) patients were recorded as having received immunisation and 64 / 74 (86 %) as receiving antibiotic prophylaxis or a supply of antibiotics to take in the event of a fever. All but one of the 20 patients who had a splenectomy after June 1988, since implementation of the agreed policy, received immunisation and antibiotic prophylaxis. The authors conclude that establishment of a formal agreed policy for pneumococcal prophylaxis for patients undergoing splenectomy has improved the quality of care...|$|E

40|$|Newcastle disease (ND), {{caused by}} Newcastle disease virus, is an acute, {{contagious}} and pathogenic infection of pet, free living and domestic birds. ND is an epidemic disease {{and it is}} responsible for high economic losses due to up to 100 % mortality. The control of ND in the intensive commercial poultry farms is largely dependent on <b>prophylactic</b> <b>immunisation</b> using conventional vaccines. The ND V 4 vaccine and its derivative ND V 4 -HR vaccine were selected originally for use in village chickens, due to their immunogenicity, thermostability, transmissibility and ease of administration. The efficacy of V 4 and V 4 HR vaccines have been established in many Asian and African countries {{in their ability to}} challenge a wide range of recognised and local velogenic NDV. Therefore, ND V 4 was tested for efficacy against B 1172 challenge NDV isolated in south Africa in 1993. Twenty-eight one day-old replacement pullets were vaccinated by eye-drop route at 21 and 49 days old. Chickens vaccinated by eye-drop route were left to mingle with the unvaccinated in-contact chickens. At 63 days all chickens including the unvaccinated control group were individually challenged with B 1172 NDV. Serological monitoring of NDV antibody response was done using HI and ELISA tests. The ND V 4 vaccine induced full protection against B 1172 NDV in chickens vaccinated by eye-drop vaccination and in 55 % of chickens vaccinated by the in-contact method. No association was seen between NDV antibody titer at pre-challenge and the ability to withstand B 1172 challenge NDV. A fair to good agreement was seen between the HI and ELISA test in monitoring NDV antibody response during the experiment. Although, the ELISA showed a higher sensitivity and specificity than the HI test, further studies are required using this method of comparison.

40|$|The {{safety of}} {{attenuated}} poxviruses in HIV- 1 -infected individuals {{is an important}} consideration in their application as vaccine vectors, first, because new HIV- 1 infections may occur in vaccine trials involving persons {{at high risk of}} infection and secondly, therapeutic vaccinations are a potential means to enhance virus-specific immune responses once infection has occurred. We administered a candidate modified vaccinia virus Ankara-vectored HIV- 1 vaccine, MVA. HIVA, by intradermal injection to 16 chronically infected adults during highly active antiretroviral therapy. Vaccinations were well tolerated and there were no serious adverse events. No breakthrough viraemia occurred after immunisations or throughout follow-up. These data confirm the safety of MVA. HIVA in HIV- 1 -infected individuals and provide support for further evaluation of MVA-vectored vaccines in <b>prophylactic</b> and therapeutic <b>immunisation</b> strategies...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although fever {{is part of}} {{the normal}} {{inflammatory}} process after <b>immunisation,</b> <b>prophylactic</b> antipyretic drugs are sometimes recommended to allay concerns of high fever and febrile convulsion. We assessed the effect of prophylactic administration of paracetamol at vaccination on infant febrile reaction rates and vaccine responses. METHODS: In two consecutive (primary and booster) randomised, controlled, open-label vaccination studies, 459 healthy infants were enrolled from ten centres in the Czech Republic. Infants were randomly assigned with a computer-generated randomisation list to receive three prophylactic paracetamol doses every 6 - 8 h in the first 24 h (n= 226) or no prophylactic paracetamol (n= 233) after each vaccination with a ten-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D-conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) co-administered with the hexavalent diphtheria-tetanus- 3 -component acellular pertussis-hepatitis B-inactivated poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 -H influenzae type b (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib) and oral human rotavirus vaccines. The primary objective in both studies was the reduction in febrile reactions of 38. 0 degrees C or greater in the total vaccinated cohort. The second objective was assessment of immunogenicity in the according-to-protocol cohort. These studies are registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, numbers NCT 00370318 and NCT 00496015. FINDINGS: Fever greater than 39. 5 degrees C was uncommon in both groups (after primary: one of 226 participants [< 1 %] in prophylactic paracetamol group vs three of 233 [1 %] in no prophylactic paracetamol group; after booster: three of 178 [2 %] vs two of 172 [1 %]). The percentage of children with temperature of 38 degrees C or greater after at least one dose was significantly lower in the prophylactic paracetamol group (94 / 226 [42 %] after primary vaccination and 64 / 178 [36 %] after booster vaccination) than in the no prophylactic paracetamol group (154 / 233 [66 %] after primary vaccination and 100 / 172 [58 %] after booster vaccination). Antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) were significantly lower in the prophylactic paracetamol group than in the no prophylactic paracetamol group after primary vaccination for all ten pneumococcal vaccine serotypes, protein D, antipolyribosyl-ribitol phosphate, antidiphtheria, antitetanus, and antipertactin. After boosting, lower antibody GMCs persisted in the prophylactic paracetamol group for antitetanus, protein D, and all pneumococcal serotypes apart from 19 F. INTERPRETATION: Although febrile reactions significantly decreased, prophylactic administration of antipyretic drugs at the time of vaccination should not be routinely recommended since antibody responses to several vaccine antigens were reduced.

40|$|DNA {{plasmids}} encoding {{the open}} reading frames of canine oral papillomavirus (COPV) nonstructural early genes E 1, E 2, or E 7 protein were delivered into both oral mucosal and cutaneous epithelial sites in beagle dogs using particle-mediated immunotherapeutic delivery (PMID) technology. Control dogs were vaccinated with plasmid encoding either hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBVs) or COPV L 1. Using a <b>prophylactic</b> <b>immunisation</b> protocol, a priming dose of plasmid DNA {{was followed by}} a booster dose 6 weeks later. Four weeks after boost, all dogs were challenged with infectious COPV particles. Following viral challenge, as shown previously (M. A. Stanley et al., 2001, Vaccine 19, 2783 - 2792), mucosal papillomas developed in the negative-control HBVs vaccinated dogs, but all animals in the COPV L 1 group were fully protected from disease development. In the early gene-vaccinated groups five of six in the E 1 -vaccinated dogs, two of six in E 2 -vaccinated dogs, and three of six in the E 7 -vaccinated beagles developed oral papillomas. Compared to the HBVs negative-control group the oral papillomas that did develop in the early-gene vaccinated beagles were significantly smaller, shorter in duration, and fewer in number. Taken together the disease burden was markedly reduced and this was statistically significant. In a second experiment one group of animals was vaccinated with plasmid encoding the wild-type COPV E 1 gene, and a separate group was vaccinated with plasmid encoding a synthetic codon-optimised COPV E 1 gene sequence. None of the codon-optimised E 1 -vaccinated animals developed papillomas at any challenge site. However, all animals vaccinated with wild-type E 1 had papillomas. These data suggest that immunisation by PMID with papillomavirus early genes can significantly impact upon subsequent disease development and that full protection can be achieved using improved vectors encoding codon-optimised gene sequences perhaps emphasizing the importance of antigen load in the generation of protective responses to papillomavirus proteins...|$|E
40|$|Smithburn (1949) {{reported}} that humoral immunity to Rift Valley fever (R. V. F.), transmitted from an immune ewe to her twin lambs, persisted {{for about five}} months and was not affected by weaning. He postulated {{that this might be}} of practical value in protecting young lambs during the period of maximum susceptibility to Rift Valley Fever virus. In the Republic of South Africa, arthropod-borne diseases of sheep such as Rift Valley fever, Wesselsbron disease and bluetongue occur seasonally during the late summer and autumn, and almost invariably disappear soon after the first frosts of winter. Bearing this in mind, practical use is made of transmitted passive immunity to protect the lambs. Autumn lambing is advocated, and farmers are advised to immunise all their sheep during the spring, first with a polyvalent bluetongue vaccine and later with a combined Rift Valley fever-Wesselsbron vaccine. On account of the abortifacient and embryotropic properties of the neuroadapted Rift Valley fever and Wesselsbron disease viruses which form the basis of the live attenuated virus vaccine, <b>prophylactic</b> <b>immunisation</b> is restricted to non-pregnant animals. At present, for the preparation of the Rift Valley fever vaccine, Smithburn's neurotropic attenuated strain of virus at the 102 nd mouse intracerebral passage level is used. Mulligan (1937) prepared a similar type of vaccine from a neurotropic strain of virus at the 92 nd mouse passage level. He {{reported that}} “the vaccine proved safe for lambs six weeks old and produced a good immunity. Tested in the field, on a large number of pregnant ewes and newly born lambs, this vaccine was found to be unsafe for the newly born lambs and to cause abortion in some of the pregnant ewes. Vaccination of pregnant ewes, moreover, did not appear to result in the transfer of the immune bodies through the colostrum to the lamb although, in this connection, it must be stated that lambing had started at the time vaccination was practised and the interval between inoculation and the birth of a lamb was never more than a few days. It became apparent, however, that the vaccine, while it might be of service in protecting maiden ewes, was not suitable for controlling an outbreak in pregnant ewes and very young lambs. " Kaschula (1953) using Smithburn's neurotropic virus at the 86 th passage level reported abortions among pregnant ewes and the death of lambs shortly after birth under field conditions in South Africa. The investigations reported in this communication were undertaken initially to determine the effect of the strain of Rift Valley fever virus incorporated in the vaccine on pregnant ewes and day-old lambs. During the course of the investigations valuable information was obtained on the nature and duration of transmitted immunity in lambs and the immune response of day-old lambs to the neurotropic strain of Rift Valley fever virus.
