40|$|An {{approach}} to <b>practice</b> research is presented. The main ideas of <b>practice</b> research is 1) {{to consider the}} empirical field in terms of <b>practices,</b> 2) to develop knowledge through situational inquiries into local operational <b>practices</b> based on problems and needs in such <b>practices</b> and 3) to contribute with abstract useful knowledge to general <b>practice</b> and research community. This means that <b>practice</b> research is research about <b>practices,</b> research from <b>practices,</b> research for <b>practices,</b> research with <b>practices</b> and usually research in <b>practices.</b> <b>Practice</b> research {{is divided into two}} closely related sub-practices: situational inquiry and theorizing. <b>Practice</b> research is also related to three target practices/communities: local operational <b>practice,</b> general <b>practice</b> and research community. The paper also contains ontological assumptions (from <b>practice</b> theories) and epistemological assumptions (from pragmatist epistemology). Three examples of <b>practice</b> research are briefly described as illustrations. The main purpose of the paper is to describe the research <b>practice</b> of <b>practice</b> research...|$|R

In conclusion, culture in Jordan has a huge influences eating <b>practices</b> and food choice.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The <b>practice</b> setting is, {{next to the}} GP and staff, an {{important}} determinant {{of the quality of}} care. Differences between single-handed <b>practices</b> and group <b>practices</b> in <b>practice</b> management and organization could therefore provide clues for improvement. An explorative, cross sectional survey was conducted in 766 general <b>practices</b> in The Netherlands comparing single-handed <b>practices</b> with group <b>practices.</b> OBJECTIVE: The study is looking for answers on aspects of the organization and management that are lost or gained when single-handed GPs and <b>practices</b> are replaced by group <b>practices.</b> METHODS: Between 1999 and 2003 GPs and their <b>practices</b> were assessed using a validated <b>practice</b> visit method (VIP) consisting of 303 indicators describing 56 dimensions of <b>practice</b> management. Instruments used consisted of questionnaires for patients, GPs, <b>practice</b> assistant and a direct observer in the <b>practice.</b> Single-handed <b>practices</b> (1 GP) were compared to group <b>practices</b> or health centres (> 2. 0 GPs) comparing raw scores on dimensions of <b>practice</b> management. In addition, data were analysed in a regression model with specific aspects of <b>practice</b> management as dependent variables using a general linear model procedure. Independent variables included 'single-handed/group practice', 'rural/ urban' 'part-time/full-time' and 'male/female'. RESULTS: Group <b>practices</b> scored better on nearly all aspects of infrastructure except those rated by patients. Patients gave single-handed <b>practices</b> higher marks for service, accessibility and even for the facilities. In single-handed <b>practices</b> GPs reported that they worked more and experienced higher levels of job stress. They delegated less of the medical technical tasks but there is no difference in delegation of preventive tasks/treatment of chronic diseases. Group <b>practices</b> had more computerized medical information and more quality assurance activities, but gave less patient information. Single-handed <b>practices</b> spent more hours on continuous medical education. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The quality of the <b>practice</b> infrastructure and the team scored better in group <b>practices,</b> but patients appreciated the single-handed <b>practice</b> better. The advantages of single-handed <b>practices</b> could be a challenge for group <b>practices</b> to give better personal, continuous care and to put the patient perspective before organizational considerations. This is underlined by the better score on patient information of single-handed <b>practices.</b> Single-handed <b>practices</b> can reduce their vulnerability and openness to high demand by opening up to the requirements of organised primary care...|$|R

40|$|Aim: This {{paper is}} a report of a study to {{identify}} factors influencing advanced <b>practice</b> nurses’ contribution to promoting evidence-based <b>practice</b> among front-line nurses. Background: Despite widespread recognition that care should be evidence-based, nurses experience challenges implementing evidence-based <b>practice.</b> As opinion leaders, advanced <b>practice</b> nurses can influence the <b>practice</b> of front-line nurses by promoting research use. Little is known about how advanced <b>practice</b> nurses use evidence and their influence on care provided by front-line nurses. Method: A cross-sectional survey of 855 advanced <b>practice</b> nurses working in 87 hospital/primary care settings in England. The questionnaire examined understandings of evidence-based <b>practice,</b> sources of evidence used, ways of working with front-line nurses, perceived impact on front-line nurses, skills in evidence-based <b>practice</b> and barriers to promoting evidence-based <b>practice.</b> Data were collected in 2005 and analysed using descriptive statistics. Comparisons were made between advanced <b>practice</b> nurses with master’s qualifications and those with lower qualifications. Findings: Advanced <b>practice</b> nurses used different sources of evidence. They engaged in various activities to promote evidence-based <b>practice</b> and had {{a positive influence on}} front-line nurses’ <b>practice.</b> Advanced <b>practice</b> nurses’ skills in evidence-based <b>practice</b> varied with few considering themselves expert. Advanced <b>practice</b> nurses with master’s qualifications perceived themselves to be more skilled in all aspects of evidence-based <b>practice</b> that those with lower qualifications. Conclusion: Advanced <b>practice</b> nurses are well-placed as clinical leaders to promote evidence-based <b>practice</b> by front-line nurses but require further development of their skills in evidence-based <b>practice.</b> In order to maximize their potential, advanced <b>practice</b> nurses require master’s preparation. </p...|$|R
