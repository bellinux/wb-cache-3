A coin that is not gold or below the expected fineness will either have the right size but will a lower than expected weight or it weighs right and will be somewhat larger. Most metals that are of similar or higher density than gold are similarly or more expensive, and were unknown in ancient times (notably the platinum group). During the 19th century <b>platinium</b> was cheaper than gold and was used for counterfeiting gold coins. These coins could be detected by acoustic properties.

40|$|CREDITOR RIGHTS AND RISK-TAKING PURPOSE OF THE STUDY In this Master’s thesis I {{study how}} {{creditor}} rights affect risk-taking of companies. Firstly, I analyze whether {{the level of}} creditor protection {{is associated with a}} higher probability of a diversifying acquisition. Secondly, I assess whether creditor protection is associated with a less risky mode of operation. Thirdly, I analyze factors, which could increase the probability of a diversifying acquisition. The main focus will be given to creditor rights’ effect on the probability to do a diversifying acquisition. Other analyses cover creditor rights’ effect on the post-merger performance of diversifying acquisitions, leverage, cash flow risk and the probability of companies operating in a low-recovery asset value industry to acquire a target from a high-recovery value industry. DATA My sample consists of 11785 completed mergers and acquisitions during a period of 1990 – 2010, which is gathered from SDC <b>Platinium.</b> The transactions are from in total of 37 countries. The financial data regarding the sample companies is retrieved from Thomson ONE banker and SDC <b>Platinium.</b> The creditor rights index used as the main explanatory variable is from Djankov et al (2007) and the shareholder rights index is constructed by Spamann (2010). The data of country level data is derived from various sources, mostly from the World bank databases. RESULTS I find an association between the level of creditor protection and probability to do a diversifying acquisition. Also the performance of diversifying acquisitions deteriorates in the strength of creditor rights. Additionally, I find a negative association between the level of creditor protection and leverage. I do not find strong empirical results on the potential association between creditor rights and cash flow risk and the probability of companies operating in a low-recovery asset value industry to acquire a target from a high-recovery value industry.

Catheter ports were implanted percutaneously from a femoral approach in three cases or surgically in the gastroduodenal artery in two cases. Acute abdominal pain developed on average after four HAIC courses of 5 FU-oxaliplatin, mytomycin, oxaliplatin or fotemustine.

We show that the situation is similar to a diffusion-limited kinetic situation (though diffusion was a priori absent from the model). We find the occurrence of a large-scale organization phenomenon at low dimension called segregation, and for a finite size system, a transition to a saturated state at low desorption probability. We show how this transition is affected by the dimen-sionality of the substrate.

Design/methodology/approach: The corrosion resistance tests of samples were carried out by means of potentiodynamic method registering anodic polarization curves in physiological Tyrode’s solution at temperature 37 ± 1 oC. Registering of anodic polarization curves was conducted at the pace of potential change equal to 1 mV/s. As the reference electrode saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was, the auxiliary electrode was <b>platinium</b> electrode. Mechanical properties were evaluated {{on the basis of}} the Vickers hardness test. The test was realized with the use of the CSEM NHT hardness tester. The topography observations of the surface with the DLC coating by means of the confocal laser scanning microscope LEXT OLS 3000 Olympus were carried out. The following surface treatments were applied: barrel finishing, chemical passivation and deposition of DLC coating by means of the RF PACVD and magnetron method. Findings: The investigations revealed diverse corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of the individual samples. The highest corrosion resistance was observed for the barrel finished, passivated and DLC coated samples obtained by means of magnetron method.

40|$|International @ EAU+GBE:PAF:EPU:DLOInternational audiencePhotocatalytic {{process is}} a way to convert H 2 S into H 2 and {{polysulphide}} ions. Under right irradiation, semiconductors could produce photogenerated electrons and holes. Consequently, the overall reaction consists in the reduction of protons into H 2 with photogenerated electrons and the oxidation of sulphide ions with photogenerated holes. The key point is to use photocatalysts that will not be poisoning by by-products. It is also known that photocatalytic H 2 production is a bifunctionnal mechanism needing the presence of a cocatalyst as reduction sites to recombine H atoms into H 2. However, even if <b>platinium</b> particles are largely use as cocatalyst, they could not be use in presence of sulphide. In order to identify the most active photocatalyst for this reaction, several ones have been tested in the photocatalytic H 2 production from H 2 S. The tests have been performed in aqueous solution using Na 2 S as model reactant for dissolved H 2 S. TiO 2, Pt/TiO 2, Ru/TiO 2, ZnS, Ru/ZnS, Ru/ZnO, MoS 2, and ZnS/MoS 2 have been compared. As it could be expected, the presence of reduction sites is necessary to produce H 2. TiO 2, MoO 3 and MoS 2 exhibit no activity. The addition of Pt or Ru particles onto TiO 2 or ZnS leads to the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of the samples. However a desactivation of the catalyst is observed with irradiation time probably due to the poisoning of the cocatalyst. Only Ru/ZnO and MoS 2 /ZnS show a good activity and no or a slight deactivation. In the case of MoS 2 /ZnS, this could be related to a synergetic affect between the photocatalytic properties of ZnS and the ability of MoS 2 to evacute polysulphide by-product...|$|E

The use of the soil-applied herbicides Smerch, Merlin flex and Tendar does not increase the seed yield due to its higher phytotoxicity against milk thistle. Herbicide Tendar and herbicide combination Tendar + Tiger platinum are the most unstable, followed by herbicide Merlin flex. Herbicide tank-mixtures Kalin flo + Tiger platinum and Eclipse + Tiger platinum and herbicide combination Raft + Tiger platinum are technologically the most valuable. They combine high seed yield with high stability with relation to different years. Single application of soil-applied or foliar-applied herbicides have low estimate; due to that they must be combined for full control of weeds in milk thistle crops. ...|$|E
40|$|In daily life, metals {{are used}} in {{everywhere}} {{and they are the}} main parts of technical and mechanical devices. They should be strength enough to endure the conditions in the environment such as pressure, forces, temperature and the hardest one corrosion. Metals have some processes to increase their endurance through such difficulties. One of the easiest ways to increase the metal’s endurance is coating. This method is used in almost all areas such as engineering, ships and electrical devices and even in mechanic industry for protection and endurance. One of the most important areas of metal coating is to inhibit corrosion in metal surface. Metals react with oxygen in daily life. To prevent these oxidation reactions metal coating is used. Zinc, chrome, <b>platinium,</b> etc. Are commonly used in coating metals due to their low oxidation potential they have. In this study, the research was chosen to be “Would endurance for corrosion of different coated metals in salt solution be different?” Zinc, chrome, iron, copper and nickel coated metals, made by same factory and by the same process, was used in the study. Salt solutions prepared and coated metals were sink into these solutions to observe the corrosion or changes. Some changes such as colour change on the metal surfaces and salt solutions were observed {{at the end of the}} experiment. All changes were noted in 5 day interval and after a 30 day period, the metals were compared with each other respect to these changes. It is realised that the best metal which has best endurance to corrosion is chrome. Because, after the 30 day period there is no evidence which shows chrome corrodes. The endurance of metals to corrosion goes from most endurance to less one as copper, nickel, iron, zinc...|$|E
40|$|Sickness Country» (Park Kakadu, Australia) : between myth, {{reality and}} tourism potential. This region {{is found in}} the North Country. Aborigines from the Jawoyn tribe {{consider}} it a territory rendered sacred by their ancestor creator, God Bula. The region lies in the vicinity of Kakadu Park and is put on the UNESCO World Heritage List as Arnhem Territory. Its central part, Sickness Country, concides with the presence of a metal-bearing deposit (gold, <b>platinium</b> and palladium) associated with a high concentration of uranium. Mining, which goes back to the early 1880, has generated some major conflicts, being {{at the same time a}} source of radioactive pollution. Currently, the three types activity going on in the Park have led to acontradictory stance: the exploitation of uranium mine close to Jabiru Town, tourism in the Kakadu Park and Arnhem Territory. Paradoxically, the broad public has not been informed about the geological substrate. As a matter of fact, the aboriginal communities associated to the management of the Park consider that informingthe public would be incompatible with the cultural representation of landscape history expressed in the conception of the God Bula myth, namely, that any disturbance shall unlish the disease the Park is named after. The question is, whether the aboriginal population, ignorant about the radioactivity concept, may somehow be aware of the risks posed by the region, an awareness they have translated to the Bula myth. Viewing things in this way may facilitate some relationships between the rational understanding of environmental dynamics and traditional aboriginal culture, provided real inter-cultural dialog and not merely cohabitation between the two cultures is aimed at. So, when it comes to protected natural sites, the problem is to make a decision between using information, or upholding the traditional representation to boost tourism...|$|E
