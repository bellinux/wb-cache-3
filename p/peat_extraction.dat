5|$|The {{extraction}} of peat from the Moors {{is known to}} have taken place during Roman times, and has been carried out since the Levels were first drained. The introduction of plastic packaging in the 1950s allowed the peat to be packed without rotting, which led to the industrialisation of <b>peat</b> <b>extraction</b> during the 1960s as a major market in horticultural peat was developed. The reduction in water levels that resulted put local ecosystems at risk; peat wastage in pasture fields was occurring at rates of 1–3feet (0.3–0.8m) over 100years. <b>Peat</b> <b>extraction</b> continues today, although much reduced.|$|E

5|$|The low-lying swampy area of Westhay Moor has had peat {{laid down}} over older rocks {{for the last}} 10,000 years.

40|$|A {{recent review}} of {{woodland}} caribou {Rangifer tarandus caribou) status in Alberta {{estimated that there}} are between 3600 and 6700 caribou occupying 113 000 km 2 of habitat. There are two ecotypes of caribou in Alberta; the mountain ecotype in the west central region and the boreal ecotype primarily in the north. Mountain caribou populations are stable or declining and boreal populations, where data are available, appear to be stable or declining slowly.

50|$|Many unrecovered ancient votive offerings are {{threatened}} in today's world, especially those submerged in wetlands or other bodies of water. Wetlands and other aquatic sites often protect and preserve materials {{for thousands of}} years, because of their natural occurring anaerobic environments. However, many seabeds have been disturbed, rivers and streams have been stretched out or re-routed in the landscape, and many wetlands have been fully or partially drained or landfilled for various reasons in the last 100-200 years. Therefore, many remaining objects {{are in danger of}} oxidation and eventual rapid deterioration. The leading causes of the disturbances are dredging, bottom trawling fishing boats, agricultural activities, <b>peat</b> cutting, groundwater <b>extraction</b> by water wells and establishments of larger infrastructural facilities like expressways, water treatment plants, and in some instances, large-scale nature re-establishment projects.|$|R

40|$|This study {{involves}} {{the selection and}} use of suitable methods for measuring a) the rate of peat growth and b) the degree of humification of peat at Quick Moss, an area of blanket peat in the northern Pennines where the earliest peat is about 8, 000 years old. The stratigraphy of the peat section is examined systematically for a) variations in peat growth by adding tablets containing spores of Lycopodium clavatum to peat samples during routine pollen analysis and b) the degree of humification of the <b>peat</b> by chemical <b>extraction</b> and assay of the humic acids present in each sample. Two distinct regions are identified in the peat section and {{a change in the}} relationship between growth and humification is found to take place at the boundary between the two. The growth rate and degree of humification of the peat, and consequently the relationship between growth and humification at a specific level in the section, appear to have been principally controlled by the prevailing climate, through its effect on humidity and temperature at the bog surface at the time the peat forming plants were growing. The radiocarbon-dated pollen diagram indicates possible local Mesolithic activity, small scale Bronze Age deforestation and an extensive clearance beginning in pre-Roman times and continuing through and beyond the Roman period. A late expansion of alder, the transition from woodland to bog and a rather prolonged elm decline can be seen on the diagram...|$|R
40|$|An {{elevated}} valley-fill {{peat bog}} (Wilson Bog) near Mount Lofty, South Australia, failed in November 2005 following a flooding event, and exposed representative {{sections of the}} sediment infill. Two distinct units were revealed: 2 m of coarse-grained, siliciclastic sand/gravel, overlain by 2 m of <b>peat.</b> Asimple charcoal <b>extraction</b> technique based on floatation and skimming was developed to extract coarse charcoal from coarse-grained gravels to determine the palaeofire record at a proximal site of sedimentation. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of basal sediments revealed a minimum age of deposition of 7. 02 + 0. 50 – 0. 56 ka, while the oldest charcoal peak yielded a radiocarbon age of 6000 – 5740 cal. yr BP. The {{lower half of the}} siliciclastic unit contains three distinct charcoal peaks suggesting there were infrequent but intense fires associated with wetter conditions during the Holocene climatic optimum 8000 – 5000 years ago. The period from 4000 to 2000 cal. yr BP is characterised by more frequent charcoal peaks and higher background levels of charcoal, which is consistent withmore regular but less intense fires during drier, cooler conditions. The sharp transition from siliciclastic sedimentation to peat formation began ~ 1200 cal. yr BP, which may relate to a return to wetter conditions. However, fire frequency appears to have increased in this time suggesting augmentation by anthropogenic or ENSO-related factors. Charcoal-rich layers in the siliciclastic unit are associated with poorly sorted, bimodal sediments with high proportions of clay, silt and gravel, which supports the hypothesis that there is an association between past fire events and rapid, coarse-grained, post-fire aggradation. By analogy with active colluvial aggradation following recent fires at nearbyMount Bold, it is evident that fire plays a significant role in hillslope destabilization and subsequent sediment movement, leading to rapid valley- fill aggradation – a chain of events to which we apply the term ‘pyrocolluviation’.

40|$|Peatlands are {{carbon sinks}} and occupy {{approximately}} 13 % of Canada’s terrestrial surface of which 0. 02 % have been harvested for horticultural <b>peat.</b> The <b>extraction</b> of <b>peat</b> from natural peatlands alters the hydrology which affects {{the growth and}} survival of Sphagnum the primary peat forming vegetation. Ericaceous shrubs do not require specific water content and soil water pressure conditions for their existence and in cutover peatlands they occupy more than 70 % of the surface. Rainfall interception, transpiration and root water uptake and redistribution are processes that alter water availability at the soil surface. The high abundance of shrubs at cutover peatlands will influence the surface water balance and more importantly soil water availability and, inevitably determine the success of Sphagnum reestablishment at the site. This study seeks to understand the role that ericaceous shrubs play in the surface hydrological balance at a cutover site and how these changes impact Sphagnum development. Rainfall interception, transpiration, litter layer evaporation and soil water flux was investigated {{in the field and}} lab. Approximately 334 mm of rainfall was measured over the season. The shrub canopy and litter had a maximum storage capacity of 4 and 1. 2 mm respectively and intercepted ca. 36. 7 % (120 mm) of rainfall over the season. The effects of rainfall intensity and duration were more important than gross rainfall in determining the amount of water intercepted by the canopy, while the thickness and mass of the litter layer largely determined the storage capacity. Evapotranspiration from shrubs averaged 2. 5 mm day- 1 with a total of 211 mm over the season. Transpiration was 68 % (142 mm) of total evapotranspiration losses, and represented the greatest water loss from the shrub canopy. From these analyses only 22 % (72 mm) of rainfall is available for other soil processes and moss development. The evaporation under a litter cover is lower than bare peat and in the field represents water storage of 17 mm over the season. Reduced water input by litter interception is offset by the increased water storage under the litter. Laboratory analyses of soil water flux under ericaceous shrubs show that water loss under the shrubs was greater than bare peat. Water use under the shrubs was highest between - 10 and - 30 cm and was ca. 2 times greater than bare peat at the same levels. Volumetric water content (θ) decreased throughout the day and water use by shrubs during the day was twice that at night. The shrubs also maintained θ and soil water pressure (ψ) above the threshold values of 50 % and - 100 cm, respectively, needed for Sphagnum survival. Based on these analyses the shrubs will be beneficial to Sphagnum reestablishment and survival once the primary water losses have been compensated. I recommend raising the water table above - 20 cm. In peatland restoration activities, at this level, water used between - 10 and - 30 cm can quickly be recharged and surface moisture maintained above threshold by capillary rise helping to offset water loss by interception and transpiration through capillary rise...|$|R
5|$|The {{area was}} hit by severe floods in 1794, {{as a result of}} which the Commissioners of Sewers {{obtained}} the Brue Drainage Act in 1801, which allowed them to improve the course of the River Brue by the straightening of major loops at Highbridge and East Huntspill, and to construct the North and South Drains, which collected water from the peat moorlands and channelled it into the lower River Brue. Under the terms of the Act, two small canals, called Galton's Canal and Brown's Canal, were built near the North Drain to serve <b>peat</b> <b>extraction</b> workings. The drainage works were not wholly successful in preventing flooding, and the Commissioners often failed to obtain the levies they required to finance their operations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Peat</b> <b>extraction</b> is {{also seen}} by some conservationists as the main threat to mire {{biodiversity}} in Finland. The International Mire Conservation Group (IMCG) in 2006 urged the local and national governments of Finland to protect and conserve the remaining pristine peatland ecosystems. This includes the cessation of drainage and <b>peat</b> <b>extraction</b> in intact mire sites and the abandoning of current and planned groundwater extraction that may affect these sites.

25|$|The {{impact of}} {{disasters}} was {{to an extent}} increased through human activity. Relatively high-lying swampland was drained {{to be used as}} farmland. The drainage caused the fertile peat to contract and ground levels to drop, upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level, causing the underlying peat to contract further. Additionally, until the 19th century peat was mined, dried, and used for fuel, further exacerbating the problem. Centuries of extensive and poorly controlled <b>peat</b> <b>extraction</b> lowered an already low land surface by several metres. Even in flooded areas, <b>peat</b> <b>extraction</b> continued through turf dredging.|$|E

500|$|Environmentalists {{continued}} {{to campaign for}} recognition of the ecological value of the moors. In 2002 the government agreed to buy the <b>peat</b> <b>extraction</b> rights from The Scotts Company (now trading as The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company).

Scotts worked with English Nature to return worked areas to a condition where they could start to regenerate, until their involvement with this contract on Thorne Moors ended in March 2006. Since 2005, [...] of Thorne Moors have been designated as a National Nature Reserve.

500|$|Until the mid-twentieth century, all peat {{was cut by}} hand. Although {{the effects}} of the {{industry}} on the ecology of the moors were serious, hand cutting mainly affected the surface of the moors. It left behind trenches and ditches, which soon became waterlogged, and were re-colonised {{to become part of the}} diverse habitat. Once the cutting process was mechanised, peat could be cut from a greater depth, and at a faster rate, resulting in less ability for the moors to recover. Mechanical peat cutting was introduced to the moors in the early 1960s, and the process was similar to hand cutting, in that the peat was extracted over a small area but to a considerable depth. More destructive to the ultimate regeneration of the moors was the introduction of peat milling in 1985, where a thin layer of peat was stripped from a wider area. Thus in 1910, around 56 tonnes per acre were extracted from [...] of the moors, whereas in 1985 the yield was 10 tonnes per acre over double that area.

500|$|Although {{official}} attitudes did {{not place}} much {{value on the}} moors, William Bunting moved to Thorne after the Second World War and became an advocate for moor preservation. Thought to be rude and irascible, he began a campaign to recognise the ecological importance of the moors. He asserted that the enclosures of the 1800s, when common rights were replaced by private ownership, had been illegal, as was much of the commercial exploitation of his time. He {{seemed to have a}} good deal of evidence to support his claims, and took several major utilities to court over acts which he felt were illegal. He won a series of high-profile cases, which he used as publicity to advance the case for conserving the moors. In 1972, Bunting began direct action, aided by local residents, local naturalists, and students. During the week, the <b>peat</b> <b>extraction</b> company Fisons would cut drains {{to begin the process of}} lowering the water table. During the weekends, Bunting's Beavers, as his team became known, would walk onto the moors and construct dams across the new ditches, to retain the water levels. By the summer, the Beavers appeared to be winning the battle, and their activities were featured on BBC television. Fisons dynamited eighteen of the dams, but the activists were undeterred and began rebuilding them. Finally, Fisons conceded defeat, and negotiated with the Nature Conservancy Council on the future management of the moors in 1974. The government granted some [...] Site of Special Scientific Interest status in 1981. Although this had little immediate effect, it has contributed to subsequent appreciation of the area and its importance as an ecological resource.|$|E
