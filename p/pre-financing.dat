50|$|A set {{of papers}} {{on the role of}} {{contract}} farming in promoting inclusive market access, published by FAO in 2013, covers contractual arrangements in Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Honduras, South Africa, Tanzania and Thailand. The editors conclude that despite a preference for procurement from large farmers, factors other than farm size contribute to a company’s decision and that contract farming will not, therefore, necessarily lead to the exclusion of small farmers from supply chains. Geographical factors are important, both in terms of how they impact on production and in terms of factors such as land rights, gender and ethnic relationships. The editors identify a gradual convergence in clauses and conditions used in contracts and note that the two most common contract provisions, those involving technical assistance and <b>pre-financing</b> of inputs, may be essential for small farmer inclusion. The publication considers the role of third parties, such as NGOs, in coordinating farmers. The editors also identify potential roles for third parties in providing independent quality certification and in certifying contracting companies {{in order to reduce the}} risk for farmers.|$|E

We hypothesised that in order to improve the forest conservation by local inhabitants and to increase their revenue from the work with non-timber forest products (NTFPs), organisational, methodical as well as financial support is required. We concentrated on Brazil nuts as a profitable NTFP. After conducting field research of economic activities in two forest communities of Rond 4;nia, Brazil, we conducted three stages of longitudinal experimental research while applying the Fair Trade concept. We organised a team of Brazil nut harvesters, developed a harvesting strategy, provided <b>pre-financing</b> for the stock creation of Brazil nuts and created a sales plan. Analysis of these interventions suggested that through organisational support and <b>pre-financing,</b> Brazil nut harvesters were able to organise themselves to increase their income and manage new forest territories sustainably. We identified the relationship between external support continuity, size of <b>pre-financing</b> and number of participants, their income as well as the size of managed forest territory.

I partition firms according to their internal funds {{at the time of}} their financing activities and find that <b>pre-financing</b> price run-up is much stronger among firms with high internal funds at the time of financing, while post-financing stock underperformance is concentrated among firms with low internal funds at the time of ex-ternal financing. This new finding is different from the traditional association between <b>pre-financing</b> price run-up and post-financing stock underperformance. I also investigate how external financing affects incentives and long-term post-financing stock performance condi-tioned on the availability of internal funds. First, Post-financing stock underperformance is disproportionately large during earnings announcement periods. Furthermore, these firms experience less decrease in post-financing average selling, general, and administrative ex-penses due to economies of scale from expansion. Finally, related to their external financing activities, these firms have a weaker information environment represented by more opti-mistic analyst earnings forecasts, larger forecast dispersion, and lower analyst coverage. This empirical evidence is consistent with existence and underestimation of a moral hazard problem induced by conflicts between current shareholders and new claimholders when firms lack internal funds...|$|E

30|$|Infrastructure {{financing}} in Germany {{depends on}} the mode of transport. Apart from some <b>pre-financing</b> through Public-private-partnership models (for a critical assessment see [19]), the entire federal road infrastructure is financed through the state budget. The two sources for funding are tax revenues and the net revenues from the HGV user charge, the later being included into the state budget and earmarked for road infrastructure investment. Also inland waterways are entirely financed through the state budget with rather small revenues from user fees (the river Rhine {{as the most important}} waterway in Germany is exempted from user fees since 1868). With respect to rail infrastructure, DB Netz AG collects user fees and is not only responsible for operation and maintenance of the federal railway network but also contributes to the financing of investment projects. However, the largest share of infrastructure investment is financed through the federal state’s budget, sometimes complemented by funding from the European Union or the German states. Therefore, total investment into the railway infrastructure exceeds the values shown in the state budget and the infrastructure investment masterplans.|$|E

30|$|Low income {{countries}} may sometimes require external assistance to manage large scale disaster risks. An important challenge {{with this kind}} of risk management strategy is the time lag between a disaster and the arrival of donor funds and the required aid to save lives at risk (Linnerooth-Bayer et al. 2005). In widespread disaster situations, timing of interventions will have substantial impact on averting famine conditions as well as the ability of vulnerable households to withstand future shocks. In many cases, humanitarian assistance arrives late in the season and after people have already lost their most valuable assets such as livestock, or have a diminished health/nutritional status to a level that will undermine future recovery and resilience. In some cases, donor support may be limited either due to aid fatigue or the internal political conditions and insecurity in the affected country that may affect delivery of relief and development assistance. In such cases, the effectiveness of external assistance for disaster risk management is compromised. As an alternative strategy, international aid agencies have considered using weather index insurance instruments to <b>pre-finance</b> disaster relief services (Hess and Syroka 2005; World Bank 2005; Chantarat et al. 2007; Linnerooth-Bayer et al. 2005; Hazell and Hess 2010). For instance, in 2006, the World Food Program (WFP) purchased about US$ 1 million worth of weather index insurance premiums for Ethiopian farmers from the international re-insurer, Axa, with a maximum payout of US$ 7.1 million. Several other studies and pilot projects have also shown the relevance of weather index insurance for famine prevention and its effectiveness towards enhancing disaster risk management ability of low income countries (see Hess and Syroka 2005; World Bank 2005; Chantarat et al. 2007).|$|R

In contrast, Bulgaria’s fiscal position is expected to deteriorate by 1. 6 % of GDP on average in 2007 - 2009, if no expenditure restructuring of the fiscal framework is carried out. The expected deterioration of the public finances related to EU accession would be due to co-financing requirements, national contributions to the EU budget, and possible full <b>pre-financing</b> of the EU direct payments to Bulgarian farmers {{in the first year of}} accession.

North American Association of Fisheries Economists (NAAFE), Corvallis, 2017. A {{significant proportion of}} catch by artisanal fishers in Ghana is sold through wealthy middle-women, known as “fish mothers,” who often <b>pre-finance</b> fishing trips. This study examined the determinants of catch sales through fish mothers.   Data used came from artisanal fishermen at major coastal fishing communities in Ghana. The effects of select variables were examined with a Double Hurdle model assuming the fisherman’s marketing decision first relates {{to whether or not}} to sell to fish mothers, and secondly, what percentage of fish catch is sold to them. Self-financing of fishing trips was found to negatively impact fish sold to fish mothers. Artisanal fishermen were 19 % less likely to sell to fish mothers if they self-finance, and that self-financing will result in a 10 % downward change in the unconditional percentage fish sold to fish mothers. The impact of price, percentage of high value fish landed, boat size, number of fishing trips per year as well as fishing experience were found to positively impact the fishermen’s decision.   The estimated average partial effects suggested that boat size had the strongest effect on fish sold through the fish mothers, with about 146 % and 91 % change, respectively on conditional and unconditional sale of fish catch, which is likely caused by higher catches. Fishermen used a range of canoe (boat) sizes from 8 m to 27 m, with an average of 16. 4 m.

The study aims at identifying causes, effects and measures for minimising time overruns in road construction projects in Malawi. A detailed literature review and structured questionnaire surveys were used for the study; and results revealed the presence of time overruns in road construction projects in Malawi. Results of the study have revealed that inadequate planning, inability to <b>pre-finance</b> projects, delays in processing contractors’ payments, delayed mobilisation to project sites, slow decision making, delayed approvals for scope changes, workers risky behaviours, poor planning and scheduling, price fluctuations, political interference, equipment unavailability, inclement weather as causes of time overruns in projects. Time overruns in road {{projects have}} cost overruns, extension of time, claims, disputes, contract termination, loss of profits, project abandonment, poor quality of work due to hurried execution, idling of resources, bankruptcy, arbitration, litigation and loss of employees as their effects. The study has established the following measures which when effectively implemented will minimise time overruns in road construction projects: proper project planning and scheduling, effective and efficient management of sites and supervision services, availability of complete designs at project commencement, coordination on site, adherence to specification, use of appropriate construction methods; use of proper and modern equipment, conducting frequent progress meetings, construction according to drawings and use of up to date technology. As a way of mitigating time overruns in road construction projects in Malawi, the study recommends the following: ensuring secure and reliable funding for the entire project duration; availability of complete designs at project commencement; awarding contracts to technically and financially sound contractors; ensure availability by revamping activities of PVHO; implementation of measures which will counter the occurrence of time overruns in projects; and holding of frequent progress site meetings...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographyIn {{the third}} quarter of 2003, investors {{continued}} to favor riskier assets buoyed by abundant global liquidity, low interest rates in mature markets, strong economic growth (with low inflation), and improving credit quality. Credit spreads in emerging and Latin American markets narrowed in response, by 41 and 56 basis points, respectively, and are near historical lows in most emerging market countries. The EMBI+ index is well below its long run average, according to J. P Morgan. Issuers in emerging markets and Latin America benefited from the decline in spreads, {{as well as from the}} greater interest in their bonds by crossover investors. In the first three quarters of 2003 net emerging markets debt issuance, adjusted for bond buybacks, reached US$ 52. 6 billion, close to the 2002 total of US$ 54. 2 billion, according to Merrill Lynch. By region, Latin America had the largest share of total net issuance in the first three quarters of 2003 : 49 %. Many Latin American borrowers took advantage of strong investor demand to <b>pre-finance</b> borrowing targeted for 2004. Latin American bonds, which offered yields above those of Asia and Eastern Europe, accumulated the biggest gains in the first three quarters of the year, confirming the notion that investors have favored riskier assets and have searched for yield. Among Latin American bonds, those that offered the highest yields, such as Ecuador and Brazil, accumulated the highest gains. However, not only returns attracted investors to emerging debt markets in {{the third quarter}}. Fundamentals and improving credit quality were also a factor. Investors perceptions of the creditworthiness of emerging market issuers have improved in response to economic policy measures that countries have adopted to address high debt levels and boost reserves. Markets now perceive a much lower probability of default among emerging markets. The average 5 -year default probability implied by the spreads on a range of emerging market credit default swaps is about half that expected 12 months ago, according to the IMFs Financial Market Update. The decline has been driven mainly by the reduction in default probabilities on Latin American sovereign issuers. As a consequence, after a respite earlier in the year, a series of credit rating upgrades in the third quarter reinforced a long-term trend of credit rating improvement in emerging market...|$|R

Earthquake related disaster in Pakistan is a regular and serious threat to the community however the country lack tools for earthquake risk reduction through early warning (pre-earthquake planning), rapid response (prompt response to locations of high risk) and <b>pre-financing</b> earthquake related risk (property insurance against disaster). This paper present models for physical, social and economic loss estimation of structures in Pakistan for earthquake induced ground motions which are derived using state-of-the-art earthquake loss estimation methodologies. The loss estimation methodologies are being calibrated with the site-specific materials and structures response whereas the derived models are tested and validated against recent earthquakes in the region. The models can be used to develop damage scenario for earthquakes (estimate damaged and collapsed structures, casualties and homeless) and estimate economic losses for the required repair and reconstruction (for a single earthquake event and all possible earthquakes). The models can provide help on policy- and decision-making towards earthquake risk mitigation and disaster risk reduction in Pakistan...|$|E
30|$|The {{aim of the}} EU Structural Funds is to {{increase}} long-term sustainable growth of the lagging areas. However, soon after {{the outbreak of the}} crisis, the European Commission put forward a recovery plan in which it encouraged the use of EU Structural Funds for counter-cyclical aims (European Commission 2008 a, b). In particular, the Commission suggested increasing the spending through the combination of both EU funding and national budgetary stimulus packages, which should be coordinated in order to avoid negative spillovers across countries (European Commission 2008 a). With regard to money available for the cohesion policy, the recovery plan envisaged to accelerate program implementation rather than {{to increase}} funding per se. It translated into an ease of administrative procedures, an increase of projects <b>pre-financing</b> and a decrease of national co-funding share, allowing countries to increase up-front spending as the pressure on national budget constraints is reduced. The Commission encouraged member States to “re-prioritize” cohesion investments in view of the ongoing turbulent economic situation: it invited national governments “to explore possible changes in priorities and objectives with a view to accelerate the spending in the areas with more growth potential. This could include more focus on energy efficiency measures, including in housing, and strengthening the focus of support for small and medium enterprises, which are the main motor for growth in the European economy.” (European Commission 2008 b, pg. 4).|$|E
30|$|Several {{examples}} of weather index insurance reviewed provide {{examples of}} meso- and macro-level applications. Agencies involved in disaster risk management (e.g. governments, NGOs, WFP) could buy weather index insurance to cover vulnerable communities/regions or households {{with the objective}} of accessing timely funds to provide assistance before hunger and malnutrition sets in and forces households to sell their productive assets needed for long-term resilience and poverty reduction. Along the same lines, the potential of weather index insurance for famine prevention is widely recognized (Linnerooth-Bayer et al. 2005; World Bank 2011; ARC 2014 a). Chantarat et al. (2007) using data from Kenya show the positive benefit of linking weather index insurance contracts for famine prevention as it allows timely response to shocks and reduces humanitarian costs through the <b>pre-financing</b> ability of insurance. In some cases, vulnerable households may be able to pay the premiums through employment in public works and productive safety nets (as in the Ethiopia case). In other cases, governments and NGOs may be able to buy such insurance as famine prevention strategies without retailing to individual households. The recent initiative by African Union member states (African Rick Capacity) is an example of macro and regional risk pooling that may solve the challenges related to securing funds before disaster hits a given region or population (ARC 2014 a).|$|E

The May-June turbulence was the first test of the progress achieved by emerging market countries in strengthening economic fundamentals and reducing the burden of foreign debt. Emerging markets rebounded after volatility subsided, with stocks recovering much of their earlier losses and spreads tightening in July and August. In Latin American markets, spreads on dollar-denominated bonds widened by 40 basis points in May, according to the Latin component of J. P. Morgan's EMBI+ index, while the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) for Latin America, an indicator of stocks' performance, decreased by 14. 2 %. For the quarter as a whole, spreads widened by 20 basis points, and stock prices fell by 4. 1 %. New Latin American debt issuance amounted to only US$ 3. 5 billion in {{the second quarter}} of 2006, the lowest level since the last quarter of 2002, and a drastic reduction from the US$ 14. 7 billion issued in the first quarter. Corporate issuance surpassed sovereign issuance, accounting for 89 % of the total Latin American issuance in the second quarter. Given the extremely favorable global conditions, Latin American sovereign issuers had actively <b>pre-financed</b> future external obligations in 2005 and in the first quarter, making it possible to forgo new issuance in the second quarter, when market conditions became less favorable. Risk appetite has been an important factor in explaining investors' behavior in recent months. In the first quarter of 2006, global liquidity contributed not only to lower emerging market spreads, but also to lower high-yield spreads. In {{the second quarter of}} 2006, turbulence in financial markets contributed to widen spreads both in emerging and high-yield markets. While in the second half of 2005 the correlation between emerging and high-yield spreads turned negative, it turned positive again in the first half of 2006 (0. 7), as global conditions first benefited, and later adversely affected both asset classes. The May-June turbulence showed that financial markets now face a new reality of reduced liquidity and greater risk aversion. The slowdown in the U. S. economy has brought uncertainty to the global economic outlook, despite the good growth performance thus far this year in the Eurozone, in Japan and many emerging markets. The market is now facing a number of uncertainties, including the future direction of the U. S. Fed interest rate policy, as well as the pace and the degree of the U. S. economic slowdown, with geopolitical tensions adding to investors' uncertainty. The risk of a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances remains a concern...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographyEmerging market bond spreads {{tightened}} {{to record}} low levels in 2005, {{as a result}} of the search for yield in face of ample global liquidity and improving fundamentals in emerging market countries. According to J. P. Morgan, most of the EMBI Global's 8. 96 % total return in 2005 was derived from spread tightening, which totaled 110 basis points in 2005. The EMBI+ spreads tightened 111 basis points and its Latin component tightened 137 basis points in 2005. Emerging and Latin American markets were also supported by active debt management, as countries took advantage of the favorable external environment to pre-finance for 2006. Sovereigns in Latin America, which will face a heavy electoral cycle in 2006, are estimated to have already met more than 90 % of their 2006 external debt financing needs. <b>Pre-financing</b> and debt management has led to improved debt structures and increased resilience to external shocks in emerging markets. According to market analysts, however, some vulnerability remains in Latin American markets. The region remains vulnerable to fluctuations in commodity markets, because despite higher export prices, export volume growth has fallen behind the world's performance, implying a lower export share in global markets. Latin America's investment rate remains relatively low and continues to impose limits on the region's long-term growth. Finally, the 2006 electoral cycle will be a key development to watch, as it might be a source of uncertainty and increased volatility...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{practice}} of pre-finance, which is very often used by airports to fund major investments, such as runways and terminals. It involves the airport charging airlines higher prices as soon as, and sometimes before, the project 2 ̆ 7 s construction commences, often well before it becomes operational. Generally, airlines strongly oppose pre-finance. This paper assesses pre-finance {{in terms of a}} range of different impacts. It begins by determining which airports can make use of pre-finance- only those which have market power can do so. Allocative efficiency is enhanced by <b>pre-financing,</b> though the impact is smaller in the case of runways subject to slot controls than when facilities are congested. An important issue concerns the distributional impacts-is the airlines 2 ̆ 7 opposition to pre-finance well founded? It is shown that airlines actually lose by two mechanisms. One of these arises when different airlines and their passengers use the airport when the airport is investing and when it becomes operational. With the second, airlines lose and their customers actually gain, when slot controlled runways are pre-financed. How the airport is regulated has an impact on the incentives of the airport to pre-finance. In particular, price capped airports have an incentive to pre-finance, if allowed to by the regulator, but airports subject to light handed regulation do not seem to have strong incentives either way. The paper concludes by investigating two contrasting case studies...|$|E
