25|$|The Alburgh, Vermont – Rouses Point, New York rail trestle. From {{sometime}} in the late 19th century until 1964, this wooden trestle carried two railroads (the Rutland Railroad and the Central Vermont Railroad) over the lake {{just south of the}} US 2 vehicular bridge. The iron swing bridge at the center (over the navigation channel) has been removed. Most of the wooden pilings remain and can be seen looking south from the US 2 bridge. Part of the trestle on the Rouses <b>Point</b> <b>side</b> has been converted for use as an access pier associated with the local marina.|$|E
2500|$|Before the Port Authority {{obtained}} Blount Island, {{the island}} was named Goat Island. The Bartchlett family lived on the island for over 35 years. They were there during World War II. They observed ships coming through the channel still burning from action in the war. The Dames Point Cut that straightened the river was signed off by George Bartchlett allowing the dredging to begin. He raised seven children and four grandchildren on this island. At that time {{the only way to}} {{the island was}} by boat. The house once set on the Dames <b>Point</b> <b>side</b> of the island.

The mei is chiseled onto the tang on the side which traditionally faces away from the wearer's body while being worn; since the katana and wakizashi are always worn with the cutting-edge up, the edge should be held to the viewer's left. The inscription will be viewed as kanji {{on the surface of}} the tang: the first two kanji represent the province; the next pair is the smith; and the last, when present, is sometimes a variation of 'made by', or, 'respecfully'. The date will be inscribed near the mei, either with the reign name; the Zodiacal Method; or those calculated from the reign of the legendary Emperor Jimmu, dependent upon the period.|$|E
50|$|The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) {{initially}} {{thought that}} the beach sand was coming from an underwater glacial deposit. Thus when in 1866 they were called in to protect the navigable channel of the Saco river they built rock jettys on the {{both sides of the}} mouth of the Saco river to protect the channel from sand. The north jetty was extended in 1897, 1930 and 1938, and raised at various dates through 1969. The primary source of sediment for the beaches is the Saco river. Longshore drift is dominantly to the north along the shore. About 1960 another jetty was built on the south (Pine <b>Point)</b> <b>side</b> of the mouth of the Scarborough River to protect it from sand. It was not until 1992 that the USACOE acknowledged that there is no source of sand nourishment in the area. Thus, erosion is worst at Camp Ellis in Saco {{at the south end of}} the system where the Saco jetty prevents sand from coming ashore naturally while Pine Point is growing both from the sand coming out of the Saco river and from sand eroding from Camp Ellis and other parts of the bay to its south.|$|E
5000|$|When finally completed, the [...] chain {{contained}} huge iron links, each {{two feet}} in length and weighing 114 lb. The links were carted to New Windsor, where they were put together, and floated down the river to West Point on logs late in April. Including swivels, clevises, and anchors, the chain weighed 65 tons. For buoyancy, 40 ft logs were cut into 16 ft sections, waterproofed, and joined by fours into rafts fastened with 12 ft timbers. Short sections of chain (10 links, a swivel, and a clevis) were stapled across each raft and later, in the river, the chain sections were united. Peter Townsend, owner of Sterling Iron Works, was paid by the Continental Congress to manufacture the chain.Captain Thomas Machin, the Artillery Officer and engineer who had installed the chain at Fort Montgomery, {{was assigned to the}} same task at West Point. On 30 April 1778, he directed the installation of the chain across the river. Its southern end was secured to a small cove on the West Bank of the river and its northern end was anchored to Constitution Island. The West <b>Point</b> <b>side</b> was protected by Chain Battery and the Constitution Island side by Marine Battery. Both ends were anchored to log cribs filled with rocks.|$|E

The St. Johns River between Jacksonville and the Atlantic Ocean twists and turns. That was not a problem until shipping companies began using bigger and bigger freighters after World War II. The United States Army Corps of Engineers created the Dames Point Cut, a straight channel that provided an alternative to the river's natural course, which contained several of the sharpest turns in the river. Four marsh islands received the dredging spoil and became Blount Island. The property was turned over to the Jacksonville Port Authority (JAXPORT) for development. The west side of the island was developed and used for freight operations after the Jacksonville Port Authority (JAXPORT) was established in 1963. Railroad access to the site was added in the late 1960s.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of {{the course of a}} road accident where a motorcycle hit the side of a passenger car has been presented. The scope of the analysis was limited to the post-impact motorcycle movement at the initial stage of contact with the car. At this stage, the most important forms of this movement include rotation of the motorcycle around a variably located instantaneous centre and lifting of the rear end of the motorcycle. Based on an analysis (frame-by-frame) of the video record of the experiment and the acceleration values measured on the motorcycle frame, the parameters of motorcycle motion were determined for specific time instants. The trajectories of noteworthy motorcycle points after the motorcycle impact against the car have been shown. The parameters of motorcycle motion as determined from the experiment may provide a good basis for the road accident reconstruction process and for the {{analysis of}} the course of generation of injuries to motorcyclist's body. The course of the process of motorcycle rotation and lifting has crucial influence on the movement of motorcyclist's body and especially on the point of impact of motorcyclist's head against the car. The location of this <b>point</b> (<b>side</b> window, roof edge, roof panel) is critical for the type of the head injuries resulting from the accident. Dominika Trębac...|$|E
