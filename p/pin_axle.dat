50|$|The <b>pin</b> <b>axle</b> {{provides}} a cylindrical bar {{from which the}} blades can rotate. It is made of stainless steel, which will not rust in areas that have been worn by contact with other metals. The process to create such a <b>pin</b> <b>axle</b> is quite intensive and hence it is bought off-the-shelf from a supplier. They are made by a specialised machine which cuts thick wire into a suitable length and then die punches {{the head of the}} pin. The supplier normally runs specialised machinery that is capable of producing large amounts of products at a high rate for a low cost.|$|E
50|$|The current Opinel knife {{consists}} of a blade, wooden handle, stainless steel metal clamping band, stainless pivot <b>pin</b> (<b>axle),</b> and (except {{in the case of}} the smaller models) a stainless steel Virobloc locking collar, which locks the blade open or closed.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{often used}} as a heavy duty {{demolition}} tool, the thermic lance {{can also be used}} to remove seized axles of heavy machinery without damaging the bearings or axle housing. This technique is most often used on the <b>pins</b> and <b>axles</b> of large equipment such as cranes, ships, bridges and sluice-gates.|$|R
40|$|Even {{when all}} the details are provided, the design of wind {{turbines}} is a big challenge. The detailed knowledge of the deformation of vital wind turbine components caused by a wind with extreme operating gusts and other type of winds can be obtained only by performing measurements on the wind turbine. The vital component of the wind turbine is <b>axle</b> <b>pin.</b> This article {{presents the results of}} the measured changes in wind speed at the height at which strains were measured. The measured strains are used for calculating the stress. It is also shown that {{on the basis of the}} calculations on the wind model obtained with the GH Bladed software, the input data are obtained for the SolidWorks software, by which stress on the <b>axle</b> <b>pin</b> can be calculated. The final confirmation of the proper approach and the calculation is achieved by comparison between the calculated and the measured strains on the <b>axle</b> <b>pin</b> during exploitation of a wind turbine of nominal power output of 1 MW...|$|R
6000|$|There was a {{consultation}} and {{an examination of}} the wheel, but the whole tonga was rotten, and the axle was smashed and the <b>axle</b> <b>pins</b> were bent and nearly red-hot. [...] "It is nothing," [...] said the driver, [...] "the mail often does this. What is a wheel?" [...] He took a big stone and began hammering proudly on the tire, to show that that at least was sound. A hasty court-martial revealed that there was absolutely not one single relief vehicle on the whole road between Chitor and Udaipur.|$|R
50|$|An {{odometer}} {{for measuring}} distance was first described by Vitruvius around 27 and 23 BC, although the actual inventor {{may have been}} Archimedes of Syracuse (c. 287 BC - c. 212 BC). It was based on chariot wheels turning 400 times in one Roman mile. For each revolution a <b>pin</b> on the <b>axle</b> engaged a 400 tooth cogwheel, thus turning it one complete revolution per mile. This engaged another gear with holes along the circumference, where pebbles (calculus) were located, that were to drop one by one into a box. The distance traveled would thus be given simply by {{counting the number of}} pebbles.|$|R
5000|$|The Theravada school {{teaches that}} there is no {{universal}} personal god. The world as we know it does not have its origin in a primordial being such as Brahman or the Abrahamic God. What we see is only a product of transitory factors of existence, which depend functionally upon each other. The Buddha is said to have said: [...] "The world exists because of causal actions, all things are produced by causal actions and all beings are governed and bound by causal actions. They are fixed like the rolling wheel of a cart, fixed by the <b>pin</b> of its <b>axle</b> shaft." [...] (Sutta-Nipata 654) ...|$|R
2500|$|Interchange with {{standard}} gauge railroads became a problem during the 1860s. [...] Grand Trunk equipped approximately 1,000 freight cars with experimental [...] "sliding-wheels" [...] in 1863 at company shops in Sarnia, Ontario, and Pointe-Saint-Charles in Montreal. Gauge could be adjusted by removing and inserting <b>axle</b> <b>pins</b> on special tapered-gauge track segments at interchange points. Safety problems were reported despite high maintenance costs. All lines west of Montreal {{were converted to}} standard gauge on October 3 and 4, 1873. Grand Trunk purchased 200 standard gauge locomotives (including 62 from Portland Company) and converted 135 old locomotives. Ten thousand standard gauge bogies were purchased for conversion of freight cars. The railway from Portland to Montreal was standard-gauged in September, 1874.|$|R
5000|$|The harp {{mechanism}} was {{a simple}} lever which pivoted on an <b>axle</b> <b>pin</b> located midway up the main body (the [...] "frame") of the stand. The {{upper part of the}} lever passed through a slot atop the stand. A signal target was usually attached {{at the top of the}} lever. The lower end of the lever extended below the main body of the stand where it attached to a bar. Pulling on the lever would pull this bar which in turn would move the rail into the desired position. The lever was sometimes secured by notches along the slot at the top of the stand. [...] Variations of this basic design were common.|$|R

25|$|The {{body and}} pin meet at either a spring or hinge. The {{earliest}} design is the spring which provides tension to the pin. The spring could be unilateral or bilateral. A unilateral spring winds around {{in one direction}} only. Unilateral springs are the earliest type, first appearing around the 14th century BC. Bilateral springs that wind around to {{both sides of the}} fibula body, appeared around the 6th century BC. Bilateral springs can be very short, with only one or two revolutions per side, or up to 10cm long. Most bilateral springs are made of one piece of metal and therefore have a spring cord, a piece of wire extending {{from one end of the}} spring to the other. The spring cord can pass in front of or behind the fibulae body. Bilateral springs wrap around a <b>pin</b> or <b>axle.</b> These are usually made of iron even if the rest of the fibula and spring is copper alloy. In the 1st century AD some fibulae had springs that were concealed under a metal cover that was an extension of the fibula body. These are known as covered springs, or hidden springs.|$|R
40|$|A bicycle {{wheel is}} rolled down an incline on a thin axle, {{as shown in}} Figure 1. It can be rolled in either of two conditions- (a) with its axle free to rotate on its {{bearings}} {{at the center of}} the wheel, or (b) with the wheel <b>pinned</b> to the <b>axle</b> so the wheel and axle system rotate together. In case (a), the initial gravitational potential energy lost by the wheel is converted into translational kinetic energy, and the wheel rolls rapidly down the incline. In case (b), the lost gravitational potential energy is converted into both rotational kinetic energy and translational kinetic energy. Because the wheel is weighted along its rim, it moves down the incline much more slowly in case (b) ...|$|R
50|$|In general, all {{railroad}} vehicles have spring suspension; without springs, {{irregularities in}} the track could lift wheels off {{the rail and}} cause impact damage to both rails and vehicles. Driving wheels are typically mounted so that they have around 1 inch (2.5 cm) of vertical motion. When there are only 2 coupled axles, this range of motion places only slight stress on the crank <b>pins.</b> With more <b>axles,</b> however, provision {{must be made to}} allow each axle to move vertically independently of the others without bending the rods. This may be done by hinging the side rod at each intermediate crank pin, either using the pin itself as a hinge pin, or adding a hinge joint adjacent to the pin, as shown in the illustration.|$|R
60|$|All I know is {{that people}} have got the word Relativity into their heads, and catch-words always refer to some latent idea or {{conception}} in the popular mind. It has taken a Jew to knock the last center-pin out of our ideally spinning universe. The Jewish intelligence for centuries has been picking holes in our ideal system--scientific and sociological. Very good thing for us. Now Mr. Einstein, we are glad to say, has pulled out the very <b>axle</b> <b>pin.</b> At least {{that is how the}} vulgar mind understands it. The equation formula doesn't count.--So now, the universe, according to the popular mind, can wobble about without being pinned down.--Really, an anarchical conclusion. But the Jewish mind insidiously drives us to anarchical conclusions. We are glad to be driven from false, automatic fixities, anyhow. And once we are driven right on to nihilism we may find a way through.|$|R
5000|$|The {{odometer}} of Vitruvius {{was based}} on chariot wheels of 4 feet (1.2 m) diameter turning 400 times in one Roman mile (about 1400 m). For each revolution a <b>pin</b> on the <b>axle</b> engaged a 400 tooth cogwheel thus turning it one complete revolution per mile. This engaged another gear with holes along the circumference, where pebbles (calculus) were located, that were to drop one by one into a box. The distance traveled would thus be given simply by {{counting the number of}} pebbles. [...] Whether this instrument was ever built at the time is disputed. Leonardo da Vinci later tried to build it himself according to the description, but failed. However, in 1981 engineer Andre Sleeswyk built his own replica, replacing the square-toothed gear designs of da Vinci with the triangular, pointed teeth found in the Antikythera mechanism. With this modification, the Vitruvius odometer functioned perfectly.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. 50 CrV 4 {{spring steel}} is a tough, shock resisting, shallow {{hardening}} chromium vanadium steel having high fatigue and impact {{resistance in the}} heat treated condition. It is used extensively in gears, pinions, springs, shafts, <b>axles,</b> <b>pins,</b> bolts, etc., which require high modulus of resilience. The alloy was realised through conventional melt route of electric arc furnace (EAF) followed by ESR. The application of the alloy {{is limited to a}} section thickness of 15 mm [1]. Hence obtaining optimum mechanical properties becomes a challenging task. In this study, the hardening as well as tempering operations were limited to 15 mm thickness. The samples from the alloy were subjected to hardening at 860 °C for 1. 25 h. and oil quenching to room temperature followed by tempering at four different temperatures of 250, 300, 370 & 450 °C for 3 h. each with oil quenching to room temperature. It was found that the alloy exhibited good combination of strength and ductility when tempered at 450 °C. Microstructural study revealed the presence of fine tempered lath martensite along with the presence of a very small amount of delta ferrite along prior austenitic grain boundaries. The AFNOR 50 CrV 4 / AISI- 6150 steel is widely used in the manufacturing of valve springs...|$|R
40|$|The acquirements and {{potentiality}} {{universe of}} cleaning, heating and/or sputtering effects caused by plasma species bombardment phenomenon {{on the surface}} characteristics and finishing of manufactured parts treated in DC abnormal glow discharge opens a new research and development field, called here of Plasma Assisted Parts' Manufacturing (PAP'M). The adequate control of the sputtering mechanism allows the obtainment {{of different kinds of}} surface. Therefore, the design of rough or smooth surface, presenting a modified distribution of surface porosity and texturing could be idealized, in accordance with the desired surface characteristics, as the parts are simultaneously sintered and treated. This is the second part (out of two) of the work performed in hollow cathode discharge (HCD) and it presents the first results of the surface morphology's changes in the pressed iron samples and in the internal surface of the external cathode {{as a function of the}} inter-cathode distance and gas pressure. Potential applications include small diameters' cylindrical parts and components like <b>axles,</b> <b>pins,</b> pivots, and tubes and pipes presenting small internal diameters. Sputtering effects were quantified by means of mass loss, and Ra and Rz roughness measurements and qualified by means of SEM. Results indicate the sputtering mechanism is highly dependent of the hollow cathode effect, in HCD sintering and surface texturing treatments, comprising an important contribution to the development of green technologies for surface texturing, surface engineering, and part's manufacturing...|$|R
25|$|Another myth of {{the origin}} of the games is the story of Pelops, a local Olympian hero. The story of Pelops begins with Oenomaus, the king of Pisa, Greece, who had a {{beautiful}} daughter named Hippodamia. According to an oracle, the king would be killed by her husband. Therefore, he decreed that any young man who wanted to marry his daughter was required to drive away with her in his chariot, and Oenomaus would follow in another chariot, and spear the suitor if he caught up with them. Now, the king's chariot horses were a present from the god Poseidon and were therefore supernaturally fast. Pelops was a very handsome young man and the king's daughter fell in love with him. Before the race, she persuaded her father's charioteer Myrtilus to replace the bronze <b>axle</b> <b>pins</b> of the king's chariot with wax ones. Naturally, during the race, the wax melted and the king fell from his chariot and was killed. At the same time, the king's palace was struck by lightning and reduced to ashes, save for one wooden pillar that was revered in the Altis for centuries, and stood near what was to be the site of the temple of Zeus. Pelops was proclaimed the winner and married Hippodamia. After his victory, Pelops organized chariot races as thanksgiving to the gods and as funeral games in honor of King Oenomaus, in order to be purified of his death. It was from this funeral race held at Olympia that the beginnings of the Olympic Games were inspired. Pelops became a great king, a local hero, and he gave his name to the Peloponnese.|$|R
