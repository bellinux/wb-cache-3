40|$|Soldering of {{molded case}} {{tantalum}} capacitors {{can result in}} damage to Ta 205 dielectric and first turn-on failures due to thermo-mechanical stresses caused by CTE mismatch between materials used in the capacitors. It is also known that presence of moisture might cause damage to plastic cases due to the pop-corning effect. However, there are only scarce literature data {{on the effect of}} moisture content on the probability of post-soldering electrical failures. In this work, that is based on a case history, different groups of similar types of CWR tantalum capacitors from two lots were prepared for soldering by bake, moisture saturation, and longterm storage at room conditions. Results of the testing showed that both factors: initial quality of the lot, and preconditioning affect the probability of failures. Baking before soldering was shown to be effective to prevent failures even in lots susceptible to pop-corning damage. Mechanism of failures is discussed and recommendations for <b>pre-soldering</b> bake are suggested based on analysis of moisture characteristics of materials used in the capacitors' design...|$|E

40|$|Équipe 401 : Nanomatériaux pour la vie et développement durableInternational audienceThe {{metallic}} frameworks strengthening prostheses {{are composed}} of successive alloys joined {{to one another and}} the temperature melting range of which needs to be known to well operate the foundry operation as well as the two types of soldering usually realized. In this work eight parent alloys, four <b>pre-solder</b> alloys and four post-solder alloys were subjected to differential thermal analysis in order to know the real solidus and liquidus temperatures. Some of the alloys obviously solidify in one time (the single –phased alloys and the alloys containing a major phase) and other in two times (the bi-phased alloys with similar fractions for the two constituents). In all cases the temperatures of fusion’s start and end, and the temperatures of solidification’s start and end, were successfully determined. This led to several refractoriness classes (post-solder < <b>pre-solder</b> < parent alloys), an order in good agreement with the conditions of soldering needed all along the prosthesis fabrication. A simple criterion based on the separation of the contents in elements more refractory than the base element and the contents in elements less refractory than the base element, has been established for the prevision of the solidus temperatures and of the liquidus temperatures of the alloys based on gold and containing, with not too far contents, the same elements as the alloys studied in this work...|$|R

New metal sticker ID badges replaced those {{on the front of}} the Apple IIe, rebranding the machine. Retained were the upper half of the IIe case, the keyboard, speaker, and power supply. Original IIGS motherboards (those produced between 1986 and mid-1989) have electrical connections for the IIe power supply and keyboard present, although only about half produced have the physical plug connectors factory <b>pre-soldered</b> in.|$|R
