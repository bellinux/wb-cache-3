50|$|<b>Pentoxyverine</b> (rINN) or carbetapentane is an {{antitussive}} (cough suppressant) {{commonly used}} for cough associated with illnesses like common cold. It is sold over-the-counter in the United States as Solotuss, {{or in combination}} with other medications, especially decongestants. One such product is Certuss, a combination of guaifenesin and <b>pentoxyverine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Pentoxyverine</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in persons}} with bronchial asthma or {{other kinds of}} respiratory insufficiency (breathing difficulties), as well as angle-closure glaucoma. No data are available {{for the use of}} <b>pentoxyverine</b> during pregnancy, lactation, or children under two years of age, wherefore the drug must not be used under these circumstances.|$|E
50|$|Overdosage {{leads to}} drowsiness, agitation, nausea and {{anticholinergic}} effects like tachycardia (high heart rate), dry mouth, blurred vision, glaucoma, or urinary retention. Especially in children, <b>pentoxyverine</b> can cause hypoventilation, {{but much more}} seldom than codeine and other opioid antitussives.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pentoxyverine</b> dihydrogen citrate, {{the salt}} that is {{commonly}} used for oral preparations, is a white to off-white, crystalline powder. It dissolves easily in water or chloroform, but not in benzene, diethyl ether, or petroleum ether. It melts at 90 to 95 C. Other orally available salts are the hydrochloride and the tannate; suppositories contain the free base.|$|E
50|$|No {{interactions}} {{have been}} described at usual doses. It is possible that <b>pentoxyverine</b> can increase the potency of sedative drugs like benzodiazepines, some anticonvulsants and antidepressants, and alcohol. Likewise, some consumer informations warn patients from taking the drug in combination with or up to two weeks after monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which are known to cause potentially fatal reactions {{in combination with the}} (chemically only distantly related) antitussive dextromethorphan.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pentoxyverine</b> {{suppresses}} {{the cough}} reflex {{in the central}} nervous system, but the exact mechanism of action is not known with certainty. The drug acts as an [...] antagonist at muscarinic receptors (subtype [...] M1) and as an agonist at sigma receptors (subtype σ1). Its anticholinergic properties can theoretically relax the pulmonary alveoli and reduce phlegm production. Spasmolytic and local anaesthetic properties have also been described. The clinical relevance of these mechanisms is uncertain.|$|E
50|$|The {{substance}} is absorbed quickly from the gut and reaches its maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) after about two hours. If applied rectally, Cmax is reached after four hours. The bioavailability of the suppositories, measured as area under the curve (AUC), is about twofold that of oral formulations, {{due to a}} first pass effect of over 50%. By far the most important metabolisation reaction is ester hydrolysis, which accounts for 26.3% of the total clearance through the kidneys. Only 0.37% are cleared in form of the original substance. The plasma half life is 2.3 hours for oral formulations and three to 3.5 hours for suppositories. <b>Pentoxyverine</b> is also excreted into the breast milk.|$|E
40|$|A simple liquid chromatographic {{method for}} {{quantification}} of <b>pentoxyverine</b> in cough preparations is described. The LCseparation {{of the drug}} from the complex matrices of the dosage formulations was undertaken on a reversed phase 100 RP- 18 Lichrosphere (5 mm) column, 15 cm 4. 6 mm i. d. The mobile phase used was methanol and 25 % w/w ammonia in the ratio 99. 2 : 0. 8, v/v isocratically at a flow rate of 1. 2 mL min- 1 with U. V. detection at 258 nm, at ambient temperature.

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, anti-congestion drugs Ambroxol and Bromhexine, and anti-cough drugs Clobutinol, Butamyrate and <b>Pentoxyverine</b> were studied and {{determined}} {{with the use}} of HPLC-reverse-phase. Initially, the chromatographic behaviour of each was determined in relation to certain parameters which change chromatographic conditions and influence duration of analysis, separation capability of determinated systems and measurement sensitivity. Specifically, the effect of polarity on the retention time of the solvent was studied. For mobile phase preparation, selected solvents were methanol and acetonitrile which were prepared in aqueous solution of various concentrations. It was observed that increased concentrations of mobile phase in organic solvents with little polarity resulted in increased solubility of the said mobile phase and, consequently a reduction in the required time for analysis of the analytes. Improvement in time required for analysis of these drugs and symmetry of chromatographic peaks was accomplished after exploring effects various salts (added in aqueous form) had on each mobile phase. Especially trialed were various types of regulating aqueous solutions of base salts CH 3 COONH 4, CH 3 COONa, CH 3 COOK and CH 3 COOMg, from which CH 3 COONH 4 was selected as being most suitable for the cases of anti-congestion drugs Ambroxol and Bromhexine. The latter improved chromatographic peak symmetry and quite perceptively reduced the retention time of the analytes in question. For anti-cough Clobutinol, Butamyrate and <b>Pentoxyverine,</b> mobile liquid phases were studied which contained CH 3 COONH 4, tetraethylammonium hydrogen sulphate or tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulphate. It became evident that retention time co-efficients of anti-cough pharmaceuticals are influenced to a great degree by the concentration and the type of salt. It was observed that additions in mobile phase of smaller size ions such {{as in the case of}} tetraethylammonium hydrogen sulphate and tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulphate had as a result k’ co-efficient reductions, evidently due to its smaller ion solvency compared to that of the tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulphate ions. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe study {{describes}} the development, validation {{and application of}} a simple and reliable HPLC-DAD procedure for the stability-indicating determination of the cough suppressant drug <b>pentoxyverine</b> citrate (PTV). The method involved the use of Waters Symmetry C 8 (3. 9 × 150 mm, 5 μm) column with gradient elution of the mobile phase composed of 0. 025 M phosphoric acid and acetonitrile. The gradient elution started with 10 % (by volume) acetonitrile, ramped up linearly to 60 % in 10 min then it was kept constant {{till the end of}} the run. The mobile phase was pumped at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The multiple wavelength detector was set at 210 nm, and quantification of the analyte was based on measuring its peak area. Retention time for PTV was about 7. 03 min. Reliability and analytical performance of the proposed HPLC method was validated with respect to linearity, range, precision, accuracy, specificity, robustness, detection and quantification limits. Calibration curve of PTV was linear in the range 10 – 150 μg/mL with correlation coefficient > 0. 9998. The drug was subjected to forced-degradation conditions of hydrolysis, oxidation and dry heat. The proposed method proved to be specific and stability-indicating by resolution of the drug from its forced-degradation products. The validated HPLC method was applied to the analysis of PTV in syrup form where it was successfully resolved from the pharmaceutical additives and quantified with recoveries not less than 97. 7 %. Moreover, the proposed method was utilized to investigate the kinetics of acidic and basic hydrolysis of PTV, and to derive its pH-rate of degradation profile in Britton–Robinson buffer within the pH range 2 – 12. Finally, the proposed method made use of DAD as a tool for peak identity and purity confirmation...|$|E
