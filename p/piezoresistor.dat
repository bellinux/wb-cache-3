40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} simulation of a SiO 2 microbridge which measures the differential surface stress induced by the adsorption of molecules. Materials with smaller Young's modulus would be appropriate to measure the small variation of surface stress on the microbridge and therefore SiO 2 is chosen as the material for microbridge. The SiO 2 microbridge could be a potential application for the glucose detection if the enzyme glucose oxidase was immobilized on a top surface. The microbridge can be constructed on Silicon on insulator (SOI) substrate using the bulk micromachining technology.

30|$|Even though metal piezoresistor-based SU- 8 {{cantilevers}} {{are used}} as an alternative for solid-state semiconductor-based design, they suffer from a few limitations. It is preferred to design cantilevers with high value of nominal resistance of the <b>piezoresistor</b> primarily to reduce the magnitude of current and therefore the resulting Joule heating. However, it may be noted that due to very low resistivity of metals, the maximum value of nominal resistance of metal piezoresistors cannot be increased beyond a certain limit. Thus, when biased with a dc source compared to other piezoresistive materials, metal piezoresistors carry large volumetric current that results in significant Joule heating. The Joule heating of the metal <b>piezoresistor</b> combined with lower thermal conductivity of SU- 8 polymer matrix results {{not only in the}} difference in TCE-induced cantilever deflection, but also in an increase in Johnson noise floor and plastic deformation of the cantilever. Increasing the <b>piezoresistor</b> length is an option to increase the nominal resistance value. However, this adversely affects the electrical sensitivity of the device as a major portion of the resistor may be placed on the unstressed region of the cantilever. Other option is to design serpentine-shaped metal piezoresistors and biasing it with low dc voltage. Apart from the aforementioned factors, electro-migration is also closely related to the high magnitude of current density and, more importantly, the miniaturized size of the <b>piezoresistor</b> leading to instability in its resistance value [87].

30|$|<b>Piezoresistor</b> {{geometry}} {{is chosen}} {{based on the}} desired nominal resistance value and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Lower limit of nominal resistance is determined by joule heating-induced self-heating effects and electro-migration, whereas its upper limit is determined by specifications of driving current and interface circuitry. Thus, typically the value of nominal resistance of piezoresistors is kept in kΩ range. In general, the piezoresistors {{are designed to be}} U-shaped to improve reliability by avoiding interconnects on the cantilever platform. Since the electrical resistivity of metals is low (in the range of µ Ω-cm), when metal piezoresistors are designed in U shape, their nominal resistance is only a few ohms, which results in large joule heating. Thus, strategically the metal piezoresistors are designed lengthier to obtain large nominal resistance. Therefore, in few cases, rather than the conventional U-shaped design, the piezoresistors are meander-shaped. However, the coverage of the <b>piezoresistor</b> is limited by the cantilever lateral dimensions, since lengthier cantilever platforms result in reduced mechanical stability and electrical sensitivity. On the other hand, by tailoring the electrical resistivity of the <b>piezoresistor</b> material and careful design, it is possible to realize U-shaped metal piezoresistors. Similarly, the width and thickness of the <b>piezoresistor</b> are designed to obtain a desirable nominal resistance. Thickness of metal piezoresistors has an additional constraint on noise figure, since thinner metal piezoresistors show higher electrical noise level. The need for high nominal resistance value to reduce the current density and therefore the joule heating effects is achieved by using lower supply voltages. In the case of doped polysilicon or doped SU- 8 piezoresistors, the electrical resistivity is controlled by varying the dopant concentration. Thus, by optimizing the dopant concentration and geometry of the <b>piezoresistor,</b> desired nominal resistance is achieved. Typical magnitude of surface stress sensitivity and deflection sensitivity of SU- 8 piezoresistive cantilever sensors are in the range of a few ×  10 − 3 (N/m)− 1 and a few ×  10 − 6 to ×  10 − 9 (nm)− 1 which can detect miniscule forces of pN magnitude and lower.|$|E
