500|$|Congress {{eventually}} {{passed a}} watered-down {{version of the}} original plan put forward by Bedell and Senator Pete Domenici. The compromise version enacted a tax on the gasoline barges used {{and put it into}} a [...] "trust" [...] for waterway projects. While other supporters of waterway usage fees, including Domenici, backed the compromise, Bedell gave a <b>passioned</b> plea for his colleagues to oppose it. He viewed it as lacking a crucial element of the original plan - that of capital recovery. The trust was optional, and the Government could spend money on waterway projects irrespective of the trust. The compromise was eventually signed by Jimmy Carter. Bedell's original plan never made it through the House of Representatives, but he continued to introduce it in succeeding sessions. It would not, however, get a floor vote in succeeding sessions.|$|E

Not, indeed, if they do not desire to know the truth, or blind themselves to it that they may please themselves with passion; for then they are no longer pure: but if, continually seeking and accepting the truth as far as it is discernible, they trust their Maker for the integrity of the instincts He has gifted them with, and rest {{in the sense of a}} higher truth which they cannot demonstrate, I think they will be most in the right, so.|$|E

In the 1560 edition, each line of the psalm appears beside its corresponding poem. This version of the psalm was probably translated by Locke.|$|E

40|$|By September 1463 it {{was clear}} that Pope Pius II had managed to create the basis for a crusade {{alliance}} between Hungary, Venice, Burgundy, and the Papacy. Before proceeding to the final negotiations, it was necessary for him to obtain the consent to the crusade of the College Cardinals: in his coronation oath he had promised to make the crusade against the Turks his highest priority and to act in this matter only with the approval {{of the majority of the}} cardinals. On 23 September the pope summoned the cardinals to a secret consistory where he delivered the oration Sextus agitur annus. In this oration the pope gave a well-reasoned account of his wars in Italy and their necessity, a lucid analysis of the Church hierarchy's lack of credibility, and a <b>passioned</b> plea for a return to the ways of the Early Church and to the faith of its martyrs and confessors. He also detailed his strategy for mobilizing the crusade, and announced his provisions for the government of Rome in his absence...|$|E
40|$|In 1560, Anne Lok {{published}} {{a translation of}} four of Calvin's sermons on Isaiah 38, prefaced by a dedicatory epistle to Catherine Brandon and followed by a sonnet sequence in two parts - five sonnets 'expressing the <b>passioned</b> minde of the penitent sinner', followed by a longer sequence paraphrasing the 51 st psalm. It is an unsettling text {{in a number of}} ways. Generically anomalous, it contains the first sonnet sequence not only to be written in English, but to combine the Petrarchan genre of the sonnet sequence with that of psalm paraphrase. Compiled by a middle-class woman from the community of Protestant exiles in Geneva, it emerges from beyond the English court, in contrast to the texts of aristocratic women surrounding Catherine Parr which form the major precedent for women's publication in England before 1560. The text's strangeness disturbs the practice which underpins criticism on early modern women's writing of this period: characterizing women's textual activity in terms of a restricted class of aristocratic authors, in a secondary or derivative relationship to male-authored texts, and confined to religious genres and topoi. Lok's text draws upon largely male-authored French Calvinist and Anglo-Genevan traditions of psalm paraphrase to construct a text in which textual virtuosity works to out-trope the sonnets and psalm paraphrases of Thomas Wyatt, Lok's main poetic predecessor in England...|$|E
40|$|The {{critics of}} Charles Peguy have often {{noted in his}} {{writings}} the influence of Blaise Pascal. This influence, however, has been only alluded to and never studied in detail. This thesis proposed then to measure exactly {{the nature of the}} influence, to define it, and to see precisely in what context one must consider it. This entails, primarily, a close reading of the works of Peguy to discover just how similar to Pascal's his ideas might be, then a retracing of the source of those ideas which resemble Pascal's to find if they actually derive from those of the seventeenth century author. The reader of Peguy and Pascal must notice immediately the remarkable similarity in their thoughts and expression, and Peguy often admits that this similarity is due to a precise influence of Pascal. This is not true, however, in all cases where critics have alluded to an influence. There is often only an affinity or coincidence. The most important lesson learned by Peguy in his reading of Pascal is that of the misery and greatness in the human condition, like Pascal, Peguy leaned most on the pessimistic side of the dialectic: he is most like Pascal in his stress of the misery which he believed necessary for any religious conversion. Peguy also owes to Pascal the revelation that there are orders in reality, in states of mind, in modes of knowledge, or in political bodies which cannot be reduced to one another. Pascal’s ideas of "diversion”, of the bet, of the insertion of the eternal in the temporal, among others, show up again in the writings of Peguy. Other comparisons made by the critics are often artificial. It is true that Peguy's famous dialectic between the mystical and the political can be used to explain Pascal's position in the Provinciales against what he calls the "politics" of the Jesuits. But it is not to be supposed that in the Provinciales lies the source of Peguy's concept. Where critics have inferred an influence, they should have often been more conservative in their observations. Peguy took from Pascal several essential ideas, but his enthusiasm for the famous Christian was limited in early years by his own socialism and collectivism; in later years by the Jansenism and asceticism he discovered in Pascal. There are several of Peguy's texts which indicate his attentive and <b>passioned</b> reflexion on several of Pascal’s texts; the most notable is Clio 1 where one finds a vocabulary definitely "pascalien". Important as these texts may be, though, they are sporadic. Peguy's thoughts evolve from his reflexions on Pascal, but the end product in the development is usually dissimilar to the initial one. His ideas go beyond the limits of Pascal's. Phe encounter Peguy had with the writings of Pascal, as explained by Professor Boutroux at the Sorbonne in 1897, was a lasting one. It was a decisive shock, an "intellectual" emotion, that affected his entire slow return to Christianity. Pascal was for Peguy one of his "authors", one of the essential "fidelities" of his life...|$|E
