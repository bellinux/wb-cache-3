40|$|Mechanically pumped 2 -phase fluid loops {{often have}} the problem of {{insufficient}} sub-cooling to operate the pumps without cavitation. This paper describes the use of 2 -phase accumulators for controlling CO 2 loops to obtain forced sub-cooling and accurate evaporator control. The technique of using 2 -phase accumulators for loop control was first applied in satellite cooling. Two accumulator controlled loops have been successfully developed at NIKHEF. One CO 2 loop for cooling the AMS particle detector which will study cosmic radiation onboard the International Space Station and a second CO 2 loop is developed for cooling the LHCb-VELO particle detector which will study CP-violation at the CERN laboratory in Geneva (Switzerland). A 2 -phase accumulator {{has the advantage of}} controlling the evaporator and condenser pressures independent of the <b>primary</b> <b>cooler</b> temperature. It is therefore possible to create as much sub-cooling for the pump as desired. It is even possible to operate the loop in single phase, a feature which turns out to be very convenient during start-up and cooling-down procedures. A 2 -phase accumulator for evaporator pressure control in combination with an internal heat exchanger between the liquid feed and the 2 -phase return line creates a very stable evaporator with a guaranteed evaporation at low vapor qualities. In this way the evaporator heat transfer can be tuned and evaporator dry-out is prevented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. High {{dispersion}} CCD {{spectra of}} the spectroscopic binary Capella {{in the infrared}} He I λ 10830 ˚A line were obtained with the Shajn 2. 6 -m telescope of the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory during 1989 – 1994 over several orbital periods. An analysis of new data confirms our earlier conclusions: i) the main (narrow) He I λ 10830 ˚A line is formed in the outer atmosphere of the <b>primary,</b> <b>cooler</b> component, which is a G 6 giant, as follows from the dependence of the radial velocity curves of the He I and photospheric lines on the orbital period; and ii) the equivalent width of the He I line varies with the 104 -day orbital period of Capella’s binary. The mean level of the equivalent width values changes from year to year. We show that the amplitude of variations of the equivalent width {{as a function of}} the orbital phase becomes lower when the mean level of the equivalent width is higher. The long-term variability of the helium absorption is reliably determined from uniform CCD observations in 1985 – 1994; this variability is associated with an activity cycle with a period of 6 years (this cycle is traced through the whole set of our data since 1980). During a season when the activity level of the Capella system was high, we were able for the first time to identify the fraction of the He I absorption formed in the chromosphere of the active, hotter F 9 giant. All these helium data together with the EUV results of Dupree & Brickhouse (1995) on the high-temperature Fe XX– Fe XX III lines can be explained using a model with an enhanced magnetized stellar wind that originates from a local region on the active F 9 giant, and then forms a shock wave in the outer layers of the corona of the quiescent G 6 giant...|$|E

40|$|Many of the {{mechanical}} equipment failures at the Laboratory are due {{to the loss of}} cooling water. In order to insure the proper operating temperatures and to increase the reliability of {{the mechanical}} equipment in the D 0 Cryo Utilities Room it is necessary to provide an independent liquid cooling system. To this end, an enclosed glycoVwater cooling system which transfers heat from two vane-type vacuum pumps and an air compressor to the outside air has been installed in the Cryo Utilities Room. From the appended list {{it can be seen that}} only the Thermal Precision PFC- 121 -D and Ingersoll-Rand WAC 16 deserve closer investigation based on price. The disadvantages of the WAC 16 are that: it runs a little warmer, it requires more valving to properly install a backup pump, inlet and outlet piping are not included, and temperature and pressure indicators are not included. Its only advantage is that it is $ 818 cheaper than the PFC- 121 -D. The advantages of the PFC- 121 -D are that: it has automatic pump switching during shutdown, it has a temperature regulator on one fan control, it has a switch which indicates proper operation, has a sight glass on the expansion tank, and comes with an ASME approved expansion tank and relief valve. For these reasons the Thermal Precision PFC- 121 -D was chosen. In the past, we have always found the pond water to be muddy and to sometimes contain rocks of greater than 1 / 2 inch diameter. Thus a system completely dependent on the pond water from the accelerator was deemed unacceptable. A closed system was selected based on its ability to greatly improve reliability, while remaining economical. It is charged with a 50 / 50 glycol/water mixture capable of withstanding outside temperatures down to - 33 F. The fluid will be circulated by a totally enclosed air cooled Thermal Precision PFC- 121 -D pump. The system will be on emergency power and an automatically controlled backup pump, identical to the primary, is available should the main pump fail. The fan unit is used as a <b>primary</b> <b>cooler</b> and the trim cooler cools the fluid further on extremely hot days. The trim cooler has also been sized to cool the system in the event of a total shutdown provided that the pond water supply has adequate pressure. Due to a broken filter, we found it necessary to install a strainer in the pond water supply line. The expansion tank separates air bubbles, ensures a net positive suction head, protects against surges and over pressurization of the system, and allows for the filling of the system without shutting it off. All piping has been installed, flushed, charged with the glycol/water mix, and hydrostatically tested to 55 psi. The condition of all pumps and flow conditions will be recorded at the PLC. It has been decided not to include the regulator valve in the pond water return line. This valve was designated by the manufacturer to reduce the amount of water flowing through the trim cooler. This is not necessary in our application. There is some concern that the cooling fluid may cool the mechanical eqUipment too much when they are not operating or during very cold days. This issue will be addressed and the conclusion appended to this engineering note...|$|E

40|$|In an open-pool type {{research}} reactor, the <b>primary</b> <b>cooling</b> {{system can}} be designed to have a downward flow inside the core during normal operation because of the plate type fuel geometry. There is a flow inversion inside the core from the downward flow by the inertia force of the primary coolant to the upward flow by the natural circulation when the pump is turned off. To delay the flow inversion time, an innovative passive system with pump flywheel and GCCT is developed to remove the residual heat. Before the <b>primary</b> <b>cooling</b> pump starts up, the water level of the GCCT {{is the same as}} that of the reactor pool. During the <b>primary</b> <b>cooling</b> pump operation, the water in the GCCT is moved into the reactor pool because of the pump suction head.

50|$|The pool-type reactor {{design of}} the EBR-II {{provides}} passive safety: the reactor core, its fuel handling equipment, and many other systems of the reactor are submerged under molten sodium. By providing a fluid which readily conducts heat from the fuel to the coolant, and which operates at relatively low temperatures, the EBR-II takes maximum advantage of expansion of the coolant, fuel, and structure during off-normal events which increase temperatures. The expansion of the fuel and structure in an off-normal situation causes the system to shut down even without human operator intervention. In April 1986, two special tests were performed on the EBR-II, in which the main <b>primary</b> <b>cooling</b> pumps were shut off with the reactor at full power (62.5 megawatts, thermal). By not allowing the normal shutdown systems to interfere, the reactor power dropped to near zero within about 300 seconds. No damage to the fuel or the reactor resulted. The same day, this demonstration was followed by another important test. With the reactor again at full power, flow in the secondary cooling system was stopped. This test caused the temperature to increase, since there was nowhere for the reactor heat to go. As the <b>primary</b> (reactor) <b>cooling</b> system became hotter, the fuel, sodium coolant, and structure expanded, and the reactor shut down. This test showed that it will shut down using inherent features such as thermal expansion, even if the ability to remove heat from the <b>primary</b> <b>cooling</b> system is lost.|$|R
