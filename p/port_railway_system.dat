50|$|In the January 2008 cabinet reshuffle, Bendukidze became Head of the State Chancellery. During his tenure, he was {{considered}} one of the most influential Georgian politicians, although he was not popular amongst opposition in the administration. He was criticized for repealing anti-monopoly legislation and introducing a liberal labor code. The opposition accused him of trying to sell off each of Georgia's strategic assets; such as sea <b>ports,</b> entire <b>railway</b> <b>system,</b> gas supply network, forests, etc.|$|R
30|$|Dar es Salaam port, {{owned by}} the Tanzania Ports Authority, is Tanzania’s {{principal}} port, with a rated capacity of 4.1 million tonnes dry cargo and 6.0 million tonnes bulk liquid cargo (Tanzania Ports Authority 2017). Improved efficiency at the port can translate into additional tonnage of imports and exports. In fact, the volume of cargo has continued to record an upward trend, partly due {{to an increase in}} the use of information systems. The port handles almost all of Tanzania’s international trade cargo and serves its landlocked neighbouring countries of Malawi, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda. These countries are connected to the <b>port</b> through two <b>railway</b> <b>systems</b> and road networks, in addition to a pipeline in the case of Zambia.|$|R

50|$|The {{transportation}} sector {{on average}} contributes some 10% to Jordan’s GDP, with transportation and communications accounting for $2.14bn in 2007. Well {{aware of the}} sector’s importance to the country’s service and industry-oriented economy, in 2008 the government formulated a new national transport strategy with the aim to improve, modernise and further privatise the sector. With no imminent solution to the ongoing security crisis in Iraq in sight, prospects for the Jordanian transport sector as a whole look bright. The country will arguably remain {{one of the major}} transit points for both goods and people destined for Iraq, while the number of tourists visiting Jordan is set to continue to increase. The main events to follow in the near future are the relocation of Aqaba’s main <b>port,</b> a national <b>railway</b> <b>system,</b> and {{the construction of a new}} terminal at QAIA. Volatility in fuel prices is almost certainly going to have negative effects on operational costs and as such may hamper the sector’s average annual growth of around 6%. However, uncertain fuel prices also offer a great deal of incentive to boost private investments in alternative modes of transport such as public buses and improved trains.|$|R
