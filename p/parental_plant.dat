In Europe, seashore mallow is highly threatened and subject of conservation actions (e. g. reintroduction). In order to define appropriate multipurpose cultivation protocols, suitable for biomass production and for conservation purposes, we investigated the effect of varying levels of soil salt content and nutrient availability on seashore mallow. As expected, seashore mallow had the best performance in terms of growth rate, flowering and fruit production when fertilizer was applied, while salt had only limited effects. Interestingly, seeds produced by fertilized plants showed a lower germination performance and higher mortality than seeds developed from non-fertilized plants. Our results highlight a trade-off between <b>parental</b> <b>plant</b> growth and seed performance, the former being enhanced and the latter being reduced by fertilizer application. The causes of this trade-off are related to a transgenerational maternal effect of fertilizer application that {{has important implications for}} seashore mallow cultivation.

For this purpose, the bacterial and fungal communities associated with the rhizosphere of GM plants were compared by culture-independent methodologies to the near-isogenic parental line. Two different soils and three stages of plant development in two different periods of the year were included. As evidenced by principal components analysis (PCA) of the PCR-DGGE profiles of evaluated community, clear differences occurred in these rhizosphere communities between soils and the periods of the year that maize was cultivated. However, there were no discernible effects of the GM lines as compared to the parental line.

40|$|The Darwinian {{theory of}} natural {{selection}} first popularized by Charles Darwin in the mid- 19 th century has been widely accepted {{as one of the}} key mechanisms of evolution.

40|$|ABSTRACT The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is {{a global}} {{biodiversity}} hotspot, but most of what remains are small fragments. Small fragments are often harsh environments for forest plant recruitment due to edge effects {{and the loss of}} frugivorous animals that provide seed dispersal. We recorded the one-year reproductive phenology of the keystone palm Syagrus romanzoffiana in small (< 2. 5 ha) Atlantic Forest fragments in southeastern Brazil. We tested the Janzen-Connell hypothesis with seed-removal experiments and followed the five-year survival of recruits in relation to the distance from <b>parental</b> <b>plants.</b> Palms produced many fruits throughout the year (mean 2, 600 /plant). More seedlings were found away from <b>parental</b> <b>plants</b> than near them, thereby supporting the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. Almost 45 % of seedlings alive in 2010 were dead five years later, but recruitment of new seedlings compensated for this mortality. Distance-dependent factors influenced the density of early ontogenetic stages, but had limited effects on juveniles or on seed removal. High seed production, seed dispersal provided by disturbance-tolerant frugivores and the relatively long-term survival of adults, seedlings and juveniles seem to allow the persistence of S. romanzoffiana in the forest fragments, but possibly at the cost of an increased clumped distribution and reduced gene flow at the landscape scale...|$|R

The practicality of this approach depends on the availability of the human enzymes, but because of inherent supply and regulatory constraints, a suitable production system is yet to be identified. Results As a promising alternative, we report the creation of "hairy root" organ cultures derived via Agrobacterium rhizogenes -mediated transformation from human acetylcholinesterase-expressing transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Acetylcholinesterase-expressing hairy root cultures had a slower growth rate, reached to the stationary phase faster and grew to lower maximal densities as compared to wild type control cultures. Acetylcholinesterase accumulated to levels of up to 3. 3 % of total soluble protein, ~ 3 fold higher than the expression level observed in the <b>parental</b> <b>plant.</b> The enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. Enzymatic properties were nearly identical to those of the transgenic plant-derived enzyme as well as to those of mammalian cell culture derived enzyme. Pharmacokinetic properties of the hairy-root culture derived enzyme demonstrated a biphasic clearing profile. We demonstrate that master banking of plant material is possible by storage at 4 °C for up to 5 months.

The main aim was to study the variation in demographic variables such as rootstock thickness, trophophyll size, plant density and sporophyll production within the populations and to analyse this variation in relation to environmental variables and floristic composition. The fern is relatively rare in Lithuania, and the populations were, with few exceptions, small. In total, 71 different vascular plant species were associated with the fern, but the average number of vascular plants was only 4. 7 per m??. The variation in species composition was significantly correlated with the distance from the coast (p = 0. 001) and a growth site on river-banks or not (p = 0. 001). Compared to studies in other countries, the rootstocks and fronds were generally big, and the rootstock density was very low. All rootstocks were connected to a <b>parental</b> <b>plant,</b> indicating that they were all results of vegetative reproduction. The sporophyll production was highly variable, and it decreased strongly with increasing canopy cover (p = 0. 001).

40|$|Changes in the {{distribution}} of methylcytosine residues along a transgene locus of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) in relation to the type of gene silencing were studied in <b>parental</b> <b>plant</b> leaves, calli, and regenerated plants derived thereof. Parental-silenced HeLo 1 (hemizygous for locus 1) plants show posttranscriptional silencing of the residing nptII (neomycin phosphotransferase II) transgene and cytosine methylation restricted to the 3 ' end and center part of the transcribed region. Here, we report that with an increasing number of cell cycles, DNA methylation changes gradually, and methylation is introduced into the promoter during cell culture and more slowly in vegetatively propagated plants. After 24 months of callus in vitro cultivation, an epigenetic variant, designated locus 1 E, was obtained in which cytosine methylation of symmetrical (CG and CNG) sites was almost complete within the 5 ' end of the nptII-transcribed region and the 35 S promoter. Further, methylation of nonsymmetrical sites appeared de novo in the promoter, whereas this type of methylation was significantly reduced in the 3 ' end of the transcribed region when compared with locus 1. The newly established epigenetic patterns were stably transmitted from calli into regenerated plants and their progeny. The protein and steady-state RNA levels remained low in locus 1 E, whereas with nuclear run-on assays, no detectable amounts of primary transcripts were found along the nptII gene, indicating that the methylated promoter became inactivated. The results suggest that a switch between posttranscriptional and transcriptional gene silencing could be a mechanism leading to irrevocable shut down of gene expression within a finite number of generations...|$|E

Whereas an opposite pattern was found in a deciduous broad-leaved forest and in a roadside site. A seed addition experiment where E. adenophorum seeds were added to each of the three habitats did not increase the number of E. adenophorum seedlings at any of the three field sites. Field and greenhouse experiments demonstrated that a soil litter layer significantly reduced the number of E. adenopho-rum seedlings during the early seedling emergence period.

The posttranscriptionally silenced (PTGS) epiallele of the Lo 1 trans-silences and trans-methylates the target Lo 2 in a hybrid (Lo 1 /Lo 2 line), while its transcriptionally silenced variant (Lo 1 E) does not. This pattern was stable over several generations in plants. However, in early Lo 1 E/Lo 2 callus, decreased transgene expression and partial loss of Lo 1 E promoter methylation compared with leaf tissue in the <b>parental</b> <b>plant</b> were observed. Analysis of small RNA species and coding region methylation suggested that the transgenes were silenced by a PTGS mechanism. The Lo 1 /Lo 2 line remained silenced, but the nonmethylated Lo 1 promoter acquired partial methylation in later callus stages. These data indicate that a cell culture process has brought both epialleles to a similar epigenetic ground. Bisulfite sequencing of the 35 S promoter within the Lo 1 silencer revealed molecules with no, intermediate, and high levels of methylation, demonstrating, to our knowledge for the first time, cell-to-cell methylation diversity of callus. Regenerated plants showed high interindividual but low intraindividual epigenetic variability, indicating that the callus-induced epiallelic variants were transmitted to plants and became fixed. We propose that epigenetic changes associated with dedifferentiation might influence regulatory pathways mediated by trans-PTGS processes...|$|E

"December 2011 "Zea mays L. is one of the world's most important and widely grown crops and is susceptible {{to a wide range of}} plant pathogens. One fungal pathogen of particular concern is Aspergillus flavus Link, which is capable of producing the secondary metabolite aflatoxin. Aflatoxin poses serious health concerns when consumed by humans and animals and when consumed in large doses can lead to abdominal pain, liver damage, and death. While regulated in the United States, many underdeveloped countries do not have the resources to monitor aflatoxin accumulation in maize and, thus, developing low aflatoxin accumulation commercial maize lines would be of great benefit. The objective of this project was to identify genotypic and phenotypic predictors of low aflatoxin accumulation that could help maize breeders develop a low aflatoxin accumulating line. The results of this work reveal the potential impact the maternal <b>parental</b> <b>plant</b> has on low aflatoxin accumulation through the movement of carbohydrates into developing kernels, how maternal tissues (e. g. husks, cob and pericarp) serve as barriers to fungal infection and the location of QTL in the maize genome associated with low aflatoxin accumulation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Aim Viability and {{successful}} colonization of propagules by an invasive species {{may depend on}} several factors, such as <b>parental</b> <b>plant</b> size and propagules&# 8217; fresh mass. Here, we tested (i) the effects of propagules&# 8217; origin (from large and small parental plants); (ii) the position in the parental stem (apical, intermediate and basal) on the early development of the new sprouts of Urochloa arrecta; and (iii) if the regeneration success of U. arrecta was related with propagule fresh mass that comes from large or small parental plants. Methods We selected 16 individuals of U. arrecta and separated them in two groups: (i) eight &# 8220;large&# 8221; (stem ± 1. 5 m) and (ii) eight &# 8220;small&# 8221; (stem ± 0. 6 m). For each individual, we cut three fragments with two nodes (considered as the &# 8220;propagule&# 8221;) from the apical, intermediate and basal portions of the stem and we measured the fresh mass (g), length (cm) and distance between the two nodes (cm) of all propagules of U. arrecta. In addition, after the experimentation, we measured the dry mass (g) and length (cm) of each new sprout of U. arrecta generated from each propagule. Results We found that large parental individuals produced sprouts with longer length and greater dry mass. In contrast, the position in the parental stem did not significant influence the development of sprouts in U. arrecta. In addition, the propagule fresh mass {{played a role in}} the development of sprouts just for propagules from small parental plants. Conclusions We found that the size of the parental individual is an important determinant of the development of new sprouts of this invasive species and the propagule fresh mass has a positive and significant influence in the success of U. arrecta only for propagules from smaller parental plants. We highlight that all propagules were viable, which could explain the reasons for this plant to be a successful invader...|$|E

Both lines stably expressed the two transgenes in the generations prior to the cross. Three independently crossed F 1 progeny were analyzed by PCR for both uidA and sgfp(S 65 T) in each plant and functional expression of GUS and GFP in F 2 seeds followed a 3 : 1 Mendelian segregation ratio and transgenes were localized by FISH to the same location as in the <b>parental</b> <b>plants.</b> FISH was used to screen F 2 plants for homozygosity of both transgenes; four homozygous plants were identified from the two crossed lines tested.

40|$|A key {{component}} shaping plant-pollinator interactions is nectar. Its volume can regulate {{the length and}} frequency of pollination events. Nectar provisioning can be costly for the plant. Once secreted by the nectaries, the sugar-rich solution is usually consumed by a floral visitor and lost for “recycling” within the plant. Nectar reduction should thus be advantageous for the plant: non-secreted carbohydrates can be reallocated within the plant to other structures promoting growth, reproduction or attraction. However, most angiosperms provide nectar. It is assumed that certain pollinator behaviors, so called partner control mechanisms, favor nectariferous over deceptive plants and ultimately {{prevent the spread of}} “cheaters”. The partner control mechanisms identified in the context of plant-pollinator mutualisms are avoidance of nectarless species, reduction of drinking time and number of flowers visited on nectarless plants. Not all behaviors are performed simultaneously, and external conditions such as plant density as well as intrinsic factors of the foraging insect can determine to which extent certain behaviors are exerted. In the present study, we analyze foraging behavior of nocturnal hawkmoths on cheating Petunia axillaris axillaris plants under several conditions. The aim of this thesis was to assess which partner control mechanisms are executed by pollinators facing nectarless/low nectar plants. We observed hawkmoth behavior in two field sites and conducted experiments with naïve and experienced hawkmoths Manduca sexta under controlled conditions. We investigated which of the foraging decision rules might potentially reduce the fitness of cheaters and thus limit their spread in a population. In field assays, we observed that the density of naturally occurring P. axillaris plants and the presence of alternative food sources can influence hawkmoth behavior on nectarless Petunias: only when food plants were abundant and dense, pollinators would reduce the number of flowers on nectarless Petunias, whereas in the lower density {{there seemed to be no}} selection against cheaters. In learning experiments under controlled conditions, we observed that none of the tested behaviors (reduction of drinking duration on nectarless plants, avoidance of nectarless plants, reduction of number of flowers visited on nectarless plants) were improved over the course of the experiment. However, in all learning trials there was a significant reduction of drinking duration on nectarless plants, indicating that this control mechanism of hawkmoths is always exerted innately. Learning might therefore not be of major importance in discrimination against cheaters in our system. We constructed a plant with extremely high phenotypic similarity to P. axillaris yet only a third of the regular nectar volume (F 25). Genotyping of F 25 revealed a high genotypic imilarity to its <b>parental</b> <b>plant</b> but failed to answer questions about the genetic background of low nectar volume. The low nectar line was used in behavioral experiments with Manduca sexta. A major goal was to find out how pollination behavior affects female reproductive success of F 25. Analogous to previous experiments, we found that the drinking duration was significantly reduced on cheaters. In hand pollination assays, F 25 produced significantly more seeds than P. axillaris, however this effect was neutralized when pollinated by Manduca sexta. The benefits of nectar reduction are thus counterbalanced by a change in pollinator foraging behavior. In the future, we would like to assess which other fitness parameters are concerned when a plant ceases its nectar production. Altogether, we were able to show which foraging rules are exerted by hawkmoths on cheating P. axillaris and how one partner control mechanism, namely drinking duration, affects seed set of a plant with reduced nectar offerings. We hope that this work has contributed to answering questions about the costs and benefits of cheating...|$|E
40|$|Jatropha can be {{propagated}} vegetatively by cuttings and grafting or by seeds. It is a allogamous plant, when propagated via seed originates progenies {{with high}} genetic variability, later production, but with developed tap root which gives great plant vigor {{and resistance to}} prolonged drought. When propagated vegetatively presents the same characteristics as the <b>parental</b> <b>plant,</b> just secondary roots were developed, but with early fruit production. The technique of grafting also gives more precocity to the plants, with the advantage of combining rootstock resistance with the graft yield. The present study aimed to develop techniques for Jatropha propagation by cuttings, grafting and seed systems. Four experiments were conducted, {{and the first one}} aimed to test the rooting and vegetative development of plants from different types of cuttings (basal, middle and apical) on two types of substrates (sand and vermiculite). The second evaluated the rooting of cuttings (basal, middle and apical) from branches stored in ambient conditions for 30 and 60 days. The third experiment aimed to evaluate the antioxidant effect of citric acid in cuts before grafting and the use of two systems for setting grafts string and gauze. The last experiment evaluated seed germination and early seedling development of Jatropha as a function of environment and time of seed storage. When propagated by cuttings and using different substrates for rooting, Jatropha basal cuttings provide a higher percentage of living cuttings, as well as cuttings installed in vermiculite also had a higher percentage of survival. At the end of the experiment the basal cuttings were superior to others in all variables analyzed, as well as those in vermiculite. Regarding storage of Jatropha branches for later use, it is concluded that the storage of Jatropha branches up to 30 days is feasible under the conditions studied andthe basal part of the cuttings [...] . O pinhão manso pode ser propagado de forma vegetativa através de estacas e enxertia ou via seminífera. Por ser uma planta de polinização cruzada, quando propagado via sementes origina indivíduos com alta variabilidade genética, produção mais tardia, no entanto com desenvolvimento de raiz pivotante, o que confere às plantas maior vigor e resistência a secas prolongadas. Quando propagado vegetativamente apresenta as mesmas características da planta mãe, desenvolvem apenas raízes secundárias, e são mais precoces na produção de frutos. A técnica da enxertia também confere maior precocidade às plantas enxertas, com a vantagem de poder combinar resistência do porta enxerto com produtividade do enxerto. O presente trabalho teve como objetivo desenvolver técnicas de propagação para pinhão manso através de estacas, sistemas de enxertia e sementes. Foram desenvolvidos 4 experimentos, sendo que o primeiro experimento avaliou o pegamento por meio de avaliações do desenvolvimento vegetativo de diferentes tipos de estacas (basal, mediana e apical) de pinhão manso em dois tipos de substratos (areia e vermiculita). O segundo avaliou o enraizamento de estacas (basal, mediana e apical) provenientes de ramos armazenados em condições ambientes por 30 e 60 dias. O terceiro experimento objetivou avaliar o efeito do antioxidante ácido cítrico nos cortes antes da realização da enxertia e o uso de dois sistemas de fixação dos enxertos, barbante e gaze. O último experimento avaliou a germinação de sementes e o desenvolvimento inicial de plântulas de pinhão manso em função do ambiente e do tempo de armazenamento das sementes. Quando propagado por estacas e utilizando diferentes substratos para enraizamento, as estacas basais de pinhão manso proporcionam uma maior porcentagem de estacas vivas, assim como estacas instaladas em vermiculita também apresentaram uma maior porcentagem de [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Snap {{beans are}} the {{vegetable}} form of dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) with low fiber, stringless and round, succulent pods that are eaten in the immature stage. Seed companies commit significant resources to maintaining purity and uniformity of snap bean cultivars. While some variability may be introduced through outcrossing (beans are highly self-pollinated but occasional outcrosses do occur) and mechanical mixes of seed, mutation may {{also play a}} role. For traits such as pod cross-section (round vs. oval or flat), pod wall fiber and pod suture fiber (strings), reversions from the snap bean phenotype (round, low fiber, stringless) to the dry bean phenotype (oval or flat, high fiber, stringy) may occur. The reversions occur at many times the background mutation rate and are called "rogues" in the industry. Many cultivars, both commercially released and OSU bred show rogue traits and in the OSU breeding program, lines are grown out and inspected for off types every year. Among the rogue traits, strings and oval pods are of greatest concern. The reversions of round and stringless pods are of the most economically costly phenomena. In the past century scientists have studied snap bean pod traits, including suture strings, ovals and increased pod wall fiber per se. Results reported by researchers are in conflict regarding the heritability and gene models, including specific gene(s) controlling the phenotypic traits of interests. In addition, the advent of new molecular tools allows us to examine the reversion phenomenon at the molecular level. In the present study, three major approaches were used {{to get at the}} rogue question. First, we observed the inheritance of traits of interest by collecting seed of 98 off type plants representing 11 cultivars and breeding lines. These plants were self-pollinated and grown and classified for phenotype over three generations. Results obtained from this study revealed that traits were initially segregating in every case, but families became increasingly fixed over time. However, observed segregation ratios failed to fit expected segregation ratios. In addition, some families that were nearly fixed still showed a few individuals of the opposite phenotype. From the selfing of individual plants, we saw skewed segregation ratios that did not fit previous published inheritance models, any classical Mendalian one or two gene models or the populations within varieties segregating in a similar manner. Analyzing phenotype data showed an association of string with low or moderately low fiber content, which is congruent with non-rogue fixed pods, while oval pods showed association to high or moderately high fiber content. The second avenue of research was to make controlled crosses to conduct tests of allelism and inheritance. The objective of inheritance crosses was to decipher the dominance-recessive relationships of strings and ovals. The test of allelism, by crossing two stringy off type plants was to determine if strings were controlled by the same or different loci in different genetic backgrounds. A test of inheritance, by crossing an off type to a <b>parental</b> <b>plant</b> (string by stringless), was made to shed light on the genetic model of the trait. Due to time limitations, only the first hybrid generation was grown, which revealed dominance for the stringless and round pod phenotype. The third research strategy was to initiate molecular analysis using genotyping by sequencing (GBS) of a pooled sample of stringless genotypes compared to a pooled set of stringy genotypes to find single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the two groups that would suggest candidate gene(s) for string (or lack of string) formation. Ninety-six samples split into two genotype pools (stringy and stringless), both with low fiber content were sequenced. In the stringy pool 31, 212 SNPs were initially found and 38, 936 SNPs were found in the stringless pool. SNPs with low quality and probability, due to low read depth, and SNPs that did not have a high impact on the gene itself (high impact SNPs are those with altered start, stop or splice sites that change gene function) were removed. Forty-three SNPs in the stringless pool that differed from the reference genome and 41 in the stringy pool were annotated as candidate genomic regions of control. Due to the fact that off types within the same family showed a lack of homogeneity for the phenotypic data within varieties, the high impact polymorphisms could have been due to factors other than the trait of interest. None of our SNPs of interest were present in published candidate genes for pod suture strings, fiber, or pod shattering, but novel areas of the genome were identified. Using our SNP data and putative candidate regions that have been identified, expression in these regions can be analyzed to further refine the list of potential candidate gene(s) controlling strings...|$|E

40|$|Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) of {{male sterile}} tobacco plants obtained by fusion of Nicotiana tabacum protoplasts and X-irradiated N. debneyi pro-toplasts were analyzed. Digestion of cpDNA isolated from ten male sterile lines with four restric-tion endonucleases (EcoRl, Xhol, Smal and Hindlll) indicated that these lines possessed either {{one or the}} other parental chloroplast genome. Neither mixture of two types of cpDNA nor uni-que restriction fragments were detected in any of the cases examined. The genetic constitution of chloroplast genomes identified by restriction analysis of cpDNA showed good agreement with that based on isoelectric focusing of the large subunit of the Fraction I protein. The mtDNA from five fusion-derived male sterile plants showed banding patterns quite different from each other and from the <b>parental</b> <b>plants.</b> Each plant exhibited new restriction fragments not found in the parental species. These findings indicate that recombinational events in the mitochondrial genomes take place rather frequently in the mixed cytoplasms after protoplast fusion, whereas the mixed chloroplasts become segregated to homogeneity...|$|R
