5|$|In humans, sodium is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as <b>pickled</b> <b>preserves</b> and jerky; for Americans, most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate. The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3grams per day, but the average person in the United States consumes 3.4grams per day. Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mmHg. It {{has been estimated that}} such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to between 9 and 17% fewer cases of hypertension.|$|E

40|$|Fish pickles (with olive and tamarind) were {{prepared}} from mola fish (Amblypharyngodon mola) and their nutritional and food quality were assessed.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationship between stomach cancer and the low intake of fresh fruit and vegetables and/or a high intake of <b>pickled,</b> <b>preserved</b> or salted foods and frequent use of cooking oil. During 139   390 person–year of follow-up of over 13   000 subjects, 116 died from stomach cancer. Using a Cox proportional hazards–regression analysis of relative risk (RR, 95 % CI) controlling for age, sex, smoking and other dietary factors, a significant decline was found with a high consumption of green and yellow vegetables (RR= 0. 4, 95 % CI= 0. 2 – 0. 9). Reductions of between 40 and 50 % were also observed with a high consumption of fresh foods (fruit, cuttle fish, tofu, and potatoes), but these associations were not statistically significant. The risk was significantly increased by the high consumption of processed meat (RR= 2. 7, 95 % CI= 1. 0 - 7. 4) and by the frequent use of cooking oil (RR= 4. 0, 95 % CI= 1. 3 - 11. 8). The high consumption of pickled food and traditional soups also increased risk, but not significantly. The findings suggest that a diet high in salt and low in vitamins may be associated with an increase in stomach cancer...|$|R
