Both Atmosphères and Lontano have a dense canonic structure. But you cannot actually hear the polyphony, the canon. You hear a kind of impenetrable texture, something like a very densely woven cobweb. I have retained melodic lines in the process of composition, they are governed by rules as strict as Palestrina's or those of the Flemish school, but the rules of this polyphony are worked out by me. The <b>polyphonic</b> <b>structure</b> does not come through, you cannot hear it; it remains hidden in a microscopic, underwater world, to us inaudible. I call it micropolyphony (such a beautiful word!). (Ligeti, quoted in [...] ).|$|E

5000|$|New Objectivity in music, as in {{the visual}} arts, {{rejected}} the sentimentality of late Romanticism and the emotional agitation of expressionism. Composer Paul Hindemith may be considered both a New Objectivist and an expressionist, depending on the composition, throughout the 1920s; for example, his wind quintet [...] Op. 24 No. 2 (1922) was designed as one may compare his operas Sancta Susanna (part of an expressionist trilogy) and [...] (a parody of modern life). His music typically harkens back to baroque models and makes use of traditional forms and stable <b>polyphonic</b> <b>structures,</b> together with modern dissonance and jazz-inflected rhythms. Ernst Toch and Kurt Weill also composed New Objectivist music during the 1920s. Though known late in life for his austere interpretations of the classics, in earlier years, conductor Otto Klemperer was the most prominent to ally himself with this movement.|$|R
5000|$|A {{second problem}} in {{applying}} these systems {{is a question}} of range specification. This is particularly a problem when trying to apply the choral music system to the non-classical singer. The choral system was developed to delineate <b>polyphonic</b> <b>structure</b> and was not really intended to designate a vocal type to individual singers. In other words, choral music was designed to be broken down into four vocal sections and it is the sections themselves that are labeled soprano, alto, tenor, and bass and not the individual singers. For example, most women that sing the alto line in choirs would be considered mezzo-sopranos in opera due to their vocal timbre and their particular range resting somewhere in the middle between a soprano and contralto. A small portion of them, however, would most likely be contraltos. Therefore, one could say, [...] "I am a mezzo-soprano singing the alto line", and the other [...] "I am a contralto singing the alto line." [...] They have two different ranges and sounds but they are singing the same part. This is important to understand, because it means that choral music isn't really about vocal type but about vocal range within a specific type of music: choral music.It is not uncommon for men with higher voices to sing the alto line or women with lower voices to sing the tenor line. It is, however, improper for a man to call himself an alto or a soprano, or a woman a tenor or bass. A woman who sings the tenor line is really a contralto when applied to the classical vocal type system, and a man who sings alto or soprano a countertenor or sopranist.|$|E

The collection Sacrae cantiones (Venice 1620) by Ivan Lukačić from Šibenik is valuable testimony of sacral music that was performed in Split, and is generally speaking, one of the most significant monuments of old Croatian music altogether. Also, worth mentioning is Ragusino Vincenzo Comnen, the only representative of the music of the Dubrovnik nobility.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my study is two-fold: first, {{to suggest that}} the <b>polyphonic</b> <b>structure</b> was born within the {{monophonic}} structure of Don Quixote making it a unique hybrid novel; second, to demonstrate the extent of the profound influence that Don Quixote produced on Dostoevsky while the latter worked on his novel The Idiot. ^ While Dostoevsky is considered to be the creator of the polyphonic novel, Cervantes, I believe, was the first writer who employed the <b>polyphonic</b> <b>structure</b> in Don Quixote. This novel is a unique blend of the classic homophonic novel that widely employs the <b>polyphonic</b> <b>structure</b> in order to fulfill the artistic will of Cervantes: to give voice to the idea. The idea in Don Quixote becomes a fully fledged subject, it lives and acts almost like a human being. This result can only be achieved if the author disregards the limits of the classical homophonic novel, and Cervantes decisively made one step further in order to explore the <b>polyphonic</b> <b>structure</b> and its expressive capabilities. This decisive step toward the polyphony was possible because Cervantes already formed his specific artistic view toward the outside world—the dialogical exploration of the idea. In this dialogical world Don Quixote refuses to be restricted by the limits of the homophonic structure. He starts to act outside of the prescribed boundaries of the monological concept of his existence where the hero can never become more than he is. Cervantes removes these chains from his hero, and he removes these chains from other characters as well. Into this free world, that was now only controlled but not dominated by the author, heteroglossia made it possible to bring other subjects of equal value, and these new subjects started to control the world they have populated. I want to call it the Literary Constitutional Monarchy where the voice of the demos is finally heard on the top. The ideas and thoughts now communicate freely in all directions, vertically and horizontally. To satisfy the needs of these independent subjects that populated this so far empty continent—polyphony had to be born. ^ My study also attempts to analyze not only the problem of polyphony in Don Quixote but also the multi-faceted influence that Cervantes exercised on Dostoevsky 2 ̆ 7 s novel The Idiot. The choice of the novel is not arbitrary: out of three great novels of Dostoevsky only The Idiot can be considered the direct heir of Don Quixote with whom it shares not only the polyphonic nature but also the idea. There are not many books in universal literature that share the idea and Don Quixote and The Idiot do it {{to such an extent that}} they can justifiably be called the twin novels. This notion becomes a cornerstone for my investigation. ^ I suggest that the influence of Cervantes on Russian genius is much stronger and much more complex than is normally thought. In my study I want to explore more in depth only one of the aspects of this influence: the process of the appropriation of Don Quixote by Dostoevsky on Russian soil. The result of such an appropriation became the novel—The Idiot —the twin novel, where the main idea of Don Quixote was reborn and appropriated on Russian soil. To show the results of such an appropriation is the second focus of my study. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} is to {{investigate}} to which extent the novel Kvinnor och äppelträd by Moa Martinson can be classified as a polyphonic novel. The concept polyphony was established in literary theory by the Russian language theorist and literary critic Michail Bachtin in 1929, in his book Problems of Dostoevsky’s poetics. In order to understand and comprehend the concept of polyphony I have used an interpretation due to the literature scholar Robyn McCallum. She notes that the characters in a polyphonic novel function as focalizers. All fictional characters create their own basis of social, cultural and ideological opinions and values, from which they provide their particular perspective on the story. Therefore, when fictional characters and their socio-ideological viewpoints intersect, a rather complex structure of interaction, dialogues and intersubjectivity is created between them.   Kvinnor och äppelträd is {{according to the most}} prominent scholar in the field, Ebba Witt-Brattström, a polyphonic novel. Her presumption is based upon the plurality of voices that is expressed in the novel, and the ambiguous interaction between them. However, {{to the best of my}} knowledge, no profound investigation of the novel’s <b>polyphonic</b> <b>structure</b> has yet been undertaken, and therefore this essay is dedicated to this task. For this purpose I have performed an analysis of the narratology in the novel, resulting in the overall conclusion that Kvinnor och äppelträd is indeed a polyphonic novel. Since the concept of polyphony also implies a modernistic feature, one can discuss the fact that Kvinnor och äppelträd has been classified as working class literature, and not modernistic literature. The final conclusion of the essay is that the complex <b>polyphonic</b> <b>structure</b> of the novel, and its controversial and pioneering content, have been underestimated and ignored. Regarding this aspect Moa Martinson should have been categorized under the Swedish literary modernism...|$|E

40|$|The {{historical}} development of Georgian traditional {{music has been}} marked by an absolute predominance of vocal music and distinguished by high aesthetic val-ues, rich in regional styles and original <b>polyphonic</b> <b>structures.</b> At some stage of the last century a twofold stream joined the national musical treasury.

40|$|Thesis title: Formal {{methods for}} the design of {{imitative}} <b>polyphonic</b> <b>structures</b> Keywords: stacked canon, stretto, fugue, algorithmic composition, counterpoint, counterpointing approach, intervallic approach, harmoniola, rotational array, relative chord tone, dux-graph, graph theory, Eulerian cycle, Hamiltonian cycle, constraint logic programming, chord sequence, chord sequence modulation Abstract This thesis defines novel and efficient methods {{for the design}} of stacked canons and their use in imitative <b>polyphonic</b> <b>structures.</b> Chapter 1 discusses the development of canon- and fugue-techniques and their connection in stretto-fugues such as found in Bach’s ‘Kunst der Fugue’. Several examples show that larger <b>polyphonic</b> <b>structures</b> are sustainable by a main theme which can appear in many different canons, called stretti. Hence, techniques to effectively design such themes require the availability of efficient techniques for the creation of several types of canons. In search of such techniques, chapter 2 provides a theoretical basis {{for the remainder of the}} thesis. An analysis of the established counterpointing and intervallic approaches to the construction of stacked canons shows that these provide limited harmonic control and are computationally complex. While efficient and in complete control of harmony, Morris’ Tonnetz approach targets serial stacked canons ad minimum and does not encompass voice-leading constraints. A style-independent, constructive approach using relative chord tones, chord sequences and chord sequence modulations is presented along with its connections to graph-theory in address of these issues. An analysis of Rameau’s Canon at the Fifth from his Traité de l’harmonie introduces the concept of relative chord tones and incorporates two constraints discussed in the Traité in the newly proposed relative chord tone model, namely, obtaining complete chords, and, preparation and resolution of sevenths. The analysis explains Rameau’s choice of dux and chord sequence in terms of the conjunction of these constraints. Using my definition of restless dux graphs, the problem of obtaining complete chords is reduced to the Hamiltonian cycle problem in a dux graph. The problem of finding a dux according to the conjunction of the aforementioned constraints is reduced to the definition of a generating function. An approach to the incorporation of voice leading constraints is sketched, by the detailed discussion of prohibitions of firstly parallel octaves, and secondly, parallel fifths. After deriving a least upper bound on the maximum number of voices in a stacked canon without parallel octaves in terms of the canon’s chord sizes, the problem of finding a dux for such a stacked canon with a maximum number of voices is reduced to the Eulerian cycle problem in a restless dux graph. It is also proved that the conjunction of either constraint reduces the aforementioned least upper bound by a single voice. My definition of dux graphs with rests allows the definition of two near linear dux generation algorithms which respectively satisfy the first and either constraint. The problem of constraining the inversion of chords is discussed in terms of the incorporation of a constraint which prohibits 6 / 4 chords. The remainder of the chapter discusses two methods which allow variations in a stacked canon’s melody based on a predetermined chord sequence, followed by a discussion which counts the number of distinct sub-canons of a stacked canon. It is established that the latter number shows double exponential growth in the chord sizes of a chosen chord sequence, in demonstration of the applicability of my methods to the design of thematic material for use in larger scale imitative <b>polyphonic</b> <b>structures.</b> Chapter 3 discusses my compositions Spiral which is based on several themes, the main two of which were derived as relative chord tone sequences using results from chapter 2. The chapter also discusses several techniques related to the organization of polythematic stacked canonic structures in larger scale composition. The first movement was designed in terms of several harmoniolas, in which neither of the aforementioned themes appears in a stretto. The second movement is designed as a passacaglia structure based on the aforementioned second theme, onto which many distinct combinations of either theme are superimposed. The final movement mirrors the structure of the first movement, testing my conjecture that the use of a chromatic mirror axis can mirror the affects experienced by an audience. Chapter 4 discusses my composition Fugue in G, the main theme of which was derived as a Hamiltonian cycle in the underlying dux graph. The fugue contains many stretti whence the chapter provides further a discussion on the organization of polythematic canonic structures in larger scale composition. While the theory presented in chapter 2 enables one to derive efficient algorithms for the generation of stacked canons adhering to personal stylistic preferences, their derivation may be tedious. This is especially so when experimenting with different rules. Chapter 5 discusses a method which uses constraint logic programs with relative chord tone domains to efficiently search for the thematic material of polythematic stacked canonic structures. The composition process for my ‘Missa ad Fugam’ is discussed in demonstration of this technique. The Mass uses three main themes, each of which allows a four-voice stacked canon, and each pair of which allows a four-voice stacked double canon. Finally, chapter 6 summarizes the main results of this thesis and provides an outlook on future research...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This chapter {{introduces}} {{a theoretical framework}} for analyzing collaborative problem solving in chats, based {{on the concept of}} polyphony and Bakhtin’s theory of dialog. Polyphony, a notion taken from music theory, may be considered as a general model for interaction and creativity by a group of people (“voices, ” in an extended sense) following patterns of counterpoint. As Bakhtin emphasized, polyphony may occur in texts; we will show that it can occur in problem-solving chat texts. One of the features of polyphonic music is its potential development of complex architectures starting from a given theme. <b>Polyphonic</b> <b>structuring</b> of dialogs may transform the interaction into a “thinking device”: Different voices jointly construct a melody (story or solution), sometimes adopting different positions and then generating, identifying or solving dissonances (unsound, rickety stories or solutions). Polyphony consists of several “horizontal, ” longitudinal melody lines that are “vertically, ” transversally integrated. Similarly, in chats, the continuations of utterances are tied together over time providing a melodic line. Simultaneously, they are coordinated with the utterances of others, maintaining the integration toward unity across various themes and variations that sometimes can introduce differences.

The parody technique allows Anerio to quote both entire <b>polyphonic</b> <b>structures</b> and single melodic lines. Despite the strong convergence essential for the procedure of parody, the composer was able to present their own solutions while adhering to the rules of classical counterpoint and the style of his famous Roman predecessor. Thus, the piece is entirely based on Palestrina’s ideas, such as interweaving phrases with the equality of votes, or shaping of phrases with Anerio’s own texture very alike. Therefore, the Mass, based on the perception of parody in the late Renaissance era, should be assessed as a perfect musical work...|$|R
40|$|Atwood {{comments}} that her MaddAddam trilogy is neither apocalyptic nor utopian. Nor is the Waterless Flood, the central catastrophic event {{around which the}} various narratives of the trilogy cohere, an ecological catastrophe, but, instead, is the consequence of an act of bioterrorism meant to forestall such a possibility. Nonetheless, it is argued, following Laurence Coupe’s mythic schema, that Atwood’s trilogy can be understood in an alternative sense of apocalypse, that of revelation, an imaginative exploration of possibilities rather than {{the end of all}} possibilities that a literalist interpretation of this key biblical myth entails. The study uses Coupe’s mythic schema to analyse some of the biblical myths that Atwood employs in her trilogy and builds on Watkins’s distinction between monologic, pessimistic and tragic male apocalyptic fiction and dialogic, optimistic and comic female apocalyptic fiction. It shows how the <b>polyphonic</b> <b>structure</b> of the whole trilogy transcends the apparent pessimistic content of the novels, particularly of the first instalment Oryx and Crake, pointing imaginatively to permanent possibility and hope, even if the future may be post-human.

40|$|This article {{claims that}} Svetlana Aleksievich’s Voices from Utopia {{should be read}} as testimony. Although based on eyewitnesses interviewed by Aleksievich, the voices {{represented}} in the five books are interpreted as {{the creation of an}} implied author. In contrast to a theoretical standpoint defining fact in a dichotomous relation to fiction, this study identifies the historical value of Aleksievich’s writing as intimately connected to the aesthetic composition. The article has two major aims. The first is to describe how the monologues and choirs in Voices from Utopia are represented. Using Mikhail Bakhtin’s concept of the polyphonic novel, the internal focalization of the testimonies, in combination with a significant reduction of the external perspective, both on the level of dialogue and narration, are described as together constituting a polyphonic composition. The second aim is to demonstrate how this polyphony is interrelated to trauma theory and the psychological hardships experienced by the witnesses in the act of representing a traumatic experience. The hypothesis is that the <b>polyphonic</b> <b>structure</b> could be interpreted as an ethical representation of the interviews: first, it reflects an empathy with the witnesses’ ambivalence when confessing their traumatic past; secondly, because it contributes to ethically engaging the implied reader...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a machine {{learning}} model for voice separation in lute tablature. Lute tablature is a practical notation that reveals only very limited information about <b>polyphonic</b> <b>structure.</b> This has complicated research into the large surviving corpus of lute music, notated exclusively in tablature. A solution {{may be found in}} automatic transcription, of which voice separation is a necessary step. During the last decade, several methods for separating voices in symbolic polyphonic music formats have been developed. However, all but two of these methods adopt a rule-based approach; moreover, none of them is designed for tablature. Our method differs on both these points. First, rather than using fixed rules, we use a model that learns from data: a neural network that predicts voice assignments for notes. Second, our method is specifically designed for tablature—tablature information is included in the features used as input for the models—but it can also be applied to other music corpora. We have experimented on a dataset containing tablature pieces of different polyphonic textures, and compare the results against those obtained from a baseline hidden Markov model (HMM) model. Additionally, we have performed a preliminary comparison of the neural network model with several existing methods for voice separation on a small dataset. We have found that the neural network model performs clearly better than the baseline model, and competitively with the existing methods. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} model for {{granular}} synthesis in which the internal content (spectrum) of grains are defined as Fuzzy Sets. Markov Chains modulated by Membership Matrices related to the internal structure of the sound grains are used to control {{the evolution of the}} sound in time. The final sequenc-ing of grains (sound stream) is controlled by the so called Walsh Functions. Using a number of channels the outputs may have complex <b>polyphonic</b> sound <b>structures.</b> We also provide the mathematical foundations of the model. 1...|$|R
5000|$|According to Schliessmann, [...] "Chopin is the {{crowning}} and climax of piano-playing. It's something so unique, all-affecting in emotionalism, musical architecture, and structure, that all past giants {{are present in}} it: Bach and Mozart. Chopin's elegance is so singular, that again you need much experience to convey his music in the real and original style. The question of rubato is very sensitive: It's nothing arbitrary, but much more something well calculated and well proportioned, something that is integrated in the classical strength of form, which is constructed on the profound knowledge of the <b>polyphonic</b> and contrapuntal <b>structures</b> of Bach and Mozart." ...|$|R
40|$|Modes in the Renaissance era were {{vital to}} {{understand}} {{the inner workings of}} a piece. Modal theory implies every Renaissance composition should have a distinct mode in which it belongs. The mode of any piece from this era is theoretically obvious by the first or last note of the piece as well as the range given, but researchers have argued the validity of this claim. Complications arise in the case of pieces with two or more voices. Polyphonic music causes uncertainty regarding the method of identifying the mode of a piece. This paper will look deeply at the Missa Papae Marcelli by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina in an attempt to decipher the process used to find the mode in polyphonic music. The Missa Papae Marcelli is a work scored for six independent voices, with some movements being reduced to only four voices. Analysis of this piece will be done to prove that a mode can be established in polyphonic works, and to explain the validity of modal theory in deeply complex, <b>polyphonic</b> musical <b>structures...</b>|$|R
