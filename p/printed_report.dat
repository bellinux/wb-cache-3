Other sluices were erected at Boston in 1500 and at Langrick in 1543, but navigation was again difficult on both {{the river and the}} Fossdyke by 1660. In 1671 an Act of Parliament was obtained for the improvement of the Navigation. In 1743, John Grundy, Sr. and his son John Grundy, Jr. were commissioned to produce a detailed survey of the river. They produced an engraved map in 1743 and a <b>printed</b> <b>report,</b> running to 48 pages, in the following year. The main recommendation was a [...] new cut to eliminate the [...] "prodigious meandering course" [...] of the channel above Boston. Although the estimated cost of £16,200 dissuaded the landowners from taking action at the time, the report formed the basis for improvements in the 1760s.|$|E

The parts which were trusted to extempore speaking are supplied, as well as I can remember (only with an addition here and there of things I forgot to say), in the words, or at least the kind of words, used at the time; and they contain, at all events, the substance of what I said more accurately than hurried journal reports. I must beg my readers not in general to trust to such, for even in fast speaking I try to use words carefully; and any alteration of expression will sometimes involve a great alteration in meaning. A little while ago I had to speak of an architectural design, and called it [...] "elegant," [...] meaning, founded on good and well [...] "elected" [...] models; the <b>printed</b> <b>report</b> gave [...] "excellent" [...] design (that is to say, design excellingly good), which I did not mean, and should, even in the most hurried speaking, never have said.|$|E

A <b>printed</b> <b>report</b> from the Bedford magistrates appeared in 1818, and Henry Grey Bennet cited Hunt on prison discipline from it; and in the debate leading to the Prisons Act 1823 Hunt suggested a clause on transfer of prisoners to Bennet.|$|E

5000|$|Turkey {{implemented}} the first smart card driver's license system in 1987. Turkey {{had a high}} level of road accidents and decided to develop and use digital tachograph devices on heavy vehicles, instead of the existing mechanical ones, to reduce speed violations. Since 1987, the professional driver's licenses in Turkey have been issued as smart cards. A professional driver is required to insert his driver's license into a digital tachograph before starting to drive. The tachograph unit records speed violations for each driver and gives a <b>printed</b> <b>report.</b> The driving hours for each driver are also being monitored and reported. In 1990 the European Union conducted a feasibility study through BEVAC Consulting Engineers, titled [...] "Feasibility study with respect to a European electronic drivers license (based on a smart-card) on behalf of Directorate General VII". In this study, chapter seven describes Turkey's experience.|$|E
