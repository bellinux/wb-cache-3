5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Nigel Dick and was filmed from 4 to 6 October 1999 at the Mission Tiki drive-in theatre in Montclair, California. In the video, Raven sings the song while {{she is in a}} car with a boy, while Larsen sings and plays the guitar in front of another car. This footage is mixed with M2M singing together at the drive-in, people dancing, the projectionist struggling with his malfunctioning equipment, and the concession stand worker who has an overflowing <b>popcorn</b> maker. When the <b>popcorn</b> stand explodes, M2M continue to perform surrounded by people as <b>popcorn</b> rains down. Air cannons were used to fire 200 garbage bin-sized bags of <b>popcorn</b> into the air to create the raining <b>popcorn</b> effect. In the US the music video made its premiere on 24 October on The WB following that night's screening of 7th Heaven. It began airing on The Box and MuchMusic in early November 1999 and began airing on MTV on 15 November.|$|E

5|$|Donald is {{armed with}} a special gun that can shoot plungers, <b>popcorn</b> or bubble gum. Donald has {{unlimited}} plungers which can temporarily stun enemies (though bosses can still be damaged with plungers), and can collect <b>popcorn</b> and gum along the way or get the latter from Gyro Gearloose. Later in the game, the plunger is upgraded {{to act as a}} temporary platform to climb walls with and, when stuck to a passing bird, allows Donald to traverse longer distances. In Duckburg, India and Egypt, Donald can also pick up chili peppers which increase his temper, eventually temporarily allowing him to become invincible, increase his speed and knock out enemies in his path.|$|E
5|$|They {{moved to}} Los Angeles in 1954, where Mansfield studied Theater Arts at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) during the summer, and {{returned}} to Texas to spend the fall quarter at Southern Methodist University. She managed to maintain a B grade average, between a variety of odd jobs, including selling <b>popcorn</b> at the Stanley Warner Theatre, teaching dance, vending candy at a movie theater, modeling part-time at the Blue Book Model Agency, and working as a photographer at Esther Williams' Trails Restaurant.|$|E
5|$|They then wander to the {{concessions}} stand. There the babies find <b>popcorn,</b> orange and grape sodas, lids, napkins, cups, candy bars, ketchup, mustard and straws (the two teenage employees in charge, Larry and Steve, don't notice the babies because they're arguing over comic books). Tommy checks the <b>popcorn</b> both for Reptar, while Phil and Lil take {{interest in the}} soda dispensers, pushing the buttons and spilling the soft drinks on the counters and floors until eventually they get stuck continuously pouring soda. Meanwhile, Chuckie, after sampling some candy, notices some stairs leading up while Phil and Lil start playing with the ketchup and mustard dispensers by the hot dog sections. Phil & Lil plays with straws and spill all the straws. After Chuckie points out the stairs, Tommy concludes they'll find Reptar upstairs. As soon as the babies leave, the two teenagers notice the massive mess and scream.|$|E
5|$|Although boogaloo {{was already}} a fad dance and a music genre in the 1960s, it did not become a dance style until Boogaloo Sam learned it, {{expanded}} it, and started performing it in public venues. He was influenced to expand boogaloo by cartoons; the 1960s social dances the Twist, the <b>Popcorn,</b> and the Jerk; and the movements of everyday people. As a dance style, it is characterized by rolling hip, knee, and head movements as if the body has no bones. Electric boogaloo is the signature dance style of The Electric Boogaloos. It {{is a combination of}} boogaloo and popping.|$|E
5|$|Food {{selection}} at {{the restaurant}} comes from the traditional cuisine of the United States. <b>Popcorn</b> is served as a free hors d'oeuvre. Other food items include milkshakes, hot fudge sundaes, seafood salad, turkey sloppy joes, fried pickles, St. Louis-style barbecue ribs, beef-and-blue-cheese salads, saut√©ed shrimp with farfalle, French fries, cucumber salads, Buffalo wings, Boca Burgers, Tofutti, and steaks.

5|$|It is a {{collaboration}} {{with one of}} my friends from the international music industry, Eric Turner, a very talented guy from Sweden, and with the boys from Play & Win. It is very particular. I consider that I went through all stages, from <b>popcorn</b> to dance, club and pop music, so I considered that I have reached a maturity which allows me to release a song which I like, which makes me move in a club and makes me want to hear it on the radio, and I'm very fulfilled.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{a casino}} in the 1920s, the Rosendale Theater {{was seized by}} the village and {{converted}} into a theater in 1949 by Anthony Cacchio, a man who bore a strong resemblance to filmmaker Otto Preminger. The first film shown on opening night in February 1949 was Blood on the Moon. Caccio owned the building outright by 1954, and operated it with his son, Anthony Cacchio Jr., who banned <b>popcorn</b> in the theater in 1969. The theater served as the village's fire department at one point.|$|E
5|$|Rice, pasta, and potato-based foods (french {{fries and}} mashed potato) also make {{up part of}} Zimbabwean cuisine. A local {{favourite}} is rice cooked with peanut butter, which is taken with thick gravy, mixed vegetables and meat. A potpourri of peanuts known as nzungu, boiled and sundried maize, black-eyed peas known as nyemba, and bambara groundnuts known as nyimo makes a traditional dish called mutakura. Mutakura can also be the above ingredients cooked individually. One can also find local snacks, such as maputi (roasted/popped maize kernels similar to <b>popcorn),</b> roasted and salted peanuts, sugar cane, sweet potato, pumpkin, and indigenous fruits, such as horned melon, gaka, adansonia, mawuyu, uapaca kirkiana, mazhanje (sugar plum), and many others.|$|E
5|$|Schneider {{left the}} St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2005, {{arriving}} at the Baltimore Sun. While at the Sun, he began an investigative series into the use of diacetyl as a food flavoring for consumer products like microwave <b>popcorn.</b> The chemical {{was found to have}} been causing lung-related diseases in workers at plants, including Bronchiolitis obliterans ("popcorn lung"), and, according to Schneider, put professional cooks at risk. The investigation resulted in greater recognition of diacetyl's hazards by the public, resulting in a reduction or elimination in its use by manufacturers like ConAgra.|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{the damage}} they've done, the babies quickly rush back downstairs as the projectionist notices the {{incredible}} mess {{and tries to}} save the film unsuccessfully. Grandpa Lou finds them after getting some snacks from the concession stand (he comments on the mess the babies caused, telling Larry and Steve how in his time {{they knew how to}} keep a work place clean). Grandpa Lou takes them back with him to the Dummi Bears movie, which catches in the projector and melts The Land Without Smiles at the climax, leaving most of the audience groaning. The babies smile at each other at this, while Grandpa Lou eats some <b>popcorn.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} had to {{move the}} filming of the beach sequences from the previous episodes due {{to changes in the}} tides at that time of year. Similar to the previous episode, the spaceship was computer-generated. The sequence where the locals are boiled by the ocean water was accomplished using underwater filming of stuntmen under various degrees of make up. Fifty thousand dead crickets were rented from a local entomologist for the scene where Scully's tent was attacked by bugs. The live insects were portrayed by blowing <b>popcorn</b> and packing foam at Anderson with fans and editing it into insects in post production.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{has made}} {{numerous}} special television guest appearances on WWE Raw, including acting as guest star on March 8, 2010. He also appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show, including the premiere episode of its 24th season. During a 2007 {{episode of the}} show, he successfully guessed the number between 1 and 100 he asked Winfrey to think of without telling him. Angel has appeared on other talk shows including The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, The Megan Mullally Show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, AVN Awards Show 2007 and Larry King Live on CNN.

5|$|Artist and {{inventor}} Bill Lishman created two sculptures {{for this}} section of the park, as well as some smaller works for application to the buildings. The most prominent is a dragon {{at the entrance to the}} Dragon Fire, which had originally been intended to hold a sign, but the park management decided they liked it enough for it to be a standalone sculpture. Lishman was allowed to design it from scratch, as opposed to follow preset designs established before he was hired, taking him and assistant Richard Van Heuvelan two months to complete. The other main sculpture was the wild boar at Wild Beast, both this and the dragon being built at his home in Blackstock, Ontario, for about $75,000. Signs by Lishman included Sherwood Florist, Boo Boo's Buggys, an ice cream cone, and for a <b>popcorn</b> counter.|$|E
5|$|As {{the patrons}} leave due to not {{receiving}} a refund, the pictures going black {{when they were}} getting to important scenes, and complain about {{the taste of the}} <b>popcorn</b> (due to the mess the babies have made in the concession stand), Stu is angry at the fact that The Land Without Smiles went out at the climax. But at least they think that Tommy can go through a whole movie without any fuss. Because they didn't see the ending, Didi and Stu decide to go out to see the movie again next week, but at a different theater. As Grandpa Lou eats a candy bar in the back seat, Tommy takes notice of a flashing Reptar billboard as they drive by.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{the price}} of tickets had risen to $6 each, and <b>popcorn</b> was {{available}} for $1 per bag. Drinks, as well as brownies baked by Anthony Cacchio Jr., were also $1 each. The Theatre served as one of three screening locations for the Woodstock Film Festival, along with theaters in Rhinebeck and Woodstock. After years of resisting live entertainment, the Theatre allowed its stage {{to be used as}} a platform for a John Kerry rally on October26, 2004. It was the first time there had been such an event in the building in over 55years. By 2005, live performances were commonplace at the Theatre. The acoustics of the building also made it suitable for musical performances, beginning in autumn 2006 with a jazz performance by Kevin Mahogany.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in town, Mike meets up {{with his}} friends, the Terenzi {{brothers}} (Michael Siegel and Peter Licassi), and using the intercom on an ice cream truck, they drive around town attempting to warn people of the invading klowns. At Debbie's house, <b>popcorn</b> stuck to her clothes from her earlier encounter with the klowns mutates into monsters and attack her. She fends off the creatures, but another group of klowns arrive and trap her in a giant balloon. Mike, Dave, and the Terenzis witness Debbie's capture and give chase, following the klowns to an amusement park, and the relocated circus tent. Journeying through a funhouse leading to the klowns' lair, the Terenzi brothers become separated and meet two female-looking klowns. After Dave and Mike witness a klown using a crazy straw to drink liquefied townspeople, they rescue Debbie and flee into a maze full of tricks and traps.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{during its}} time under the {{ownership}} of Britain-based Grand Metropolitan, Burger King experimented with table service. After 4pm, customers would place their order at the counter, and their order would be brought to them at their table. Customers were given complimentary <b>popcorn</b> to eat while waiting for their meal. To coincide with the offering, a series of meals called the Dinner baskets were introduced. The dinner baskets included the Whopper Dinner Basket, Steak Sandwich Dinner Basket, Fried Chicken Dinner Basket, and Shrimp Dinner Basket. In the New England region of the United States, BK sold a Fried clam Basket. The dinner came with two sides, including a choice of a side salad, cole slaw, French fries, or baked potato. Lasting approximately a year, the sit-down restaurant concept was abandoned in 1994 {{in favor of the}} original quick-service formula.|$|E
5|$|In October 2014, a Man of Steel sequel was {{announced}} with an intended release between 2016 and 2020. In August 2015, Jon Schnepp revealed to DC Movie News on the <b>Popcorn</b> Network that the studio are {{rumored to have}} George Miller as the director for the sequel. In June 2016, Russel Crowe confirmed that a Man of Steel trilogy was originally planned before it was scrapped due to the announcement of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice In August 2016, The Wrap reports that the studio has announced that the sequel is now in development as a top priority for the studio and getting the character right for audiences is of tantamount importance. The news of a standalone Superman film were later confirmed by Dany Garcia, Henry Cavill's manager. While promoting Arrival, Amy Adams confirmed work has begun on the screenplay.|$|E
5|$|Mike and Dave witness {{one of the}} klowns using shadow puppets {{to shrink}} {{a crowd of people}} into the palm of its hand, then dump them into a sack of <b>popcorn,</b> {{revealed}} to be sentient creatures that eagerly gobble up the human prey. Back at the police station, Mooney is innundated with calls from townspeople reporting incidents with the klowns, but he dismisses all of them. Soon after, a klown arrives at the station and Mooney arrests it, believing it to be a teen prankster. Dave returns to the station to find two prisoners encased in cocoons, and the now escaped klown using a deceased Mooney as a ventriloquist's dummy. Dave shoots the klown several times before destroying its nose, which causes it to spin wildly and explode.|$|E
5|$|Mikoyan {{supported}} Stalin, whom he {{had first}} met in 1919, in the power struggle that followed Lenin's death in 1924; {{he had become a}} member of the Bolshevik Central Committee in 1923. As People's Commissar for External and Internal Trade from 1926, he imported ideas from the West, such as the manufacture of canned goods. In 1935 he was elected to the Politburo, and was among one of the first Soviet leaders to pay goodwill trips to the United States in order to boost economic cooperation. Mikoyan spent three months in the United States, where he not only learned more about its food industry but also met and spoke with Henry Ford and inspected Macy's in New York. When he returned, Mikoyan introduced a number of popular American consumer products to the Soviet Union, including American hamburgers, ice cream, corn flakes, <b>popcorn,</b> tomato juice, grapefruit, and corn on the cob.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} common trees that grow in the Big Butte Creek {{watershed}} include four species of fir, two species of pine, incense cedar, and western hemlock. The understory contains plants such as Pacific yew, Pacific madrone, chinquapin, and vine maple. Several invasive species {{have been reported in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, such as Kentucky bluegrass, common bent, drooping brome, and redtop. The spread of these species is most likely due to overgrazing. Sensitive species that grow in the watershed include Howell's yampah, Egg Lake monkeyflower, clustered lady's slipper, green-flowered ginger, Mount Mazama collomia, and Detling's microseris. Mallow and <b>popcorn</b> flower have also been discovered in riparian zones. The Poverty Flats Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) is home to several rare species of plants, including Bellinger's meadowfoam, Howell's yampah, and Rocky Mountain woodsia.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons {{drive to}} the park for a picnic but {{discover}} {{that it has been}} overrun by mosquitoes. While heading home, the family finds an Indian casino. Bart is turned away because of his age but is able to sneak in by hiding in ventriloquist Arthur Crandall's dummy case. During Crandall's performance at the casino, Bart bursts out of the case and gets caught by casino guards. He is sent to the casino manager's office, where the Native American manager shows him a vision of how his future will turn out if he does not change his ways. Thirty years into the future, Bart is a 40-year-old beer-drinking slacker trying to launch his music career after dropping out of the DeVry Institute, and has resorted to mooching off his parents and their neighbor Ned Flanders. The only gig Bart can get is at a beach bar owned by Nelson Muntz, and even then, Bart is only paid in <b>popcorn</b> shrimp.

Meanwhile, 38-year-old Lisa is the first straight female President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Carey driving up {{to a large}} movie theater, the Los Angeles Theatre in {{downtown}} Los Angeles, with several of her female friends. As they {{pull up to the}} front doors, they tell Carey that her boyfriend is inside with another woman, leading her to try to convince them to abort the plan of confrontation. After convincing her, they enter the theater and begin a series of small dance routines alongside some of the theater employees. As the music begins, scenes of them dancing and Carey entering the movie projection room inter-cut. Carey sits behind her boyfriend (played by Jerry O'Connell) and the woman he is cheating with, and spy on them in a comedic way with her female lackeys. Soon after, the still unidentified woman walks towards the bathroom, prompting Carey to follow her during a short interlude in the video. After running into each other by the washroom, the woman appears to be Carey sporting a short brown wig and red seductive clothing. Carey pokes her, starting a large brawl in between the two women. Afterwards, Carey appears to have defeated the woman named Bianca, and heads back towards the movie room. During this scene, Jay-Z's rap verse is played, while an animated clip of Jay-Z and Carey is projected onto the screen. Later a version of the video leaked where Jay-Z was rapping his verse in a jacuzzi. During the verse, Carey's friends begin throwing <b>popcorn</b> and other candies at O'Connell, prompting a small food fight in between them. As they halt their attack on him, Carey walks towards O'Connell's seat and acts as though she is Bianca. After she sits next to him and he notices who it is, Carey spills a large soda on his lap and bids him farewell, leaving the theater with her friends smiling.|$|E
25|$|A <b>popcorn</b> machine, {{also called}} a <b>popcorn</b> maker, is a device used to pop <b>popcorn.</b> Commercial <b>popcorn</b> {{machines}} are usually found in movie theaters and carnivals, producing <b>popcorn</b> of the oil-popped type, which has approximately 45% of its calories derived from fat. The first commercial <b>popcorn</b> machine {{was invented by}} Chicago resident Charles Cretors in 1885. His business that he founded, C. Cretors & Company, still to this day manufactures <b>popcorn</b> machines and other specialty equipment.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, Orville Redenbacher's namesake {{brand of}} <b>popcorn</b> was launched. In 1981, General Mills {{received}} the first patent for a microwave <b>popcorn</b> bag, with <b>popcorn</b> consumption seeing a sharp increase by {{tens of thousands}} of pounds in the years following.|$|E
25|$|<b>Popcorn</b> as {{a breakfast}} cereal was {{consumed}} by Americans in the 1800s and generally consisted of <b>popcorn</b> with milk and a sweetener.|$|E
25|$|<b>Popcorn</b> (1996) {{was adapted}} {{for the stage}} and went on a UK tour. It also toured Australia in a {{production}} starring Marcus Graham and Nadine Garner in its Eastern-States seasons. <b>Popcorn</b> won the TMA Barclays Theatre Award for new play and the Olivier Award for comedy. The Paris production of <b>Popcorn</b> ran {{for a year and}} was nominated for seven Moli√®re awards.|$|E
25|$|During the Great Depression, <b>popcorn</b> {{was fairly}} {{inexpensive}} at 5‚Äì10 cents {{a bag and}} became popular. Thus, while other businesses failed, the <b>popcorn</b> business thrived and became a {{source of income for}} many struggling farmers, including the Redenbacher family, namesake of the famous <b>popcorn</b> brand. During World War II, sugar rations diminished candy production, and Americans compensated by eating three times as much <b>popcorn</b> as they had before. The snack was popular at theaters, much to the initial displeasure of many of the theater owners, who thought it distracted from the films. Their minds eventually changed, however, and in 1938 a Midwestern theater owner named Glen W. Dickson installed <b>popcorn</b> machines in the lobbies of his theaters. The venture was a financial success, and the trend soon spread.|$|E
25|$|Producers {{and sellers}} of <b>popcorn</b> {{consider}} two major factors {{in evaluating the}} quality of popcorn: what percentage of the kernels will pop, and how much each popped kernel expands. Expansion is an important factor to both the consumer and vendor. For the consumer, larger pieces of <b>popcorn</b> tend to be more tender and are associated with higher quality. For the grower, distributor, and vendor, expansion is closely correlated with profit: vendors such as theaters buy <b>popcorn</b> by weight and sell it by volume. For both these reasons, higher-expansion <b>popcorn</b> fetches a higher profit per unit weight.|$|E
25|$|A <b>popcorn</b> bag is a {{specially}} designed, microwaveable bag that contains <b>popcorn,</b> along with oil, spices and seasoning. The bag is typically partially folded {{when it is}} placed in a microwave oven, and inflates {{as a result of}} steam pressure from the heated kernels. The earliest patent for the <b>popcorn</b> bag, U.S. patent #4,267,420 was filed on October 12, 1978 by William A. Brastad of Minneapolis and issued on May 12, 1981.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 TST {{added the}} popular <b>Popcorn</b> Theatre, theatre {{designed}} {{for children and}} performed by the adult company members. <b>Popcorn</b> Theatre has become a multi-generational adventure for many families {{and serves as a}} beautiful introduction to theatre.|$|E
