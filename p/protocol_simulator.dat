A communication channel may be wired, where there is a constrained physical connection between the transmitter and receiver, or wireless where the physical constraint is missing. Wired channels differ significantly from wireless channels which can change their state in very short time span and are thus unreliable in behaviour. Wireless network <b>protocol</b> <b>simulators</b> that operate at a packet level are computationally intensive and the addition of accurate channel fading models must add as little complexity as possible.

The synthetic ECG signal generated by the simulator can be used for testing and calibration of medical instruments, biomedical experiments and research in laboratories. The PTB diagnostic database collected from Physionet has been used as the standard database to generate ECG signal. This database has a sampling rate of 1 kHz. The ECG database is amplified and quantized in 8 -bit resolution. A MATLAB algorithm has been used to serially transmit the quantized ECG data using RS- 232 protocol to an 8051 based stand alone embedded system where it gets converted into 8 -bit parallel data and delivered to the digital to analog converter.

40|$|Simulation {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the verification of mobile wireless networking protocols. Recently several cities have either begun deploying or are completing plans to deploy large-scale urban mesh networks (LUMNets). On the other hand, the networking research community has little expertise in simulating such networks. While the protocols are simulated reasonably realistically, the propagation of wireless transmissions and the mobility of nodes are not. Today, simulations typically model propagation with either the free-space model or a &quot;two-ray&quot; model that includes a ground reflection. Such models are only valid in open space where there are no hills and no buildings. Since wireless signals at the frequencies used for mobile wireless networking are partly reflected off of buildings and partly is transmitted into the building, the presence of buildings greatly influences propagation. Consequently, the open-space propagation models are inaccurate in outdoor urban areas. Indoors, the open-space models are not even applicable. This paper presents guidelines for simulating propagation in such urban settings. Furthermore, extensive background discussion on propagation is also included. The techniques for propagation are validated against propagation measurements. The techniques discussed are implemented in a suite of tools that are compatible with <b>protocol</b> <b>simulators</b> and are freely available for use...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this master thesis we {{investigate}} to infer models of stan-dard communication protocols using automata learning techniques. One obstacle is that automata learning {{has been developed}} for machines with relatively small alphabets and a moderate number of states, whereas communication protocols usually have huge (practically infinite) sets of messages and sets of states. We propose to overcome this obstacle by defining an abstraction mapping, which reduces the alphabets and sets of states to finite sets of manageable size. We use an existing imple-mentation of the L * algorithm for automata learning to generate ab-stract finite-state models, which are then reduced in size and converted to concrete models of the tested communication protocol by reversing the abstraction mapping. We have applied our abstraction technique by connecting the Learn-Lib library for regular inference with the <b>protocol</b> <b>simulator</b> ns- 2, which provides implementations of standard protocols.
