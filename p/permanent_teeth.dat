5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} {{in humans}} {{is a process}} in tooth development in which the teeth enter the mouth and become visible. Current research indicates that the periodontal ligaments {{play an important role}} in tooth eruption. Primary teeth erupt into the mouth from around six months until two years of age. These teeth are the only ones in the mouth until a person is about six years old. At that time, the first permanent tooth erupts. This stage, during which a person has a combination of primary and <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth,</b> is known as the mixed stage. The mixed stage lasts until the last primary tooth is lost and the remaining <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> erupt into the mouth.|$|E

In all sloth lemurs, including Babakotia radofilai, the <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> erupted early, a trait seen in indriids that improves survivability of juveniles {{during the first}} dry season following weaning.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{development}} is the complex process by which teeth form from embryonic cells, grow, and erupt into the mouth. Although many diverse species have teeth, their {{development is}} largely {{the same as in}} humans. For human teeth to have a healthy oral environment, enamel, dentin, cementum, and the periodontium must all develop during appropriate stages of fetal development. Primary teeth start to form {{in the development of the}} embryo between the sixth and eighth weeks, and <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> begin to form in the twentieth week. If teeth do not start to develop at or near these times, they will not develop at all.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by orthodontists {{who wish to}} delay or speed up the eruption of certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth's</b> root reaches ⅓ of its total growth, the eruption of the <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth</b> will be delayed. Conversely, if {{the roots of the}} <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth</b> are more than ⅔ complete, the eruption of the <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth</b> will be accelerated. Between ⅓ and ⅔, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of eruption.|$|R

5|$|Toothache is {{the most}} common type of {{orofacial}} pain and, when severe, it is considered a dental emergency, since there may be a significant impact on sleep, eating, and other daily activities. It is one of the most common reasons for emergency dental appointments. Correct diagnosis can sometimes be challenging. The treatment of a toothache depends upon the exact cause, and may involve a filling, root canal treatment, extraction, drainage of pus, or other remedial action. The relief of toothache is considered one of the main responsibilities of dentists. In 2013, 223 million cases of tooth pain occurred as a result of dental caries in <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> and 53 million cases occurred in baby teeth. Historically, the demand for treatment of toothache is thought to have led to the emergence of dental surgery as the first specialty of medicine.|$|E
25|$|Mixed {{dentition}} starts {{when the}} first permanent molar appears in the mouth, usually at six years, and lasts until the last primary tooth is lost, usually at eleven or twelve years. <b>Permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> in the maxilla erupt in a different order from <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> on the mandible. Maxillary teeth erupt in the following order: (1) first molar (2) central incisor, (3) lateral incisor, (4) first premolar, (5) second premolar, (6) canine, (7) second molar, and (8) third molar. Mandibular teeth erupt in the following order: (1) first molar (2) central incisor, (3) lateral incisor, (4) canine, (5) first premolar, (6) second premolar, (7) second molar, and (8) third molar. Since there are no premolars in the primary dentition, the primary molars are replaced by permanent premolars. If any primary teeth are lost before <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> are ready to replace them, some posterior teeth may drift forward and cause space to {{be lost in the}} mouth. This may cause crowding and/or misplacement once the <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> erupt, which is usually referred to as malocclusion. Orthodontics may be required in such circumstances for an individual to achieve a straight set of teeth.|$|E

50|$|If Turner's {{hypoplasia}} {{is found}} in the front (anterior) area of the mouth, the most likely cause is a traumatic injury to a primary tooth. The traumatized tooth, which is usually a maxillary central incisor, is pushed into the developing tooth underneath it and consequently affects the formation of enamel. Because of the location of the <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth's</b> developing tooth bud in relation to the primary tooth, the most likely affected area on the <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth</b> is the facial surface (the side closer to the lips or cheek). White or yellow discoloration may accompany Turner's hypoplasia. Enamel hypoplasia may also be present.|$|R
25|$|In humans (and {{most other}} primates) {{there are usually}} 20 primary ("baby") teeth, 28 to 32 of what's known as <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth,</b> in {{addition}} to other four being third molars or wisdom teeth, each of {{which may or may not}} grow in.|$|E
25|$|Among primary teeth, 10 of {{them are}} usually found in the maxilla (i.e. upper jaw) and the other 10 in the {{mandible}} (i.e. lower jaw). Among <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth,</b> 16 {{are found in the}} maxilla and the other 16 in the mandible. Most of the teeth have uniquely distinguishing features.|$|E
25|$|The normal {{color of}} enamel varies from light yellow to grayish (bluish) white. At {{the edges of}} teeth {{where there is no}} dentin {{underlying}} the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue or translucent off-white tone, easily observable on the upper incisors. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. The enamel on primary teeth has a more opaque crystalline form and thus appears whiter than on <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth.</b>|$|E

25|$|Although tooth {{eruption}} occurs {{at different times}} for different people, a general eruption timeline exists. Typically, humans have 20 primary (baby) teeth and 32 <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth.</b> Tooth eruption has three stages. The first, known as deciduous dentition stage, occurs when only primary teeth are visible. Once the first permanent tooth erupts into the mouth, the teeth are in the mixed (or transitional) dentition. After the last primary tooth falls out of the mouth—a process known as exfoliation—the teeth are in the permanent dentition.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{dentition}} {{starts on}} {{the arrival of}} the mandibular central incisors, usually at eight months, and lasts until the first permanent molars appear in the mouth, usually at six years. The primary teeth typically erupt in the following order: (1) central incisor, (2) lateral incisor, (3) first molar, (4) canine, and (5) second molar. As a general rule, four teeth erupt for every six months of life, mandibular teeth erupt before maxillary teeth, and teeth erupt sooner in females than males. During primary dentition, the tooth buds of <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> develop below the primary teeth, close to the palate or tongue.|$|E
25|$|Most {{children}} with a form of clefting are monitored by a cleft palate team or craniofacial team through young adulthood. Care can be lifelong. Treatment procedures can vary between craniofacial teams. For example, some teams wait on jaw correction until the child is aged 10 to 12 (argument: growth is less influential as deciduous teeth are replaced by <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth,</b> thus saving the child from repeated corrective surgeries), while other teams correct the jaw earlier (argument: less speech therapy is needed than at a later age when speech therapy becomes harder). Within teams, treatment can differ between individual cases {{depending on the type}} and severity of the cleft.|$|E
40|$|Orofacial {{trauma is}} a serious orodental and general health problem that may have med-ical, {{esthetic}} and psychological consequences for children and their parents. When {{the root of the}} primary tooth is close to the unerupted <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth,</b> primary tooth trauma may result in developmental disturbances and pulpal reaction in that perma-nent tooth. We report an unusual case in which injury to the primary dentition resulted in developmental disturbances in the crown and the calcified structures in the pulp chamber of the <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth.</b> Localized malformation of the crown and enamel hypoplasia were treated with a light-cured composite resin restoration. We also discuss the formation of pulp calcification and the need for endodontic treatment. Dr. Altu...|$|R

40|$|Injury to an {{immature}} <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth</b> {{may result}} in cessation of dentin deposition and root maturation leaving an open root apex and thin dentinal walls that are prone to fracture. Endodontic treatment is often complicated and protracted with an uncertain prognosis frequently resulting in pre-mature tooth loss. There are several advantages of promoting apexogenesis in immature teeth with open apices. It encourages a longer and thicker root to develop thus decreasing the propensity of long term root fracture.

25|$|Cells {{from the}} dental {{follicle}} {{give rise to}} the periodontal ligament (PDL). Specific events leading {{to the formation of}} the periodontal ligament vary between deciduous (baby) and <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> and among various species of animals. Nonetheless, formation of the periodontal ligament begins with ligament fibroblasts from the dental follicle. These fibroblasts secrete collagen, which interacts with fibers on the surfaces of adjacent bone and cementum. This interaction leads to an attachment that develops as the tooth erupts into the mouth. The occlusion, which is the arrangement of teeth and how teeth in opposite arches come in contact with one another, continually affects the formation of periodontal ligament. This perpetual creation of periodontal ligament leads to the formation of groups of fibers in different orientations, such as horizontal and oblique fibers.|$|E
25|$|A growth {{center is}} located in the head of each mandibular condyle before an {{individual}} reaches maturity. This growth center consists of hyaline cartilage underneath the periosteum on the articulating surface of the condyle. This is the last growth center of bone in the body and is multidirectional in its growth capacity, unlike a typical long bone. This area of cartilage within the bone grows in length by appositional growth as the individual grows to maturity. Over time, the cartilage is replaced by bone, using endochondral ossification. This mandibular growth center in the condyle allows the increased length of the mandible needed for the larger <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth,</b> {{as well as for the}} larger brain capacity of the adult. This growth of the mandible also influences the overall shape of the face, and thus is charted and referred to during orthodontic therapy. When an individual reaches full maturity, the growth center of bone within the condyle has disappeared.|$|E
25|$|Six {{isolated}} <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> were found. They {{consisted of}} an upper lateral incisor, upper third premolar, upper fourth premolar, upper first molar, and an upper second molar, {{as well as}} 121 cranial fragments. All of the teeth found had complete crowns with developed roots. The varying size of the roots in each tooth {{make it difficult to}} determine if they are damaged, or the length they are because of development. It was determined that all of the pieces belonged to a 9-12-year-old juvenile. The sex of this particular fossil remains unknown. The teeth found have Neanderthal features, as some of them show Taurodontism, which is primarily found in the Neanderthal morphology. Studies of the pieces of cranium found are more ambiguous and harder to link to Neanderthals. The Parietal bone has a stronger likeness to anatomically modern humans, while other bones of the skull can be linked to Neanderthal craniums. Most researchers believe that this particular fossil is a Neanderthal because of the analysis of its dentition.|$|E
50|$|With {{the proper}} {{diagnostic}} assessment skilled timing and careful monitoring, programmed serial extraction procedures {{are capable of}} producing extensive amounts of <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth</b> translation. The earlier the first premolars are removed, the greater the distal eruption of the permanent canines.|$|R
50|$|Repair with {{cementum}} or dentin occurs after partial root resorption, fusing {{the tooth}} with the bone. It may occur following dental trauma, especially occlusal trauma, or after periapical periodontitis caused by pulp necrosis. Ankylosis {{itself is not}} a reason to remove a <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth,</b> however teeth which must be removed for other reasons are made significantly more difficult to remove if they are ankylosed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: The failure time of <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth</b> is of {{the form}} of {{interval}} censored since the exact time of tooth decay is not available {{and it is only}} known that tooth decay occurs between two consecutive visits. There are a few techniques available in the literature for the problem of goodness-of-fit for interval censored data. In this paper, we propose a new goodness-of-fit testing procedure for interval censored data and employ this for the failure time of the first <b>permanent</b> molar <b>tooth</b> (sixth tooth) data. Materials and Methods: Two methods of goodness-of-fit for interval censored data that are based on randomly generated data from each interval and averaging over the test statistics or over the p-values are employed for the failure time of the first <b>permanent</b> molar <b>tooth</b> data. Results: The mean of the failure time of the first <b>permanent</b> molar <b>tooth</b> is found to be at 95 months. The p-values of the two goodness-of-fit testing procedures for the Weibull, log-normal and gamma models are calculated. Conclusion: By comparing the p-values, the log-normal model is considered as the best model to describe the failure time of the first <b>permanent</b> molar <b>tooth</b> data. ...|$|R

500|$|A Russian Toy {{will often}} require {{the help of}} a {{veterinarian}} to remove any retained deciduous teeth (known as [...] "puppy teeth" [...] or [...] "baby teeth") that fail to fall out and make way for the <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth.</b> Without this intervention, usually done under anesthetic, the baby and <b>permanent</b> <b>teeth</b> will occupy the same socket in the jaw, which can cause tartar deposits, tooth decay, gingivitis and periodontitis, and can lead to premature loss of teeth.

50|$|There {{are some}} minor {{differences}} between the deciduous maxillary central incisor {{and that of the}} permanent maxillary central incisor. The deciduous tooth appears in the mouth at 8-12 months of age and shed at 6-7 years, and is replaced by the <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth</b> around 7-8 years of age. The <b>permanent</b> <b>tooth</b> is larger and is longer than it is wide. The maxillary central incisors contact each other at the midline of the face. The mandibular central incisors are the only other type of teeth to do so. The position of these teeth may determine the existence of an open bite or diastema. As with all teeth, variations of size, shape, and color exist among people. Systemic disease, such as syphilis, may affect the appearance of teeth.|$|R
