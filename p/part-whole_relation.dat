In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach to learning lexical patterns from online encyclopedia for extracting <b>part-whole</b> <b>relations.</b> The only input is a few part-whole instances. To tackle the term recognition problem, terms from the domain of the seeds are extracted taking use of the semantic information contained in the online encyclopedia. Instead of collecting sentences that contain relation instances from the seeds, we introduce a novel process to select sentences that may indicate <b>part-whole</b> <b>relations.</b> Patterns are produced from these sentences with terms replaced by Part and Whole tags. A similarity measurement based on a new edit distance is used and an algorithm is described to cluster similar patterns. We rank the pattern clusters according to their frequencies, and patterns from the top-k clusters are chosen to be applied to identify the new <b>part-whole</b> <b>relations.</b> Experimental results show that our method can extract abundant <b>part-whole</b> <b>relations</b> and achieve a preferable precision compared to the other state-of-the-art approaches...|$|R

In our account, parts and wholes are represented in distinct conceptual spaces; parts are joined to form wholes in a structure space. The structure space allows systematic similarity judgments between wholes, taking into consideration shared parts and their configurations. A point in the structure space denotes a particular part structure; regions in the space represent different general types of part structures. We argue that the structural space can represent prototype effects: structural types are formed around typical arrangements of parts. We also show how structure space captures the variations in part structure of a given concept across different domains. In addition, we discuss how some taxonomies of <b>part–whole</b> <b>relations</b> can be understood within our framework...|$|R

50|$|Mereotopology {{begins in}} {{philosophy}} with theories articulated by A. N. Whitehead in several {{books and articles}} he published between 1916 and 1929, drawing {{in part on the}} mereogeometry of De Laguna (1922). The first to have proposed the idea of a point-free definition of the concept of topological space in mathematics was Karl Menger in his book Dimensionstheorie (1928) -- see also his (1940). The early historical background of mereotopology is documented in Bélanger and Marquis (2013) and Whitehead's early work is discussed in Kneebone (1963: chpt. 13.5) and Simons (1987: 2.9.1). The theory of Whitehead's 1929 Process and Reality augmented the <b>part-whole</b> <b>relation</b> with topological notions such as contiguity and connection. Despite Whitehead's acumen as a mathematician, his theories were insufficiently formal, even flawed. By showing how Whitehead's theories could be fully formalized and repaired, Clarke (1981, 1985) founded contemporary mereotopology. The theories of Clarke and Whitehead are discussed in Simons (1987: 2.10.2), and Lucas (2000: chpt. 10). The entry Whitehead's point-free geometry includes two contemporary treatments of Whitehead's theories, due to Giangiacomo Gerla, each different from the theory set out in the next section.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{the domain}} of {{ontology}} design {{as well as in}} Conceptual Modeling, representing part-whole relations is a long-standing challenging problem. However, in most papers the focus has been on properties of the <b>part-whole</b> <b>relation,</b> rather than on its semantics. In the last decades, most approaches which have addressed the formal specification of the <b>part-whole</b> <b>relation</b> (i) rely on First Order Logic (FOL) which is unable to address multiple levels of granularity and (ii) do not support any typing mechanism useful for the extensional side of concepts and then, many difficulties remain especially about expressiveness.

To bridge this gap, we present an axiomatization of the <b>part-whole</b> <b>relation</b> which hold between typed terms.

40|$|International audienceThe chapter {{builds on}} Dobrovie-Sorin and Mari’s (2007 a,b) {{claim that the}} unacceptability of the generic {{readings}} of French plural indefinites headed by des ‘deplur’ {{is due to a}} constraint that prevents variables that range over elements ordered by the <b>part-whole</b> <b>relation</b> from being bound by a quantifier. This account is shown to extend to mass indefinites, bare plurals and German keine-indefinites. A careful characterization of plural symmetric nouns (neighbours, parallels) explains why such predicates allow for generic readings: the maximal groups that satisfy the relation denoted by the noun (neighbourhood, parallelhood) are not ordered by the <b>part-whole</b> <b>relation.</b> The chapter has two important theoretical consequences: (i) it restricts the possible analyses of generic bare plurals: they cannot be analyzed as indefinite-like expressions, but only as names of kinds; (ii) quantifiers over the mass domain cannot be assumed to denote relations between sets of portions of matter but rather relations between objects (maximal sums) ...|$|E
