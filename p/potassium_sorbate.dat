2500|$|Xango Juice is a {{blend of}} {{mangosteen}} aril and pericarp purée with juice concentrates of eight other fruits: apple, pear (juice and purée), grape, blueberry, raspberry, strawberry, cranberry and cherry. Other ingredients include citric acid, natural flavor, pectin, xanthan gum, sodium benzoate, and <b>potassium</b> <b>sorbate.</b> [...] Xango claims its juice contains xanthonoid compounds from the mangosteen pericarp.|$|E
2500|$|Geranium taint, as {{the name}} suggests, is a flavour and aroma taint in wine {{reminiscent}} of geranium leaves. The compound responsible is 2-ethoxyhexa-3,5-diene, which has a low sensory threshold concentration of 1ng/L. In wine it is formed during the metabolism of <b>potassium</b> <b>sorbate</b> by lactic acid bacteria. <b>Potassium</b> <b>sorbate</b> is sometimes added to wine as a preservative against yeast, however its use is generally {{kept to a minimum}} due to the possibility of the taint developing. The production of the taint begins with the conversion of sorbic acid to the alcohol sorbinol. The alcohol is then isomerised in the presence of acid to 3,5-hexadiene-2-ol, which is then esterified with ethanol to form 2-ethoxy-3,5-hexadiene. [...] Mannitol is usually produced in wines that undergo malolactic fermentation {{with a high level of}} residual sugars still present. Expert winemakers oftentimes add small amounts of sulfur dioxide during the crushing step to reduce early bacterial growth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>sorbate</b> is the {{potassium}} salt of sorbic acid, chemical formula CH3CH=CH−CH=CH−CO2K. It {{is a white}} salt that is very soluble in water (58.2% at 20 °C). It is primarily used as a food preservative (E number 202). <b>Potassium</b> <b>sorbate</b> is effective {{in a variety of}} applications including food, wine, and personal-care products. While sorbic acid is naturally occurring in some berries, virtually all of the world's production of sorbic acid, from which <b>potassium</b> <b>sorbate</b> is derived, is manufactured synthetically.|$|E

5000|$|Typical culinary usage {{rates of}} <b>potassium</b> <b>sorbate</b> are 0.025% to 0.1% (see sorbic acid), {{which in a}} 100 g serving yields an intake of 25 mg to 100 mg. The maximal {{acceptable}} daily intake for human consumption is 25 mg/kg, or 1750 mg daily for an average adult (70 kg). [...] Under some conditions, particularly at high concentrations or when combined with nitrites, <b>potassium</b> <b>sorbate</b> has shown genotoxic activity in vitro.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "wine stabilizer", <b>potassium</b> <b>sorbate</b> {{produces}} sorbic acid when added to wine. It serves two purposes. When active fermentation has ceased {{and the wine}} is racked for the final time after clearing, <b>potassium</b> <b>sorbate</b> renders any surviving yeast incapable of multiplying. Yeast living at that moment can continue fermenting any residual sugar into CO2 and alcohol, but when they die, no new yeast will be present to cause future fermentation. When a wine is sweetened before bottling, <b>potassium</b> <b>sorbate</b> is used to prevent refermentation when {{used in conjunction with}} potassium metabisulfite. It is primarily used with sweet wines, sparkling wines, and some hard ciders, but may be added to table wines, which exhibit difficulty in maintaining clarity after fining.|$|E

5000|$|Wheat flour, {{though not}} {{formerly}} used, {{is often used}} as an additional ingredient in the modern day, and <b>potassium</b> <b>sorbate</b> {{may be used as}} a preservative.|$|E
50|$|Although some {{research}} implies that <b>potassium</b> <b>sorbate</b> has a long-term safety record, {{in vitro studies}} have shown that it is both genotoxic and mutagenic to human blood cells. <b>Potassium</b> <b>sorbate</b> is found to be toxic to human DNA in peripheral blood lymphocytes, hence it negatively affects immunity. It is often used with ascorbic acid and iron salts, as they increase its effectiveness, but this tends to form mutagenic compounds that damage DNA molecules. Regardless, three studies have not found it to have any carcinogenic effects in rats.|$|E

50|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>sorbate</b> is {{produced}} industrially by neutralizing sorbic acid with potassium hydroxide. The precursor sorbic acid {{is produced}} in a two-step process via the condensation of crotonaldehyde and ketene.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{preservative}} used in winemaking is sulfur dioxide SO2, normally added {{in one of}} the following forms: liquid sulfur dioxide, sodium or potassium metabisulphite. Another useful preservative is <b>potassium</b> <b>sorbate.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that Campden tablets {{can be used to}} halt the ferment process in wine before all the available sugars are converted by the yeast, hence controlling the amount of residual sweetness in the final product. This however is not true. In order to halt fermentation, enough Campden tablets would have to be added to render the wine undrinkable. Alternatively, when used in conjunction with <b>potassium</b> <b>sorbate,</b> the yeast population will be greatly reduced and prevented from reproducing. Without the addition of <b>potassium</b> <b>sorbate</b> the yeast population will only be stunned and eventually repopulate if provided with enough fermentable sugars.|$|E

50|$|Unlike other {{sorbic acid}} salts such as <b>potassium</b> <b>sorbate</b> (E202) and calcium sorbate (E203), {{the use of}} sodium sorbate as a food {{additive}} is not allowed in the EU due to potential genotoxic effects.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>sorbate</b> is used {{to inhibit}} molds and yeasts in many foods, such as cheese, wine, yogurt, dried meats, apple cider, soft drinks and fruit drinks, and baked goods. Its {{breakdown}} to sorbitol, a sugar alcohol, {{has been shown to}} increase the chances of a bowel movement from eating prunes. It is used in the preparation of items such as hotcake syrup and milkshakes served by fast-food restaurants such as McDonald's. It can also be found in the ingredients list of many dried fruit products. In addition, herbal dietary supplement products generally contain <b>potassium</b> <b>sorbate,</b> which acts to prevent mold and microbes and to increase shelf life. It is used in quantities at which no adverse health effects are known, over short periods of time. Labeling of this preservative on ingredient statements reads as [...] "potassium sorbate" [...] or [...] "E202". Also, it is used in many personal-care products to inhibit the development of microorganisms for shelf stability. Some manufacturers are using this preservative as a replacement for parabens.
