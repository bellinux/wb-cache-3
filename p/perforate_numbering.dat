Canadian diplomatic missions abroad adopted this version in 2006. In March 2010, the passport was upgraded to include a new design of the identification page and more anti-counterfeit elements, such as the new colours of Optically Variable Ink and addition of laser <b>perforated</b> <b>number.</b> The cover, watermark, personalization technique and holographic laminate are same with the 2002 version. The 2010 version was also the last revision of MRP prior to the release of e-passports.|$|R

25|$|As of July 2015, the Philippine Passport {{is printed}} in Asian Productivity Organization or APO Productions under the Presidential Communications Group. On August 15, 2016, the new {{generation}} e-passport was released by the Department of Foreign Affairs with advanced security features such as the upgraded microchip to capture the personal data of the applicant, invisible ultraviolet (UV) fluorescent ink and thread, and elaborate design when subject to UV light. Security inks were also used to print the passports to prevent forgery. These inks include intaglio, which are visible inks that have a distinct ridged feel and ultraviolet ink that appears when exposed to infrared lights. Other security features include watermarks, <b>perforated</b> passport <b>numbering,</b> embedded security fibers, among others. Aside from making the new e-passport tamper-proof, each leaf of the 44-page document depicts Philippine artifacts, cultural icons, historic places, renowned tourist destinations, and even lyrics of the national anthem.|$|R
5000|$|The size of {{the shell}} varies between 18 mm and 40 mm. The solid, false-umbilicate shell has an elate-conic shape. The spire has nearly {{rectilinear}} outlines. The about 9 whorls are planulate, the body whorl is carinated. The sculpture of the upper surface consists of spiral series, four or five on each whorl, of regular, closely arranged granules, which are either rounded, bead-like, or laterally compressed. Upon the periphery of each whorl, there is a row of radiating, minutely <b>perforated</b> pustules, <b>numbering</b> on the body whorl 28. The base of the shell is concentrically sculptured with 6 to 7 concentric, densely granose lirae. It is slightly convex, radiately striped with brown or purplish. The color of the upper surface is whitish, broadly striped with red, purplish or brown. It is usually blue when rubbed. The aperture is lirate within on outer and parietal walls. The basal margin is concave, thick, and dentate within. The columella is oblique, plicate within and quadridentate. The white umbilical tract is biplicate.|$|R

The main condition was to preserve constant {{cross section of the}} holes in sum. Theoretical part of the thesis is focused on the basics of hydrodynamic cavitation and its practical usage in the industry. The experimental part of the paper deals with hydraulic characteristics of each shield <b>perforated</b> by varying <b>number</b> of orifices and also includes mutual comparison. Also high speed camera was used to detect the length of cavitation zone, although these results are not included in the conclusion of the thesis...|$|R
50|$|A {{colony of}} Atriolum robustum {{consists}} {{of a number of}} hollow, urn-shaped zooids up to 1.5 cm long, each with a large circular terminal hole, the atrial siphon, and connected by an encrusting base. The tunic (body wall) is firm to the touch and is <b>perforated</b> by a <b>number</b> of pore-like buccal siphons, each raised on a slight elevation, giving the zooid a pine cone-like appearance. The tunic contains a red pigment but the colour of this is often masked by the presence of yellowish-green cyanobacteria (Prochloron sp.) and may only be visible in the interior and at the rim of the atrial syphon. This sea squirt is sometimes confused with Didemnum molle but that species has a network of internal channels and exudes mucus, making it sticky to the touch.|$|R

Here were the lowest lodging houses in London, {{inhabited}} by the various classes of thieves common to large cities… were banded together… Because all are taken in who can pay their footing, the thief and the prostitute are harboured among those whose only crime is poverty, and there is thus always a comparatively secure retreat for him who has outraged his country's laws. Sums here are paid, a tithe of which, if well laid out, would provide at once a decent and an ample lodging for the deserving poor; and that surplus, which might add to the comfort and better {{the condition of the}} industrious, finds its way into the pocket of the middleman....|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} a multibody system is {{established}} to investigate the dynamic response of an oil tube-shock absorber-perforating gun system in downhole perforation-test joint operation. In the model, the oil tube and perforating gun are modeled as elastic rods and the shock absorber is modeled as single particle system with damping and a spring. Two force continuity conditions are used to simulate the interactions among the three components. The perforation impact load is determined by an experiment of underwater explosion of perforating bullets. Using the model, the effects of charge quantity of <b>perforating</b> bullet, the <b>number</b> of shock absorbers, {{and the length of}} oil tube on the dynamic response of oil tube and packer are investigated. On this basis, a basic principle of the combination design of shock absorber and oil tube is proposed to improve the mechanical state of downhole tools. The study results can provide theoretical support for the design of downhole perforation-test joint operation...|$|R
40|$|The {{breakup of}} a free thin liquid film {{subjected}} to an impulsive acceleration is investi-gated. A soap film is stretched on a frame at the exit of a shock tube. As the shock impacts the film, the film accelerates within {{a very short time}} and detaches from the frame at a constant velocity function of the shock strength. The liquid thickness modu-lations amplify and eventually the film is <b>perforated</b> with a <b>number</b> of holes, sub-sequently growing in radius and connecting to each other. The initially connex film is left {{in the form of a}} web of liquid ligaments which break into droplets. Both the hole density and formation time depend on the film velocity. We analyse these observations with an impulsive Rayleigh–Taylor instability incorporating liquid surface tension. It is shown to account for both the mode selection and its associated time of growth, providing a criterion for the film bursting time and hole density. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Petits-Chevaux, French for [...] "little horses", is a {{gambling}} game {{played with a}} mechanical device consisting of a board <b>perforated</b> with a <b>number</b> of concentric circular slits, in which revolve, each independently on its own axis, figures of jockeys on horseback, distinguished by numbers or colors. The bystanders having staked their money according to their choice on a board marked in divisions for this purpose, the horses are started revolving rapidly together by means of mechanism attached to the board, and the horse which stops nearest a marked goal wins, every player who has staked on that horse receiving so many times his stake. Figures of railway trains and other objects sometimes {{take the place of}} horses. In recent years there has been a tendency to supplant the petits chevaux at French resorts by the boule or ball game, on the same principle of gambling; in this a ball is rolled on a basin-shaped table so that it may eventually settle in {{one of a number of}} shallow cups, each marked with a figure.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Osteoporosis (OP) and {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) {{are public}} health diseases affecting {{the quality of}} life of the elderly, and bring about a heavy burden to the society and family of patients. It has been debated whether or not there is an inverse relationship between these two disorders. Methods To compare the exact difference in bone tissue structure between osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, we observed the ultrastructure of trabecular bone from the femoral heads using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A total of 15 femoral head specimens from postmenopausal women were collected during the procedures of total or hemi hip replacement (OP, n = 8; OA, n = 7). The morphologic structure of the trabecular bone, collagen fibers, resorption lacuna and osteoblasts were observed. Results Under SEM, osteoporotic trabeculae appeared to be thinning, tapering, breaking and <b>perforating.</b> A <b>number</b> of resorption lacunae of various shapes were seen on the surface of the trabeculum. The collagen fibers of lacuna were resorbed. On occasion, naked granular bone crystals could be found. In the OA group, the trabecular bone looked thick with integrated structure. Reticular and granular new bone could be found. The trabeculum was covered by well-arranged collagen fibers around the resorption lacuna. In the OP group, under TEM, marginal collagen fibers were observed to be aligned loosely with enlarged spaces. A few inactive osteoblasts and no inflammatory cells were seen. In the OA group, the collagen fibers inside the trabeculum were arranged in a dense manner with many active osteoblasts and inflammatory cells infiltrating the matrix. Conclusion We found significant differences in the trabecular bone, collagen fibers, lacunae and osteoblasts between postmenopausal women with OP and OA. These findings support the hypothesis that there is an inverse relationship between OP and OA. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Acute {{appendicitis}} is {{the most}} common acute surgical condition of the abdomen. The diagnosis of acute appendicitis continues to present clinicians with problems despite the advances in the investigating technology. This retrospective study aims to review appendiceal histopathological records in a district hospital in Makkah in 2007. The study was based on all appendices removed during emergency appendectomies to identify the proportion of normal and mildly inflamed appendices, in addition to their sex ratio, so that a prospective study can be carried out with conservative treatment with antibiotics, if justified. The records were divided into negative, mild and severely inflamed or <b>perforated</b> appendix. The <b>number</b> of the operations was 405, with nearly equal male and female ratio. The ratio of normal appendix was 24. 2 %, mild appendicitis was 26. 4 %, and severe appendicitis was 49. 4 %. Over 50 % of all emergency appendectomies were performed on normal or mildly inflamed appendix, which rises to over 60 % in females alone. The number of the males with severe appendicitis is nearly 50 % more than that of the females. Patients, especially females, with normal or mildly inflamed appendix, if identified before surgery, may benefit from conservative treatment with antibiotics...|$|R
40|$|Increasing use of {{barnacle}} giant {{muscle fibers}} for physiological research has prompted this investigation of their fine structure. The fibers are invaginated by a multibranched system of clefts connecting to the exterior {{and filled with}} material {{similar to that of}} the basement material of the sarcolemmal complex. Tubules originate from the surface plasma membrane at irregular sites, and also from the clefts They run transversely, spirally, and longitudinally, making many diadic and some triadic contacts with cisternal sacs of the longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum. The contacts are not confined to any particular region of the sarcomere. The tubules are wider and their walls are thicker at points of contact with Z material. Some linking of the Z regions occurs across spaces within the fiber which contain large numbers of glycogen particles. A-band lengths are extremely variable, in the range 2. 2 µm– 20. 3 µm (average 5. 2 µm) Individual thick filaments have thin (110 Å) hollow regions alternating with thick (340 Å) solid ones. Bridges between thick filaments occur at random points and are not concentrated into an M band The thin:thick filament ratio is variable in different parts of a fiber, from 3 : 1 to 6 : 1. Z bands are basically <b>perforated,</b> but the <b>number</b> of perforations may increase during contraction...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 8 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Mauritius, 11 - 13 July, 2011. A new method of obtaining flow resistance coefficient for perforated plates in low Reynolds number flows, such as natural air convection, was proposed. And some experimental values are obtained {{from the viewpoint of}} thermal design of electronic equipment casings where some perforations often used in the outlet and inlet vent to prevent dust from entering the casing. The proposed method is based on the two expressions written for the enthalpy balance and for the balance between aerodynamic resistance and buoyancy force in a ventilation model. By these two expressions, flow resistance coefficient values can be evaluated even when only dissipated power and temperature rise is known. As a result, the relationship of the flow resistance coefficient values for <b>perforated</b> plates, Reynolds <b>number</b> and porosity coefficient is presented in a form fitting for practical engineering use. 18 kinds of perforated plates have been used in this study and the range of Reynolds number defined by the hole diameter and the air velocity in the ventilation duct was from 0. 4 to 95. The experimental results include the Reynolds number and porosity coefficient influence on the resistance coefficient for perforated plates, as well as the perforated plates thickness to the diameter of hole effect on the flow resistance coefficient. mp 201...|$|R
40|$|Porous cell {{honeycomb}} liners {{for aircraft}} engine nacelles offer {{the possibility of}} exploiting extended reaction effects to improve liner attenuation bandwidth as generally attributed {{to the performance of}} bulk absorbers. This paper describes an analytical procedure, starting with an impedance prediction model for a single perforated plate, to estimate the bulk-absorber parameters for a cascade of such perforates - a first step to modeling a porous wall honeycomb structure. The objective is to build confidence in a lumped element impedance model, when applied to a uniformly-spaced set of porous plates to predict its. bulk. absorber properties. The model is based upon {{a modified version of the}} two-parameter flow resistance model of the form A + BV(sub inc), where A and B are physics-based, semi-empirical parameters that are adjusted to provide an optimum fit to a composite dataset from three plate porosities of 2. 5, 5 and 10 %. The composite dataset is achieved by reformulating the two-parameter flow resistance model into a. reduced pressure drop coefficient. dependency on <b>perforate</b> hole Reynolds <b>number.</b> The resulting impedance model is employed to calculate surface impedance spectra for N and 2 N-layer perforate cascades. The well-known two-thickness method for experimental determination of bulk-absorber parameters is then applied to these. synthesized. data sets to predict the characteristic impedance and propagation constant for the perforate cascades. These results are then compared with experimental results reported in a companion paper...|$|R
