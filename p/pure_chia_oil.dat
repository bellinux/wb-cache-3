40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of chia seed and <b>chia</b> <b>oil</b> on heat shock protein (HSP) and related parameters in diet-induced obese rats. Methods: Animals were divided in six groups: control, high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFF), and HFF with chia seed or <b>chia</b> <b>oil</b> in short (6 -wk) and long (12 -wk) treatments. Plasma indicators of glucose tolerance and liver damage, skeletal muscle expression of antioxidant enzymes, and proteins controlling oxidative energy metabolism were determined. The limit of significance was set at P < 0. 05. Results: The HFF diet induced glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and altered parameters related to obesity complications. The consumption of chia seed or <b>chia</b> <b>oil</b> did not reduce body weight gain or abdominal fat accumulation. However, chia seed and <b>chia</b> <b>oil</b> in both treatments improved glucose and insulin tolerance. <b>Chia</b> <b>oil</b> in both treatments induced expression of HSP 70 and HSP 25 in skeletal muscle. Short treatment with chia seed increased expression of HSP 70, but not HSP 25. <b>Chia</b> <b>oil</b> in both treatments restored superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase expression. Extended treatment with chia seed and short treatment with <b>chia</b> <b>oil</b> restored peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator- 1 alpha (PGC- 1 alpha) expression. Conclusion: <b>Chia</b> <b>oil</b> restored the antioxidant system and induced the expression of a higher number of proteins than chia seed. The present study demonstrated new properties and molecular mechanisms associated with the beneficial effects of chia seed and <b>chia</b> <b>oil</b> consumption in diet-induced obese rats.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{evaluate}} the oxidative stability of healthier lipid cooked meat systems (MS) in which pork backfat was replaced by a double emulsion (DE, W 1 /O/W 2) prepared with hydroxytyrosol (HXT) within an inner aqueous phase and <b>chia</b> <b>oil</b> as lipid phase. Physical characteristics of DEs and oxidative stability of DEs and MS during chilled storage were analysed. In DEs, which were highly stable, the presence of HXT improved oxidative stability, increasing (P < 0. 05) DPPH free radical scavenging and ferric reducing ability (FRAP) and reducing (P < 0. 05) levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). In MS, replacement of pork backfat by <b>chia</b> <b>oil</b> promoted lipid oxidation, which was more pronounced when <b>chia</b> <b>oil</b> was incorporated in the DE than when it was added in liquid form.

DEs with encapsulated riboflavin were subjected to conventional thermal treatment (70 °C for 30 min) and storage at 4 °C for 8 days to determine their influence on oil droplet particle size characteristics, viscosity, dynamic rheological properties, physical stability and encapsulation efficiency. The thermal treatment caused minimal changes in these parameters. DEs containing rendered pork backfat (DEsRPF) collapsed after 3 days of storage at 4 °C, thus limiting their useful life. For that reason samples of this DEsRPF were stored at room temperature only and proved stable throughout storage in those conditions.

Feed fortification with vitamin E or natural products like oregano essential <b>oil,</b> <b>chia</b> seed <b>oil,</b> and Spirulina platensis microalga appear promising in improving the oxidative stability of rabbit meat and increasing its healthiness. This review will attempt to outline several feeding strategies adopted to obtain rabbit meat with improved nutritional and dietetic properties and to offer an overview of the studies performed on the topic to date...|$|R

The consumption of fish, which is rich in n- 3 fatty acids, is low in Latin America and {{it is necessary to}} seek other alternatives, such as <b>chia</b> <b>oil</b> (CO) or rosa mosqueta oil (RMO), which are rich in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), the precursor of the n- 3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). This study evaluates the hepatic bioconversion of ALA to EPA and DHA and the damage to the liver (histology and transaminase) in Sprague-Dawley rats fed different vegetable oils. Four experimental groups (n = 9 animals each group) were fed the following dietary supplements for 21 days: a) sunflower oil (SFO), b) RMO, c) CO d) olive oil with fish oil added (EPA and DHA) (OO/FO). RMO and CO increased the hepatic levels of ALA, EPA and DHA and decreased the n- 6 /n- 3 ratio compared to SFO (p < 0. 05) without changes in the parameters of liver damage. It is concluded that CO and RMO may be nutritional alternatives for providing ALA for its bioconversion to EPA and DHA. FONDECYT, Chile 	 1090021 111004...|$|R
40|$|Different {{strategies}} were examined for incorporation of chia flour (10 %) {{and olive oil}} to improve the fat content in frankfurters. Nutritional composition, technological properties, sensory and microbiological analyses were studied as affected by the strategy used and by chilling storage. Chia increased total dietary fibre (98 % insoluble dietary fibre) and minerals (K, Mg, Ca, Mn) irrespective of the incorporation strategy. Fat and energy content reduction (>. 26 %) were achieved in all frankfurters reformulated with <b>chia</b> and olive <b>oil.</b> <b>Chia</b> addition increased linolenic acid and reduced processing and purge in all samples. Lightness and redness of frankfurters were affected {{by the presence of}} chia, but there was no clear evidence of influence by the mode of addition. Frankfurter texture was influenced by the strategy used to incorporate <b>chia</b> and olive <b>oil</b> and by chilling storage. Samples were judged acceptable and contained low microorganism levels. Frankfurters containing chia were suitable for labelling with certain nutrition and health claims.

40|$|Serratia marcescens {{produces}} several chit inol yt ic enzymes, including chit i nase A (ChiA) and chitinase B (ChiB). In this study, Chis was purified to homogeneity using a {{newly developed}} protocol based on hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Subsequently, characteristics of Chis {{and of the}} hitherto only partly characterized ChiA were determined and compared. <b>Pure</b> <b>ChiA</b> and Chis shared several characteristics such as a broad pH optimum around pH 5 - 0, and a temperature optimum between 50 and 60 OC. Both enzymes were fairly stable, with half-lives of more than 10 d at 37 "C, pH 61. Analyses of the degradation of various N-acetylglucosamine oligomers, f luorogenic substrates and colloidal chitin showed that both enzymes cleave chitobiose [(GlcNAc),] from (GlcNAc), and thus possess an exolN,N'diacetylchitobiohydrolase activity. Both enzymes were also capable of producing monomers from longer (GlcNAc), substrates, indicating that they also have an endochitinase (ChiA) or exo-N,N',N''-triacetylchitotriohydrolase (ChiB) activity. Kinetic analyses with ~methylumbelliferyl-~D-N,N'd iacet y Ich i to bioside, an analogue of (GlcN Ac), showed cooperative kinetics for ChiA, whereas for Chis normal hyperbolic kinetics were observed. ChiA had a higher specific activity towards chitin than Chis and synergistic effects on the chitin degradation rate were observed upon combining the two enzymes. These results, together {{with the results of}} sequence comparisons and previous studies of the cellular localization of the two chitinases in S. marcescens indicate possible roles for ChiA and ChiB in chitin breakdown...|$|R

50|$|Currently, {{no major}} pests or {{diseases}} affect <b>chia</b> production. Essential <b>oils</b> in <b>chia</b> leaves have repellant properties against insects, making it suitable for organic cultivation.

50|$|The diet {{of laying}} hens {{can affect the}} {{nutritional}} quality of eggs. For instance, chicken eggs that are especially high in omega-3 fatty acids are produced by feeding hens a diet containing polyunsaturated fats from sources like fish <b>oil,</b> <b>chia</b> seeds or flaxseeds. Pasture-raised free-range hens, which forage for their own food, also produce eggs that are relatively enriched in omega-3 fatty acids compared to cage-raised chickens.|$|R
40|$|Alpha-linolenic acid (C 18 : 3 n- 3, ALA) is an {{essential}} fatty acid and the metabolic precursor of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) from the n- 3 family with relevant physiological and metabolic roles: eicosapentaenoic acid (C 20 : 5 n- 3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (C 22 : 6 n- 3, DHA). Western diet lacks of suitable intake of n- 3 LCPUFA and there are recommendations to increase the dietary supply of such nutrients. Seed oils rich in ALA such as those from rosa mosqueta (Rosa rubiginosa), sacha inchi (Plukenetia volubis) and chia (Salvia hispanica) may constitute an alternative that merits research. This study evaluated hepatic and epididymal accretion and biosynthesis of n- 3 LCPUFA, the activity and expression of Delta- 5 and Delta- 6 desaturase enzymes, the expression and DNA-binding activity of PPAR-alpha and SREBP- 1 c, oxidative stress parameters and the activity of antioxidative enzymes in rats fed sunflower oil (SFO, 1 % ALA) as control group, canola oil (CO, 10 % ALA), rosa mosqueta oil (RMO, 33 % ALA), sacha inchi oil (SIO, 49 % ALA) and <b>chia</b> <b>oil</b> (ChO, 64 % ALA) as single lipid source. A larger supply of ALA increased the accretion of n- 3 LCPUFA, the activity and expression of desaturases, the antioxidative status, the expression and DNA-binding of PPAR-alpha, the oxidation of fatty acids and the activity of antioxidant enzymes, whereas the expression and DNA-binding activity of SREBP- 1 c transcription factor and the biosynthetic activity of fatty acids declined. Results showed that oils rich in ALA such as SIO and ChO may trigger metabolic responses in rats such as those produced by n- 3 PUFA. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Spray dried <b>chia</b> seed <b>oil</b> (CSO) microcapsules were {{prepared}} by using chia seed protein isolate (CPI), chia seed gum (CSG) and CPI-CSG complex coacervate as shell materials. Release and digestion behaviours of CSO from above capsules were studied. The release and lipolysis of CSO from these microcapsules in simulated oral, gastric and intestinal conditions {{were found to}} depend on shell composition. Oil release was negligible in oral stage, was highest in gastric stage due to hydrolysis of CPI and subsequent erosion of shell structure. Lipolysis of oil occurred only in the intestinal stage due {{to the presence of}} pancreatic lipase. Almost all the unencapsulated oil was hydrolysed, whereas only 60 % of the oil encapsulated in CPI-CSG shell was hydrolysed during in vitro digestion. Thus, CPI-CSG complex coacervate was found to be suitable for delivery of CSO to intestinal stage of digestion...|$|R
50|$|The lacquer {{process begins}} with sanding the piece well, then adding {{a coat of}} varnish made from chia seed and mineral oils, making his own <b>chia</b> seed <b>oil</b> using {{traditional}} methods. Then the piece is burnished completely with a smooth stone. Colors are made with minerals, anilines and other materials obtained locally.

He does not use stencils nor repeats designs exactly, creating his works spontaneously, using brushes made from bird feathers or cat hair because they allow for fine lines. When gold or silver leaf is used, it is applied in fine sheets and then burnished and can be used as the background and painted over.

The specific gravity, viscosity and refractive index of CSO {{at ambient temperature}} were 0. 93, 43. 2 mPa. s and 1. 48, respectively. The acid, peroxide, saponification and iodine values and unsaponifiable matter content of CSO were 2. 54 g KOH/kg oil, 4. 33 meq O 2 /kg oil, 197 g KOH/kg oil, 204 g I 2 /kg oil and 1. 12 %, respectively. α-linolenic acid is the most abundant fatty acid comprising (64. 39 % of total oil) followed by linoleic acid (21. 46 %), while saturated fatty acid content is less than 10 %. This CSO contained twelve triacylglycerols (TAGs) out of which trilinolenin (αLnαLnαLn) was the most abundant comprising 33. 2 % of total TAG. Melting point and melting enthalpy of CSO were - 34 °C and 77. 48 J/g, respectively. CSO remained stable up to 300 °C with negligible degradation.

30|$|In {{the food}} industry, the {{microencapsulation}} {{process can be}} used for a variety of reasons, which have been summarized by Desai and Park [4] as follows: (a) the core material is protected from degradation by reducing its responses to the external environment; (b) the evaporation or transfer rate of the main material to the external environment is decreased; (c) the physical characteristics of the original material is modified to allow easier handling; (d) the release of the core material is tailored to occur slowly over time or at a particular time; (e) the unwanted flavors or tastes of the core material are masked; (f) equal dispersion in the keeper material is achieved; and (g) the mixture components that would otherwise react with one another are separated. These applications are also suitable for oil nanoencapsulation. Ricaurte et al. [10] and Campo et al. [37] studied high-oleic palm <b>oil</b> (HOPO) and <b>chia</b> seed <b>oil</b> with different aims.
