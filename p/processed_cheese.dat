25|$|In many dairy industries, salt {{is added}} to cheese as a color-, fermentation-, and texture-control agent. The dairy subsector {{includes}} companies that manufacture creamery butter, condensed and evaporated milk, frozen desserts, ice cream, natural and <b>processed</b> <b>cheese,</b> and specialty dairy products. In canning, salt is primarily added as a flavor enhancer and preservative. It also {{is used as a}} carrier for other ingredients, dehydrating agent, enzyme inhibitor and tenderizer. In baking, salt {{is added to}} control the rate of fermentation in bread dough. It also is used to strengthen the gluten (the elastic protein-water complex in certain doughs) and as a flavor enhancer, such as a topping on baked goods. The food-processing category also contains grain mill products. These products consist of milling flour and rice and manufacturing cereal breakfast food and blended or prepared flour. Salt is also used a seasoning agent, e.g. in potato chips, pretzels, cat and dog food.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma work is to characterise <b>processed</b> <b>cheeses</b> {{and their}} analogues, to {{identify}} and quantify aroma active substances in the samples of cheese analogues, to evaluate their flavour using selected sensory methods and to compare the acquired results with the flavour of corresponding classic cheeses. The theoretical part is focused on general characteristic, classification, production technology of the <b>processed</b> <b>cheeses</b> and their analogues and {{on the list of}} aroma active substances occurring in cheeses. Furthermore, the summary of the methods suitable for sensory and analytic evaluation of cheese flavour and for the isolation of aroma active substances is given here. The samples of cheese analogues were made in Tomas Bata University in Zlín from coconut fat, butter, palm fat, milk fat and sunflower-seed oil. The classic <b>processed</b> <b>cheeses</b> were acquired commercially in the chain-store Billa. The aromatic substances were isolated and quantified using SPME-GC method, the fibre with the polar stationary phase CARTM/PDMS was used. Overall, 44 aroma substances were assessed: 9 aldehydes, 17 alcohols, 3 esters, 10 ketones and 5 acids. Classic <b>processed</b> <b>cheeses</b> contained the largest amount of aroma substances, Edam cheese, used for the production of cheese analogues, the smallest. Aroma compounds found in cheese analogues were then compared with raw materials used (Edam cheese and various fats), with the analogues produced last year and with classic <b>processed</b> <b>cheeses.</b> Finally, the results of the SPME-GC method and the sensory analysis were compared.

40|$|Mentor: Tonya SchoenfussProcess {{cheese is}} {{manufactured}} by blending continuously and heating {{one or more}} types of natural cheese {{in the presence of}} emulsifying salts and other nondairy ingredients to form a homogenous plastic mass. Although the process produces a product with extended shelf life and numerous enduse applications, the sodium content of the final product also increases. Therefore, <b>process</b> <b>cheese</b> is used {{in a wide variety of}} food products, widely consumed and often contribute to hypertension and other related disease. The objective of this research was to reduce the sodium content in <b>process</b> <b>cheese</b> and to examine the textural properties as well as consumers’ acceptance on reduced sodium <b>process</b> <b>cheese.</b> Four different treatments of <b>process</b> <b>cheeses</b> were manufactured at different sodium level (full sodium control, 18 %, 26 % and 44 % reduction of sodium) using a Thermomix TM 31, a food blender and processer. The samples were then tested for their chemical components. The textural characteristics of the <b>process</b> <b>cheese</b> were analyzed by Texture Profile Analysis (TPA) and meltability test and also surveyed for consumer acceptance and sensory perception. The chemical components of all the different treatments were similar and did not contribute significantly to the texture and meltability of <b>process</b> <b>cheese.</b> TPA results showed that the full sodium control and 18 % sodium reduction gives more firmness to the cheese as their average hardness were greater than the 26 % and 44 % sodium reduction. Meltability test showed that as the 26 % and 44 % reduction of sodium produced cheese with higher meltability than the full sodium control and 18 % sodium reduction. Sensory analysis also showed that as the amount of sodium in cheese was reduced, the resulting products were less firm and the amount of work required to chew the <b>process</b> <b>cheese</b> was less. Sensory results showed that the saltiness level of the 44 % sodium reduction was the highest and the full sodium control was the lowest. The sensory panelists failed to notice the difference in saltiness as the sodium content in <b>process</b> <b>cheese</b> was reduced. It also showed that highest value of off-flavors increases as the percentage of sodium reduction is higher.

2500|$|As {{with the}} {{invention}} of the hamburger, the exact origins of the cheeseburger are unknown. Several chefs claim to have been the first to add a slice of cheese to a hamburger. Lionel Sternberger of Rite Spot in Pasadena, California takes credit for the cheeseburger, claiming that he invented it between 1924 and 1926. A description from a 1928 menu from the O'Dell Restaurant in Los Angeles reveals that it was serving burgers with slices of cheese at the time. Luis Ballast, owner of the Humpty Dumpty drive-in restaurant in Denver, Colorado, made an attempt to create a cheeseburger with a registered trademark known as a [...] "yellowburger" [...] in 1935. J.C. Reynolds, the operator of a bar in Southern California from 1932 to 1984, popularized a pimento burger. <b>Processed</b> <b>cheese,</b> the type of cheese most used in cheeseburgers, was invented in 1911 by Walter Gerber of Thun, Switzerland, although the first U.S. patent awarded for it was given to James L.
