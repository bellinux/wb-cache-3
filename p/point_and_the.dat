5|$|Above the {{mounting}} platform was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected to}} a wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting point {{at the tip of}} the wedge. The rear part of the reflector sight was mounted at this <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> opposite end was supported by a rotating pintle inserted into a gudgeon mounted to the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting light off the reflector in the center, motion of the mirror would result in twice the motion of the aim point. To address this, the gyro was attached through levers with a 2-to-1 reduction.|$|E

After Paradise Point Road, the highway follows a winding, southeasterly course along Tupper Lake, passing little more than dense forests while crossing over the Bog River near its mouth.

5|$|Cunningham was {{promoted}} to acting squadron leader in September 1940, commanding B Flight. Within the month the unit received the heavily armed and powerful Bristol Beaufighter. After the commanding officer, Cunningham was the second man to fly it. The Beaufighter went through a teething stage in relation to its gun sight. The sight projected a ring of light with a spot at the centre onto a small sheet of glass {{directly in front of}} the pilots head. The spot in the centre provided the aiming <b>point,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ring, of variable diameter, helped him to judge the rage and amount of deflection needed to attack a target. The light's brilliance was adjustable by rheostat, but the control was ineffective. Rotating it a fraction could produce maximum brilliance or cause the spot to flicker out.|$|E
