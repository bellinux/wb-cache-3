The aim of this paper was to evaluate the concept of PIvap for a existing hardwood mill producing kraft pulp and compare the results with the ones from an earlier study of a softwood model mill. Using <b>pinch</b> <b>tools,</b> we found a solution where 1. 3 GJ/ADt of pinch violations are solved and 1. 1 GJ/ADt of excess heat is extracted. If the excess heat is used in an efficient PIvap, steam savings of 2. 7 GJ/ADt could be made in the evaporation plant. Together with the pinch violations and improved soot blowing, the total steam savings were 4. 6 GJ/ADt or 36 % for an investment cost of 6. 6 M€. Compared with the softwood model mill, the configuration of the hardwood mill offered about the same savings with 2. 7 M€ lower investment cost, making PIvap more interesting in the hardwood mill. As an alternative to implementing PIvap, more pinch violations can be solved. The PIvap approach gives more steam savings to approximately the same specific cost...|$|R

40|$|A larger part of {{the cooling}} and heating demand in a {{renewable}} fuels plant is accomplished by using air-cooling and steam in several alternating steps. This study examine what opportunities there are for energy efficiency improvements on site, {{in order to reduce}} the electricity and fuel consumption in the plant. The evaluation was done by using <b>pinch</b> <b>tools</b> on three different case studies: theoretical case based on technical specifications, operational case based on averaged measurements from the process and the adjusted operational case with changed temperature targets respectively. The investigated cases had total heating demands of 18. 7 MW, 20. 0 MW and 19. 2 MW and total cooling demands of 20. 4 MW, 18. 9 MW and 17. 7 MW respectively. Results from the pinch analysis of the theoretical case indicated that there were three ways to improve energy efficiency in the plant: by removal of pinch rule violations, by optimizing the temperature level at which utility was supplied or increasing methanol condensation temperatures in an integrated HEN (i. e. raising saturation pressure). Actual temperatures and flows in the operational case were analysed. By changing target temperatures the plant could save 2 123 kW of energy, both from heating and electricity. Assuming the operation would be adjusted accordingly, the adjusted operational case was created. On this case the full pinch analysis with retrofit suggestions was performed, as well as investigating the full potential of optimizing hot utility levels and condensing methanol at a higher temperature. By performing a retrofit of the existing HEN, 1 517 kW can be heat integrated. This would save the plant 5. 54 MSEK annually in reduced utility costs. By heating the two flows entering the reactors with MP steam before using HP steam, 5 100 kW could be saved. This shift of hot utility level would save the plant 3. 74 MSEK annually in reduced steam costs. By building two new flashing steps at 8 bar, which would supply condensing methanol at 135 ºC, approximately 2 194 kW would become available. If integrated in such a way that it could replace the corresponding load in MP steam, 15. 5 MSEK in eliminated steam costs would be saved annually. It was recommended that options for flashing methanol at intermediate pressures, combined with a new retrofit investigation, would be the best alternative to investigated further...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{targeting}} and optimal utility placement {{are among}} the key steps in the cost-effective design of a process utility system. Composite Curves (CCs) and Grand Composite Curves (GCCs) are the popular <b>Pinch</b> Analysis <b>tools</b> for multiple utility targeting and placement. Although the CCs and GCCs can provide useful insights and yield acceptable utility targets, {{they could not be}} used to design a heat recovery network and to perform heat allocation involving the process and utility system. The Stream Temperature versus Enthalpy Plot (STEP) that was introduced in 2010 has the ability to overcome these limitations. Apart from giving the pinch points and energy targets, STEP can also graphically represent the maximum heat allocation (MHA) that can be converted into a maximum energy recovery (MER) network on a temperature versus enthalpy diagram. STEP has also been used for targeting closed-loop utilities having fixed supply and return temperatures that include steam, hot oil, refrigerants and cooling water circuits. However, the available STEP technique is unable to handle cases involving the "once-through" utility such as flue gas where the target temperature and flowrate needs to be simultaneously optimised in order to minimise fuel consumption.

When drying biofuel, {{a large amount}} of the heat input can often be recovered. One option for heat recovery is to cover low-temperature heat demand in the pulping process. Alternatively available excess heat from the pulp mill can be used for drying. Both alternatives will contribute to a better energy efficiency for the combined pulp mill and biofuel upgrading facility. <b>Pinch</b> analysis <b>tools</b> can be used to estimate the excess heat potential at different temperature levels in the pulp mill. Three different technologies for pulp mill integrated biofuel drying were chosen for the study, namely steam drying, flue gas drying and vacuum drying.

The pulp mill assumed for the calculations is the Eco-Cyclic reference pulp mill. The results of the study indicate that the most attractive integrated drying technology option is the flue gas dryer, using flue gases from the black liquor boiler. With the available flue gas stream at the reference pulp mill, a potential pellets production of 70, 000 ton/yr could be achieved at a cost of 24. 6 EUR/ton.

The work is based on process models established in Aspen Plus to obtain mass and energy balances. Heat recovery targets for integration of a steam network for combined heat and power production are investigated using <b>pinch</b> analysis <b>tools.</b> The different process alternatives are compared in terms of energy efficiency (?en). Additionally, to identify key process differences, the cold gas efficiency (?cg,i) and carbon conversion (Cconv,i) from biomass feedstock to various intermediate products along the process value chain are compared. The results show that light olefins could be produced with an energy efficiency of approximately 52 – 54 % (higher heating value (HHV) basis) using methanol and DME as platform chemicals. The two investigated concepts had similar cold gas efficiency along the process value chain and overall electricity balance. Accordingly, no significant thermodynamic difference could be identified for the two investigated cases. One interesting feature that is identified is that the same amount of the renewable carbon in the feedstock is lost, mainly as CO 2, regardless of whether the methanol or DME route is adopted.

40|$|Increasing {{utilization}} of industrial excess heat {{is an important}} step towards reaching EU targets for increased energy efficiency and decreased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. There are many options for harnessing excess heat. However, the corresponding impact on GHG emissions differ significantly depending on the assumed marginal production technology replaced in the surrounding energy system. In order to identify robust solutions and avoid sub-optimization, different possibilities for utilizing excess heat need to be compared and evaluated using a systems perspective with different future energy markets scenarios. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate and compare different utilization options in terms of GHG emission reduction potential. The paper presents an illustrative case of a large modern refinery on the West Coast of Sweden with a crude oil capacity of 11. 4 Mt crude/y. The potential for producing electricity with an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), delivering excess heat to a district heating (DH) network and using it for post combustion carbon capture (CCS) are quantified using <b>pinch</b> analysis <b>tools.</b> Consequences for GHG emissions are evaluated based on different assumptions for future grid marginal electricity production. The results indicate that the GHG emission reduction potential is larger for CCS and DH than for electricity production via ORC.

The assumed SNG process configuration {{is similar to that}} selected for the ongoing Gothenburg Biomass Gasification demonstration project (GoBiGas) and is modelled in Aspen Plus. The heat and power integration potentials are investigated using <b>Pinch</b> Analysis <b>tools.</b> Three cases have been investigated: the steam production potential from the SNG process excess heat, the electricity production potential by maximizing the heat recovery in the SNG process without additional fuel firing, and the electricity production potential with increased steam cycle efficiency and additional fuel firing. The results show that 217 MWLHV of woody biomass are required to substitute the site’s natural gas demand with SNG (162 MWLHV). The results indicate that excess heat from the SNG process has the potential to completely cover the site’s net steam demand (19 MW) or to produce enough electricity to cover the demand of the SNG process (21 MWel). The study also shows {{that it is possible to}} fully exploit the heat pockets in the SNG process Grand Composite Curve (GCC) resulting in an increase of the steam cycle electricity output. In this case, there is a potential to cover the site’s net steam demand and to produce 30 MWel with an efficiency of 1 MWel/MWadded heat. However, this configuration requires combustion of 36 MWLHV of additional fuel, resulting in a marginal generation efficiency of 0. 80 MWel/MWfuel (i. e. comparing the obtained electricity production potentials with and without additional fuel firing) ...|$|R

The investigation is conducted for a plant currently processing 175 MW [higher heating value (HHV) basis] of natural gas (NG) annually. Two concepts {{based on the same}} gasification technology are considered: (i) replacing the NG feedstock with biomass-derived synthetic NG (bio-SNG); (ii) replacing syngas with biomass-derived syngas. The work is based upon process models established in Aspen Plus in order to obtain mass and energy balances. Heat recovery opportunities by means of production of useful thermal heat and integration of a steam network for combined heat and power production are investigated using <b>pinch</b> analysis <b>tools.</b> Two different ways of harnessing the high-temperature excess heat are investigated: (i) maximization of the power production; (ii) low-pressure (LP) steam (co) production for process heating to reduce or entirely cover the steam demand of the oxo synthesis plant, which is currently produced by firing of purchased fuel gas. The different process alternatives are compared in terms of energy efficiency (eta(en)) and exergy efficiency (eta(ex)). The results show that around 262 MW (HHV basis) of lignocellulosic biomass is required to fully substitute for the NG feedstock with bio-SNG. The biomass input can be reduced to 216 MW (HHV basis) if the required syngas is produced directly from gasified biomass, thus avoiding the intermediate SNG synthesis step. The direct syngas route achieves the highest thermodynamic performance of the biorefinery concepts investigated, especially if LP steam is exported to the oxo synthesis plant (eta(en) = 75 % and eta(ex) = 57 %, i. e., 9. 1 and 7. 2 efficiency points higher than for the route via bio-SNG, respectively) ...|$|R

The project {{has been focused on}} the targeting and on the optimization of indirect heat recovery through storage; these domains are particularly relevant to food industry (e. g. breweries, dairies, etc.), as well as for buildings. The targeting of batch processes has {{to deal with the problem}} of heat exchangers utilised across time slices, reducing the investments costs. To minimize these costs, one has to maximise the common exchange area; this objective is reached extending the methodology developed by other authors for the multiple base cases (MBC) problem. Some limitations of this methodology have been identified and improvements proposed. Unlike rescheduling which is often not possible, heat storage is mainly limited by cost considerations; therefore, major steps of a methodology to quickly assess its profitability have been established in this project. The batch cascade curves are used in an extended form (including some particular pockets) to select the storage parameters (type, operating temperatures), while the new concept of incremental cost determines the contribution of each time slice to the heat tranfered by each storage. The latter variables are the optimized to minimize the total yearly cost. Batch processes can now be tackled using PinchLENI, the process integration software developed at our laboratory.

The mill has two power boilers in addition to the recovery boiler, one oil boiler and one bark boiler. The bark boiler is fired with both bark from the mill’s own debarking and purchased bark. The oil boiler has the highest marginal operating costs, thus a reduced steam demand will decrease usage of the oil boiler. By identifying the pinch violations in the system one can identify potential measures for increasing internal heat exchanging. Four alternatives with different degrees of heat recovery have been identified. For these cases the investment costs have been calculated and the technical consequences considered. The calculations were carried out for winter operation. Two cases were considered for potential fuel savings: oil fuel and bark fuel.
