5|$|There {{are about}} fifty blue <b>point-like</b> {{objects in the}} HDF. Many seem to be {{associated}} with nearby galaxies, which together form chains and arcs: these are likely to be regions of intense star formation. Others may be distant quasars. Astronomers initially ruled out the possibility that some of the <b>point-like</b> objects are white dwarfs, because they are too blue to be consistent with theories of white dwarf evolution prevalent at the time. However, more recent work has found that many white dwarfs become bluer as they age, lending support to the idea that the HDF might contain white dwarfs.|$|E
5|$|Photons, {{like all}} quantum objects, exhibit wave-like and particle-like properties. Their dual wave–particle nature can be {{difficult}} to visualize. The photon displays clearly wave-like phenomena such as diffraction and interference on the length scale of its wavelength. For example, a single photon passing through a double-slit experiment exhibits interference phenomena but only if no measure was made at the slit. A single photon passing through a double-slit experiment lands on the screen with a probability distribution given by its interference pattern determined by Maxwell's equations. However, experiments confirm that the photon is not a short pulse of electromagnetic radiation; it does not spread out as it propagates, nor does it divide when it encounters a beam splitter. Rather, the photon seems to be a <b>point-like</b> particle since it is absorbed or emitted as a whole by arbitrarily small systems, systems much smaller than its wavelength, such as an atomic nucleus (≈10−15 m across) or even the <b>point-like</b> electron. Nevertheless, the photon is not a <b>point-like</b> particle whose trajectory is shaped probabilistically by the electromagnetic field, as conceived by Einstein and others; that hypothesis was also refuted by the photon-correlation experiments cited above. According to our present understanding, the electromagnetic field itself is produced by photons, which in turn result from a local gauge symmetry and the laws of quantum field theory (see the Second quantization and Gauge boson sections below).|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} the radius of the {{electron}} is a challenging problem of the modern theoretical physics. The admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius of the electron is incompatible to the premises {{of the theory of}} relativity. On the other hand, a <b>point-like</b> electron (zero radius) generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the self-energy of the electron tending to infinity.|$|E
5|$|In physics, {{string theory}} is a {{theoretical}} framework in which the <b>point-like</b> particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. These strings look like small segments or loops of ordinary string. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. Splitting and recombination of strings correspond to particle emission and absorption, giving rise to the interactions between particles.|$|E
5|$|In {{quantum field}} theory, one {{typically}} computes the probabilities of various physical events using {{the techniques of}} perturbation theory. Developed by Richard Feynman {{and others in the}} first half of the twentieth century, perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called Feynman diagrams to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of <b>point-like</b> particles and their interactions. Although this formalism is extremely useful for making predictions, these predictions are only possible when the strength of the interactions, the coupling constant, is small enough to reliably describe the theory as being close to a theory without interactions.|$|E
5|$|Spacetimes are the arenas {{in which}} all {{physical}} events take place—an event is a point in spacetime specified by its time and place. The basic elements of spacetime are events. In any given spacetime, an event is a unique position at a unique time. Because events are spacetime points, in classical relativistic physics, the location of an elementary (<b>point-like)</b> particle {{at a particular time}} can be written as (x, y, z, t). A spacetime is the union of all events {{in the same way that}} a line is the union of all of its points, formally organized into a manifold.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} point for string theory {{is the idea that}} the <b>point-like</b> particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings. The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory. At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional diagram representing the path of a point particle by a two-dimensional surface representing the motion of a string. Unlike in quantum field theory, string theory does not yet have a full non-perturbative definition, so many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach.|$|E
5|$|String {{theory is}} a {{theoretical}} framework that attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics. In string theory, the <b>point-like</b> particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, {{there is only one}} kind of string, which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings. One of the vibrational states of a string gives rise to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.|$|E
5|$|The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory deep inelastic {{scattering}} experiments {{of the late}} 1960s showed that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained <b>point-like</b> particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data {{in a way that}} did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks, and their three-valued color quantum number solves the Omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death.|$|E
5|$|Since the Maxwell {{theory of}} light allows for all {{possible}} energies of electromagnetic radiation, most physicists assumed initially {{that the energy}} quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbs or emits the radiation. In 1905, Einstein {{was the first to}} propose that energy quantization was a property of electromagnetic radiation itself. Although he accepted the validity of Maxwell's theory, Einstein pointed out that many anomalous experiments could be explained if the energy of a Maxwellian light wave were localized into <b>point-like</b> quanta that move independently of one another, even if the wave itself is spread continuously over space. In 1909 and 1916, Einstein showed that, if Planck's law of black-body radiation is accepted, the energy quanta must also carry momentum , making them full-fledged particles. This photon momentum was observed experimentally by Arthur Compton, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1927. The pivotal question was then: how to unify Maxwell's wave theory of light with its experimentally observed particle nature? The answer to this question occupied Albert Einstein {{for the rest of his}} life, and was solved in quantum electrodynamics and its successor, the Standard Model (see Second quantization and The photon as a gauge boson, below).|$|E

25|$|The source {{models can}} be either over-determined or under-determined. An over-determined model may consist of a few <b>point-like</b> sources ("equivalent dipoles"), whose {{locations}} are then estimated from the data. Under-determined models {{may be used in}} cases where many different distributed areas are activated ("distributed source solutions"): there are infinitely many possible current distributions explaining the measurement results, but the most likely is selected. Localization algorithms make use of given source and head models to find a likely location for an underlying focal field generator.|$|E
25|$|Newton's second law {{applies to}} <b>point-like</b> particles, {{and to all}} points in a rigid body. They also apply to each point in a mass continua, like {{deformable}} solids or fluids, but {{the motion of the}} system must be accounted for, see material derivative. In the case the mass is not constant, it is not sufficient to use the product rule for the time derivative on the mass and velocity, and Newton's second law requires some modification consistent with conservation of momentum, see variable-mass system.|$|E
25|$|High-energy {{gamma rays}} (>50MeV photons) were finally {{discovered}} in the primary cosmic radiation by an MIT experiment carried on the OSO-3 satellite in 1967. Components of both galactic and extra-galactic origins were separately identified at intensities much less than 1% of the primary charged particles. Since then, numerous satellite gamma-ray observatories have mapped the gamma-ray sky. The most recent is the Fermi Observatory, which has produced a map showing a narrow band of gamma ray intensity produced in discrete and diffuse sources in our galaxy, and numerous <b>point-like</b> extra-galactic sources distributed over the celestial sphere.|$|E

25|$|The College's {{curriculum}} under Webster and Webb combined classical {{training in}} Latin and Greek with more practical subjects like chemistry, physics, and engineering. One {{of the outstanding}} Nineteenth Century graduates of City College was the Brooklyn-born George Washington Goethals, who put himself through the College in three years before going on to West Point. He later became the chief engineer on the Panama Canal project (1903-1914) {{with one of the}} excavation cuts named for him. General Webb was succeeded by John Huston Finley (1863-1940), as third president in 1903. Finley relaxed some of the West <b>Point-like</b> discipline that characterized the College, including compulsory religious chapel attendance.|$|E
25|$|In {{a highly}} publicized {{experiment}} in 2012, researchers claimed to have identified the path each particle had taken without any adverse effects {{at all on the}} interference pattern generated by the particles. In order to do this, they used a setup such that particles coming to the screen were not from a <b>point-like</b> source, but from a source with two intensity maxima. However, commentators such as Svensson have pointed out that there is in fact no conflict between the weak measurements performed in this variant of the double-slit experiment and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Weak measurement followed by post-selection did not allow simultaneous position and momentum measurements for each individual particle, but rather allowed measurement of the average trajectory of the particles that arrived at different positions. In other words, the experimenters were creating a statistical map of the full trajectory landscape.|$|E
25|$|Standard Model neutrinos are {{fundamental}} <b>point-like</b> particles. An effective size {{can be defined}} using their electroweak cross section (apparent size in electroweak interaction). The average electroweak characteristic size is r2 = n × 10−33cm2 (n × 1nanobarn), where n = 3.2 for electron neutrino, n = 1.7 for muon neutrino and n = 1.0 for tau neutrino; it depends on no other properties than mass. However, this is best understood as being relevant only to probability of scattering. Since the neutrino does not interact electromagnetically, and is defined quantum mechanically by a wavefunction, {{it does not have}} a size in the same sense as everyday objects. Furthermore, processes that produce neutrinos impart such high energies to them that they travel at almost the speed of light. Nevertheless, neutrinos are fermions, and thus obey the Pauli exclusion principle, i.e. that increasing their density forces them into progressively higher momentum states.|$|E
25|$|The high {{symmetry}} of the double-cone topology of the linear E ⊗ e JT system directly reflects the high underlying symmetry. It {{is one of}} the earliest (if not the earliest) examples in the literature of a conical intersection of potential energy surfaces. Conical intersections have received wide attention in the literature starting in the 1990s and are now considered paradigms of nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics, with far-reaching consequences in molecular spectroscopy, photochemistry and photophysics. Some of these will be commented upon further below. In general, conical intersections are far less symmetric than depicted in the figure. They can be tilted and elliptical in shape etc., and also peaked and sloped intersections have been distinguished in the literature. Furthermore, for more than two degrees of freedom, they are not <b>point-like</b> structures but instead they are seams and complicated, curved hypersurfaces, also known as intersection space. The coordinate sub-space displayed in the figure is also known as a branching plane.|$|E
25|$|The letter yud (י) is {{depicted}} by a point with a cusp at its head. The <b>point-like</b> {{nature of the}} yud corresponds to the sefirah of chochmah, which is likened to the initial spark, or point of potential through which a new insight enters reality. The cusp, or tip of the yud reaches upwards and alludes to the super-conscious root of chochmah, which resides in Keter. The first letter hei (ה) of the Tetragrammaton represents {{the expansion of the}} point of the 'yud' into all three spatial dimensions. This corresponds to the sefirah of Binah, which expands and develops the seminal point of wisdom (chochmah) into a detailed idea. The letter vav (ו) resembles a vertical line that connects the higher intellectual faculties with the emotive powers of the psyche. The gematria of the letter vav is 6, corresponding to the six emotive sefirot from loving-kindness to foundation. The final letter hei (ה) of the Tetragrammaton represents the sefirah of malchut.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} perform {{adaptive}} optics correction, {{the shape of}} the incoming wavefronts must be measured as a function of position in the telescope aperture plane. Typically the circular telescope aperture is split up into an array of pixels in a wavefront sensor, either using an array of small lenslets (a Shack–Hartmann sensor), or using a curvature or pyramid sensor which operates on images of the telescope aperture. The mean wavefront perturbation in each pixel is calculated. This pixelated map of the wavefronts is fed into the deformable mirror and used to correct the wavefront errors introduced by the atmosphere. It is not necessary for the shape or size of the astronomical object to be known– even Solar System objects which are not <b>point-like</b> {{can be used in a}} Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor, and time-varying structure on the surface of the Sun is commonly used for adaptive optics at solar telescopes. The deformable mirror corrects incoming light so that the images appear sharp.|$|E

This paper introduced the photon concept (although the name photon was introduced later by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1926) and inspired the notion of wave–particle duality in quantum mechanics.

This special value is the scale of the strong interactions, μ = ΛQCD and occurs at about 200 MeV. Conversely, the coupling becomes weak at very high energies (asymptotic freedom), and the quarks become observable as <b>point-like</b> particles, in deep inelastic scattering, as anticipated by Feynman-Bjorken scaling.
