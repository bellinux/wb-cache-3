5000|$|From 1933, {{the number}} of {{available}} voltage and current ranges in Universal Avometers was doubled by incorporating a dual sensitivity movement circuit. [...] The higher sensitivity was selected by a push button switch marked ÷2 (Divide by two) signifying that the <b>pointer</b> <b>indication</b> should be halved. For the Model 8, this feature was not used but the push button was retained for reversing the direction of deflection of the moving coil.|$|E
40|$|Measuring human {{performance}} {{in terms of}} variables relating directly to the task under evaluation does not always provide indications {{of changes in the}} operator's response. In consequence techniques have been developed which attempt to assess the load imposed by the task in question on the subject in terms of his response on an additional, secondary, task. The literature on the use of secondary tasks is examined and the techniques' successes and shortcomings are assessed. A series of experiments are described in which a secondary task was used to obtain information about the use of a purely numerical display, instead of one embodying a scale and <b>pointer</b> <b>indication,</b> as part of a psycho-motor task. Secondary task measures were able to indicate that parity of performance on the two displays appeared to have been achieved only at the expense of increased {{effort on the part of}} the subjects when using the purely numerical display. It was found that the presence of the secondary task impaired performance on the primary task. This deterioration took place in spite of instructions to the subjects regarding which task was to be considered the primary task. Further experiments were undertaken in an attempt to discover if the source of the interference between the two tasks could be located. It was found that the greatest interference occurred during those phases of the primary task in which decision making and an ensuing action were required. Presenting the secondary task via the same and different sensory pathways to that used for the primary task had no influence upon the patterns of interference obtained. This result was interpreted as indicating that the source of the interference was at a central level in the operator rather than at a peripheral sensory level. This finding is attributed to the limitations in the central information handling processes of the human operator. Physiological measures recorded during two of the experiments showed that the addition of a secondary task raised the level of the subject's responses. Patterns of response variation, particularly in terms of heart rate, could be closely related to the decision making and action components of the primary task...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an auto-recognition method for pointer-type meter based on computer vision. Two calibrated cameras {{are located in}} the right and left sides of the meter to capture the meter displayed images. In each displayed image, the fast Hough transform method is used to locate the approximate pointer area and then the least squares fitting method is used to determine the precise line that represents the pointer indicator. Two precise lines obtained from both right and left displayed images are reconstructed in three-dimensional space according to the epipolar constraint. The line reconstructed is then projected into the target plane to determine the true indication of the meter. Experiments show that the proposed method works very well for the dial pointer identification. The maximum uncertainty in the determination of the <b>pointer’s</b> <b>indication</b> is less than the human eye can discriminate.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} ideal measurements, {{one must}} explain how individual events emerge from quantum theory {{which deals with}} statistical ensembles, and how different may end up with different final states. This so-called "measurement problem" is tackled with two guidelines. On the one hand, {{the dynamics of the}} macroscopic apparatus A coupled to the tested system S is described mathematically within a standard quantum formalism, where "q-probablities" remain devoid of interpretation. On the other hand, interpretative principles are introduced to account for the expected features of ideal measurements. Most of the five principles, which relate the quantum formalism to physical reality, are straightforward and refer to macroscopic variables. The process can be identified with a relaxation of S+A to thermodynamic equilibrium, not only for a large ensemble of runs but even for its sub-ensembles. The different mechanisms of quantum statistical dynamics that ensure the relaxation are exhibited. The additional information provided by the sub-ensembles remove Schrödinger's quantum ambiguity of the final density operator for which hinders its direct interpretation, and bring out a commutative behaviour of the pointer observable at the final time. The latter property supports the introduction of a last principle, needed to switch from the statistical ensembles and sub-ensembles described by quantum theory to individual experimental events. It amounts to identify some formal "q-probabilities" with ordinary frequencies, but only those which refer to the final <b>pointer</b> <b>indications.</b> The desired properties of ideal measurements, in particular the uniqueness of the result for each individual run and von Neumann's reduction, are thereby recovered with economic interpretations. The status of Born's rule involving both A and S is re-evaluated, and contextuality is made obvious. Comment: Matches published version. 24 pages revte...|$|R
50|$|This is not {{the same}} as the {{mechanisms}} provided by calls such as mmap and Win32's MapViewOfFile, because inter-file pointers do not work when mapping files into semi-arbitrary places. In Multics, a file (or a segment from a multi-segment file) is mapped into a segment in the address space, so files are always mapped at a segment boundary. A file's linkage section can contain pointers for which an attempt to load the pointer into a register or make an indirect reference through it causes a trap. The unresolved <b>pointer</b> contains an <b>indication</b> of the name of the segment to which the pointer refers and an offset within the segment; the handler for the trap maps the segment into the address space, puts the segment number into the pointer, changes the tag field in the pointer so that it no longer causes a trap, and returns to the code where the trap occurred, re-executing the instruction that caused the trap. This eliminates the need for a linker completely and works when different processes map the same file into different places in their private address spaces.|$|R
5000|$|The {{making of}} regulations, which clearly is a {{legislative}} administrative action, as against judicial and pure administrative action, is not specifically {{referred to in}} the definition of the term [...] "decision" [...] in section 1 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act. Could it therefore be said that [...] "rule making" [...] was deliberately left out of the definition of the term [...] "decision" [...] and if so, whether it was the intention of the legislature not to include [...] "rule making" [...] in the definition of administrative action? The making of regulations, the subsequent promulgation and the enforcement of such regulations govern the general administrative law relationship as against the individual administrative law relationship. The former is what would constitute [...] "administrative action affecting the public" [...] as contemplated in section 4 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act. This obviously would entail the making and promulgation of such regulation by following the procedure as provided for in section 4(1) of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act. Following the procedure as laid down in section 4(1) of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act would obviously be preceded by a decision to follow that procedure. A decision to follow that procedure would constitute a decision taken in terms of section 4(1) of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act. Now, the taking of a decision or failure to take a decision in terms of section 4(1) has been specifically excluded from the definition of the administrative action.Could it be that the omission to refer to legislative administrative action in the definition of the term [...] "decision" [...] in section 1, and the specific exclusion of taking a decision or failure to take a decision in terms of section 4(1), is a <b>pointer</b> or an <b>indication</b> of an intention to exclude [...] "rule making" [...] from the ambit of administrative action? In my view the legislature could not have intended otherwise. In short, my view is that it was not the intention of the legislature to include rule making in the definition of and in the ambit of administrative action as defined in section 1 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act. To the extent that rule making could be construed as the implementation of national legislation as contemplated in section 85(2)(a) of the Constitution, the latter section of the Constitution provides [...] "in implementing national legislation except where the Constitution or an Act of Parliament provides otherwise". In the instance of this matter the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act, which is an Act of Parliament, provides otherwise.Once again, I must re-iterate, the fact that rule making does not constitute administrative action, does not render the regulations themselves to be beyond judicial scrutiny. The regulations are subject to review {{on the basis of the}} principle of legality, the principles of common law to the extent such common law principles are not inconsistent with the Constitution, the provisions of section 33(1) of the Constitution and other relevant provisions of the Constitution. I am making these observations mindful of what was said by the Constitutional Court in Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of SA and Another: In Re Ex Parte President of the Republic of South Africa and Others that the control of public power is always a constitutional matter.|$|R
