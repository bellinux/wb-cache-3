5|$|Nutrition {{facts are}} {{posted on the}} company's website. As with most pasta-based dishes, the company's noodles dishes are high in carbohydrates, with regular-sized dishes {{containing}} 80–150 grams of carbohydrates <b>per</b> <b>serving</b> (the company's salads and sandwiches tend to be lower in carbohydrates). Many of the regular-sized pasta dishes exceed 1,000 calories, but smaller portions with under 500 calories are available for some dishes. Noodles and Company offers dishes made with gluten-free and vegan ingredients, but warns that cross-contamination may occur.|$|E

25|$|Vitamin B12 is an {{ingredient}} in multi-vitamin pills {{and in some}} countries used to enrich grain-based foods such as bread and pasta. In the U.S. non-prescription products can be purchased providing up to 5,000µg <b>per</b> <b>serving,</b> {{and it is a}} common ingredient in energy drinks and energy shots, usually at many times the recommended dietary allowance of B12. The vitamin can also be a prescription product via injection or other means.|$|E
25|$|Since December 2005, Health Canada has {{required}} that food labels list {{the amount of}} trans fat in the nutrition facts section for most foods. Products with less than 0.2nbsp&grams of trans fat <b>per</b> <b>serving</b> may be labeled as free of trans fats. These labelling allowances are not widely known, but as an awareness of them develops, controversy over truthful labelling is growing. In Canada, trans fat quantities on labels include naturally occurring trans fats from animal sources.|$|E
25|$|French fries {{primarily}} contain carbohydrates {{from the}} potato (mostly {{in the form}} of starch) and fat absorbed during the deep-frying process, as well as sodium depending upon the seasoning. For example, a large serving of French fries at McDonald's in the United States is 154 grams. Nearly all of the 500 calories <b>per</b> <b>serving</b> come from the 63 g of carbohydrates and the 25 g of fat, but a serving also contains 6 g of protein and 350mg of sodium.|$|E
40|$|Coffee is an {{important}} global beverage, and has received significant attention {{especially in terms of}} the social and environmental sustainability of its production. This paper calculates the product carbon footprint (PCF) and conducts an analysis of energy usage for six alternative coffee products. The analysis shows that espresso coffee had the lowest impact (0. 13 kWh and 49 g CO 2 <b>per</b> <b>serve),</b> while canned coffee provided the highest impact (0. 76 kWh and 223 g CO 2 <b>per</b> <b>serve).</b> The latte had the second highest embodied energy impact, with 0. 54 kWh and the highest PCF of 224 g CO 2 <b>per</b> <b>serve.</b> On a <b>per</b> millilitre basis however, espresso coffee provided the highest impact (0. 0048 kWh/mL and 0. 8 g CO 2 -eq/mL), followed by canned coffee and the latte. This indicates that care must be used in the selection of an appropriate functional unit, as the ranking of PCF can be overturned according to the basis of comparison. The highest contributing factors were the emissions from milk, packaging (for the can) and the production stages of the green coffee beans. Despite only holding around 17 % of the market share of consumed coffee, the canned coffee product contributes around half of the national carbon footprint from coffee consumption. Current commercial incentives for consumers to use their own cups were compared to carbon taxation and found to value carbon approximately three orders of magnitude higher than carbon market rates...|$|R

25|$|After {{reports of}} {{research}} finding that dietary oats can help lower cholesterol, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a final rule that allows food companies to make health claims on food labels of foods that contain soluble fiber from whole oats (oat bran, oat flour and rolled oats), noting that 3.0grams of soluble fiber daily from these foods {{may reduce the}} risk of heart disease. To qualify for the health claim, the food that contains the oats must provide at least 0.75grams of soluble fiber <b>per</b> <b>serving.</b>|$|E
25|$|Caffeine is also {{a common}} {{ingredient}} of soft drinks, such as cola, originally prepared from kola nuts. Soft drinks typically contain 0 to 55 milligrams of caffeine per 12 ounce serving. By contrast, energy drinks, such as Red Bull, can start at 80 milligrams of caffeine <b>per</b> <b>serving.</b> The caffeine in these drinks either originates from the ingredients used or is an additive derived from the product of decaffeination or from chemical synthesis. Guarana, a prime ingredient of energy drinks, contains large amounts of caffeine with small amounts of theobromine and theophylline in a naturally occurring slow-release excipient.|$|E
25|$|Marmite {{is rich in}} B {{vitamins}} including thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), {{folic acid}} (B9) and vitamin B12. The sodium content of the spread is high and has caused concern, although it is the amount <b>per</b> <b>serving</b> rather than the percentage in bulk Marmite that is relevant. The main ingredient of Marmite is yeast extract, which contains {{a high concentration of}} glutamic acid. Marmite made in the United Kingdom and exported to several countries is almost gluten free. However, Unilever will not confirm that it contains less than 20 PPM of gluten, the current European standard and the proposed US FDA standard for gluten-free labelling.|$|E

25|$|The J.M. Smucker Company, American {{manufacturer}} of Crisco (the original partially hydrogenated vegetable shortening), in 2004 released a new formulation made from solid saturated palm oil cut with soybean oil and sunflower oil. This blend yielded an equivalent shortening {{much like the}} previous partially hydrogenated Crisco, and was labelled zero grams of trans fat per 1 tablespoon serving (as compared with 1.5grams per tablespoon of original Crisco). As of 24 January 2007, Smucker claims that all Crisco shortening products in the US have been reformulated to contain less than one gram of trans fat <b>per</b> <b>serving</b> while keeping saturated fat content less than butter. The separately marketed trans fat free version introduced in 2004 was discontinued.|$|E
25|$|Critics of the plan, {{including}} FDA advisor Dr. Carlos Camargo, {{have expressed}} concern that the 0.5gram <b>per</b> <b>serving</b> threshold is too high to refer to a food as free of trans fat. This is because a person eating many servings of a product, or eating multiple products {{over the course of the}} day may still consume a significant amount of trans fat. Despite this, the FDA estimates that by 2009, trans fat labeling will have prevented from 600 to 1,200 cases of coronary artery disease and 250 to 500 deaths each year. This benefit is expected to result from consumers choosing alternative foods lower in trans fats, as well as manufacturers reducing the amount of trans fats in their products.|$|E
25|$|New York City {{embarked}} on a campaign in 2005 to reduce consumption of trans fats, noting that heart disease is {{the primary cause of}} resident deaths. This has included a Public education campaign and a request to restaurant owners to eliminate trans fat from their offerings voluntarily. Finding that the voluntary program was not successful, New York City's Board of Health in 2006 solicited public comments on a proposal to ban artificial trans fats in restaurants. The board voted to ban trans fat in restaurant food on 5 December 2006. New York was the first large US city to strictly limit trans fats in restaurants. Restaurants were barred from using most frying and spreading fats containing artificial trans fats above 0.5 g <b>per</b> <b>serving</b> on 1 July 2007, and were supposed to have met the same target in all of their foods by 1 July 2008.|$|E
