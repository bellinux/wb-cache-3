On February 26, 2007, U.S. District Judge Edward Korman rejected this argument and held that the city could not cap damages, writing, [...] "The city's failure to provide a second pilot or otherwise adopt a reasonable practice that addresses the issue of <b>pilot</b> <b>incapacitation</b> was plainly a substantial factor in causing the disaster." ...|$|E
40|$|In-flight {{impairment}} and incapacitation {{are defined as}} states wherein the pilot’s ability to effectively control the aircraft is adversely affected. They are of special concern in general aviation given {{there may be no}} second pilot to take over the controls. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine the characteristics of fatal general aviation accidents associated with {{impairment and}} incapacitation. A comprehensive review of 2, 696 fatal general aviation accidents from 1990 - 1998 using database records maintained by the NTSB and FAA yielded 216 accidents (8. 01 %) that had some form of impairment/incapacitation or physiological causes mentioned in the accident report. Impairment due to drugs (n = 88, 40. 7 %) and alcohol (n = 68, 31. 5 %) were the most common causes. Cardiovascular causes were cited in 12. 03 % (n = 26) of the cases. Significant relationships were observed between age and impairment/incapacitation due to alcohol, drugs, and cardiovascular causes. Some disparities were observed between the prevalence of alcohol in toxicology samples and alcohol impairment being cited in the accident report as a contributory factor. The analysis provides some insight into the possible causes of <b>pilot</b> impairment and <b>incapacitation</b> in general aviation.

40|$|Pilot spatial {{disorientation}} {{is a leading}} factor contributing to many fatal flying accidents. Spatial orientation {{is the product of}} integrative inputs from the proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual systems. Vestibular neuritis (VN) can lead to sudden <b>pilot</b> <b>incapacitation</b> in flight. VN is commonly diagnosed by demonstration of unilateral vestibular failure, as unilateral loss of caloric response. As this test reflects the function of the superior part of the vestibular nerve only, cases of pure inferior nerve neuritis will be lost. This paper describes a fighter pilot with symptoms suggestive of VN but with normal caloric test results. Further test showed unilateral loss of vestibular evoked myogenic potential. We believe that the pilot suffered from pure inferior nerve vestibular neuritis. VEMP {{plays a major role in}} the diagnosis of inferior nerve vestibular neuritis in pilots.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the conceptual {{design of a}} Virtual Pilot Assistant (VPA) based on {{an analysis of the}} requirements for single-pilot operations of commercial transport aircraft. In particular, the analysis takes into account existing literature on single pilot operations from general aviation and military standards. The analysis also considers relevant human factors engineering and system design aspects of Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) and conventional two-pilot aircraft. The VPA performs a real-time assessment of the single-pilot‟s cognitive states as well as making predictions on the performance levels of the single pilot, thereby providing complementary and timely support to the single pilot as required. In case of <b>pilot</b> <b>incapacitation,</b> the VPA enables the single-pilot aircraft to be operated as an RPAS, allowing ground operators to take over as necessary and make an emergency landing at a suitable location...|$|E
40|$|Existing manned cockpit {{operations}} {{consider the}} reduction of the team of pilots to one pilot to save costs, improve crew scheduling and aircraft availability. However, safety concerns have so far prevented the introduction of single-pilot flights in commercial aviation. This study seeks to address these concerns by offering an alternative tripartite concept for commercial single-pilot operations including a remote-copilot center. The main focus is on the ground station. Different kinds of remote-copilots and ground-operators support the single-pilot: a departure remote-copilot, an arrival remote-copilot; and different cruise remote-copilots/ground operators, who serve as specialist in their field of operation. A socio-technical system is defined which has the potential to deal with several issues arising in commercial single-pilot operations (SPO). <b>Pilot</b> <b>incapacitation,</b> flight length, and training are discussed. On the basis of the proposed tripartite function allocation on a higher level, a first step towards SPO in commercial aviation is made...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of group dynamics on {{the capability of}} aircraft crew members to make full use of the resources available on the flight deck {{in order to maintain}} flight safety is discussed. Instances of crewmembers withholding altimeter or heading information from the captain are cited as examples of domineering attitudes from command pilots and overconscientiousness on the parts of copilots, who may refuse to relay information forcefully enough or {{to take control of the}} aircraft in the case of <b>pilot</b> <b>incapacitation.</b> NASA studies of crew performance in controlled, simulator settings, concentrating on communication, decision making, crew interaction, and integration showed that efficient communication reduced errors. Acknowledgements served to encourage correct communication. The best crew performance is suggested to occur with personnel who are capable of both goal and group orientation. Finally, one bad effect of computer controlled flight is cited to be the tendency of the flight crew to think that someone else is taking care of difficulties in threatening situations...|$|E
40|$|Nine {{cooperating}} rule-based systems, collectively called AUTOCREW {{which were}} designed to automate functions and decisions associated with a combat aircraft's subsystems, are discussed. The organization of tasks within each system is described; performance metrics were developed to evaluate the workload of each rule base and to assess the cooperation between the rule bases. Simulation and comparative workload results for two mission scenarios are given. The scenarios are inbound surface-to-air-missile attack on the aircraft and <b>pilot</b> <b>incapacitation.</b> The methodology used to develop the AUTOCREW knowledge bases is summarized. Issues involved in designing the navigation sensor selection expert in AUTOCREW's NAVIGATOR knowledge base are discussed in detail. The performance of seven navigation systems aiding a medium-accuracy INS was investigated using Kalman filter covariance analyses. A navigation sensor management (NSM) expert system was formulated from covariance simulation data using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method and the ID 3 algorithm. ANOVA results show that statistically different position accuracies are obtained when different navaids are used, the number of navaids aiding the INS is varied, the aircraft's trajectory is varied, and the performance history is varied. The ID 3 algorithm determines the NSM expert's classification rules {{in the form of}} decision trees. The performance of these decision trees was assessed on two arbitrary trajectories, and the results demonstrate that the NSM expert adapts to new situations and provides reasonable estimates of the expected hybrid performance...|$|E
40|$|History {{has shown}} that a larger flight crew does not per se imply that {{aircraft}} operations will be safer. The goal of this thesis {{is to determine the}} technical hurdles to Single Pilot Commercial Operations (SPCO). Continued technological developments, the upsurge of commercial Unmanned Aerial Systems, the non-negligible cost of air crews, and yet, stagnation in commercial crew reductions since 1980 are reasons to clarify the current technical hurdles to SPCO. The research was initiated with a broad literature survey. It was found that advances in technology and human factors understanding have made each historical crew reduction possible, through a redistribution of tasks across (fewer) humans, automation, supporting infrastructure and accompanying procedures. An exhaustive list was then formulated of all issues that could potentially affect a reduction to SPCO. Consequently, in-depth research of each issue determined the most predominant challenges to SPCO are; a. providing the single pilot with the correct situational awareness at a manageable workload; b. ensuring adequate monitoring of pilot performance without an on-board human co-pilot; and c. ensuring redundancy in case of incapacitation. Finally, Single <b>Pilot</b> <b>Incapacitation</b> Redundancy (SPIR) solutions were explored by means of a scenario analysis and functional analysis. The greatest challenge to SPIR {{turns out to be the}} setting of the incapacitation detection sensitivity threshold; avoiding excessive false warnings (alarm problem) yet retaining immediacy for timely recovery of stable flight; both incapacitation detection and seem-less control take-over are tasks more suited to the adaptability of humans. A concept for a SPCO flight deck has been presented in which these issues become obsolete. Master Aerospace Engineering.

40|$|Accidents due to engine failure, pilot {{disorientation}} or <b>pilot</b> <b>incapacitation</b> occur {{far more}} frequently in general aviation than in commercial aviation, yet general aviation aircraft are equipped with less safety-enhancing features than commercial aircraft. This thesis presents the design of an emergency autoland system that includes automatic landing site selection, guidance to the selected landing site and guidance along the final approach, {{in addition to the}} automatic landing capability provided by conventional autoland systems. The proposed system builds on the capability of a general aviation autopilot, flight management system and GPS/WAAS augmented, integrated navigation system. The system provides this automatic landing capability without the use of automatic throttle control and without the use of a radar altimeter, which are essential to conventional autoland systems, but are typically lacking on general aviation aircraft. The design addresses the challenge of no automatic throttle control by utilizing only two simple power settings: cruise power and zero power. The lack of radar altimeter is addressed by appropriate flare planning and placement of the target touchdown point. The approach from the point of autoland initiation, to the approach fix at the the landing site, is performed at cruise power, provided that power is available. The final approach from the approach fix to touchdown, is performed at zero power. Control of the touchdown point location during the final approach is achieved through adjustment of the length of the trajectory, whenever the aircraft’s glide performance deviates from the expected performance. The aircraft’s glide performance is measured online as the aircraft tracks the planned trajectory. The performance of the final design is evaluated in simulation in terms of touchdown point dispersion, sink rate and attitude on touchdown. Avidyne, Inc...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} an {{increased}} concern of impact to human health from exposure to lubricants and organophosphates (OPs) for workers in the aviation industry. In spite of this concern, neither methods for assessing such exposure nor relevant exposure data for air concentrations of OPs could be found in the scientific literature. This revealed a need for development of such methods and work task related exposure measurements of OPs in the aviation industry in general. The four papers presented in this thesis describe development of sampling methodology and their use in the aviation industry for assessment of OPs in occupational air. Paper I describes the method development needed for air sampling of OPs originating from lubricants such as hydraulic and turbine oils. Combinations of adsorbents, filters and extraction/desorption solvents were evaluated with respect to air sampling and analysis by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of six OPs* in presence of lubricants. The combination of Chromosorb 106 and 37 mm filter cassette with glass fiber filter and dichloromethane (DCM) as extraction/desorption solvent and tri-n-amyl phosphate (TnAP) as volumetric internal standard, was demonstrated to be well suited for sampling of airborne OPs originating from hydraulic and turbine oils. While conventional pumped air sampling with a sampling train is documented in Paper I, Paper II describes development and evaluation of a semi-automatic sampler tailored for collecting volatile organic compounds, including certain OPs. This “incident sampler” is based on a pre-activated sampling unit that is stored at the work place of interest and a final simple activation performed by the worker that is subjected to the exposure. Intoxication of workers due to incidental chemical exposure has shown to be of high relevance. For instance, <b>pilot</b> <b>incapacitation</b> is the ultimate safety threat and consequently underlines the importance of revealing possible unknown contaminants in their working atmosphere. For that reason, the availability of an incident sampler in environments with risk of sudden chemical exposure is presented as an important tool to reveal possible contaminants from incidental air contamination. Ten such samplers were therefore installed in aircrafts within a 12 month period (Paper IV). However, neither of these aircrafts experienced such contamination incidents during this period, and the samplers were thus never activated during such incidents. Paper III presents air measurements during loader and technician work operations. In total, 228 and 182 OPs and oil aerosol/vapor samples from technician and loader work tasks during work on 42 and 21 aircrafts, respectively, were collected in pairs. Additionally, 75 combined VOC/OP/oil and 40 combined OP/oil samples were collected from aircraft cargo rooms and from jet engine tail pipes during loading work operations, respectively, while 16 samples were collected during provoked situations related to technician work. VOCs and the butyl phosphates TnBP and DBPP were identified in most of the samples, most probably due to their frequent use and greater volatility than TCP. The highest TnBP exposure was during pressure drop in the wheel wells in one of the airplane models (maximum 9 mg/m 3), and the butyl phosphates were also found to be present at background concentrations of 1 - 30 μg/m 3. The potential for higher exposure levels during worst case situations was also investigated, for instance by exposure provocations and direct measurements close to the exposure sources such as jet engine tail pipes where maximum oil aerosol and TCP levels were 240 and 30 mg/m 3, respectively. Measurements of contaminants in cabin air are presented in Paper IV. A set of tailored sampling methods were applied, including development of new long-term sample methods based on deposition to a wipe surface area and an activated charcoal cloth installed on walls inside the airplane. In total, 167 pumped within-day OP/VOC samples and 108 longterm samples were collected in cabin and cockpit air from 40 unique aircrafts during 47 commercial flights. Total-VOC was measured using sampling with thermal desorption tubes, and was determined in all 71 such samples (min-max 0. 20 - 2. 7 mg/m 3). For pumped within-day air sampling, TnBP levels were highest in model A airplanes and were detected in all airplane flights (n= 76, min-max 0. 02 - 4. 1 μg/m 3), while TCP was detected only on samples collected from four flights in model C airplanes (min-max The four papers presented in this thesis thus encompass new air sampling methodologies and their application for characterization of OP contamination levels in the aviation industry, in addition to determination of oil aerosol and tVOC. This has resulted in collection of nearly 900 samples during general work tasks for technician and loaders, and in cockpit and cabin air during commercial flights, which is a substantial contribution to the knowledge of occupational exposure to OPs in this industry...|$|E
