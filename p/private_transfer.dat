There is little existing evidence for crowding out effects in the literature, but this may be because they have been obscured by methods that ignore non-linearities. If donors switch from altruistic motivations to exchange motivations as recipient income increases, a sharp non-linear relationship between <b>private</b> <b>transfers</b> and income may result. In fact, threshold regression techniques find such non-linearity in the Philippines and after accounting for these there is evidence of serious crowding out, with 30 to 80 percent of <b>private</b> <b>transfers</b> potentially displaced for low-income households [Cox, D., Hansen, B., and Jimenez, E., 2004, How responsive are <b>private</b> <b>transfers</b> to income?

While internal FDI has no noteworthy effect on the mean wage of poor people, outward FDI from Taiwan in the previous two decades appears to have adversely affected the poorest 20% of the populace. Poverty in Taiwan has nearly been eliminated, with under 1 percent of the populace considered as poor or earning the low-level pay. This implies more than 99 percent of the populace appreciates the advantages of Taiwan's economic flourishing and extraordinarily enhanced personal satisfaction. Beside lowly-paid families, the government offers support to other individuals, for example, the elderly and the incapacitated, who can't work. During 1980 to 1999 Taiwanese government developed a program called National Health Insurance program. NHI mainly provides economically disadvantaged people with quality healthcare at an affordable price. July 1993, the government of Taiwan started giving a monthly sponsorship to elderly people. People beyond 65 years old whose normal family salary is not exactly, or equivalent to, 1.5 times the base monthly costs are fit to get a monthly sponsorship of $174.

Given the {{importance}} of <b>private</b> <b>transfers</b> in household income, quantitatively evaluating the response of <b>private</b> <b>transfers</b> to recipient incomes is informative for the design and the implementation of public interventions, such as policy alleviation programs, which often include transfer programs. To the extent that <b>private</b> <b>transfers</b> interact with public ones, the overall impact of public transfers might be offset, leaving income distribution unchanged. I use the transfers model proposed by Cox, and two national surveys from Burkina to test whether <b>private</b> <b>transfers</b> are motivated by altruism, exchanges or by risk sharing objectives. The econometric estimations control for income endogeneity via instrumental variables, and use three alternative specifications: a spline regression, which is standard in the literature, a friction model which controls for the large fraction of non-participants, and a partial linear model which relaxes the functional form assumption between transfers and income. The findings support the equalizing effects of <b>private</b> <b>transfers.</b> Furthermore, transfers received are reduced by pre-transfers incomes and the effect is larger for low income households. These results support altruistic motives for transfers. In the highest quartile, exchanges motives seem to prevail {{as indicated by the}} semi-parametric explorations. Transfers are also used to cope with income risk, although the response to transitory income shocks is relatively small. Overall, the findings provide evidence on the interactions between <b>private</b> and public <b>transfers,</b> which may limit the net effects of public interventions which use transfers to pursue income equality objectives.

In 1909, for instance, Muslims, who made up almost 90% of the population but produced 20% of Algeria's income, paid 70% of direct taxes and 45% of the total taxes collected. And colons controlled how these revenues would be spent.
