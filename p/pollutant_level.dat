50|$|Scientists {{are still}} trying to {{understand}} the microorganisms within PM2.5 particles and how they are spread through pollutants. Research indicated that many kinds of pathogens and bacteria can be spread through PM2.5 smog and cause diseases. For example, Chinese researchers have found that smog in Beijing contains significant amounts of inhalable microbial allergens and pathogenic species, which increase the risk of respiratory diseases. The same study also reported that among all the microorganisms within PM2.5 particles, 86.1% are bacteria, 13% eukaryota, 0.8% archaea, and 0.1% viruses. The smog contains a variety of microorganisms such as Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Euryarchaeota. Many of these are not harmful to humans, but some pathogenic microorganisms are carried through smog, and their numbers increase as the <b>pollutant</b> <b>level</b> increases.|$|E
