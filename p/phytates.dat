Design: 2002 China Nationwide Nutrition and Health Survey is a {{cross-sectional}} nationwide representative survey on nutrition and health. The information on dietary intakes was collected using consecutive 3 days 24 |[thinsp]|h recall by trained interviewers. Subjects: The data of 68 |[thinsp]| 962 residents aged 2 |[ndash]| 101 years old from 132 counties were analyzed. Results: The median daily dietary intake of <b>phytate,</b> calcium, iron and zinc were 1186, 338. 1, 21. 2 and 10. 6 |[thinsp]|mg, respectively. Urban residents consumed less <b>phytate</b> (781 vs 1342 |[thinsp]|mg|[sol]|day), more calcium (374. 5 vs 324. 1 |[thinsp]|mg|[sol]|day) and comparable amounts of iron (21. 1 vs 21. 2 |[thinsp]|mg|[sol]|day) and zinc (10. 6 vs 10. 6 |[thinsp]|mg|[sol]|day) than their rural counterparts. A wide variation in <b>phytate</b> intake among residents from six areas was found, ranging from 648 to 1433 |[thinsp]|mg|[sol]|day. The median molar ratios of <b>phytate</b> to calcium, iron, zinc and <b>phytate</b> |[times]| calcium|[sol]|zinc were 0. 22, 4. 88, 11. 1 and 89. 0, respectively, with a large variation between urban and rural areas.

25|$|The {{recommended}} iron intake for vegetarians is 1.8 {{times that}} of nonvegetarians, because plants, dairy, and eggs contain only non-heme iron, and this is absorbed less efficiently than heme iron. Although a lower percentage of non-heme iron is absorbed, greater amounts of non-heme iron are concentrated in many non-meat sources of iron (than the amount of iron per serving in meats), and therefore, cereals, eggs, nuts, seeds, and legumes (including soy foods, peas, beans, chickpeas, and lentils) are significant sources of iron, and a well-planned vegetarian diet should not lead to iron deficiency, but fruitarianism and raw foods diets should not be pursued for infants or children. Meat, fish, and poultry (not dairy or eggs) are the only sources of heme iron; intake of heme iron {{may be associated with}} colon cancer. Non-heme iron is more sensitive to both inhibitors and enhancers of iron absorption. Vitamin C is an iron absorption enhancer.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Microbial phytases (EC 3. 1. 3) {{are widely}} used in diets for {{monogastric}} animals to hydrolyse <b>phytate</b> present in the feed and thereby increase phosphorus and mineral availability. Previous work has shown that <b>phytate</b> solubility is strongly affected by calcium in the feed and by pH in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which may {{have an effect on}} phytase efficacy. An in vitro model simulating the GI tract of pigs was used to study the survival of Peniophora lycii phytase and the effect of the phytase on <b>phytate</b> degradation, inositol phosphate formation and mineral solubilisation during in vitro digestion of a 30 : 70 soybean meal/maize meal blend with different calcium levels. RESULTS: The phytase retained 76 and 80 % of its initial activity throughout the gastric in vitro digestion. Total <b>phytate</b> hydrolysis by P. lycii phytase was in the same range at total calcium levels of 1. 2 and 6. 2 mg g(- 1) dry matter (DM), despite very large differences in <b>phytate</b> solubility at these calcium levels. However, at 11. 2 and 21. 2 mg Ca g(- 1) DM, <b>phytate</b> hydrolysis was significantly lower. The amount of soluble mineral was generally increased by P. lycii phytase. CONCLUSION: Stability of P. lycii phytase during gastric digestion was not found to be critical for <b>phytate</b> hydrolysis. Furthermore, original <b>phytate</b> solubility was not an absolute requirement for <b>phytate</b> degradation; <b>phytate</b> solubility seemed to be in a steady state, allowing insoluble <b>phytate</b> to solubilise as soluble <b>phytate</b> was degraded.

40|$|Zinc (Zn) is {{the most}} {{vulnerable}} cation to complexation with <b>phytate.</b> An experiment was conducted to evaluate the potential of measurements of Zn concentration in the gastrointestinal tract as a marker to assess the anti-nutritional impact of <b>phytate</b> and susceptibility of <b>phytate</b> to phytase in broilers. Ross 308 broilers (n = 180) were fed one of 5 experimental diets with differing phytase activity levels, analyzed at 605, 1150, 1804, 3954 and 5925 U/kg. Broiler performance and Zn concentration, pH and amount of <b>phytate</b> hydrolyzed in the gizzard, duodenum and ileum were analyzed at d 21 post hatch. <b>Phytate</b> susceptibility to phytase degradation was determined in vivo and in vitro by measuring total phytate-P hydrolyzed in the tract or in conditions that mimicked the tract, respectively. Phytase activity level had a significant (P < 0. 05) impact on Zn concentration and <b>phytate</b> hydrolyzed in the gizzard and ileum, {{but not in the}} duodenum. Strong relationships were observed between the amount of <b>phytate</b> hydrolyzed and Zn concentration in the gizzard in birds fed the diets with 1804 U/kg or higher levels of phytase. <b>Phytate</b> and phytase effects could therefore potentially be evaluated by measuring Zn concentration in the gizzard. Susceptible <b>phytate</b> levels measured in vivo and in vitro were almost identical in the diet with phytase activity of 5925 U/kg, but in the diets with lower phytase activity levels the in vitro assay overestimated the amount of P released. There were strong relationships between in vivo susceptible <b>phytate</b> level and pH and amount of <b>phytate</b> hydrolyzed in the gizzard, duodenum and ileum and Zn concentration in the gizzard and ileum. This illustrates that <b>phytate</b> susceptibility directly effects mineral availability in the gastrointestinal tract.

40|$|Measurements {{of total}} <b>phytate</b> {{phosphorus}} content of diets may be deceptive {{as they do}} not indicate substrate availability for phytase; {{it may be that}} measurements of <b>phytate</b> susceptible to phytase effects are a more accurate measure of phosphorus (P) availability to the bird. To verify this hypothesis, an experiment was conducted to compare diets formulated to contain either high or low susceptible <b>phytate,</b> supplemented with either 0 or 500  FTU/kg phytase. Susceptible <b>phytate</b> was determined by exposing the feed samples to conditions that mimicked the average pH of the proximal gastrointestinal tract (pH 4. 5) and the optimum temperature for phytase activity (37 °C) and then measuring <b>phytate</b> dissolved. Ross 308 birds (n =  240) were fed one of 4 dietary treatments in a 2  ×  2 factorial design; 2 diets with high (8. 54  g/kg, 57. 90 % of total <b>phytate)</b> or low (5. 77  g/kg, 46. 33 % of total <b>phytate)</b> susceptible <b>phytate,</b> containing 0 or 500  FTU/kg phytase. Diets were fed to broilers (12 replicate pens of 5 birds per pen) from d 0 to 28 post hatch. Birds fed diets high in susceptible <b>phytate</b> had greater <b>phytate</b> hydrolysis in the gizzard (P <  0. 001), jejunum (P <  0. 001) and ileum (P <  0. 001) and resulting greater body weight gain (BWG) (P =  0. 015) and lower FCR (P =  0. 003) than birds fed the low susceptible <b>phytate</b> diets, irrespective of phytase presence. Birds fed the high susceptible diets also had greater P solubility in the gizzard and Ca and P solubility in the jejunum and ileum (P <  0. 05) and resulting greater tibia and femur Ca and P (P <  0. 05) content than those fed the low susceptible diets. All the susceptible <b>phytate</b> was fully degraded in the tract in the absence of added phytase, suggesting the assay used in this study was able to successfully estimate the amount of total dietary <b>phytate</b> that was susceptible to the effects of phytase when used at standard levels. No interactions were observed between susceptible <b>phytate</b> and phytase on <b>phytate</b> hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of <b>phytate</b> was greater (P <  0. 05) in the gizzard of birds fed the diets supplemented with phytase, regardless of the concentration of susceptible <b>phytate</b> in the diet. Phytase supplementation resulted in improved BWG (P <  0. 001) and FCR (P =  0. 001), increased P solubility (P <  0. 001) in the gizzard, Ca and P solubility (P <  0. 001) in the jejunum and ileum and Ca and P concentration (P <  0. 001) and strength (P <  0. 001) in the tibia and femur. Pepsin activity was higher in birds fed the diets supplemented with phytase (P <  0. 001) and was greater (P =  0. 031) in birds fed the high susceptible <b>phytate</b> diets compared with the low susceptible <b>phytate</b> diets.

The result is that <b>phytate</b> is a main organic P form in soil and the dominating form of identifiable organic P. The reasons for the accumulation are not fully clear. Two hypothesis {{can be found in the}} literature in the last 20 years, the low activity of phytase (phosphatases) in soil, which makes <b>phytate</b> P unavailable to the plant roots, and, on the other hand, the strong binding of <b>phytate</b> {{to the soil}} solid phase with its consequent stabilization and accumulation in soil. The hypothesis that low phytase activity is responsible for <b>phytate</b> accumulation led to the development of genetically modified plant genotypes with a higher expression of phytase activity at the root surface and research on the effect of a higher <b>phytate</b> activity on P acquisition. Obviously, this hypothesis has a basic assumption, that the <b>phytate</b> mobility in soil is not the limiting step for P acquisition of higher plants from soil <b>phytate.</b> This assumption is, however, not justified considering the results on the sorption, immobilization and fixation of <b>phytate</b> to the soil solid phase reported in the last two decades. <b>Phytate</b> is strongly bound, and the P sorption maximum and probably the sorption strength of <b>phytate</b> P to the soil solid phase is much higher, compared to that of orthophosphate P. Mobilization of <b>phytate</b> seems to be a promising step to make it available to the plant roots. The excretion of organic acid anions, citrate and to a lesser extend oxalate, seems to be an important way to make <b>phytate</b> P available to the plants. Phytase activity at the root surface seems not be the limiting step in P acquisition from <b>phytate.</b> <b>Phytate</b> is not only bound to inorganic surfaces in soil but can also be bound, similar to orthophosphate, to humic surfaces via Fe or Al bridges. Humic-metal-phytate complexes may be transported in the soil solution to the roots where hydrolysis and uptake of the liberated P may occur. Research on this topic is strongly required...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} aims of {{this thesis}} were to establish whether soluble calcium-phytate complexes inhibit calcium oxalate crystallisation and whether a higher dietary intake of <b>phytate</b> in South African black subjects compared to white subjects {{may contribute to}} the relative rarity of urolithiasis in this group. Potentiometric titrations were conducted to determine thermodynamic binding constants of soluble calcium-phytate complexes. Binding constants of seven complexes were identified. These were included in the data base of the Joint Experts Speciation System computer program to model the effect of <b>phytate</b> on the urinary supersaturation of calcium salts. Physiological concentrations of <b>phytate</b> failed to decrease ionized calcium and hence the urinary supersaturation of calcium salts. These theoretical predictions were then tested in an in vitro model. Calcium oxalate crystallisation experiments were conducted in simple salt solutions, artificial urine and real urine of the respective groups. The following parameters were measured: ionized calcium; calcium oxalate metastable limit; calcium oxalate particle volume-size distribution; calcium oxalate crystal nucleation, aggregation and growth kinetics. Deposited crystals were examined by scanning electron microscopy. The results confirmed those of the theoretical modelling. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the inhibitory capacity of <b>phytate</b> is of a kinetic nature rather than a thermodynamic one. <b>Phytate</b> inhibited calcium oxalate crystal aggregation and the inhibition of calcium oxalate crystal growth was found to be independent of the physiological concentration of <b>phytate.</b> In vivo studies were conducted in which phytate-deficient, phytate-rich diets and a <b>phytate</b> supplement were administered in healthy black and white male volunteers. The baseline intake of <b>phytate</b> was assessed using food frequency questionnaires; urinary <b>phytate</b> was determined using a novel assay; biochemical and physiochemical urinary risk factors were measured. The black group had a significantly higher baseline intake of <b>phytate</b> culminating in a significantly higher urinary <b>phytate</b> excretion. No significant difference in urinary crystallisation kinetics was observed as being due to <b>phytate</b> per se. The findings of this thesis contribute to the pool of knowledge on urolithiasis and provide insight on the relative rarity of this disease in South Africa's black population...|$|R
