40|$|Specimens {{collected}} from six broiler flocks were cultured for salmonellae by three methods. (i) For direct enrichment, the specimen was homogenized, and 1 ml of the homogenate was inoculated into tetrathionate-brillant green broth; (ii) for <b>preenrichment,</b> liquid specimens and homogenates were incubated at 37 degrees C, {{and on the}} next day 1 ml was inoculated into tetrathionate-brillant green broth; and (iii) for delayed secondary enrichment, incubated <b>preenrichment</b> cultures were held at room temperature for 7 to 10 days and then subcultured to fresh tetrathionate-brilliant green broth. All tetrathionate-brilliant green broth cultures were incubated at 42 degrees C for 24 to 48 h before plating. Significantly more isolations of salmonellae were obtained by delayed secondary enrichment than by direct enrichment or <b>preenrichment.</b> Salmonellae were isolated from 417 of 2, 283 (18. 3 %) samples of litter, intestinal contents, and feces cultured by all three methods. Of these positive specimens, direct enrichment detected 208 (49. 9 %), <b>preenrichment</b> detected 282 (67. 6 %), and delayed secondary enrichment detected 373 (89. 4 %).

40|$|Traditional {{bacteriological}} {{cultivation of}} samples for salmonellae typically have involved a <b>preenrichment</b> in buffered peptone water, particularly for samples suspected of harboring low numbers of salmonellae. Many researchers; however, have since dispensed with this initial step (4 - 6, 13, 17 - 20), opting instead for direct enrichment in tetrathionite broth, especially for samples suspected of containing nonhost adapted serotypes. However, direct enrichment in tetrathionite {{may be too}} harsh for optimal recovery of Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis (3, 16). Thus, GN-Hajna broth has been recommended as a <b>preenrichment</b> broth for samples suspected of containing this host adapted serotype (7) and {{has been used in}} several recent studies (I, 4, 8 - 10).

40|$|ABSTRACT Chicken meat is an {{important}} vehicle of foodborne pathogens, such as Salmonella spp., and de-mands a systematic control of microbiological contami-nation during industrial processing. This control occurs by the adoption of quality control systems in slaughters based on the microbiological investigation on hygiene indicators and pathogens, requiring the development of fast, trustable, and precise methodologies. The ob-jective {{of this study was}} to compare the Salmonella spp. conventional methodology to a protocol of PCR in chicken carcass surface samples. The PCR protocol was developed directly from the collected samples and from <b>preenrichment</b> broth before and after incubation. The obtained results were compared by χ 2 and McNe-mar tests (P 0. 05), the PCR developed from <b>preenrichment</b> after incubation presented significant differences from all the other methodologies (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to evaluate methods for identifying cattle with high concentrations of Escherichia coli O 157 in their feces. In two experiments, feces were collected from cattle orally inoculated with nalidixic acid (Nal) -resistant E. coli O 157, and direct plating of diluted feces on sorbitol MacConkey agar with cefixime and potassium tellurite (CT-SMAC) containing Nal was considered the gold standard (GS) method. In experiment 1, methods evaluated were <b>preenrichment</b> direct streak, immunomagnetic separation with most probable number (MPN), and postenrichment direct streak with MPN, all using CT-SMAC. The mean concentration of Nal-resistant E. coli O 157 in samples (n = 59) by use of the GS was 3. 6 log 10 CFU/g. The <b>preenrichment</b> streak detected > 3. 0 log 10 CFU/g samples with a 74. 4 % sensitivity and 68. 8 % specificity. Postenrichment direct streak-MPN and immunomagnetic separation-MPN concentrations were correlated significantly with GS concentrations (r = 0. 53 and r = 0. 39, respectively). In experiment 2 (480 samples), pre- and postenrichment direct streaking performed in triplicate and spiral plating on CT-SMAC were evaluated. For <b>preenrichment</b> streaks, sensitivity was 79. 7 % and specificity was 96. 7 % for detecting > 3. 0 log 10 CFU/g when the criterion was positive cultures {{on at least two}} plates.

Feed samples were collected from feed bunks from 54 feedlots to determine the prevalence of E. coli O 157 in cattle feeds. TSB <b>preenrichment</b> followed by TSB with antibiotics and the standard GN broth enrichment were used for each feed sample. All samples underwent immunomagnetic separation and were plated onto sorbitol MacConkey agar with cefixime and potassium tellurite. Identification of E. coli O 157 was based on indole production, positive latex agglutination for O 157 antigen, API 20 E test strip results, PCR for the eaeA gene, and the presence of at least one Shiga toxin. E. coli O 157 was detected in 52 of 504 feed samples (10. 3 %) by using GN broth enrichment and in 46 of 504 feed samples (9. 1 %) by using TSB followed by TSB supplemented with cefixime and vancomycin.

Therefore, 555 samples from 115 batches of minced beef and pork from a European Union-licensed meat-processing plant were screened for the occurrence of VRE. The processed meat came from 45 different slaughterhouses in Germany. Enterococci were isolated directly from Enterococcosel selective agar plates and also from Enterococcosel selective agar plates supplemented with 32 mg of vancomycin per liter. In addition, peptone broth was used in a <b>preenrichment</b> procedure, and samples were subsequently plated onto Enterococcosel agar containing vancomycin.

We have observed that the total analysis time {{can be reduced to}} 48 h by using Salmosyst broth as a liquid medium for both <b>preenrichment</b> and selective enrichment and Rambach agar (RA), a new selective plate medium. In samples of artificially contaminated ground beef Salmonella enteritidis was detected at a concentration of 0. 4 CFU/g (10 CFU/ 25 g) by both a conventional method and the new method. Of 519 samples of foods for sale, 38 were Salmonella positive by both methods while 471 were negative. Nine samples which were negative by the conventional method were positive by the Salmosyst-RA method, while one sample positive by the first method was negative by the last. Therefore, the Salmosyst-RA method showed 97. 9 % sensitivity compared with the 81. 2 % sensitivity of the conventional method. The new method was also highly specific (98 % specificity) in presumptive identification of Salmonella colonies.

We would like to address some concerns we have {{about the validity of}} these data. First, it is of major importance to use controlled and stan-dardized conditions in the evaluation of culture-based screen-ing protocols. During a 2 -month period, 500 surveillance spec-imens were collected from 88 mechanically ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The patients ’ swabs were first streaked on a beta-lactamase screening agar (BLSE) (AES Chemunex, Bruz cedex, France) and then inserted into 5 ml of antibiotic-free Trypticase soy broth (TSB) for overnight incu...|$|E
40|$|An {{immunological}} {{method for}} the detection of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae in drinking water was developed. The method was based on a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with monoclonal antibody immunoglobulin G 2 a 898 against enterobacterial common antigen. The enterobacterial common antigen sandwich ELISA combined with selective <b>preenrichment</b> culture could be performed in only 24 h. Six hundred sixty-eight water samples from a variety of German public water supplies were screened to verify the effectiveness of the new method. Ninety-eight percent of the results obtained by the immunological method could be confirmed by conventional microbiological methods. The immunological method proved to be considerably faster and more specific and sensitive than the standard method specified by the German drinking water regulations...|$|E
40|$|Immunomagnetic {{separation}} {{is a useful}} enrichment method selective for Escherichia coli O 157 cells against non-O 157 E. coli cells from a <b>preenrichment</b> culture. However, E. coli cells are adsorbed onto a solid surface nonspecifically. With the conventional immunomagnetic separation method, this nonspecific adsorption interfered with immunomagnetic separation. It was found that this interference could be reduced with a low-ionic-strength solution. When immunomagnetic separation was carried out with this solution, the proportion of E. coli O 157 cells to non-O 157 E. coli cells increased from 9. 6 to 31. 4 times compared to the proportion obtained by the conventional immunomagnetic separation method. The effectiveness of this solution was successfully evaluated {{by the use of}} E. coli O 157 -spiked samples...|$|E
40|$|An enzyme {{immunoassay}} (EIA) {{in which an}} immunoglobulin A monoclonal antibody from a myeloma (MOPC 467) is used was developed to detect the presence of Salmonella organisms. This myeloma protein binds to a flagellar determinant of the organisms but is not directed toward the H antigens. Of 100 strains tested, 94 % were detectable with this antibody. The EIA, used with MOPC 467, is quick, sensitive, and specific, showing virtually no cross-reactivity to other enteric organisms. Initial screening of antibody reactivity was performed by Ouchterlony gel diffusion with the supernatants of heat-treated Salmonella cultures. After this, an EIA {{was performed on the}} heat extracts with the myeloma protein, which had been directly coupled to alkaline phosphatase. A positive reaction was indicated by the production of a yellow color after the addition of a substrate (p-nitrophenylphosphate), and this was quantitated by determining the absorbance at 405 nm. The EIA proved to be slightly more sensitive than the Ouchterlony analysis. The sensitivity of the EIA is such that as few as 10 (6) Salmonella organisms per ml were detected. This concentration was easily obtained after a 24 -h <b>preenrichment</b> incubation of the sample. Mixtures of Salmonella strains with a 10 x concentration of Escherichia coli did not prevent detection of the Salmonella strains. This EIA can be successfully used to detect contamination of foods, as it was used to detect the intentional contamination of infant formula in these studies. Indications are that the EIA is sensitive enough to detect Salmonella strains in M broth subcultures taken directly from a <b>preenrichment</b> culture. Testing of samples could thus be completed 36 h after culture initiation, rather than after 96 h, the time currently needed...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of a hemolysin-encoding gene, elyA or hlyA, from Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) was detected by PCR in each of 95 strains tested. PCR products of elyA from human STEC isolates of serovars frequently detected in Germany, such as O 157 :H−, O 103 :H 2, O 103 :H−, O 26 :H 11, and O 26 :H−, showed nucleotide sequences identical to previously reported ones for O 157 :H 7 and O 111 :H− strains. Compared to them, four elyA amplicons derived from human isolates of rare STEC serovars showed identity of about 98 % but lacked an AluI restriction site. However, the nucleotide sequence of an amplicon derived from a porcine O 138 :K 81 :H− STEC strain was identical to the corresponding region of hlyA, encoding alpha-hemolysin, from E. coli. This hlyA amplicon showed 68 % identity with the nucleotide sequence of the corresponding elyA fragment. It differed from the elyA PCR product in restriction fragments generated by AluI, EcoRI, and MluI. Of the 95 representative STEC strains, 88 produced hemolysin on blood agar supplemented with vancomycin (30 mg/liter), cefixime (20 μg/liter), and cefsulodin (3 mg/liter) (BVCC). The lowest added numbers of two to six STEC CFU per g of stool or per ml of raw milk were detectable on BVCC plates after seeding of the <b>preenrichment</b> broth, modified tryptic soy broth (mTSB) supplemented with novobiocin (10 mg/liter), with 16 STEC strains. These strains represented the seven prevailing serovars diagnosed from German patients. However, with ground-beef samples, PCR was essential to identify the lowest added numbers of two to six STEC CFU among colonies of hemolyzing Enterobacteriaceae, such as Serratia spp. and alpha-hemolysin-producing E. coli. We conclude that <b>preenrichment</b> of stool and food samples in mTSB for 6 h followed by overnight culturing on BVCC is a simple method for the isolation and presumptive identification of STEC...|$|E
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative {{intracellular}} Grampositive bacterium, {{ubiquitous in}} nature and capable of causing listeriosis in humans and animals. Conventional microbiological techniques and modern molecular approaches are currently used for the isolation and detection of L. monocytogenes in food samples. The {{aim of this study}} was to improve the sensitivity and reproducibility of PCR for the detection of Listeria spp. in milk. For that purpose milk samples were artificially inoculated with serial dilutions of L. monocytogenes 4 b ATCC 19115 and L. innocua ATCC 33090. The results obtained on artificially contaminated milk samples indicated that incubation time and target genes have an influence on the sensitivity of PCR detection. The best results were obtained after 24 h of <b>preenrichment,</b> with primers complementary to the hlyA gene, when it was possible to detect 1 CFU/mL of Listeria spp...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of Listeria monocytogenes in food samples using enrichment and PCR is described. The objectives were {{to determine whether}} the type of enrichment medium has the influence on the results obtained with PCR and to evaluate proposed method by analysing naturally contaminated food samples. Comparative evaluation of different enrichment media for bacteria of the genus Listeria (half Fraser- HF, buffered peptone water- BPW, triptic soy yeast extract broth- TSBYE, universal <b>preenrichment</b> broth- UPB) showed that only the UPB enabled {{detection of}} L. monocytogenes in artificially contaminated food samples after 24 h of incubation. The PCR-based method gave equal results as standard cultural method by analysis of naturally contaminated food samples. Described PCR-based procedure is comparable to some other PCR-based methods of L. monocytogenes detection in foods and shows promise as a rapid, routine method which requires 30 - 72 h, whereas cultural methods require 96 - 120 h...|$|E
40|$|An enzyme {{immunoassay}} {{was developed to}} detect Salmonella in foods. Indirect test protocols were developed for use with microtitration plates or Gilford microcuvettes. Samples from enrichment cultures were mixed with H-specific immunoglobulin G and allowed to react; unbound antibody was removed by three 5 -min centrifugation washes; goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was added and allowed to react; and unbound conjugate was removed by centrifugation washing as before. Salmonella-positive samples were indicated by {{the production of a}} chromogenic reaction product after the addition of alkaline phosphatase substrate. The color could be read visually or quantified by absorbance. Ninety-eight food samples were examined to compare the {{enzyme immunoassay}} with enrichment serology, immunofluorescence, and the Food and Drug Administration pure culture technique. The enzyme immunoassay was sensitive and specific, and it possessed advantages over methods currently in use. Furthermore, when the enzyme immunoassay was used to screen <b>preenrichment</b> media, the results indicated that it might be decidedly more sensitive than the conventional pure culture technique...|$|E
