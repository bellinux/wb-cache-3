40|$|The {{traditional}} <b>pickle</b> <b>process</b> of Zhacai {{was thought}} unsafely and unstable, {{because of the}} high salt and nitrite contents. The study has shown a method to solve these problems. One Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) strain, Lactobacillus plantarum was used as starter in the low salt <b>pickle</b> <b>process</b> of Chinese Zhacai. The LAB inoculation amounts were 2, 5, 8 %, respectively and the group without LAB inoculation was set as the control. The inoculation groups were added with 8 % salt, while the control group 10 %. The dynamic changes of physical and chemical parameters of two groups were detected during the <b>pickle</b> <b>process.</b> The results showed that: pH value of the inoculated groups declined rapidly, the lowest pH value was 3. 61; the LAB became the predominant bacteria strains during the pickle and the colony amounts of the inoculated groups could be up to 6. 32 log 10 cfu/mL; the nitrite content of each group kept rising and the nitrite peaks of the inoculated groups appeared 3 days in advance, but the peak values were nearly half of the control group; amino nitrogen contents were lower but finally higher than control group and the highest value could reach 0. 46 g/ 100 mL finally. Therefore, the inoculated groups with the lower salt could be more safety and better flavor. This study provided important reference to optimize the <b>pickle</b> fermentation <b>process</b> of Chinese Zhacai...|$|R
50|$|In many {{traditional}} <b>pickling</b> <b>processes,</b> vegetables are submerged in brine, and salt-tolerant Lactobacillus species feed on natural sugars {{found in the}} vegetables.

40|$|The {{electroless}} plating Ni–P is prepared {{on the surface}} of Mg– 7. 5 Li– 2 Zn– 1 Y alloys with different <b>pickling</b> <b>processes.</b> The microstructure and properties of Ni–P coating are investigated. The results show that the Ni–P coatings deposited using the different <b>pickling</b> <b>processes</b> have a different high phosphorus content amorphous Ni–P solid solution structure, and the Ni–P coatings exhibit higher hardness. There is higher phosphorus content of Ni–P amorphous coating using 125  g/L CrO 3 and 110  ml/L HNO 3 (w= 68 %) than using 180  g/L CrO 3 and 1  g/L KF during pre-treatment, and the coating structure is more compact, and the Ni–P coatings exhibit more excellent adhesion with substrate (Fc up to 22  N). The corrosion potential of Ni–P coating is improved and exhibits good corrosion resistance. As a result, Mg- 7. 5 Li- 2 Zn- 1 Y alloy is remarkably protected by the Ni–P coating...|$|R

50|$|In {{chemical}} pickling, {{the food}} is placed in an edible liquid that inhibits or kills bacteria and other microorganisms. Typical pickling agents include brine (high in salt), vinegar, alcohol, and vegetable oil.

Common chemically pickled foods include cucumbers, peppers, corned beef, herring, and eggs, as well as mixed vegetables such as piccalilli.|$|R
40|$|In CFRP primary {{spacecraft}} structures {{the fraction}} of fibres aligned in load direction is limited due to the material’s notch and impact sensitivity. As a result, stiffness and strength per unit weight of the laminate on a given direction are lower than the corresponding values for a unidirectional composite. The present investigations show that the on-axis residual strength after impact can be increased significantly by interleaving thin steel foils in the UD-laminate. Grit-blasting, as a common pre-treatment process for stainless steel surfaces, is not feasible for thin foils due to the increased risk of damaging the metallic substrate. Therefore, different <b>pickling</b> <b>processes</b> are investigated as a non-mechanical alternative pre-treatment. Thus, superior adhesion properties are achieved compared to mechanical pre-treatments...|$|R

The liquid in question, the 'marinade', can be either acidic (made with ingredients such as vinegar, lemon juice, or wine) or enzymatic (made with ingredients such as pineapple, papaya or ginger).
