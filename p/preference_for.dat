Firstly, both <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> rewarding and <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> punishing can survive in evolution provided individuals interact within separate groups. This holds even with randomly formed groups and even when individual preferences are unobservable. Secondly, <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> rewarding survive only in coexistence with self-interested <b>preferences,</b> but <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> punishing tend either to vanish or to dominate the population entirely. Finally, the evolution of <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> rewarding {{and the evolution of}} <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> punishing influence each other decisively. The existence of rewarders enhances the evolutionary success of punishers, but punishers crowd out rewarders...|$|R

30|$|The {{stabilizing}} {{effect of}} similar activities supports theories of marriage predicated upon <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> household (especially non-rival) goods. The {{results suggest that}} spouses are better matched when their <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> activities overlap. We caution that <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> work activities must be representative of <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> goods to make this conclusion truly sound. Models of marriage based on non-rival household goods fit nicely with this result since they are particularly likely to be experiential in nature, e.g., leisure activities and spending time with children. <b>Preferences</b> <b>for</b> these non-rival household activities therefore would reasonably be assumed {{to be related to}} <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> work activities. This is reflected strongly in our results as the results hold regardless of whether the spouses are currently working. Thus, preferences proxied by past occupational experiences do not yield notably different results than estimates using current occupation.|$|R
40|$|Symmetry and masculinity {{in human}} faces have been {{proposed}} to be cues {{to the quality of}} the owner. Accordingly, symmetry is generally found attractive in male and female faces and femininity is attractive in female faces. Women’s <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> male facial masculinity vary in ways that may maximise genetic benefits to women’s offspring. Here we examine same- and opposite-sex <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> both traits (Study 1) and intercorrelations between <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> symmetry and sexual dimorphism in faces (Study 1, Study 2) using computer manipulated faces. For symmetry, we found that male and female judges preferred symmetric faces more when judging faces of the opposite-sex than when judging same-sex faces. A similar pattern was seen for sexual dimorphism (i. e. women preferred more masculine male faces than men did), but women also showed stronger <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> femininity in female faces than men reported. This suggests that women are more concerned with female femininity than are men. We also found that in women <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> symmetry were positively correlated with <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> masculinity in male faces and that in men <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> symmetry were positively correlated with <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> femininity in female faces. These latter findings suggest that symmetry and sexual dimorphism advertise a common quality in faces or that <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> these facial cues are dependent on a common quality in the judges. Collectively, our findings support the view that <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> symmetry and sexual dimorphism are related to mechanisms involved in sexual selection and mate choice rather than functionless by-products of other perceptual mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{is important}} in mate choice in many species and can be appraised via multiple traits in any one individual. Thus, one {{question that arises is}} whether sexual dimorphism in different traits influences preferences consistently. Here, we examined human <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> masculinity/femininity in different types of stimuli. For face and body stimuli, images were manipulated to be more or less masculine using computer graphic techniques. Voice stimuli were made more or less masculine by manipulating pitch. For smell, we used variation among male aftershaves as a proxy for manipulating masculinity of real male smell and used relatively masculine/feminine odors. For women, we found that <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> more masculine stimuli were greater for short-term than for long-term relationships across all stimuli types. Further analyses revealed consistency in <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> masculinity across stimuli types, at least for short-term judgments, whereby women with <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> masculinity in one domain also had <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> masculinity in the other domains. For men, we found that <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> more feminine stimuli were greater for short-term than for long-term judgments across face and voice stimuli, whereas the reverse was true for body stimuli. Further analyses revealed consistency in <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> masculinity across stimuli types for long-term judgments, whereby men with <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> femininity in one domain also had <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> femininity in the other domains.

40|$|Mating <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> genetic {{compatibility}} strictly {{depend on}} the interplay of the genotypes of potential partners and are therein fundamentally different from directional <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> ornamental secondary sexual traits. Thus, the most compatible partner is on average not the one with most pronounced ornaments and vice versa. Hence, mating preferences may often conflict. Here, we present {{a solution to this}} problem while investigating the interplay of mating <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> relatedness (a compatibility criterion) and large body size (an ornamental or quality trait). In previous experiments, both sexes of Pelvicachromis taeniatus, a cichlid fish with mutual mate choice, showed <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> kin and large partners when these criteria were tested separately. In the present study, test fish were given a conflicting choice between two potential mating partners differing in relatedness as well as in body size {{in such a way that}} <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> both criteria could not simultaneously be satisfied. We show that a sex-specific trade-off occurs between mating <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> body size and relatedness. For females, relatedness gained greater importance than body size, whereas the opposite was true for males. We discuss the potential role of the interplay between mating <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> relatedness and body size for the evolution of inbreeding preference...|$|R

40|$|Women's <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> {{masculine}} {{characteristics in}} men's voices and men's <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> feminine characteristics in women's voices {{are thought to}} reflect adaptations that identify high quality (e. g., healthy) mates. Consistent with this proposal, here we show that men demonstrate stronger <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> women's voices with raised pitch (i. e., feminised female voices) than women do and that women demonstrate stronger <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> men's voices with lowered pitch (i. e., masculinised male voices) than men do. Importantly, however, no such opposite-sex bias was evident for attributions of dominance to voices with raised and lowered pitch; men's and women's voices with lowered pitch were perceived to be more dominant than those with raised pitch and these effects were equivalent {{for male and female}} listeners. Collectively, our findings suggest that <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> voice pitch may function, at least in part, to identify high quality mates and show that opposite-sex biases in <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> voice pitch cannot be explained simply by greater general sensitivity to manipulated pitch in opposite-sex voices than in own-sex voices...|$|R
