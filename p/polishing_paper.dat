30|$|The {{performance}} was measured for all catalysts fabricated with different parameters. The PtRu catalyst was deposited on the TiO 2 -CNF catalyst support for evaluation by electrochemical measurements. These measurements were obtained using a three-electrode cell system, which uses cyclic voltammetry (CV) {{to examine the}} catalyst activity in the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) using an Autolab electrochemical workstation. The three-electrode cell system was operated at room temperature and involved a Pt, silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl), and glassy carbon electrode (GCE, 3  mm diameter) as the counter, reference, and working electrode. Before starting the measurement, the GCE was cleaned with alumina and <b>polishing</b> <b>paper,</b> tracing a rounded pattern resembling the number “eight,” several times. Then, the GCE was rinsed with DI water and sonicated for 30  s before use. The catalyst ink for the GCE was prepared by dispersing 15  mg of catalyst into a mixture of 400  μl DI water, 400  μl IPA, and 125  μl Nafion solution (5  wt%) for 30  min. Then, 2.5  μl of catalyst ink was coated onto the GCE using a micropipette and dried for 1  h at room temperature before being heated at 80  °C for another 30  min. The electrolyte was a solution of 0.5  M H 2 SO 4 in 2  M methanol, and it was bubbled for 20  min with nitrogen gas to remove any oxygen. The CV measurement was performed over a potential range of −[*] 0.1 – 1.1  V vs. Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 50  mVs− 1.|$|E
40|$|Aqueous {{electrochemical}} processes at {{the surface}} of the high temperature superconductor YBa~Cu~ 0 ~ (I), including deposition of Ag a~d ~g~-~ave been reported (2, 3). This superconductor dissolves spontaneously under acidic conditions (4) and Ba dissolves and oxide films form during anodization in neutral and basic electrolytes (5). An additional complication for electrodeposition of metals onto YBa_Cu_ 0 ~ is the competing reduction of the su~st~a~e x (2, 3). We report here the electrodeposition of polypyrrole from acetonitrile (MeCN) onto YBa~Cu~ 0 ~. Since polypyrrole is formed by oxi~at~o~-~f pyrrole, the substrate is not reduced at the potentials employed. For comparison, deposition of Ag from MeCN is also discussed. Samples of YBa^Cu_O ~ were prepared in. -x our laboratory by grin~i~g Y 20 ~ (Alfa, Ultrapure) and CuO (Alfa, reagent) with a small quantity of i wt. % Triton X-lO 0 in distil led water. After drying at 90 ~ the powder was heated in air to 950 ~ for 7 h and slowly cooled. The resulting black powder was pressed into 4. 6 mm diameter cylindrical pellets approximately 5 mm in length at 200, 000 psi under vacuum. The pellets were reheated in air to 930 ~ for 4 h and cooled to and held at 390 ~ for 3 h. The pellets showed a sharp drop to zero resistance at 95 ~ using four-probe methods. Employing a SQUID magnetometer, the Meissner signal for the pellet was found to be 30 % of the shielding signal.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to develop novel micro and nano polymer {{substrates}} through different surface patterning techniques to compare their effect on human lung fibroblast (LL 24) and bovine aorta endothelium (BAE- 1) cell behaviours. The cells ability to adhere, proliferate and migrate were studied {{through the use of}} MTT assays and live cell tracking. Laser processing in a directional manner resulted in polyurethane surfaces having a ploughed field effect with micron-scale features a novel surface. In contrast, abrasive polishing in a directional and random manner resulted in polyurethane surfaces having sub-micron scale features orientated in a linear or random manner. The cell results showed that for both the LL 24 and BAE- 1 cells the laser and randomly organised abrasive surface prompted cell adhesion when compared to the linear polished surface and non-patterned surfaces. The linear polished features did not enhance cell proliferation for wither cell type when compared to the flat surface. For cell migration a clear difference can be seen between the cell types with the LL 24 cells showing a decrease in cell migration on the laser and random abrasive surface. The BAE- 1 cells showed enhanced migration on the non-patterned surface when compared to the other surfaces. This work was expanded to include different polished surfaces through the use of different grades of <b>polishing</b> <b>paper.</b> The results for the LL 24 cells showed that though the polished surfaces promoted adhesion when compared to the non-patterned surface there was no clear difference between the surfaces for cell proliferation and migration. The BAE- 1 cells results showed a similarity to the LL 24 cells with the polished surfaces promoting adhesion when compared to the non-patterned surface. There was a clear distinction for the proliferation results with the LL 24 cells showing enhanced proliferation on the scratched surface, this is in contrast to the BAE- 1 cells which were enhanced on the non-patterned surfaces compared to the scratched surfaces. A final study was performed to introduce the use of machine grinding to generate surfaces with micro-sized features and their ability to affect cell behaviour. Results are presented which show that polyurethane castings of the ground surfaces can promote LL 24 cell adhesion and migration, demonstrating that this method can be a cost effective technique to be used in this field...|$|E
40|$|Animals {{have evolved}} {{different}} adhesive structures on their legs to adhere on {{to a wide}} variety of substrates during locomotion. But some plant surfaces have evolved structures that hamper the attachment of animals. Knowledge of morphology, ultra-structure, surface structure and physical properties such as stiffness and elasticity are essential for understanding both of these two systems. The aim of this study was to characterize the surface structures and properties of adhesive organs and of slippery plant surfaces. In the first part of this study the morphology and ultra-structural setup of two different adhesive organs and of an anti-adhesive surface were characterised by using various microscopic techniques. Both animals under inverstigation, the Indian stick insect Carausius morosus and the Australian tree frog Litoria caerulea, possess adhesive organs classified as “smooth pads”. The adhesive organ of the stick insects, the arolium, revealed to consist of a layered setup. Underneath the surface with its fine longitudinal ridges the pads showed a construction of several layers. A thin epicuticular layer was situated on a loose fibrous structure consisting of stiff fibres embedded in a soft matrix. These fibres originated from thick principal rods within the endocuticle. They were oriented perpendicular to the surface within the thick procuticle and branch into finer fibres near the surface. The adhesive organ of the tree frog is macroscopically smooth but revealed to consist of flat-topped epithelial cells that form a hexagonal pattern at higher magnification. The hexagons are also structured by a tightly packed array of so called nanopillars. Those were found to be approximately as tall as wide and exhibit a characteristic dimple on the top. The cytoskeletal elements of the epithelia cells appeared as a sponge-like structure with smaller pore-diameters near the surface. The anti-adhesive surface of the pitcher plant Nepenthes alata is characterized by a continuous wax-layer that covers the inner surface of the conductive zone of the pitchers. Focused ion beam cuttings revealed a sponge-like appearance of the wax layer with cross-linkings of the wax crystals that, at the outermost part of the layer, are orientated perpendicular to the surface. The whole wax layer had a thickness of about 3 µm. In the second part of the study the mechanical properties of the adhesive organs and the plant surface were determined by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques. The arolium consists of two layers with different mechanical properties. The soft (mean Eeff of 12 kPa) outermost layer is about 100 - 300 nm thick, while the subjacent layer is much stiffer (mean Eeff of 600 kPa). AFM contact mode imaging revealed that the cuticle is mechanically anisotropic. We propose that the described layered structure of smooth adhesive pads, consisting of materials decreasing in elasticity towards the outer surface, represents a superior design to conform and adhere to substrates with roughness at different length scales. The toe pad, also soft and easily deformable, shows a somehow “inverse” setup regarding its mechanical properties: the outermost layer (first 300 nm) has an effective Young’s modulus equivalent to silicon rubber (mean Eeff = 14. 4 ± 20. 9 MPa; median Eeff = 5. 7 MPa). Former studies with indentation depths of 50 – 350 µm show a much lower E-modulus (4 – 20 kPa). The functions of this kind of cuticle is discussed in terms of maximising adhesive and frictional forces by conforming closely to surface irregularities at different length scales and maintaining an extremely thin fluid layer between pad and substrate. The anti-adhesive surface of N. alata turned out to withstand high mechanical loads without breaking. The platelet-shaped crystals of the wax-surface stayed stabile under a maximum mechanical load of FN= 250 nN, which is a far higher load than an ant (as the natural prey) would generate even when hanging vertically with just one claws on one single crystal of the surface. The mechanical stability was underlined by slip-off experiments that resulted in only minor amounts of crystal fragments on the adhesive organs of insects slipped down on the conductive surface. In the third part of the study we characterised and compared the anti-adhesive properties of the surface of the conductive zone of a pitcher and surfaces of <b>polishing</b> <b>paper</b> with different grain sizes. We were able to show that the surface profile parameters of the wax-surface were comparable to those of P 4000 <b>polishing</b> <b>paper.</b> Both surfaces were sufficient to inhibit the adhesion of insects. Based on those finding we developed a theoretical model that describes a surface with a roughness of a certain length scale that prevents attachment of insects. On the one hand the roughness of such a surface is not high enough for an insect to adhere using its claws. On the other hand the roughness is too high for the arolium to deform into the profile to maximize the contact area to gain sufficient adhesion. In the last part I characterized the chemical composition of the tarsal secretion of C. morosus, as it plays an important role for adhesion on rough surfaces. Using different analytical techniques as solid phase micro extraction, gas chromatography, mass spectroscopy and Fourier-transform-interference-spectroscopy several components of the secretion were identify. The results suggest that the secreted liquid mainly consists of long chained alkanes, fatty acids, hexadecanoic acid and water. The non-polar substances seemed to form micelles within the water which generally appear as small droplets in light microscopy. The ratio of polar and non-polar components within this emulsion could affect the physical properties of the liquid and therefore the effectiveness of its adhesive properties...|$|E

40|$|The present {{thesis is}} based on a scientifically-informed, contextualized and historicized reading of Ludwik Fleck. In {{addition}} to his monograph, the material studied includes his additional philosophical writings, his internationally-published scientific articles and two, thus-far-unstudied postwar <b>Polish</b> <b>papers</b> related to his Buchenwald experiences. The sources provided by Fleck have been traced back to the time of their origin. Based on the above material, it is argued that, rather than relativizing science and deeply influencing Kuhn, Fleck, attempting to participate in the current debates, is an ardent proponent of science, offering an internal account of its pursuit that accords with his oft-contested epistemic concepts, e. g., Denkzwang, Sinnsehen and Kopplungen. The exposure of his description of the Wassermann reaction discloses a highly selective reading of the sources available at the time, but also reveals its relation to the current debate on Einzelwissenschaften, or the standing of new emerging disciplines versus age-old ones, all occasioned by the remarkable progress of science that has also affected philosophy. The divide between philosophers and scientists on the philosophical implications of modern physics is exposed, as is Fleck’s heuristic use of the latter topic in his epistemology. A more realistic account of his often-valued scientific accomplishments is provided. It is argued that the modern interpretation or received humanist view of Fleck {{is based on}} the opposition, at the time Fleck’s monograph was rediscovered, of STS writers to a scientifically-informed reading of his texts. An additional corrective to the received view of Fleck is found in some of his postwar <b>Polish</b> <b>papers</b> related his Buchenwald experiences. The latter might also provide an answer to some of the contradictions inherent in the modern mythology surrounding Fleck. In amply exposing the precarious situation of the time, and the complexity of the ethical issues at stake, Fleck’s papers in fact generate age-old philosophical questions still worth contemplating.
