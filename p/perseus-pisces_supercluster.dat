40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} new method of bias {{correction}} for deriving reliable Tully-Fisher distances in a magnitude or diameter selected sample of field galaxies. This normalized distance method (NDM) is first {{presented in a}} theoretical way using the formalism of bayesian statistics and is further applied to three different Tully-Fisher samples corresponding to three different passbands in B, I and r. Constraints imposed by the method, and influences of underlying assumptions and measurement errors are discussed in detail. A main feature of the methodology is to extract an unbiased subsample from the parent sample. We show that by taking into account all the components influencing the bias at a given distance, the NDM method allows to extend the unbiased range and to analyze peculiar velocities of galaxies within a sphere out to 8000 km s(- 1) around the Local Group. Finally, thanks to this tool, we show first evidences for both frontside and backside large amplitude infall toward the <b>Perseus-Pisces</b> <b>supercluster.</b> The strong convergent flow expected in the Great Attractor region is not confirmed, even if infall centers are detected in this direction.

40|$|By {{correcting}} the redshift–dependent distances for peculiar motions through some peculiar velocity field models, we recover the true distances of an extensive, all-sky sample of nearby galaxies (∼ 6400 galaxies with recession velocities cz < 5500 km s − 1), which is complete {{up to the}} apparent limiting blue magnitude B = 14 mag. Relying on available catalogs of galaxy groups, we treat ∼ 2700 objects as members of galaxy groups and the remaining objects as field galaxies. We invert the derived redshift-distance relations to estimate distances for field galaxies and groups and we overcome the ambiguity inherent to the triple-valued zones by using Tully-Fisher relations calibrated on suitably defined samples of galaxies having distances predicted by peculiar velocity models.

The resulting redshift distribution reveals various new structures that were hitherto uncharted. They seem to form part of the larger <b>Perseus-Pisces</b> <b>Supercluster</b> (PPS). The most conspicuous is a ridge at about ℓ≈ 160 ^∘,v ≈ 6500 km/s. Within this wall-like structure, two strong radio galaxies (3 C 129 and 3 C 129. 1) are embedded which lie at the same distance as the ridge. They seem to form part of an X-ray cluster.

40|$|Based on the {{systematic}} HI follow-up survey of 2 MASS bright {{galaxies in the}} Zone of Avoidance (ZoA) with the Nançay Radio Telescope (NRT), a prominent galaxy overdensity crossing the Galactic Plane at longitudes of l ≈ 160 ° was discovered. This filamentary overdensity {{is part of the}} expansive <b>Perseus-Pisces</b> <b>Supercluster</b> (PPS; cz ~ 6000 km/s). Within it an X-ray galaxy cluster mostly known as the 3 C 129 cluster is embedded. The cluster hosts two strong radio galaxies with bent morphologies, which is indicative of a rich intracluster medium. Despite it being a potentially rich cluster and part of the larger PPS, very little was known about its galaxy composition because of the high Galactic dust extinction in the ZoA. For this PhD project the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) was used to blindly map this ZoA crossing of the PPS in the 21 cm HI-wavelength. The survey was conducted through 35 individual pointings observed for a total of 420 hours, covering a large area of about 9. 6 sq. deg and a velocity range of approximately cz ~ 2000 - 16000 km/s. Over 200 galaxies were detected in HI distributed over various substructures, covering a range of cosmic environments within the survey volume.

The Wiener reconstruction of the density field is also the optimal reconstruction (in the minimum variance sense) of any quantity which is linear in the density contrast.

40|$|Streaming {{motions of}} galaxies and {{clusters}} provide the only method for probing {{the distribution of}} mass, as opposed to light, on scales of 20 - 100 h(^- 1) Mpc. This thesis presents a new survey of the local peculiar velocity field, based upon Fundamental Plane (FP) distances for an all-sky sample of 56 clusters to cz = 12000 km s(^- 1). Central velocity dispersions have been determined from new spectroscopic data for 429 galaxies. From new R-band imaging data the FP photometric parameters (effective diameter and effective surface brightness) have been measured for 324 galaxies. The new spectroscopic and photometric data have been carefully combined with an extensive body of measurements compiled from the literature, to yield a closely homogeneous catalogue of FP data for 725 early type galaxies. Fitting the inverse FP relation to the merged catalogue yields distance estimates with a scatter of 22 % per galaxy, resulting in cluster distance errors of 2 - 13 %. The distances are consistent, on a cluster-by-cluster basis, with those determined from Tully-Fisher-Fisher studies and from earlier FP determinations. The distances are marginally inconsistent with distance estimates based on brightest cluster galaxies, but this disagreement {{can be traced to}} a few highly discrepant clusters. The resulting peculiar velocity field is dominated by a bulk streaming component, with amplitude of 810 ± 180 km s(^- 1) (directed towards l = 260,b = - 5), a result which is robust against a range of potential systematic effects. The flow direction is ~ 35 from the CMB dipole and ~ 15 from the X-ray cluster dipole direction. Two prominent superclusters (the Shapley Concentration and the Horologium-Reticulum Supercluster) may contribute significantly to the generation of this flow. More locally, there is no far- side infall into the 'Great Attractor' (GA), apparently due to the opposing pull of the Shapley Concentration. A simple model of the flow in this direction suggests that the GA region generates no more than ~ 60 % of the Local Group's motion in this direction. Contrary to some previous studies, the <b>Perseus-Pisces</b> <b>supercluster</b> is found to exhibit no net streaming motion. On small scales the velocity field is extremely quiet, with an rms cluster peculiar velocity of < 270 km s(^- 1) in the frame defined by the bulk-flow. The results of this survey suggest that very distant mass concentrations contribute significantly to the local peculiar velocity field. This result is difficult to accommodate within currently popular cosmological models, which have too little large-scale power to generate the observed flow. The results may instead favour models with excess fluctuation power on 60 - 150 h(^- 1) Mpc scales...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study a {{structure}} {{associated with the}} <b>Perseus-Pisces</b> <b>Supercluster</b> (PPS; cz ~ 6000 km s⁻¹), where it crosses the Zone of Avoidance (ZoA) at the Galactic longitude of ℓ ≈ 160 ᵒ. This largely unexplored region contains the X-ray emitting 3 C 129 cluster which hosts two strong radio sources with bent morphologies, thus indicative of a rich intra-cluster medium (ICM). Due to its low Galactic latitude of b = 0. 27, where Galactic extinction is severe at optical wavelengths (AB = 1. 8 − 8. 0), the details of its galaxy population and dynamics had not been investigated in detail before. Additionally, the diverse and dynamic cosmic environments of the PPS with the embedded galaxy cluster make this region an ideal laboratory to study the effects on these environments on the galaxy properties and galaxy transformation processes therein. We used the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) to blindly map this ZoA crossing of the PPS in the 21 cm HI-wavelength. This was conducted through 35 individual pointings observed {{for a total of}} 420 hours, covering a large area of about 9. 6 sq. deg and a velocity range of approximately cz ~ 2000 − 16000 km s⁻¹, thus mapping the immediate surrounding regions to enable investigations of the various cosmic environmental effects on the HI properties of galaxies. With the resulting spectral line data cubes of an angular resolution of 23 " x 16 " and a velocity resolution of 16. 5 km s⁻¹ with a rms sensitivity of ~ 0. 4 mJy/beam, we detect 211 galaxies within the entire surveyed volume. These new HI detections reveal a total of four distinct overdensities. Of these overdensities, the two major ones are located at the distance of the PPS at cz ~ 4000 − 8000 km s⁻¹ and behind it at cz ~ 8000 − 12000 km s− 1. The galaxy overdensity associated with the PPS is used to demonstrate how this supercluster connects across the ZoA and confirms earlier indications of a filamentary connection between Perseus, Pisces and the A 569 clusters through this region of the sky. Galaxies in the background of the PPS seem {{to be part of the}} CID 15 structure that had been earlier predicted in the reconstructed density and velocity maps from the 2 MASS Redshift Survey. We carry out a detailed census of the galaxy population in the 3 C 129 cluster by combining the HI-data of the gas-rich galaxies with the near-infrared (NIR) images of the gas-poor galaxies. The NIR galaxies are identified from the high resolution (0. 2 "/pix, seeing ~ 0. 8 ") images of the UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey. We obtain photometry in the J,H and K bands for about 9700 galaxies identified in the NIR images within the WSRT HI surveyed area. These measurements are used to derive the red-sequence of this cluster through the (J − K) vs K colour-magnitude diagram to identify the gas-poor cluster member candidates. Within the spatial extent of the cluster of radius ~ 1. 7 Mpc, a total of 261 galaxies are identified as cluster members, with 23 detected in HI. An assessment of the morphologies of these galaxy members reveals a clear morphological segregation, with E and E/S 0 galaxies dominating the inner regions of the 3 C 129 cluster and the late-type spirals found in the cluster outskirts. We also examine the richness of the cluster by comparing it to two well-known clusters at similar redshifts. One being a massive cluster in the Great Attractor region, namely the Norma cluster, also located in the ZoA but in the South, and the other being the Coma cluster. The comparison shows that the 3 C 129 cluster is quite rich as was suspected. The galaxy density in the core of the 3 C 129 cluster is similar to that in the Norma cluster and slightly less than in the Coma cluster. Furthermore, an assessment of the spatial distribution of galaxies in the core shows a slight asymmetry aligned with the irregular distribution of the X-ray emission, thus consistent with the results from the X-ray analysis which surmised that the 3 C 129 cluster seems to have undergone a merger and has not yet reached a dynamically relaxed state. In support of this we find a large substructure dominated by gas-rich galaxies North of the main cluster at a slightly higher recession velocity which could be falling into the cluster. All these findings seem to support a scenario where the 3 C 129 cluster is still growing through accretion of galaxies from the PPS filament. The wealth of HI data allows an analysis of the environmental effects on the galaxy properties within the WSRT surveyed volume. We first characterise the cosmic environments found within the two major overdensities as outlined by the HI-detected galaxies. This is conducted by perfoming tests to search for substructures. A total of four distinct substructures are found within the PPS ZoA overdensity (cz ~ 4000 − 8000 km s− 1) and three in the background galaxy overdensity (cz ~ 8000 − 12000 km s− 1). Our analysis of the HI properties of galaxies in these varying cosmic environments shows that highly disturbed HI-disks are found in larger and tightly bound groups, due to the higher incidence of tidal interactions between the galaxies. Furthermore, an indication of HI-gas deficiency is found in the core of the 3 C 129 cluster. We assess the cause of this deficiency through models of the ICM of the 3 C 129 cluster and find ram-pressure stripping to be the dominant gas removal process in this region. Additionally, highly HI-gas deficient galaxies are also found in the cluster outskirts. Most of these galaxies are located within galaxy groups where galaxy-galaxy interactions and mergers are prevalent, thus highlighting the importance of these processes in removing gas from galaxies in groups...|$|E
