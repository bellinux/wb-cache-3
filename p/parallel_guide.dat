40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to generate the knowledge required to adapt macro- and microscale compliant mechanism theory to design carbon nanotube-based nano-scale compliant mechanisms. Molecular simulations of a nano-scale <b>parallel</b> <b>guiding</b> mechanism uncovered three regions of behavior. Region I is governed by the bulk deformation of the carbon nanotubes. Region II is characterized by hinge-like flexing of four "kinks" that occur due to buckling of the carbon nanotube walls. Region III, an intermediate region, exhibits direction dependant behavior. We report on the ability of a conventional compliant mechanism modeling approach, the pseudo-rigid-body model, to predict the region I behavior of a nano-scale <b>parallel</b> <b>guiding</b> mechanism that uses single-walled (5, 5) carbon nanotubes as the flexural elements. Van der Waals forces were found to affect the kinematic and elastomechanic behavior of the nano-scale <b>parallel</b> <b>guiding</b> mechanism. A modified value of the pseudo-rigid-body model stiffness coefficient is presented to capture the affect of van der Waals interactions within (5, 5) nanotubes during region I operation. (cont.) Molecular simulation of region I behaviors match the modified pseudo-rigid-body model predictions of (1) kinematic behavior with less than 7. 3 % error and (2) elastomechanic behavior with less than 8 % error. Although region I is of the most interest because of its well-defined and stable nature, region II motion is also investigated to provide a basis for establishing future work in this region. by Christopher M.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} the Rolamite architecture exploiting shape-memory alloys {{as power}} element {{to obtain a}} solid-state actuator. The Rolamite mechanism was discovered in the late 1960 s, initially as precision and low friction linear bearing. The most common Rolamite configuration consists of a flexible thin metal strip and two rollers mounted between two fixed <b>parallel</b> <b>guide</b> surfaces. The system can roll back and forth without slipping guided by the plates along its so-called sensing axis. The system presents another relevant advantage in addition to low friction coefficient, which is the possibility to provide force generation in a quite simple way. In the original literature works, the force was provided, thanks to cut-outs of various shapes in the strip, although this method does not allow the Rolamite {{to be considered a}} proper actuator, but only a force generator. In this article, we developed the idea of exploiting the shape-memory alloy as Rolamite power element, and therefore, to use the shape-memory effect to change the elastic properties of the strip and to provide the actuation force. The mechanical analysis, where the martensite–austenite transition is modelled in a simplified way, shows that this application is feasible, mainly thanks to the initial precurvature of the shape-memory alloy strip. The discussion of the results highlights some important merits of this architecture such as long stroke, constant force and compactness...|$|E
40|$|Background: Neglected femoral neck {{fracture}} in adults still poses a formidable challenge. Existing treatment options varies from osteotomy (with or without graft) to osteosynthesis using various implants and grafting techniques (muscle pedicle, vascularized, and nonvascularized fibula). The {{aim of this}} study was to assess outcome of nonvascularized fibular strut graft and cancellous screw fixation in neglected femoral neck fractures in the younger age group. Materials and Methods: Medical records of 32 patients of neglected femoral neck fracture, in the age group of 22 - 45 years (mean 37. 8 years), operated between May 1994 to December 2001, were retrospectively reviewed. After the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 28 patients having three years minimum follow-up (mean 4. 6 years) were included. Delay between injury and operation varied from four weeks to 42 weeks (mean 16. 4 weeks). Closed reduction was achieved in 17 patients; open reduction through Watson-Jones anterolateral approach was performed in the remaining 15 patients in whom closed reduction failed. The fracture was transfixed with three <b>parallel</b> <b>guide</b> wires. Appropriate sized cannulated lag screw (7 mm) was then inserted in two of the wires. Selection of the third guide wire for fibula depended on the space available in both anteroposterior and lateral view. Results: Satisfactory bony union was obtained in 25 patients, of whom in four cases, the union occurred in 10 - 20 &#x 00 B 0; (mean 15 &#x 00 B 0;) of varus. Nonunion occurred in three patients (9. 37 &#x 0025;), and aseptic necrosis occurred in another six patients (18. 75 &#x 0025;). Of the 25 patients where union was achieved, five patients showed excellent results; 14 good and six had poor functional result, as evaluated using modified Anglen criteria. Conclusion: Nonvascularized fibular strut graft along with cancellous screws provides a dependable and technically less-demanding alternative procedure for neglected femoral neck fractures in young adults. Fibula being cortical provides mechanical strength besides stimulating the union and getting incorporated as biological graft...|$|E

We discuss Hopper in general and present a recently implemented randomized guided search algorithm. In multiple <b>parallel</b> <b>guided</b> searches, randomization increases the expected average time to find an error but decreases the expected minimum time to find an error.

Instead, Hopper explores fundamental algorithms for reducing time and space capacity limitations in state generation and storage.

40|$|An {{adjustable}} diffusion-based microfluidic reactor {{is presented}} here, {{which is based}} on electro-osmotic guiding of reagent samples. The device consists of a laminar flow chamber with two separate reagent inlets. The position and the width of the two sample streams in the flow chamber can be controlled individually by changing the flow ratio of three <b>parallel</b> <b>guiding</b> buffer streams. Since electro-osmotic flow (EOF) is used for pumping, no external pumps or other moving parts are needed. The region where the diffusive profiles of the two sample streams overlap is used for the reactions. This overlapping region can be manipulated in a predictable way by adjusting the voltages required to generate the respective electro-osmotic flow. Reaction dynamics inside the microreactor is illustrated with a reactant pair of a fluorescent calcium tracer and a calcium chloride solution. An analytical model, which is an analogue of electrical circuits to EOF, was developed and embedded into the LabView control software, allowing real-time control of the microreactor.

How {{such a system}} works in coordination is not well understood. Cross-regulatory interactions between different signalling pathways and redundancy between them can increase precision and fidelity of guidance systems. Immunoglobulin superfamily proteins of the NCAM and L 1 families couple specific substrate recognition and cell adhesion with the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases. Thus {{it has been shown}} that L 1 CAM-mediated cell adhesion promotes the activation of the EGFR (erbB 1) from Drosophila to humans. Here we explore the specificity of the molecular interaction between L 1 CAM and the erbB receptor family. We show that L 1 CAM binds physically erbB receptors in both heterologous systems and the mammalian developing brain. Different Ig-like domains located in the extracellular part of L 1 CAM can support this interaction. Interestingly, binding of L 1 CAM to erbB enhances its response to neuregulins. During development this may synergize with the activation of erbB receptors through L 1 CAM homophilic interactions, conferring diffusible neuregulins specificity for cells or axons that interact with the substrate through L 1 CAM. © 2012 Donier et al.

40|$|Study of the {{evolution}} of species or organisms is essential for various biological applications.

Techniques have been developed for building phylogenetic or evolutionary trees for a set of sequences. Though phylogenetic trees capture the overall evolutionary relationships among the sequences, they do not reveal fine-level details of {{the evolution}}. In this work, we attempt to resolve various fine-level sequence transformation details associated with a phylogenetic tree using cellular automata.
