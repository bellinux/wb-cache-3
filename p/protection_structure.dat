500|$|One {{serious threat}} {{to the future of the}} Head is erosion of the exposed {{southern}} cliff face from wind and rain, as well as erosion caused by the sea primarily through the process of Longshore drift. A comparison of Ordnance Survey maps reveals that 25 metres of cliff was washed away from 1915 to 1962, a process accelerated by the Bournemouth cliff's concreted promenade and groynes, construction of which started in the early 20th century. It is thought that in the last 200 years around 150 metres of land has been lost from the head. The first attempt to counteract erosion came in the 1930s when Bournemouth Council constructed a breakwater now known as [...] "the Long Groyne". Since then, a gabion revetment has been constructed to secure the weakest point at the eastern end of the Head. In a long-term project to secure the head's future, from 2005 to 2008 Poole Bay was replenished with 1.8 million cubic metres of beach material, drawing ire from some surfers and beach lovers owing to the increase in sharp stones on Southbourne beach in particular. The project's organizers, the Poole Bay Partnership, state that: [...] "The resulting wide beaches have been a success in terms of their function as a coast <b>protection</b> <b>structure</b> and for the enjoyment they provide to the area's residents and visitors." ...|$|E

Good scaling of the ESD robustness with the device width is observed testifying uniform current distribution along the device structure during the ESD event, however failure analysis carried out on failed structures, shows localized failure, suggesting current crowding phenomena happening at high current regime. We have explained these apparently contradictory results thanks to extensive TLP characterization and failure analysis carried out on tested devices. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
