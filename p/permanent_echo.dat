5000|$|The Wash {{incident}} {{took place}} {{in the early hours of}} 5 October 1996 when a [...] "strange red and green rotating light" [...] was seen by Skegness residents and police officers to the southeast of Skegness, who then contacted the Coastguard at Great Yarmouth. It later involved many RAF stations, including RAF Neatishead, and GCHQ. The object was probably not an aircraft because although it could be seen on radar, it had no transponder. The Skegness News, a local newspaper which no longer exists, investigated the incident and sought confirmation of the object from the Jodrell Bank Observatory. In their report to the RAF, the observatory said that Venus, [...] "the queen of UFOs", which had been shining with exceptional brilliance in the early morning sky to the east, probably explained the light shown on the video. The object was caught on video by Skegness Police. The RAF decided the stationary blip was a <b>permanent</b> <b>echo</b> of the 272 ft tall St Botolph's Church, Boston, and the object on the video was the planet Venus.|$|E

Designed by Renzo Piano, the <b>permanent</b> gallery <b>echoes</b> some of the {{architectural}} features of the Menil Collection, {{such as the use}} of diffused natural light, while retaining its own, separate identity.|$|R

A line of these early warning stations across the north of Canada is visualized to relieve the load on the main defenence system. Two fixed, narrow azimuth, vertical fan beams are directed obliquely from each station in the fence, with an average station separation of 30 miles. Coherent pulse and integration techniques are used to distinguish moving targets from <b>permanent</b> <b>echoes.</b> The antenna pattern is 100 in azimuth and cosecant to 40, 000 ft. The crystal-controlled transmitter emits 5 KM peak, 203 ̆bcs pulses on 600 Mc. Automatic alarm of moving targets is provided with course range discrimination. No operator is needed but maintenance will be required. Ranges up to 70 miles have been obtained on random aircraft, although formal flight trials have not been carried out yet. Under moderate clutter conditions the system is stable, without false alarms, and operates on aircraft echoes 3 db above noise. In severe clutter the operation is not yet entirely satisfactory.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a weather radar siting procedure for a mountainous region in Greece using GIS. The established radar siting objectives consist of the detection and tracking of storms (rainstorms, hailstorms, and snowstorms) requiring operations {{at a low}} elevation angle {{as well as the}} detection of the vertical structure and evolution of a storm. Moreover, the objective includes precipitation intensity measurements and areal precipitation analysis, which is related to the incidence of <b>permanent</b> <b>echoes</b> and obstructions {{as well as to the}} maximum range achievable. Two types of siting criteria are employed; mainly strategic or regional criteria, and local criteria. The strategic criteria mainly consist of set back and communication considerations and local radar siting criteria include the area, geometry or morphology as well as local logistics and practical considerations. In this study, digitized maps of 1 : 100, 000 scale with 100 m contour interval are used. These digitized contour data are used to build the Digital Terrain Model (DTM, raster image) and produce the three-dimensional visualization of the area. The potential sites for the weather radar installation are identified on this three-dimensional DTM. The potential radar sites are located in complex mountainous areas, which results in additional selection difficulties. The selected site and its alternative fulfill the established purposes using the above-mentioned criteria. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
5000|$|... 5 October {{marked the}} start of the 426th's combat deployment; four {{aircraft}} were sent to Chengtu Airfield, China, Upon their arrival the mission of the 426th NFS was night defense for the Twentieth Air Force B-29 Superfortresses based there. The 426th replaced the P-51B Mustangs of the 311th Fighter Group that had escorted the B-29s. However, as the 426th was several aircraft short of its full complement, the 311th transferred eight of its Mustangs to the squadron. By the end of October, the 426th was up-to-strength with P-61s at Chengtu. On 27 October, a detachment of the 426th initiated operations out of Kunming, China, where Fourteenth Air Force was headquartered.The Japanese were well aware of the P-61s effectiveness, however many bomber crews were aware that there were too few of them to cover the entire Chinese front. Another issue faced by the Americans {{was the fact that the}} terrain in China was very rugged and it caused <b>permanent</b> <b>echoes</b> on radar. This made picking out enemy aircraft very difficult, and because of this, the Japanese flew many of their aircraft low to the ground. It was impossible for the P-61s airborne radar to pick up the enemy aircraft without the help of ground-based interceptor radar, so in many areas, the freelance interceptions by the P-61s was almost impossible.|$|R
