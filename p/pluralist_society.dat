25|$|The {{effects of}} the Technical Assistance Program were not limited to {{improvements}} in productive efficiency. While the thousands of European leaders took their work/study trips to the United States, {{they were able to}} observe a number of aspects of American society as well. The Europeans could watch local, state, and federal governments work together with citizens in a <b>pluralist</b> <b>society.</b> They observed a democratic society with open universities and civic societies in addition to more advanced factories and manufacturing plants. The Technical Assistance Program allowed Europeans to bring home many types of American ideas.|$|E
25|$|Within the Roman Catholic Church, {{there has}} existed a {{sometimes}} tense relationship between Jesuits and the Holy See due to questioning of official church teaching and papal directives, {{such as those}} on abortion, birth control, women deacons, homosexuality, and liberation theology. Usually, this theological free thinking is academically oriented, being prevalent at the university level. From this standpoint, the function of this debate is less to challenge the magisterium than to publicize the results of historical research or to illustrate the church's ability to compromise in a <b>pluralist</b> <b>society</b> based on shared values that do not always align with religious teachings. This has not prevented Popes from appointing Jesuits to powerful positions in the church. John Paul II and Benedict XVI together appointed ten Jesuit Cardinals to notable jobs. Under Benedict, Archbishop Luis Ladaria Ferrer was Secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and Federico Lombardi was Vatican Press Secretary.|$|E

30|$|In {{political}} theory, {{the idea}} of procedural justice {{has emerged as a}} way to provide such a framework. The term procedural justice refers to the way procedures (e.g., decision making procedures) are structured so that their outcomes can be considered fair. The term is especially relevant in <b>pluralist</b> <b>societies</b> where people often cannot agree on substantive views on what justice amounts to. An example of procedural justice is the principle that those who are affected by a certain decision be afforded the opportunity to participate in the decision making.|$|R
30|$|Interpretative {{ambiguity}} {{denotes the}} variability of legitimate interpretations based on identical observations or data assessment results, for example, an adverse or nonadverse effect. Variability of interpretation, however, is not restricted to expert dissent. Laypeople’s perception of risk often differs from expert judgments because it is related to qualitative risk characteristics such as familiarity, personal or institutional control, assignment of blame, and others. Moreover, in contemporary <b>pluralist</b> <b>societies</b> diversity of risk perspectives within and between social groups is generally fostered by divergent value preferences, variations in interests, and very few, if any, universally applicable moral principles. Ambiguity becomes all the more prominent, if risk problems are also complex and uncertain.|$|R
40|$|Political {{education}} is a necessary precondition for the continuation of any political regime. In <b>pluralist</b> <b>societies</b> we face the question {{to what extent can}} a liberal democracy define the educational ideal of what “good citizenship” means. Building on the works of Michael Oakeshott and Bernard Crick, this essay shows that political philosophy can help define the parameters of this education when it is seen as a process of building political comprehension and civic dispositions. Political education should be defined by teaching politics as a practical process of living together in a community of equals and espousing the procedural values of discussion, respect for facts, equality and freedom...|$|R

40|$|In <b>pluralist</b> <b>societies</b> {{adhering}} to liberal and individualistic ideas, strict and conservative groups face some serious dilemmas {{if they want}} to recruit and keep members. In a liberal society, the most important form of religious power is normative power. Strict and demanding religious organizations will have difficulties in a liberal, anti-authoritarian society. Such organizations may succeed in increasing their control over loyal members, but in a broader context, they will be branded as authoritarian by the secular media and by general public opinion. This, in turn, will have negative effects on their ability to recruit new members. This line of reasoning is presented in connection with survey data and illustrative cases from present-day Norway. On a theoretical level, the author contests some points of view in rational choice theory stating that strict and profiled religious organizations will tend to have the greatest success...|$|R

It shows that the richness and diversity of the arguments put forward both by the partisans and the opponents of the proposed law exceed the framework of a liberal conception of law and bring into play axiological convictions. Far from interpreting this phenomenon as the sign of a still insufficient liberalisation of the public sphere, the authors see in it the indication that the function of law in <b>pluralist</b> <b>societies</b> cannot be reduced to the mere preservation of subjective rights, but consists equally in the collective affirmation of the values enlightening human existence. However, this makes it necessary to place in perspective the dominant position of the legislator vis-A-vis the social sphere (transl. by J. Dudley) ...|$|R

Believers in Qur'an dispute with these thoughts to change the structure of the society.

Drawing attention to the importance of the rulers and their power, Qur'an advises the believers to follow a method during the conflicts.

40|$|Abstract: In Europe {{the public}} {{role of the}} {{religions}} appears to be directly proportional to the fall in trust in the procedural mechanisms at {{the basis of the}} liberal democracies. Compared to the strong identities attributed to the United States and to the Islamic world Europe is accused of having a weak identity, the fruit of its prescriptive relativism. In this context God returns onto the scene. Nevertheless, a European civil religion risks becoming an instrument of closure of the system rather than responding to the challenges of <b>pluralist</b> <b>societies</b> and it could become a further factor of secularisation of society. christian democracy; civil society; deliberative democracy; democracy; democratization; democratization; diversity/homogeneity; European identity; European public space; governance; ideas; identity; interest intermediation; interest representation; lobbying; minorities; Nation-state; participation; pluralism; public opinion; social democracy; EU Charter of Fundamental Rights; subsidiarity; Amsterdam Treaty; Constitution for Europe; France; Germany; Italy; history; political science; sociology...|$|R

40|$|Compromise {{forms the}} lifeblood of liberal democracies within <b>pluralist</b> <b>societies,</b> yet proves {{problematic}} for liberals and democrats alike. The authors overcome this difficulty by comparing the mutual acceptance sought by negotiators both from a bargain struck by traders for mutual advantage and from an agreement among trimmers to avoid contentious issues. While the last two forms of compromise offend democratic and liberal canons of justice and fairness, the first does not. Through {{an investigation of the}} nature, preconditions and limits of the negotiating process, they indicate what can and what cannot be compromised. They contend compromise so conceived offers a superior liberal response to multiculturalism and pluralism than liberal neutrality can, for neutrality tends to collapse into either a trader's or a trimer's compromise. they illustrate their argument with a discussion of the long historical compromise of America liberal democracy with slavery and its current wrestlings with abortion...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} show the {{analytical}} limitations {{of the most popular}} terms describing the relationship between religion and politics, the two most popular being "separation of church and state" and "separation of religion and politics". Although the latter term is preferred it is still quite vague in its meaning and, strictly speaking, impossible to put into practice. I try to clarify the meaning of "separation of religion and state" by discussing the early writings out of which the tradition arose, those of John Locke and Thomas Jefferson. I contend {{that the best way to}} define the meaning of the separationist doctrine is to place it within the context of the liberalism from which it emerged. This allows the separation of religion and state to be not only possible but also more relevant for <b>pluralist</b> <b>societies</b> and post-colonial societies who wish to avoid both religious domination and complete secularism. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{argues that}} {{everyday}} bordering {{has become a}} major technology of control of both social diversity and discourses on diversity, in a way that threatens the convivial co-existence of <b>pluralist</b> <b>societies,</b> especially in metropolitan cities, as well as reconstructs everyday citizenship. The article begins with an outline of a theoretical and methodological framework, which explores bordering, the politics of belonging and a situated intersectional perspective {{for the study of the}} everyday. It then analyses the shift in focus of recent UK immigration legislation from the external, territorial border to the internal border, incorporating technologies of everyday bordering in which ordinary citizens are demanded to become either border-guards and/or suspected illegitimate border crossers. We illustrate our argument in the area of employment examining the impact of the requirements of the immigration legislation from the situated gazes of professional border officers, employers and employees in their bordering encounters...|$|R

40|$|Social {{and civic}} {{conflict}} {{inspired by the}} fundamental convictions of different religious groups seems to be rife all over the world, also in schools. One way of addressing this problem is to promote inter-religious dialogue. To establish the viability of this solution, the authors take several steps. They analyze the phenomenon “religion” and discover that it is constituted of several layers or levels {{that have to be}} accounted for in the proposed inter-religious dialogue in schools. After discussing the term “dialogue” they consider several approaches to religious diversity or plurality to find a suitable basis for the proposed inter-religious dialogue in schools. Based on these analyses, the authors argue that schools (teacher-educators and learners) should be allowed to engage in inter-religious dialogue as part of their pedagogical and civic duty. This will ensure a better understanding of others and their religions, also at the deepest spiritual level. Such comprehension can contribute to the more peaceful co-existence of people in religiously <b>pluralist</b> <b>societies.</b> [URL]...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNowadays, in {{the process}} of {{globalization}} (Information Revolution) all countries try to achieve inexhaustible resources and development whilst they attempt to improve the level of utilization of their organizations in order to survive. Thus, in this paper, we aim to investigate this topic in Iran. Intercultural studies show that people who grow up in <b>pluralist</b> <b>societies</b> give priority to the advantages of a group; however, people who are raised in individualistic societies, learn to prefer their own benefit over others. Moreover, the studies show that Iranian family samples consider themselves of one’own group and, according to pluralists’ criteria, prefer their families’ benefits over their individual profit. Since Iran is classified as a pluralist culture, in Iran's professional organizations, such as universities and colleges, people who feel more of attachment aid to increase the efficiency. So we anticipate that the understanding of being of one's own in Iranian organizations plays a crucial role in its national and organizational cultur...|$|R
40|$|In this chapter, Lars Osberg has the {{daunting}} task of examining the conceptual {{issues involved in}} defining and measuring social progress. As he highlights in his introduction, while much had been made of the fact that Canada in 2000 earned first place in the United Nations' Human Development Index, other indices have produced much less brilliant results. Modern <b>pluralist</b> <b>societies,</b> however, have no common benchmark from which to define the "good" society. As a result, Osberg argues, "social progress" in a liberal society must be measured in the "enabling" sense that a society progresses when it enables more of its citizens to achieve the kind of life they personally value. Some of the empirical difficulties involved in constructing a measure of the attainment of social and economic rights are discussed and several quantitative indices of social progress are examined using the prism of human rights.
