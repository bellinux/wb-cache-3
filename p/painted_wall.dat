25|$|The Romans {{used its}} summit as a fortification. An urn {{containing}} coins of the Roman Emperors Trajan and Severus {{was found at}} the site before 1790. Other finds have included pennant sandstone roof tiles and <b>painted</b> <b>wall</b> plaster, indicative of a substantial building that {{is more likely to}} have been a temple than a villa. Many of the finds are in the Somerset County and Weston-super-Mare Museums, with Romano-British pottery in the Blake Museum, Bridgwater.|$|E
25|$|She {{began work}} as a {{part-time}} consultant for the Antiquities Department, guiding tourists around the Temple of Seti and explaining {{the symbolism of the}} <b>painted</b> <b>wall</b> scenes. In 1972, she suffered a mild heart attack and in the aftermath decided to sell her old house and move into a zareba (a ramshackle single room made of reeds). Ahmed Soliman, the son of the onetime keeper of the Temple of Seti, built a simple mudbrick house adjacent to his family home where Omm Sety moved and lived as part of the Soliman family. She reported in her diary that on first moving into her new home, Seti I appeared and carried out a ritual that consecrated the habitation, bowing reverently towards small statues of Osiris and Isis she kept in a small shrine-niche.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} archaeological {{features}} visible within the woods, including medieval wood banks, small quarry pits, signs of Roman industrial use and a Roman dwelling place. The first archaeological excavations {{were carried out}} by Edmund Tyrell Artis (1789–1847), the Steward of the nearby FitzWilliam estate, {{in the first half}} of the 19th century. He suggested a Roman villa site, and the presence of iron working and furnaces within the wood, and in 1965 the Peterborough Museum Society found and excavated furnaces within the woods. Little was then investigated until the 2011 series of archaeological television programme Time Team, which included a LIDAR survey and an archaeological dig within these woods. They confirmed that iron extraction from pits within the woodland, Roman iron smelting sites, and other evidence of Roman industry implied an industrial centre that was significant for Roman British iron supplies. A Roman bath-house, with surviving <b>painted</b> <b>wall</b> plaster may indicate an overseer's residence.|$|E

From 31 October 2004 until the evacuation on 5 July 2005, the freedom memorial, a newly erected white <b>painted</b> <b>wall</b> made of original wall segments and 1067 commemorative crosses for the victims of the GDR border regime stood on a leased site.

60|$|Perhaps {{the rival}} author in me {{withheld}} me, but, as a brother man, I {{will not allow}} that I did not feel for him and suffer with him because of the thick, white pigment which plentifully coated his face, and, with the sweat drops upon it, {{made me think of}} a newly <b>painted</b> <b>wall</b> in the rain. He was infinitely older than his personality, than his oldest joke (though you never can be sure how old a joke is), and, representatively, I dare say he outdated the pyramids. They must have made clowns whiten their faces in the dawn of time, and no doubt there were drolls among the antediluvians who enhanced the effect of their fun by that means. All the same, I pitied this clown for it, and I fancied in his wildest waggery the note of a real irascibility. Shall I say that he seemed the only member of that little circus who was not of an amiable temper? But I do not blame him, and I think it much to have seen a clown once more who jested audibly with the ringmaster and always got the better of him in repartee. It was long since I had known that pleasure.|$|E
60|$|And this {{is always}} to be remembered in looking at any {{engravings}} from the works of Giotto; for the injury they sustain in being deprived of their colour is far greater than {{in the case of}} later designers. All works produced in the fourteenth century agree in being more or less decorative; they were intended in most instances to be subservient to architectural effect, and were executed in the manner best calculated to produce a striking impression when they were seen in a mass. The <b>painted</b> <b>wall</b> and the painted window were part and parcel of one magnificent whole; and it is as unjust to the work of Giotto, or of any contemporary artist, to take out a single feature from the series, and represent it in black and white on a separate page, as it would be to take out a compartment of a noble coloured window, and engrave it in the same manner. What is at once refined and effective, if seen at the intended distance in unison {{with the rest of the}} work, becomes coarse and insipid when seen isolated and near; and the more skilfully the design is arranged, so as to give full value to the colours which are introduced in it, the more blank and cold will it become when it is deprived of them.|$|E

[...] Knowing that silence brings no good to kings, [...] And mocks returning victory, he passed [...] Between the pillars with a beating heart [...] And saw where {{in the midst of the}} great hall [...] Pale-faced, alone upon a bench, Edain [...] Sat upright with a sword before her feet. [...] Her hands on either side had gripped the bench, [...] Her eyes were cold and steady, her lips tight. [...] Some passion had made her stone. Hearing a foot [...] She started and then knew whose foot it was; [...] But when he thought to take her in his arms [...] She motioned him afar, and rose and spoke: [...] 'I have sent among the fields or to the woods [...] The fighting men and servants of this house, [...] For I would have your judgment upon one [...] Who is self-accused. If she be innocent [...] She would not look in any known man's face [...] Till judgment has been given, and if guilty, [...] Will never look again on known man's face.' [...] And at these words he paled, as she had paled, [...] Knowing that he should find upon her lips [...] The meaning of that monstrous day.|$|E
