Contrary to classical market segmentation, the user adaptive Web engine in this paper segments users based on cognitive and cultural dimensions. To build a Web site that changes based on what the user has clicked on, the system must be capable of figuring out what version to serve, and be able to morph between different versions of the Web site. The engine to achieve this goal has two main components: the <b>presentation</b> <b>engine,</b> and the math engine.

Lastly, 501 participants in a study conducted in Japan evaluated the prototype Web site.

Though some existing streaming technologies are able to adapt to varying bandwidths, they do not provide smooth reactions to user interactions with the continuous stream. We have developed the MPEG-L/MRP strategy, an adaptive prefetching algorithm for the MPEG- 1 video format in combination with an intelligent buering tech-nique that allows for smooth and quick reactions to user interactions with the stream. With L/MRP [12] an ap-proach already has been presented to deliver and buer homogeneous continuous data streams like Motion-JPEG with special focus on fast reaction to user interactions.

40|$|Potential patients, {{healthcare}} professionals, controllers {{and many}} others need structural information about hospitals. Examples for structural information are the number of departments, {{the number of cases}} and the areas of expertise. The CERES research project at Aachen University has developed an object-oriented metamodel to collect all relevant structural information about hospitals in an object database. The database content can be used for a variety of applications. The problem is that each of the potential user groups prefers a different structuring of the database content and a different way of presentation, eg. natural language text, tables, or data summarised to key figures. A variety of approaches has been developed to define individual views on object databases and to present their content in different ways. Unfortunately, all of them suffer from the complexity trying to develop a universal approach. As a result, the proposed mechanisms are difficult to understand and to use for domain modellers and editors working on the presentation of data. We developed an object-oriented view system combined with a presentation mechanism that is tailor-made to fit the task of presenting structural information about hospitals to multiple user groups. We allow for a simple view definition and for an easy-to-use, highly configurable <b>presentation</b> <b>engine.</b> The output is presented via the world wide web.

40|$|XML and its {{associated}} languages are emerging as powerful authoring tools for multimedia and hypermedia web content. Furthermore, intelligent <b>presentation</b> generation <b>engines</b> have begun to appear, as have models and platforms for adaptive presentations. However, XML-based models are limited by their lack of expressiveness in presentation and animation. As a result, authors of dynamic, adaptive web content must often use considerable amounts of script or code. The use of such script or code has two serious drawbacks. First, such code undermines the declarative description possible in the original presentation language, and second, the scripting/coding approach does not readily lend itself to authoring by non-programmers. In this paper we describe a set of XML language extensions, inspired by features from the functional programming world, which are designed to widen the class of reactive systems which could be described in languages such as SMIL.
