5|$|Despite initial {{skepticism}} in the West, the new Soviet leader {{proved to}} be committed to reversing the Soviet Union's deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing the arms race with the West. Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced glasnost, or openness, which increased freedom of the <b>press</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> transparency of state institutions. Glasnost was intended to reduce the corruption {{at the top of the}} Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee. Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating détente between the two nations.|$|E

5|$|Disorder {{spread across}} the {{province}} as large processions ignored section 144 and condemned {{the actions of the}} police. More than 30,000 people congregated at Curzon Hall in Dhaka. During the continued protests, police actions led to the death of four more people. This prompted officers and clerks from different organisations, including colleges, banks and the radio station, to boycott offices and join the procession. Protesters burned the offices of two leading pro-government news agencies, the Jubilee <b>Press</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Morning News. Police fired on a major janaza, or mourning rally, as it was passing through Nawabpur Road.

5|$|In 1900, Hobbs met Ada Ellen Gates, a cobbler's daughter, at {{an evening}} church service held in St Matthew's, Cambridge.

They planned to keep the event quiet, but it {{was reported in the}} <b>press</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> couple received gifts and messages from Hobbs' Surrey team-mates. Hobbs so disliked being separated from his wife during cricket tours that in later years she often accompanied the team overseas. They had four children: Jack, born in 1907, Leonard in 1909, Vera in 1913 and Ivor in 1914.|$|E

5|$|Modern Swedish (Swedish: nysvenska) {{begins with}} the advent of the {{printing}} <b>press</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> European Reformation.

The main translators were Laurentius Andreæ and the brothers Laurentius and Olaus Petri.|$|E
