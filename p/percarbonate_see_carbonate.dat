However, there is disagreement among practitioners as to which data to plot, whether using only data on one side of equivalence or on both sides, and whether to select data nearest equivalence or in the most linear portions: using the data nearest the equivalence point will enable the two x-intercepts to be more coincident with each other and to better coincide with estimates from derivative plots, while using acid-side data in an acid-base titration presumably minimizes interference from titratable (buffering) impurities, such as bicarbonate/carbonate in the base (<b>see</b> <b>Carbonate</b> content), and the effect of a drifting ionic strength.

30|$|It is {{commonly}} believed that increasing pCO 2 will induce an enhanced greenhouse effect and change seawater chemistry, resulting in future OA (Figs. 2 and 3; Table 1) (IPCC 2017). The mid-Cretaceous {{represents one of}} the warmest climate intervals during the entire Phanerozoic (termed the “hot house”) due to enhanced pCO 2 (e.g., Takashima et al. 2009). Actually, the mid-Cretaceous {{is believed to have been}} a much warmer environment with much higher pCO 2 (e.g., Berner and Kothavala 2001). The fact that we <b>see</b> relatively better <b>carbonate</b> preservation in the mid-Cretaceous suggests that the ocean surface was sufficiently basic, despite higher pCO 2, to allow the growth of calcifying producers. Alkalinity should have been supplied by chemical weathering on the land. A higher alkalinity inventory in the ocean is in fact expected according to an enhancement of the chemical weathering of silicate rocks, driven by pCO 2 and intensified hydrological cycles on the Earth’s surface (Fig. 2) (e.g., Broecker and Sanyal 1998; Cohen et al. 2004).|$|R
60|$|From the {{experiments}} tried {{in these three}} different ways, we <b>see</b> that the <b>carbonate,</b> which contains 23.7 per cent. of nitrogen, is less efficient than the nitrate, which contains 35 per cent. The phosphate contains less nitrogen than either of these salts, namely, only 21.2 per cent., and yet is far more [page 169] efficient; its power no doubt depending quite as much on the phosphorus as on the nitrogen which it contains. We may infer {{that this is the}} case, from the energetic manner in which bits of bone and phosphate of lime affect the leaves. The inflection excited by the other salts of ammonia is probably due solely to their nitrogen,--on the same principle that nitrogenous organic fluids act powerfully, whilst non-nitrogenous organic fluids are powerless. As such minute doses of the salts of ammonia affect the leaves, we may feel almost sure that Drosera absorbs and profits by the amount, though small, which is present in rain-water, {{in the same manner as}} other plants absorb these same salts by their roots.|$|R

Sarana and Kar (2011) report that the coal bands affected by intrusives suffered through a temperature up 500  °C as was indicated {{on the basis of}} the presence of unaltered pyrite. Kus (2017) states that the oxidative and thermal alteration of coal is induced by a high-temperature regime at temperatures over 800  °C. However, besides high-temperature alteration, Stukalova and Rusinova (2007) consider also low-temperature alteration: at the contact of the Early Cretaceous coal with a diabase dike (coal-intrusive contact), the high-temperature alteration of coal organic mass took place, but farther away from the dike, the coal was altered by low-temperature hydrothermal metamorphism. The coal in direct contact with the dike had properties typical of anthracites: strong anisotropy and high random vitrinite reflectance values (Rr 3.8 %– 5.5 %), unlike the low thermally altered coal at a certain distance from the dikes (Rr 2.0 %– 2.5 %). Thus, the local high-temperature transformation of the coal organic mass at the dike contacts was followed by a relatively low-temperature hydrothermal metamorphism of the coal. Altered coal often contains <b>carbonates</b> (<b>see</b> Supplementary material, point 2).|$|R

40|$|Jezero is a {{approximately}} 45 km diameter {{impact crater}} {{located in the}} Nili Fossae region of Mars. Jezero is an outstanding site to address key questions of ancient Mars climate, habitability, and volcanic history because: (a) It hosted an open-basin lake during the era of valley network formation [1, 2], which ceased at approximately the Noachian-Hesperian boundary [3]. (b) It contains two delta deposits [1, 4] with Fe/Mg-smectite and Mg-carbonate sediment [4 - 7] (the only exposure of lacus-trine shoreline <b>carbonates</b> <b>seen</b> so far on Mars). (c) The depositional environment and mineral assemblage of the delta are promising for the concentration and preservation of organic matter [5, 8]. (d) The diverse geologic units in Jezero are in clear stratigraphic context [7]. The Jezero paleolake system has been thoroughly investigated {{at a variety of}} scales, including work on: the mineralogy of the delta deposits [4 - 6] and watershed [7], as well as the morphology and sedimentology of the basin [9] and delta deposits [1, 4].

40|$|Hemipelagic {{intervals}} in four giant Calypso piston cores {{from the}} Balearic Abyssal Plain (western Mediterranean Sea) were studied {{in order to}} determine fluctuations in the supply of terrigenous sediments to the basin during the last 130, 000 years and possible climatic modulation of terrigenous sediment and particle flux. Carbonate records from hemipelagic intervals in these cores display distinct ‘Atlantic’ type cycles, where glacial periods show, on average, 20 % lower calcium carbonate contents than interglacial period equivalents. The decrease in calcium <b>carbonate</b> <b>seen</b> during glacials {{may be the result of}} increased dilution by terrigenous (aeolian and fluvial) particles derived from aeolian and/or fluvial sources. Higher glacial aeolian particle fluxes to the western Mediterranean Sea may have been caused by changes in the prevailing atmospheric conditions, resulting in drier and colder climatic conditions in the source areas and more frequent and intense outbreaks of dust transport. The colder and drier climatic conditions in combination with a lowered sea level would allow rivers to dump their sediment load closer to the shelf edge, promoting enhanced fluvial input into the basin. Besides significant calcium carbonate variations that correlate with glacial/interglacial cycles, several short-term abrupt changes in the calcium carbonate content are recorded, which appear coincident with enhanced magnetic susceptibility values, especially the events within Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3. The timing of these short-term events may be linked with cooling events in the North Atlantic, particularly Heinrich Events and cold events within MIS 5. These short-term trends may possibly be explained by increased terrigenous particle transport, due to drier and colder climate in the Mediterranean borderlands. Our results further show that about 90 % of the sedimentary sequence of the Balearic Abyssal Plain consists of turbidites. Generally, these appear not to have caused significant erosion, and an almost complete continuous time stratigraphy is present in the intercalated hemipelagic intervals...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) {{has become an}} indispensable tool in petroleum industry for formation evaluation. This dissertation addresses two problems. • We aim at developing a theory {{to better understand the}} phenomena of transverse relaxation in the presence of internal field gradients. • Chracterizing the pore structure of vuggy carbonates. We have developed a two dimensional model to study a system of claylined pore. We have identified three distinct relaxation regimes. The interplay of three time parameters characterize the transverse relaxation in three different regimes. In future work, useful geometric information can be extracted from from SEM images and the pore size distribution analysis of North Burbank sandstone to simulate transverse relaxation using our 2 -D clay flake model and study diffusional coupling in the presence of internal field gradients. Carbonates reservoirs exhibit complex pore structure with micropores and macropores/vugs. Vuggy pore space can be divided into separate-vugs and touching-vugs, depending on vug interconnection. Separate vugs are connected only through interparticle pore networks and do not contribute to permeability. Touching vugs are independent of rock fabric and form an interconnected pore system enhancing the permeability. Accurate characterization of pore structure of carbonate reservoirs is essential for design and implementation of enhanced oil recovery processes. However, characterizing pore structure in carbonates is a complex task due to the diverse variety of pore types <b>seen</b> in <b>carbonates</b> and extreme pore level heterogeneity. The carbonate samples which are focus of this study are very heterogeneous in pore structures. Some of the sample rocks are breccia and other samples are fractured. In order to characterize the pore size in vuggy carbonates, we use NMR along with tracer analysis. The distribution of porosity between micro and macro-porosity can be measured by NMR. However, NMR cannot predict if different sized vugs are connected or isolated. Tracer analysis is used to characterize the connectivity of the vug system and matrix. Modified version of differential capacitance model of Coats and Smith (1964) and a solution procedure developed by Baker (1975) is used to study dispersion and capacitance effects in core-samples. The model has three dimensionless groups: 1) flowing fraction (f), 2) dimensionless group for mass transfer (NM) characterizing the mass transfer between flowing and stagnant phase and 3) dimensionless group for dispersion (NK) characterizing the extent of dispersion. In order to obtain unique set of model parameters from experimental data, we have developed an algorithm which uses effluent concentration data at two different flow rates to obtain the fitted parameter for both cases simultaneously. Tracer analysis gives valuable insight on fraction of dead-end pores and dispersion and mass transfer effects at core scale. This can be used to model the flow of surfactant solution through vuggy and fractured carbonates to evaluate the loss of surfactant due to dynamic adsorption...|$|R

The Maokou Formation provides an extinction recordmarked {{by the loss}} of keriothecal-walled fusulinaceans and a turnover incalcareous algae. In sections within the Emeishanprovince this crisis occurs {{at the base of the}} oldest record of volcanismfrom the Jinogondolella altudaensis conodont zone (of mid-Capitanian age). Around the periphery of the Emeishan province this extinction level lies within the upper part of the Maokou Formation at a level where platform carbonate deposition was frequently interrupted by thick volcanic ash depositional events. The assemblages of the uppermost Maokou Formation are characterised by typical “Late Permian” taxa although these levels still lie within theMiddle Permian (Guadalupian Series). “Disaster” taxa, such as Earlandia and Diplosphaerina are locally prolifically abundant in the aftermath of the mass extinction. The crisis is particularly noteworthy amongst photosynthetic taxa such as calcareous algae and fusulinaceans that probably harboured photosymbionts. Therefore, a kill mechanism involving cooling from explosive volcanism and potentially acid rain from sulphate aerosols appears appropriate. A composite δ 13 C carb curve, calibrated against a high-resolution conodont biostratigraphy reveals a major intra-Capitanian negative excursion (of > 5 ‰) superimposed on typically heavy (4 – 5 ‰) Middle Permian values. This curve can also be recognised in Panthalassan seamount carbonates of Japan although this requires reassignment of apparently Upper Permian limestones to the Middle Permian. In both China and Japan the Capitanian mass extinction occurs during the early stage of this major, intra-Capitanian negative excursion. Assuming typical platform carbonate accumulation rates, the records of the Maokou Formation suggest δ 13 C carb values fell at 0. 01 ‰/kyr suggesting a catastrophic origin (such as gas hydrate destabilisation) is unlikely, although a volcanic source is possible...|$|R
