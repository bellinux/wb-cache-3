50|$|Several {{methods were}} {{applied in the}} {{preparation}} of locusts, prior to eating them. One of the more popular ways was to take the locusts after gathering them and to throw them into a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> boiling <b>salt</b> <b>water.</b> After cooking for a few minutes, they were then removed from the pot and placed within a heated oven in order to dry them, or else spread out in the sun to dry. Once dry, they would take up the locusts and break off their heads, wings and legs and discard them, eating only the thorax and abdomen. Another method was to stoke an earthenware stove and, when fully heated, to cast them while alive into the cavity of the stove. Once roasted, they were taken out and a brine solution was sprinkled over them, before spreading them out in the sun to dry, usually upon one’s rooftop.|$|R
40|$|Imagine yourself, a few friends, {{and family}} at the beach. The weather is amazingly {{cooperative}} {{this time of year}} for Southeast Alaska, and you feel blessed to enjoy the sunshine. Even though the wind cools the temperature, the beauty of the Alaska landscape is cause enough for celebration. What a day this is! The ocean and the scenery are magnificent. A seafood feast planned for mid-afternoon has members of your party busy harvesting shellfish from the rocky beach. In less time than expected, buckets of harvested shellfish arrive {{at the feet of the}} chef. A steamer <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> boiling <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> quickly cooks the bounty, and a few minutes later the harvest is devoured with gusto. What qualities could better represent a day in the Great Land? Reluctant to disrupt the excitement of the outing, George tells you that he feels a strange tingling on his lips and face. Your spouse is also experiencing the same strange numbness on her face. You, too busy to eat much, don’t understand as each guest complains of this strange ailment. Your spouse stumbles as she carries more food to the table. George becomes dizzy and nauseous. While helping him to a beach chair, you notice the volleyball team is leaving the playing area as each person becomes listless. The game is over, and unfortunately, so is the party. What is happening to these people? Could seafood fresh from the ocean cause such a serious condition? The problem is paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), and there is little you can do at this point except to get these victims to a medical facility and fast. A potentially lethal event, PSP is a crisis no one wants to experience. As many coastal residents know, eating personally harvested shellfish is risky. As Alaskans you need to know about PSP, what health dangers it presents, and how you can reduce your risk of contracting this dreaded ailment...|$|R
5000|$|Raw {{peanuts and}} green peanuts are {{generally}} used for boiled peanuts. A green peanut {{is a term}} to describe farm fresh harvested peanuts {{that have not been}} dehydrated. They are available from grocery stores, food distributors and farmers markets, during the growing season. [...] "Raw" [...] peanuts are also uncooked but have been dried/dehydrated and must be rehydrated before boiling (usually in a bowl full of water overnight). Once rehydrated, the raw peanuts are ready to be boiled. Raw peanuts in the shell are put in a large <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> very heavily <b>salted</b> <b>water</b> and boiled. This can be done inside on the stove or outside on a propane burner or fire pit for a larger volume. Depending on the locality, some cooks use rock salt or standard table salt, or both. The boil can go on from four to seven hours or more, depending on quantity and the age of the peanut (green peanuts cook faster and tend to be better tasting), and the boilings will most often be of several gallons of water. Flavorings such as ham hocks, hot sauce, Cajun seasonings or beer can be added to the boil. An alternative method for dried raw mature peanuts is to re-hydrate them by soaking overnight in water, after which they can be cooked in the conventional manner.|$|R

40|$|Underwater welding using {{shielded}} {{metal arc welding}} (SMAW) on US naval Vessels is very attractive because {{of the ability to}} effect repairs without costly dry dock expenses. In the past the primary problems with underwater wet weldments on steels utilizing SMAW with ferritic electrodes, were underbead cracking in the heat affected zone (HAZ), slag inclusions, oxide inclusions, and porosity. To avoid underbead cracking three weld samples were made using an austenitic nickel weld metal with an Oxylance coating at 10 feet <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> <b>water,</b> 25 feet <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> <b>water,</b> and 33 feet <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> <b>water.</b> A final sample was made using austenitic nickel weld metal with a Broco coating at 33 feet <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> <b>water.</b> Because <b>of</b> the ductility of the austenitic nickel weld metal no underbead cracking occurred, however porosity and high inclusion counts were found in all four samples. The average size of the inclusion increased with increasing depth. The Broco sample exhibited far greater porosity than did the 0 xylance samples. This work addresses quality of the welds, mechanisms for the formation of the inclusions, and analysis of the difference between the Oxylance and Broco weld rods[URL]...|$|R
