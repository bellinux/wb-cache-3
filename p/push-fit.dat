5000|$|Wavin's own Technology and Innovation Centre (Wavin T&I), employs {{more than}} 50 people {{to develop new}} {{products}} and systems with local Wavin companies. Products for the European market include the [...] "smartFIX" [...] <b>push-fit</b> fitting, the Tempower surface heating and cooling product, Tegra manholes and inspection chambers and the SiTech low noise in-house soil and waste system.|$|E
50|$|Around 1955 Hozelock Ltd in the United Kingdom invented and {{patented}} {{the international}} standard plastic, click-on style, <b>push-fit</b> hose end connector now used with garden hoses. The concept {{was developed to}} replace metal hose end connectors in coal mines, which were prone to cause static sparks {{and the possibility of}} methane gas explosions. The system is now universally used by gardeners throughout the world.|$|E
50|$|Bayonet {{electrical}} connectors {{are used}} in the same applications where other connectors are used, to transmit either power or signals. Bayonet connections can be made faster than screw connections, and more securely than <b>push-fit</b> connections; they are more resistant to vibration than both these types. They may be used to connect two cables, or to connect a cable to a connector on the panel of a piece of equipment.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in the 2000s, {{a number}} of {{companies}} introduced products to address these issues. In these systems, the junction box was sealed and two wires were permanently attached to it using strain reliefs. The cables ended with <b>push-fit</b> connectors that met the definition of a [...] "convenience receptacle", meaning they could be (legally) connected together by anyone. Two connectors became somewhat common during this period, the Radox connector and MC3 connector, both of which essentially looked like weather sealed phono jacks.|$|E
50|$|Push-to-pull, push-to-connect, push-in, <b>push-fit,</b> or instant {{fittings}} are {{a type of}} easily removed {{compression fitting}} or quick connect fitting that allows an air (or water) line to be attached, nominally {{without the use of}} tools (a tool is still usually required for cutting tubing to length and removal). These fittings act similar to the way regular compression fittings work, but use a resilient O-ring for sealing, and a grip ring to hold the (possibly grooved) tube in place. With metal tubing, a groove is needed to hold the tube in place. With PTFE tubing, the tube deforms around the grip ring.|$|E
50|$|Many {{other methods}} {{can be used}} to attach hoses or tubing, such as {{compression}} fittings (where a nylon or soft metal ferrule is compressed onto the hose by the tightening of the fitting), <b>push-fit</b> fittings (where the hose is inserted inside of a compression sleeve, designed such that force against the hose causes the sleeve to tighten), swage fittings (where a stiff collar is compressed onto the hose), clamp fittings (where two blocks are tightened onto the sides of the hose, often found on garden hoses), crimp banding (similar to worm gear banding but a crimp is used instead of a screw/thread), and a multitude of others. However, these devices are not typically referred to as hose clamps.|$|E
5000|$|Grease {{fittings}} are {{permanently installed}} by either a (taper) thread or straight <b>push-fit</b> ('hammer in') arrangement, leaving a nipple connection that a grease gun attaches to. The pressure {{supplied by the}} grease gun forces a small captive bearing ball in the fitting to move back against the force of its retaining spring. The arrangement is thus essentially a valve that opens under pressure to allow lubricant to pass through a channel and be forced into the voids of the bearing. When the pressure ceases, the ball returns to its closed position. The ball excludes dirt and functions as a check valve to prevent grease escaping {{back out of the}} fitting. The ball is almost flush with the surface of the fitting {{so that it can be}} wiped clean to reduce the amount of debris carried with the grease into the bearing.|$|E
40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} offers {{exciting new}} possibilities for improving long-term metallic implant fixation in bone through enabling open porous structures for bony ingrowth. The {{aim of this}} research was to investigate how the technology could also improve initial fixation, a precursor to successful long-term fixation. A new barbed fixation mechanism, relying on flexible struts was proposed and manufactured as a <b>push-fit</b> peg. The technology was optimized using a synthetic bone model and compared with conventional press-fit peg controls tested over a range of interference fits. Optimum designs, achieving maximum pull-out force, were subsequently tested in a cadaveric femoral condyle model. The barbed fixation surface provided more than double the pull-out force for {{less than a third of}} the insertion force compared to the best performing conventional press-fit peg (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Indeed, it provided screw-strength pull out from a <b>push-fit</b> device (1, 124 [*]Â±[*] 146 [*]N). This step change in implant fixation potential offers new capabilities for low profile, minimally invasive implant design, while providing new options to simplify surgery, allowing for one-piece <b>push-fit</b> components with high levels of initial stability...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the suitability of packaging aspirin tablets in one thousand tablet packs that require reclosure after dispensing each dose. The reclosure efficiency of the <b>push-fit</b> type closure of a plastic container in preventing moisture entry was determined and compared to a control container. Aspirin tablets used in this study were shown to be susceptible to moisture degradation leading to significant losses of potency (p 0. 05). It can, therefore, be concluded that the proper use of <b>push-fit</b> closures on containers for packaging aspirin tablets provides effective protection and the use of more expensive single unit strip packaging, for example, is therefore not necessary...|$|E
40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) {{laminates}} have no {{moving parts}} and last 25 {{years or more}} with no maintenance aside from the occasional cleaning. Historically PV systems have been `hard-wired' between junction boxes. The use of photovoltaics in buildings has necessitated the use of `push-fit' connectors to enable quick and easy connection between modules on roofs and facades. The PV industry is largely unaware however, {{of the potential for}} inter-module connector failure from the use of such <b>push-fit</b> connectors. An inclined roof is used to study the behavior of individual electrical contact resistances within a new type of PV shingle. The possible modes of connector failure in such a system are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasound, closed-circuit {{television}} (CCTV) and Panoramo (R) {{are capable of}} inspecting drinking water pipes and joints of any pipe material. The three tools were tested for their accuracy and reproducibility for gap width sizing in double-socket <b>push-fit</b> joints. The tests were performed at laboratory scale (PVC pipes and joints) in the field (asbestos cement pipes and joints) and in three full-scale tests (PVC) inside pipes used to supply drinking water. In the laboratory tests both accuracy and reproducibility were evaluated. In the field and full-scale tests only reproducibility of the tools was tested. CCTV {{proved to be the}} most accurate and reproducible for the application. This straightforward approach {{is considered to be a}} surrogate measure for joint's condition...|$|E
40|$|EP 1591780 A UPAB: 20051130 NOVELTY - An {{electrochemical}} sensor identifies the contents in liquids. The sensor has an upper section with a fluid inlet (7) and {{is brought into}} contact with a thin-film electrode (2) embedded {{on the surface of}} a chip (1). When the cover is closed the thin-film electrode is brought into <b>push-fit</b> contact with a mechanical electrical contact (5). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - In a further embodiment the fluid sample inlet tube discharges to the thin-film electrode via a void with a surrounding seal (9). In this mode the sensor also operates as a detector. USE - Electro-chemical sensor for the identification of substances in liquids. ADVANTAGE - The sensor chip is much cheaper to manufacture than prior art. Further claimed is that the sensor is rapidly replaced or interchanged by mechanical connector...|$|E
40|$|The Index of Joint Condition (IJC) for {{polyvinyl}} chloride (PVC) <b>push-fit</b> joints, {{discussed in this}} article, was derived from installation guidelines and from destructive laboratory tests. The IJC is presented in a graphical framework and is a powerful tool to employ in order to visualize and compare, in situ, results obtained during condition assessment of PVC joints. The graphical results can also be translated into a numerical grade that allows comparing the conditions of various pipes and of individual joints. The applicability of the IJC is demonstrated in the condition assessment of 222 joints inspected in eight different sessions that encapsulate more than 2 km of older (more than 40 years) and newer pipes (less than 2 months). While, for the new pipe, all joints {{were considered to be}} in good condition -low replacement priority -, several joints in older pipes were considered to have high replacement priority...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} in mechanical separation is the feeding of the sample. The most desirable feeder should be continuously variable, and capable of providing very fast or very slow feeds. Those used here, both for the isodynamic separator and the mica separator, are essentially similar to those described by Faul and Davis (1959), with the difference that they are made from brass and have exchangeable plugs with dif-ferent sizes of orifice (fig. 1). They are made from 1 in. diam. thin-walled brass tube, with a <b>push-fit</b> plug that has a shallow polished conical base. in. diam. holes were used for general purposes; smaller or larger holes may better suit particular problems. The feeders are attached to 6 -volt or 24 -volt relays, controlled by small variable potentiometers. Faul (personal communication) suggests the use of aluminium hoppers and there is probably little difference between the two. When feeding fine material below 200 mesh, {{the presence of a}} 1 ~ in. brass rod bevelled at 60 ~ as shown, to fit the cone {{at the base of the}} feeder, results in a fine feed of material and prevents clumping or stoppage. Such a device allows the separator to be run for many hours without attention, and material of 350 to 400 mesh has been handled satisfactorily...|$|E
