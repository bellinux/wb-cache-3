5|$|For {{internal}} broaching {{the sides of}} the broach are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for external broaching the sides are drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the broach from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the work piece rotates, the broach is <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> it, is driven by it, and rotates synchronously with it. If the tool holder rotates, the broach is <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> the workpiece, but is driven by the tool holder.|$|E

50|$|The thermal grill {{illusion}} is a sensory illusion originally {{demonstrated in}} 1896 by the Swedish physician Torsten Thunberg. The illusion {{is created by}} an interlaced grill of warm (e.g., 40°C/104°F) and cool (20°C/68°F) bars. When someone <b>presses</b> a hand <b>against</b> the grill, he or she experiences the illusion of burning heat. But if the person <b>presses</b> <b>against</b> only a cool bar, only coolness is experienced; if the person <b>presses</b> <b>against</b> only a warm bar, only warmth is experienced.|$|R

5|$|The club's {{supporters}} {{have been involved}} in two major tragedies. The first was the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, where escaping fans were <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> a collapsing wall in the Heysel Stadium, with 39 people—mostly Italians and Juventus fans—dying, after which English clubs were given a five-year ban from European competition. The second was the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, where 96 Liverpool supporters died in a crush against perimeter fencing.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{is similar}} in shape to that of M.mystacinus and M.brandtii, but the front part of the braincase is higher. The second and third upper premolars (P2 and P3) are tiny and <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> the upper canine (C1) and fourth premolar (P4). The canine is less {{well-developed}} than in M.mystacinus. There is a clear cusp present {{on the side of}} the P4. The accessory cusp known as the protoconule is present on each of the upper molars when they are unworn. M.mystacinus lacks the P4 cusp and the protoconules on the molars, but M.brandtii has an even larger cusp on P4.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocus had an {{extremely}} long tail, composed of about 80 caudal vertebrae, which are {{almost double the}} number some of the earlier sauropods had in their tails (such as Shunosaurus with 43), and far more than contemporaneous macronarians had (such as Camarasaurus with 53). Some speculation exists {{as to whether it}} may have had a defensive or noisemaking (by cracking it like a coachwhip) function. The tail may have served as a counterbalance for the neck. The middle part of the tail had 'double beams' (oddly shaped chevron bones on the underside, which gave Diplodocus its name). They may have provided support for the vertebrae, or perhaps prevented the blood vessels from being crushed if the animal's heavy tail <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> the ground. These 'double beams' are also seen in some related dinosaurs.|$|E
5000|$|These {{headaches}} can {{be brought}} on by such innocuous sources as wearing a halter top (<b>presses</b> <b>against</b> the neck), earplugs (<b>presses</b> <b>against</b> the jaw and inner ear), or wearing even a tiny hair clip (compresses the scalp). There is no known preventative treatment except to avoid the offending trigger. However, once symptoms arise and the trigger is removed, [...] "Triptan"-type migraine treatment is effective.|$|R

5|$|The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers on {{the upper}} lips) reach {{the tips of the}} ears when <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> the head. The short, rounded ears {{themselves}} are naked on the inside, but covered with short brown hairs on the outer surface. Females have three pairs of mammae. The digits and metapodials are mostly covered by white hairs. Short ungual tufts of hairs surrounding the bases of the claws are present. There are five pads on the forefeet and six on the hindfeet. On the hindfeet, the fifth digit is nearly as long as the middle three and the first (the hallux) is much shorter. The tail is longer than the head and body and appears naked for most of its length, but fine hairs are visible near the tip. Although the lower side is slightly lighter, there is no clear difference in coloration between the upper and lower sides. The skin of the tail is gray, and it is covered lightly by fine hairs that are dark brown over most of the length of the tail, but white near the tip.|$|E
5|$|While Foy walked {{behind his}} front line units, a {{shrapnel}} shell burst over his head, driving a bullet into his left shoulder. His wounding disheartened his soldiers, who began falling back. At {{about the same}} time, Brisbane's brigade was replaced in the front line by two brigades of Clinton's 6th Division. These fresh troops fired a volley from close range and advanced with the bayonet, driving the French down the ridge's rear slope. Pierre André Hercule Berlier's brigade of Foy's division, which was closer to Orthez, fell back after Fririon's retreat exposed its flank. With Berlier gone, Harispe's two battalions in Orthez were compelled to retreat {{in order to avoid}} capture. On the left spur, Picton's two brigades under Keane and Power <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> Darmagnac's division. After Foy's division gave way, Darmagnac retreated to the next ridge in the rear, where his troops took position on the right of Villatte's division. The divisional batteries of Picton and Clinton zeroed in on the new French position.|$|E
5|$|Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick {{their ears}} whilst sniffing. Playful {{individuals}} will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, {{and raise their}} tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails {{back and forth with}} their ears pointing backwards and <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways. During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.|$|E

5|$|Many frogs {{are able}} to absorb water and oxygen {{directly}} through the skin, especially around the pelvic area, but the permeability of a frog's skin can also result in water loss. Glands located all over the body exude mucus which helps keep the skin moist and reduces evaporation. Some glands on the hands and chest of males are specialized to produce sticky secretions to aid in amplexus. Similar glands in tree frogs produce a glue-like substance on the adhesive discs of the feet. Some arboreal frogs reduce water loss by having a waterproof layer of skin, and several South American species coat their skin with a waxy secretion. Others frogs have adopted behaviours to conserve water, including becoming nocturnal and resting in a water-conserving position. Some frogs may also rest in large groups with each frog <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> its neighbours. This reduces the amount of skin exposed to the air or a dry surface, and thus reduces water loss. Woodhouse's toad (Bufo woodhousii), if given access to water after confinement in a dry location, sits in the shallows to rehydrate. The male hairy frog (Trichobatrachus robustus) has dermal papillae projecting from its lower back and thighs, giving it a bristly appearance. They contain blood vessels and are thought to increase {{the area of the}} skin available for respiration.|$|E
5|$|Mating is {{initiated}} when {{up to five}} males follow closely {{behind a}} female and bite at her fins and body, possibly cued by pheromones indicating the female's readiness. Each male attempts to seize the female by engulfing one of her pectoral fins; at times two males might grasp a female on both sides simultaneously. Once engaged, the sharks sink to the bottom, whereupon the male (or males) rotates one of his claspers forward, inflates the associated siphon sac (a subcutaneous abdominal organ that takes in seawater {{that is used to}} flush sperm into the female), and attempts to make contact with the female's vent. In many cases, the female resists by pressing her belly against the bottom and arching her tail; this may reflect mate choice on her part. The male has a limited time in which to achieve copulation, as while he is holding the female's pectoral fin in his mouth he is being deprived of oxygen. On the other hand, if the female is willing, the pair settles side-by-side with their heads <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> the bottom and their bodies at an upward angle.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouthpiece}} {{and reed}} {{are surrounded by}} the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on the reed and form an airtight seal. Air is blown past the reed and down the instrument. In {{the same way a}} flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past the reed causes it to vibrate. As air pressure from the mouth increases, the amount the reed vibrates increases until the reed hits the mouthpiece. At this point the reed stays <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> the mouthpiece until either the springiness of the reed forces it to open or a returning pressure wave 'bumps' into the reed and opens it. Each time the reed opens, a puff of air goes through the gap, after which the reed swings shut again. When played loudly, the reed can spend up to 50% of the time shut. The 'puff of air' or compression wave (around 3% greater pressure than the surrounding air) travels down the cylindrical tube and escapes {{at the point where the}} tube opens out. This is either at the closest open hole or at the end of the tube (see diagram: image 1).|$|E

50|$|Certain {{manufacturers}} have {{created their own}} unique attempts to create the ideal capo. One {{of the more popular}} and well recognized capos is the Shubb capo. The Shubb capo is applied by holding the capo in its desired location, and closing a lever to secure the capo. The unique aspect of this capo is that the lever <b>presses</b> <b>against</b> a second arm that <b>presses</b> <b>against</b> {{the back of the neck}} of the instrument. The amount of pressure the lever exerts is adjustable by a screw so that the capo can exert the minimal amount of pressure required to hold down the strings.|$|R
