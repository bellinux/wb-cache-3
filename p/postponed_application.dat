In order to build the R-matrix we exploit the twisting method for introducing new parameters as well as for making the transition to the reductive case. The physical motivation behind this construction is in the theory of integrable models: we intend to use such R-matrix for building the associated quantum R-matrix and Lax operators with spectral as well as color parameters - the color parameters being provided by the eigenvalues of the central generators of the reductive Lie algebra in a given representation.

40|$|Proceedings Paper (for Acquisition Research Program) Modern {{military}} systems increasingly rely on {{the integration}} of multiple advanced technologies. While these technologies vastly increase warfighter capabilities, they also introduce risk into the system design and development process that tends to increase both its cost and duration. As acquisition cycle-times increase, warfighters must make do with dated technology for longer periods. Thus, there is an incentive to push as many advanced technologies as possible into each program to maximize warfighter capability over the next acquisition cycle. Unfortunately, the more new technologies a system has, the more risky its acquisition becomes, and consequently, its duration and cost increase even further. Thus, there is a feedback effect that exacerbates the problem. Open-architecture designs can partially alleviate this problem, but some technology decisions are so integral to a system''s design that they cannot be relegated to future upgrades. Consequently, there is a tradeoff between incorporating these technologies now and increasing program risk or developing and evaluating them further but potentially <b>postponing</b> their <b>application</b> to future acquisition cycles. Our paper will examine this tradeoff by considering a new technology''s contribution to program risk. Acquisition Research Progra...|$|R

Experiments were conducted to determine N, P, and K leaching in sandy soils with 3 - 6 % clay in surface layers under maize production, {{and the effectiveness of}} different N, P, and K fertiliser timing and splitting strategies on leaching of N, P, and K and on maize yield. In a column experiment on an Oxic Paleustult (Korat series) with 3 % clay, leaching of N, P, and K from fertiliser (114 N- 17 P- 22 K in kg ha- 1) was significant under simulated rainfall, but decreased to negligible levels with 3 - 5 split applications of fertiliser. Maize N and K uptake increased with 3 - 5 split applications, but not P uptake. Despite continued intense rainfall and further fertilizer additions, leaching was not recorded after day 30, and this was attributed to the effect of plant water uptake on reducing deep drainage. Split applications of fertilizer maintained NP and K in the 0 - 30 cm layer during 30 - 60 days when maize nutrient demand was likely to be at its highest, while in the recommended fertilizer regime NPK in the surface layers declined after 30 days. In a field experiment on an Oxic Paleustult (Korat series) with 6 % clay, 3 - 4 splits of fertiliser increased N and K uptake and increased maize yields from 3. 3 to 4. 5 Mg ha- 1. <b>Postponing</b> basal fertiliser <b>application</b> from pre-planting to 7 - 15 days after emergence increased uptake of N, P, and K and grain yield emphasising the greater risk of nutrient losses from fertiliser applied at planting than later.

However, only 72 out of the 148 commenced on a gluten-free diet for up to six weeks and completed the study; clinical symptoms were recorded biweekly using a standard visual analogue scale (VAS). In the second stage after six weeks, patients whose symptoms improved to an acceptable level were randomly divided into two groups; patients either received packages containing powdered gluten (35 cases) or patients received placebo (gluten free powder) (37 cases).

The results were as follows. When the Topdressing {{fertilizer}} N (TN) was postponed from tilling stage to jointing stage, the biomass and the SPAD value in flag leaf reduced, respectively. And grain yield, protein content in grain and stability time of paste, reduced as a result. When the topdressing fertilizer N was postponed from jointing stage to booting stage, the regularity of above index changed conversely. For the treatments with the same topdressing fertilizer date (jointing stage), the appropriate ratio of Basal dressing fertilizer (BN) to topdressing fertilizer was 3 : 7, with high biomass, high SPAD value in flag leaf, high grain yield and high process quality as a result.

40|$|This paper re-defines two {{hypothetical}} laws {{of capital}} accumulation by including endogenous profit investment share and establishing an explicit inverse relation between this share and capital-output ra-tio. Other main state variables are labour productivity, employment ratio and unit value of labour force. A comprehensive Phillips equation, governing real labour compensation, {{is an element}} of a hypotheti-cal law (HL-IR). A control law (CL-IR) determines a growth rate of surplus value by a gap between target and current employment ratios. A capital strive to higher profitability alters HL-IR and CL-IR. After the recent neo-conservative defeat there is, likely, no place for stabilising policy with the same or similar aggressiveness as in 2002 – 2007.

Without any doubt, teratogenic potential was proved to be the highest in the 1 st pregnancy trimester, especially during treatment by polychemotherapy, in range of 10 % to 16 %, 3 % of which goes to large anomalies which attack fetus. The effects related to fetus depend on pregnancy stage, dose quantity and synergism with other medications, as well as on individual reactions to the medication.

In the 2 nd and 3 rd trimester the application of these medications can be the reason of setback in the development in utero, premature birth and neurotoxicity.

Ottoman forces led by Rexhep Pasha were defeated by the rebels in the field of Mavrova. The rebels in the Sanjak of Dibër were led from Sheh Mustafa Zerqani, a Bektashi priest. In a meeting in November 1844 they declared that the old autonomy of Dibër was not to be changed. The rebel army led by Cen Leka tried to stop the advancing Ottoman army led by Hayredin Pasha. The Ottoman commander declared again an amnesty, the abolishment of the new taxes and the postponement of the recruitment process which would become voluntary in the future. The greatest resistance happened during the Battle of Gjuricë, which lasted for five days.

U radu se isključivo obrađuju pitanja međunarodnog prava mora, usporedbom pravila Zakonika o međunarodnopravnim režimima uz naše obale s Konvencijom Ujedinjenih naroda o pravu mora (1982.). Pri tome se posebna pažnja posvećuje režimu vanjskog pojasa, koji Hrvatska iz nepoznatih razloga nije proglasila, kao i režimu isključivog gospodarskog pojasa. Taj pojas Hrvatska nije uspostavila s punim njegovima sadržajem, što izaziva kritike hrvatske javnosti kao i odgađanje primjene toga novog režima s obzirom na države članice Europske unije.

After many years of debates at various levels, on 3 October 2003 the Croatian Parliament adopted the Decision on the Extension of the Jurisdiction of the Republic of Croatia in the Adriatic Sea. However, the Decision did not proclaim the entire contents of the international regime of the exclusive economic zone, but only part of its contents as elaborated in Part V of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. By guaranteeing the rights of all states in accordance with the Convention, the Croatian Parliament proclaimed “the content of the exclusive economic zone related to the sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the living resources beyond the outer limits of the territorial sea, as well as the jurisdiction with regard to marine scientific research and the protection and preservation of the marine environment, whereby the ecological and fisheries protection zone of the Republic of Croatia is established as of today”. This text deserves two main comments: first, to the contents of the sovereign rights and jurisdiction expressly proclaimed by the 2003 Decision, the rights Croatia exercises over its continental shelf, which at the same time is the seabed and subsoil of the newly proclaimed ecological and fisheries protection zone, are automatically added. Second, the implementation of the new legal regime, proclaimed in October 2003, had to commence a year later, i. e. on 2 October 2004. In accordance with this provision, the 2003 Decision became effective in October 2004 in respect of all states, except the Member States of the European Union. Due to the negative reactions from Italy and Slovenia, the Croatian Parliament decided in 2004 to <b>postpone</b> the <b>application</b> of the 2003 Decision in respect of the Member States of the European Union, until the conclusion of an agreement concerning partnership in fisheries between the European Community and the Republic of Croatia. Notwithstanding this exception, neither the European Union nor its two Adriatic members have demonstrated a clear desire to resolve the problems of fisheries and other problems related to the Adriatic Sea with Croatia. Therefore, on 15 December 2006 the Croatian Parliament decided – notwithstanding the willingness of Croatia to continue cooperation in respect of all problems of the Adriatic with the European Union – to commence the application of the 2003 Decision establishing its ecological and fisheries protection zone to ships flying the flags of the Member States of the European Community on 1 January 2008 at the latest...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: A {{mathematical}} model {{is used to}} help determine the manufacturing capacity needed to support post-vehicle-application remanufacturing, repurposing, and recycling of lithium-ion batteries over time.   Simulation is used in solving the model to estimate capacity in kWh.   Lithium-ion batteries that are commonly used in the electrification of vehicles cannot be simply discarded post-vehicle-application due to the materials {{of which they are}} composed.   Eventually, each will fail to hold a charge and will need to be recycled.   Remanufacturing, allowing a battery to return to a vehicle application, and repurposing, transforming a battery for use in a non-vehicle <b>application,</b> <b>postpone</b> recycling and increase value. The {{mathematical model}} and its solution using simulation test the hypothesis that the capacity needed for remanufacturing, repurposing, and recycling as well as new battery production is a function of a single parameter:  the percent of post-vehicle-application batteries that are remanufactured. Design/methodology/approach: Equations in the mathematical model represent the capacity needed for remanufacturing, repurposing, and recycling as well as new battery production as dependent variables.   Independent variables are exogenous quantities as such as the demand for electrified vehicles of all types, physical properties of batteries such as their application life distribution including the time to recycling, and a single decision variable:  the percent of post-vehicle-application batteries that are remanufactured.   Values of the dependent variables over time are estimated by simulation for values of the percent of post-vehicle-application batteries ranging from 0 % to 85 % in steps of 5 %. Findings and Originality/value: The simulation results support important insights for investment in capacity for remanufacturing, repurposing, and recycling of post-vehicle-application batteries as well as new batteries.   The capacity needed for recycling is relatively constant regardless of the percent of post-vehicle-application batteries that are remanufactured.   The sum of the capacity for remanufacturing and recycling is relatively constant as well.   The need for new battery production capacity is reduced significantly (> 10 %) for remanufacturing percentages of 55 % and above.

Practical implications: Electrification of vehicles appears to be the only technically feasible approach to meeting government regulations concerning mileage and emissions (Center for Climate and Energy Solutions 2013).   The planning in the present for the remanufacturing, repurposing, and recycling of the lithium-ion batteries used in electrification of vehicles is necessary.   Capacity estimation is one important component of such planning.
