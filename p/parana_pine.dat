50|$|The world's {{blockades}} had {{a severe}} impact on patterns {{of world trade}} as a whole. On the outbreak of war, many South American countries expected to make big profits supplying the belligerents as in World War I. Nearly all of Bolivia's copper, lead, tin and silver was exported to Europe, while Uruguay and southern Brazil supplied wool and canned and frozen beef. Argentina had 84% of the world supply of flaxseed, nearly all of which was exported, along with much of its wheat (23% of world supply), its corn (71%) and beef (50%). But with the stalemate of blockade and counter-blockade, total foreign trade actually plummeted and large surpluses piled up. In early February 1941 the main exporting Plata nations (Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia) held a conference in Montevideo to discuss ways of improving trade between themselves {{and the rest of}} the continent. Apart from some <b>Parana</b> <b>pine,</b> tea and cereals, there was very little inter-Plata trade, and delegates eventually agreed a number of measures, such as easier currency exchange rules, finance for poorer nations, improved transport links between countries - particularly those landlocked - and lower customs barriers in order to demonstrate that they were not entirely reliant on overseas trade and American dollars to survive.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the value of}} Landsat data for mapping stands of <b>Parana</b> <b>Pine</b> (Araucaria angustifolia (Bert.) 0. Ktze) in the natural forests of southern Parana State, Brazil. This species is economically the most important forest tree in southern Brazil and estimation of its reserves {{and the rate of}} exploitation are important. Two forest areas were selected for detailed studies. For one area (Quedas do Iguacu) Landsat data in both computer compatible tape (CCT) and transparency format was used. No aerial photographs were available but an existing forest map was used as ground truth. For the second area (Mangueirinha) Landsat CCTs and aerial photographs were available. From the latter a forest cover type map was produced and used as ground truth. Additionally some field checking was undertaken. For the Quedas do Iguacu area visual qualitative temporal analyses were carried out on the products generated from transparencies of six different Landsat scenes. On these <b>Parana</b> <b>Pine</b> stands could be recognized in the MSS bands 6 and 7 and in colour composites generated from the MSS bands 4, 5 and 7. For a selected subarea a supervised computer classification using CCT data was tested success-fully for mapping both mature <b>Parana</b> <b>Pine</b> stands and reforestation areas. A supervised classification using transparencies of MSS bands 5 and 7 that were scanned and digitized by microdensitometer successfully mapped <b>Parana</b> <b>Pine</b> stands but failed to discriminate reforestation areas. For the Mangueirinha area CCTs of Landsat imagery acquired in spring and in winter were used for mapping <b>Parana</b> <b>Pine</b> stands. Both visual and computer classification methods were employed. For the latter, a small area of <b>Parana</b> <b>Pine</b> stands with two different crown densities (as ascertained from study of aerial photographs) was selected. Different combinations of MSS bands were tested using supervised and unsupervised classifications. The results showed that using a supervised classification combinations of MSS bands 5 and 7 were most effective, but that only dense stands of <b>Parana</b> <b>Pine</b> could be mapped accurately.

The objective of this work was to verify probable phytotoxics effects of some naturals and synthetics substances potentially repellentes to wild fauna, in Araucaria angustifolia seeds in vitro. The experiment was realized at Phytopatology and Plant Physiology Laboratory of Center of Agroveterinary Sciences, University of Santa Catarina State Brazil, from june to december, 2004. The <b>Paraná</b> <b>pine</b> seeds, after preparation and treatment with vegetal and not vegetal substances, were sown in plastic trays with vermiculite substratum and put on cabin of growth with controlled temperature, relative humidity of air, humidity of substratum and photoperiods. It was adopted the randomized complete design with 15 treatments, with 10 seeds each treatment and with 4 repetitions. The tested substances separately or in mixtures were: extract of fruit of red pepper, root of parsley, stem and leaf of wormwood herb, lemon scented gum essential oil, linseed oil, castor bean oil, rosin, copper oxychloride, copper sulphate, sulphur and látex ink. The root emission, stem emission, length of main root and length of stem were evaluated 76 days after sowing and statisticaly analyzed. The analysis make possible to conclude that the tested extract do not have phytotoxic effect on seeds and that the substances tested in vitro can be used in field experiments, in repellence traits for <b>Parana</b> <b>pine</b> seeds consuming fauna.
