However, Shigeru Miyamoto, a Nintendo executive, demanded the team to recreate the game as a Star Fox title for Nintendo's new console, the GameCube. Unlike previous Star Fox games, Star Fox Adventures focused on ground-based open world exploration. The game received positive reviews upon its launch in 2002. Star Fox Adventures was the only game developed by Rare for GameCube.|$|E
5|$|Optimus awakens to {{find that}} three weeks have passed, {{and in that time}} Cybertron has been reformatted into a {{primordial}} state, Megatron is missing while the Decepticons that formed the Deceptigod have been fitted with explosive microchips to keep them under control, and many unaligned Cybertronians (referred to as NAILs and led by former Autobot Metalhawk) have returned and are demanding the exile of both the Autobots and Decepticons so that they can have the <b>planet</b> <b>for</b> themselves. With the Matrix now emptied of all its power, Optimus decides to go by his old name of Orion Pax, and agrees to leave Cybertron forever in exchange for the Autobots being allowed to stay.|$|E

5|$|The clumpy {{structure}} of the dust belt {{may be explained by}} gravitational perturbation from a planet, dubbed Epsilon Eridani b. The clumps in the dust occur at orbits that have an integer resonance with the orbit of the suspected <b>planet.</b> <b>For</b> example, the region of the disk that completes two orbits for every three orbits of a planet is in a 3:2 orbital resonance. In computer simulations the ring morphology can be reproduced by the capture of dust particles in 5:3 and 3:2 orbital resonances with a planet that has an orbital eccentricity of about 0.3. Alternatively, the clumpiness may have been caused by collisions between minor planets known as plutinos.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to orbit Jupiter was the Galileo probe, which entered orbit on December 7, 1995. It orbited the <b>planet</b> <b>for</b> over seven years, conducting multiple flybys {{of all the}} Galilean moons and Amalthea. The spacecraft also witnessed the impact of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 as it approached Jupiter in 1994, giving a unique vantage point for the event. Its originally designed capacity was limited by the failed deployment of its high-gain radio antenna, although extensive information was still gained about the Jovian system from Galileo.|$|E
5|$|The {{transporter}} {{had originally}} been developed for the television series {{as a matter of}} convenience; it would have been prohibitively expensive to show the Enterprise land on every new <b>planet.</b> <b>For</b> the redesign Michelson felt that the transporter should look and feel more powerful. He added a sealed control room that would protect operators from the powerful forces at work. The space between the transporter platform and the operators was filled with complex machinery, and cinematographer Richard Kline added eerie lighting to the set to create atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|With {{the dispute}} resolved, the {{discovery}} team proposed Eris on September 6, 2006. On September 13, 2006 this name {{was accepted as}} the official name by the IAU. Brown decided that, because the object had been considered a <b>planet</b> <b>for</b> so long, it deserved a name from Greek or Roman mythology, like the other planets. The asteroids had taken {{the vast majority of}} Graeco-Roman names. Eris, whom Brown described as his favorite goddess, had fortunately escaped inclusion. The name in part reflects the discord in the astronomical community caused by the debate over the object's (and Pluto's) classification.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to orbit Jupiter was the Galileo orbiter, which went into orbit around Jupiter on December 7, 1995. It orbited the <b>planet</b> <b>for</b> over seven years, making 35 orbits {{before it was}} destroyed during a controlled impact with Jupiter on September 21, 2003. During this period, it gathered {{a large amount of}} information about the Jovian system; the amount of information was not as great as intended because the deployment of its high-gain radio transmitting antenna failed. The major events during the eight-year study included multiple flybys of all of the Galilean moons, as well as Amalthea (the first probe to do so). It also witnessed the impact of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 as it approached Jupiter in 1994 and the sending of an atmospheric probe into the Jovian atmosphere in December 1995.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise then learns of {{an unmarked}} vessel {{approaching}} Haven. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) recognizes it as Tarellian, {{a race that}} they had thought to be wiped out by a highly lethal and contagious virus. When they contact the ship, they find a handful of Tarellian refugees that have been travelling at sub-light speeds to Haven in hopes of finding an isolated location to live {{out the rest of}} their lives in peace. Picard insists they cannot go to the <b>planet</b> <b>for</b> fear of spreading the virus, and has the Tarellian vessel placed in a tractor beam. Wyatt recognizes one of the Tarellians, Ariana (Danitza Kingsley), from his dreams, and she too recognizes Wyatt. Wyatt tells Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) that he will transport some medical supplies to them, but transports himself along with the supplies. When the crew discovers this, Wyatt's parents demand Picard bring Wyatt back to the Enterprise, but Picard insists that he cannot return, as Wyatt would now carry the Tarellian virus. Wyatt promises his parents, Troi, and the rest of the crew that he knew that this would be destiny, and is happy to try to help cure the Tarellian virus. Wyatt convinces the Tarellians to leave Haven and search for help elsewhere. Picard orders the tractor beam to be dropped and allows the vessel to depart the system.|$|E
