5000|$|Afterwards, {{the plates}} can be [...] "erased," [...] by exposing the plate to room-intensity white light. Thereby, the plate {{can be used}} over and over again. Imaging plates can {{theoretically}} be re-used thousands of times if they are handled carefully and under certain radiation exposure conditions. PSP <b>plate</b> <b>handling</b> under industrial conditions often results in damage after a few hundred uses. Mechanical damage such as scratches and abrasions are common, as well as radiation fatigue or imprinting due to high energy applications. An image can be erased by simply exposing the plate to a room-level fluorescent light - but more efficient, complete erasure is required to avoid signal carry-over and artifacts. Most laser scanners automatically erase the plate (current technology uses red LED lighting) after laser scanning is complete. The imaging plate can then be re-used.|$|E

40|$|When {{compared}} to methodologies based on low adhesion or hanging drop plates, droplet microfluidics offers several advantages {{for the formation}} and culture of multicellular spheroids, such as the potential for higher throughput screening {{and the use of}} reduced cell numbers, whilst providing increased stability for <b>plate</b> <b>handling.</b> However, a drawback of the technology is its characteristic compartmentalisation which limits the nutrients available to cells within an emulsion and poses challenges to the exchange of the encapsulated solution, often resulting in short-term cell culture and/or viability issues. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a multi-purpose microfluidic platform that combines the high-throughput characteristics of multi-phase flows with that of ease of perfusion typical of single-phase microfluidics.

40|$|Generation and {{interpretation}} of biotransformation data on drugs, i. e. identification of physiologically relevant metabolites, defining metabolic pathways and elucidation of metabolite structures, have become increasingly important to the drug development process. Profiling using (14) C or (3) H radiolabel {{is defined as the}} chromatographic separation and quantification of drug-related material in a given biological sample derived from an in vitro, preclinical in vivo or clinical study. Metabolite profiling is a very time intensive activity, particularly for preclinical in vivo or clinical studies which have defined limitations on radiation burden and exposure levels. A clear gap exists for certain studies which do not require specialized high volume automation technologies, yet these studies would still clearly benefit from automation. Use of radiolabeled compounds in preclinical and clinical ADME studies, specifically for metabolite profiling and identification are a very good example. The current lack of automation for measuring low level radioactivity in metabolite profiling requires substantial capacity, personal attention and resources from laboratory scientists. To help address these challenges and improve efficiency, we have innovated, developed and implemented a novel and flexible automation platform that integrates a robotic <b>plate</b> <b>handling</b> platform, HPLC or UPLC system, mass spectrometer and an automated fraction collector...|$|E

40|$|Laser welding is a {{promising}} technique for welding thick metal sheets, {{which is usually}} used for achieving full penetration in a single weld pass. However, among the imperfections that can occur, dropout formation becomes an increasingly larger problem when the sheets to be welded get thicker. When the sheets are 15 mm or thicker {{it is a challenge}} to suppress and countermeasures to suppress dropouts get less impact. If full penetration is not achieved, the dropout formation cannot be formed and the melt flows to form better weld caps. Therefore a typical method when welding 15 mm and thicker is to use partial penetration {{from both sides of the}} joint and thereby achieving full penetration, at a cost of increasing <b>plate</b> <b>handling</b> complexities and time losses. If the mechanisms behind the dropout formation can be understood, countermeasures may be developed and applied in order to be able to laser weld thicker plates with full penetration single pass welding. In order to understand the mechanics of the formation of dropout during full penetration welding in 15 mm thick plates, experiments have been conducted using laser hybrid arc welding (LAHW) using the laser in CW mode and also applying power modulation. During the experiments, the root has been observed with High Speed Imaging (HSI) to observe the mechanisms behind the formation. It is determined that the downward flow from the keyhole along with the surface tensional forces of the molten steel and its cooling rate play the most significant roles.

A challenge in using such approach for damaging structures {{stems from the fact}} that vibration modes can be adjusted only during the training stage of the analysis; if damage occurs or grows when the reduced-order model is at work, the training stage has to be re-started.
