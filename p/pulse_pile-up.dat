40|$|Using Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) for {{the purpose}} of {{fluorescence}} lifetime measurements is usually limited in speed due to pile-up. With modern instrumentation this limitation can be lifted significantly but some artefacts due to frequent merging of closely spaced detector pulses (detector <b>pulse</b> <b>pile-up)</b> remains an issue to be addressed. We propose here a data analysis method correcting for this type of artefact and the resulting systematic errors. It physically models the photon losses due to detector <b>pulse</b> <b>pile-up</b> and incorporates the loss in the decay fit model employed to obtain fluorescence lifetimes and relative amplitudes of the decay components. Comparison of results with and without this correction show a significant reduction of systematic errors at count rates approaching the excitation rate. This allows quantitatively accurate fluorescense lifetime imaging (FLIM) at very high frame rates.

40|$|In the {{application}} of semiconductor detectors, the charge-sensitive amplifier is widely used in front-end electronics. The output signal is shaped by a typical exponential decay. Depending on the feedback network, this type of front-end electronics suffers from the ballistic deficit problem, or an increased rate of <b>pulse</b> <b>pile-ups.</b> Moreover, spectroscopy applications require a correction of the pulse-height, while a shortened pulse-width is desirable for high-throughput applications.

40|$|For {{experiments}} with high arrival rates, reliable identification of nearly-coincident events can be crucial. For calorimetric measurements to directly measure the neutrino mass such as HOLMES, unidentified <b>pulse</b> <b>pile-ups</b> {{are expected to}} be a leading source of experimental error. Although Wiener filtering can be used to recognize pile-up, it suffers errors due to pulse-shape variation from detector nonlinearity, readout dependence on sub-sample arrival times, and stability issues from the ill-posed deconvolution problem of recovering Dirac delta-functions from smooth data. Due to these factors, we have developed a processing method that exploits singular value decomposition to (1) separate single-pulse records from piled-up records in training data and (2) construct a model of single-pulse records that accounts for varying pulse shape with amplitude, arrival time, and baseline level, suitable for detecting nearly-coincident events. We show that the resulting processing advances can reduce the required performance specifications of the detectors and readout system or, equivalently, enable larger sensor arrays and better constraints on the neutrino mass.

40|$|With present-day {{detectors}} in {{high energy}} physics one is often faced with short analog pulses {{of a few}} nanoseconds length which may cover large dynamic ranges. In many experiments both amplitude and timing information have to be measured with high accuracy.

40|$|Ulysses was {{launched}} in October 1990, and its Solar X-ray/Cosmic Gamma-Ray Burst Experiment (GRB) has provided more than 13 years of uninterrupted observations of solar X-ray flare activity. Due to the large variation of the relative solar latitude and longitude of the spacecraft orbit {{with respect to the}} Earth, the perspective of the GRB instrument often differed significantly from that of X-ray instruments on Earth-orbiting satellites. During extended periods the GRB experiment made direct observations of flares on the hidden face of the Sun, providing a unique record of events not visible to other instruments. The small detector area of GRB and its optimization for very high counting rates minimized the effects of <b>pulse</b> <b>pile-up.</b> We interpret the spectra, time histories, and occurrence distribution patterns of GRB data in terms of “thermal feed-through”, the confusion of thermal soft X-rays and non-thermal hard X-rays. This effect is a systematic problem for scintillation-counter spectrometers observing the solar hard X-ray spectrum.

40|$|Abstract The main {{background}} hindering low-energy (≲ 200 keV) neutrino measurements {{with liquid}} scintillators {{comes from the}} minute remanence of the cosmogenic ¹⁴C (T 1 / 2 ≃ 5700 a) present in the organic oil constituting {{the bulk of the}} scintillator. The β-decay endpoint energy of ¹⁴C is quite low, Q = 156 keV, and the counting rate from ¹⁴C is often reduced by threshold settings. However, too high concentration of ¹⁴C may results in <b>pile-up</b> <b>pulses.</b> For example, in the Borexino detector at Gran Sasso, Italy, being the most sensitive neutrino detector, the trigger rate is largely dominated by the ¹⁴C isotope [1] with the concentration of 2 &# 215; 10 - 18 [2] It is the lowest ¹⁴C concentration value ever measured. There are only a few results available on the ¹⁴C concentration. In addition to the one in Ref. [2] there are three other measurements reported in Refs. [3, 4, 5]. Obviously ¹⁴C cannot be removed from liquid scintillators by chemical methods, or by other methods in large quantities (liters). In principle, the older is the oil or gas source that the liquid scintillator is made of and the deeper it situates, the smaller the ¹⁴C concentration should be. This, however, is not generally the case and it is believed that the ratio depends on the activity (U and Th content) in the environment of the source. We are performing a series of measurements where the ¹⁴C concentration will be measured from several liquid scintillator samples. They need low-background environment and are taking place in two deep underground laboratories: in the new CallioLab laboratory in the Pyhäsalmi mine, Finland, and at the Baksan Neutrino Observatory, Russia, in order to reduce and better understand the systematical uncertainties.

40|$|This thesis {{treats the}} {{development}} of Ion Beam Analysis (IBA) methods, principally {{for the analysis of}} light elements at a nuclear microprobe (NMP). The light elements are in this context defined as those with an atomic number Z of less than approximately 13 (aluminium). The work reported is to a large extent based upon multiparameter methods. Several signals are acquired simultaneously, and the data can be effectively analyzed to reveal structures that cannot be observed through one-parameter collection. Hydrogen analysis is performed through the H(p,p) H reaction, where the two protons are measured in coincidence at 45 o. A specially designed annular silicon surface barrier detector (SBD) that is devided into two halves is used for the proton detection. This is a forward scattering technique, which requires thin samples. Lithium is measured through the 7 Li(p,a) a reaction, where the two a particles are ejected almost back-to-back. This is utilised so that the two a particles are detected in coincidence by two annular SBDs, one in the forward direction and one in the backward direction. Two different set-ups for macro- and microanalysis is reported. The technique is applied to the analysis of Li drugs. The reaction used for boron analysis is the broad resonance at 662 keV of 11 B(p,a) 8 Be*, 8 Be* -> a + a; any of the a particles can be used for analysis. The technique is applied to Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT). The 19 F(p,a) 16 O*, 16 O* (0 +) -> 16 O (0 +) + e- + e+ (internal pair production) is used for fluorine analysis. Any of the electron or positron is detected in coincidence with the a particle in order to suppress the background of the a particle. The technique is applied to problems related to odontology. To perform STIM (Scanning Transmission Ion Microscopy) at high beam currents, off-axis STIM is used so that STIM and the techniques for elemental analysis can be performed simultaneously. The above mentioned techniques are, by the work reported in this thesis, combined in a new set-up at the Lund Nuclear Microprobe. The various detectors for reaction products are arranged {{in such a way that}} they can be used for the simultaneous analysis of hydrogen, lithium, boron and fluorine together with traditional PIXE (Particle Induced X-ray Emission) analysis and STIM as well as pNRA (photon-tagged Nuclear Reaction Analysis).

40|$|The {{first part}} of this work reports the {{elementary}} theory of the atomic photoeffect presented in a form that is suited for practical numerical calculation. A detailed derivation of subshell cross sections for both excitation and ionization, comprising the angular distributions of emitted photoelectrons, is presented taking into account the effect of the polarization of the photons. The theoretical formulas have been implemented in a computer program PHOTACS that calculates tables of excitation and ionization cross sections for any element and subshell. Numerical calculations are practicable for excitations to final states with the principal quantum number up to about 20 and for ionization by photons with energy up to about 2 MeV. The effect of the finite width of atomic energy levels is accounted for by convolving the calculated subshell cross section with a Lorentzian profile. The second part of this work reports unfolding strategies for correcting a radiation measurement from the effects of the detector-pulse handling circuitry system. These strategies comprise the correction from the effects of <b>pulse</b> <b>pile-up</b> (PPU) and the detector response function (DRF). A first principles balance equation for second order PPU is derived and solved for the particular case of rectangular pulse shape.

40|$|Measurements of {{ambient dose}} {{equivalent}} in stray radiation fields behind the shielding of high-energy accelerators are a challenging task. Several radiation components (photons, neutrons, charged particles, muons, etc.), spanning {{a wide range of}} energies, contribute to the total dose equivalent. The radiation fields are produced by beam losses interacting with structural material during the acceleration or at the ejection to experimental areas or other accelerators. The particle beam is usually not continuous but separated in "bunches" or pulses, which further complicates dose measurements at high-energy accelerators. An ideal dosimeter for operational radiation protection should measure dose equivalent for any composition of radiation components in the entire energy range even when the field is strongly pulsed. The objective of this work was to find out if an ionisation chamber operated as a "recombination chamber" and a TEPC instrument using the variance-covariance method ("Sievert Instrument") are capable of assessing the {{ambient dose equivalent}} in radiation fields with short pulses. The results are compared to those of a conventional TEPC instrument (HANDI-TEPC) and to the total dose equivalent values obtained from the suitable combination of readings from instruments currently used at CERN. These instruments are a combination of several detectors with different characteristics measuring individual dose fractions (i. e. an argon-filled chamber, a hydrogen-filled chamber and a rem ionisation chamber). The HANDI-TEPC is usually the preferred reference instrument in mixed radiation fields of unknown composition at CERN, but in strongly pulsed fields it fails because of pile-up effects. Although the mixed stray radiation fields differ strongly from those applied in standard calibration, the first step in using a radiation protection instrument is the intensive study and characterisation of the detector behaviour in reference fields of calibration sources. This forms the basis for improving the reliability and accuracy of measurements in unknown radiation fields. The next step is to test the detectors in mixed reference fields, which simulate workplace fields but are produced under laboratory conditions. At CERN, an opportunity for such a reference field is realized by the CERF-field (CERN-EU high-energy reference field). The field provides a mixed field of mainly neutrons ranging from thermal energies up to hundreds of GeV accompanied by photons and muons. At CERF the HANDI-TEPC was known to be suitable {{to be used as a}} reference instrument for the total dose equivalent. For this reason the results of the recombination chamber and Sievert Instrument were compared to those of the HANDI-TEPC for several reference locations and different beam intensities. In particular, the background radiation at CERF was studied, which has a non-negligible influence on the total dose equivalent and is strongly dependent on the reference location. At CERF, a very good agreement between the instruments was found. Finally the instruments were investigated in an unknown mixed stray radiation field with short pulses on the "PS-bridge". This PS-bridge is a location where 260 cm of concrete shield the beam line of the PS accelerator. The operation of the PS at CERN is composed of a supercycle of 16. 8 s divided in 14 cycles of 1. 2 s each. The duration of the particle pulse can be as short as 10 µs. In such a field the HANDI-TEPC was not able to resolve the single events within one particle <b>pulse</b> because of <b>pile-up</b> effects. The recombination chamber and the Sievert Instrument, however, appear to be capable of assessing the total dose equivalent correctly provided that the response is interpreted carefully by using appropriate corrections and calibration factors...|$|R
40|$|Silicon drift {{detectors}} (SDDs) revolutionized spectroscopy {{in fields}} {{as diverse as}} geology and dentistry. For a subset of experiments at ultra-fast, x-ray free-electron lasers (FELs), SDDs can make substantial contributions. Often the unknown spectrum is interesting, carrying science data, or the background measurement is useful to identify unexpected signals. Many measurements involve only several discrete photon energies known a priori. We designed a pulse function (a combination of gradual step and exponential decay function) and demonstrated that for individual pulses the signal amplitude, peaking time, and pulse amplitude are interrelated and the signal amplitude and peaking time are obtained for each pulse by fitting. Avoiding pulse shaping reduced peaking times to tens of nanoseconds, resulting in reduced <b>pulse</b> <b>pile-up</b> and allowing decomposition of remaining <b>pulse</b> <b>pile-up</b> at photon separation times down to 100 ~ns while yielding time-of-arrival information with precision of 10 ~nanoseconds. At pulsed sources or high photon rates, photon pile-up still occurs. We showed that the area of one photon peaks is not suitable for estimating high photon rates while pile-up spectrum fitting is relatively simple and preferable to pile-up spectrum deconvolution. We developed a photon pile-up model for constant intensity sources, extended it to variable intensity sources (typical for FELs) {{and used it to}} fit a complex pile-up spectrum, demonstrating its accuracy. Based on the pile-up model, we developed a Bayesian pile-up decomposition method that allows decomposing pile-up of single events with up to 6 photons from 6 monochromatic lines with 99 % accuracy. The usefulness of SDDs will continue into the x-ray FEL era of science. Their successors, the ePixS hybrid pixel detectors, already offer hundreds of pixels, each with similar performance to an SDD, in a compact, robust and affordable package.

40|$|A {{system of}} 500 MHz {{transient}} digitizers based on gallium arsenide resistive gate charged coupled devices {{has been developed}} for an experiment studying rare K decays. CCDs with dynamic range of 8 -bits and 128 or 320 pixels are used as analog pipelines. The CCDs are driven by a single phase transport system. Data readout and manipulation occurs at 15 : 6 MHz. (Submitted to Nucl. Instr. and Meth. A) 1 Introduction Pipeline digitizing of detector signals is a powerful technique for measuring time, amplitude and shape variations due, for example, to <b>pulse</b> <b>pile-up.</b> Experiment E 787 at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) is a measurement of the ultra-rare decay K + ! ß + {{which is expected to}} have a branching ratio in the range 1 Γ 3 Θ 10 Γ 10 [1]. To achieve effective background suppression at such low signal levels while operating at very high rates, two types of high speed digitizers were developed for sampling fast scintillation counter signals from photomultiplier t [...] ...|$|E
40|$|When pulse-height spectra are {{measured}} by a nuclear detection system at high counting rates, the probability that two or more pulses will arrive within the resolving time {{of the system is}} significant. This phenomenon, <b>pulse</b> <b>pile-up,</b> distorts the pulse-height spectrum and must be considered in the interpretation of spectra taken at high counting rates. A computational technique for the simulation of pile-up is developed. The model is examined in the three regimes where (1) the time between pulses is long compared to the detector-system resolving time, (2) the time between pulses is comparable to the resolving time, and (3) many pulses occur within the resolving time. The technique is used to model the solar hard X-ray experiment on the OSO- 7 satellite; comparison of the model with data taken during three large flares shows excellent agreement. The paper also describes rule-of-thumb tests for pile-up and identifies the important detector design factors for minimizing pile-up, i. e., thick entrance windows and short resolving times in the system electronics...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the possibility of extracting correct structural parameters from fluorescence EXAFS data taken at high count rates with an energy-resolving detector. This situation is often encountered on third-generation synchrotron radiation sources which provide a high flux on the sample. Errors caused by <b>pulse</b> <b>pile-up</b> in the extraction of structural information have been quantified in a real experiment, and different approaches {{to the problem of}} data correction have been elaborated. The different approaches are discussed in a comparison of the ability of each kind of correction to recover the correct structural parameters. The result of our analysis is {{that it is possible to}} work in non-linear conditions and correct the data, if the response of the acquisition system is known. Reliable structural information can be obtained with data acquired up to a count rate equal to approximately 60 % of the inverse of the dead time...|$|E
40|$|The 4 pig-counting {{technique}} {{is recognized as}} a powerful primary method for the standardization of radionuclides decaying with abundant gamma emissions. Based {{on the use of}} a gamma detector in quasi 4 pi-geometry, a detection efficiency close to 100 % and a low uncertainty can be achieved thanks to the summing effect of subsequent gamma transitions. Uncertainties have to be assigned to the realistic modelling of the source-detector geometry with respect to dimensions, density and material composition, the calculation of the total counting efficiency of the detector for the various emitted radiation and the effect of possible flaws in the decay scheme of a radionuclide on the calculated total efficiency. Other uncertainty factors pertain to typical metrological sources of uncertainty, such as weighing, nuclear counting with <b>pulse</b> <b>pile-up</b> and system dead-time effects, impurity corrections, decay corrections, timing and frequency, etc. In order to ensure good metrological practices at NMIs, the uncertainties particular to the method are discussed.

40|$|The {{half-life}} of Ne- 18 {{has been}} determined by detecting 1042 -keV gamma rays in the daughter F- 18 following the superallowed-Fermi beta(+) decay of samples implanted {{at the center of}} the 8 pi gamma-ray spectrometer, a spherical array of 20 HPGe detectors. Radioactive Ne- 18 beams were produced on-line, mass-separated, and ionized using an electron-cyclotron-resonance ionization source at the ISAC facility at TRIUMF in Vancouver, Canada. This is the first high-precision half-life measurement of a superallowed Fermi beta decay to utilize both a large-scale HPGe spectrometer and the isotope separation on-line technique. The half-life of Ne- 18, 1. 6656 +/- 0. 0019 s, deduced following a 1. 4 sigma correction for detector <b>pulse</b> <b>pile-up,</b> is four times more precise than the previous world average. As part of an investigation into potential systematic effects, the half-life of the heavier isotope Ne- 23 was determined to be 37. 11 +/- 0. 06 s, a factor of 2 improvement over the previous precision. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|The {{origins of}} all these {{imperfections}} {{can be explained by}} the noise on the photon counts, which propagates to noise in the decomposed sinograms and ultimately to the material maps. In addition to the inherent quantum noise, physical effects such as <b>pulse</b> <b>pile-up</b> and charge sharing as well as inaccuracies in the spectral model of the system (e.g. x-ray tube spectrum, detector response function) will further degrade the quantification results if not properly addressed in the forward model which is solved by the maximum likelihood decomposition [1, 16]. The decomposition and reconstruction algorithms are still under development. Quantification improvements are expected as more accurate models and further noise handling algorithms will be applied. For example, researchers are actively looking into including some of the still un-modelled physical effects and enhancing the accuracy of the incident spectrum and detector response function [36, 37]. Additionally, mitigating the noise would probably require using regularised iterative methods, either during the material decomposition process [38], during the reconstruction process [39] or in a one-step algorithm that would embed both processes [40].|$|E
