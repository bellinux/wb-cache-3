40|$|Abstract: Building a {{scalable}} {{and highly}} integrated systems {{is an important}} re-search direction and one of key technologies in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Au-tonomous helicopter is a typical CPS application and its flight presents challenges in <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system design with scalability. In this paper, we present the integration architecture of hardware and software for the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system based TREX 600 helicopter. In order to enhance scalability, the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system uses the PC 104 and the ARM which is exerted to process the measurement data, including the posi-tion, attitude, height etc. The <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> is developed based multi-loop decoupling PI control which is easy to be implemented. Finally, the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system is successfully verified in the actual autonomous <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> experiment...|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} {{usability}} testing {{is the development}} of fly-by-wire <b>flight</b> <b>controls.</b> Fly-by-wire <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> eliminate the mechanical linkages between the <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> and the aircraft control surfaces. Sensors communicate the demanded flight response and then apply realistic force feedback to the fly-by-wire controls using motors. The behavior of fly-by-wire <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> is defined by control algorithms. Changes in algorithm parameters can translate into more or less flight response from a given <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> input. Likewise, changes in the algorithm parameters can also translate into more or less force feedback for a given <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> input. The “correct” parameter values are a subjective measure. Therefore, it is important to get input from numerous man-in-the-loop tests to obtain optimal parameter values.|$|R

40|$|The F/A- 18 Hornet {{aircraft}} {{with the}} original <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> law exhibited an out-of-control phenomenon known as the falling leaf mode. The falling leaf mode went unde-tected during the validation and verification stage of the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> law. Several F/A- 18 Hornet aircraft were lost due to the falling leaf mode {{which led to the}} redesign of the lateral-directional axis of the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> law. The revised <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> law exhibited successful suppression of the falling leaf mode during flight tests with aggressive maneuvers. Prior to performing expensive flight tests, the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> law was extensively validated and verified by performing linear robustness analysis at different trim points and running many Monte-Carlo simulations. Additional insight can be gained by using nonlinear anal-yses. This paper compares the two <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> laws using nonlinear region-of-attraction analyses and Monte Carlo simulations. The results of these nonlinear analyses indicate that the revised <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> law has better significantly improved nonlinear robustness properties as compared with baseline design...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWith control using {{redundant}} multiple {{control surface}} arrangement and large-deflection drag rudders, a combat flying wing {{has a higher}} probability for control surface failures. Therefore, its <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system {{must be able to}} reconfigure after such failures. Considering three types of typical control surface failures (lock-in-place (LIP), loss-of-effectiveness (LOE) and float), <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> reconfiguration characteristic and capability of such aircraft types are analyzed. Because of the control surface redundancy, the aircraft using the dynamic inversion <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> law already has a control allocation block. In this paper, its <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> configuration during the above failures is achieved by modifying this block. It is shown that such a reconfigurable <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> design is valid, through numerical simulations of <b>flight</b> attitude <b>control</b> task. Results indicate that, in the circumstances of control surface failures with limited degree and the degradation of the flying quality level, a combat flying wing adopting this <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> reconfiguration approach based on control allocation could guarantee its flight safety and perform some flight combat missions...|$|R
40|$|A <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system's task is {{to process}} and {{distribute}} signals under real time conditions. Such a <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system has to be extremely reliable and still be capable of tolerating arbitrary faults. A <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> computer system consists of several autonomous processing-units, the so-called nodes. A time-independant model was developed to abstract the communication messages of the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system. This model is used to identify system assumptions, characteristic features and their relationship assuming arbitrary faults. A node has the 'jurisdiction to isolate other nodes' and is itself failure-propagation-boundary and thus potential elimination level. If a node is clearly identified as being faulty on the local level, the desire to isolate the node {{is sent to the}} so-called isolators, which will reconfigure the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system if a certain amount of other nodes are in agreement. It is proven that 'isolating' <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> systems do not require stronger minimal redundancy level constraints than ordinary 'masking' <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> systems. (orig.)
