40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to characterize 318 Salmonella enteritidis strains that were mainly isolated from poultry and their environment in Canada. Biotype, <b>phagetype</b> (PT), plasmid profile (PP), hybridization with a plasmid-derived virulence sequence probe, antibiotic resistance, outer membrane proteins (OMPs), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) profiles were determined. Relationships of these properties to one another, and their diagnostic and pathogenic significance were assessed. Biotyping indicated that failure to ferment rhamnose was sometimes useful as a marker for epidemiologically related strains. Phagetyping was the most effective method for subdividing S. enteritidis; it distinguished 12 PTs. <b>Phagetype</b> 13 was occasionally associated with septicemia and mortality in chickens. The strains belonged to 15 PPs. A 36 megadalton (MDa) plasmid was found in 97 % of the strains. Only the 36 MDa plasmid hybridized with the probe.

Twenty-nine laboratories sent about 150 MRSA-isolates of patients and personnel in 1989. These isolates were <b>phagetyped</b> by the Laboratory for Bacteriology and M. I. C. -values for about 14 antibiotics were determined in the Laboratory for Chemotherapy. Thirty-two <b>phagetypes</b> were found of which twenty <b>phagetypes</b> were isolated only once. Of the more frequent <b>phagetypes,</b> expecially <b>phagetypes</b> "g" and "e", were by far most prevalent, being isolated fifty and fifty-five times respectively. Both <b>phagetypes</b> were associated with hospital epidemics in the Netherlands in and before 1989. Almost all MRSA- isolates were multiresistant strains. One third of the isolates was resistant to rifampicin, and only one fourth of MRSA-isolates was resistant to cotrimoxazole. All isolates were sensitive to fusidic acid and vancomycin. Introduction of a MRSA-strain into a Dutch hospital {{is often associated with}} transfer of patients, who have been nursed in a foreign hospital. They have been colonized with an "endemic" MRSA-strain in this hospital. Strict isolation procedures of these patients in Dutch hospitals are necessary till repeated routine cultures are negative for MRSA.

40|$|To obtain {{reliable}} {{quantitative data}} on the occurrence of zoonotic bacteria in farm animals in The Netherlands, a surveillance programme was implemented in April 1997. Results for January 1998 through December 2000 are presented in this report. In this period, faecal samples from in total 2, 378 flocks/herds of layers, broilers, finishing pigs, dairy cattle and veal calves were examined {{for the presence of}} Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp. and/or verocytotoxin-producing E. coli O 157. Questionnaires were used to obtain data for risk factor analyses. For layers, prevalences of salmonella positive flocks were 12 % (1998, using Rappaport-Vassiliadis (RV) as selective enrichment medium) and averaged around 20 % in 1999 and 2000 (using both RV and modified semisolid RV (MSRV)); for broilers, the salmonella prevalence declined from 28 % (1998, RV) to 16 % (2000, RV & MSRV). For finishing pig, 34 % (1998; 4 th quarter only), 13 % (1999) and 16 % (2000) positive herds were identified, while for dairy cattle and veal calves, salmonella prevalences were around 3 % (based on the use of RV only). Serotype discrimination showed the predominance of S. Enteritidis (mainly <b>phagetype</b> PT 4) in layers in all years; for broilers this serotype prevailed until 1999, whereas S. Paratyphi B var.

The campylobacter prevalence in broilers decreased from 31 % (1998) to 18 % (1999), reaching 24 % in 2000. Finishing pigs, dairy cattle and veal calves showed lower campylobacter prevalences for 1999 compared to 1998. C. jejuni was the dominating species in broilers and dairy cattle, whereas C. coli predominated in pigs; both species prevailed equally in veal calves. Prevalence estimates for E. coli O 157 in dairy cattle were 5 % (1998), 8 % (1999) and 6 % (2000; 8 % with an adjusted processing of samples); for veal calves these were 5 % (1998), 9 % (1999) and 11 % (2000; 17 % with the adjusted method).

40|$|Abstract Background Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica {{is one of}} {{the leading}} food-borne {{pathogens}} in the USA and European countries. Outcome of human Salmonella serotype Typhimurium infections ranges from mild self-limiting diarrhoea to severe diarrhoea that requires hospitalization. Increased knowledge of the mechanisms that are responsible for causing infection and especially the severity of infection is of high interest. Results Strains were selected from patients with mild infections (n = 9) and patients with severe infections (n = 9) and clinical data allowed us to correct for known underlying diseases. Additionally, outbreak isolates (n = 3) were selected. Strains were analyzed on a DNA-DNA microarray for presence or absence of 281 genes covering marker groups of genes related to pathogenicity, phages, antimicrobial resistance, fimbriae, mobility, serotype and metabolism. Strains showed highly similar profiles when comparing virulence associated genes, but differences between strains were detected in the prophage marker group. The Salmonella virulence plasmid was present in 72 % of the strains, but presence or absence of the virulence plasmid did not correspond to disease symptoms. A dendrogram clustered strains into four groups. Clustering confirmed DT 104 as being a clonal <b>phagetype.</b> Clustering of the remaining strains was mainly correlated to presence or absence of the virulence plasmid and mobile elements such as transposons. Each of the four clusters in the tree represented an almost equal amount of strains causing severe or mild symptoms of infection. Conclusions We investigated clinical significance of known virulence factors of Salmonella serotype Typhimurium strains causing different disease symptoms, and conclude that the few detected differences in Salmonella serotype Typhimurium do not affect outcome of human disease. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{protozoa}} are {{a diverse}} group of eukaryotic microorganisms that employ a variety of life strategies. Many protozoa are free-living while others are commensal organisms that thrive within the gut of vertebrates. In addition, a relatively small group of parasitic protozoa represent serious health threats to humans and animals. Certain free-living, commensal, and parasitic protozoa are bactivorous and rely on bacteria as a food source. However, some intracellular bacterial pathogens survive engulfment and thrive within these protozoa. This dissertation describes the investigation of Salmonella hypervirulence following bacterial engulfment and characterizes physiologic interactions between various protozoa and bacteria. Initial studies entailed characterization of in vitro and in vivo Salmonella hypervirulence following engulfment by free-living and commensal bactivorous protozoa. This work revealed that Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium <b>phagetype</b> DT 104 survive protozoan engulfment and use the intracellular environment as a venue for plasmid transfer and activation of virulence genes. In subsequent studies, receptors from ciliated protozoa were investigated with a strategy involving molecular cloning, RNA interference, and heterologous expression in yeast. These studies revealed the involvement of protozoan G protein-coupled receptors and a cyclic nucleotide binding protein in bacterial engulfment. The yeast expression system was then used to deorphanize a G protein-coupled receptor from Entamoeba histolytica, demonstrating that bacterial lipopolysaccharide is an agonist of this receptor. Engulfment assays demonstrated that E. histolytica trophozoites preferred to engulf bacteria with intact LPS and this process was sensitive to inhibition of G protein signaling. In summary, a variety of protozoa facilitate salmonellosis, G protein-coupled receptors play a role in bacterial engulfment by protozoa, and these receptors represent novel drug targets worthy of further exploration...|$|E
40|$|In Arabidopsis thaliana three nucleus-encoded <b>phagetype</b> RNA polymerases (RpoT; 1, RpoT; 2 and RpoT; 3) were cloned. They show a conserved gene {{structure}} and {{have up to}} 55 % aminoacid homology. By means of in organelle -import approaches and by using GFP-fusion-proteins, the localization of these three enzymes in different organelles was possible. Therefore RpoT; 1 is only needed in mitochondria, RpoT; 3 is targeted to plastids. In contrast to this, RNA polymerase 2 (RpoT; 2) is imported in both plastids and mitochondria. Transcript reduction of each distinct RNA polymerase by means of antisense -approaches led to reduction of the expression. Transgenic antisense -plants displayed in part severe phenotype changes, e. g. root- and shoot-reduction, leave- and shoot-deformation including bleached and anthocyan-discoulored leaves. Thus genomic 5 '-parts of the RNA polymerase sequences caused much stronger effects than 3 '-ends. However, usage of cDNA constructs led to an overexpression of all three RNA polymerases. Comparison of knock-out-lines for each RNA polymerase revealed that replacing RpoT; 1 {{by one of the}} other two RNA polymerases (RpoT; 2 or RpoT; 3) seems to be impossible. Loss of RpoT; 1 causes lethal effects to the embryo in early plant developmental stages. Knock-out-lines for RpoT; 3 showed an at least partial replacement by RNA polymerase 2 (RpoT; 2). Examinations of RpoT; 2 - antisense plants, which showed trancript reduction for RNA polymerase 2, revealed an effect on RNA editing of specific sites (rpoB). All these facts seem to suggest that each of the three RNA polymerases is capable of exercising a specific function at certain stages of plant development. Therefore the possibility of a replacement by another RpoT is possible only to a limited degree...|$|E

Following the challenge, each group was stored at 8 ºC or at 25 ºC, {{and the presence of}} S. enteritidis in the eggshell and internal content was evaluated after zero, 24, 96 and 168 hours. The use of QA demonstrated efficiency in S. enteritidis reduction of eggshell. The eggs stored at 8 ºC revealed preponderancy in the reduction and the absence of S. enteritidis at the eggshell. In the TW washed eggs, the storage at 25 ºC allowed the eggshell bacteria maintenance until 168 hours. There was not any detection of S. enteritidis at the internal content of eggs in any of the groups...|$|E
40|$|Realizou-se a pesquisa de S. aureus em {{material}} de vestíbulo nasal de 78 manipuladores de alimentos que trabalhavam nas cozinhas de 8 hospitais. As cepas isoladas, após a sua identificação bioquímica, foram submetidas a provas de fagotipagem e à verificação da capacidade produtora de enterotoxina estafilocócica. Na produção de enterotoxina utilizou-se um método de cultura em saco de celofane. Nas provas de fagotipagem foram empregados os fagos do Conjunto Básico Internacional e mais sete experimentais (86, 88, 89, 90, 92, D 11 e HK 2) e dois extras (187 e 42 D). Dos manipuladores examinados, 33 (42, 3 %) revelaram-se portadores nasais de S. aureus, sendo que de 5 (6, 4 %) foram isoladas cepas produtoras de enterotoxina estafilocócica. De dois isolaram-se cepas produtoras de enterotoxina do tipo B e dos outros três indivíduos, cepas produtoras de enterotoxinas dos tipos C, AE e ABE, respectivamente. Das 59 submetidas à fagotipagem, 54 (91, 5 %) revelaram-se fagotipáveis. Houve predominância de cepas lisadas por fagos do grupo III, seguido pelos NC (Não Classificados), em ambos os casos, isoladamente ou em associação. Research {{into the}} occurrence of S. aureus in the kitchen staffs of several hospitals was carried out. Samples were collected from the nasal vestibules of seventy eight people from eight hospitals in João Pessoa, Paraíba, Brazil. Tests for <b>phagetyping</b> and capacity for enterotoxin production were performed on the strains isolated. The agar Baird-Parker plaque technique was employed to isolate S. aureus incubated at 37 °C for 24 - 48 hours. The following techniques were used to identify the strains isolated: morphology, glucose fermentation/ oxidation and the production test for the following enzimes: catalase, coagulase, desoribonuclease (DNase) and thermonuclease (TNase). The celophane sac culture method was employed to verify the enterotoxigenic capacity of the S. aureus strains. Of {{the total number of}} people examined, thirty three (42. 3 %) were nasal carriers of S. aureus and enterotoxigenic strains were found in five (6. 4 %). Strains producing staphylococcal enterotoxin type B were found in two of these last, and in the other three, strains producing enterotoxins types C, AE and ABE, respectively. Fifty nine strains were submitted to <b>phagetyping</b> and fifty four strains (91. 5 %) were shown to be phage-typeable. There was found to be a predominance of strains lysed by phages of group III, followed by those of the "non classified" group, isolated or in association...|$|R
40|$|Virulence {{of three}} Canadian poultry strains of Salmonella enteritidis, namely <b>phagetypes</b> (PT) 4, 8 and 13, and one Salmonella heidelberg strain was {{assessed}} in orally and intraperitoneally inoculated one-day old chickens and {{compared to the}} virulence of a human S. enteritidis PT 4 strain from the United Kingdom (UK). The two PT 4 strains were also compared in orally inoculated adult laying hens. In addition, orally inoculated Balb/c mice were used to evaluate virulence of the above strains and two strains of Salmonella typhimurium containing different plasmids. In orally inoculated one-day old chickens, the UK S. enteritidis PT 4 strain was more virulent than the Canadian PT 4 strain. The UK PT 4 strain was also more virulent and invasive in adult laying hens than the Canadian PT 4 strain. The S. enteritidis PT 8 strain and one S. typhimurium strain isolated from a chicken hatchery were the most virulent for orally inoculated Balb/c mice.

40|$|Die Transkription in Plastiden höherer Pflanzen erfolgt durch die plastidärkodierte, bakterienähnliche RNA-Polymerase PEP und die kernkodierten Phagentyp-RNA-Polymerasen RpoTp und RpoTmp (NEP). Da für NEP bislang keine Transkriptionsfaktoren identifiziert wurden, wurden die entsprechenden Enzyme aus A. thaliana und N. tabacum mit verschiedenen, N-terminalen Epitopen in E. coli exprimiert und für {{pulldown}} assays zur Identifikation interagierender Proteine eingesetzt. Des Weiteren wurden Epitop-markierte Tabak RpoTp und Arabidopsis RpoTp und -Tmp in vivo exprimiert und zur Co-IP verwendet. In diesen Studien wurden als potentielle Interaktionspartner von RpoTp Ycf 1 und Ycf 2 gefunden. Des Weiteren konnte mit 3 xFLAG-RpoT-exprimierenden Arabidopsis-Mutanten gezeigt werden, dass RpoTp und -Tmp teilweise membranassoziiert sind. Außerdem wurde die duale Lokalisation der Arabidopsis RpoTmp in den Chloroplasten und Mitochondrien nachgewiesen. Mittels RIP-Chip wurden mit RpoTp assoziierte RNAs analysiert und mögliche, bisher unbekannte NEP-Transkripte gefunden. Plastidäre Haushaltsgene besitzen meist sowohl PEP- als auch NEP-Promotoren. Anhand transplastomischer Tabakpflanzen, in denen NEP-Promotoren von accD, rpoB und rrn 16 gegen einen PEP-Promotor ausgetauscht bzw. durch Mutagenese ausgeschaltet wurden, sollte die Arbeitsteilung von NEP und PEP in Abhängigkeit vom Entwicklungsstadium beleuchtet werden. Dabei wurde gezeigt, dass die Transkription durch PEP für accD zu einer leichten Überexpression, für rpoB hingegen zu einer verzögerten Entwicklung und verringerten Transkriptmengen führte. Zudem wurden durch RNA-Seq die Aktivierung zusätzlicher TSSs in den Mutanten gezeigt, welche die Effekte auf RNA- und Proteinebene erklärte, und der alternative Promotor PaccD- 158 identifiziert, welcher auch im Wildtyp genutzt wird. Es wird diskutiert, inwiefern die Rolle von NEP und PEP individuell für einzelne Gene in Abhängigkeit ihrer jeweiligen Funktion betrachtet werden muss. The transcription in plastids {{of higher}} plants {{is accomplished by}} the plastid encoded, bacterial-type RNA polymerase PEP and by the nuclear encoded, <b>phagetype</b> RNA polymerases RpoTp and RpoTmp (NEP). As the identification of transcription factors for NEP failed so far, in this work the corresponding enzymes from A. thaliana and N. tabacum containing different, N-terminally fused epitope tags were expressed in E. coli and used for pulldown assays to identify interacting proteins. Furthermore epitope-tagged tobacco RpoTp and Arabidopsis RpoTp and -Tmp were expressed in vivo and applied for co-immunoprecipitation. In these studies Ycf 1 and Ycf 2 were found as potential interaction partners of RpoTp. In addition, the 3 xFLAG-RpoT-expressing Arabidopsis mutants were used to show, that RpoTp and -Tmp are partly associated with the thylakoid membrane. Further, immunoblot assays confirmed the dual localization of the Arabidopsis RpoTmp in chloroplasts {{as well as in}} mitochondria. Moreover, via RIP-Chip analyses RNAs associated with RpoTp were analysed and potential new NEP transcripts were found. Most plastidial housekeeping genes possess PEP as well as NEP promoters. The division of labor between NEP and PEP according to the developmental stage was studied on the basis of transplastomic tobacco plants, in which NEP promoters of accD, rpoB and rrn 16 have been exchanged with a PEP promoter or knocked out by mutagenesis. It was shown, that transcription of accD by PEP lead to a slight overexpression, but PEP-dependent transcription of rpoB led to a delayed development and decreased transcript levels. Via RNA-seq an activation of additional TSSs could be shown in the mutants, which explains the effects on RNA and protein level, and the alternative promoter PaccD- 158 was identified, that is also used in the wildtype. It is discussed, how the roles and the division of labor of NEP and PEP should be considered individually for each gene according to its function...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of antimicrobial drug resistance during 1974 to 1995 {{of the three}} most common Salmonella serovars S. enteritidis, S. typhimurium and S. typhimurium O: 5 negative is described. In general the resistance rate for Salmonella is around 20 %, peaking with 40 % in 1990 when multiresistant S. typhimurium O: 5 negative DT 204 prevailed. In S. enteritidis the resistance rate is comparably low (In order to gain more information on resistance in S. enteritidis, the detailed phenotypic and genetic properties of 65 selected isolates were investigated by genetic and molecular techniques. It could be shown, that S. enteritidis isolates expressed resistance to antibiotics which are commonly used in veterinary medicine, namely tetracycline, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin and gentamicin. The resistance phenotypes {{turned out to be}} very stable and from the 65 investigated strains 50 % were monoresistant, and 27. 7 % of them exhibited resistance against tetracycline only. Another 50 % of the strains were multiresistant to 2 or more antimicrobial agents. 61 % of them were resistant against tetracycline and kanamycin. Mating experiments were carried out, in order to detect the presence of R-factors possessing transfer systems at 37 °C and 22 °C, reflecting conditions in two habitats that Salmonella serovars accounter during their life-cycle. High temperatures in the host and low in the environment. 83 % (54) of all investigated strains transferred one or more resistances under the mating conditions applied. The majority of 71 % (46) transferred at 37 °C and 12 % (8) of all strains transferred their resistances at 22 °C preferentially. In order to determine a clonal structure among the strains, further strain-differentiation was achieved by plasmid-profile-analysis and <b>phagetyping.</b> All isolates carried one or more plasmids and the whole population showed a very heterogeneous plasmid distribution. 69 % carried the virulence plasmid pRQ 29 and a 70 - 75 MD plasmid was present in 54 % of the strains. In conclusion the plasmid-profiling combined with the results of the antibiotic resistance tests and <b>phagetyping</b> elucidated a very heterogeneous population structure. The presence of clones was limited to only 6 strains. This contrasts the results obtained with other multiresistant serotypes e. g. the dominating multiresistant clone S. typhimurium DT 104. However, multiresistant S. enteritidis strains exist in Germany and selective pressure could facilitate their spread. This imposes the danger, that a mainly antibiotic sensitive S. enteritidis population might be substituted with resistant strains. Since 1991 there has been an increase in the rate of Nitrofurantoin-resistance in S. enteritidis from 0 % in 1990 to 35 % in 1995. 50 % of the S. enteritidis strains originated from poultry, and they showed a resistance level of 72 % against Nitrofurantoin. These strains appear to be epidemiologically related and might be derived from a clonal spread of a single ancestor. Nevertheless further molecular methods should be applied {{in order to determine the}} source of these nitrofurantoin resistant strains...|$|R

In total, 20 strains of the species Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica were selected for serotyping. 10 strains of Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) and 10 strains of Salmonella Typhimurium (STM) were selected for phage typing. In general, no problems were encountered with the typing of the O-antigens. 98 % of the NRLs and 98 % of the ENLs were able to correctly type the O-antigens. A few laboratories had problems typing the H-antigens. The H-antigens were typed correctly by 94 % of the NRLs and by 94 % of the ENLs. 93 % of the NRLs and 93 % of the ENLs indicated correct serovar names for the 20 serotyping strains.

40|$|Aims: Equine {{hospital}} Salmonella spp. {{were investigated}} retrospectively using antibiotic resistance typing and macro-restriction pulsed field gel electrophoresis techniques. Study Design: Retrospective study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Comparative Molecular Medicine and department of Animal and Population Health, School of Veterinary Science, University of Liverpool. Methodology: Twenty four achieved Salmonella isolates of equine faecal origin, previously collected from a UK equine hospital, were serotyped, <b>phagetyped</b> and tested both for antimicrobial susceptibility, by disc diffusion (BSAC) and for genetic relatedness by XbaI I-PFGE. Results: Most isolates were Salmonella typhimurium (n= 21), including five DT 104; two were Salmonella enteritidis, {{and one was}} untypeable. Sixteen isolates, including five Salmonella typhimurium DT 104 isolates exhibiting the classic penta-resistance phenotype (ACSSuT), were characterized as multidrug resistant (MDR). Fourteen MDR isolates showed additional resistance to florfenicol, although no resistance to ciprofloxacin was detected. MDR isolates showed two dominant resistance phenotypes: ACTSSuFlo (N= 8) resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, trimethoprim, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole and florfenicol and ACTTrSSuFlo (N= 6) which is also resistant to trimethoprim. Dendrogram analysis identified eleven distinct genetic groups showing an overall similarity of 84 %. The dominant resistance phenotypes were located mainly in two genetic groups: ACTSSuFlo isolates were all collected {{in the same year}} and were restricted to one clonal PFGE group showing > 99. 5 % genetic similarity; ACTTrSSuFlo isolates were genetically more diverse with 4 / 6 clustering in a closelyrelated group showing 94 % similarity. Conclusion: These findings suggest that although some Salmonella infections were introduced to the hospital from outside, infections spreading within the equine hospital could also be a reservoir of MDR Salmonella zoonotic infections and {{play a role in the}} development and dissemination of antibiotic resistance...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} the {{spatial and temporal}} variability of Salmonella enterica in urban and rural streams in a model watershed (Grand River watershed, Ontario, Canada), and examines the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and genetic diversity of various serotypes. Using a swab collection method and various media types, Salmonella were detected in 78. 4 % of samples between November 2003 and July 2005. A diverse range of Salmonella serotypes (n= 38) were isolated from water. Predominant serotypes and <b>phagetypes</b> (PT), including S. Typhimurium PT 104 and S. Heidelberg PT 19, {{and the proportion of}} isolates demonstrating AMR (33 %), was similar to those for humans and farm animals locally and across Canada, a trend not commonly reported. There was a greater diversity of serotypes and AMR profiles in isolates from the urban stream compared to the rural/agricultural streams. Plasmid-borne resistance was observed in 28. 6 % of AMR isolates, with two different plasmids responsible for resistance; the TEM- 1 plasmid (8. 1 Kb plasmids carrying blaTEM- 1, responsible for ampicillin resistance) and CMY- 2 plasmid (95. 5 Kb plasmids carrying blaCMY- 2, responsible for 3 rd generation cephalosporin resistance). CMY- 2 plasmids were only found in the urban stream and did not create a biological burden under non-selective conditions, indicating the long-term permanence of these plasmids. Seasonal differences in the overall diversity of serotypes and predominance of serotypes of human health significance (S. Typhimurium and S. Heidelberg) were observed. The lower occurrence of S. Typhimurium and S. Heidelberg in February and March was not the result of lower survival of these serotypes at low temperatures. Peaks in occurrence of S. Typhimurium and S. Heidelberg in the summer and spring, respectively, were pronounced in the rural/agricultural streams, as opposed to the urban stream. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and plasmid-typing revealed diversity within multiple drug resistant S. Typhimurium PT 104 isolates, indicating genetic differences among tributaries. The ubiquitous nature of Salmonella in water and the predominance of serotypes/phagetypes of human or veterinary health significance suggest that environmental exposure through consumption or contact with contaminated water is plausible. These streams may act as a vehicle for the dissemination of these organisms and their resistance genes between different hosts or environments...|$|R
