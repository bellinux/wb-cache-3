25|$|A {{few days}} after Comey's dismissal, the FBI {{reportedly}} widened its investigation to examine whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice. Many FBI insiders believed the real reason Comey was fired was because he had refused to end the investigation into Russian connections to the election. In his June testimony Comey said that Trump never asked him to stop the Russia investigation. The special counsel's office took over the investigation.

40|$|<b>Preliminary</b> design <b>information</b> is {{characteristically}} imprecise or fuzzy: speci cations {{and requirements}} {{are subject to}} change, and the design description is vague and incomplete. The Method of Imprecision uses the mathematics of fuzzy sets to explicitly represent and manipulate imprecise <b>preliminary</b> design <b>information,</b> enabling the designer {{to better understand the}} full range of designs and performances that satisfy an imprecise set of speci cations and requirements. This paper discusses the foundations of this methodology, and introduces pragmatic extensions that provide computationally tractable methods to map design imprecision from multiple design variables onto multiple performance variables. These methods attempt to minimize the number of function evaluations required while retaining an appropriate level of accuracy. This is achieved by using optimization to obtain extremal points for each performance variable and selectively applying a linear approximation for the mapping from the design variable space (DVS) to the performance variable space (PVS) to interpolate between extremal points. This linear approximation is constructed using regression techniques adapted from experiment design...|$|R

40|$|Every year, a {{great number}} of people die for {{bloodstream}} infections, especially by too late or inappropriate pharmacological treatment. The principal laboratory test for this type of infections is the blood culture; its limit is a turnaround time of about 96 hours. The aim of this work was to compare direct susceptibility testing with the automated VITEK 2 system. Fifty blood cultures, positive for Gram-negative bacteria, were processed for amikacin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefotaxime, meropenem and colistin with VITEK 2 and direct susceptibility testing by Kirby-Bauer or E-test methods. We found 93. 7 % correlation with 5. 0 % minor errors, 0. 5 % very major errors and 0. 8 % major errors. Piperacillin-tazobactam has shown the lowest percentage of correlation (79 %) and the highest percentage of errors (21 %). To conclude, direct susceptibility testing of positive blood cultures has shown promising results, rendering this method useful for giving to clinicians <b>preliminary</b> <b>informations</b> for therapy...|$|R

40|$|Imprecision is {{uncertainty}} that arises because of vague or incomplete <b>information.</b> <b>Preliminary</b> design <b>information</b> is characteristically imprecise: specifications and requirements {{are subject to}} change, and the design description is vague and incomplete. Yet many powerful evaluation tools, including finite element models, expect precisely specified data. Thus {{it is common for}} engineers to evaluate promising designs one by one. Alternatively, optimization may be used to search for the single "best" design. These approaches focus on individual, precisely specified points in the design space and provide limited information about the full range of acceptable designs. An alternative approach would be to evaluate sets of designs. The method of imprecision uses the mathematics of fuzzy sets in order to represent imprecision as preferences among designs:.
