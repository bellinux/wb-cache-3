5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Constitutional Law for the Vilayet of Bosnia was issued, Osman Pasha invited {{publishing}} magnate Ignjat Sopron to Sarajevo. Sopron was {{the owner and}} manager of a publishing and printing house in Zemun (then part of the Austrian Empire, today one of the municipalities of Belgrade, Serbia). An ethnic German, {{he was born in}} 1821 in Novi Sad as Ignaz Karl Soppron. Upon his arrival in Sarajevo, Osman Pasha offered him a subsidy to establish and organise a printing house. It was to be headquartered in a building on Sarajevo's Dugi sokak street that was being rented by the vilayet's government. Sopron soon came to the city bringing with him printing tools and materials, accompanied by a typesetter from Belgrade, Ilija Tomić. Tomić {{was in charge of the}} Cyrillic and Latin letters, and he engaged three graduated students of the Serb secondary school in Sarajevo to be his trainees. Osman Pasha also invited a man named Kadri-effendi from Istanbul to work as the typesetter for Arabic letters. The <b>principal</b> <b>aim</b> of the printing house was to issue an official gazette and to publish elementary school textbooks, thus stopping their import from Serbia and Austria.|$|E

25|$|Tilney {{occupied}} {{this position}} as it underwent {{a significant change}} in focus. When he began his work, it consisted principally of planning and conducting royal entertainments, as a unit of the Lord Chamberlain's office. His <b>principal</b> <b>aim</b> was that of pleasing the Queen. Then he started clearing up the various problems associated with the Revels office. It had fallen into major disrepute with creditors. A commission issued on 24 December 1581 solved this financial crisis and enabled him to reduce the maintenance costs of the office to a moderate budget. The second section of the commission was to prohibit the discussion of any controversial issues in theatre. A play would be permitted only if the manuscript had the signature of the Master. Any offender could be imprisoned by Tilney's orders. He was given complete authority in matters concerning drama. This responsibility had been previously shared by Revels officers.|$|E

25|$|Theorists of {{new media}} examine how {{emerging}} kinds of media, such as websites, blogs, wiki pages, and digital video, both delimit the ways people can use them, and provide new avenues {{for the production}} of social relations and meanings. Picking up from McLuhan, media theorists Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin , in their 1999 book Remediation: Understanding New Media, sought to describe how media forms interact with one another through remediation and the way that this media practice invokes the interrelated processes of immediacy and hypermediacy. The validation of the concept of ‘remediation’; “the representation of one medium in another” (p.45), is a <b>principal</b> <b>aim</b> of the book, in order to illustrate how remediation has been an integral practice to both new and old media forms that continually inform one another. Immediacy attempts to make viewers feel as if ‘really’ there, through hypermediated practices, which splice together (hybridizing as McLuhan would say) different kinds of media, such as the combination of “live-action footage with computer compositing and two- and three-dimensional computer graphics” (p.6) in order to create the appearance of a seamless moving image. These interrealated processes highlight, what Bolter and Grusin term, the “double logic of remediation” (p.5) that pursues the proliferation of media whilst trying to erase all traces of human and/or technological mediation.|$|E

500|$|Thirty years ago, when I first {{attempted}} {{to describe the}} characteristic features of tenth-century Anglo-Latin literature, I was rather naively bedazzled by the display of vocabulary which one encounters there. Because much of the vocabulary appeared to derive either from Aldhelm or from glossaries of the type called [...] "hermeneumata", I followed scholarly tradition and described the style as [...] "hermeneutic", {{on the assumption that}} the principal impulse behind the verbal display was that of dazzling the reader with arcane vocabulary exhumed from Greek-Latin glossaries and authors such as Aldhelm. I now suspect that the perception needs modification: that the authors' <b>principal</b> <b>aim</b> was not obfuscation, but was their (misguided, perhaps) attempt to reach in their prose a high stylistic register.|$|E
500|$|As {{one of his}} {{earliest}} actions as prince, Stephen broke into Poland to prevent Casimir IV from supporting Peter Aaron in 1458. This first military campaign [...] "established his credentials as a military commander of stature", according to historian Jonathan Eagles. However, he wanted to avoid prolonged conflict with Poland, because the recapture of Chilia was his <b>principal</b> <b>aim.</b> Chilia was an important port on the Danube that Peter III of Moldavia had surrendered to Hungary in 1448. He signed a treaty with Poland on the river Dniester on 4 April 1459. He acknowledged the suzerainty of Casimir IV and promised to support Poland against Tatar marauders. Casimir in turn pledged to protect Stephen against his enemies and to forbid Peter Aaron from returning to Moldavia. Peter Aaron subsequently left Poland for Hungary and settled in Székely Land, Transylvania.|$|E
500|$|The Vilayet Printing House (...) , {{originally}} named Sopron's Printing House (Сопронова печатња, Sopronova pečatnja), was {{the official}} printing {{house of the}} Ottoman Vilayet of Bosnia from April 1866 until the occupation of the province by Austria-Hungary in August 1878. It was the second printing house that operated in the territory of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, founded in Sarajevo almost 350 years after the Goražde printing house ceased its activity. Its founder was Ignjat Sopron, a publisher and printer from Zemun, who sold the establishment to the Government of the Vilayet of Bosnia in October 1866. Its foundation happened {{in the context of}} modernising and Europeanising Tanzimat reforms in the Ottoman Empire. Its <b>principal</b> <b>aim</b> was to issue an official gazette of the vilayet and publish textbooks for the elementary schools of Bosnian Serbs and Croats, thus stopping their import from the Principality of Serbia and the Austrian Empire.|$|E
