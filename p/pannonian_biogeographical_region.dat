This record confirms the further spreading of this invasive North American crayfish species into Slovakia. This finding is in harmony with other reports describing the fast spreading of this species in the Hungarian Plains of the <b>Pannonian</b> <b>Biogeographical</b> <b>Region.</b> During the same field trip the species was also detected at several localities nearby along the River Danube and Ipoly in Hungary...|$|E
40|$|Alkali {{marshes and}} {{wetlands}} {{are among the}} few natural open ecosystems in Central-Europe. Inland alkali marshes of the European steppe zone are typical only for the <b>Pannonian</b> <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region.</b> They are characterized by shallow water cover, high seasonal fluctuations in water availability and by considerable salt-content in water and soil. Even small changes in the above parameters can result in significant differences in habitat structure and species composition. Alkali marshes are usually characterised by a species-poor vegetation, characterised by a few bulrush species (Bolboschoenus maritimus, Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani and S. littoralis). As indicators of the alkali character of these wetlands several halophytes and salt-tolerant species {{are present in the}} vegetation, like Aster tripolium ssp. pannonicus, Atriplex littoralis, Chenopodium chenopodioides and Plantago maritima. In sites with moderate salinity Phragmites australis, Schoenoplectus lacustris and Typha spp. can reach high cover scores. Several Pannonian endemic species are also present in alkali wetlands, like Cirsium brachycephalum, Acorellus pannonicus and Puccinellia limosa. Due to the uneve...|$|E
40|$|The {{emerging}} {{field of}} soundscape ecology views ecosystems {{in terms of}} biophony, geophony and anthrophony. Soundscape ecology considers the effects of sound on fauna, and this research focuses on anuran breeding lek soundscapes. The sensitivity of anuran breeding leks to acoustic disturbances makes breeding leks an important venue for a comparative soundscape study. We made long-tend (> 24 h) sound recordings in three representative wetlands and short-term (< 30 min) recordings in ten sites in the <b>Pannonian</b> <b>Biogeographical</b> <b>Region</b> of Hungary and around the Hungary and Slovakia border. Long-term soundscapes of the floodplain stretch, where there is relatively minor anthrophonical disturbance, showed an obvious circadian change in sound intensities. The site with moderate sound contamination exhibited a distdrbed pattern of circadian sound variation, while the site with heavy traffic noise displayed an apparently random temporal soundscape. At different amphibian breeding sites during mating season, our short-term recordings were dominated by anuran calls, bird songs and wind noises, while insect calls and rain were present to a lesser degree. Our study indicates that vehicle traffic noise is a severe imposition to the natural soundscape, and suggests that soundscape monitoring can provide a reliable and sensitive index of environmental change for both short-term and long-term periods...|$|E

This study compares the effects of biogeography and ecology to determine the plant diversity of European forests using a representative sample of 3100 plots all over Europe (BIOSOIL project). The general aim is to compare the effects of ecology and management with respect to biogeography. Total plant diversity was divided into different spatial components: plot, site, forest type (a proxy for ecological factors) and <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region.</b> Three hypotheses were tested: H 1 : The diversity accounted by the <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region</b> is higher that the diversity accounted by the lower scale components; H 2 : Beta nestedness is higher within than across <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions,</b> while Beta complementarity is lower within than across <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> (after correction for extent). H 3 : Distance decay rate across <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> is higher than distance decay rate within <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> (after correction for extent). The results are used to understand how the different factors contribute to determine the forest plant diversity patterns and to get indication for future forest management...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of {{the effect}} of habitat type and region on diet and feeding {{behaviours}} of a species facilitates a better understanding of factors impacting populations, which contributes to effective conservation management. Using spraint analysis and relative frequency of occurrence data from the literature, we described the dietary patterns of Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) in 23 study sites within the <b>Pannonian</b> <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region</b> in Hungary. Our results indicated that diet composition varied by habitat type and is therefore context dependant. The differences among habitat types were however lower than expected. We noticed a decline in the fish consumption with a concomitant increase in trophic niche breadth and amphibian consumption in rivers, ponds (fish farms), backwaters, marshes and small watercourses. The main differences in diet were not attributed to the consumption of primary and secondary food types (fish and amphibians), but rather to differences in other, less important food types (mammals, birds). Using hierarchical cluster analysis, rivers and ponds could clearly be separated from other habitat types. We found the main fish diet of otters in most of these areas consisted of small (< 100 g), eurytopic, littoral and non-native, mostly invasive species. Dietary studies from 91 sites in six European biogeographical regions showed that fish are consumed most frequently in the Atlantic and Boreal, less in the Continental and Pannonian, and least in the Alpine and Mediterranean regions. Comparative analysis indicated that the Mediterranean region (with frequent crayfish consumption) and Alpine region (frequent amphibian consumption) cluster separate from the other regions.

40|$|The European Union {{is at the}} {{threshold}} of a new development period. Hungary as a Member State of the EU was given an opportunity to frame its comprehensive development programs for the next seven years (2007 - 2013). One of these programs is the Transport Operative Program, which focuses on large-scale, large-volume national trans¬port infrastructure developments including road, air, inland water, rail, and combined transport. The Program cover a defined period, however, it will assign the direction of developments for a longer time and foreshadow the vision of the whole transport system in future. Under the related EU legislation a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) must be accomplished for these kinds of programs. SEA is a specific procedure to identify and control environmentally harmful processes at the earliest and highest level of planning. SEA covers all fields of environmental issues including wildlife conservation and biodiversity maintenance. In the course of the present research we examined the opportunities the SEA’s institutionalized framework (regulations as well as measures) offers or might offer to mitigate the direct and indirect impacts of transportation via the nascent Hungarian Transport Operative Program. The half-year-long study conducted between June and December, 2006 primarily aims at exploring opportunities lying in strategic-level assessment to conserve biodiversity at national and regional level and to treat habitat fragmentation [...] Our study focused on determining what are the main issues that can be handled by the SEA and which ecological conflicts can be – at least partly - resolved at this level. During the course of the research we used experience gathered by older EU Member States like the UK, Italy and Spain that have been formulated in the form of guidelines. The significance of our research is strengthened by fact that the overwhelming majority of one out of the nine European eco-regions (called <b>Pannonian</b> <b>Biogeographical</b> <b>Region)</b> can be found in Hungary. It is a great challenge for the country to meet Europe’s controversial expectations: how to conserve this valuable area {{but at the same time}} carry out a large transport infrastructural development. The results gained suggest that SEA is a satisfactory tool to indicate large-scale harmful processes, however, it does not guarantee certain and sizable mitigation of effects unless the its methodology will be developed further and it will be integrated more efficiently in the implementation process of the transportation strategies in future...|$|E

40|$|Background: Italian forests {{contains}} a high total diversity of plants species {{and this is}} likely due to the huge biogeographical gradients covered by the country (from the Alps to the Mediterranean) {{as well as to}} the long lasting human exploitation and management practices. This study aims to investigate the interactive effects of ecology and biogeography in determining the total plant diversity of Italian forests using a spatially representative sample of forests made of 201 plots sampled all over the country (CONECOFOR LI network). The general hypothesis to be tested is that the effects of present day ecological factors are less important than biogeographical factors in determining the total diversity of forested areas. The plant diversity of the sampled forest plan communities was divided into different spatial components, in particular: plot, site, forest type (used as a proxy for present day ecological conditions) and <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region.</b> Species presence absence was only used. The three following hypotheses have then been tested: Hypothesis 1 : The diversity component accounted by the <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region</b> is higher that the diversity accounted by the lower scale components (plot, site, forest type). Hypothesis 2 : Distance decay rate across <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> is higher than distance decay rate within <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> (after correction for extent). Hypothesis 3 : Beta nestedness is higher within than across <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> (after correction for extent); on the other hand Beta complementarity is lower within than across <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> (after correction for extent).

40|$|Aim: Climbing plants (lianas, vines, scramblers) are {{under-represented}} in many global datasets that underpin {{knowledge in}} functional trait biology, important for ecological theory, conservation and predicting forest dynamics under global change. To address this omission, we tested {{a set of}} hypotheses about how the traits of climbers vary with latitude and climate and amongst major <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> of the world using a comprehensive new, global dataset. Location: Global. Methods: Data on seed mass, leaf size, specific leaf area, climbing mechanism, dispersal mode, and growth habit were compiled for 1092 species in 34 countries. For each trait we: (1) quantified the strength of latitudinal gradients using analyses across species and across evolutionary divergences, (2) examined underlying relationships between trait variation and climate variables, (3) tested for phylogenetic signal in traits (the tendency for closely related species to exhibit similar traits), and (4) compared trait variation and phylogenetic clustering between four major <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> of the world (Africa, the Americas, Asia and Australasia). Results: We found highly significant relationships between latitude and four traits (growth habit, leaf size, seed mass and specific leaf area, SLA). Leaf size, seed mass and SLA also showed significant relationships with mean annual temperature and precipitation. However, no relationship was found between dispersal mode and latitude or between climbing mechanism and latitude. These results were largely consistent in cross-species and phylogenetic analyses. All traits, except seed mass, exhibited clear differences between <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions.</b> SLA and seed mass {{were the only two}} traits that did not present a significant phylogenetic signal. Phylogenetic clustering was detected in species from the Americas and Africa, indicating that trait conservatism is important in broad <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions.</b> Main conclusions: The functional traits and phylogenetic patterns of climbers differ between <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions,</b> and from other better-studied plant growth forms. Species-level trait differences may hold the key to understanding why climbers are increasing in abundance in some regions of the world, but not in others. 15 page(s...|$|R
