50|$|Tube bending as {{a process}} starts with loading a tube into a tube or <b>pipe</b> <b>bender</b> and {{clamping}} it into place between two dies, the clamping block and the forming die. The tube is also loosely held by two other dies, the wiper die and the pressure die.|$|E
50|$|Gardner Bender is a {{manufacturer}} of professional electricians' tools and supplies. The company has a long history, starting as the brainchild of Jim Gardner, a master mechanic in a Milwaukee aluminum can plant who spent his free time as an inventor. In 1959, after watching the electricians at the plant struggle with an inferior device, Gardner invented an aluminum <b>pipe</b> <b>bender</b> so promising {{that he decided to}} manufacture it himself. Today, Gardner Bender manufactures electrical tools, voltage testers, wire management products and other professional equipment.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{proposes a}} computation approach {{to address the}} evaluation of end product machining accuracy in elliptical surfaced helical pipe bending using 6 dof parallel manipulator as a <b>pipe</b> <b>bender.</b> The target end product is wearable metal muscle supporters used in build-to-order welfare product manufacturing. This paper proposes a product testing model that mainly corrects the surface direction estimation errors of existing least squares ellipse fittings, followed by arc length and central angle evaluations. This post-machining modelling requires combination of reverse rotations and translations to a specific location before accuracy evaluation takes place, i. e. the reverse comparing to pre-machining product modelling. This specific location not only allows us to compute surface direction but also the amount of excessive surface twisting as a rotation angle about a specified axis, i. e. quantification of surface torsion. At first we experimented three ellipse fitting methods such as, two least-squares fitting methods with Bookstein constraint and Trace constraint, and one non- linear least squares method using Gauss-Newton algorithm. From fitting results, we found that using Trace constraint is more reliable and designed a correction filter for surface torsion observation. Finally we apply 2 D total least squares line fitting method with a rectification filter for surface direction detection...|$|E

5000|$|Generally, {{round stock}} {{is what is}} used in tube bending. However, square and {{rectangular}} tubes and pipes may also be bent to meet job specifications. Other factors involved in the tube bending process is the wall thickness, tooling and lubricants needed by the <b>pipe</b> and tube <b>bender</b> to best shape the material {{and it is also}} used in different ways e.g.( [...] tube,pipe wires).|$|R
