The trader selling a put {{has an obligation to}} buy the stock from the put buyer at a fixed price ("strike price").

50|$|Most {{parallel}} {{programs can}} run sequentially but {{will benefit from}} parallelism when it is present. It is possible to design programs that require parallelism for correct behavior. Algorithms such as producer-consumer that are implemented so as to require two or more threads are one example of requiring concurrency to work properly. For instance, consider a bounded container with a capacity for only three items and a program which has one thread doing “PUT <b>PUT</b> <b>PUT</b> PUT,” and another thread doing “GET GET GET GET,” each doing their actions only four at a time. Such a program requires interleaving (concurrency). A program that requires concurrency {{is more difficult to}} debug. It is easier to debug a program that has a valid sequential execution.|$|E

40|$|Options {{are one of}} {{the form}} of {{investment}} which a contract that gives the right (not obligation) to the option holder to buy (call options) or sell (<b>put</b> options) the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price. Option price {{is a reflection of the}} intrinsic value of the option and any additional amount over intrinsic value. One type of options that are traded is compound options. Compound option model is introduced by Robert Geske in 1979. Compound options are options on options.

Expression of the GDH 1, <b>PUT</b> 1, <b>PUT</b> 2, and <b>PUT</b> 4 genes also responded to DAL 80 disruption, but much more modestly. Expression of GLN 1 and GDH 2 exhibited parallel responses to the provision of asparagine and glutamine as nitrogen sources but did not follow the regulatory responses noted above for the nitrogen catabolic genes such as DAL 5. Steady-state mRNA levels of both genes did not significantly decrease when glutamine was provided as nitrogen source but were lowered by the provision of asparagine.

Diagonal movement creates added space to maneuver, compared to simply running straight ahead or laterally. It also means that players must be willing to switch positions as the situation demands.|$|R
