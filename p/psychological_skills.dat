40|$|Previous {{research}} has highlighted {{the importance of}} relationships (e. g., athletic therapist/client) and <b>psychological</b> <b>skill</b> use to manage negative emotions (e. g., frustration, anger) {{in order to obtain}} optimal adherence and injury rehabilitation outcomes. However, the relationship between student athletic therapists and varsity athletes has not been examined. Thus, the objective was {{to examine the relationship between}} student therapists and varsity athletes and <b>psychological</b> <b>skill</b> use in injury rehabilitation in relation to adherence. Two senior student therapists and three varsity athletes who had completed injury rehabilitation were recruited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Both groups of participants described the role of the student therapists as being primarily focused on injury prevention and management. Furthermore, the peer relationships that developed were valued. Goal-setting was used in injury rehabilitation to guide progress, improve adherence, and frame injuries as temporary setbacks. Participants were familiar with imagery from use in other context, however did not report using it in injury rehabilitation. Finally, participants acknowledged that adherence was not perfect, but acknowledged the peer relationships and collaborative goal-setting as helpful. These findings highlight the importance of the relationship between student therapists and athletes and suggest these relationships may support athlete adherence...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study examined: (a) whether athletes’ {{goal orientations}} differ across {{training}} and competition; (b) whether goal orientations predict effort, enjoyment, and <b>psychological</b> <b>skill</b> use differently {{in training and}} competition; and (c) whether goal orientations predict perceived improvement in training and perceived performance in competition. Method: Participants were 116 competitive tennis players (mean age = 19. 99, SD = 5. 82), who completed questionnaires measuring goal orientations, effort, enjoyment, and <b>psychological</b> <b>skill</b> use in training and competition, perceived improvement in training, and perceived performance in competition. Results: Dependent t-tests revealed that athletes reported higher task orientation in training than in competition and higher ego orientation in competition than in training, while Pearson product-moment correlations revealed a high cross-contextual consistency for both task and ego goal orientations between training and competition. Regression analyses indicated that task orientation predicted positively effort, enjoyment, self-talk, and goal setting in both contexts, perceived improvement in training, and perceived performance in competition. An interaction effect also emerged whereby ego orientation predicted positively effort in competition only when task orientation was low or average. Conclusions: The findings suggest that goal orientations may differ between training and competition; task orientation is the goal that should be promoted in both contexts; and the context may affect the relationship between goal orientations and effort, enjoyment, and goal setting...|$|R
40|$|Long {{distance}} {{running is}} a moderate to high-power activity supported by aerobic energy (Ward-Smith, 1999). Apart from {{the importance of}} aerobic conditioning, long distance running requires {{a great deal of}} mental toughness. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare talented, with less talented distance runners, in order to identify the psychological characteristics exhibited by talented distance runners. A cross-sectional study design was used which consisted of 182 grade 8 pupils: 87 boys and 95 girls. Sport <b>psychological</b> <b>skill</b> levels were measured with the Athletic Copings Skills Inventory (ACSI- 28). The Australian Talent Search Protocol was used to identify general sporting talent. The results of the beep test were used to identify the most talented potential distance runners. The top 30 % (n= 58) of the adolescents were assigned to group 1 (talented group) and the remaining adolescents to group 2 (n= 107) (less talented). The results revealed that the talented group obtained significantly better results in 6 of the 8 variables which included adversity, pressure, goal-setting, concentration, coachability and the average coping ability (p< 0. 05). Moderate practical significance was found in 7 of the 8 variables which included adversity, pressure, goal-setting, concentration, confidence, coachability and coping ability, and a small practical significance was indicated for worry. It is therefore, important to consider <b>psychological</b> <b>skill</b> development in young long distance athletes to enhance their athletic performance. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of sports mental {{training}} (SMT) focused on technical coaches. In case 1, a SMT was performed on a high school baseball team by a technical coach of baseball team. A content of the training was a basic <b>psychological</b> <b>skill</b> like the goal setting. Levels of psychological competitive ability were assessed by the Diagnostic Inventory of Psychological-Competitive Ability for Athletes (DIPCA) before and after the training. As a result, the training improved the confidence and strategy ability of the baseball players. These findings suggested that combination of the SMT and the practice for technical skills was effective for the confidence and strategy ability. In case 2, we assessed effects of a SMT for a high school volleyball team and its technical coach. As a direct approach method, the SMT was performed on all the players by a SMT coach once a month. Moreover, as an indirect approach method, the SMT was performed on the technical coach by the SMT coach everyday. As a result, the team was 3 rd place in Kinki competition tournament. A style of coaching in the technical coach was changed. Although a next goal had been lost when losing a match before the training, the technical coach set the goal of the team again, aiming at the Kinki competition tournament.

5000|$|Self-talk {{refers to}} the {{thoughts}} and words athletes and performers say to themselves, usually in their minds. Self-talk phrases (or cues) are used to direct attention towards a particular thing {{in order to improve}} focus or are used alongside other techniques to facilitate their effectiveness. [...] For example, a softball player may think [...] "release point" [...] when at bat to direct her attention {{to the point where the}} pitcher releases the ball, while a golfer may say [...] "smooth stroke" [...] before putting to stay relaxed. Research suggests either positive or negative self-talk may improve performance, suggesting the effectiveness of self-talk phrases depends on how the phrase is interpreted by the individual. However, the use of positive self-talk is considered to be more efficacious and is consistent with the associative network theory of Gordon Bower and the self-efficacy tenet within the broader Social Cognitive Theory of Albert Bandura. The use of words in sport has been widely utilized. The ability to bombard the unconscious mind with one single positive phrase, is one of the most effective and easy to use <b>psychological</b> <b>skills</b> available to any athlete.|$|E
5000|$|The Russian {{terrorist}} group Anarchy 99 has a biochemical weapon named [...] "Silent Night", missing {{since the fall}} of the Soviet Union, and any attempts the NSA has made to get information on the group and the weapon have failed. Its latest mission to collect information goes awry when its agent's identity is discovered, and the agent assassinated. NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons points out the reason for the failed attempts: Anarchy 99 are mercenaries who have formal training as Russian soldiers and can recognize any agent with ties to the United States government, or formal training in the military. Gibbons believes {{the only way to get}} close to Anarchy 99 without their suspecting something wrong is to recruit an agent who can blend in and gather information without their knowledge. He selects Xander Cage, also known as X, an extreme sports professional and host of his own television show, who was recently captured by the FBI for stealing and destroying a prominent California senator's car as an act of protest. Gibbons puts Cage through two tests [...] - [...] stopping a staged diner robbery and escaping from a drug cartel's plantation in Colombia during an army raid. Each test allows Cage to demonstrate both his physical and his <b>psychological</b> <b>skills,</b> as he defeats his foes and rapidly assesses the situation before him. Satisfied with how Cage performs, Gibbons offers him the mission, and convinces Cage to accept it by using a carrot/stick technique, with a clean slate as the carrot and a prison sentence as the stick.|$|E
