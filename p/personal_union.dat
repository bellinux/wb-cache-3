5|$|Following {{the death}} of Elizabeth I in 1603, the throne of England was {{inherited}} by the Scottish House of Stuart, resulting in the Union of the Crowns: the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland were united in a <b>personal</b> <b>union</b> under James VI and I. As a consequence, the Royal Arms of England and Scotland were combined in the king's new personal arms. Nevertheless, although referencing the <b>personal</b> <b>union</b> with Scotland and Ireland, the Royal Arms of England remained distinct from the Royal Arms of Scotland, until the two realms were joined in a political union in 1707, leading to a unified Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{divisions}} {{have changed}} over time, reflecting: territorial losses to Ottoman conquest and subsequent Croatian recapture of some territory; changes in the political status of Dalmatia, Dubrovnik and Istria; and political circumstances, including the <b>personal</b> <b>union</b> and settlement between Croatia and Hungary.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Rome, which ruled the area of modern-day Slavonia until the 5th century, Ostrogoths and Lombards {{controlled}} the area {{before the arrival of}} Avars and Slavs, when the Principality of Lower Pannonia was established in the 7th century. It was later incorporated into the Kingdom of Croatia and, after its decline, the kingdom was ruled through a <b>personal</b> <b>union</b> with Hungary.|$|E
50|$|Sweden has for {{political}} and dynastic reasons been in union with other kingdoms and princely states, ostensibly <b>personal</b> <b>unions.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{style of}} the Dutch {{sovereign}} has changed many times since {{the establishment of the}} Kingdom of the Netherlands due to formations and dissolutions of <b>personal</b> <b>unions,</b> as well as due to marriages of female sovereigns and cognatic successions.|$|R
25|$|After Italy {{occupied}} Albania {{and prepared}} {{an attack on}} Yugoslavia, Ciano invited Pavelić to negotiations. They discussed Croatian armed revolt, Italian military intervention {{and the creation of}} a Croatian state with monetary, customs and <b>personal</b> <b>unions</b> with Italy, which Pavelić later refused.|$|R
5|$|For much of Ernest's reign, {{the heir}} {{presumptive}} to Saxe-Coburg and Gotha {{was his only}} sibling Prince Albert, consort of Queen Victoria. When it became increasingly more clear that Ernest would be childless, {{the possibility of a}} <b>personal</b> <b>union</b> between his duchies and the United Kingdom became real, a reality that was deemed undesirable. Special arrangements were made by a combination of constitutional clauses and renunciations to pass Ernest's throne to a son of Albert while preventing a <b>personal</b> <b>union.</b> Consequently, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, his brother's second eldest son, was designated the childless Ernest's heir presumptive on 14 December 1861, when his older brother the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII of the United Kingdom) renounced his succession rights.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 12th century, {{and after the}} decay of the native Croatian royal family of Trpimirović, the castle of Klis was mainly governed by Croatian nobility, under the {{supremacy}} of Hungarian kings. The Kingdom of Croatia and the Kingdom of Hungary were, from 1102, in a <b>personal</b> <b>union</b> of two kingdoms, united under the Hungarian king.|$|E
5|$|After Anne's accession, {{the problem}} of the {{succession}} re-emerged. The Scottish Parliament, infuriated that the English Parliament did not consult them on the choice of Sophia's family as the next heirs, passed the Act of Security 1704, threatening to end the <b>personal</b> <b>union</b> between England and Scotland. The Parliament of England retaliated with the Alien Act 1705, threatening to devastate the Scottish economy by restricting trade. The Scottish and English parliaments negotiated the Acts of Union 1707, under which England and Scotland were united into a single Kingdom of Great Britain, with succession under the rules prescribed by the Act of Settlement.|$|E
50|$|The Kalmar Union is a historiographical term {{meaning a}} series of <b>personal</b> <b>unions</b> that united the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway (with Iceland, Greenland, Faroe Islands, Shetland, and Orkney), and Sweden (including Finland) under a single monarch, though {{intermittently}} and with a population less than 3,000,000.|$|R
50|$|The kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, Sweden {{and their}} then territories were all united in the Kalmar Union under Margaret I on June 17, 1397. A series of <b>personal</b> <b>unions</b> kept it alive {{up until the}} {{election}} of Gustav Vasa as king of Sweden in 1523, {{which led to a}} de facto split.|$|R
50|$|The Kalmar Union (Danish/Norwegian/Swedish: Kalmarunionen) was {{a series}} of <b>personal</b> <b>unions</b> (1397-1520) that united the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway and Sweden under a single monarch. The {{countries}} had given up their sovereignty but not their independence, and diverging interests (especially Swedish dissatisfaction over the Danish and Holsteinish dominance) gave rise to a conflict that would hamper it from the 1430s until its final dissolution in 1523.|$|R
5|$|By the 1860s, {{failure of}} the policy became apparent, leading to the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and {{creation}} of a <b>personal</b> <b>union</b> between the crowns of the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary. The treaty left the issue of Croatia's status to Hungary, and the status was resolved by the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement of 1868, when kingdoms of Croatia and Slavonia were united. The Kingdom of Dalmatia remained under de facto Austrian control, while Rijeka retained the status of Corpus separatum introduced in 1779.|$|E
5|$|During an {{excursion}} into Przemysl Land in the 48th {{year of his}} reign, Władysław cought a cold {{from which}} {{he was unable to}} recover. He finally died in Grodek in 1434, leaving Poland to his elder son, Władysław III, and Lithuania to his younger, Casimir, both still minors at the time. The Lithuanian inheritance, however, could not be taken for granted. Władysław's death ended the <b>personal</b> <b>union</b> between the two realms, and it was not clear what would take its place.|$|E
5|$|From 1814 he {{supported}} the Russian Empire, seen as a Pan-Slavist ally of Poland, and favored {{the idea of a}} great Slavic monarchy. After the fall of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1815, he {{became a member of the}} government of the newly created small state of Congress Poland (in <b>personal</b> <b>union</b> with Russia), initially in the new Ministry of Education and Religion, in 1816 serving as deputy minister. In 1815 he was decorated with the Order of Saint Stanislaus. In 1819 he endorsed a controversial censorship law, damaging his reputation.|$|E
5000|$|When King Gustav Vasa broke Sweden {{free from}} the Kalmar Union (a series of <b>personal</b> <b>unions</b> between Denmark, Sweden and Norway since 1397) and made Sweden {{independent}} again, Tre Kronor Castle became his most important royal seat. Gustav Vasa expanded the castle's defensive measures, while his son John III of Sweden later rebuilt and improved the castle aesthetically, {{turning it into a}} renaissance style castle and adding a castle church.|$|R
50|$|Diplomacy {{is rather}} detailed: royal marriages, insults, alliances, trade embargoes, {{and so on}} all affect {{relations}} between countries. Players are able to gain control over other countries peacefully through <b>personal</b> <b>unions</b> and vassalage. Early international {{institutions such as the}} Holy Roman Empire, the Papal Curia and with the Divine Wind expansion the Shogunate are simulated in some depth. Every country has its own culture and religion, a frequent source of diplomatic unity or friction.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of <b>personal</b> <b>unions,</b> one king has often {{have more than one}} ordinal, because he has had {{different}} ordinals in the different realms where he reigns. For instance, Charles XV of Sweden was also king of Norway, but in Norway he went under the name Charles IV. The Swedish-Norwegian union was in force 1814-1905 and both realms had had kings called Charles before the union, but Sweden had had many more kings by that name.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the Norwegian state was {{severely}} weakened. In 1389 Norway {{entered into a}} <b>personal</b> <b>union</b> with Denmark and Sweden in the Kalmar Union. As the kings resided in Denmark, Norway was gradually reduced to a provincial status, and after the Reformation most of its separate institutions were abolished. The Danish government in Copenhagen regarded Norway as a backward province to be exploited, but not worthy of investment in monumental architecture. Hence, ambitious Renaissance architecture is unusual in Norway compared to other European countries.|$|E
5|$|In the {{meantime}} Sigismund also arrived and was crowned in Kraków, which initiated his {{long in the}} Commonwealth (1587–1632) reign as Zygmunt III Waza. The prospect of a <b>personal</b> <b>union</b> with Sweden raised for the Polish and Lithuanian ruling circles political and economic hopes, including favorable Baltic trade conditions and a common front against Russia's expansion. However concerning the latter, the control of Estonia had soon become the bone of contention. Sigismund's ultra-Catholicism appeared threatening to the Swedish Protestant establishment and contributed to his dethronement in Sweden in 1599.|$|E
5|$|James VI and I (James Charles Stuart; 19 June 1566– 27 March 1625) was King of Scotland as James VI from 24 July 1567 and King of England and Ireland as James I {{from the}} union of the Scottish and English crowns on 24 March 1603 {{until his death in}} 1625. The kingdoms of Scotland and England were {{individual}} sovereign states, with their own parliaments, judiciary, and laws, though both were ruled by James in <b>personal</b> <b>union.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Spanish and Austrian hegemony was {{not always}} based on direct rule; states such as Venice, Genoa, the Papal States, the duchies of Este, and Duchy of Savoy, were the only {{independent}} states, while {{a large part of}} the rest of Italy relied on the protection of Spain or Austria against external aggression. Furthermore, those areas under direct Spanish and (later) Austrian control were theoretically independent principalities bound to the Spanish and Austrian empires through <b>personal</b> <b>unions</b> alone.|$|R

5|$|Luxembourg {{has been}} an {{independent}} grand duchy since 9 June 1815. Originally, Luxembourg was in <b>personal</b> <b>union</b> with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of the Netherlands from 16 March 1815 until 23 November 1890. While Wilhelmina succeeded Willem III in the Netherlands, this was not possible in Luxembourg due {{to the order of}} succession being based on Salic law at that time; he was succeeded instead by Adolphe. In a referendum held on 28 September 1919, 80.34 per cent voted in favor of keeping the monarchy. The current monarch is Henri.|$|E
5|$|Nobel's {{instructions}} named a Norwegian Nobel Committee {{to award}} the Peace Prize, {{the members of}} whom were appointed shortly after the will was approved in April 1897. Soon thereafter, the other prize-awarding organisations were designated or established. These were Karolinska Institutet on 7 June, the Swedish Academy on 9 June, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June. The Nobel Foundation reached an agreement on guidelines for how the prizes should be awarded; and, in 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II. In 1905, the <b>personal</b> <b>union</b> between Sweden and Norway was dissolved.|$|E
5|$|Partitions of Poland {{at the end}} of the 18th century {{brought an}} end to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna {{established}} a semi-independent Kingdom of Poland (known as Congress Kingdom) under control of and in <b>personal</b> <b>union</b> with the Russian Empire. The King (Tsar) of Poland at that time used a white royal banner emblazoned with the arms of the Congress Kingdoma black double-headed Russian eagle with the Polish White Eagle in an inescutcheon.|$|E

5|$|John VI died in Lisbon in 1826. His elder son Peter, who had {{declared}} {{the independence of}} Brazil in 1822, becoming Emperor Peter I, succeeded to the Portuguese throne as Peter IV. Because the new Brazilian constitution did not allow further <b>personal</b> <b>unions</b> of Portugal and Brazil, Peter abdicated the Portuguese crown in favour of his elder daughter Maria da Glória, who became Maria II of Portugal. She was only seven years old, so Peter stated she would marry his brother Miguel who would act as regent. However, in 1828, Miguel deposed Maria and proclaimed himself king, abolishing the 1822 liberal constitution and ruling as an absolute monarch. This started {{the period of the}} Liberal Wars.|$|R
5|$|Sigismund II's childlessness added {{urgency to}} the idea of turning the <b>personal</b> <b>union</b> between Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into a more {{permanent}} and tighter relationship; it was also a priority for the execution movement. Lithuania's laws were codified and reforms enacted in 1529, 1557, 1565–1566 and 1588, gradually making its social, legal and economic system similar to that of Poland, with the expanding role of the middle and lower nobility. Fighting wars with Moscow under Ivan IV and the threat perceived from that direction provided additional motivation for the real union for both Poland and Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|The Napoleonic Wars {{led to the}} {{separation}} of Norway and Denmark. Norway was restored in 1814 as an autonomous kingdom in a <b>personal</b> <b>union</b> with Sweden. The two states had separate institutions, except for the king and the foreign service. Regained statehood required new public buildings, mainly {{in the capital of}} Christiania. During the following century, the country experienced an impressive growth in wealth and population, resulting in a need for new infrastructure and buildings.|$|E
5|$|The decisive {{battle between}} the two {{candidates}} was won by Stephen Báthory at Sânpaul on July 8, 1575. In the same year, he was elected king of Poland, thus a <b>personal</b> <b>union</b> was formed {{between the two countries}} that lasted until his death in 1586. He left the administration of the principality first to his brother, Christopher Báthory (15751581), and then to his brother's minor son, Sigismund Báthory (15811602), bestowing on them the title of voivode, while he himself took the title of prince.|$|E
5000|$|The szlachta ( [...] , exonym: Nobility) was {{a legally}} privileged noble {{class in the}} Kingdom of Poland, Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia, Samogitia (both after Union of Lublin became a single state, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) and the Zaporozhian Host. It {{originated}} and gained considerable institutional privileges between 1333 and 1370 in Kingdom of Poland {{during the reign of}} King Casimir III the Great. In 1413, following a series of tentative <b>personal</b> <b>unions</b> between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crown Kingdom of Poland, the existing Lithuanian-Ruthenian nobility formally joined this class. As the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569-1795) evolved and expanded in territory, its membership grew to include the leaders of Ducal Prussia and Livonia.|$|R
50|$|D'Oisy {{was born}} in Valenciennes. Sources {{occasionally}} call him French or a Frenchman, or {{say that he was}} from Hainaut, which is currently a province in the Walloon Region of Belgium. His birthplace, now in the département Nord in France, was in the County of Hainaut and had belonged to the Holy Roman Empire, though since 1285 it had used French currency. In Jean d'Oisy's lifetime, the county formed <b>personal</b> <b>unions</b> with the County of Holland (1299-1436) and with Bavaria-Straubing (1356-1417). As from at most 26 years of age onwards, he lived in the Duchy of Brabant and for his works applied the style that became named after that area; he may be regarded as a Brabantian architect. He died in Brussels.|$|R
50|$|He {{became the}} Prince of Shenyang, a new title, in 1307 or 1308. After his father's death in 1308, King Chungseon {{was obliged to}} return to the throne of Goryeo and made efforts to reform court politics, but spent as much time as {{possible}} in China. The title King of Shenyang was renamed Prince of Shen in 1310. He is a very rare case of <b>personal</b> <b>unions</b> in East Asia. He retired from the throne in 1313, and was replaced by King Chungsuk of Goryeo. King Chungseon was briefly sent into exile in Tibet (lately Sakya) after the death of the emperor Renzong of Yuan (元仁宗) but was permitted soon thereafter to return to Beijing, where he died in 1325.|$|R
