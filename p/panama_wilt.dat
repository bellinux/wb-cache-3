40|$|Due to {{unbalanced}} nutrition, {{the disease}} incidence and economic loss {{due to them}} is increasing in India. Hence the profitability of some horticultural crops is decreasing. Preventive management by balanced nutrition is least understood and curative management using costly fungicides is becoming a problem. Exclusive fungicide oriented disease control has resulted in residues accumulation harmful to consuming public affecting export trade. This has also resulted in new resistant land races of pathogens. It has been established by Graham (1997) in Australia micronutrients like manganese provide resistance to take all “disease in cereals. It {{is well known that}} manganese, Boron and Copper are involved in phenol metabolism which results in lignin biosynthesis essential for disease resistance in crop plants. Micronutrient disorders of Zn, Mn, B, Cu and Fe are widespread in India (Anonymous 1995) and correction of these disorders has resulted in resistance to diseases. <b>Panama</b> <b>wilt</b> in Banana, Blossom blight in Mango and die back in citrus are important diseases reducing the yield by 15 - 25 percent and death of plants if not controlled. Hence study was initiated to identify the important micronutrient disorders and to study the effect of correction in <b>panama</b> <b>wilt</b> management a serious disease of the crop...|$|E

The results of experiment revealed {{that among the}} micro nutrients used, borax @ 500 and 750 ppm completely inhibited the mycelial growth of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense followed by zinc sulphate (47. 3, 42. 7, 31. 0 and 14. 3 mm at 100, 250, 500 and 750 ppm respectively). The incorporation of borax in solid medium at higher concentrations viz., 500 and 750 ppm., significantly decreased the mycelial growth of the T. viride, whereas the sporulation capacity of T. viride (207. 48 x 108 spores / sq. cm @ 500 ppm) {{was found to be}} maximised by the addition of borax. In general, the antagonist was compatible with borax at low concentrations. The maximum inhibition of mycelial growth of F. oxysporum f. sp cubense was found in borax and T. viride inoculated medium...|$|E
40|$|<b>Panama</b> <b>wilt</b> {{caused by}} Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) {{is one of}} the major disease {{constraints}} of banana production. Previously, we reported the disease resistance Musa paradisiaca cv. puttabale clones developed from Ethylmethanesulfonate and Foc culture filtrate against Foc inoculation. Here, the same resistant clones and susceptible clones were used for the study of protein accumulation against Foc inoculation by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE), their expression pattern and an in silico approach. The present investigation revealed mass-spectrometry identified 16 proteins that were over accumulated and 5 proteins that were under accumulated as compared to the control. The polyphosphoinositide binding protein ssh 2 p (PBPssh 2 p) and Indoleacetic acid-induced-like (IAA) protein showed significant up-regulation and down-regulation. The docking of the pathogenesis-related protein (PR) with the fungal protein endopolygalacturonase (PG) exemplify the three ionic interactions and seven hydrophobic residues that tends to good interaction at the active site of PG with free energy of assembly dissociation (1. 5 kcal/mol). The protein-ligand docking of the Peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase chloroplastic-like protein (PMSRc) with the ligand �- 1, 3 glucan showed minimum binding energy (� 6. 48 kcal/mol) and docking energy (� 8. 2 kcal/mol) with an interaction of nine amino-acid residues. These explorations accelerate the research in designing the host pathogen interaction studies for the better management of diseases...|$|E

40|$|Abaca (Musa textilis Nee) is an {{important}} industrial crop. Its cultivation in Indonesia is, however, hampered by the <b>wilt</b> (<b>Panama</b> disease) caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) infections. Developing Foc resistance abaca lines require availability of established and reliable screening methods for resistance against Foc. The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the (i) effectiveness of Foc inoculation methods, (ii) extent of Foc conidial densities – for causing the wilt in abaca, and (iii) responses of ten abaca cultivars against Foc infection. Results of this study showed that the method of inoculation by wounding abaca roots followed submerging the wounded plant in suspension of Foc conidia (106 conidia/ml) for 2 hours before planting was the most effective method for causing the wilt. Among ten abaca cultivars tested, none was resistant to Foc infection. Based on the calculation of disease intensity, nine abaca cultivars were identified as very susceptible, where as one cultivar was susceptible to Foc infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} table choice elite {{variety of}} Karnataka, NanjanagudRasabale {{is in the}} verge of extinction due to the serious outbreak of <b>panama</b> <b>wilt</b> disease in the Nanjangudtaluk of Mysore district. Banana cultivar Rasthali (AAB) has been chosen to do In vitro studies on somatic embryogenesis. Embryogenic callus and somatic embryos were generated with male flower buds on MS medium supplemented with 2, 4 -D (18. 10 μM), NAA (5. 37 μM) and IAA (5. 71 μM) with 3 % sucrose and 0. 2 % gel rite. After 6 – 8 months well developed somatic embryos were sub cultured on to MS supplemented with NAA (1. 07 µM), Zeatin (0. 23 µM), 2 ip (0. 60 µM) and kinetin (0. 46 µM) for further maturation. Several morphological embryo variants have been observed which brought the germination frequency to the lesser extent. Histological and histochemical studies revealed that all the embryos making up the clump were developed asynchronously and had different patterns of development. Regardless of the stage of maturation, {{a large number of}} somatic embryos showed structural abnormalities some of which could be detected by histological observation. Different embryogenic structures were developed without passing through recognizable stages of zygotic embryogenesis. Localization of starch, total insoluble proteins and nucleic acids were observed in the somatic embryos. Evidence presented in this study points towards abnormalities which may cause somaclonal variations in the economically important plant like banana cv. Rasthali...|$|E
50|$|After being {{discharged}} from the army in 1957, Wornick entered graduate school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, studying under the food scientist Bernard E. Proctor. During this time he also worked part-time at the National Fisheries Institute (NFI) developing processes for testing the freshness of fish based on trimethylamine oxide levels. In 1959, midway through graduate school, Wornick took a temporary {{leave of absence from}} MIT in order to pursue a paid position as a library assistant at the research center of United Fruit Company in Norwood, Massachusetts. At the time, United Fruit Company (the predecessor to Chiquita Brands International Inc) was struggling to contain the spread of a soil-born fungus destroying its banana farms in Latin America, known as <b>Panama</b> disease (Fusarium <b>Wilt).</b> Wornick, who helped come up with a treatment for Panama Disease, was promoted to scientist and later a division president in charge of food processing. MIT awarded him a graduate degree shortly thereafter.|$|R
40|$|A foliar {{rating system}} was {{developed}} to assess the progress of Fusarium <b>wilt</b> (<b>Panama</b> disease) caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense in seven banana cultivars differing in their resistance to race 1 of the pathogen. Plantlets were transplanted into unamended soil naturally infested with the pathogen, soil amended with urea and soil amended with aged chicken manure. A corm invasion score was also developed to assess {{the accuracy of the}} foliar symptom score as an indicator of cultivar resistance. On the basis of foliar symptom scores alone, the response of five of the seven cultivars in the chicken manure treatment corresponded to their known field response. However, the response of the other two cultivars, both susceptible to the pathogen in the field, fell into two categories. One had a high foliar symptom score and a correspondingly high corm invasion score, whereas the other had a low foliar symptom score and a high corm invasion score. Breeders {{need to be aware of}} the two categories of susceptible response, if inferior breeding material is to be rejected early on in a breeding program...|$|R
40|$|Abaca (Musa textilis Nee) is an {{important}} industrial crop. However, the cultivation of this crop in Indonesia is hampered by Fusarium <b>wilt</b> (<b>Panama</b> disease) {{as a result of}} Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) infection. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate inhibitory effects of culture filtrates (CF) of three Foc isolates (Banyuwangi, Malang, and Bojonegoro isolates) on shoot growth of abaca cv. Tangongon and Sangihe- 1, (ii) determine sublethal concentration of Foc CF, (iii) isolate variant cells/tissues which are insensitive against Foc CF and regenerate plantlets from the variants, and (iv) evaluate responses of the plantlets against Foc infection. The results of the experiment showed that even though CF of all Foc isolates inhibited abaca’s shoot growth, CF of Foc Banyuwangi isolate showed the most inhibitory effect. Sublethal concentration of CF of Foc Banyuwangi isolate was 40 %. From abaca cv. Tangongon, 326 shoots were regenerated from CF insensitive embryogenic calli while from Sangihe- 1 - 176 shoots were regenerated. Following acclimatization and Foc inoculation using detached-leaf dual culture test, a total of four immune, two resistant, and two moderately resistant plantlets were identified out of 45 tested variants of Tangongon. On the other hand, only two resistant and one moderately resistant plantlets were identified out of 10 tested variants of Sangihe- 1...|$|R
40|$|Isolation of {{endophytic}} fungi {{was done}} to find alternative microorganisms as antifungal agent against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), causing <b>Panama</b> disease (fusarium <b>wilt)</b> on Musa spp. The research objectives were 1) to isolate and identify endophytic fungi colonize cavendish (AAA) and rejang (AA) bananas growing on PT Natural Tropical Fruit (NTF) Plantation in East Lampung; and 2) to evaluate for their antagonistic activity against Foc under in vitro conditions. The results indicated 46 isolates of endophytic fungi that were isolated from leaves, saplings and petioles of cavendish banana; and leaves and petioles of rejang banana. The isolated endophytic fungi belonging {{to the group of}} Colletotrichum, Fusarium, Guignardia, Penicillium, Talaromyces and non sporulating endophytic fungi that were classified as unidentified isolate. Fourteen isolates (30. 43 %) of those 46 fungi isolates tested, showed varying degree of antagonism to Foc. The best three isolates that have strong antagonistic activities were Talaromyces sp. 27 - 4 (M), unidentified 23 - 3 / 11 (B) and unidentified 26 - 5 /K (L). Fusarium oxysporum 22 - 3 /F (I), Penicillium sp. 20 - 2 /H (J), Talaromyces sp. 27 - 4 (M) and unidentified 21 - 1 / 6 (A) inhibited the growth of Foc by producing both volatile and unvolatile metabolites. The strongest inhibition (53. 17 %) by volatile inhibitory subtance was produced by F. oxysporum 22 - 3 /F (I), while the strongest inhibition (65. 98 %) by unvolatile inhibitory subtance was produced by Penicillium sp. 20 - 2 /H (J) ...|$|R
40|$|Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), {{the causal}} agent of Fusarium <b>wilt</b> (<b>Panama</b> disease), {{is one of}} the most devastating {{diseases}} of banana (Musa spp.). The Foc tropical race 4 (TR 4) is currently known as a major concern in global banana production. No effective resistance is known in Musa to Foc, and no effective measures for controlling Foc once banana plants have been infected in place. Early and accurate detection of Foc TR 4 is essential to protect banana industry and guide banana planting. A real-time fluorescence loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (RealAmp) was developed for the rapid and quantitative detection of Foc TR 4 in soil. The detection limit of the RealAmp assay was approximately 0. 4 pg/µl plasmid DNA when mixed with extracted soil DNA or 10 (3) spores/g of artificial infested soil, and no cross-reaction with other relative pathogens were observed. The RealAmp assay for quantifying genomic DNA of TR 4 was confirmed by testing both artificially and naturally infested samples. Quantification of the soil-borne pathogen DNA of Foc TR 4 in naturally infested samples was no significant difference compared to classic real-time PCR (P> 0. 05). Additionally, RealAmp assay was visual with an improved closed-tube visual detection system by adding SYBR Green I fluorescent dye to the inside of the lid prior to amplification, which avoided the inhibitory effects of the stain on DNA amplification and makes the assay more convenient in the field and could thus become a simple, rapid and effective technique that has potential as an alternative tool for the detection and monitoring of Foc TR 4 in field, which would be a routine DNA-based testing service for the soil-borne pathogen in South China...|$|R
40|$|Fusarium <b>wilt</b> (<b>Panama</b> disease) {{caused by}} Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (FOC) {{represents}} a significant threat to banana (Musa spp.) production. Musa AAB {{is susceptible to}} Race 1 (FOC 1) and Race 4 (FOC 4), while Cavendish Musa AAA {{is found to be}} resistant to FOC 1 but still susceptible to Race 4. A polygalacturonase (PGC 3) was purified from the supernatant of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense race 4 (FOC 4), which is the pathogen of Fusarium wilt. PGC 3 had an apparent molecular weight of 45 kDa according to SDS-PAGE. The enzyme hydrolyzed polygalacturonic acid in an exo-manner, as demonstrated by analysis of degradation products. The Km and Vmax values of PGC 3 from FOC 4 were determined to be 0. 70 mg·mL− 1 and 101. 01 Units·mg·protein− 1 ·min− 1, respectively. Two pgc 3 genes encoding PGC 3 from FOC 4 and FOC 1, both genes of 1368 bp in length encode 456 amino-acid residues with a predicted signal peptide sequence of 21 amino acids. There are 16 nucleotide sites difference between FOC 4 -pgc 3 and FOC 1 -pgc 3, only leading to four amino acid residues difference. In order to obtain adequate amounts of protein required for functional studies, two genes were cloned into the expression vector pPICZaA and then expressed in Pichia pastoris strains of SMD 1168. The recombinant PGC 3, r-FOC 1 -PGC 3 and r-FOC 4 -PGC 3, were expressed and purified as active proteins. The optimal PGC 3 activity was observed at 50 °C and pH 4. 5. Both recombinant PGC 3 retained > 40 % activity at pH 3 – 7 and > 50 % activity in 10 – 50 °C. Both recombinant PGC 3 proteins could induce a response but with different levels of tissue maceration and necrosis in banana plants. In sum, our results indicate that PGC 3 is an exo-PG and can be produced with full function in P. pastoris...|$|R
