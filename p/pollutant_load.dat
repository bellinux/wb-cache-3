25|$|In highly {{regulated}} developed countries, {{industrial effluent}} usually receives at least pretreatment if not full {{treatment at the}} factories themselves to reduce the <b>pollutant</b> <b>load,</b> before discharge to the sewer. This process is called industrial wastewater treatment or pretreatment.

25|$|Sewage {{treatment}} {{may also be}} referred to as wastewater treatment, although the latter is a broader term which can also be applied to purely industrial wastewater. For most cities, the sewer system will also carry a proportion of industrial effluent to the sewage treatment plant which has usually received pretreatment at the factories themselves to reduce the <b>pollutant</b> <b>load.</b> If the sewer system is a combined sewer then it will also carry urban runoff (stormwater) to the sewage treatment plant. Sewage water can travel towards treatment plants via piping and in a flow aided by gravity and pumps. The first part of filtration of sewage typically includes a bar screen to filter solids and large objects which are then collected in dumpsters and disposed of in landfills. Fat and grease is also removed before the primary treatment of sewage.|$|E

40|$|Collecting and {{analyzing}} water quality samples is costly and typically requires significant effort compared to streamflow data, thus water quality data are typically collected {{at a low}} frequency. Regression models, identifying a relationship between streamflow and water quality data, are often used to estimate <b>pollutant</b> <b>loads.</b> A web-based tool using LOAD ESTimator (LOADEST) as a core engine with four modules was developed to provide user-friendly interfaces and input data collection via web access. The first module requests and receives streamflow and water quality data from the U. S. Geological Survey. The second module retrieves watershed area for computation of <b>pollutant</b> <b>loads</b> per unit area. The third module examines potential error of input datasets for LOADEST runs, and the last module computes estimated and allowable annual average <b>pollutant</b> <b>loads</b> and provides tabular and graphical LOADEST outputs. The web-based tool was applied to two watersheds in this study, one agriculturally-dominated and one urban-dominated. It was found that annual sediment load at the urban-dominant watershed exceeded the target load; therefore, the web-based tool identified correctly the watershed requiring best management practices to reduce <b>pollutant</b> <b>loads...</b>|$|R
25|$|Non-stormwater permits {{typically}} include numeric effluent {{limitations for}} specific pollutants. A numeric limitation quantifies the maximum <b>pollutant</b> <b>load</b> or concentration {{allowed in the}} discharge, e.g., 30mg/L of biochemical oxygen demand. Exceeding a numeric limitation constitutes {{a violation of the}} permit, and the discharger is subject to fines as laid out in section 309. Facilities must periodically monitor their effluent (i.e., collect and analyze wastewater samples), and submit Discharge Monitoring Reports to the appropriate agency, to demonstrate compliance. Stormwater permits typically require facilities to prepare a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan and implement best management practices, but do not specify numeric effluent limits and may not include regular monitoring requirements. Some permits cover both stormwater and non-stormwater discharges. NPDES permits must be reissued every five years. Permit agencies (EPA, states, tribes) must provide notice to the public of pending permits and provide an opportunity for public comment.|$|E

Finally the impacts of sediment dredging on internal <b>pollutant</b> <b>loading</b> were quantificationally evaluated. It was found that:(1) the deposition thickness, pollutant contents and release intensity of sediments in Neijiang were all distibuted asymmetrically; (2) sediment dredging significantly decreased the basal elevation of Neijiang and cut down the internal pollutant sources by removing the surface contaminated sediments; (3) After dredging the internal <b>pollutant</b> <b>loading</b> under different hydrological conditions in Neijiang was evidently reduced...|$|R

Japanese agriculture has created high nitrogen surpluses in agricultural lands due to the increasing rate of chemical fertilizer application and the increase of livestock. In this study, to estimate the nitrogen load exported to Koise River, a major river in Lake Kasumigaura, from its catchment area, extensive field survey and water quality experiments have been conducted from 2007 to 2008. Remote sensing data of QuickBird imagery was applied to the dataset on water quality during two years (Year 2007 for model calibration and Year 2008 for model validation) at 11 streams. Water quality indicator of total nitrogen (TN) were examined and an efficient approach, which estimates monthly <b>pollutant</b> <b>loads</b> directly from satellite imagery and ground observed hydrological data, was investigated.

However, the improved model, called the L-THIA asymptotic curve number (ACN) model cannot simulate <b>pollutant</b> <b>loads</b> from a watershed or instream water quality. In this study, a module for calculating <b>pollutant</b> <b>loads</b> from fields and through stream networks was developed, and the L-THIA ACN model was {{combined with the}} QUAL 2 E model (The enhanced stream water quality model) to predict instream water quality at a watershed scale. The new model (L-THIA ACN-WQ) was applied to two watersheds within the Korean total maximum daily loads management system. To evaluate the model, simulated results of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were compared with observed water quality data collected at eight-day intervals. Between simulated and observed data for TN <b>pollutant</b> <b>loads</b> in Dalcheon A watershed, the R 2 and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) were 0. 81 and 0. 79, respectively, and those for TP were 0. 79 and 0. 78, respectively.

Current practice involves the estimation of <b>pollutant</b> <b>loads</b> based on land use type. As WSUD seeks to emphasise ‘at source’ controls {{there is a need to}} estimate for finer scale catchments.
