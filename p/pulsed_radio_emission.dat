40|$|The main {{thrust of}} this thesis is {{the search for}} radio pulsars using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). LOFAR {{is part of a}} new {{generation}} of radio telescopes leading up to the building of the Square Kilometer Array. LOFAR uses a multitude of inexpensive antennas whose signals are combined digitally to create many sensitive, fully steerable, beams on the sky. As part of LOFAR's commissioning we performed two radio pulsar surveys, the LOFAR Pilot Pulsar Survey (LPPS) and the LOFAR Tied-Array Survey (LOTAS). The former survey put a limit on the fast radio transient rate and re-detected 65 pulsars, while the latter re-detected 27 pulsars and discovered 2 new ones. These discoveries bode well for future, more sensitive, pulsar surveys using LOFAR. We also describe extensions to standard single-pulse search techniques. This thesis furthermore describes two smaller projects; attempts to detect pulsars as binary companions to subdwarf-B stars and an attempt to detect <b>pulsed</b> <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> from the nearby pulsar Geminga. We were able to exclude <b>pulsed</b> <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> from the sdB binary companions to a high degree of certainty.

40|$|This {{manuscript}} will {{be submitted}} to the journal Monthly Weather Review published by the American Meteorological Society. 2 Abstract Narrow Bipolar Events (NBEs) are a recently studied intracloud electrical-discharge process. It is speculated that an NBE is instigated by the extensive atmospheric shower of an energetic cosmic ray. NBEs cause significant relaxation of the charge separation within the electrified cloud in a short time, {{on the order of}} 10 ms. The current flow causes radiation of a distinctive “bipolar ” low-frequency/very-low-frequency signal that can be recorded at locations on Earth up to thousands of km from the source. NBEs are preceded/accompanied by the most powerful very-high-frequency <b>radio</b> <b>emissions</b> seen in any kind of lightning. These intense <b>pulsed</b> <b>radio</b> <b>emissions</b> have been routinely detected with satellite-borne radio receivers in space. Owing to their easy detection and recognition, NBEs might be a useful remote-sensing proxy for space-based global, near-real-time remote sensing.

We detected no significant <b>pulsed</b> <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> from these pulsars and have set an upper limit of 0. 07 mJy on the 1374 MHz flux from AX J 1811. 5 − 1926 and upper limits of 0. 18 mJy and 0. 06 mJy for the flux from PSR J 0537 − 6910 at 660 MHz and 1374 MHz, respectively. Assuming a power law radio spectral index of 2, these flux limits correspond to luminosity limits at 400 MHz of 20 mJy kpc 2 for AX J 1811. 5 − 1926 and 1100 mJy kpc 2 for PSR J 0537 − 6910.

40|$|International audienceThe {{study of}} pulsars {{at the lowest}} radio {{frequencies}} observable from the ground (10 - 30 MHz) is complicated by strong interstellar (dispersion, scattering) and ionospheric (scintillation, refraction) propagation effects, as well as intense Galactic background noise and interference. However, it permits us to measure interstellar plasma parameters (the effects of which increase by a power of two to > 4 times the wavelength), the spectrum and the pulse profile at low frequencies more accurately. Up to now, only ˜ 10 pulsars have been successfully detected at these frequencies. The recent upgrade of the receivers at the Ukrainian T-shaped Radio telescope, second modification (UTR- 2) has increased its sensitivity and motivated a new search for <b>pulsed</b> <b>radio</b> <b>emissions.</b> In this work we carried out a survey of known pulsars with declination above - 10 °, period > 0. 1 s and dispersion measure (DM) < 30 pc cm- 3, i. e. a sample of 74 sources. Our goal was either to detect pulsars not recorded before in the decametre range or to identify factors that prevent their detection. As a result, we have detected the <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> of 40 pulsars, i. e. 55 per cent of the observed sample. For 30 of them, this was a first detection at these frequencies. Parameters of their average profiles have been calculated, including the intrinsic widening of the pulse (not due to interstellar scattering) with decreasing frequency. Furthermore, two pulsars beyond the selected DM (B 0138 + 59 with DM ≈ 35 pc cm- 3 and B 0525 + 21 with DM ≈ 51 pc cm- 3) were also detected.

40|$|Macroscopic physics are {{discussed}} {{for the case}} of a disk close to an isolated, magnetized, rotating neutron star that acts as a Faraday disk dynamo, while the disk acts as both a load and a neutral sheet.

The continuum spectral energy distribution and fractional polarization can be well modeled using gyrosynchrotron emission with mean magnetic field B ∼ 10 − 70 G, mildly relativistic power-law electrons of number density ne ∼ 105 − 6 cm− 3, and source size R ∼ 2 Rs. The pulsed emission exhibits a variety of time-variable characteristics, including large frequency drifts, high and low frequency cutoffs, and multiple pulses per period.

For {{all of the}} target AXPs, the upper limits on integrated pulsed emission are ~ 0. 02 mJy, while the limits on the flux of single pulses are ~ 1 Jy or better. The corresponding radio luminosity limits are significantly below the observed luminosities {{of the majority of}} the observed radio pulsars, and they are significantly below the radio luminosity of XTE J 1810 - 197, the only AXP known thus far to emit radio pulsations, at the epoch when radio pulses were first detected from this source. Our null results support the hypothesis that <b>pulsed</b> <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> from AXPs is only present in conjunction with X-ray outburst activity.

40|$|High {{magnetic}} fields are a distinguishing feature of neutron {{stars and the}} existence of sources (the soft gamma repeaters and the anomalous X-ray pulsars) hosting an ultra-magnetized neutron star (or magnetar) has been recognized in the past few decades. Magnetars are believed to be powered by magnetic energy and not by rotation, as with normal radio pulsars. Until recently, the radio quietness and {{magnetic fields}} typically above the quantum critical value (Bq~ 4. 4 x 10 ^{ 13 } G), were among the characterizing properties of magnetars. The recent discovery of <b>radio</b> <b>pulsed</b> <b>emission</b> from a few of them, and of a low dipolar magnetic field soft gamma repeater, weakened further the idea of a clean separation between normal pulsars and magnetars.

40|$|The {{effect of}} photon-beam-induced {{turbulence}} on propagation of <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> in a pulsar magnetosphere is discussed. Beamed <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> {{with a high}} brightness temperature can generate low-frequency plasma waves in the pulsar magnetosphere and these waves scatter the radio beam. We consider this effect on propagation of <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> both in the open field line region and in the closed field line region. The former is applicable to most cases of pulsar <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> where the propagation is confined to the polar region; it is shown that the induced process is not effective for <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> of moderately high brightness temperature but can have a severe effect on giant pulses. For giant pulses not {{to be affected by}} this process, they must be emitted very close to the light cylinder. We show that the induced process is efficient in the closed field line region, inhibiting propagation of the <b>radio</b> <b>emission</b> in this region.
