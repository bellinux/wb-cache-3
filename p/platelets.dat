40|$|Abstract Objectives Use of potent {{antiplatelet}} drugs requires {{evaluation of}} <b>platelet</b> function. While <b>platelet</b> function in elective cases is usually assessed {{in a central}} laboratory environment, {{there is also an}} urgent need for rapid perioperative point-of-care assessment. Recently, multiple electrode <b>platelet</b> aggregometry has been developed and assumed to measure <b>platelet</b> function independent from <b>platelet</b> count. We tested the hypothesis that results of multiple electrode <b>platelet</b> aggregometry are affected by <b>platelet</b> count, in particular if <b>platelet</b> count is below normal range. Methods Whole blood samples from 20 healthy volunteers were prepared containing <b>platelet</b> concentrations of 50, 000, 100, 000, 150, 000, 200, 000, and 250, 000 μl - 1 while maintaining hematocrit. <b>Platelet</b> aggregation was induced by collagen, thrombin receptor activating peptide 6 (TRAP- 6), adenosine-diphoshate (ADP), and arachidonic acid, respectively, and aggregation was measured by multiple electrode <b>platelet</b> aggregometry (Multiplate™). Results Results of multiple electrode <b>platelet</b> aggregometry significantly decreased in blood samples with <b>platelet</b> count below normal range. Compared to results measured in blood samples with <b>platelet</b> count within normal range, aggregometry results decreased by 18. 4 % (p - 1, respectively. On the other hand, large interindividual variation has been observed and some blood samples showed normal results even with <b>platelet</b> counts of 50. 000 μl - 1. Conclusion The results obtained with Multiplate™ Analyzer are influenced by <b>platelet</b> function as well as <b>platelet</b> count thus displaying the overall <b>platelet</b> aggregability within the blood sample rather than <b>platelet</b> function alone. </p...|$|R

5|$|Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) is {{the development}} of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), due to the administration of various forms of heparin, an anticoagulant. HIT predisposes to thrombosis (the abnormal formation of blood clots inside a blood vessel) because <b>platelets</b> release microparticles that activate thrombin, thereby leading to thrombosis. When thrombosis is identified the condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT is caused by the formation of abnormal antibodies that activate <b>platelets.</b> If someone receiving heparin develops new or worsening thrombosis, or if the platelet count falls, HIT can be confirmed with specific blood tests.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the use of}} <b>platelet</b> volume indices {{in the interpretation of}} thrombocytopenia in dogs with systemic disease. Methods: Case records of 80 control dogs and 159 thrombocytopenic dogs with systemic disease were reviewed retrospectively. The relationships between mean <b>platelet</b> volume, <b>platelet</b> distribution width and <b>platelet</b> count in systemically well dogs were established. Knowledge of these relationships was used to interpret thrombocytopenia in terms of the underlying disease process. Results: There was a positive relationship between <b>platelet</b> distribution width and mean <b>platelet</b> volume. Both <b>platelet</b> distribution width and mean <b>platelet</b> volume varied in a negative relationship with <b>platelet</b> count, which was unaffected by signalment, underlying disease, variations in haematological parameters or serum proteins.

Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of PGI2 is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems.

5|$|The {{earliest}} change detectable on laboratory investigations {{is a low}} {{white blood}} cell count, which may then be followed by low <b>platelets</b> and metabolic acidosis. A moderately elevated level of aminotransferase (AST and ALT) from the liver is commonly associated with low <b>platelets</b> and white blood cells. In severe disease, plasma leakage results in hemoconcentration (as indicated by a rising hematocrit) and hypoalbuminemia. Pleural effusions or ascites can be detected by physical examination when large, but the demonstration of fluid on ultrasound may assist in the early identification of dengue shock syndrome. The use of ultrasound is limited by lack of availability in many settings. Dengue shock syndrome is present if pulse pressure drops to ≤20mmHg along with peripheral vascular collapse. Peripheral vascular collapse is determined in children via delayed capillary refill, rapid heart rate, or cold extremities. While warning signs are an important aspect for early detection of potential serious disease, the evidence for any specific clinical or laboratory marker is weak.|$|E

Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) induced <b>platelet</b> aggregation in <b>platelet</b> rich plasma (PRP) at a constant <b>platelet</b> count and also the whole blood <b>platelet</b> count and red cell (RBC) count were strongly and independently related to ADP-induced <b>platelet</b> impedance changes.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that: (a) <b>platelet</b> {{activating}} factor induces shock and intestinal injury, (b) exogenous <b>platelet</b> activating factor stimulates synthesis of endogenous <b>platelet</b> activating factor, and (c) tumour necrosis factor alpha and endotoxin synergise to induce shock and bowel injury in animals. These last two effects are largely mediated by <b>platelet</b> activating factor forming phospholipase A 2 A 2, a key enzyme for <b>platelet</b> activating factor synthesis, was examined in mouse intestine.

5|$|The first {{screening}} test in someone {{suspected of having}} HIT is aimed at detecting antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes. This may be with a laboratory test of the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) type. The ELISA test, however, detects all circulating antibodies that bind heparin-PF4 complexes, and may also falsely identify antibodies that do not cause HIT. Therefore, those with a positive ELISA are tested further with a functional assay. This test uses <b>platelets</b> and serum from the patient; the <b>platelets</b> are washed and mixed with serum and heparin.

5|$|The {{mechanism}} behind arterial thrombosis, such as {{with heart}} attacks, is more established than {{the steps that}} cause venous thrombosis. With arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such damage. The beginning of venous thrombosis {{is thought to be}} caused by tissue factor, which leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by fibrin deposition. Red blood cells and fibrin are the main components of venous thrombi, and the fibrin appears to attach to the blood vessel wall lining (endothelium), a surface that normally acts to prevent clotting. <b>Platelets</b> and white blood cells are also components. <b>Platelets</b> are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones, but they may play a role. Inflammation is associated with VTE, and white blood cells {{play a role in the}} formation and resolution of venous clots.|$|E
5|$|All {{anticoagulants}} {{are generally}} contraindicated {{in situations where}} the reduction in clotting that they cause might lead to serious and potentially life-threatening bleeds.
