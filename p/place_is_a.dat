5|$|Between the Humber and Forth the English {{had formed}} into two main kingdoms, Deira and Bernicia, often united as the Kingdom of Northumbria. A number of Celtic kingdoms also existed in this region, {{including}} Craven, Elmet, Rheged, and Gododdin. A native British kingdom, later called the Kingdom of Strathclyde, survived {{as an independent}} power into the 10th century in the area which became modern-day Dunbartonshire and Clydesdale. To the north-west of Strathclyde lay the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata, and to the north-east {{a small number of}} Pictish kingdoms. Further north still lay the great Pictish kingdom of Fortriu, which after the Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685 came to be the strongest power in the northern half of Britain. The Irish had always had contacts {{with the rest of the}} British Isles, and during the early 6th century they immigrated from the island of Ireland to form the kingdom of Dál Riata, although exactly how much conquest took <b>place</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> matter of dispute with historians. It also appears likely that the Irish settled in parts of Wales, and even after the period of Irish settlement, Irish missionaries were active in Britain.|$|E
5|$|XIII-2 begins {{three years}} after the end of XIII. Owing to the fall of Cocoon at the end of XIII and the {{collapse}} of its government (the Sanctum), at the start of XIII-2, most of Cocoon's inhabitants have moved down onto Gran Pulse, and some have learned magical abilities. Over the course of the game, a scientific body called the Academy becomes a new technocratic government. While the game starts off in the year 3 AF ('AF' being a new timescale set up after the fall of Cocoon), the story of XIII-2 jumps around several different time periods, and even parallel versions of different places, accessed via the Historia Crux. While most of the game takes place on Gran Pulse and inside Cocoon, there are two other major locations. One is the Void Beyond, a limbo between time periods. The other location is Valhalla, the capital of the goddess Etro. This <b>place</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> realm at the end of time where the goddess keeps a dark energy called Chaos from escaping and destroying the timeline.|$|E

25|$|The <b>place</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> good, {{intact and}} {{representative}} {{example of the}} work of architect, Dr Karl Langer, and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of his work.

As the largest commission of his career, it is a rare illustration of Langer's principles applied on a large scale.|$|E
