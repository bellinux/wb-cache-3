Past this, there is no requirement that particular language be used. In Re Kayford, Megarry J held that [...] "it is well settled that a trust can be created without using the word [...] "trust" [...] or [...] "confidence" [...] or the like; the question is whether in substance a sufficient intention to create a trust has been manifested". In Paul v Constance, [...] it was held that the phrase [...] "the money is as much yours as it is mine" [...] was sufficient to translate to a trust. A trust will not be formed if it is clear that some other intention was there, such as the intention to make a pure gift, as in Jones v Lock. Historically, <b>precatory</b> <b>words</b> such as [...] "it is hoped" [...] and [...] "it is desired" [...] were held to be valid. Since Lambe v Eames, the courts have instead taken the approach that the circumstances and the reading of the statement as a whole are the factors, and that no particular words will impose a trust on their own.|$|E
