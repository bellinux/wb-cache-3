40|$|In {{the current}} study, {{modification}} of NSSC <b>pulp</b> <b>broke</b> fibers {{was done by}} forming starch polymeric multilayers, using Layer-by-Layer (LbL) layering method. After fiber slushing and preparation of pulp suspension with 0. 5 % consistency and conductivity formation of about 437 µS/cm, adding water solution of 1 mM NaCl, the experiments of fibers treatment were conducted to build the polymeric layers (up to 5 consecutive layers). Afterward, water retention value (WRV) of fibers was calculated in samples to evaluate the influence of this method on fibers hydrophilicity. The fibers were then used to prepare standard handsheets (60 ± 3 g/m 2) and the physical and strength properties of sheets were evaluated {{as a function of}} the number of layers deposited on the fibers. The results showed that the WRV index of the fibers was improved by the LbL treatment of NSSC broke pulp fibers, due to the increase in starch electrostatic absorption. Successive variation in paper apparent density increase and paper thickness decrease confirmed the construction of starch multilayers on the surface of broke fibers. Formation of such multilayers on broke fibers has led to considerable improvement in tensile index (from 13. 21 N. m/g to 30. 65 N. m/g) and burst index (from 1. 23 kPa. m 2 /g to 2. 36 kPa. m 2 /g). Also, the prepared SEM micrographs approve the sheet web compaction and paper mechanical improvement resulted due to an increase in inter-fiber bonding...|$|E
50|$|A liquid {{packaging}} board {{might be}} up to five plies and is formed on a multi-ply paper machine with online coating. The most common is to use three plies with a basis weight of about 300 g/m2. The base or middle ply is normally made of pulp from bleached or unbleached chemical <b>pulp,</b> CTMP or <b>broke</b> (waste paper from a paper machine). CTMP gives more bulk and stiffness. The top ply (inside) is made of bleached chemical pulp. The barrier coating depend of the application and might be applied on both sides. When induction welding is employed an aluminum foil layer is used for barrier protection and for heating. The {{back side of the}} board is the printing side and might have an extra ply made from chemical pulp of quality that is suitable for the printing applications. Liquid packages are normally heat sealed.|$|R
