The producers provide capital for and control theprocessing entity so that their interests are aligned. Returns to producers bundle together the commodity price and the return from the capital invested in processing. Many of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>product</b> markets in New Zealand operate within this cooperative structure {{and in the case}} of the dairy industry it has been required by statute. The forestry wine and processed vegetable industries are notable exceptions in that these industries use contracts between producers and processors as an alternative to vertical integration via co-operatives. In this paper we use examples of contracts between producers and processors in the forestry wine and processed vegetable markets to consider the extent to which contracts may provide efficient vehicles for the alignment of interests between producers and processors in agricultural markets. We consider the ways in which these contracts: Minimise transaction costs; Use incentive mechanisms and monitoring to limit opportunism; Allocate risk; Facilitate investment in specific assets; and Allocate property rights.

A pilot scale 27. 12 -MHz and 6 -kW RF system was used to determine the operational parameters, the drying curve, and the quality attributes of the processed nuts. The results showed that an electrode gap of 15. 5 cm and a hot air temperature of 50 Â°C provided an acceptable heating rate and stable sample temperatures, and were used for further drying tests. The drying curves showed an exponential decay and required 750 and 360 min to achieve the final moisture content of 0. 030 kg water/kg dry solid (3. 0 % dry basis) in whole nuts in hot air drying and RF heating/hot air combined drying, respective-ly. The drying kinetics of the nuts were described well by the Page model for hot air drying, but a logarithmic model was more suited for RF/hot air drying.

40|$|In Ghana, the {{agricultural}} sector {{in general and the}} tomato sector in particular have not met their potential. In the tomato sector, production seasonality, the dominance of rainfed agriculture, high perishability of the fruits combined with no storage facilities, and poor market access, have resulted in low average yields but seasonal gluts with some farmers unable to sell their tomatoes which are consequently left to rot in their fields. The tomato value chain in Ghana is characterised by a âtwo levelâ system in which itinerant tradersâthe market queens âare the direct link between rural farm producers and urban consumption, rather than by a set of assembly markets which bulk the produce before being sold to urban wholesalers at relay markets. Assembly markets enable inspection, grading, and better price transmission, but the time taken to get the crop from farmgate to consumer is relatively long. The two-level trader system reduces delays of passing through assembly markets, allowing rapid movement of the produce from producer to consumer, important for highly <b>perishable</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> such as tomato, but fragments price signals resulting in poor spatial price adjustments (Bell et al. 1999; Orchard and Suglo 1999). In a two level system, farmers are distanced from market signals: most wait for the market queens to come to their fields and if these traders do not come, farmers leave the tomatoes to rot in the field {{in the absence of a}} local market. Traders allocate a certain number of crates, which determines how much farmers can sell on that particular day and there is little if any room for price-quantity or price-quality negotiations. Signals from consumers with respect to quality, price, and quantities demanded, are not transmitted back along the value chain to the farmers. Though packers may remove the poorest quality fruits, tomatoes of different qualities and even different varieties are not graded but rather simply piled them into over-sized crates.

The objective of this project is to carry out a study on an intermittent absorption refrigeration device which consist of two vessels: the first one acts as a generator during the generation cycle and as an absorber in the absorption cycle. The second vessel acts as a receiver during the generation cycle and as an evaporator in the absorption cycle. The device uses aquaammonia solution where ammonia acts as a refrigerant and the water acts as an absorbent. The research contains literature review on absorption refrigeration field, explains the types of intermittent and continuous absorption refrigeration devices, and the main differences between the absorption and mechanical refrigeration. It also explains the ammonia properties in homogeneous binary mixtures. Two experimental tests were conducted: In the first test the absorber temperature was kept at 18 oC, and in the second test the absorber temperature was kept at 11 oC. The objective of these tests is to study the effect of the absorber temperature variation on the coefficient of performance of the absorption refrigeration device, when all other parameters are constant like condenser temperature, mass flow rate of the absorber cooling water and mass of water contained in the evaporator. The results of the experiments were discussed, and the change in pressure and temperature versus the time curves were drawn. Also graphs representing the performance of the absorption refrigeration device during generation and absorption cycles were shown. From the experimental results the coefficient of performance of the intermittent absorption refrigeration device in the first test (when the absorber temperature was about 18 oC) was found to be equal to 0. 0035 and in the second test (when the absorber temperature was about 11 oC) was found to be equal to 0. 013.

On the basis of assumption that distribution demand points for <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> in Shanghai are 117 towns, 13 district governments, 1 People's Government and 1 county government, The cluster analysis method and Floyd algorithm have been employed to achieve minimization of all paths to get the Shanghai <b>agricultural</b> <b>product</b> logistics distribution center alternatives. Combined with the Fuzzy AHP, a comprehensive analysis of Shanghai <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> logistics distribution center alternatives is performed. Thus, the result shows Zhenru Town in Putuo district is the most suitable site for establishing the Shanghai <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> logistics distribution center, improving the development of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> logistics, the urban environment and the living standards of residents in Shanghai.
