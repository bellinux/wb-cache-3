5|$|Simple or {{uncomplicated}} malaria may {{be treated}} with oral medications. The most effective treatment for P.falciparum infection {{is the use of}} artemisinins in combination with other antimalarials (known as artemisinin-combination therapy, or ACT), which decreases resistance to any single drug component. These additional antimalarials include: amodiaquine, lumefantrine, mefloquine or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Another recommended combination is dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine. ACT is about 90% effective when used to treat uncomplicated malaria. To treat malaria during pregnancy, the WHO recommends the use of quinine plus clindamycin early in the pregnancy (1st trimester), and ACT in later stages (2nd and 3rd trimesters). In the 2000s (decade), malaria with partial resistance to artemisins emerged in Southeast Asia. Infection with P.vivax, P.ovale or P.malariae usually do not require hospitalization. Treatment of P.vivax requires both treatment of blood stages (with chloroquine or ACT) and clearance of liver forms with <b>primaquine.</b> Treatment with tafenoquine prevents relapses after confirmed P. vivax malaria.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{understanding}} of the condition began with the analysis of patients who exhibited sensitivity to <b>primaquine.</b> The discovery of G6PD deficiency relied heavily upon the testing of prisoner volunteers at Illinois State Penitentiary, a type of study which today is considered unethical and cannot be performed. When some prisoners were given the drug <b>primaquine,</b> some developed hemolytic anemia but others did not. After studying the mechanism through Cr51 testing, it was conclusively shown that the hemolytic effect of <b>primaquine</b> was due to an intrinsic defect of erythrocytes.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 a Phase IIb {{trial was}} {{completed}} that studied a single-dose alternative drug named tafenoquine. It is an 8-aminoquinoline, {{of the same}} family as <b>primaquine,</b> developed {{by researchers at the}} Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in the 1970s and tested in safety trials. It languished, however, until the push for malaria elimination sparked new interest in <b>primaquine</b> alternatives.|$|E
25|$|Eradication of {{the liver}} stages is {{achieved}} by giving <b>primaquine.</b> Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase risk haemolysis. G6PD is an enzyme important for blood chemistry. No field-ready test is available. Recently, this point has taken particular importance for the increased incidence of vivax malaria among travelers. At least a 14-day course of <b>primaquine</b> {{is required for the}} radical treatment of P. vivax.|$|E
25|$|In 1956 Alving {{and colleagues}} {{showed that in}} some African Americans the {{antimalarial}} drug <b>primaquine</b> induces hemolytic anemia, and that those individuals have an inherited deficiency of G6PD in erythrocytes. G6PD deficiency is sex-linked, and common in Mediterranean, African and other populations. In Mediterranean countries such individuals can develop a hemolytic diathesis (favism) after consuming fava beans. G6PD deficient persons are also sensitive to several drugs in addition to <b>primaquine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mass-treating populations with a <b>primaquine</b> {{can kill}} the hypnozoites, {{exempting}} those with G6PD deficiency. However, the standard regimen requires a daily pill for 14 days across an asymptomatic population.|$|E
25|$|Antipneumocystic {{medication}} is used with concomitant steroids {{in order to}} avoid inflammation, which causes an exacerbation of symptoms about four days after treatment begins if steroids are not used. By far the most commonly used {{medication is}} trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, but some patients are unable to tolerate this treatment due to allergies. Other medications that are used, alone or in combination, include pentamidine, trimetrexate, dapsone, atovaquone, <b>primaquine,</b> pafuramidine maleate (under investigation), and clindamycin. Treatment is usually for a period of about 21 days.|$|E
25|$|Many {{substances}} {{are potentially}} harmful {{to people with}} G6PD deficiency. Variation {{in response to these}} substances makes individual predictions difficult. Antimalarial drugs that can cause acute hemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency include <b>primaquine,</b> pamaquine, and chloroquine. There is evidence that other antimalarials may also exacerbate G6PD deficiency, but only at higher doses. Sulfonamides (such as sulfanilamide, sulfamethoxazole, and mafenide), thiazolesulfone, methylene blue, and naphthalene should also be avoided by people with G6PD deficiency as they antagonize folate synthesis, as should certain analgesics (such as phenazopyridine and acetanilide) and a few non-sulfa antibiotics (nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, isoniazid, dapsone, and furazolidone). Henna has been known to cause hemolytic crisis in G6PD-deficient infants. Rasburicase is also contraindicated in G6PD deficiency. High dose intravenous vitamin C has also been known to cause haemolysis in G6PD deficiency carriers, thus G6PD deficiency testing is routine before infusion of doses of 25g or more.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{patients}} who received a 600-mg dose, 91% were relapse-free after 6 months. Among {{patients who}} received <b>primaquine,</b> 24% relapsed within 6 months. [...] "The data are absolutely spectacular," [...] Wells [...] says. Ideally, he says, researchers {{will be able to}} combine the safety data from the Army's earlier trials with the new study in a submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval. Like <b>primaquine,</b> tafenoquine causes hemolysis in people who are G6PD deficient.|$|E
2500|$|When {{chloroquine}} {{resistance is}} common or when chloroquine is contraindicated, then artesunate is the drug of choice, {{except in the}} U.S., where it is not approved for use. Where an artemisinin-based combination therapy has been adopted as the first-line treatment for P. falciparum malaria, {{it may also be}} used for P. vivax malaria in combination with <b>primaquine</b> for radical cure. An exception is artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP), which is not effective against P. vivax in many places. Mefloquine is a good alternative and in some countries is more readily available. [...] Atovaquone-proguanil is an effective alternative in patients unable to tolerate chloroquine. Quinine may be used to treat vivax malaria but is associated with inferior outcomes.|$|E
2500|$|Access to {{services}} depends on many factors, including whether a refugee has received official status, is situated within a refugee camp, or {{is in the}} process of third country resettlement. The UNHCR recommends integrating access to primary care and emergency health services with the host country in as equitable a manner as possible. Prioritized services include areas of maternal and child health, immunizations, tuberculosis screening and treatment, and HIV/AIDS-related services. Despite inclusive stated policies for refugee access to health care on the international levels, potential barriers to that access include language, cultural preferences, high financial costs, administrative hurdles, and physical distance. Specific barriers and policies related to health service access also emerge based on the host country context. [...] For example, <b>primaquine,</b> an often recommended malaria treatment is not currently licensed for use in Germany and must be ordered from outside the country.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a generic}} drug and is {{available}} under many brand names worldwide, including Jasoprim, Malirid, Neo-Quipenyl, Pimaquin, Pmq, Primachina, Primacin, Primaquina, <b>Primaquine,</b> <b>Primaquine</b> diphosphate, <b>Primaquine</b> Phosphate, and Remaquin.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Primaquine</b> 30 mg once daily (started the {{day before}} travel, and {{continuing}} for seven days after returning): this regimen is not routinely recommended {{because of the need}} for G-6-PD testing prior to starting <b>primaquine</b> (see the article on <b>primaquine</b> for more information).|$|E
50|$|Pamaquine is more toxic {{and less}} efficacious than <b>primaquine.</b> Pamaquine is {{therefore}} no longer {{used and the}} only drug currently recommended by the World Health Organization is <b>primaquine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Primaquine</b> is well-absorbed {{in the gut}} and {{extensively}} {{distributed in}} the body without accumulating in red blood cells. Administration of <b>primaquine</b> with food or grapefruit juice increases its oral bioavailibity. In blood, about 20% of circulating <b>primaquine</b> is protein-bound, with preferential binding to the acute phase protein orosomucoid. With a half-life {{on the order of}} 6 hours, it is quickly metabolized by liver enzymes to carboxyprimaquine, which does not have anti-malarial activity. Renal excretion of the parent drug is less than 4%.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Primaquine</b> is {{primarily}} {{used to prevent}} relapse of malaria due to Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale. [...] It eliminates hypnozoites, the dormant liver form of the parasite, after the plasmodia have been cleared from the bloodstream. If <b>primaquine</b> is not administered to patients with proven P. vivax or P. ovale infection, a very high likelihood of relapse exists for weeks or months (sometimes years). [...] Use in combination with quinine or chloroquine {{each of which is}} very effective at clearing P. vivax from blood, improves outcomes; they appear to also potentiate the action of <b>primaquine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Primaquine</b> {{should not}} be {{administered}} to anyone with G6PD deficiency because a severe reaction can occur, resulting in hemolytic anemia. However, the WHO has recommended that a single dose of <b>primaquine</b> (0.25 mg/kg) is safe to give even in individuals with G6PD deficiency, {{for the purpose of}} preventing transmission of P. falciparum malaria.|$|E
50|$|Pamaquine is {{effective}} against the hypnozoites of the relapsing malarias (P. vivax and P. ovale); and unlike <b>primaquine,</b> {{it is also}} very effective against the erythrocytic stages of all four human malarias. One small clinical trial of pamaquine as a causal prophylactic was disappointing (whereas <b>primaquine</b> is an extremely effective causal prophylactic).|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} of <b>primaquine</b> {{administration}} include nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps.|$|E

50|$|<b>Primaquine</b> is {{an analog}} of {{pamaquine}} {{which was the}} first drug of the 8-aminoquinoline class; tafenoquine is another such drug.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps. <b>Primaquine</b> {{should not be}} given to people with glucose-6-phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (G6PD) deficiency due {{to the risk of}} red blood cell breakdown. It is often recommended that <b>primaquine</b> not be used during pregnancy. It may be okay in breastfeeding when the baby is known not to have G6PD deficiency. The mechanisms of action is not entirely clear but is believed to involve effects on the malaria parasites DNA.|$|E

50|$|<b>Primaquine</b> {{has been}} studied in animal models of Chagas disease and was about four times as {{effective}} as the standard of care, nifurtimox.|$|E
50|$|<b>Primaquine</b> has {{not been}} studied {{extensively}} in people 65 and older {{so it is not}} known if dosing should be adjusted for this population.|$|E
50|$|A mass drug {{administration}} campaign using S/P, artesunate and <b>primaquine</b> {{was completed in}} Moshi district, Tanzania in 2008. The findings {{have yet to be}} published.|$|E
50|$|Like <b>primaquine,</b> {{pamaquine}} causes haemolytic anaemia {{in patients}} with G6PD deficiency. Patients should therefore always be screened for G6PD deficiency prior to being prescribed pamaquine.|$|E
