40|$|This {{study is}} a cross-national {{exploration}} {{of the relation between}} democratic <b>policing</b> <b>reforms</b> and assessments of democracy and respect for human rights in Turkey and fourteen nations. It is based on the rich qualitative case studies of police organizational structures in these 15 countries, unique data made available in Turkey, comparative analyses of different types of regimes, reports of go-vernmental and non-governmental international organizations, and other secondary data analyses. The research seeks an understanding of two research questions: (1) To what degree are democratic <b>policing</b> <b>reforms</b> associated with the level of democracy and respect for human rights in a given country? (2) Which specific democratic <b>policing</b> <b>reforms</b> {{are most likely to be}} associated with higher levels of democracy and respect for human rights? With Turkey and each of 14 other coun-tries, we find a significant role in the rise of democratic <b>policing</b> <b>reforms</b> and assessments of the level of democracy and respect for human rights. Comparative analyses of democracy have given insufficient attention to police and policing organizations (Goldsmith & Sheptycki, 2007; Marenin, 2000; Pino & Wiatrowski, 2006).

25|$|The {{need for}} reform of police in India has been long recognised. There {{has been almost}} 30 years of debate and {{discussion}} by government created committees and commissions on the way forward for <b>police</b> <b>reform,</b> but India remains saddled with an outdated and old-fashioned law, while report after report gathers dust on government bookshelves without implementation. Many committees on police reforms have recommended major reforms in the police system coupled with systematic accountability.|$|E
25|$|Reaction {{to police}} {{brutality}} {{resulted in the}} Watts riots of 1965 and again, after the Rodney King beating, in the Los Angeles riots of 1992. Charges of police brutality dogged the Department {{through the end of}} the 20th century. In the late 1990s, as a result of the Rampart scandal involving misconduct of 70 officers, the federal government was forced to intervene and assumed jurisdiction of the Department with a consent decree. <b>Police</b> <b>reform</b> has since been a major issue confronted by L.A.'s recent mayors.|$|E

The mayor is able to appoint someone to act on his behalf; the current office-holder is Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime, Sophie Linden. The work of MOPAC is scrutinised by the Police and Crime Committee (also known as a police and crime panel) of the London Assembly. These structures were created by the <b>Police</b> <b>Reform</b> and Social Responsibility Act 2011 and replaced the Metropolitan Police Authority appointed board created in 2000 by Greater London Authority Act 1999.|$|E
500|$|Reaching {{beyond the}} slavery issue, the Cabinet {{advanced}} several measures to address calls {{for political and}} administrative reform. However, all of these—including the Law of Free Birth—were only partially effective due to various loopholes. Although declared freeborn, children born to slave mothers were kept, even after the law's enactment, {{under the control of}} slaveowners until age twenty-one. It is true that [...] "unable to reproduce itself, slavery would eventually disappear", but the status quo was preserved for at least two decades. In effect, as historian Roderick J. Barman summarized it, the [...] "law changed everything and it changed nothing". Other reforms also had shortcomings. The <b>police</b> <b>reform</b> legislation of 1871 theoretically limited the police's powers to imprison arbitrarily and protected civil liberties, although they generally ignored these constraints.|$|E
500|$|While at the Times, Dunne {{may have}} made his first {{experiments}} in Irish dialect: an anonymous <b>police</b> <b>reform</b> series published in January 1889. [...] "Officer Quinn and his Friends" [...] features an Irish-American policeman who digs up a suspicious footprint in the snow. Quinn means {{to take it to}} the station but is sidetracked at a saloon, emerging several hours later to find the evidence melted. The writer of the Quinn pieces uses unneeded Irishisms, and his spelling is often awkward. When Dunne took a new job with the Tribune later in 1889, the use of Irish dialect in stories followed him; one account of a conversation between two Irish-American members of the city council is rendered as they would have spoken it. He first signed his name to Irish dialect pieces in the second half of 1890, in a series about real-life Colonel Thomas Jefferson Dolan, a small-time Democratic hanger-on. The series, which ended when Dunne left for the Chicago Herald in late 1890, [...] contains elements of the Dooley stories, including mostly being told from a single perspective (an alter ego for Dunne), as well as painting a detailed portrait of the Irish-American scene. [...] By then, Dunne had polished his use of Irish dialect.|$|E

500|$|The {{number of}} police districts was nearly {{constant}} from 1894 to 2002, {{although a few}} have been creased and closed. However, the organization in the various police districts varied considerably, especially in the cities. In particular, some cities had their civilian responsibilities {{taken care of by}} the municipality. This was confusing for the public, resulting in the police services reorganizing to a homogenous organization during the 1980s, whereby the civil tasks being organized as part of the police stations. Økokrim was established in 1988 and in 1994 the administrative responsibilities for the sheriff's offices was transferred to police districts. Only once has the order to shoot to kill been issued, during the Torp hostage crisis in 1994. The police school became a university college in 1993 and introduced a three-year education; in 1998 a second campus opened in Bodø. <b>Police</b> <b>Reform</b> 2000 was a major restructuring of the police force. First the National Police Directorate was created in 2001, and from 2003 the number of police districts were reduced from 54 to 27. The Police Computing and Material Service and the Criminal Investigation Service were both established in 2004. Ten police officers have been killed in service since 1945. The Gjørv Report following the 2011 Norway attacks criticized several aspects of the police force, labeling the work as [...] "unacceptable". National Commissioner Øystein Mæland withdrew following the criticism, in part because an internal report of the attacks had not found any criticism of the police force.|$|E
500|$|Kanshi Ram {{founded the}} BSP in 1984. Influenced by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, the chief {{architect}} of the Constitution of India, the party's primary focus {{is to improve the}} situation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and other disadvantaged groups through <b>police</b> <b>reform,</b> affirmative action on hiring of members of scheduled castes for government posts, and providing rural development programmes. Reservation in India is a system whereby a percentage of government positions and seats at universities are reserved for persons of backward classes and scheduled castes and tribes. Throughout her political career, Mayawati supported reservation in both government and private sectors for backward classes, with an increase in quotas and inclusion of more communities such as religious minorities and economically weak upper castes. In August 2012 a bill was cleared that starts the process of amending the constitution so that the reservation system can be expanded to promotions in state jobs. Mayawati's career has been called a [...] "miracle of democracy" [...] by former Prime Minister of India P. V. Narasimha Rao. Millions of Dalit supporters view her as an icon and refer to her as [...] "Behen-ji" [...] (sister). Her public meetings have been attended by large audiences, who use slogans such as [...] "Kanshi Ram ka mission Adhoora; karegi Behen Mayawati poora" [...] (Kanshi Ram's unfulfilled mission will be completed by Mayawati) and [...] "Behenji tum sangharsh karo; hum tumhare saath hain" [...] (Sister, go ahead with your struggle; we are with you).|$|E
500|$|The {{parliamentary}} debate {{was held on}} 8 April, {{one day after the}} 2010 general election had been announced, meaning it was during the so-called [...] "wash-up period" [...] when legislation is passed with little scrutiny. Only one hour was spent debating the ban and all three parties agreed, meaning no vote was required. In an interview conducted in July 2010, when he was no longer a minister, Johnson admitted the decision to ban mephedrone was sped up after widespread reporting of deaths caused by the drug, and because the government wished to pass the law before parliament was dissolved prior to the upcoming general election. In January 2011, however, Johnson told the Scunthorpe Telegraph that the decision was based only on information from the ACMD. An editorial in the April 2010 edition of The Lancet questioned the decision to ban mephedrone, saying the ACMD did not have enough evidence to judge the potential harms caused by mephedrone and arguing that policy makers should have sought to understand why young people took it and how they could be influenced to not take it. Evan Harris, then the Liberal Democrat science spokesman, stated the ACMD [...] "was not 'legally constituted'" [...] as required by the Misuse of Drugs Act, when the report on cathinones was published, since after Taylor resigned, it lacked a veterinary surgeon. In the rush to make mephedrone illegal, the act that was passed specified the inactive enantiomer of mephedrone, leaving the active form legal until the loophole was closed in February 2011 by another act of parliament. In Chemistry World, John Mann, professor of chemistry at Queen's University Belfast, suggested the UK create a law similar to the Federal Analog Act of the United States, which would have made mephedrone illegal as an analog of cathinone. In August 2010, James Brokenshire, the Home Office drugs minister, announced plans to create a new category in the Misuse of Drugs Act, through the <b>Police</b> <b>Reform</b> and Social Responsibility Bill, that would allow new legal highs to be made temporarily illegal, without the need for a vote in parliament or advice from the ACMD, as was required to categorise mephedrone.|$|E
