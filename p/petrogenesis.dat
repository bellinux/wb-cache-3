50|$|In {{the recent}} years, fluid {{inclusion}} {{research has been}} extensively applied to understand the role of fluids in the deep crust and crust-mantle interface.

50|$|During the 1840s, a {{development}} by Henry C. Sorby and others firmly {{laid the foundation}} of petrography. This was a technique to study very thin slices of rock. A slice of rock was affixed to a microscope slide and then ground so thin that light could be transmitted through mineral grains that otherwise appeared opaque. The position of adjoining grains was not disturbed, thus permitting analysis of rock texture. Thin section petrography became the standard method of rock study. Since textural details contribute greatly to knowledge of the sequence of crystallization of the various mineral constituents in a rock, petrography progressed into <b>petrogenesis</b> and ultimately into petrology.|$|E
50|$|Despite its {{relative}} rarity, kimberlite has attracted attention because {{it serves as}} a carrier of diamonds and garnet peridotite mantle xenoliths to the Earth's surface. Its probable derivation from depths greater than any other igneous rock type, and the extreme magma composition that it reflects in terms of low silica content and high levels of incompatible trace element enrichment make an understanding of kimberlite <b>petrogenesis</b> important. In this regard, the study of kimberlite has the potential to provide information about the composition of the deep mantle and melting processes occurring at or near the interface between the cratonic continental lithosphere and the underlying convecting asthenospheric mantle.|$|E

5000|$|The {{realization}} that polybaric near-fractional melting {{may be the}} dominant form of basalt <b>petrogenesis</b> was a consequence of difficulties with a simpler paradigm involving only a chemically distinct primary melt, in equilibrium with residual mantle minerals, undergoing fractionation (and transportation) to yield basaltic and Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt (MORB) lava. The assumption of a unique primary melt led to the expectation that chemical and mineral characterization of primitive glasses associated with a basalt would constrain the residual mantle mineral assemblage, temperature, and pressure of the (presumed) primary melt. However, such [...] "inverse" [...] modeling as well as [...] "forward" [...] peridotite melting experiments failed to fully constrain underlying processes, necessitating the use of polybaric near-fractional melting.|$|E
5000|$|Whitlockite has two {{inorganic}} occurrences with geologic significance. The first, {{known as}} terrestrial whitlockite, is found as a secondary mineral in granite pegmatites {{in such areas}} as Custer County, South Dakota, as dine crystals associated with quartz at the Tip Top mine, and at the Palermo mine in North Groton, New Hampshire. [...] The second occurrence is extraterrestrial whitlockite, which is now known as merrillite. Extraterrestrial whitlockite has been identified in lunar samples as well as martian and other types of meteorites, where {{it is one of the}} most common phosphate minerals. Studies of merrillite as an accessory mineral have provided valuable insights that have helped to unlock the <b>petrogenesis</b> of extraterrestrial rocks.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} igneous rock, or <b>petrogenesis</b> , in {{continental}} arcs {{is more complicated}} than that in oceanic arcs. The partial melting of the subducting oceanic slab generates primary magma, which would be contaminated by the continental crust materials when it travels through the crust. Because the continental crust is felsic or silica while the juvenile primary magma is typically mafic, the composition of magmas in continental arcs is the product of mixing between igneous differentiation of mafic magmas and felsic or silica crust meltings. The mixing of existing continental crust, lower part of lithosphere or lithospheric mantle under the continental crust, the subducting oceanic crust and sediments, the mantle wedge and the underplates materials together is the main source of continental arc rocks.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of Parinacota, there is a {{noticeable}} difference between the pre-sector collapse and post-sector collapse magmas, indicating that a large turnover of the magmatic system was triggered by the landslide. More specifically, after the collapse erupted rocks became more mafic and their composition more influenced by fractional crystallization, while the preceding magmas were more strongly affected by mixing processes. Also, magma output increased significantly, while the resting time in the magma chambers decreased. Modelling indicates that over the short term, a collapse would cause activity to stop at a volcano of Parinacota's size, and {{over the long term}} the plumbing system would change and become shallower. Also, the plumbing system of the volcano would become more permissive to denser mafic magmas after a sector collapse, perhaps explaining why the Ajata vents were active after the collapse but the magma erupted through them influenced <b>petrogenesis</b> of main cone magmas much earlier. The magnitude of such changes is considerably larger than at neighbouring volcano Taapaca, where a sector collapse was not accompanied by changes in activity; presumably Parinacota's shallower magma supply system made it more susceptible to the effects of unloading.|$|E
5000|$|In 1889 Adams was {{appointed}} Lecturer in Geology at McGill University. He {{was appointed}} Logan Professor of Geology after {{the retirement of}} John William Dawson in 1892 and held this position until his own retirement in 1924. Though he was working full-time at McGill, he continued to spend summers in the field, financed by the GSC. In 1891 he began working on the Grenville of eastern Ontario, and by the following year had started {{to work on the}} Haliburton, Ontario area. His work there, carried out after 1896 with Alfred Barlow of the GSC, was published as a GSC Memoir in 1908, and became a classic of Canadian geology. The rocks, which included unusual alkaline rocks, were not merely mapped, but studied in detail using petrographic and chemical methods, and firm conclusions were drawn about their <b>petrogenesis,</b> all of which was unusual for a GSC Memoir at that time. At the same time, Adams was also studying the peculiar petrological characteristics of a group of alkaline intrusions of much later geological age (now known to be Early Cretaceous), called by him the [...] "Monteregian Hills." [...] This work would be continued by his students, notably Joseph Austin Bancroft (1882-1957), who succeeded Adams as Logan Professor at McGill. Inspired by his observations on the flow of metamorphosed limestones in the Grenville, Adams began a series of pioneer experimental studies of the physical properties of rocks at high pressures and temperatures, carried out in collaboration with John Thomas Nicholson, Professor of Engineering at McGill. This was well before comparable work was carried out in Germany or the United States. Though the experimental apparatus was primitive compared with that later developed at Harvard University and the Geophysical Laboratory in Washington, D.C., Adams' work was highly regarded by the newly founded Carnegie Institution for Science, which supported him financially, and attempted to persuade him to move to the Institution.|$|E
