40|$|Efficiency of the Ananas comosus (L.) Merr. flower {{induction}} treatment based on ethylene enriched activated carbon (TIFBio). Pineapple {{is an important}} export crop for tropical countries. The {{flower induction}} treatments {{are essential to the}} pineapple production for economical and social reasons. For conventional agriculture, many chemicals are available but for organic farming ethylene is the only allowed product. A new flower induction method suited to small organic growers has been developed by the <b>Pesticides</b> <b>Initiative</b> <b>Programme</b> of the Coleacp funded by the European Development Fund. The trials conducted proved that the method reaches more than 80 % efficiency at 10 weeks for the different application methods evaluated. The wet application trials show a doses response effect as well as effect of the application replication at 2 days interval. The flowering rate culminates at 100 % after 8 weeks for the best results, obtained with the wet treatment at 250 mg per plant applied two times at 2 days interval. The different dry treatments tested gave all 85 – 90 % flowering rates at 10 weeks, suggesting the presence of an undetermined limitation factor in the conditions prevailing for the trial. The time of application during the day shows no significant effect. It is concluded that the growers can use the TIFBio technique for production control. It is recommended to evaluate the most suited application technique according to their particular case as environmental effect can affect the efficiency...|$|E

We apply two main microeconometric techniques, difference-in-difference and matching difference-in-differences {{to identify the}} effect of the <b>Pesticides</b> <b>Initiative</b> Program on exports of fresh fruits and vegetables. We use a unique firm-level dataset containing data on sales, employment, and exports by product and destination markets, as well as firm enrolment year, over 2000 - 2008. The results suggest that while the program had no significant effect on exports pooled over all products and destinations, it had a positive effect when considering fresh fruits and vegetables exports to the European Union.

40|$|The {{family of}} aminopyralid {{herbicides}} {{is the newest}} part of the Dow AgroSciences portfolio. Aminopyralid is a pyridine carboxylic acid active ingredient that provides systemic control of target species with good tolerance of cool- and warm-season grasses. Aminopyralid products are postemergence herbicides that control the entire plant, including the roots, and offer soil residual activity to extend control. Aminopyralid also provides preemergence weed control on many susceptible weeds, including some that are not susceptible to foliar applications. In addition, aminopyralid has very low toxicity to birds, fish, mammals and aquatic invertebrates. Because of this and other factors, Milestone ® VM specialty herbicide was accepted for review and registration under the Reduced Risk <b>Pesticide</b> <b>Initiative</b> of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency — a program designed for compounds that demonstrate less risk to humans and the environment than market standards. The family of aminopyralid herbicides {{is an important part}} of any vegetation manager’s program that includes weed, vine and brush control...|$|R
