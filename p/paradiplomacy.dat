Duchacek points out a distinction between: a) cross-border regional microdiplomacy, b) transregional microdiplomacy and c) global <b>paradiplomacy,</b> to describe: a) contacts between non-central units situated across borders in different states, b) contacts between non-central units without a common border but situated in neighboring states and c) contacts between units belonging to states without common borders.

40|$|Cultural {{diplomacy}} is usually {{defined as an}} artistic and intellectual exchanges policy developed within Nation-States. During {{the last three decades}} we saw the proliferation of diverse external cultural policies structures of subnational governments all around the world. This can be explained because of the restructuration of postfordist State, the appearance of new actors and the development of multiple schemes of multilevel governance. However, the rupture of central governments monopoly in the area supposes a challenge for the development of new representation systems of States abroad. In Spain case, the significant decentralization of public administration since democratic transition permitted the emergence of cultural <b>paradiplomacies</b> of autonomic governments. This work analyses this process by studying the cases of General Administration of State and Catalan Autonomic Community and seek to explain how the abroad cultural action of the State of Autonomies is configured. In this regard, this article shows the inexistence of a federal system of cultural diplomacy. By contrast, it demonstrates the presence of an ntergovernmental competition in which processes of nation building are opposed and where legitimacy and monopoly of exterior cultural projection are on debat...|$|R

50|$|In strict sense, China {{does not}} engage in <b>paradiplomacy.</b> In spite of the active role Chinese provincial, {{municipal}} and district leaders play on the diplomatic field, these government officials do not act on behalf of local political groups or from a merely “local” perspective.

5000|$|Although {{the term}} [...] "paradiplomacy" [...] would be casually {{employed}} in the 1980s, it was introduced into the academic debate by the Canadian scholar Panayotis Soldatos. The American author Ivo Duchacek further developed the concept {{and became one of}} its main theoreticians. Other current denominations for <b>paradiplomacy</b> and related concepts are: [...] "multilayered diplomacy", [...] "substate diplomacy" [...] and [...] "intermestic affairs". This latter concept expresses a growing trend to the internationalization of domestic issues, which takes local and regional concerns to the centre stage of international affairs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Paradiplomacy</b> is {{international}} relations conducted by subnational or regional governments on their own, {{with a view}} to promoting their own interests. With globalisation, non-state regions play an increasingly influential international role.

40|$|The article centres on {{research}} into <b>paradiplomacy,</b> the international involvement of sub-national units. It aims at finding appropriate concepts {{for use in}} research into the <b>paradiplomacy</b> of Czech regions. The main international scholarship on <b>paradiplomacy</b> is reviewed and the most popular concepts and typologies are introduced. Subsequently, several contradictions and deficiencies are revealed. Then, contemporary research into <b>paradiplomacy</b> in the Czech Republic is summarized. The article argues that Czech research has already identified genuine regional <b>paradiplomacy,</b> but lacks definition with respect to its specifics. The main argument is that, although it was appropriate to apply some concepts from research into federal states for the identification of <b>paradiplomacy,</b> extensive use of these concepts and typologies cannot bring results in research into the content of Czech <b>paradiplomacy.</b> Thus, a step back is suggested. Brian Hocking’s approach, which perceives non-central governments as genuine actors of international politics, is suggested. Keating’s typology seems the most appropriate for empirical research. In addition, {{it is argued that}} further research should focus mainly on the content of the <b>paradiplomacy</b> of Czech regions. The final part of the article proposes the application of such a research strategy on the example of the South Moravian Region.

40|$|<b>Paradiplomacy</b> {{can be a}} {{difficult}} subject to discuss, not least because there is sometimes an understandable reluctance to admit that one is engaging in it. The topic of what <b>paradiplomacy</b> is, how it is undertaken, and why it might be important has been studied in the article. It has also been considered why national governments might be opposed {{to the practice of}} <b>paradiplomacy</b> by their subnational jurisdictions. Only understanding of what <b>paradiplomacy</b> actually entails, we can see what it can and it can’t offer to localities and regions that are pursuing greater self-determination. As the structure of governance in Europe and {{the world as a whole}} becomes to be more complex, new opportunities of creating subnational jurisdictions to increase their powers of self-determination are arising. (Bartmann, 2000; Keating, 1999). For some of them the full independence might be the ultimate ideal, while for others the increased power might be an end in itself. In such case, the <b>paradiplomacy</b> shows a path toward gaining greater standing and influence in the international community. It is not a path, however, that will lead to success in any way, and in some cases <b>paradiplomacy</b> can actually hinder a jurisdiction’s quest for greater international recognition. In addition, a policy instrument is good not only by the policies it advances, but the effective <b>paradiplomacy</b> holds out the ability to overcome effectively bad results, which are particular risky in the case of subnational jurisdictions lacking substantial prior experience on the world stage. <b>Paradiplomacy</b> has been defined as «a political entity’s extra-jurisdictional activation targeting foreign political entities». As <b>paradiplomacy</b> is the specific example of political interaction between unequal partners, which exists outside the internationally accepted political sphere, it is a contested practice by its nature. It has been argued in the article that subnational jurisdictions and sovereign states have absolutely differing policy objectives and that <b>paradiplomacy</b> is the best possibility to achieve policy’s objectives as it allows either to slip beneath the political radar of sovereign states or to acquire the de facto concession of sovereign states. That’s why the more sophisticated paradiplomatic tools (such as pseudo-embassies) are not always more effective in achieving policy objectives than the less sophisticated tools (such as participation in international networks) are. Successful paradiplomatic practice requires a balance of developing political structures and setting concrete policy objectives. The aims of subnational jurisdictions, which want bigger autonomy or independence, can be furthered through the implementation of stronger networks of similar subnational jurisdictions in Europe and all over the world...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the main findings which are focusing interdisciplinary on contemporary {{trends in the}} regional policy in Central Europe. These findings are illustrated on regional policy activities in Znojmo region which is a pioneer in so called <b>paradiplomacy</b> activities.

These results are obtained by using classical theory of <b>paradiplomacy</b> from Ivo Duchacek and Panayotis Soldatos.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the international}} environmental relations undertaken by subnational governments, a phenomenon conceptualised as environmental <b>paradiplomacy.</b> Research on <b>paradiplomacy</b> examines subnational governments’ international relations without considering their engagement with environmental issues, while multilevel governance (MLG) theory focuses on the rescaling of governance of environmental problems without addressing subnational engagement in international relations. Combining <b>paradiplomacy</b> studies and MLG theory, the thesis develops an original conceptual framework to investigate a leading example of environmental <b>paradiplomacy.</b> The conceptual framework {{is applied to the}} case of the state of São Paulo, a regional government in Brazil that, since the 1970 s, has strongly engaged in international environmental activities. In contrast with other findings on <b>paradiplomacy,</b> the state of São Paulo engages in international relations not only as a way of challenging, but also of collaborating with the national government. The major empirical data informing the thesis was gathered through participant observation and semi-structured interviews with key figures involved with environmental governance in the state and at the national level, as well as representatives from NGOs, universities, the private sector and foreign policy-makers. The study furthers the understanding of <b>paradiplomacy</b> offering analytical insight into: (1) how subnational governments engage in transnational relations; (2) the reasons driving them to undertake paradiplomacy; and (3) the outcomes of their actions. It also contributes more generally to research on global environmental governance, offering new theoretical insights on the roles of subnational governments and the changing relationships between different levels of government in national and international policymaking...|$|E

In this context the paper discusses the implications of the <b>paradiplomacy</b> of sub-national governments to the foreign policies of central governments and argues that not only <b>paradiplomacy</b> does not present a risk to the coherence of foreign policy but constitutes a major factor for the consolidation of the soft power of states...|$|E

Second, it asserts that—unlike other Westphalian states—the Chinese government has recognized the benefits of <b>paradiplomacy</b> as a way to enhance the structural competitiveness of its borderland provinces in the regional economy. In doing so, it has proactively deployed provincial authorities in the multilevel governance of the GMS Program.

To answer questions about the influence of national diplomacy over a region's <b>paradiplomacy,</b> and the possibility to conduct independent <b>paradiplomacy</b> in an authoritarian state, speeches given on topics related to Turkey by the President of Tatarstan Rustam Minnikhanov were analysed against the background of the changing Russian relations to Turkey, using the Critical Discourse Analysis. The analysis revealed that although Tatarstani <b>paradiplomacy</b> reflects the developments of Russian diplomacy - it is not possible not to, since the decisions of the Federal government are binding for its subjects - President Minnikhanov continued to advocate for a long-term (and as close as possible) cooperation with Turkey regardless of Moscow's current stance.

40|$|The {{research}} {{analyzed the}} features of the processes of regionalization, which emerged and intensified in response to a multifaceted globalization. It was revealed that increasing the power of regional communities in the international arena resulted in emergence and development of such phenomenon as <b>paradiplomacy,</b> which finds itself in intensification of regional activities in international organizations and supranational entities. An important place in the article was given to the <b>paradiplomacy</b> concept analysis, considering that this concept is relatively new in the world of political science and is practically not used in the scientific language of our country. The research defined the basic approaches and mechanisms of actors’ activities in <b>paradiplomacy</b> to mobilize regional resources in order to implement initiatives to ensure the interests of the regions and their citizens in various fields. Special attention was paid to the specifics of <b>paradiplomacy</b> implementation by the example of functioning of the European Union, as long as its successful experience allows talking about the formation of the «Europe of Regions». The research analyzed major actors’ activities in <b>paradiplomacy</b> at subnational and regional levels, which are created within the cross-border cooperation. It is no coincidence that the emphasis in the article was made on the cross-border cooperation, because it allows local authorities to develop and successfully implement comprehensive economic, cultural and humanitarian programs, deal with security issues, local employment and provide health care at the appropriate level. The author paid special attention to the analysis of scientific publications devoted to the specific problems of functioning of paradiplomatic institutions in the modern world, especially in the Europe. In particular, the author examined the works of such scientists as T. Zonova, A. Kuznetsov, T. Malloy. The special place in the article was given to justify the thesis on the feasibility of intensification of paradiplomatic activity in Ukraine that will involve local communities into more active participation in the work of international and regional organizations, various programs and projects aimed at establishing cooperation with cross-border areas. The author asserted that the role of paradiplomatic activity will increase, because its emergence and functioning is an object lesson how the states and regions can reach an agreement in distribution of power authorization. The author justified the thesis that the regions with extensive legislative powers and autonomy generally develop diversified external activities more successfully and actively (some regions in Germany, France, and Great Britain). The research outlined promising areas of application of paradiplomatic activity in contemporary international relations...|$|E

40|$|D. Litt. et Phil. (Politics) South Africa’s 1996 Constitution makes {{provision}} for relatively autonomous provincial administrations, which share responsibility {{with the national}} government for important functional areas while also exercising exclusive authority over others. Although the Constitution is not explicit {{on the distribution of}} foreign policy competence, the dominant interpretation among South African policy-makers is that this functional area is the exclusive domain of the national government. Consequently, the foreign policy-making process in the country has over the years been dominated by the national executive. Even so, since 1995 the interplay of a set of push and pull factors has encouraged all provinces to assume an active and direct international role, to the extent that provincial international relations or <b>paradiplomacy</b> has become an important feature of South Africa’s international relations. This study examines the <b>paradiplomacy</b> of the South African provinces of Gauteng, the North West and the Western Cape against the backdrop of a relatively weak scholarly and public discourse of the phenomenon in the country. Through an in-depth and empirically based analysis of the three case studies, the inquiry generates insight into the nature and meaning of <b>paradiplomacy</b> in South Africa, as a contribution to the development of alternative accounts of a phenomenon whose scholarship is still heavily dominated by Western perspectives. The study finds that <b>paradiplomacy</b> has evolved in South Africa as a predominantly functional project, which has little significance for the authority of the national government over the country’s foreign policy and international relations. The provincial governments in Gauteng, the North West and the Western Cape engage in international relations primarily as a strategy to harness the opportunities of globalisation and economic interdependence, {{in the interest of the}} socio-economic development of their respective jurisdictions. This ‘developmental paradiplomacy’ is conditioned to a large extent by the limited provincial powers on foreign affairs, strong centripetal forces in South Africa’s political system, as well as the pervasive influence of the post-apartheid discourse on socio-economic transformation. Thus, although all three provinces examined conduct their international relations with relative autonomy and in ways that have at times undermined the country’s international reputation and attracted Pretoria’s ire, these activities are consciously defined within the framework of the country’s foreign policy and, in some cases, are executed in close collaboration with the national government. In a sense, therefore, provinces conceive of their international role as that of agents or champions of Pretoria’s foreign policy agenda. The key findings of this study, especially as they pertain to the nature and significance of <b>paradiplomacy</b> in South Africa, highlight the North-South geopolitical cleavage in the manifestation of the phenomenon. On the one hand, the South African case resonates with the experience in other developing countries like India, China, Malaysia and Argentina, where <b>paradiplomacy</b> evolves under the shadow of national foreign policy processes. On the other hand, the findings contrast with the experience in most countries in Europe and North America where questions of nationalism, sub-national identity and the sovereign authority for international representation have contributed to defining the international agency of sub-national governments...|$|E

One of {{the less}} often {{discussed}} features of multinational societies is the effort of their constituent segments to become active internationally. Regional governments developing a foreign policy and conducting international relations, a phenomenon sometimes called ‘paradiplomacy’, {{is not unique to}} multinational societies; however, it is in this type of societies that the international activity of regions is most intense. This article argues that this is because <b>paradiplomacy</b> is primarily a function of stateless nationalism. It suggests that the processes of nationalism (identity construction, interest definition/articulation and political-territorial mobilization) logically lead to regional governments seeking the development of an international personality, and specifies the theoretical links. It argues that <b>paradiplomacy</b> serves as a means for identity- and nation-building; that it sustains and promotes specific interest definitions such as cultural preservation; and that the inter-governments conflicts it involves provides opportunities for political-territorial mobilization. The article also suggests that the link between nationalism and <b>paradiplomacy</b> is conditioned by domestic and international opportunity structures: institutional and constitutional contexts; national representational arrangements and foreign policy agenda; continental regimes; the structure of the international system; and so on. In other words, structural contexts can provide opportunity for action for, and impose constraints on, regions, and therefore shape the ability of segments of multinational societies to operate on the international scene. These theoretical arguments will be highlighted using the case study of the Basque Country. The empirical analysis draws from statements about international relations contained in the programmes of Basque nationalist parties. Peer reviewe...|$|E
