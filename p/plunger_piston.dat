Motorcycles of BMW K100 series were optionally equipped with the ABS, which added 11 kg to the bike. It was developed together with FAG Kugelfischer and regulated the pressure in the braking circuits via a <b>plunger</b> <b>piston.</b> Japanese manufacturers followed with an ABS option by 1992 on the Honda ST1100 and the Yamaha FJ1200.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{modeling}} {{is based}} on the statistical methods of the experimental designs; its fundamental role is to analyze the experimental data processing. This is effective for the study of process which contains several independent variables. In this cask, parameters vary simultaneously according to the experimental design, contrary to the Newtonian method. The factors studied can have two, three or several levels according to the conditions of experiments and the measuring accuracy. Usually, these factors have various measuring units; this is why the experimental design is made up {{on the basis of the}} coded values. Applications were carried out on an injection pump of the diesel engine having used <b>plunger</b> <b>pistons.</b> This pump is regarded as very important body in the diesel engine and plays a capital part in its operation. The wear of this <b>plunger</b> <b>pistons</b> which is abrasive nature, has a very harmful impact on the techniques and economic indices of the engine. The aim of this study is to evaluate how the wear of the elements of the injection pump on combustion. Experiments were carried out, by simultaneously varying parameters considered to be influential, to lead to the modeling of the provided pressure and the feeding coefficient...|$|R
50|$|Piston SystemsThe {{pressure}} release {{in this system}} is realized through movement of a spring-tensioned piston. When pressure should be released, a linear motor pulls back the <b>plunger</b> <b>piston</b> and opens up more space for the fluid. The system was used for example in the ABS I (1988) and ABS II (1993) of BMW. The ABS II differed in size and an electronically controlled friction clutch was mounted on the shaft instead of a plunger. Further displacement sensors record the travel distance of the piston to allow the control unit a more precise regulation. Honda also uses this system of pressure modulation for big sports and touring bikes.|$|E
50|$|A burette (also buret) is a {{laboratory}} equipment used in analytical chemistry for the dispensing of variable, and for measuring amount {{of a chemical}} solution. It is a long glass tube with taper end that are attached with a stopcock at {{the opposite of the}} terminal valve. The flow of liquid from the tube to the burette tip is controlled by the stopcock valve.  In General Chemistry lab, the burette utilized a 50-mL volume with a stopcock without lubrication. Mainly, {{there are two types of}} Burette which are volumetric burette and Piston burette or Digital burette. A volumetric burette delivers measured volumes of liquid. Piston burettes are similar to syringes, but with a precision bore and a <b>plunger.</b> <b>Piston</b> burettes may be manually operated or may be motorized. A weight burette delivers measured weights of liquid.|$|E
40|$|Key words: laser cladding; MoS 2; {{self-lubricating}} coating; microstructure; {{friction and}} wear Abstract. Ni/MoS 2 composite coatings with different content of MoS 2 were produced {{on the surface}} of 1045 steel by laser cladding technology. SEM and EPMA were used to analyze the microstructures and micro area compositions of the coatings. Dry friction and wear properties of the coatings were tested by friction and wear tester. The results indicate that the microstructures of Ni/MoS 2 composite coating are large quantities of different-form white silicides and black sulfides distributing on the substrate. The sulfides mainly consist of CrxSy, MoS 2 and FeS. When the content of MoS 2 is 9 %, Ni/MoS 2 composite coating exhibits best tribological properties.

40|$|A {{resonant}} pick-up for {{the detection}} of heavy ion Schottky noise was built into the ESR storage ring at GSI. A similar device will be installed at the cooler storage ring CSRe at IMP. Its purpose is a significant enhancement of the signal to noise ratio of Schottky spectra. A particular application of the new system is the measurement of circulating single ions. The resonator is based on a pillbox design. It is operated at air pressure, and is electromagnetically coupled to the vacuum tube of the storage ring via a cylinder-shaped ceramic gap. The resonant frequency can be changed by inserting <b>plunger</b> <b>pistons.</b> The resonator can easily be decoupled from the storage ring, if high beam impedances become a problem.

50|$|Seals are an {{integral}} part of <b>piston</b> pumps and <b>plunger</b> pumps to separate the power fluid from the media that is being pumped. A stuffing box or packing is used to seal the joint between the vessel where the media is transferred and the <b>plunger</b> or <b>piston.</b> A stuffing box may be composed of bushings, packing or seal rings, and a gland.|$|R
40|$|Composite {{material}} and plunger-cast pipe manufacturing method and system wherein the composite material includes waste, chemically unmodified PET material, {{one or more}} waste filler materials (e. g. rock crusher fines, lime sludge or waste coal combustion by-products), and fiber reinforcement (e. g. glass, metal, ceramic, carbon, organic, and polymer fibers) and wherein the PET material is melted and mixed in a container to disperse filler {{material and}} fiber reinforcement in the PET material. The resulting mixture can be formed into a tubular pipe shape using the plunger-cast manufacturing method and system wherein a <b>plunger</b> <b>piston</b> and inner collapsible mold are pushed into the melted composite material contained in an outer mold.

30|$|The flange sealing {{structure}} {{was used in}} a core holder under high temperature and high pressure. The overall upstream and downstream <b>plunger</b> <b>pistons</b> were located in the chamber for confining pressure test, so that the end face of a rock was effectively contacted with the piston of the holder. Using the flexible graphite to seal the confining pressure in the rock samples and holder overcomes the shortage of traditional equipments that they cannot be applied for testing at high temperature when rubber is used for sealing. Furthermore, the copper casing subjected to thermal treatment in the vacuum was used to isolate the rock samples and confining pressure, which can effectively transfer confining pressure and reliably resist high temperature and pressure, so as to work continuously. The pore pressure and confining pressure were loaded by utilizing the EDC servo control system, which can automatically control the pressure. When pore pressure or confining pressure changed, the servo control system was able to compensate pressure, so that pressure was maintained at a certain value and did not change with temperature or other conditions.|$|R
50|$|Depending {{on how the}} {{displacement}} principle is implemented, a distinction can be drawn between rotary and reciprocating pumps. The rotary circulation pumps includes eccentric screw pumps, centrifugal pumps, and squeezed tube (peristaltic) pumps. Reciprocating pumps include <b>plunger,</b> diaphragm, and <b>piston</b> pumps.|$|R
50|$|The {{cataract}} itself {{resembled a}} small plunger pump. It was an iron box in a cistern filled with water, with a <b>plunger</b> or <b>piston</b> {{set in the}} top and pressed downwards by a weight. The water within the pump could only escape through a small tap or valve. As the plunger gradually fell, its motion was passed upwards by a rocking lever and a rod to the valvegear in the middle chamber. Once the rod had risen sufficiently, this opened the first valve to admit steam into {{the upper part of}} the cylinder, beginning a new stroke.|$|R
5000|$|Rotary <b>piston</b> and <b>plunger</b> pumps use a crank {{mechanism}} {{to create a}} reciprocating motion along an axis, which then builds pressure in a cylinder or working barrel to force gas or fluid through the pump. The pressure in the chamber actuates the valves at both the suction and discharge points. Plunger pumps are used in applications that could range from [...] Piston pumps are used in lower pressure applications. The volume of the fluid discharged {{is equal to the}} area of the <b>plunger</b> or <b>piston,</b> multiplied by its stroke length. The overall capacity of the <b>piston</b> pumps and <b>plunger</b> pumps can be calculated with the area of the <b>piston</b> or <b>plunger,</b> the stroke length, the number of <b>pistons</b> or <b>plungers</b> and the speed of the drive. The power needed from the drive is proportional to the pressure and capacity of the pump.|$|R
50|$|Reciprocating pumps {{move the}} fluid using {{one or more}} {{oscillating}} <b>pistons,</b> <b>plungers,</b> or membranes (diaphragms), while valves restrict fluid motion to the desired direction. In order for suction to take place, the pump must first pull the plunger in an outward motion to decrease pressure in the chamber. Once the plunger pushes back, it will increase the pressure chamber and the inward pressure of the plunger will then open the discharge valve and release the fluid into the delivery pipe at a high velocity.|$|R
50|$|Hand {{pumps are}} {{manually}} operated pumps; they use human power and mechanical advantage to move fluids or air {{from one place}} to another. They are widely used in {{every country in the world}} for a variety of industrial, marine, irrigation and leisure activities. There are many different types of hand pump available, mainly operating on a piston, diaphragm or rotary vane principle with a check valve on the entry and exit ports to the chamber operating in opposing directions. Most hand pumps have <b>plungers</b> or reciprocating <b>pistons,</b> and are positive displacement.|$|R
50|$|The AEGs were {{developed}} in Japan and the Japanese company Tokyo Marui is credited with creating the original gearbox system. In a Tokyo Marui AEG, the motor drives a train of 3 gears mounted inside a gearbox, which then loads a pump piston against a spring. Once the spring is released, it pushes the <b>piston</b> <b>plunger</b> forward through the pump cylinder to propel a pellet resting within the chamber forward through the barrel {{and out of the}} muzzle. Many manufacturers have now more or less replicated this basic model, adding reinforced parts or minor improvements.|$|R

40|$|As water {{hydraulics}} is {{more and}} more highlighted in wide applications, many varieties of research on design, materials and manufacturing methods of water hydraulic components have been carried out. Especially, water hydraulic piston pump used to be the subject of study in relation to its relative sliding movement. In these relative sliding parts, the leakage and friction probably took place because of the characteristics of low viscosity and poor lubrication of water. In order to reduce the leakage and friction, the relative sliding parts are filled up nearly by using engineering plastic as an anti-wear material on sliding parts. Compared with an oil hydraulic system, a water hydraulic system has fundamental disadvantages of large friction, high leakage, high wear, corrosion, etc. A mechanism of rod type piston was considered to reduce friction of the piston's movement in a water hydraulic piston pump. Friction and leakage of the rod type piston was analyzed and compared with those properties of the conventional <b>plunger</b> type <b>piston.</b> An experimental device was set up to evaluate friction and leakage of those pistons. A PEEK piston was also tested as another alternative piston of a water hydraulic pump...|$|R
50|$|Despite their drawbacks, {{peristaltic}} pumps have so {{far been}} the industry standard for dispensing large volumes of laboratory media: {{they are capable of}} dispensing fluid continuously from a reservoir into any number of receptacles, can be used for coarse, thick, or gritty fluids as well as free-flowing thin ones, and unlike many of the other dispenser types, the only contact the pumped fluid has during delivery is with the tubing in which it is being transported: there is never any contact with an internal <b>piston,</b> <b>plunger,</b> or diaphragm, which ensures the highest degrees of sterility and precludes virtually any chemical cross contamination. However, their functionality is limited to the flexible lifetime of this tubing which must be able to withstand hundreds of thousands of compressions without losing integrity; their fluid delivery is pulsed; variation in the flexibility of the tubing means they are among the least precise forms of dispenser; the tubing in a peristaltic pump may rupture unexpectedly— many pumps include shielding to help contain the ruptured fluids, but a rupture can ruin a carefully timed lab procedure and/ or damage {{the inner workings of the}} pump itself; few other pump types are more dependent on a microprocessor or more useless in the event of mechanical failure; they along with syringe pumps constitute the most expensive dispensers on the market.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} performance curves for a variety of positive displacement pumps in order to select an efficient and low cost option for use as a boiler feed pump in a 1 -kWe organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system built by the Solar Turbine Group in Lesotho. The pumps tested included OEM <b>plunger</b> and <b>piston</b> pumps, and rotary vane-type power steering pumps purchased from a junk yard. Motor speed and torque were measured at different flow rates to determine the power consumed to move fluid in the prescribed pressure regime. The test station was designed to pump deionized water; it was intended that measurements and calculations would then be non-dimensionalized and used to predict the ORC working fluid's properties. Unfortunately, deionized water caused the power steering pump shafts to seize; the efficiencies were below anticipated and the pumps were unable to operate under the specified pressures. It was discovered, after WD- 40 was added to the water, that power steering pumps performed best when moving fluids with more lubricity. The optimal pump was selected based on how the pump efficiency affected the overall ORC system efficiency, defined as the electrical work output divided by the heat input, and the net electric power output. Power steering pumps achieved efficiencies between 34 %- 54 % under the desired ORC operating conditions with water-oil emulsion as the working fluid. For that pump efficiency range, the overall solar thermal electric ORC system efficiency would be 7. 4 %- 8. 5 % and the overall system cost would be USD 4. 59 - 5. 27 per installed Watt. Made specifically for pumping hydroflurorcarbons, the working fluid used in STG's ORC, the OEM Dynex pump exhibited poorer performance than predicted. The pump efficiency of 31 % gave a system efficiency of 7. 1 % and a cost of USD 6. 40 per installed Watt. The OEM water <b>piston</b> and <b>plunger</b> pumps made by Hypro achieved efficiencies of 70 % and 81 %, respectively, under the same ORC operating conditions described above. (cont) For those pump efficiencies, the overall system efficiencies would be 9. 0 % and 9. 2 % and the costs would be USD 4. 58 and 4. 63 per installed Watt, respectively. The most optimal pump is the HyproPiston pump; although it costs nearly six times that of a power steering pump, the overall system cost is lower when normalized over the power output. by Cynthia Lin.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the knowledge and the characterization of micro Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC). It is based on experimental data and simulation models. An oil-free scroll expander is tested {{in a wide range}} of operating conditions in order to better characterize its performance. Particular attention is paid to the tightness of the machine which is obtained using a magnetic coupling. The measured isentropic efficiency reaches 75 % which is higher than typical values reported in the literature. From the experimental results, a performance map of the expander is generated. This performance map can be used to provide fast and accurate calculation of the volumetric and isentropic performance of the expander {{in a wide range of}} operating conditions. Five displacement pumps adapted to μ-ORC systems are also tested. These pumps are diaphragm, <b>piston,</b> <b>plunger</b> and gear types. The measured values include the overall efficiency, the volumetric efficiency and the NPSH. A deep analysis of the performance is performed to quantify the losses of each pump, of their electric motor and of their frequency drive. This analysis shows that the weakness of the overall effectiveness (max. 46 %) of the pumps tested is mainly due to the low efficiency of the electric motor. A semi-empirical model of the diaphragm pump is proposed and validated based on manufacturer data. This model can predict the mechanical power of the pump and the flow delivered with a good accuracy. The simulation models developed for the expander and the pump are used to simulate a configuration including the pump, the generator and the expander on a single shaft. This configuration aims to avoid the use of a motor and a frequency drive whose performance is poor in the range of power consumed by the pump of a μ-ORC system. The results show a significant increase in the net power produced using the integrated configuration Finally, performance of a prototype of μ-ORC suitable for recovering heat from a two-stage screw compressor are measured and analyzed. The prototype allows generating maximum 3. 9 % of the electrical power consumed by the compressor. Several optimization options of the prototype are evaluated numerically, showing that the power generation could be increased up to 5. 4 % of the compressor consumption. These options include using the integrated configuration and optimizing the intercooler boiler design...|$|R
