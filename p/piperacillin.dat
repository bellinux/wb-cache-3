5000|$|<b>Piperacillin</b> is a broad-spectrum β-lactam {{antibiotic}} of the ureidopenicillin class. The {{chemical structure}} of <b>piperacillin</b> and other ureidopenicillins incorporates a polar side chain that enhances penetration into Gram negative bacteria and reduces susceptibility to cleavage by Gram negative beta lactamase enzymes. These properties confer activity against the important hospital pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus <b>piperacillin</b> is {{sometimes referred to}} as an [...] "anti-pseudomonal penicillin".|$|E

50|$|<b>Piperacillin</b> is not absorbed orally, {{and must}} {{therefore}} be given by intravenous or intramuscular injection. It {{has been shown that}} the bactericidal actions of the drug do not increase with concentrations of <b>piperacillin</b> higher than 4-6 x MIC, which means that the drug is concentration-independent in terms of its actions. <b>Piperacillin</b> has instead shown to offer higher bactericidal activity when its concentration remains above the MIC {{for longer periods of time}} (50% time>MIC showing the highest activity). This higher activity present in continuous dosing has not been directly linked to clinical outcomes, but however does show promise of lowering possibility of resistance and decreasing mortality.|$|E

50|$|When used alone, <b>piperacillin</b> lacks strong {{activity}} {{against the}} Gram positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, as the beta-lactam ring is hydrolyzed by the bacteria's beta-lactamase.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{typically}} includes multiple {{antibiotics and}} may include ceftazidime, doxycycline, <b>piperacillin,</b> meropenem, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole(co-trimoxazole). Although co-trimoxazole has been generally considered the {{drug of choice}} for B. cepacia infections, ceftazidime, doxycycline, <b>piperacillin,</b> and meropenem {{are considered to be}} viable alternative options in cases where co-trimoxazole cannot be administered because of hypersensitivity reactions, intolerance, or resistance. In April 2007, researchers from the University of Western Ontario School of Medicine, working with a group from Edinburgh, announced that they had discovered a potential method to kill the organism, involving disruption in the biosynthesis of an essential cell membrane sugar.|$|E
50|$|Most Pseudomonas spp. are {{naturally}} resistant to penicillin {{and the majority}} of related beta-lactam antibiotics, but a number are sensitive to <b>piperacillin,</b> imipenem, ticarcillin, or ciprofloxacin. Aminoglycosides such as tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin are other choices for therapy.|$|E
50|$|Piperacillin/tazobactam is a {{combination}} antibiotic containing the extended-spectrum penicillin antibiotic <b>piperacillin</b> and the &beta;-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam. It is commercially available as Tazocin and Zosyn {{as well as a}} generic drug. The combination has activity against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.|$|E
50|$|Azlocillin is an acylampicillin {{antibiotic}} with {{an extended}} {{spectrum of activity}} and greater in vitro potency than the carboxy penicillins.Azlocillin is similar to mezlocillin and <b>piperacillin.</b> It demonstrates antibacterial activity against {{a broad spectrum of}} bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and, in contrast to most cephalosporins, exhibits activity against enterococci.|$|E
50|$|<b>Piperacillin</b> is used almost {{exclusively}} {{in combination with the}} beta lactamase inhibitor tazobactam for the treatment of serious, hospital-acquired infections. This combination is among the most widely used drug therapies in United States non-federal hospitals, accounting for $388M in spending in spite of being a low-cost generic drug.|$|E
50|$|Another {{development}} {{of the line of}} true penicillins was the antipseudomonal penicillins, such as carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and <b>piperacillin,</b> useful for their activity against Gram-negative bacteria. However, the usefulness of the β-lactam ring was such that related antibiotics, including the mecillinams, the carbapenems and, most important, the cephalosporins, still retain it at the center of their structures.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Piperacillin</b> is most {{commonly}} used {{in combination with the}} beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam (Piperacillin/Tazobactam) (tradename [...] "Zosyn" [...] or [...] "Tazocin"), which enhances piperacillin's effectiveness by inhibiting many beta lactamases to which it is susceptible. However, the co-administration of tazobactam does not confer activity against MRSA, as penicillins (and most other beta lactams) do not avidly bind to the penicillin-binding proteins of this pathogen.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{clinically}} approved {{treatment for}} pouchitis.First line treatment is usually with antibiotics, specifically with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Ampicillin or <b>Piperacillin</b> {{can also be}} considered as alternatives to empiric Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole). Administration of metronidazole at a high daily dose of 20 mg/kg can cause symptomatic peripheral neuropathology in up to 85% of patients. This can be a limiting factor in the use of maintenance metronidazole to suppress chronic pouchitis.|$|E
50|$|S. maltophilia {{is not a}} virulent {{organism}} {{and removal}} of the infected prosthesis is frequently sufficient to cure the infection; antibiotics are only required if the prosthesis cannot be removed. Many strains of S. maltophilia are sensitive to co-trimoxazole and ticarcillin, though resistance has been increasing. It is not usually susceptible to <b>piperacillin,</b> and susceptibility to ceftazidime is variable. Tigecycline is also an effective drug. Polymyxin B may be effective treatment, at least in vitro, though not without frequent adverse effects.|$|E
50|$|Penicillin is the {{treatment}} of choice for both disease states. It is resistant to vancomycin.E. rhusiopathiae is sensitive in vitro and in vivo mainly to penicillins, but also to cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), tetracyclines (chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline), quinolones (ciprofloxacin, pefloxacin), clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, and <b>piperacillin.</b> It is resistant to vancomycin, chloramphenicol, daptomycin, gentamicin, netilmicin, polymyxin B, streptomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Penicillins and cephalosporins are the first-line choicefor treatment.

5000|$|The {{available}} parenteral antimicrobials {{for most}} infections are metronidazole, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, cefoxitin, a penicillin (i.e. ticarcillin, ampicillin, <b>piperacillin)</b> and a beta-lactamase inhibitor (i.e. clavulanic acid, sulbactam, tazobactam), and a carbapenem (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, ertapenem). An antimicrobial effective against Gram-negative enteric bacilli (i.e. aminoglycoside) or an anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin (i.e. cefepime [...] ) are generally added to metronidazole, and occasionally cefoxitin when treating intra-abdominal infections to provide coverage for these organisms. Clindamycin {{should not be}} used as a single agent as empiric therapy for abdominal infections. Penicillin can be added to metronidazole in treating of intracranial, pulmonary and dental infections to provide coverage against microaerophilic streptococci, and Actinomyces.|$|E
50|$|The {{bacterium}} is {{susceptible to}} numerous disinfectants including benzalkonium chloride, iodine, mercuric chloride, potassium permanganate, 1% sodium hypochlorite, and ethanol. The micro-organism can also be destroyed by heating or ultraviolet light. Antibiotics such as streptomycin, amikacin, tetracycline, doxycycline, carbapenems, ceftazidime, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, <b>piperacillin,</b> chloramphenicol, and sulfathiazole {{have been reported to}} be effective against the bacteria in vitro. B. mallei, like B. pseudomallei, is also resistant to a number of antibiotics including aminoglycosides, polymyxins, and beta-lactams. No vaccine is currently available for humans or animals to protect against B. mallei infection. An animal model that will predict immune responses necessary to create immunity to the bacterium is needed before a vaccine can be developed. Mice are fairly close to humans in their susceptibility to B. mallei and would be the ideal choice of animal for creating a model for the vaccine.|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetic}} {{characteristics of}} <b>piperacillin</b> sodium were studied in five volunteers undergoing on-line hemodiafiltration (HDF). The subjects were given 2 g of <b>piperacillin</b> sodium intravenously over 1 min {{and placed on}} on-line HDF for 4 h starting at 60 min after the <b>piperacillin</b> infusion. Noncompartmental models were employed for estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters, and intradialytic <b>piperacillin</b> clearance was calculated by the recovery method. The mean volume of distribution and the elimination half-life were 0. 27 ± 0. 13 liter/kg (mean ± standard deviation) and 1. 1 ± 0. 6 h, respectively. The total body clearance of <b>piperacillin</b> was 0. 19 ± 0. 08 liter/h/kg. <b>Piperacillin</b> clearance through on-line HDF was 0. 11 ± 0. 06 liter/h/kg. The mean serum <b>piperacillin</b> concentration was 4. 0 ± 1. 9 μg/ml {{at the end of}} the 4 -h on-line HDF session. The concentration of infused <b>piperacillin</b> recovered in the dialysate was 527 ± 236 mg (26. 3 % ± 11. 8 %).

40|$|Seventy {{infants with}} {{suspected}} bacterial {{infection in the}} first 48 hours of life were treated either with <b>piperacillin</b> and flucloxacillin or with penicillin and gentamicin. Infection was confirmed and successfully eradicated in 6 of the 35 infants receiving <b>piperacillin</b> and flucloxacillin. Four infants treated with penicillin and gentamicin had confirmed infection and one deteriorated initially but then recovered when treated with <b>piperacillin.</b> Serum <b>piperacillin</b> concentrations above 100 mg/l and cerebrospinal fluid <b>piperacillin</b> concentrations of 2. 6 - 6 mg/l were noted for up to four hours and 7 hours respectively, {{even in the absence}} of inflamed meninges, after administration of <b>piperacillin</b> 100 mg/kg body weight intravenously. Median half life of <b>piperacillin</b> was 6. 5 hours and was prolonged in renal impairment. <b>Piperacillin</b> is considered to be a safe and effective first line single agent treatment for early neonatal infection but because some Escherichia coli are resistant to it we recommend that a second agent be used in critically ill infants with neutropenia or meningitis...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{antibacterial}} activity of <b>piperacillin</b> and cefuroxime against 180 isolates of cephalothin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and of <b>piperacillin</b> against 46 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was determined. Amikacin, gentamicin, carbenicillin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole were included for comparison. The activities of <b>piperacillin</b> and carbenicillin against Enterobacteriaceae were comparable. <b>Piperacillin</b> was appreciably more active against Pseudomonas than carbenicillin and was equivalent in activity to amikacin on a weight basis. The following beta-lactam agents {{were the most}} active against the indicated organisms (in parentheses) : cefoxitin (indole-positive Proteus spp.), cefuroxime and cefoxitin, (Klebsiella spp.), <b>piperacillin</b> (Enterobacter spp.), cefuroxime and cefoxitin (E. coli), <b>piperacillin</b> and cefoxitin (Serratia spp.), and cefoxitin (Providencia spp.).

40|$|Clavulanic {{acid and}} a penicillanic acid sulfone, when {{combined}} individually with <b>piperacillin,</b> synergistically inhibited various Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis. Clavulanic acid and <b>piperacillin</b> synergistically inhibited 91 of 170 (55 %) isolates tested. Synergy was most often found against piperacillin-resistant bacteria: 65 of 69 isolates (94 %). Although the penicillanic acid sulfone acted synergistically with <b>piperacillin,</b> inhibiting 62 of 170 strains (33 %), {{the concentration of}} clavulanic acid required for synergy generally was {{less than that of}} penicillanic acid sulfone. Combination of <b>piperacillin</b> and cefotaxime, an inhibitor of type 1 beta-lactamases, rarely was synergistic and was antagonistic for several species. The combination of <b>piperacillin</b> with potent beta-lactamase inhibitors made <b>piperacillin</b> active against those isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella and Bacteroides species, as well as selected other species, that are resistant to <b>piperacillin</b> by virtue of their production of beta-lactamases...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the in vitro activity of <b>piperacillin</b> {{alone or in}} combination with the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam against clinical isolates of Legionella species. At an inoculum of approximately 10 (4) CFU, tazobactam, <b>piperacillin,</b> and the 8 : 1 combination had equivalent activities against Legionella spp. At an approximately 10 -fold higher inoculum, the following results were obtained, expressed as MICs for 50 and 90 % of strains tested (MIC range) : <b>piperacillin,</b> 4 and 16 (0. 25 to 32) micrograms/ml; tazobactam, 0. 5 and 1 (0. 125 to 2) micrograms/ml; and piperacillin-tazobactam (expressed in terms of MIC of <b>piperacillin)</b> 0. 5 and 1 (0. 03 to 2) micrograms/ml.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Piperacillin</b> (and piperacillin/tazobactam) is a {{commonly}} prescribed antibiotic and {{is generally considered}} safe. We report a case of <b>piperacillin</b> induced bone marrow suppression.

After 21 days of treatment, he developed neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. These reversed promptly after stopping piperacillin/tazobactam. The time course of events suggested that <b>piperacillin</b> {{was the cause of}} bone marrow suppression in this patient. Conclusion Bone marrow suppression is a serious adverse effect of <b>piperacillin,</b> which should be kept in mind while treating patients with this drug. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} high-level <b>piperacillin</b> {{resistance in}} Veillonella spp. {{in the absence}} of β-lactamase activity. Methods: Penicillin-binding protein (PBP) competition studies were conducted in Veillonella strains, with <b>piperacillin</b> MICs ranging from 0. 5 to> 128 mg/L and ampicillin MICs from 0. 125 to 4 mg/L. Whole cell lysates were pre-incubated with <b>piperacillin</b> or ampicillin and post-labelled with [3 H]benzylpenicillin. Results: PBP competition studies showed that the PBP with greatest affinity for penicillin and ampicillin had a molecular weight of ∼ 66 kDa, and exhibited reduced binding of <b>piperacillin</b> in resistant strains. Conclusions: This unusual focusing of different penicillins on one PBP may be the cause of selective mutants resulting from <b>piperacillin</b> MICs> 128 mg/L. In the absence of β-lactamases, alterations in penicillin-binding were seen to be major contributors to high-level <b>piperacillin</b> resistance development...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of <b>piperacillin,</b> a new semisynthetic piperazine penicillin derivative, was evaluated against 626 clinical isolates and {{compared with the}} activity of other beta-lactam antibiotics. At a concentration of 0. 1 microgram/ml, <b>piperacillin</b> inhibited all streptococci except enterococci. Non-beta-lactamase-producing staphylococci were inhibited by 1. 6 microgram or less per ml. Both beta-lactamase- and non-beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus were inhibited by 0. 1 microgram/ml. <b>Piperacillin</b> inhibited non-beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Shigella at a concentration of 6. 3 micrograms/ml, but 20 % of strains of these species containing type III beta-lactamase were not inhibited by 100 micrograms/ml. <b>Piperacillin</b> at 25 micrograms/ml, inhibited 83 % of Citrobacter, 58 % of Klebsiella, 88 % of Enterobacter, and 50 % of indole-positive Proteus, Acinetobacter, and Providencia. At 25 micrograms/ml, <b>piperacillin</b> inhibited 95 % of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 78 % of Bacteroides fragilis. The minimal inhibitory concentration of <b>piperacillin</b> against Pseudomonas was affected by increasing the inoculum size and by pH. Minimum bactericidal concentrations against Pseudomonas and Serratia often were eightfold greater than the minimum inhibitory concentrations. <b>Piperacillin</b> was equal in activity to ampicillin against enterococci. It was more active than carbenicillin against E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Bacteroides. It was the most active penicillin against Pseudomonas and inhibited many strains of Pseudomonas for which the MICs of carbenicillin were above 200 micrograms/ml. <b>Piperacillin</b> was hydrolyzed by many different beta-lactamases. Synergistic activity of <b>piperacillin</b> was demonstrated when it was combined with amikacin, gentamicin, and cefazolin against P. aeruginosa {{and members of the}} Enterobacteriaceae. No antagonism was observed when <b>piperacillin</b> was combined with aminoglycosides; however, antagonism was observed rarely against E. coli when <b>piperacillin</b> was combined with cefazolin...|$|E
40|$|The minimal {{inhibitory}} {{concentrations of}} <b>piperacillin</b> and seven other betalactam antibiotics were determined against 407 bacterial isolates. <b>Piperacillin</b> {{was found to}} be more active than ampicillin against susceptible gram-negative bacilli and more active than either carbenicillin or ticarcillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococci. Although <b>piperacillin</b> was active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, this activity was less than that of the cephalosporins. <b>Piperacillin</b> was not active against penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacteriaceae that were resistant to the other test antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|<b>Piperacillin</b> {{is a new}} semisynthetic, expanded-spectrum {{penicillin}} with marked activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The {{biliary excretion}} of <b>piperacillin</b> was studied in patients undergoing cholecystectomy. Concentrations of <b>piperacillin</b> in common duct bile at 35 to 90 min postinfusion of 1 -g doses ranged from 31 to 920 micrograms/ml, with a mean (+/- standard deviation) of 467 +/- 363 micrograms/ml. Gallbladder <b>piperacillin</b> levels at 30 to 75 min postinfusion ranged from 2. 2 to 80 micrograms/ml, {{with a mean of}} 27 +/- 31 micrograms/ml. No correlation occurred with peak serum level of antibiotic, creatinine, bilirubin, or alkaline phosphatase. Significant amounts of <b>piperacillin</b> were excreted via the biliary system...|$|E
40|$|Susceptibility to <b>piperacillin</b> {{was similar}} to that to piperacillin-tazobactam (< 1 % difference) for 6, 938 {{isolates}} of Enterobacter aerogenes and 13, 954 isolates of Enterobacter cloacae tested using a Vitek system; for the same species, in contrast, susceptibility rates to piperacillin-tazobactam were 5. 9 to 13. 9 % higher than to <b>piperacillin</b> using disk diffusion, MicroScan, and Vitek 2 testing. Unprecedented phenotypes (<b>piperacillin</b> susceptible and piperacillin-tazobactam intermediate; <b>piperacillin</b> intermediate and piperacillin-tazobactam resistant; <b>piperacillin</b> susceptible and piperacillin-tazobactam resistant) accounted for 6. 1 % of the results for E. aerogenes isolates and 6. 0 % of the results for E. cloacae isolates tested with the Vitek system...|$|E
40|$|The {{protective}} effect of <b>piperacillin</b> against the nephrotoxicity of cephaloridine and gentamicin was examined in experimental animals. In rabbits, <b>piperacillin</b> was infused at {{a dose of}} 1 mg/kg (body weight) per min over 225 min and cephaloridine (300 mg/kg) was intravenously administered as a bolus 45 min {{after the start of}} a drip infusion. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) in urine were measured as the renal toxicological parameters before and 24 h after cephaloridine dosing. Although the single administration of cephaloridine significantly elevated these parameters, the elevation was prevented by the concomitant administration of <b>piperacillin.</b> The {{protective effect}} of <b>piperacillin</b> was superior to those of cephalothin and fosfomycin. In rats, <b>piperacillin</b> (1, 000 mg/kg) was intravenously administered and immediately followed by the intramuscular administration of gentamicin (100 mg/kg) every 24 h for 5 days. When <b>piperacillin</b> was concomitantly administered with gentamicin, the elevations of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and urinary NAG were significantly lower than when gentamicin was given alone. The concomitant administration of <b>piperacillin</b> resulted in a significant protective effect against the nephrotoxicity of cephaloridine in rabbits and of gentamicin in rats. Histopathological observation also supported the protective effect of <b>piperacillin.</b> The protective mechanism of <b>piperacillin</b> might be the inhibition of transport from the peritubular side to tubular cells for cephaloridine and from both the peritubular and luminal sides for gentamicin...|$|E
40|$|<b>Piperacillin,</b> a new semisynthetic penicillin, was {{compared}} with other semisynthetic penicillins, cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides by the agar dilution method against 3, 600 isolates of facultative gram-negative bacilli, Bacteroides fragilis, and enterococci. At 64 μg/ml, <b>piperacillin</b> inhibited 90 % of the isolates in each group of organisms tested except for Escherichia coli (83 % inhibited by 64 μg/ml). Compared with carbenicillin, <b>piperacillin</b> had a 16 -fold increase in activity by weight against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the enterococcus, an 8 -fold increase against Serratia marcescens, and a 4 -fold increase against B. fragilis and Enterobacter species. <b>Piperacillin</b> was highly active against carbenicillin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and inhibited many aminoglycoside-resistant organisms. Except for P. aeruginosa, the minimum bactericidal concentration of <b>piperacillin</b> was usually within one tube dilution of the minimum inhibitory concentration. Approximately one-third of the gram-negative bacilli were inhibited synergistically by <b>piperacillin</b> plus amikacin, but no synergy could be demonstrated against enterococci. Piperacillin's in vitro activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to gentamicin's except that it also included B. fragilis, and <b>piperacillin</b> was decidedly superior to presently available penicillins against K. pneumoniae...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of <b>piperacillin</b> in serum, bile, gallbladder wall, abdominal skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue were measured simultaneously {{at various times}} after the intravenous administration of a single 5 -g dose to each of 14 patients undergoing biliary tract surgery. <b>Piperacillin</b> concentrated in the bile with peak levels exceeding 4, 000 micrograms/ml. In a single patient with cystic duct obstruction, trace gallbladder bile <b>piperacillin</b> levels were measured.

40|$|Fifteen (15 - 2 %) of 99 Gram-negative {{bacteria}} {{isolated from}} patients during episodes of fever and neutropenia had minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from < 2 to 32 mg/ 1 {{but were not}} fully sensitive to <b>piperacillin</b> by disc diffusion testing. These 15 isolates were further examined using a chemostat system, in which susceptible isolates were rapidly killed by <b>piperacillin.</b> Only three of the 15 isolates were susceptible to <b>piperacillin</b> when compared to sensitive control strains using the chemostat system. The {{results of this study}} suggest that an increase in the MIC to <b>piperacillin</b> is a less sensitive indicator of resistance to <b>piperacillin</b> amongst Gram-negative isolates than a reduction in the zone of inhibition in disc diffusion testing...|$|E
