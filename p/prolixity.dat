As a scholar he contributed, by his profound philological researches, to {{the reconstruction of}} the language of the Bible, though his work is marred by <b>prolixity</b> and by his refusal to admit shades of meaning in synonyms. As a poet he possessed perfection of style, but lacked feeling and artistic imagination. No one exerted a greater influence than he on the dissemination of modern Hebrew, and no one, on the other hand, did more to retard the development of pure art and of poetic intuition. Because of his energetic commitment to the cause of Jewish emancipation, Wessely may be regarded as a leader of the Maskilim.|$|E

Let them avoid having recourse to civil tribunals when possible. They must not engage in trade forbidden by the canons. Let them not be importunate in speaking of money matters to their flocks. The custom of priests taking money on deposit, for which 'interest is to be paid, is condemned.|$|E
500|$|J. C. Jenkins, Second Parliamentary Counsel at the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, has {{expressed}} some approval at the decision. Firstly, {{he claims that}} it will significantly change the way legislation is drafted. Prior to Pepper, draftsmanship was a [...] "time consuming" [...] and [...] "frustrating rather than enlightening" [...] business. There are risks of [...] "excessive detail, over-elaboration, verbosity, <b>prolixity,</b> iteration, tedious repetition", and so a draftsman avoids directly dealing with every single problem, instead following the rule set out by the Renton Committee to ensure that [...] "sufficient certainty is obtained for a fair-minded and reasonable reader to be in no doubt what is intended, it being assumed {{that no one would}} take entirely perverse points against the draft, or that such points would be brushed aside by the court". The draftsman may be in conflict with a government official who wishes to be overly specific, where this general rule renders their concerns moot; in such situations, the ability to include a passage of a Minister's speech as a way to ensure that the courts will interpret legislation in a specific way may clear up any doubts they feel. As such, Jenkins feels that Pepper may make the jobs of parliamentary draftsmen much easier. Although one academic called Pepper a [...] "long overdue" [...] decision from [...] "which there is no turning back", the overall reaction was a negative one. The decision can be interpreted as promoting legislative supremacy, a key point in a system where parliamentary sovereignty is confirmed.|$|E

2500|$|Dana's {{literary}} style {{came to be}} {{the style}} of The Sun—simple, strong, clear, boiled down. [...] He recorded no theories of journalism other than those of common sense and human interest. He was impatient of <b>prolixity,</b> cant, and the conventional standards of news importance. Three of his lectures on journalism were published in 1895 as the Art of Newspaper Making.|$|E

To Hill he wrote: [...] "The Whole will make Seven; that is, one more to attend these two. Eight crouded into Seven, by a smaller Type. Ashamed as I am of the <b>Prolixity,</b> I thought I owed the Public Eight Vols. in Quantity for the Price of Seven" [...] Richardson later made {{it up to the}} public with [...] "deferred Restorations" [...] of the fourth edition of the novel being printed in larger print with eight volumes and a preface that reads: [...] "It is proper to observe with regard to the present Edition that it has been thought fit to restore many Passages, and several Letters which were omitted in the former merely for shortening-sake." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among the customs, John {{continued}} in Brazil the ancient Portuguese ceremony of the beija-mão, which he esteemed greatly and which fascinated the Brazilians and {{became part of}} their folklore. He received his subjects daily, except for Sundays and holidays. The long lines waiting {{to pay their respects}} and receive favors were a mix of nobles and commoners. According to painter Henry L’Evêque, [...] "the Prince, accompanied by a Secretary of State, a Chamberlain and some household officials, received all the petitions that were presented to him; listened attentively to all the complaints, all the requests of the applicants; consoled one, encouraged others.... The vulgarity of the manners, the familiarity of speech, the insistence of some, the <b>prolixity</b> of others, none of this bored him. He seemed to forget that he was their master, and remember only that he was their father." [...] Oliveira Lim wrote that he [...] "never confused the faces or the pleas, and the applicants marveled at how well he know their lives, their families, even small incidents that had occurred in the past and which they could not believe had risen to the notice of the king." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1951, {{near the}} end of his life, Santayana engaged himself in the weighty task of {{producing}} a one-volume abridgment of The Life of Reason at the urging of his editor at Scribner's, with the assistance of his friend and student, Daniel Cory. As Cory writes in the volume's preface, in addition to excising <b>prolixities</b> and redundancies from the book, [...] "a sustained effort was made to dispel those early mists of idealism from the realistic body of his philosophy, and to make clear to the reader that our idea of a natural world can never be that world itself." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{advantage}} of laying before the reader, {{in the words}} of the actors themselves, the adventures which we must otherwise have narrated in our own, has given great popularity to the publication of epistolary correspondence, as practised by various great authors, and by ourselves in the preceding chapters. Nevertheless, a genuine correspondence of this kind (and Heaven forbid it should be in any respect sophisticated by interpolations of our own!) can seldom be found to contain all in which it is necessary to instruct the reader for his full comprehension of the story. Also it must often happen that various <b>prolixities</b> and redundancies occur in the course of an interchange of letters, which must hang as a dead weight on the progress of the narrative. To avoid this dilemma, some biographers have used the letters of the personages concerned, or liberal extracts from them, to describe particular incidents, or express the sentiments which they entertained; while they connect them occasionally with such portions of narrative, as may serve to carry on the thread of the story.|$|R
2500|$|In 1744–46, Ralph {{wrote one}} of his two most {{important}} works, A history of England during the reigns of King William, Queen Anne, and King George I, with an introductory review of the royal brothers Charles and James. [...] The work ran to two volumes and never got beyond William's reign. [...] However, the work was a direct counter to the histories of John Oldmixon and other whig historians. [...] Okie characterises Ralph's historical point of view as [...] "country party." [...] While that would usually equate to [...] "tory" [...] in the 1740s, Ralph wrote {{from the point of}} view of someone outside London, someone without an interest in affairs of court. [...] His history is superior to Rapin's London-bound history and addressed economic history for the first time in English historiography (Okie 875). [...] Ralph points out the corruption and absurdity of all the courtiers and Parliamentarians who had acted out of self-interest. [...] Also in 1744, Ralph wrote The Use and Abuse of Parliaments in two volumes. [...] These two vast works of history were remarkable feats of <b>prolixity.</b> [...] This work was another somewhat cynical view of the history of Parliament in the 17th century.|$|E
2500|$|The {{necessary}} and proper clause {{has been interpreted}} extremely broadly, thereby giving Congress wide latitude in legislation. The first landmark case involving the clause was McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), which involved {{the establishment of a}} national bank. Alexander Hamilton, in advocating the creation of the bank, argued that there was [...] "a more or less direct" [...] relationship between the bank and [...] "the powers of collecting taxes, borrowing money, regulating trade between the states, and raising and maintaining fleets and navies". Thomas Jefferson countered that Congress's powers [...] "can all be carried into execution without a national bank. A bank therefore is not necessary, and consequently not authorized by this phrase". Chief Justice John Marshall agreed with the former interpretation. Marshall wrote that a Constitution listing all of Congress's powers [...] "would partake of a <b>prolixity</b> of a legal code and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind". Since the Constitution could not possibly enumerate the [...] "minor ingredients" [...] of the powers of Congress, Marshall [...] "deduced" [...] that Congress had the authority to establish a bank from the [...] "great outlines" [...] of the general welfare, commerce and other clauses. Under this doctrine of the {{necessary and}} proper clause, Congress has sweepingly broad powers (known as implied powers) not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution. However, the Congress cannot enact laws solely on the implied powers, any action must be necessary and proper in the execution of the enumerated powers.|$|E
2500|$|The term 'New Formalism' {{was first}} used in the article 'The Yuppie Poet' [...] in the May 1985 issue of the AWP Newsletter, which was an attack on what was {{perceived}} as a movement returning to traditional poetic forms; the article accused the movement's poets not only of political conservatism but also yuppie materialism. New Formalism was a reaction against various perceived deficiencies in the practice of contemporary poets. [...] In his 1987 piece [...] "Notes on the New Formalism," [...] Dana Gioia wrote: [...] "the real issues presented by American poetry in the Eighties will become clearer: the debasement of poetic language; the <b>prolixity</b> of the lyric; the bankruptcy of the confessional mode; the inability to establish a meaningful aesthetic for new poetic narrative and the denial of a musical texture in the contemporary poem. The revival of traditional forms will be seen then as only one response to this troubling situation." [...] For women formalists, the situation was complicated by gender; as [...] Annie Finch wrote in 1994 in the Introduction to [...] "A Formal Feeling Comes: Poems in Form by Contemporary Women", [...] "Readers who have been following the discussion of the [...] "New Formalism" [...] over the last decade may not expect to find such a diversity of writers and themes in a book of formal poems; the poems collected here contradict the popular assumption that formal poetics correspond to reactionary politics and elitist aesthetics... The passion for form unites these many and diverse poets." ...|$|E

60|$|After that ominous interpolation, {{delivered}} with an inhuman iciness that sent a shiver through the court, Mr. Pollexfen {{got to his}} feet.

60|$|The {{fourth class}} of defects is closely {{connected}} with the former; but yet are such as arise likewise from an intensity of feeling disproportionate to such knowledge and value of the objects described, as can be fairly anticipated of men in general, even of the most cultivated classes; and with which therefore few only, and those few particularly circumstanced, can be supposed to sympathize: In this class, I comprise occasional <b>prolixity,</b> repetition, and an eddying, instead of progression, of thought. As instances, see pages 27, 28, and 62 of the Poems, vol. I. and the first eighty lines of the VIth Book of THE EXCURSION.|$|E
