40|$|Abstract—E-commerce {{has become}} a {{thriving}} business model. With easy access to various tools and third-party cashiers, it is straightforward to create and launch e-commerce web applica-tions. However, it remains difficult to create secure ones. While third-party cashiers help bridge the gap of trustiness between merchants and customers, the involvement of cashiers as a new party complicates logic flows of checkout processes. Even a small loophole in a checkout process may lead to financial loss of merchants, thus logic vulnerabilities pose serious threats {{to the security of}} e-commerce applications. Performing manual code reviews is challenging because of the diversity of logic flows and the sophistication of checkout processes. Consequently, it is important to develop automated detection techniques. This paper proposes the first static detection of logic vulner-abilities in e-commerce web applications. The main difficulty of automated detection is the lack of a general and precise notion of correct payment logic. Our key insight is that secure checkout processes share a common invariant: A checkout process is secure when it guarantees the integrity and authenticity of critical payment status (order ID, order total, merchant ID and currency). Our approach combines symbolic execution and taint analysis to detect violations of the invariant by tracking tainted payment status and analyzing critical logic flows among merchants, cashiers and users. We have implemented a symbolic execution framework for PHP. In our evaluation of 22 unique <b>payment</b> <b>modules,</b> our tool detected 12 logic vulnerabilities, 11 of which are new. We have also performed successful proof-of-concept experiments on live websites to confirm our findings. I...|$|R

Opisane so celovite informacijske rešitve (ERP) in predstavljeno je razvojno okolje Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013. Kot glavni cilj magistrskega dela je bila izdelana programska rešitev za plačilni promet v Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013. Rešitev omogoča plačevanje ter izvoz in uvoz plačil, ki jih uporabljajo banke v Sloveniji in Evropi. Na osnovi testiranja izdelanega plačilnega modula je bila potrjena hipoteza, da Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013 s privzetimi moduli ni primeren za izvajanje plačilnega prometa v Sloveniji, in zavrnjena hipoteza, da izdelana rešitev v Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013, narejena za Slovenijo, ni primerna za izvajanje plačilnega prometa v drugih državah Evrope. Predstavljeni so rezultati SWOT-analize plačilnega prometa v starejši različici Microsoft Dynamics NAV 5. 00 in v različici Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013, iz katerih je razvidno, da je plačilni promet v novi različici veliko bolj konkurenčen in cenovno bolj ugoden od prejšnje različice.

40|$|Although tea was {{introduced}} in Kenya in 1903, Africans (natives) were barred from growing the crop until after independence in 1963 when the legislation was repealed. Africans started growing tea under the smallholder tea growing scheme which developed very rapidly. In Kenya, the smallholder tea sector, managed by the Kenya Tea Development Agency Ltd (KTDA), own over 80 % land under tea producing over 60 % made tea (mt) in Kenya. The Kenya tea is grown in prime lands capable of producing over 6000 kg mt per hectare per year under good cropping weather. However, smallholder teas yield on the average less than 2000 kg mt per hectare per year due to use of inappropriate agronomic and cultural practices resulting from low adaptation and adoption of developed and recommended research technologies. For sustainable smallholder tea sector, {{it is necessary that}} tea production technologies developed through extensive research are disseminated and adopted in the tea sector. This can be achieved through an effective and knowledgeable extension service. Smallholders need to plant elite varieties with high yield and quality potentials using correct planting spacing and should prune at the correct pruning height using proper implements. Gappy tea fields need infilling soon after pruning. Fertilizer application is mandatory in tea production and use of NPK fertilizers is recommended in Kenya. KTDA should continue availing the fertilizer on credit and on time. A mechanism is needed to ensure farmers are enrolled for the fertilizer facility and obtained fertilizers are applied on tea, not competing crops. The high smallholder tea quality is partly attributed to fine plucking standard in the sector. The plucking of two leaves and a bud standard should be maintained to sustain the quality. Also effective control of weeds, pests and diseases or management systems are necessary for high and quality tea production. Factory capacity problems should be addressed so that the green leaf production does not exceed processing capacity and vice versa. There is need for good road network and vehicles to ensure that harvested leaves arrive in the factory in good condition even during rainy seasons. Sustainable green tea leaf production requires that farmers are paid adequately and on time to enable them to tend the crop. Regular reviews of green leaf payment and use of correct <b>payment</b> <b>modules</b> ensure sustaining tea production. However, smallholder tea sector is faced with challenges in rising costs of production, especially labour and energy costs. Since tea consumption world wide is not rising as fast as production, the smallholder tea sector needs to intensify tea marketing, market research and product diversification.

40|$|Nowadays, {{electronic}} payment system {{is an essential part}} of modern business. Credit cards or debit cards have been widely used for on-site or remote transactions, greatly reducing the need for inconvenient cash transactions. However, there have been a huge number of incidents of credit card frauds over the Internet due to the security weakness of {{electronic payment}} system. A number of solutions have been proposed in the past to prevent this problem, but most of them were inconvenient and did not satisfy the needs of cardholders and merchants at the same time. In this thesis, we present a new secure card payment system called NNCC (No Number Credit Card) that significantly reduces the possibility of credit card frauds. This scheme is primarily designed for on-line shopping. NNCC is based on the Kerberos cryptographic framework that has been proven to be secure after being used in real world for decades. In this proposed system, instead of card numbers, only the payment tokens are exchanged between the buyers and merchants. The token is generated based on the payment amount, the client information, and merchant information. However it does not contain the credit card number, so the merchant cannot acquire and illegally use the credit card number. A token is cryptographically secure and valid only for the designated merchant, so it is robust against eavesdropping. This thesis describes the underlying cryptographic schemes, the operating principles, and the system design. It explains the concept of Kerberos and the background in Cryptography. Then it discusses the new proposed system and the associated payment processes. We have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype comprised of ecommerce web sites, client <b>modules,</b> <b>payment</b> server, and database.
