5|$|Despite such inaccuracies, {{the tale}} has been {{frequently}} repeated. Individual privileges that did exist {{have fallen into}} disuse—for example the Lord of the Manor of Worksop (which is not a peerage) was extended the <b>privilege</b> <b>and</b> duty of attending the coronation of the British monarch until 1937, but the right was not exercised at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 as the manor was under corporate ownership at the time.|$|E

5|$|In May 1645, Parliament {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} allowing excommunicants {{to appeal the}} church's sentences to Parliament. Another ordinance on 20October contained a list of sins to which the church would be limited in its power to excommunicate. To {{the majority of the}} divines' dismay, an even more Erastian ordinance was proposed in March 1646. The Assembly published a protest, provoking the Commons to charge it with breach of <b>privilege</b> <b>and</b> to submit nine questions to the divines on the matter. Votes were to be included with the answers, an attempt to force the divines associated with the protest petition to reveal themselves.|$|E
5|$|Jesus for President: Politics for Ordinary Radicals is a 2008 book co-written by Evangelical authors Shane Claiborne and Chris Haw, two {{important}} figures in New Monasticism.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to present the <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> immunities enjoyed by the officials and servants of the EU and other persons {{taking part in the}} work of the EU and to compare these <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> immunities and their extent with the regulation of the international law. The thesis is divided into three chapters. The first one offers a survey of the sources of the prvileges and immunities legal regulation and covers the development of the main document [...] Protocol on the <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> immunities of the European Union. The second chapter deals with the personal and factual scope of the <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> immunities and with the waiver of the immunity. The last part of the thesis examines the status of the international officials in terms of the international law and compares the Protocol on the <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> immunities of the EU with the Convention on the <b>Privileges</b> <b>and</b> Immunities of the United Nations, the Agreement Between the United Nations and the United States Regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations and with the General Agreement on <b>Privileges</b> <b>and</b> Immunities of the Council of Europe...|$|R

5|$|Diocletian {{divided the}} Empire again in 293AD, {{appointing}} two Caesars (junior emperors) to rule over further subdivisions of East and West. Each would be subordinate {{to their respective}} Augustus (senior emperor) but would act with supreme authority in his assigned lands. This system would later be called the Tetrarchy. Diocletian's first appointee {{for the office of}} Caesar was Constantius; his second was Galerius, a native of Felix Romuliana. According to Lactantius, Galerius was a brutal, animalistic man. Although he shared the paganism of Rome's aristocracy, he seemed to them an alien figure, a semi-barbarian. On 1 March, Constantius was promoted to the office of Caesar, and dispatched to Gaul to fight the rebels Carausius and Allectus. In spite of meritocratic overtones, the Tetrarchy retained vestiges of hereditary <b>privilege,</b> <b>and</b> Constantine became the prime candidate for future appointment as Caesar as soon as his father took the position. Constantine went to the court of Diocletian, where he lived as his father's heir presumptive.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> immunities {{provided to}} offices of diplomatic missions {{in order to}} facilitate carrying out international relations. The key legal document regulating diplomatic <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> immunities is the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations which commemorated 50 years of its existence this year - since it was signed on 18 April 1961 after the Vienna Conference. The aim of the thesis is to describe the contents of the individual <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> immunities and to consider to which extent the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations represents a suitable legal instrument even for the needs of the today's practice of diplomatic relations. First the thesis deals with general issues related to ensuring diplomatic <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> immunities, theories which justify their necessity and selected provisions of the Vienna Convention. This is followed by an analysis of the individual <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> immunities of a diplomatic mission - the right to display a flag, the inviolability of mission premises, the inviolability of mission archives <b>and</b> documents, tax <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> the freedom of communication...|$|R

40|$|This essay urges for {{the need}} to explore one’s <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> oppressions through Feminist Arabness. Through intersectionality, the author brings forth various {{experiences}} as a woman of color. By exploring <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> oppressions, {{the goal is to}} bring contestations of domination into conversation with neoliberalism, reflexivity and ethical communication. Thus, this study is a call to highlight the need for an integrated approach that combines theory, and Autoethnography in order to reflect a richer intersectional analysis that combines both <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> oppressions as identities. It is also a call towards an intersectional feminist ethic that can in turn identify the connections between one’s <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> disadvantages and how it relates to ethics and reflexivity...|$|R
5|$|The affront at {{the heart}} of Show Boat is still very alive today. It begins with the book and its {{negative}} and one-dimensional images of Black people, and continues on through the colossal and deliberate omission of the Black experience, including the pain of a people traumatized by four centuries of attempted genocide and exploitation. Not to mention the appropriation of Black music for the profit of the very people who oppressed Blacks and Africans. All this continues to offend deeply. The ol' man river of racism continues to run through the history of these productions and is very much part of this (Toronto) production. It is part of the overwhelming need of white Americans and white Canadians to convince themselves of our inferiority – that our demands don't represent a challenge to them, their <b>privilege</b> <b>and</b> their superiority.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the board game Monopoly {{can be traced back}} to the early 20th century. The {{earliest}} known version of Monopoly, known as The Landlord's Game, was designed by an American, Elizabeth Magie, and first patented in 1904 but existed as early as 1902. Magie, a follower of Henry George, originally intended The Landlord's Game to illustrate the economic consequences of Ricardo's Law of Economic rent and the Georgist concepts of economic <b>privilege</b> <b>and</b> land value taxation. A series of board games were developed from 1906 through the 1930s that involved the buying and selling of land and the development of that land. By 1933, a board game had been created much like the version of Monopoly sold by Parker Brothers and its related companies through the rest of the 20th century, and into the 21st. Several people, mostly in the Midwestern United States and near the East Coast, contributed to the game's design and evolution.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{continued}} use of the name {{has come from the}} team's owners and a majority of fans, which include some Native Americans. Supporters say that the name honors the achievements and virtues of Native Americans, and that it is not intended in a negative manner. Some, such as team president Bruce Allen, also point to the use of Redskins by three high school teams, two on reservations, that have a majority of Native American students. Supporters have asserted that a majority of Native Americans are not offended by the name based upon a national poll by Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004. In a commentary published soon after that poll, 15 Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of white <b>privilege</b> <b>and</b> colonialism. Specific criticism of the methodology includes the use of self-reporting to identify Native Americans, which violated the basic principles supporting the validity of public opinion polling. In May 2016, the Washington Post published a poll that duplicated the central question posed in 2004, yielding an identical result.|$|E

2500|$|Rehnquist {{distinguished}} the <b>Privileges</b> <b>and</b> Immunities {{from the}} Dormant Commerce Clause by explaining {{that while the}} Dormant Commerce Clause is a judicially created doctrine to prevent economic protectionism, the Privileges & Immunities Clause is an actual Constitutional text to protect people’s rights. Thus, since the clauses have two distinct purposes, the “market participant” exception {{did not apply to}} the <b>Privileges</b> <b>and</b> Immunities analysis. [...] Camden could pressure public works contractors to hire city residents without running afoul of the Dormant Commerce Clause, but this did not allow the city to escape scrutiny under the <b>Privileges</b> <b>and</b> Immunities Clause. [...] However, Rehnquist went on to explain that the <b>Privileges</b> <b>and</b> Immunities Clause did not bar all potentially discriminatory acts by a state or political subdivision.|$|R

5|$|The Book of the Dead {{developed}} from {{a tradition of}} funerary manuscripts {{dating back to the}} Egyptian Old Kingdom. The first funerary texts were the Pyramid Texts, first used in the Pyramid of King Unas of the 5th dynasty, around 2400 BCE. These texts were written {{on the walls of the}} burial chambers within pyramids, and were exclusively for the use of the Pharaoh (and, from the 6th dynasty, the Queen). The Pyramid Texts were written in an unusual hieroglyphic style; many of the hieroglyphs representing humans or animals were left incomplete or drawn mutilated, most likely to prevent them causing any harm to the dead pharaoh. The purpose of the Pyramid Texts was to help the dead King take his place amongst the gods, in particular to reunite him with his divine father Ra; at this period the afterlife was seen as being in the sky, rather than the underworld described in the Book of the Dead. Towards the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramid Texts ceased to be an exclusively royal <b>privilege,</b> <b>and</b> were adopted by regional governors and other high-ranking officials.|$|E
5|$|The {{privilege}} of peerage extends to all temporal peers and peeresses {{regardless of their}} position {{in relation to the}} House of Lords. The right to sit in the House is separate from the <b>privilege,</b> <b>and</b> is held by only some peers (see History of reform of the House of Lords). Scottish peers from the Acts of Union 1707 and Irish peers from the Act of Union 1800, therefore, have the {{privilege of}} peerage. From 1800, Irish peers have had the right to stand for election to the United Kingdom House of Commons but they lose the privilege of peerage for the duration of their service in the lower House. Since 1999, hereditary peers of England, Scotland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom who are not members of the House of Lords may stand for election to the House of Commons. Their privilege of peerage is not explicitly lost by service in the lower House. Any peer issuing a disclaimer under the provisions of the Peerage Act 1963 loses all privileges of peerage. The privilege of peerage also extends to wives and widows of peers. A peeress by marriage loses the privilege upon marrying a commoner, but a peeress suo jure does not. Individuals who hold courtesy titles, however, do not have such privileges by virtue of those titles. Lords Spiritual (the 26 Archbishops and Bishops who sit in the House of Lords) do not have the privilege of peerage as, at least since 1621, they have been Lords of Parliament, and not peers.|$|E
