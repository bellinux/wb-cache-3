FPI presented a mock-up of the advanced PAK FA fighter, made of composite materials which is designed {{in such a way}} that if it is deformed, the external impact is displayed on a screen. It will allow experts to assess the damage and decrease aircraft’s maintenance cost by eliminating the need for expensive scheduled examinations.|$|E
25|$|Important {{developments}} in patent law {{emerged during the}} 18th century through a slow process of judicial interpretation of the law. During the reign of Queen Anne, patent applications were required to supply a complete specification of the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> of the invention for public access. Legal battles around the 1796 patent taken out by James Watt for his steam engine, established the principles that patents could be issued for improvements of an already existing machine and that ideas or principles without specific practical application could also legally be patented. Influenced by the philosophy of John Locke, the granting of patents began {{to be viewed as}} a form of intellectual property right, rather than simply the obtaining of economic privilege.|$|E

25|$|Modern optics {{encompasses}} {{the areas of}} optical science and engineering that became popular in the 20th century. These areas of optical science typically relate to the electromagnetic or quantum properties of light but do include other topics. A major subfield of modern optics, quantum optics, deals with specifically quantum mechanical properties of light. Quantum optics is not just theoretical; some modern devices, such as lasers, have <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> that depend on quantum mechanics. Light detectors, such as photomultipliers and channeltrons, respond to individual photons. Electronic image sensors, such as CCDs, exhibit shot noise corresponding to the statistics of individual photon events. Light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic cells, too, cannot be understood without quantum mechanics. In the study of these devices, quantum optics often overlaps with quantum electronics.|$|E
