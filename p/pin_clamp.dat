The remaining parts of the external fixator are then wrapped using sterile surgical towels to exclude it from the sterile operative field (Fig.  1 d).|$|E
30|$|Factors which {{determine}} the stiffness of a fixator construct depend on its two main constituents: the device material and configuration {{on one hand}} and the pins on the other. Fixator rigidity is directly proportion to pin stiffness that is increased by: firstly improving material properties; secondly by increasing pin diameter—but not to exceed one-third of the bone diameter—and thirdly a decreased pin offset (the free bending length of pins which is the distance between the bone surface and the external <b>pin</b> <b>clamp).</b> Other pin factors that add to fixator rigidity are increased pin spread (length of the fractured bone involved in fixation), increased pin numbers and levels and lastly, increased pin divergent angle in the axial plane [7, 11, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Considering the aforementioned factors, the design of the external fixator used in this study can be considered as a modification of the Catagni and Cattaneo module in 1986 [11, 12] but where the distal rings are replaced by femoral arches.|$|E
30|$|The {{principles}} of biomechanical stability of external fixation {{would indicate that}} pin diameter, number and spread combined with <b>pin</b> <b>clamp</b> and clamp–bar interfaces {{need to be addressed}} individually and together in order to achieve a maximally performing construct in the clinical setting. In the standard cantilever-loaded mode, the monolateral fixator is at risk of pin loosening and breakage. During failure the distractive force is lost and the desired biological effect reduced. Modifications of this frame have been developed to counter this problem by which fixation is supplemented by additional lateral pins or by extending the fixation to the iliac crest [14]. In this study {{we have been able to}} show that it is possible to introduce three 6 -mm pins into the peri-acetabular region with an angular separation of 55 °. Studies by Johnson and Fischer [20] showed that as angular separation increases from 0 ° to 90 °, the bending stiffness also increases. The increased insertion angle of the post capital pin reduces the risk of sciatic nerve damage and improves the stability of fixation by increasing the angular separation between pins.|$|E

30|$|Bilateral CT scan is the {{available}} method {{to confirm the}} incongruence of the lateral malleolus in the incisura fibularis tibiae [9, 13]. The radius of the distal fibula increases distally of the incisura fibularis tibiae, leading to lateralization of the external malleolus and widening of the ankle mortise [9]. Fibular malrotation is difficult to visualize on plain radiographs. If rotational malalignment is suspected, a CT scan with three-dimensional reconstruction should be considered [2, 8, 20, 23, 27, 28]. MRI examination is not necessary, but it can detect interposition of soft tissue, which may also be detected perioperatively. MRI has {{the added benefit of}} articular cartilage assessment [8, 9, 28]. Secondary reconstruction is indicated in the presence of reasonable ankle function and even in the presence of arthritic changes [7, 9]. The optimal time to perform reconstruction has not been defined clearly. Arthritic changes may be severe already after several months or may be minimal even after 2 or 3  years [12, 17, 26]. The period between the initial trauma and correction is not affecting clinical outcome, but correcting the malunion soon after the diagnosis and before osteoarthritis has developed is recommended. (Table  5) [20, 26, 28] The goal of any reconstructive intervention for malunion is to restore the anatomical alignment, joint congruency and joint stability of the ankle. Reconstruction may reduce the progression of degenerative changes and can decrease the symptoms of arthritis by decreasing instability and load on the arthritic locations of the joint [8, 12, 17, 28]. In most cases, reconstructive surgery consists of lengthening and derotation of the distal fibula. Three types of osteotomies have been described. Oblique or Z-osteotomies of the fibula are advised for correction of shortening and external rotation less than 10 °. An oblique osteotomy through the old fracture is only indicated for a Weber B fracture and allows better correction but is difficult to perform. Transverse osteotomy is indicated for malunion after Weber C fracture and is always performed above the syndesmosis [8]. If external rotation is exceeding 10 °, a transverse osteotomy allows an easier derotation and another benefit of the transverse osteotomy is the significant amount of lengthening that can be achieved [12, 17, 28]. A laminar spreader, a <b>pin</b> <b>clamp</b> and an AO compression device can be used as distractors for fibular lengthening [7, 9, 12, 17, 28, 31]. The secret of a successful reconstruction is the anatomic positioning of the external malleolus in the incisura fibularis tibiae. Debridement of the syndesmotic scar tissue is absolutely necessary to be able to lengthen the fibula, otherwise the fibula cannot be pushed downwards to the tibiofibular joint. After debridement, if there are still remaining fibres of the syndesmosis, the ankle may be stable, otherwise a syndesmotic position screw has to be placed, e.g., through the plate used to fix the osteotomy. If syndesmotic injury is suspected on direct visualization during surgery or by C-arm stress views, syndesmotic fixation by noncannulated fully threaded cortical screws through four cortices is recommended [8, 9, 20]. Bone grafts are advised to fill an osteotomy gap of more than 3  mm [20]. Choices of bone grafts vary between structural allografts or iliac crest structural autografts or cancellous bone autografts [32]. Cancellous graft out of the supramalleolar area is most often sufficient.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{advances}} in plastic surgery have significantly improved {{the outcome of}} severe open tibial fractures. An improved understanding of cutaneous blood supply combined with {{advances in}} microsurgical techniques has led to reliable coverage of large soft tissue defects by either local or free tissue transfer, and {{a significant reduction in}} the incidence of deep infection. The method of skeletal stabilization of open tibial fractures remains controversial. Although intramedullary nailing (IMN) is increasingly used for the stabilization of both closed and open tibial diaphyseal fractures, we advise caution in the use of IMN in severe open fractures because of the high risk of deep sepsis. We believe that external fixation continues to have {{a key role in the}} stabilization of the more severe open tibial fractures, particularly heavily contaminated injuries, fractures associated with significant bone loss, and cases associated with a high risk of infection. However, the use of external fixation in open fractures demands a close cooperation between orthopaedic and plastic surgeons to maximize wound access without compromising skeletal stability. We advocate unilateral external fixation with individual <b>pin</b> <b>clamps</b> and multiple longitudinal bars for stable open fractures with minimal bone loss. Improved materials, modern surgical techniques, and close postfixation monitoring of fracture healing have reduced the incidence of problems such as pin-site infection and loosening, delayed union, and malunion. The advent of the Ilizarov method and small wire circular external fixation has rationalized the management of the open tibial fracture associated with significant bone loss and reduced the need for autogenous bone grafting. We prefer local or free tissue transfer by plastic surgeons rather than the transport of poor quality soft-tissues that accompanies the Ilizarov method. The ability to reliably reconstruct large soft-tissue and bone defects allows an aggressive debridement, similar to a radical tumor resection, which is essential to prevent deep infection...|$|R

Their two-dimensional structural action results in lighter structures and therefore offers numerous economic advantages. Recently interest in rectangular plates increased due to rapid growth in electronic technology where electronic circuit boards {{in the form of}} thin rectangular plates are employed. It is well known that while a clamped boundary condition along the edge of thin rectangular plates is easy to formulate mathematically, it is difficult to achieve, even under laboratory conditions. This {{is due in part to}} the fact that some rotational elasticity is likely to be found in such supports, whether it is introduced intentionally or inadvertently. In this study, the effects of such elasticity on the free vibration and buckling of plates subjected to uniform in-plane loading are examined. Loading is applied in a direction perpendicular to a pair of opposite edges where lateral displacement is forbidden and edge rotation is opposed by a moment proportional to the degree of edge rotation. The edges running parallel to the in-plane loading are free. Highly accurate solutions are obtained by the method of superposition. Two plates are analysed; one with rotational elastic support at one edge, the other edge being simply supported and, a second plate with rotational elastic support at the pair of opposite edges. Free vibration eigenvalues and buckling loads are computed for various plate geometries, dimensionless rotational stiffnesses with various in-plane loads.

In addition, the chemical composition and topography of the surface layer, wetting ability, corrosion resistance and influence of the heat treatment on structure of the alloy were also investigated. The results showed that the highest hardness was observed for alkali-treated samples, and this could be correlated with the structure of the sample that contained martensite and a higher phase transformation temperature. This treatment caused a very large increase of nickel in the top layer and decreased resistance in pitting corrosion. These results disqualified the treatment to be considered as useful for medical applications.

We first consider the form of an elastic sheet that is partially adhered to a rigid substrate, accounting for deflections with large slope: the Sticky Elastica. Starting from the classical Euler Elastica we provide numerical results for the profiles of such blisters and present asymptotic expressions that go beyond the previously known, linear, approximations. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by desktop experiments and suggest a new method for the measurement of material properties for systems undergoing large deformations. With the aim to gain better understanding of the initial appearance of blisters we next investigate the deformation of a thin elastic sheet floating on a liquid surface. We show that, after the appearance of initial wrinkles, the sheet delaminates from the liquid over a finite region at a critical compression, forming a delamination blister. We determine the initial blister size and the evolution of blister size with continuing compression before verifying our theoretical results with experiments at a macroscopic scale. We next study theoretically the deposition of thin sheets onto a grooved substrate, in the context of graphene adhesion. We develop a model to understand the equilibrium of the sheet allowing for partial conformation of sheet to substrate. This model gives phys- ical insight into recent observations of ‘snap-through’ from flat to conforming states and emphasises the crucial role of substrate shape in determining the nature of this transition. We finally present a theoretical investigation of stiction in nanoscale electromechanical contact switches. Our model captures the elastic bending of the switch in response to both electrostatic and van der Waals forces and accounts for geometrically nonlinear deflections. We solve the resulting equations numerically to study how a cantilever beam adheres to a fixed bottom electrode: transitions between free, <b>pinned</b> and <b>clamped</b> states are shown to be discontinuous and to exhibit significant hysteresis. The implications for nanoscale switch design are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The First Part of {{this thesis}} is {{concerned}} with the theoretical formulation, critical examination and practical applications of the Finite Element approximation in the vibration problems of elastic beams idealising the actual turbine blades. The method is presented in a generality encompassing a large body of useful linear vibration theories of beams. The basic and refined element models are introduced, and the convergence properties of each model studied. A rigorous proof of the convergence of the Finite Element solutions to the exact values is included in the case of torsional vibrations. The use of refined models is advantageous, especially in cases where the modal curves are of some complexity, e. g., vibrations at higher modes and beams with certain boundary conditions. The general non-dimensional forms of element dynamic-stiffness matrices for linearly pre-twisted beams are given. numerical results obtained with polynomial approximation in bending-bending and bending-bending-torsion vibrations of beams, where the effects of shear and rotatory inertia may not be negligible and linear taper may be present, show good convergence characteristics. Satisfactory results are obtained with the use of only a few, number of elements. The application of the method to vibrations of beams carrying concentrated masses and supported on elastic springs is briefly demonstrated. Representative results show good agreement with the exact values. The Finite Element Method provides strong and stable convergence characteristics. It is simple to apply and ideally suited to digital computers. On the other hand, the versatility of the method, in the treatment of boundary conditions, alone is a considerable advantage over the other more conventional numerical methods. In the Second Part of the thesis the Finite Element Method is applied to investigate the vibrational characteristics of uniform and tapered slender beams with, or without, pre-twist, and having various boundary conditions. The first four frequency ratios and modal shapes are presented for the following ranges of problem parameters; Pre-twist = 0 to 90 degrees, ratio of flexural rigidities = 1 to 256, deptli and width taper parameters = - 0. 5 to 0. 5. The boundary conditions considered are those obtainable from combinations of free, <b>pinned</b> and <b>clamped</b> conditions at the ends of a beam. Theoretical results agree closely with experimental results presented in the thesis...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new model}} for analyzing a nonlinear soil-pile interaction subject to horizontal shaking of a vertical circular pile embedded in a soil layer of finite thickness. The pile rests on bedrock with either a <b>pinned</b> or a <b>clamped</b> support. The soil mass is assumed composing of a "semi-nonlinear" inner soil zone around the pile and a linear viscoelastic soil zone outside the inner zone. When the inner soil behaves linearly, the present solutions are identical to those obtained by Nogami and Novak in 1977. Numerical results show that soil resistance of less slender piles developed against the vibration is larger than that of more slender piles. Soil resistance depends more strongly {{on the size of}} the nonlinear inner zone when the pile is vibrating at a frequency higher than the natural frequency of the soil. Soil nonlinearity, in general, results in a smaller damping and stiffness of the soil-pile system, except at high frequency. At higher vibration frequency, the situation can be very complicated. The exact value of the dynamic stiffness of the soil-pile system depends on elastic shear wave speed, soil nonlinearity, vibration frequency, slenderness ratio of the pile, magnitude of vibration, and tip conditions of the pile. Generally speaking, the dynamic stiffness is smaller than the static stiffness. The normalized dynamic stiffness for pile with a pinned tip is, in general, larger than that with a clamped tip, while the reverse is true for the damping.

40|$|Power modules {{typically}} {{comprise of}} several power devices {{connected in parallel}} {{for the purpose of}} delivering high current capability. This is especially the case in SiC where small active area and low current MOSFETs are the only option due to defect density control and yield issues in the epitaxial growth of SiC wafers. Electrothermal variations between parallel connected devices can emerge from manufacturing variability, non-uniform degradation rates, variation in gate driving just to mention a few. The impact of electrothermal variation between parallel-connected devices as a function of device technology is thus important to consider especially since failure of the power module requires only failure in a single device. Furthermore, the impact of these electrothermal variations in parallel-connected devices on the total electrothermal ruggedness of the power module under anomalous switching conditions like unclamped inductive switching is important to consider for the different device technologies. In this thesis, the impact of initial junction temperature variation, switching rates and thermal boundary conditions between parallel-connected diodes have been evaluated for SiC Schottky and silicon <b>PiN</b> diodes under <b>clamped</b> and unclamped inductive switching. Finite element simulations have been used to support the experimental measurements. Similar studies have been performed in CoolMOS super-junction MOSFETs, silicon IGBTs and SiC power MOSFETs. New insights regarding the failure of parallel connected devices under unclamped inductive switching have been revealed from the models and measurements. Overall, the thesis makes a major contribution in the understanding of the electrothermal performance of parallel connected devices for different transistor and diode technologies. ...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a renewed}} {{interest}} in the wind estimate over and around forest areas dueto the increasing demand of wind-energy resources. Many researches have been donewith simplied forest models. However, the introduction of a simple two-dimensionalclearing adds further parameters, such as the width of the clearing, which furthercomplicates the analysis. The main purpose of the present experimental and nu-merical efforts is, therefore, to characterize the ow over the forest clearing and tosuggest the suitable location for the wind-power generation over the forest clearing. The experiments were performed in the Minimum Turbulence Level (MTL) windtunnel at KTH in Stockholm, and PIV data evaluation and analysis were carried out. The canopy model consists of several wooden at plates, and to each of the plateswooden cylindrical <b>pins</b> were <b>clamped</b> in a staggered layout to mimic a homogeneoushigh-density forest. The total length of the forest model is 40 hc, where hc indicatesthe canopy height. Two cases were experimentally investigated, one with a fullforest conguration and the other with the presence of a clearing that starts fromx=hc = 20 and ends at x=hc = 30, where x is a streamwise coordinate that startsat the forest windward edge. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was performed, andplanar velocity snapshots were taken at the downwind edge of the clearing. Large Eddy Simulations (LES) were also conducted to complement the experi-mental information. The present LES code was developed by modifying the DirectNumerical Simulation (DNS) code of the turbulent boundary layer ow by Kametani& Fukagata (2011), by adding the subgrid scale model part and the empirical canopymodel part into the DNS code. Both the experimental and the numerical results indicate that the clearing is as-sociated to a streamwise velocity defect in the mean prole mainly due to the strongturbulent diffusion into the clearing region. The turbulence is redistributed amongstthe various velocity components so that the streamwise velocity variance is reduced,while the vertical velocity variance is enhanced. The streamwise velocity varianceis in fact damped due to the absence of the canopy drag from x=hc = 20, whileenhanced vertical-velocity uctuations can be observed {{at the end of the}} clearing. However, the effects are immediately weakened both by a ow re-acceleration andby a new surface layer development right after passing the downwind clearing edge. The clearing effect seems to be dominant in the roughness sublayer at least for theneutral atmospheric conditions. The clearing perturbation seems to be associatedto turbulent mixing at its initial stage near y hc, followed by a rapid distorsionnear the clearing trailing edge. This phenomenon is highlighted by the low valueof the vertical correlation length scale that, after the clearing trailing edge, risesagain towards to homogenous forest condition. The LES results further show thata suitable area for the wind-turbine operation is close to the upwind clearing edgewhere the energy contents is the highest, while the turbulent intensity is lowestbetween the clearing. They also indicate that wind-speed enhancement can be ex-pected downstream of the short forest edge, implying that the ow can be optimizedfor wind-power generation just by changing the forest conguration...|$|R
