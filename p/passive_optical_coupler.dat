40|$|This paper proposes and evaluates {{two related}} fast packet {{switching}} architectures based on time-division multiplexed integrated photonic fabrics. The architectures are targeted towards low-latency inter-node switching and intra-node routing in high-speed networks. The inter-node switch achieves output packet queueing via asynchronous time-division multiplexing a strictly-nonblocking photonic fabric. Buffer behavior is analyzed at both input and output stages {{to determine the effect}} of varying the switching bandwidth on the performance metrics (delay, throughput and packet loss probability). The dependency of a finite output buffer latency and overflow probability on the normalized switching bandwidth, in a switch with output queueing, is first analyzed in this paper. The intra-node trunk traffic router consists of a <b>passive</b> <b>optical</b> <b>coupler</b> followed by an active routing stage.

40|$|Several optical {{interconnect}} architectures inside data centers (DCs) {{have been proposed}} to efficiently handle the rapidly growing traffic demand. However, not many works have tackled the interconnects at top-of-rack (ToR), which have a large impact {{on the performance of}} the data center networks (DCNs) and can introduce serious scalability limitations due to their high cost and power consumption. In this paper, we propose a passive optical ToR interconnect architecture (POTORI) to replace the conventional electronic packet switch (EPS) in the access tier of DCNs. In the data plane, POTORI relies on a <b>passive</b> <b>optical</b> <b>coupler</b> to interconnect the servers within the rack and interfaces toward the aggregation/core tiers. The POTORI control plane is based on a centralized rack controller responsible for managing the communications among the servers in the rack. We propose a cycle-based medium access control (MAC) protocol to efficiently manage the exchange of control messages and the data transmission inside the rack. We also introduce and evaluate a dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithm for POTORI, namely largest first (LF). Extensive simulation results show that, with the use of fast tunable optical transceivers, POTORI and the proposed LF strategy are able to achieve an average packet delay below 10 μs under realistic DC traffic scenarios, outperforming conventional EPSs. On the other hand, with slower tunable optical transceivers, a careful configuration of the network parameters (e. g., maximum cycle time of the MAC protocol) is necessary to obtain a good network performance in terms of the average packet delay.

40|$|Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) {{has been}} shown to be one of the most {{promising}} ways to exploit the enormous bandwidth of a single mode optical fiber. Networks employing WDM are commonly based on <b>optical</b> <b>passive</b> star <b>couplers.</b> The major cost and limitations of such networks lie in the interface (both transmitters and receivers) providing optical-electronic conversion between stations and communication media.

When fixed wavelength devices are used, to reduce the number of transmitters and receivers in each station several stations may transmit and receive on the same wavelength.

40|$|AbstractThe {{hypercube}} is {{a widely}} used interconnection topology as it presents a lot of attractive properties. Recently, the hypercube has been proposed as a virtual topology for TWDM multihop lightwave networks based on <b>optical</b> <b>passive</b> star <b>couplers.</b> However, in most of previous works, each station in the network has only one fixed or tunable transmitter and one fixed or tunable receiver. The tunable transmitters and receivers suffer from high cost, long tuning delay and small tunable range. While the fixed transceiver configuration has low cost, its performance such as transmission concurrence is greatly limited. In this paper, we propose the transceiver configuration that each station uses multiple fixed transmitters and multiple fixed receivers. This configuration can greatly improve the performance while being able to emulate the tunability of the tunable transceivers without suffering tuning delay. We will present a wavelength assignment scheme for the transceivers.

40|$|The {{single mode}} optical fiber {{possesses}} an enormous bandwidth {{of more than}} 30 THz in the low-loss optical region of 1. 3 μm and 1. 5 μm. Through Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), the optical fiber bandwidth {{can be divided into}} a set of high-speed channels, where each channnel is assigned its own unique wavelength. An M x M <b>passive</b> <b>optical</b> star <b>coupler</b> is a simple broadcast medium, in which light energy incident at any input is uniformly coupled (or distributed) to all the outputs. Thus, a passive star along with the WDM channels can be used to configure a Local Area Network (LAN). In this LAN, users require tunable devices to access a complete or a partial set of the WDM channels. Due to these multiple channels, many concurrent packet transmissions corresponding to different user pairs are possible and thus the total system throughput can be much higher than the data rates of each individual channel. To fairly arbitrate the data channels among the users, media access protocols are needed. Depending upon the number of data channels and the number of users, two possible situations arise. In the first case, the number of users is much larger than the number of data channels and in the second, the number of users equals to the the number of channels. In both cases, data channel contention may arise if multiple users access the same given channel and must be resolved. This thesis proposes media access protocols for <b>passive</b> <b>optical</b> star networks. All the proposed protocols are slotted in nature, i. e., the time axis on each channel is divided into slots. The well known Slotted-ALOHA and Reservation ALOHA protocols are extended to the multi channel network environment. The thesis also proposes switching protocols (equal number of channels and users), contention-based reservation protocols for this network architecture. To interconnect these star networks, a multi-control channel protocol is also proposed along with two interconnecting techniques. Since there are multiple data channels, the data packets on different channels may be destined to the same user. However, if the user is equipped with only one receiver, the user can receive only one packet and ignores others. This is called a 'receiver collision' and the thesis also studies the effect of these receiver collisions on the data channels. Two network architectures, one for a packet circulating ring network and the other for a circuit switched application are described. Finally, the thesis studies some implementation considerations for these protocols...|$|R

The apparatus was invented for original use in measuring the mass flow of a two-phase cryogenic fluid (e. g., liquid hydrogen containing bubbles of hydrogen gas), but underlying principles of operation can readily be adapted to non-cryogenic two-phase fluids. The system (see figure) includes a laser module, which contains two or more laser diodes, each operating at a different wavelength.
