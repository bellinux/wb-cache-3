50|$|A stew is a {{combination}} of solid food ingredients that have been cooked in liquid and served in the resultant gravy. Ingredients in a stew can include any combination of vegetables (such as carrots, potatoes, onions, beans, peppers and tomatoes) or meat, especially tougher meats suitable for slow-cooking, such as beef. <b>Poultry,</b> <b>sausages,</b> and seafood are also used. While water can be used as the stew-cooking liquid, wine, stock, and beer are also common. Seasoning and flavourings may also be added. Stews are typically cooked at a relatively low temperature (simmered, not boiled), allowing flavors to mingle.|$|E
40|$|Lipid {{oxidation}} is a {{major cause}} of meat quality deterio-ration. Lipid oxidation is an important determinant of shelf life of meat and meat products. Antioxidants are natural or synthetic substances used to prevent lipid oxidation. Meat protection, primarily against lipid components, is possible by addition of antioxidants to feed mixes. This is the way to ensure oxidative stability of meat fats during the post-slaughter processing of carcasses and storage of meat. The aim of our project was to investigate the protective effect of natural antioxidants rosemary (500 mg. kg- 1) and vitamin E (40 mg/bird/day) added to feed mixes and fed to broiler chickens from day 21 to day 42 of life.

40|$|ABSTRACT Semi-dry, {{fermented}} sausages were made, incorporating mechanically deboned {{turkey meat}} (MDTM) and hand deboned turkey meat in ratios of 0 : 100, 20 : 80, 35 : 65, and 50 : 50, and polyphosphate salt levels of 0 % and 0. 5 %. These sausages were evaluated for objective and subjective characteristics: proximate composition and pH (raw and cooked), total acidity, yields, shear and tear strengths, and sensory acceptability. Addition of phosphates {{had no effect}} on the proximate composition or yields of sausages. This was contrary to literature reports, but was probably due to the long processing time of the sausages. Phosphate salts raised the pH of sausages, as expected. The shear and tear values of the sausages were significantly increased by addition of phosphates and significantly decreased by increasing levels of MDTM. No significant interactions were found. Sensory evaluations tended to indicate that, when thinly sliced, sausages were considered primarily for flavor rather than for texture or appearance. The sausages made in this study were all considered acceptable, to a degree dependent on the individual's preference for the spicy flavor. Alkaline phosphate salts have potential use in stabilizing MDTM for use in semi-dry, fermented <b>poultry</b> <b>sausages...</b>|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to increase the portfolio of organic meat products for the consumer, by supplying new products preserved by organic grown herbs and berries. The consumers will benefit from a growing range of new, attractive, organic meat products, the Danish producers of organic meat products will benefit form a growing market and the producers of organic herbs and berries will experience an increasing demand for organic grown herbs and berries. The project has been consumer driven, as the project initially investigated the attitude of the organic consumer to this new way to produce organic meat-products. Also {{at the end of the}} project, the consumer acceptance of the resulting two new meat products (dices of ham, with garlic & sage covered in a basil pesto and <b>poultry</b> <b>sausages</b> with rose hip, sea buck thorn and ramsons) was investigated, as the test panel were presented for the products (taste, visual appearance) and their willingness to buy the product were tested. The project has demonstrated that the consumers are ready for such new meat products and ready to pay a reasonable extra price, provided they have a positive experience when buying the product. The project has investigated 5 relevant plants, which is found acceptable for the consumers to use in meat products. Further, they have the potential for a commercial, organic production in Denmark. In combination with the increasing demand for organic product in DK, an excellent perspective for development of more organic meat products added herbs and berries should exist. This will, in longer terms, increase the demand for organic grown herbs and berries in Denmark...|$|E
40|$|Summary. New {{trends of}} meat {{industry}} development, on {{the example of}} sausages are shown. The detailed description of indicators of quality of meat raw materials, auxiliary materials and their influence on the processes of tissue and microbial fermentation {{in the process of}} ripening raw sausages. Measures for improving the quality control of meat raw materials, auxiliary materials, as well as the processing conditions in all stages of production of smoked products are suggested. The modern technology of production of raw sausages with starter cultures and complex products, allowing better standardization process is considered. Questions of chemistry of color formation, the formation of taste and flavor, textures and the suppression of undesired microflora in foods in general, and in particular the raw sausage are thoroughly covered. Ideas about factors affecting the formation of color in sausages are given. It is pointed out that the susceptibility to oxidation of nitrosilmioglobin {{is directly related to the}} fat oxidation in the whole redox potential. Trends in the market of raw sausages are shown. Requirements used in the meat industry to starting cultures are shown. Recommendations on the rational use of starter cultures, and other functional additives in technology of uncooked fermented products, which are used to improve the quality and ensure a high level of product safety are given.

The word Sauerkraut in Alsatian has the form sûrkrût, same as in other southwestern German dialects, and means [...] "sour cabbage" [...] as its Standard German equivalent. This word was included into the French language as choucroute. To make it, the cabbage is finely shredded, layered with salt and juniper and left to ferment in wooden barrels. Sauerkraut can be served with <b>poultry,</b> pork, <b>sausage</b> or even fish. Traditionally it is served with pork, Strasbourg sausage or frankfurters, bacon, smoked pork or smoked Morteau or Montbéliard sausages or a selection of pork products.

40|$|A {{semi-automatic}} system under development by Aerojet Medical and Biological Systems for the direct fluorescent antibody {{detection of salmonellae}} was evaluated with various food, feed, and environmental samples. All samples were simultaneously examined by Automated Bioassay System (ABS), manual direct fluorescent antibody procedures and cultural procedures. The ABS gave satisfactory results with the processed samples. It detected all of the culturally positive powdered egg and candy samples with no false negative results and gave only 6. 6 and 5. 3 % false positive rates, respectively. With meatmeal samples the ABS failed to detect one culturally positive specimen that was also positive by manual fluorescent antibody and gave one (1. 1 %) false-positive result. A high rate of false-negative results was obtained by ABS on unprocessed samples of creek water, <b>poultry,</b> and <b>sausage.</b> Adding another enrichment step to the protocol reduced the false-negative rate considerably but severely increased the false-positive rate. The instruments worked reasonably well, but {{research is needed to}} improve enrichment procedures for samples to be processed by the system...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The {{aim of the}} {{dissertation}} was {{to conduct}} a survey on eating habits and consumption of selected nutrients in adolescents, depending on the sex {{and the type of}} the school attended. Another objective was to check the influence of mass media and an educational program on the formation of eating habits. Based on all the findings, an education plan focused on eating habits was created for the needs of nurses to educate adolescents. Methodology: For the purposes of dissertation research, a combination of quantitative and qualitative research was used. The quantitative part of the research was realized using a combination of two questionnaire tools ? a self?constructed questionnaire measuring adolescents´ eating habits, and the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ). A total of 1130 15 ? 18 year-old students of four?year grammar schools, secondary medical schools, and students of the specialization chef?waiter at vocational schools from the South Bohemian Region were involved in the study. The qualitative research was based on a comparative analysis. A total of 59 probands from the three types of schools above mentioned were selected. Results: The results of our research show that there are no statistically significant differences in compliance with nutrition recommendations regarding gender, but significant differences were found in connection with the type of school attended, where the nutritional recommendations are mostly followed by students of grammar schools, then by students of secondary medical schools and in the smallest degree by students of secondary vocational schools ? the chef ?waiter specialization. Significant differences between sexes were found in consumption of selected food components, when girls compared to boys eat more fresh vegetables and fruits. On the contrary, boys eat more beef, pork and <b>poultry</b> meat, <b>sausages,</b> potatoes, eggs and fried foods compared to girls. There were also significant differences between students of particular types of schools. There was no statistically significant relationship between mass media influences on eating and adolescents' nutritional recommendations. Based on the TFEQ results, it can be concluded that there is a statistically significant difference in the conscious reduction of food intake by gender where girls cut down on food intake more than boys. The results of the qualitative part of the research show that an appropriately chosen educational program has an influence on the formation of eating habits in adolescents. Scientific benefits of the dissertation: The benefit of this research is, above all, the fact that {{as one of the few}} studies that have been done, this one brings comprehensive information about nutrition of adolescents aged 15 ? 18 WHO study at grammar schools, secondary medical schools, or study the specialization chef-waiter at vocational schools. The results of our research are in many respects consistent with those obtained by other researchers and refer to the fact that adolescent eating habits cannot be described as ideal. In view of our findings, it would be useful to carry out other research surveys concerned with dietary habits and eating behaviours in a representative research sample of adolescents within the Czech Republic...|$|R
