40|$|Average steady {{source flow}} in {{heterogeneous}} porous formations is modelled by regarding the hydraulic conductivity K as a stationary random space function (RSF). As a consequence, the flow variables become RSFs as well, {{and we are}} interested into calculating their moments. This problem has been intensively studied {{in the case of}} a Neumann type boundary condition at the source. However, there are many applications (such as well-type flows) for which the required boundary condition is that of Dirichlet. In order to fulfill such a requirement the strength of the source must be proportional to K(x), and therefore the source itself results a RSF. To solve flows driven by sources whose strength is spatially variable, we have used a perturbation procedure similar to that developed by Indelman and Abramovich (1994) to analyze flows generated by sources of deterministic strength. Due to the linearity of the mathematical problem, we have focused on the explicit derivation of the mean head distribution G generated by a unit pulse. Such a distribution represents the fundamental solution to the average flow equations, and it is termed as mean Green function. The general results are subsequently used to investigate flow toward a <b>partially-penetrating</b> <b>well</b> in a semi-infinite domain. Indeed, we construct a σ²-order approximation to the mean as well as variance of the head by replacing the well with a singular segment. It is shown how the well-length combined with the medium heterogeneity affects the head distribution. We have introduced the concept of equivalent conductivity...|$|E

The major oil fields in Vietnam such as White Tiger and Rang Dong consist of fractured and weathered granite basement formation which are several thousand feet thick and are difficult to drill through. Consequently, these fields have been developed with wells that are completed only in the top few hundred feet of the formation. Fluid flow into the partially-penetrating wells is therefore non-radial, rendering inappropriate conventional transient pressure analysis based on radial flow of the fully-penetrating wells. An analytical solution has been developed that describes transient pressure behavior of the partially-penetrating wells in naturally-fractured reservoirs. The solution is obtained by combining the pseudo steady state model for naturally-fractured reservoirs with the <b>partially-penetrating</b> <b>well</b> model in homogeneous reservoirs. Verification of the analytical solution is made by comparison of pressures derived analytically with those obtained from numerical simulation. The new analytical solution is presented in the form of type curves graphing dimensionless pressure and pressure derivative versus dimensionless time for various reservoir thickness, completion interval fraction, fracture-matrix storativity ratio, and interporosity flow coefficient. The new type curves indicate that partial penetration and double porosity effects cause a characteristic shape of the curves at early and transition time. Transient well test analysis based on a fully-penetrating well yields erroneous results when applied to partially-penetrating wells in naturally-fractured reservoirs. The new type curves are particularly useful in estimating the matrix-fracture parameters and other reservoir engineering parameters for partially-penetrated naturally fractured reservoirs...|$|E
40|$|Geological {{storage of}} CO 2 in deep saline {{formations}} {{is one of}} the promising ways to reduce emissions of CO 2 into the atmosphere. This is because of the mature technology {{as a result of the}} experience in oil and gas extraction and the fact that saline formations offer large capacity and immediate availability. However, not all saline formations are suitable for CO 2 storage. One of the important selection criteria for a suitable formation is the existence of sufficient injectivity. Injectivity simply shows how much CO 2 can be injected into a saline formation for a constrained pressure build-up. One of the most important constraints in CO 2 storage is to keep injection well pressure below formation fracture pressure. Otherwise, formation can be fractured which can create pathways for CO 2 to escape from containment. Hence, significance of estimating injectivity should not be underestimated. Analytical models are preferred in preliminary studies to estimate pressure build-up. This thesis presents new analytical tools to estimate pressure build-up at CO 2 injection wells in saline formations. The models developed in this thesis assume injection of CO 2 at constant rate through vertical wells into homogenous and horizontal formations of constant thickness. They model the effects of relative permeability, CO 2 dissolution in formation brine and drying-out on pressure build-up. Analytical solutions are presented for three types of formation outer boundary conditions: closed-boundary, constant pressure-boundary and infinite-acting formation. Using these models, transient pressure behaviour of fully-penetrating <b>wells,</b> <b>partially-penetrating</b> <b>wells</b> and multi-well injection are examined. The predictive capability of analytical models for each case is tested using numerical reservoir simulations. The results show a good agreement between the analytical and numerical computations. For <b>partially-penetrating</b> <b>wells,</b> a total skin factor which is composed of mechanical skin, partial penetration pseudo-skin and two-phase flow effects is introduced. Using the models developed for multi-well injection, the effects of number of injection and pressure relief wells as well as formation properties on total injection rate are studied...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} new method, the decoupled overlapping grids method, for the numerical modelling of transient pressure and rate properties of oil wells. The method is implemented in two stages: a global stage solved {{in the entire}} domain with a point or line source well approximation, and a local (post-process) stage solved in the near-well region with the well modelled explicitly and boundary data interpolated from the global stage results. We have carried out simulation studies in two- and three- dimensions to investigate {{the accuracy of the}} method. For homogeneous case studies in 2 D, we have demonstrated the convergence rate of the maximum error in the quantities of interest of the global and local stage computations by numerical and theoretical means. We also proposed a guideline for the selection of the relative mesh sizes of the local and global simulations based on error trends. Comparison to other methods in the literature showed better performance of the decoupled overlapping grids method in all cases. We carried out further investigations for heterogeneous case studies in 2 D and <b>partially-penetrating</b> <b>wells</b> in 3 D which show that the error trends observed for the 2 D homogeneous case deteriorate only slightly, and that a high level of accuracy is achieved. Overall the results in this thesis demonstrate the potential of the method of decoupled overlapping grids to accurately model transient wellbore properties for arbitrary well con gurations and reservoir heterogeneity, and the gain in computational e ciency achieved from the method.

40|$|A twenty-four hour, divergent-flow thermal tracer {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the usefulness of heat as a ground-water tracer. Bromide was used also in the experiment, {{as a means of}} comparing the thermal tracer to a conservative chemical species. Observations of pore-fluid temperature and bromide concentration were made at seven points within 3. 1 meters of a <b>partially-penetrating</b> injection <b>well.</b> Results show that temperature may be used effectively in the determination of aquifer heterogeneity and aquifer transport and thermal properties. Aquifer porosity was determined to be between 0. 35 to 0. 61.

40|$|Aquifer {{storage and}} {{recovery}} (ASR) {{is a particular}} scheme of artificial recharge of groundwater by injecting fresh water into aquifers and subsequently recovering the stored water during times of peak demand or extended drought. In the era of combating climate change, ASR, as an effective means for water reuse and sustainable {{management of water resources}} in concert with the natural environment, represents a huge opportunity for climate change adaptation to mitigate water availability stress. The success of an ASR scheme is quantified by the recovery efficiency (RE), defined as the volume of stored water that can be recovered for supply purposes divided by the total volume injected. It is not uncommon that RE may be significantly lower than 100 % because of the water quality changes {{as a consequence of the}} mixing between the injected water and native groundwater and the interaction between injected water and soil. Thus, the key of a successful ASR scheme is (1) to select appropriate aquifers and (2) to design optimal operational processes to build up a bubble of injected water with minimized negative impact from such mixing and interaction. To achieve this, this thesis develops an integrated knowledge base with sound interdisciplinary science and understanding of the mixing processes under operational ASR management in aquifers with various hydrogeological conditions. Analytical and numerical modeling are conducted to improve the scientific understanding of mixing processes involved in ASR schemes and to provide specific technical guidance for improving ASR efficiency under complex hydrogeological conditions. (1) An efficient approach is developed to analytically evaluate solute transport in a horizontal radial flow field with a multistep pumping and examine the ASR performance in homogeneous, isotropic aquifer with advective and dispersive transport processes. (2) Numerical and analytical studies are conducted to investigate the efficiency of an ASR system in dual-domain aquifers with mass transfer limitations under various hydrogeological and operational conditions. Simple and effective relationships between transport parameters and ASR operational parameters are derived to quantify the effectiveness and ascertain the potential of ASR systems with mass transfer limitations. (3) Effects of hydrogeological and operational parameters on ASR efficiency are assessed in homogeneous/stratified, isotropic/anisotropic coastal aquifers. Effects of transverse dispersion are particularly investigated in such aquifers.

40|$|ABSTRACT Aquifer {{storage and}} {{recovery}} (ASR) is used world-wide to supplement available water supplies by storing surplus water in aquifers and recovering it {{during periods of}} drought and increased demand. The use of ASR as an option for increasing available municipal irrigation and fresh water supplies is threatened {{as a result of}} the mobilization of arsenic in some aquifers during ASR. Arsenic is liberated from arsenic-bearing sulfide minerals {{as a result of the}} mixing of oxidizing injected water with reducing insitu groundwater. Fracture networks can have significant influence on the migration and distribution of arsenic in the Upper Floridan Aquifer (UFA) during ASR operations through effects on fluid flow, chemical reactions, and transport characteristics. To characterize fracture flow and associated mass transport, numerical three-dimensional models constructed with MODFLOW and FracMan are used to represent fractures in equivalent continuum, discontinuum, and stochastic discontinuum or discrete fracture network (DFN) dual porosity or hybrid models. The geochemical reaction (PHREEQC- 2) and transport (MT 3 DMS) models are coupled to the three dimensional numerical flow model (MODFLOW 2000) as PHT 3 D- 2003, and utilized to simulate the flow, transport, and inorganic reactions associated with the injection of oxidized water into the UFA of Southwest Florida during ASR cycles. The discrete fractures, implicitly simulated in MODFLOW as high flow zones, are model layers of varying thicknesses with uniform hydraulic conductivity and storage parameters, and as stochastically-generated horizontal and vertical fractures with varying physical attributes including orientation, aperture widths, fracture intensity, and fracture distributions, distributed within a lower conductivity matrix. Discrete fracture networks are simulated with FracMan and the results imported into MODFLOW. Although each fracture zone layer is assigned a unique stochastic distribution of hydraulic conductivity, each model represents a single realization. The FracMan output of stochastic distributions of hydraulic conductance and storage parameters is 2 ̆ 2 upscaled 2 ̆ 2 for use in MODFLOW. The vertical migration of solute due to variations in the density of injectate and groundwater does not appear to be a significant characteristic of the modeled flow system. The modeling results support the hypothesis that arsenopyrite, which is stable under reducing conditions, liberates arsenic during recharge cycles as a result of oxidation. The results also indicate that fracture flow significantly controls the distribution of all solutes affected by the ASR flow system due to the significantly higher transmissivity of the fractures compared to the matrix. The simulated distribution of arsenic in the matrix is significantly less than in the fractures as a result of the limited penetration of oxidized recharge waters into the inter-fracture matrix. Under the simulated aquifer and geochemical conditions, arsenic travels farther from the injection well via fractures than is observed in monitor wells, suggesting that the <b>partially-penetrating</b> monitoring <b>well</b> network does not intercept many of the fractures. The modeled increases in concentrations of arsenic in the ASR wells during the recovery cycles are also consistent with observations. Explicit representation of fracture zones in numerical transport models provides an increased understanding of the flow system and the potential occurrence and distribution of arsenic in groundwater...|$|R
