50|$|The {{calculation}} of the eco-costs is based on classification and characterisation tables as well (combining tables from IPCC (http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch2s2-10-2.html), the USEtox model (usetox.org), tables of the ILCD (http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pdf-directory/LCIA-CF-20-02-2013-clean.pdf), and RiskPoll (http://www.arirabl.org/Software_files/ExternE_2005_%28ERFs_and_UnitCosts%29.pdf)), however has {{a different approach to}} the normalisation and weighting steps. Normalisation is done by calculating the marginal <b>prevention</b> <b>costs</b> for a region (i.e. the European Union), as described above. The weighting step is not required in the eco-costs system, since the total result is the sum of the eco-costs of all midpoints.The advantage of such a calculation is that the marginal <b>prevention</b> <b>costs</b> are related to the cost of the most expensive Best Available Technology which is needed to meet the target, and the corresponding level of Tradable Emission Rights which is required in future. Example: For reduction of CO2 emissions to a sustainable level, the marginal <b>prevention</b> <b>costs</b> are the costs of replacement of coal-fired power plants by windmill parks at the sea.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} {{with the use of the}} cost of poor quality to identify areas for quality improvement, and to measure the results of the improvements. These improvements will show off in increased profit and increased customer satisfaction. A practically implementable method is developed for estimating and minimising quality costs in the manufacturing sector, and is demonstrated by 2 case studies. This method is based on the traditional Prevention-Appraisal- Failure (PAF) model. Three major modifications are made. The author argues that <b>Prevention</b> <b>cost</b> should not be included, due to the time lag before an increase in this cost pays off, and also because the collection of <b>Prevention</b> <b>cost</b> does not add any new knowledge. The External Failure cost is redefined to exclude warranty and liability cost. An attempt to include Invisible cost is made. In this way the customers view are incorporated into the model. The important thing about the model is not so much the absolute size of the quality problems in itself, but that the quality problems are identified and that the size of the problems is evaluated in monetary terms. Ranking the problems in monetary order is a good starting point for setting goals for quality improvements. The cost justification for attacking a specific quality problem can then be shown using Return On Investment (ROI), Residual Value and Net Present Value (NPV). The author argues that in general, NPV should be used to prioritise quality improvement projects. However, benefits that cannot be quantified, should at least be qualified and taken into account...|$|R
5000|$|Marginal <b>prevention</b> <b>costs</b> {{of toxic}} {{emissions}} {{are derived from}} the so-called prevention curve as depicted in Figure 2. The basic idea behind such a curve is that a country (or a group of countries, such as the European Union), must take prevention measures to reduce toxic emissions (more than one measure is required to reach the target). From {{the point of view}} of the economy, the cheapest measures (in terms of euro/kg) are taken first. At a certain point at the curve, the reduction of the emissions is sufficient to bring the concentration of the pollution below the so-called no-effect-level. The no-effect-level of [...] emissions is the level that the emissions and the natural absorption of the earth are in equilibrium again at a maximum temperature rise of 2 degrees C. The no-effect-level of a toxic emission is the level where the concentration in nature is well below the toxicity threshold (most natural toxic substances have a toxicity threshold, below which they might even have a beneficial effect), or below the background level. For human toxicity the 'no-observed-adverse-effect level' is used.The eco-costs are the marginal <b>prevention</b> <b>costs</b> of the last measure of the prevention curve to reach the no-effect-level. See the abovementioned references 4 and 8 for a full description of the calculation method (note that in the calculation 'classes' of emissions with the same ‘midpoint’ are combined, as explained below).|$|E

30|$|Parasitism, or more {{appropriately}} gastro-intestinal (GI) parasitism, {{is arguably the}} most serious parasitological constraint affecting small ruminants’ (e.g. goat, sheep) production worldwide. Economic losses are caused by decreased production, <b>cost</b> of <b>prevention,</b> <b>cost</b> of treatment, and ultimately through the death of infected animals (Barger, 1982; Donald et al., 1982; Perri et al., 2011; Mejla et al. 2011; Cringoli et al., 2004; Mes, 2003; Longo Ribeiro Vilela et al. 2012). The control of GI parasites traditionally relies on grazing management (Perri, et al., 2011), anthelmintic treatment (Costa et al., 2006) or both. However, grazing management schemes are often impractical due to expense or due to the hardiness of infective larvae on pasture. In addition, the evolution of anthelmintic resistance in parasite population threatens the success of drug treatment programmes (Craig, 2006; Prichard, 1990; Waller, 1994; Conder and Campbell 1995; Sangster, 1999). So, the aim of any parasite control program must therefore be to ensure that parasite populations do not exceed threshold levels such that eventual productivity rates are consistently compatible with expected levels of economic production.|$|R

The carbon productivity concept is a cause of production increase that offset production decrease factor depending on green-house gas reduction. The potential environment pollution index presents the possibility of environment pollution through construction phase. The carbon productivity is ‘Construction cost/Carbon emission’. The construction costs are consisted of material, equipment, labour cost and indirect expenses. Carbon emissions are calculated by emission for material production and equipment fuel consumption.
