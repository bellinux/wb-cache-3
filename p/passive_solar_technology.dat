40|$|AbstractThe heating {{problems}} of rural {{primary and secondary}} school must be solved urgently in Northwest China. However, central heating systems are difficult to implement in rural areas due {{to the level of}} economic development. It is known that the solar energy resources are much richer in Northwest China. So, it is possible to improve the indoor thermal environment using <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>technology.</b> In this study, the temperatures of three types of passive solar houses were calculated using dynamic simulation. The accuracy of the model was verified by experiments. Combined with the particular demands of rural school, the indoor environment is analyzed at different modes in different areas to determine the optimal type of passive solar house. These areas were divided into four zones: most suitable areas, more suitable areas, less suitable areas and unsuitable areas. The priority degree for different types of passive solar houses under different modes was determined...|$|E

This paper investigates a centralized photovoltaic and hot-water collector system that can serve as a water pre-heating system for a multistory apartment building in a warm climate region. Collectors are mounted on vertical facades. Electricity generated by the system is consumed by the circulation pumps and the water heaters.

40|$|The Thermal Test Facility (TTF) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado, was {{designed}} and constructed using a whole-building energy design approach. This approach treats a building as a single unit, not as a shell containing many separate systems. It relies {{on the use of}} energy simulation tools for optimization throughout the design process, and requires the involvement and commitment of the architect, engineer, and owner. It can produce a building that requires substantially less energy than a building designed and constructed with conventional means. TTF operating costs are 63 % less than those of a code-compliant basecase building. These savings were achieved by implementing an approach that optimized <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>technologies</b> and integrated energy-efficient building systems. <b>Passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>technologies</b> include daylighting, high-efficiency lighting systems, engineered overhangs, direct solar gains for heating, thermal mass building materials, managed glazing, and a good thermal envelope. The energy-efficient heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system, designed to work with the building's <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>technologies,</b> includes ventilation air preheat, ceiling fans, indirect/direct evaporative cooling, and an automatic control system.

40|$|After the {{oil crisis}} in the seventies, Europe started to rethink the energy situation. Buildings were {{recognised}} as a sector where energy consumption could be reduced by improving insulation. The application of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>technology</b> was also an option for building designers. An international effort was supported by DG XII (now DG Research) to develop policy, technologies and tools in the building sector. One of the RTD activities launched in 1985 was the PASSYS project. All Member States, at that time nine, joined the consortium, which aimed {{to create an environment}} for outdoor testing of building components and furthermore to develop analysis techniques for performance assessment under real climatic conditions. An additional objective was to develop reliable software tools for building simulation purposes. The interaction with architects and building designers lead to the development of simplified design tools. At the same time the European Commission was preparing a Directive for Construction Products that was finally adopted in 1989. A general characteristic of the period until 1995 was the development of a common infrastructure in terms of computer technology, software and hardware. JRC. H. 8 -Renewable energie...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} will overview UFM's Solar Energy Project, {{discuss the}} practical logistics of using passive and active {{solar energy production}} and will look at ways to share this information across Kansas and the region. UFM Community Learning Center's Solar Addition began as a demonstration of alternative energy and energy conservation in 1980 {{with the construction of}} the passive solar Green House. The initial project was funded with a grant from the U. S. Department of Energy and the City of Manhattan. It has served as a regional model of innovative uses of passive solar energy for many years. Recently, the facility has been renovated, updating examples of energy efficiency and adding a photovoltaic array to the existing passive solar features. The UFM Solar Project now provides a demonstration of both active and passive solar energy. The photovoltaic project, attached to Westar energy's electrical grid, went live in late July, 2008. Data collected from this project will show the production and cost savings of using solar energy to produce electricity. The UFM Solar Addition Project has two primary goals. The first goal is to create a regional demonstration project of alternative energy technologies. The project provides a demonstration of practical, usable active and <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>technology</b> available for home and small-scale commercial use. Technologies include passive solar energy collection, using a greenhouse wall with movable insulation, a demonstration of active photovoltaic technology collecting and using the sun's energy for electricity, energy conservation through windows, doors and strategic sun shading. The second goal is to provide unique educational programming to K-State, the Manhattan community and to the region utilizing the updated UFM Solar Addition facility. Classes, tours, demonstrations, and production greenhouse activities are available. Information on the advantages and challenges of alternative energy will be discussed. An outgrowth of the active photovoltaic technology has been the opportunity to advance the agenda of grid-connected solar technology use and energy policy in Kansas. The presenters can provide insight and suggestions on how to work with energy companies to move the region closer to small consumer use of grid-connected solar arrays...|$|E

40|$|The {{heat pipe}} {{augmented}} solar wall operates much more efficiently for domestic air heating than alternative <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>technologies.</b> The thermal diode effect of heat pipes reduces the insulating losses {{of the unit}} during nighttime and adverse solar conditions. The exceptionally high conductivity of heat pipes allows for much greater heat gains, and significantly reduces the response time of the unit. The response time is also reduced by a smaller thermal mass of preheating components, which allows the system to passively alternate between insulating and heating conditions much more quickly. By separating the thermal mass of the system from external cold temperatures {{through the use of}} insulation and heat pipes, the insulation values of the unit are larger than that of other passive devices. A heat pipe augmented solar wall was designed with emphasis on thermal efficiency and mass manufacturing techniques. Design drafts, solid models, and assembly and production instructions were created to assist and spur future production of these units. Detailed consumer and producer economic analysis of the unit was also performed. The cost of the approximately four foot wide by seven foot tall domestic heating unit to be produced, shipped, and installed is projected to be $ 1580 with current tax credits. Economic analysis yielded a payback period of 14 years and a 30 year return on investment of 130 % based on Louisville, KY weather and East Central United States utilities.
