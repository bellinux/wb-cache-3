40|$|Graduation date: 1983 <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this {{research}} was to compare two instructional programs of inservice training on Personal Hygiene for hospital foodservice employees for knowledge retention and cost effectiveness. The two instructional methods used were lecture discussion with a script and transparencies and the individual instruction with cassette tape and slides. The population sample was ninety-five foodservice employees from five Oregon hospitals. Forty-eight foodservice employees comprised the lecture discussion group and forty-seven foodservice employees comprised the individual instruction group. A demographic profile identified eighty-one <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foodservice employees as having four years or less work experience at their hospital in foodservice. Sixty-nine <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hospital employees had a job title of foodservice worker. Sixty-five <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> population also had previous training in Personal Hygiene. The evaluation tools were a pre and post test consisting of 25 multiple choice items and a time log to record instructor's time involved in preparation and administration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instruction. Each method was evaluated for knowledge retained using <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> covariance at <b>the</b> P =. 05 level of significance. Then each method was also evaluated for cost effectiveness which included both instructor and <b>participant</b> time and <b>the</b> materials cost.
