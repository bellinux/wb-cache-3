40|$|The authors {{determine}} {{the utility of}} applying two display design principles toward the development of interfaces for engineering design. The first <b>principle,</b> called the <b>Proximity</b> Compatibility <b>Principle,</b> specifies that displays relevant to a common task or mental operation should be rendered close together in perceptual space. The second principle, called the Control-Display Compatibility Principle, stipulates that the spatial arrangement and manipulation of controls should be easily distinguishable. To examine the utility of both principles, the authors conducted an experiment comparing the ability of subjects to find effective designs using a separable versus a configural interface in a multi-objective engineering design task. Results suggest that the <b>proximity</b> compatibility <b>principle</b> is an effective indicator of task performance.

5000|$|Within {{the realm}} of social psychology, the <b>proximity</b> <b>principle</b> {{accounts}} for the tendency for individuals to form interpersonal relations {{with those who are}} close by. Theodore Newcomb first documented this effect through his study of the acquaintance process, which demonstrated how people who interact and live close to each other {{will be more likely to}} develop a relationship. [...] Leon Festinger also illustrates the <b>proximity</b> <b>principle</b> and propinquity (the state of being close to someone or something) by studying the network of attraction within a series of residential housing units at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). [...] Both of these studies provide evidence to support the fact that people who encounter each other more frequently tend to develop stronger relationships. There are two main reasons why people form groups with others nearby rather than people further away. First, human beings like things that are familiar to them. Second, the more people come into contact with one another, the more likely the interaction will cultivate a relationship. Also, proximity promotes interaction between individuals and groups, which ends up leading to liking and disliking between the groups or individuals. The aforementioned idea is accurate only insofar as the increased contact does not unveil detestable traits in either person. If detestable traits are unveiled, familiarity will in fact breed contempt. It could be that interaction, rather than propinquity, that creates attraction.|$|E

40|$|The article {{utilizes}} {{the imagery}} of stretching out and expanding for exploring what happens when medical practices and health working arrangements are temporally and spatially reconfigured. Based on the tenets of contemporary practice theory, and {{on the back of}} a three years' longitudinal study of telemedicine in northern Italy, the article investigates some of the practical issues raised by the subversion of the <b>proximity</b> <b>principles</b> that still underscore most current medical practices. The study argues that in order to cope with the expansion of their activity practitioners had to face three main practical problems: they had to redistribute their work and tasks among human and non-human elements, they had to reframe the ways in which the activity was made accountable, and they had to reconfigure the relationships between all those involved. The stretching out and expanding of medical practices in space and time implies thus much more than a simple redistribution of what was already there and it triggers profound changes which included the reframing of the object and content of the activity, the emergence of new artefacts and new identities, and the modification of the geography of the power positions between all those involved...|$|R

Hollands, Pierce, and Magee (1998) compared 2 D and 3 D displays for a trend estimation task {{and found that}} 2 D displays were better than 3 D displays for integrated tasks. These results were inconsistent with the predictions of the PCP. The present study added line and mesh connections to the integrated display format to make existing emergent features more salient. Four display formats were tested: 2 D, 3 D Control, 3 D Lines, and 3 D Mesh. Twenty-four participants completed 256 trials evaluating the effect of display format, vergence rate, vergence direction, and starting distance on trend estimation. Results showed advantages for the 3 D Mesh and 3 D Line displays. A general advantage was found for faster vergence rates, and converging trends when the lines start closer together.

Object displays formed with matched codes {{were more likely to}} facilitate compar-isons, whereas object displays formed from mixed codes were more likely to facil-itate conjunction identification.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{measures}} are enlisted in {{an explanation of}} some longstanding perceptual phenomena associated {{with an assortment of}} visual patterns. In following the <b>proximity</b> <b>principle</b> of Gestalt psychology, these are commonly based upon a statistical treatment applied to one or another of a hierarchy of distance measures. Following from this, some problems of visual perception are tackled in terms of an active perceiving mechanism, which generates transformations in the realization of object invariance in space and over time. This generative transformational approach is also employed in an account of perception of various patterns and visual illusions. Although a range of proximity measures is involved throughout, the nearest neighbour metric is staple. For perception of unstructured visual arrays, the contribution of distance mechanisms, particularly nearest neighbours, is shown to be important. For structured arrays, the contribution of distance mechanisms along with transformations is important. Information about relative positions of image elements permits the selection of transformations that reveal structure.

The HIPE theory assumes that people integrate both into causal models that produce functional attributions.

The object’s design history and an agent’s goal in using it constitute distant causes. When specified fully, the immediate causes are sufficient for determining the perceived function—distant causes have no effect (the causal <b>proximity</b> <b>principle).</b> When the immediate causes are ambiguous or unknown, distant causes produce inferences about the immediate causes, thereby affecting functional attributions indirectly (the causal updating principle).

However, proximity, similarity, and friendship are concepts with blurred edges and imprecise grades of membership.

Although in principle it may be thought that the use of fuzzy sets theory makes agent-based modelling more elaborated, in practice it saves the modeller from taking some arbitrary decisions on how to use crisp values for representing properties that are inherently fuzzy. The consequences of applying fuzzy sets and operations to define a fuzzy friendship relationship are compared with a simpler implementation, with crisp values.

The problem of the symmetries {{is also known as}} the competing conventions problem or simply as the permutation problem. In the literature, symmetries are mainly addressed in Genetic Algoritm based approaches. However, investigations in this direction based on other Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) are rare or missing. Furthermore, there are different and contradictionary reports on the efficacy of symmetry breaking. By using a novel viewpoint, we offer a possible explanation for this issue. As a result, we show that a strategy which is invariant to the global optimum can only be successfull on certain problems, whereas it must fail to improve the global convergence on others. We introduce the Minimum Global Optimum <b>Proximity</b> <b>principle</b> as a generalized and adaptive strategy to symmetry breaking, which depends on the location of the global optimum. We apply the proposed principle to Differential Evolution (DE) and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategies (CMA-ES), which are two popular and conceptually different global optimization methods.

In haptic enumeration, {{it has been shown}} that dividing the total number of items over the two hands can speed up enumeration. Here we investigated how spatial arrangement of items and non-items presented to the individual fingers impacts enumeration times. More specifically, we tested whether grouping by proximity facilitates haptic serial enumeration (counting). Participants were asked to report the number of tangible items, amongst non-items, presented to the finger pads of both hands. In the first experiment, we divided the tangible items in one, two, or three groups that were defined by proximity (i. e., one nonitem in between two groups) and found that number of groups and not number of items were the critical factor in enumeration times. In a second experiment, we found that this grouping even takes place when groups extend across fingers of both hands. These results suggest that grouping by proximity affects haptic serial enumeration and that this grouping takes place on a spatial level possibly in addition to the somatotopic level.

In order to clarify the role of salience of various graphical features in relationship to this principle, an experiment was conducted in which the effect of emergent features and the salience of both graphical indicators and emergent features (if present) was studied on integrated and focused task performance using a graph reading task. It was found that, though the principle was confirmed in this study if its relationship with salience is ignored, taking salience of both lower-order and higher-order graphical features into consideration can significantly complicate the basic form of the principle.
