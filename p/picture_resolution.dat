The monochrome 405-line standard remained in place until 1985 in some areas, and the 625-line system was introduced in 1964 and (PAL) colour in 1967. A demonstration of large screen three-dimensional television by the BBC was reported in March 2008, over 60 years after Baird's demonstration.|$|E

Besides pure streaming applications for uni-directional communication, bi-directional applications like video teleconferencing and multimedia messaging will become increasingly popular. The following paper aims to provide an overview about the implementation of an ASIC suited for mobile multimedia applications. The ASIC features a complete single chip solution for MPEG- 4 video coding and decoding, using <b>picture</b> <b>resolutions</b> of up to QCIF @ 15 fps and data rates up to 128 kbit/s based on several hardware acceleration components and an embedded processor.

A decoder that conforms to a given level must be able to decode all bitstreams encoded for that level and all lower levels.|$|E

50|$|Broadcast mega-events, {{particularly}} by radio, were not uncommon {{prior to the}} widespread adoption of television {{as a form of}} home entertainment. However, the affordability of television sets and other technological barriers kept television mega-events relatively uncommon until at least the 1950s and 1960s. As the entertainment value of televised mega-events increased with the addition of improved <b>picture</b> <b>resolution,</b> audio and production quality, so did viewership and the opportunity to reach large audiences. Simultaneously, television advertisements developed into increasingly sophisticated, persuasive and targeted forms of communication. Many of the earliest and most notable television mega-event advertisements are associated with the Super Bowl, but other similar mega-events such ESPN’s X Games have become in part defined by the advertising backdrop that accompanies them.|$|E

5000|$|The terms [...] "tuner" [...] and [...] "receiver" [...] {{are used}} loosely, {{and it is}} perhaps more {{appropriately}} called an ATSC receiver, with the tuner {{being part of the}} receiver (see Metonymy). The receiver generates the audio and video (AV) signals needed for television, and performs the following tasks: demodulation, error correction, MPEG transport stream demultiplexing, decompression, AV synchronization, and media reformatting to match what is optimal input for one's TV. Examples of media reformatting include: interlace to progressive scan or vice versa, <b>picture</b> <b>resolutions,</b> aspect ratio conversions (16:9 to or from 4:3), frame rate conversion, even image scaling. Zooming is an example of resolution change. It is commonly used to convert a low-resolution picture to a high-resolution display. This lets the user eliminate letterboxing or pillarboxing by stretching or cropping the picture. Some ATSC receivers, mostly those in HDTV TV sets, will stretch automatically, either by detecting black bars, or reading the Active Format Descriptor (AFD).|$|R

5000|$|The X in its callsign {{stands for}} [...] "Experimental", as WGBX (more {{primarily}} in the 1970s) was home to programming that was given a trial run on the lower-rated UHF signal before possibly moving onto the more-established WGBH-TV. Such Eastern Educational Network imports from the United Kingdom as Doctor Who were seen first or more frequently on WGBX, and one late 1970s local [...] "nightclub"-style variety show, Club 44, proved popular enough to be moved over to WGBH and retitled The Club. The station airs PBS programs that are not aired by WGBH-TV as well as additional supplemental programming. Reruns of the previous night's programming either from WGBH-TV or from WGBX-TV itself also makes up part of channel 44's programming schedule. WGBX also carries the digital subchannels owned by the WGBH Educational Foundation; this enables WGBH to maintain a full 1080i high definition <b>picture</b> <b>resolution</b> on its main channel 2 signal, without any loss in visual quality.|$|E
50|$|Carry one.carry allThe National Association of Broadcasters, {{which did}} not return {{requests}} for comment, {{is probably going to}} be unhappy because the FCC plans to allow DirecTV and Dish to down convert broadcasters’ HD signals to a less pristine <b>picture</b> <b>resolution</b> for several years.The satellite giants-which combined serve about 30 million pay-TV subscribers-convinced FCC officials that they lacked the channel capacity to provide every eligible station in HD immediately. They insisted that they needed several years to prepare for a full HD carriage requirement.HD signals stress capacity because they take up much more bandwidth than digital signal transmitted at lower resolution.The FCC’s HD rules for satellite were far more lenient than the ones originally proposed by FCC chairman Kevin Martin. He started off at full HD carriage in February 2009, coupled with a market-by-market waiver process.Martin scuttled his original plan after DirecTV and Dish Network complained that it was draconian and damaging to their ability to compete with cable.Instead, the FCC decided to give DirecTV and EchoStar until 2013 to carry all stations in HD within any market where they have elected to carry any station's signal in HD format.The “carry one, carry all in HD” principle kicks in when a satellite company starts carrying local signals in HD. DirecTV’s decision to carry local TV signals in HD does not force Dish to do likewise in the same market.|$|E

Video coding based on the tradeoff principle can achieve higher subjective quality at low bitrates, and significantly reduce the burden of decoders. Experimental results on both MPEG- 2 codec and H. 264 codec prove that the tradeoff principle is valuable and feasible for embedded systems.
