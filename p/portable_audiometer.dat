40|$|A {{random sample}} of 1, 083 people, drawn from the lists of two {{practices}} in Leeds, was used to estimate the prevalence of deafness among adults. A test for deafness (defined as failure to hear 35 decibels at 1000 Hz in one or both ears) using a <b>portable</b> <b>audiometer</b> proved simple to operate with little observer variation. Eight per cent of adults {{were found to be}} deaf. The prevalence of deafness increased with age and was lowest in social classes I and II; {{there was no significant difference}} between the sexes. Audiometry showed that 17 per cent of those who thought their hearing was abnormal had no recorded loss of hearing using the stated test and that 18 per cent of those who are deaf would be overlooked if the question “Do you think your hearing is normal?” was used for initial screening in general practice. Less than 20 per cent knew of any services or aids for the deaf apart from those available through general practitioners...|$|E
40|$|Portability of {{equipment}} is {{an increasingly important}} component {{in the practice of}} audiology. We report on a new device, the OtoID, that supports evidence-based ototoxicity testing protocols, provides capability for hearing testing on the hospital treatment unit, and can automate patient self-testing. The {{purpose of this article is}} to report on the validation and verification of the OtoID <b>portable</b> <b>audiometer</b> in 40 subjects both young and old, with and without hearing impairment. Subjects were evaluated by an audiologist using the manual hearing test program and then self-tested via an automated testing program. Testing was done in a sound booth and on a hospital treatment unit. Therefore, data were collected in four conditions (booth vs hospital unit and automated vs manual testing) and analyzed for testing bias, repeatability, and American Speech-Language-Hearing Association-significant ototoxicity false-positive rate. Repeatable hearing threshold results were obtained on all subjects who performed the test, regardless of hearing status or testing location...|$|E

40|$|Background : Wax in {{ear canal}} causes a {{sizeable}} burden on resources {{of health services}} to a country. Aim : The magnitude of impacted wax, its effect in a survey and cost of managing this problem were reviewed in 2002. Settings and Designs : A study was conducted during 1996 to estimate the magnitude and causes of hearing impairment and ear diseases in Oman. The authors further reviewed the data of community-based prevalence study to assess the role of impacted wax. Materials and Methods: Trained physicians used <b>portable</b> <b>audiometers</b> to test the hearing status of each ear. They used otoscopes to examine the ear. Persons suspected to have hearing impairment or ear disease were reexamined by audiologists and otologists to determine the causes of hearing impairment. The resources for managing impacted wax were also calculated. Results : In this survey, 11, 402 subjects of all ages were examined. Prevalence of impacted wax was 11. 7 &#x 0025; (CI 95 &#x 0025; 11. 1 - 12. 2). Impacted wax was significantly higher in females compared to males [RR = 1. 22 (CI 95 &#x 0025; 1. 10 - 1. 35) ]. It was more common in residents of regions with humid environment than those of regions with less humidity [RR = 1. 91 (CI 95 &#x 0025; 1. 67 - 2. 18) ]. Impacted wax in ear canal was associated with ear diseases. A total of 181, 000 Omani people were estimated to have impacted wax in the ear canal. Managing impacted wax could cost 3. 6 million US dollars to the ear care services. Conclusions : Impacted wax was a hindrance in the hearing survey, and countries should {{plan to deal with}} earwax in such surveys. Its impact on hearing impairment and resource burden should be considered while formulating polices for ear care...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND : This study {{determined}} {{the accuracy of}} pure tone air conduction (AC) thresholds obtained using a synchronous telemedicine approach without a sound booth in a rural South African community. The global need for increased hearing healthcare currently far exceeds the capacity for delivering these services, especially in developing countries. A tele-audiology approach using a <b>portable</b> diagnostic <b>audiometer</b> could provide the solution, enabling hearing assessments to be conducted remotely and without a sound booth. MATERIALS AND METHODS : Hearing thresholds in a sound booth and natural environment were obtained froman initial sample of 20 adults (age range, 19 – 63 years; mean age, 50 – 13 years; 55 %female), recruited from a rural agricultural community. A subgroup of 10 adults (20 ears) volunteered for the telemedicine threshold testing. AC thresholds (250 – 8, 000 Hz) were determined and subsequently compared in these environments. Typical threshold variability was determined using test–retest correspondence as a reference for the threshold correspondence using a telemedicine mode. RESULTS : Test–retest threshold correspondence in the booth and natural environmentswas within – 5 dB in 96. 7 %and 97. 5 %of comparisons, respectively. No significant differences were obtained in AC hearing thresholds determined in the telemedicine configuration comparedwith those recorded in the gold standard booth environment. Threshold correspondence between the telemedicine compared with booth and natural environments were within – 5 dB in 82 % and 85 % of comparisons, respectively. CONCLUSIONS : The current study demonstrates the validity of using synchronous telemedicine for conducting hearing assessments in a remote rural agricultural community without a sound booth.

40|$|Prevention and {{rehabilitation}} of hearing loss and tinnitus, {{the two most}} commonly awarded service-connected disabilities, are high priority initiatives in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). At least 4, 000 Veterans, most with significant hearing loss, will receive cisplatin this year, {{with more than half}} sustaining permanent hearing shift and nearly 40 % developing new tinnitus. With improved survivability following cancer treatment, Veterans treated with cisplatin are approached with the dual goals of effective treatment and preserved quality of life. This article describes COMP-VA, a comprehensive ototoxicity monitoring program developed for VA patients receiving cisplatin. The program includes an individualized pretreatment prediction model that identifies the likelihood of hearing shift given cisplatin dose and patient factors. It supports both manual and automated hearing testing with a newly developed <b>portable</b> <b>audiometer</b> capable of performing the recommended procedures on the chemotherapy unit during treatment. It also includes objective methods for identifying outer hair cell changes and predicting audiogram changes using distortion-product otoacoustic emissions. We describe this program of evidence-based ototoxicity monitoring protocols using a case example to give the reader an understanding of how this program would be applied, along with a plan for future work to accomplish the final stages of program development...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE : Sections of the {{community}} face barriers to accessing audiology services. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the barriers faced by people in typically underserved community settings and to provide audiology services in their natural environment. Information gathered by questionnaire was used to determine each site's candidacy as a potential tele-audiology site. METHOD : Sixty-three participants were recruited across 3 community sites that were identified as gathering places for individuals who experience barriers to accessing traditional clinical audiology services. Information about demographics and participant experience with barriers to access was gathered by a locally generated, self-administered questionnaire. Pure-tone air-conduction audiometric exams were performed on participants with an automated <b>portable</b> diagnostic <b>audiometer.</b> Afterward, the investigator provided counseling regarding hearing loss rehabilitation or hearing protection. Referrals were made when appropriate. RESULTS : Pure-tone averages were similar within sites but varied across sites. At least 30 % of individuals at each site reported they wanted to visit the audiologist more often. Each site reported different principal barriers to access, among them transportation, motivation, and money. Eleven individuals were referred to the next level of care. Questionnaire results revealed special accommodations should be considered at each potential tele-audiology site. CONCLUSION : The present study provided audiology services to individuals in their natural environment, identified many of the obstacles preventing individuals from pursuing traditional audiology services and provided information for the foundation of a tele-audiology practice.

40|$|Background: Hearing {{and vision}} {{impairments}} increase {{with age and}} are common risk factors for functional decline reduced social participation and withdrawal. Objective: Describe the hearing and vision of home care patients older than 80 years. Methods: Ninety-three older adults (80 + years) receiving home care were screened for hearing and vision in their homes. Data were collected using a HEINE Mini 3000 ® Otoscope to examine the eardrum and presence of earwax, an Entomed SA 201 -IV <b>portable</b> pure-tone <b>audiometer</b> to measure the pure-tone average (PTAV), a logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution chart to measure visual acuity (VA), and the Combined Serious Sensory Impairment interview guide. Results: Slight and moderate hearing impairments were found in 41 % and 47 % of the population, respectively (mean PTAV = 40. 4 dB for the better ear), and 40 % and 56 % had impaired and slightly impaired vision, respectively (mean VA = 0. 45 for the better eye). The participants' self-assessments of hearing and vision were only weakly correlated with PTAV and VA values. The visual function was significantly worse in men than in women (P= 0. 033). Difficulty in performing instrumental {{activities of daily living}} because of hearing and vision impairments was experienced by 17 % of the participants, whereas 76 % experienced no difficulties. When many people were present, 72 % of the participants found it difficult to understand speech. Nearly 30 % found it tiring to read, and 41 % could not read very small print. Conclusion: The patients’ self-assessments of their hearing and vision did not correlate strongly with their VA and PTAV scores. Asking the elderly about their overall hearing and vision ability is not sufficient for detecting sensory impairment, and asking more specific questions about what they could not hear and see was not an adequate indicator of the patients’ hearing and vision problems. To detect hearing and vision impairments among elderly home care patients, standardized measurements of their hearing and vision are necessary...|$|R

40|$|The global {{need for}} {{increased}} hearing health care currently far exceeds {{the capacity for}} delivering these services, especially in developing countries where the ratio of audiologists to the population is often less than one per every million. The imbalance is further compounded by the requirement for diagnostic assessments to be conducted in an audiometric (sound proof) booth, as {{a large proportion of}} the population has limited access to centres where these booths can be found. A tele-audiology approach utilising a <b>portable</b> diagnostic <b>audiometer</b> could provide the solution, enabling hearing assessments to be conducted remotely and without an audiometric booth. This would obviate the necessity for people from rural communities having to travel long distances, often with great difficulty and at great expense, to the nearest sound (audiometric) booth. An additional advantage would be that an audiologist could service a range of remote communities at the same time. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of pure tone air conduction (AC) thresholds obtained using a synchronous telehealth approach without a sound booth in a rural South African community. Hearing thresholds in a sound booth and in a natural environment were obtained from an initial sample of 20 adults (range 19 to 63 years; mean age 50 ± 13 years; 55 % female), recruited from a rural agricultural community. A subgroup of ten adults (20 ears) volunteered for the tele-audiology threshold testing. AC thresholds (250 - 8000 Hz) were determined and subsequently compared in these environments. Typical threshold variability was determined using test-retest correspondence as a reference for the threshold correspondence using a telehealth mode. Test-retest threshold correspondence in the booth and natural environments were within ± 5 dB in 96. 7 % and 97. 5 % of comparisons respectively. No significant differences were noted when AC hearing thresholds determined in the telehealth configuration were compared to those recorded in the gold standard booth environment. Threshold correspondence between the telehealth environment on the one hand and booth and natural environments on the other hand were within ± 5 dB in 82 % and 85 % of comparisons, respectively. The current study is the first of its kind to report synchronous telehealth hearing assessments conducted in a natural environment in a rural community. It demonstrates the validity of using synchronous tele-audiology for conducting hearing assessments in a remote rural agricultural community without a sound booth. It also highlights the potential for using non-clinical facilitators in remote locations, which could reduce the burden on the limited number of audiologists. These technologies make it possible for diagnostic hearing assessments to be included as part of a remote telemedicine kit and open up new possibilities in telehealth and tele-audiology support.
