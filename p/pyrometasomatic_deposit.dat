40|$|Sir: G. W. Walker and F. W. Osterwald have {{described}} a unique uranium deposit {{in a recent}} issue of your journal (1). I can take no exception to the article itself, since I have studied no specimens from the deposit and because the photographs are not clear enough to warrant an opinion. Figure 2 a, for instance, might as well (or even probably) indicate the product of groundwater alteration of pyrrhotite, as is shown in thousands of textbook type examples, and which is not at all surprising in a <b>pyrometasomatic</b> <b>deposit.</b> I must however comment on two points. I. The reference to work by Meister (2) and by Berg (3) is misleading, since both reports have been com-pletely superseded by later information, a fact that was clear to Berg before his death. The magnetite-hematite ores of Schmiedeberg, long viewed as pryometasomatic (contact metasomatic [...] Kontaktmetasomatisch in Ger-many), have been definitely shown to be sedimentary ores that were thermally metamorphosed by the Riesengebirge granite. The uranium deposit in these ores is now known to be younger (probably much younger) than even th...|$|E
40|$|The <b>pyrometasomatic</b> <b>deposits</b> at Iron Mountain, {{near the}} {{northern}} end of the Sierra Cuchillo in Sierra and Socorro Counties, New Mexico, have been formed through replacement of calcareous beds of Paleozoic age, generally at or near contacts with intrusive masses of rhyolite, rhyolite porphyry, aplite, and fine-grained granite. The metamorphism is probably mid-Tertiary in age. Its two chief products are (a) light-colored, dense, fine-grained granulites rich in diopside, clinozoisite, bytownite, and other iron-poor silicate minerals, and (b) coarser-grained, dark-colored, iron-rich rocks, called tactites. The spatial and temporal relations of these iron-poor and iron-rich contact rocks, not only to each other but to adjacent igneous bodies and to relatively unmetamorphosed beds, appear to have been determined in a regular and definite manner; this is discussed and illustrated in detail by several examples. The iron-rich <b>pyrometasomatic</b> <b>deposits</b> contain a large number of unusual minerals. Most remarkable are helvite and at least three other beryllium-bearing silicate minerals, which are known to occur in noteworthy concentrations in only one type of rock, a peculiar rhythmically layered variety of tactite to which the name "ribbon rock" has been given. The structure of such tactite is very conspicuous, and appears in section as thin, finely crenulated bands of magnetite alternating with similar bands of silicate minerals and finely crystalline fluorite. Concentric banding about fluorite-rich pods is common. Bodies of "ribbon rock" vary in size from inch-thick lenses to large masses amounting to thousands of tons; most appear to have formed along contacts between recrystallized limestone and massive magnetite-andradite tactite, chiefly by replacing fluids penetrating the limestone from fractures. The layered structure is interpreted as a diffusion effect. The formation of massive and "ribbon rock" tactites can be traced through a range of falling temperatures from a stage characterized by deposition from iron-rich vapors to a stage in which hydrothermal solutions were dominant. Both vapors and liquids appear to have been acid, and reducing conditions undoubtedly existed during {{the latter part of the}} hydrothermal stage. The occurrence of beryllium in "ribbon rock", but not in typical massive tactite may signify that its compounds in <b>pyrometasomatic</b> <b>deposits</b> are confined to rocks of hydrothermal origin. The occurrence of "ribbon rock" itself is suggested as a potentially useful clue for recognition of beryllium-bearing contact deposits elsewhere; at least two other occurrences of what apparently is "ribbon rock" have been described in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Gold-bearing {{deposits}} in north-central Nevada {{occur in a}} wide variety of geologic environments related to major stratigraphic and structural features. These environments include pre-Tertiary sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, granitic rocks, and volcanic rocks of pre-Tertiary and Tertiary age which have been complexly deformed. The deposits were formed during five principal intrusive metallogenic episodes; the oldest is Jurassic, two are Cretaceous, one early Tertiary, and the last, late Tertiary. Three major epigenefic groups of gold-bearing deposits are recognized: replacement deposits, disseminated eposits, and veins. The replacement deposits may be subdivided in order of decreasing temperature of formation into contact <b>pyrometasomatic</b> <b>deposits,</b> base-metal deposits, and peripheral gold-silver deposits. The disseminated gold deposits eem to be intermediate in mineralogy between the peripheral replacement deposits and low-temper-ature veins, but differ in that they contain only minor amounts of silver. They are here considered to be a distinct group. The veins are subdivided into two classes: veins in pre-Tertiary and granitic rocks and veins in or associated with Tertiary volcanic rocks...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{geological}} mapping {{of the interior}} of the Gaspe peninsula has been carried on only in recent years. Logan (1) as early as 1863, however, correctly interpreted the structure of the peninsula as a great east-west trending synclinorium. When the Federal lead - zinc and the Miller copper prospects were found just after the First World War, detailed mapping of the interior was commenced. The areal geology mapped by I. W. Jones in the district served as a basis {{for the study of the}} Miller properties. The mineralisation of the Miller claims is pyrometasamatic but, in certain respects, it differs radically from mineralisation of other deposits of this type in Eastern North America. In Gaspe, the grade of regional alteration of the Devonian rocks is very low, - comparable perhaps to that of the Trenton group in the St. Lawrence Lowlands. Certain rock 3 of Lower Devonian age, however, show contact metamorphism of a high grade over restricted areas. Mineralised skarns and porcellanites have been produced. <b>Pyrometasomatic</b> <b>deposits</b> of the skarn type in the Grenville sub-province are characteristically coarse in grain, and this and certain other features suggest that they were formed at great depths under considerable pressure. The skarns of the Miller deposits, on the other hand, are extremely fine in grain, and give evidence of shallow formation without extreme hydrostatic or tangential pressures. [ [...] . ...|$|R
