5|$|Many European {{models were}} tested for Helga Brandt {{including}} German actress Eva Renzi who {{passed on the}} film, with German actress Karin Dor being cast. Dor performed the stunt of diving into a <b>pool</b> <b>to</b> depict Helga's demise, {{without the use of}} a double. Strangely, for the German version Dor was dubbed by somebody else.|$|E
5|$|A {{circular}} {{hole was}} {{cut into the}} backdrop {{and covered with a}} transparent material. A strong light behind this hole represented the moon. The light was occasionally manipulated to suggest the passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the <b>pool</b> <b>to</b> be made of large mirrors but Pillet rejected this idea because of its cost. In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene.|$|E
5|$|NuScale's design {{does not}} rely on powered water pumps or circulatory equipment. The company claims it can shut down and {{continue}} cooling itself indefinitely {{in the event of}} a catastrophe. The devices are intended to be kept in a below-ground <b>pool,</b> <b>to</b> absorb the shock of earthquakes, with a concrete lid over the pool. In the event that AC power is lost for normal cooling systems, the pool water begins to absorb heat and boil.|$|E

50|$|Potassium peroxymonosulfate {{can be used}} in {{swimming}} <b>pools</b> <b>to</b> keep the water clear, thus allowing chlorine in <b>pools</b> <b>to</b> work to sanitize the water rather than clarify the water, resulting in less chlorine needed <b>to</b> keep <b>pools</b> clean. One of the drawbacks of using potassium peroxymonosulfate in pools is it can cause the common DPD #3 water test for combined chlorine to read incorrectly high.|$|R

5|$|The long-running HUG process {{complicated}} the RAAF's management of its fleet of F/A-18s. At any one time, {{the capabilities of}} individual aircraft differed considerably depending on their upgrades. Accordingly, the long-standing arrangement where aircraft were almost permanently assigned to each squadron {{was replaced by a}} system where they were pooled. Attempts to allocate Hornets with similar levels of modifications from the common <b>pool</b> <b>to</b> each squadron were not successful.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Mamilla Street {{extended from}} the Mamilla <b>Pool</b> <b>to</b> Jaffa Gate. Along this street, wealthy Arabs constructed homes, offices and stores in the 1800s. Toward {{the end of the}} 19th century, and especially during the British Mandate era, the street became a fashionable commercial district. Both Arab and Jewish businessmen operated high-end shops for furniture, textiles, housewares, art, photography, and automobile showrooms.|$|E

Minehead Cricket Club, based at the West Somerset College in Alcombe, field four men's teams and one women's team while Minehead Hockey Club play close by at the West Somerset Sports & Leisure Centre. There were plans for a swimming <b>pool</b> <b>to</b> be built in the grounds of the West Somerset College and there is a bowls club on Irnham Road.|$|E
5|$|Monroe next filmed a {{scene for}} Something's Got to Give {{in which she}} swam naked in a {{swimming}} <b>pool.</b> <b>To</b> generate advance publicity, the press was invited to take photographs of the scene, which were later published in Life; {{this was the first}} time that a major star had posed nude while at the height of their career. When she was again on sick leave for several days, Fox decided that it could not afford to have another film running behind schedule when it was already struggling to cover the rising costs of Cleopatra (1963). On June 7, Fox fired Monroe and sued her for $750,000 in damages. She was replaced by Lee Remick, but after Martin refused to make the film with anyone other than Monroe, Fox sued him as well and shut down the production. The studio blamed Monroe for the film's demise and began spreading negative publicity about her, even alleging that she was mentally disturbed.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} prize {{pool was}} $2.13 million contributed by Riot Games, {{with the final}} amount being calculated after fan contributions stopped on November 6. Riot pledged to add 25% of all revenue generated from selling Championship wards and skins – customizations for the player controlled hero character – to the prize pool. On October 28, the sale of these unique Championship skins had grown the prize <b>pool</b> <b>to</b> $5.07 million, making it the largest single prize pool in League of Legends history. The final prize pool reached $6.7 million. Riot announced that 40% of the prize pool will be awarded to the winning team and 15% to the runner up. The winning team would also receive 25% of revenue from skins created to commemorate the championship victory.|$|E

25|$|St. Augustine was {{the only}} place in Florida where King was arrested; his arrest there {{occurred}} on June 11, 1964, {{on the steps of the}} Monson Motor Lodge's restaurant. The demonstrations came to a climax when a group of black and white protesters jumped into the hotel's segregated swimming pool. In response to the protest, James Brock, the manager of the hotel and the president of the Florida Hotel & Motel Association, poured what he claimed to be muriatic acid into the <b>pool</b> <b>to</b> burn the protesters.
