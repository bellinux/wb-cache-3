40|$|The {{development}} {{works of}} the high performance semiconductor photocathodes and the source-guns to produce highly polarized electrons for linear co liders and other accelerators have been conducted by our collaboration. The present status of our four research subjects, (1) superlattice photocathode development, (2) construction of polarized DC-guns, (3) study of surface charge limit phenomenon, and (4) study of field emission dark current problem for the spin RF-gun, are described from the view points of key technologies of <b>photo-emitter</b> polarized electron source. ...|$|E
40|$|A thermo–photovoltaic system (TPV) {{has been}} {{designed}} {{in order to provide}} electric power when batteries discharge in electrical vehicles. The system {{has been designed}} with a modular and integrated conception guaranteeing compact dimension and low weight. The liquid fuel fired ceramic combustor heats the selective <b>photo–emitter</b> that provides infrared radiation for the TPV system based on multi–quantum–well high efficiency cells. The thermo-fluid-dynamic behaviour of the system has been studied under steady state conditions by CFD simulations (3 -D). The optimization of the whole system has been performed by using a DOE – ANOVA statistical analysis. This allowed to identify the main parameters having any discrete influence on the system performance and to determine the best configuration in terms of both geometrical parameters and operating condition...|$|E
40|$|The {{electron}} gun for the SPEAR 3 injector operates {{with a warm}} thermionic dispenser cathode immersed in a 1. 5 -cell RF structure. At each injection cycle the gun accelerates several thousand electron bunches up to ~ 3 MeV during a 2. 5 us rf pulse. The individual bunches are then compressed by an alpha magnet and a travellingwave chopper selects 3 - 5 bunches so they don’t cause beam loading to the linac, where the accelerated bunches reach 120 MeV for subsequent capture in a single booster synchrotron bucket. Tests are underway to operate the dispenser cathode as a cold electron <b>photo-emitter</b> driven by an external laser system. Eventually, without the chopper, this will enable multi-bunch injections to the Booster and SPEAR 3. In parallel, tests are underway to evaluate quantum efficiency and beam emittance for a beam emitted from a CsBr photocathode with ns- and pspulses of UV laser light. In this paper we report on both the cold cathode {{electron gun}} operation studies for SPEAR 3 and the CsBr research aimed at developing advanced cathode materials for future applications...|$|E
40|$|Photoluminescence {{measurements}} {{have been}} made {{on a set of}} epitaxially grown strained GaAs photocathode structures. The photocathodes are designed to exhibit a strain-induced enhancement of the electron spin polarization obtainable by optical pumping with circularly polarized radiation of near band gap energy. For the case of non-strained GaAs, the degree of spin polarization is limited to 50 % by crystal symmetry. Under an appropriate uniaxial compression or tension, however, the valence band structure near the gap minimum is modified such that a spin polarization of 100 % is theoretically possible. A total of nine samples with biaxial compressive strains ranging from zero to {approximately} 0. 8 % are studied. X-ray diffraction analysis, utilizing Bragg reflections, is used to determine the crystal lattice structure of the samples. Luminescence spectra and luminescence circular polarization data are obtained at room temperature, {approx} 78 K and {approx} 12 K. The degree of luminescence circular polarization is used as a relative measure of the photo-excited electron spin polarization. The room temperature luminescence circular polarization data is compared with the measured electron spin polarization when the samples are used as electron <b>photo-emitters</b> with a negative electron affinity surface preparation. The luminescence data is also analyzed in conjunction with the crystal structure data with the goal of understanding the strain dependent valence band structure, optical pumping characteristics and spin depolarization mechanisms of the photocathode structures. A simple model is used to describe the luminescence data, obtained for the set of samples. Within the assumptions of the model, the deformation potentials a, b and d for GaAs are determined. The measured values are a = - 10. 16 {+-}. 21 eV, b = - 2. 00 {+-}. 05 eV and d = - 4. 87 {+-}. 29 eV. Good agreement with published values of the deformation potentials provides support for the model used to describe the data...|$|R
