In the ?rst part of the study, coal measure rocks in overburden strata were analyzed and the locations where possible fractures and bedding <b>plane</b> <b>separations</b> would occur were evaluated. In the second part, the hydraulic conductivities were computed by two different slug test analyses methods using the water level changes measured in gob gas ventholes as longwall face approached. Hydraulic conductivities were analyzed with respect to the changes in overburden depth, the locations of the borehole, and mine face advance rates. These data were used to interpret the potential productivities of the gob gas ventholes as a result of fracturing and changes in hydraulic conductivities. The general results showed that the probability of fracturing and bedding <b>plane</b> <b>separations</b> in the overburden increase between strong and weak rock interfaces. Also, the probability of bedding <b>plane</b> <b>separations</b> increases as the interface is close to the extracted coal seam. Evaluation of slug tests showed that the hydraulic conductivity developments in the boreholes and their potential production performances are affected by the underground strata and the roof materials. In situations where the roof material is stiff and thick, the development of high permeability fractures around the borehole will be less. Results also indicated that borehole location with respect to face position affects the fracturing time and permeability evolution as well. Greater overburden depths generally cause earlier fracturing as longwall face approaches, but eventually result in lower hydraulic conductivities and potentially less effective boreholes. Increasing mining rates also resulted in generally lower hydraulic conductivities in the overburden. The results of this study were intended to improve the interpretation of gob gas venthole performance and to provide better siting of these boreholes...|$|R

This led {{to the idea of}} primal separation algorithms, which are similar to standard separation algorithms but tailored to the primal context. In this paper we examine the complexity of primal separation for several well-known classes of inequalities for various important combinatorial optimization problems. It turns out that, in several important cases, the primal separation problem can be solved more easily than the standard one. This is a strong argument in favour of the primal approach. One of the most striking results is that there is an exact polynomialtime primal separation algorithm for a generalization of the so-called Chvatal comb inequalities for the TSP. No polynomial-time algorithm is known for the standard separation problem.
