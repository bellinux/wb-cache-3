BACKGROUND: Drug {{resistance}} indexes (DRIs) {{quantify the}} cumulative impact of antimicrobial resistance on {{the likelihood that}} a given pathogen will be susceptible to antimicrobial therapy. OBJECTIVE: To derive a DRI for community urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli in British Columbia for the years 2007 to 2010, and to examine trends over time and across patient characteristics. METHODS: Indication-specific utilization data were obtained from BC PharmaNet for outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions linked to diagnostic information from physician <b>payment</b> <b>files.</b> Resistance data for E coli urinary isolates were obtained from BC Biomedical Laboratories (now part of LifeLabs Medical Laboratory Services). DRIs were derived by multiplying the rate of resistance to a specific antimicrobial by the proportional rate of utilization for that drug class and aggregating across drug classes.

50|$|After {{a nonprofit}} {{organization}} has been formed at the state level, the organization may seek recognition of tax-exempt status with respect to U.S. federal income tax. That is done typically by applying to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), although statutory exemptions exist for limited types of nonprofit organization. The IRS, after reviewing the application to ensure the organization meets the conditions {{to be recognized as}} a tax exempt organization (such as the purpose, limitations on spending, and internal safeguards for a charity), may issue an authorization letter to the nonprofit granting it tax-exempt status for income-tax <b>payment,</b> <b>filing,</b> and deductibility purposes. The exemption does not apply to other federal taxes such as employment taxes. Additionally, a tax-exempt organization must pay federal tax on income that is unrelated to their exempt purpose. Failure to maintain operations in conformity to the laws may result in the loss of tax-exempt status.|$|R

The {{net effect of}} the HLT and financial distress ~from pretransaction to distress resolution, market- or industry-adjusted! is to increase value slightly. This finding strongly suggests that, overall, the HLTs of the late 1980 s created value. We present quantitative and qualitative estimates of the ~direct and indirect! costs of financial distress and their determinants. We estimate financial distress costs to be 10 to 20 percent of firm value. For a subset of firms that do not experience an adverse economic shock, financial distress costs are negligible.

The two most frequently used providers are medical doctors (MD) and doctors of chiropractic (DC).
