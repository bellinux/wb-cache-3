The College of Communication and the Arts was a department in the College of Arts and Sciences before being elevated in the summer of 2015.|$|E
5|$|There are 89hospitals in Virginia listed {{with the}} United States Department of Health and Human Services. Notable {{examples}} include Inova Fairfax Hospital, the largest {{hospital in the}} Washington Metropolitan Area, and the VCU Medical Center, located on the medical campus of Virginia Commonwealth University. The University of Virginia Medical Center, part of the University of Virginia Health System, is highly ranked in endocrinology according to U.S.News & World Report. Virginia has a ratio of 127 <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physicians</b> per 10,000 residents, which is the 16th highest nationally.

Design: A cohort from the Passports study with a mean follow-up of 219 (± 44) days postrelease. Associations were assessed using a multivariate Andersen-Gill model, controlling {{for a range of}} other factors. Setting: Face-to-face, baseline interviews were conducted in a sample of prisoners within 6 weeks of expected release from seven prisons in Queensland, Australia, from 2008 to 2010, with telephone follow-up interviews 1, 3 and 6 months postrelease. Participants: From an original population-based sample of 1325 sentenced adult (≥ 18 years) prisoners, 478 participants were excluded due to not being released from prison during follow-up (n= 7, 0. 5 %), loss to follow-up (n= 257, 19. 4 %), or lacking exposure data (n= 214, 16. 2 %). A total of 847 (63. 9 %) participants were included in the analyses. Exposure: <b>Primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physician</b> contact within 1 month of follow-up as a dichotomous measure. Main outcome measures: Adjusted time-to-event hazard rates for hospital, mental health, alcohol and other drug and subsequent <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physician</b> service utilisations assessed as multiple failure timeinterval data. Results: <b>Primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physician</b> contact prevalence within 1 month of follow-up was 46. 5 %. One-month <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physician</b> contact was positively associated with hospital (adjusted HR (AHR) = 2. 07; 95 % CI 1. 39 to 3. 09), mental health (AHR= 1. 65; 95 % CI 1. 24 to 2. 19), alcohol and other drug (AHR= 1. 48; 95 % CI 1. 15 to 1. 90) and subsequent <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physician</b> service utilisation (AHR= 1. 47; 95 % CI 1. 26 to 1. 72) over 6 months of follow-up.

25|$|There is {{currently}} a shortage of <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physicians</b> (and also other primary care providers) due to several factors, notably the lesser prestige associated with the young specialty, the lower pay, and the increasingly frustrating practice environment.

25|$|Emergency {{physicians}} are sometimes counted as <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physicians.</b> Emergency physicians see many primary care cases, but {{in contrast to}} family physicians, pediatricians and internists, they are trained and organized to focus on episodic care, acute intervention, stabilization, and discharge or transfer or referral to definitive care, with less of a focus on chronic conditions and limited provision for continuing care.|$|E
25|$|Studies of {{the quality}} of {{preventive}} health care find the opposite results: <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physicians</b> perform best.

25|$|Article 13 of the Law of Cohesion regulates {{characteristics}} {{of health care}} offered in Spain by medical specialists, which is provided {{at the request of}} <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physicians.</b> This may be in-patient hospital care or out-patient consultation at specialist centers or day hospitals. It includes care, diagnosis, therapy, rehabilitation and certain preventive care, as well as health promotion, health education and prevention of illness whose nature makes it appropriate to handle at this level. Specialized care guarantees the continuity of integrated patient care once the capabilities of primary care have been exhausted and until matters can be returned to that level. Insofar as patient condition allows, specialized care is offered in out-patient consultation and in day hospitals. As of 2010, Spain recognizes fifty distinct medical specialties.|$|E

25|$|A {{survey of}} 6,000 primary care doctors in seven {{countries}} revealed disparities {{in several areas}} that affect quality of care. Differences did not follow trends {{of the cost of}} care; <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physicians</b> in the United States lagged behind their counterparts in other countries, {{despite the fact that the}} US spends two to three times as much per capita. Arrangements for after-hours care were almost twice as common in the Netherlands, Germany and New Zealand as in Canada and the United States, where patients must rely on emergency facilities. Other major disparities include automated systems to remind patients about follow-up care, give patients test results or warn of harmful drug interactions. There were differences as well among primary care doctors, regarding financial incentives to improve the quality of care.|$|E
25|$|Residency as an {{opportunity}} for advanced training in a medical or surgical specialty evolved in the late 19th century from brief and informal programs for extra training in a special area of interest. The first formal residency programs were established by Sir William Osler and William Stewart Halsted at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Residencies elsewhere then became formalized and institutionalized for the principal specialties in the early 20th century. But even mid-century, residency was not seen as necessary for general practice and only a minority of <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physicians</b> participated. By the end of the 20th century in North America though, very few new doctors went directly from medical school into independent, unsupervised medical practice, and more state and provincial governments began requiring one or more years of postgraduate training for medical licensure.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, a Swedish {{pharmaceutical}} company, Kabi, contracted {{with a number}} of hospitals in Europe to buy pituitary glands for the first commercial GH product, Crescormon. Although an additional source of GH was welcomed, Crescormon was greeted with ambivalence by pediatric endocrinologists in the United States. The first concern was that Kabi would begin to purchase pituitaries in the U.S., which would quickly undermine the NPA, which relied on a donation system like blood transfusion. As the number of autopsies continued to shrink, would pathologists sell pituitaries to a higher bidder? The second offense was Kabi-Pharmacia’s marketing campaign, which was directed at <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> <b>physicians</b> under the slogan, “Now, you determine the need,” implying that the services of a specialist were not needed for growth hormone treatment anymore and that any short child might be a candidate for treatment. Although the Crescormon controversy in the U.S. is long forgotten, Kabi’s pituitary purchase program continued to generate scandal in Europe as recently as 2000.|$|E
