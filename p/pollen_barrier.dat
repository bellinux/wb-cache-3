While it stresses that any approach {{needs to be}} “proportionate to the aim of achieving coexistence”, very few studies have actually attempted to assess whether the proposed spatial ex ante coexistence regulations (SEACERs) satisfy this proportionality condition. In this article, we define proportionality as a functional relationship which is weakly increasing in the incentives for coexistence. We propose a spatial framework based on an existing landscape and introduce the new concept of shadow factor as a measure for the opportunity costs induced by SEACERs. This enables comparing the proportionality of (i) rigid SEACERs {{which are based on}} large isolation distances imposed on GM farmers versus (ii) flexible SEACERs based on <b>pollen</b> <b>barrier</b> agreements between neighboring farmers. Our theoretical and empirical findings argue for flexibility as rigid SEACERs violate the proportionality condition and, hence, are not consistent with the objectives of the EU...|$|E

5000|$|To limit mixing in {{the first}} stages of production, {{researchers}} and politicians are developing codes of good agricultural practice for GM crops. In addition to the thorough cleaning of machinery, recommended measures include the establishment of [...] "isolation distances" [...] and [...] "pollen barriers". Isolation distances are the minimum distances required between GM and non-GM cultivations {{for most of the}} GM pollen to fall to the ground before reaching non-GM plants. <b>Pollen</b> <b>barriers</b> attempt actively catch pollen, and can consist of hedges and trees which physically hinder <b>pollen</b> movement. <b>Pollen</b> <b>barriers</b> consisting of conventional crops of the same species as the GM crop have a special advantage, as the conventional plants not only physically limit the GM pollen flow, but also produce competitive, conventional pollen. During harvest, the buffer strip of conventional crops is considered part of the GM crop yield.|$|R
40|$|In {{their recent}} article in this journal, Demont et al. (2009) discuss the effects of {{alternative}} spatial ex ante coexistence regulations (SEACERs) {{in the context of}} the EU regulatory framework. We retain from Demont et al. (2009) that small <b>pollen</b> <b>barriers</b> should be considered as a possible regulatory option in all identifiable situations in which they are as effective as large isolation distances. This idea is in accordance with the proportionality principle of the 2003 EC Recommendation. But further analysis of how consumer choice and consumer welfare are affected should be conducted before supporting the idea that SEACERs should be flexible, that is that GMO farmers should always have the option of paying their non-GMO neighbours to implement the SEACERs in their own fields. We reject the authors' argument that <b>pollen</b> <b>barriers</b> are necessarily more easily negotiable among neighbours (more "flexible") than are isolation distances. We contest the relation of proportionality to the size of market signals for IP products. We contest the idea of shifting coexistence regulation from ex ante to ex post. We believe that any economic analysis of coexistence measures should include their welfare effects on consumers as well as on producers.

40|$|Member {{states in}} the European Union (EU) {{implemented}} both ex ante coexistence regulations and ex post liability schemes to ensure that genetically modified (GM) and non-GM crops can be cultivated side by side without excluding any agricultural option. Although proportionate coexistence is best achieved if regulated in a flexible manner, most implemented coexistence regulations merely rely on rigid measures. Flexible coexistence regulations, however, would reduce the regulatory burden on certain agricultural options and avoid jeopardizing economic incentives for coexistence. Flexibility can be integrated at: (i) the regulatory level by relaxing the rigidity of coexistence measures in ex ante regulations, yet without offsetting incentives to implement coexistence measures; (ii) the farm level by recommending the use of <b>pollen</b> <b>barriers</b> instead of large and fixed isolation distances; and (iii) the national/regional level by allowing diversified coexistence measures, which are adapted to the heterogeneity of farming in the EU. Owing to difficulties of implementation, the adoption of flexible and proportionate coexistence regulations will inevitably entail challenges. JRC.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Studies were {{conducted}} to determine {{the effectiveness of a}} biological <b>pollen</b> <b>barrier</b> of rye, Secale cereale, in preventing out-crossing between Lolium multiflorum genotypes in each of the 300 crossing blocks established in this experiment. Fluorescent tests of seeds of open-pollinated and single-crossed progeny of four annual ryegrass sources were used to determine the effectiveness of the rye barrier in preventing crossing between crossing blocks. The average percentage of fluorescence of open-pollinated progeny in 30 crossing blocks containing supposedly only non-fluorescing plants was 16. 3 percent. The open-pollinated and single-crossed progeny in 46 other crossing blocks were highly correlated and did not differ significantly from each other in percent fluorescence. The percent fluorescence of each crossing block was mainly due to intra-crossing block pollen rather than inter-crossing block or foreign pollen. The results indicate that an eight foot barrier of rye is effective in preventing crossing between the annual ryegrass crossing blocks. Self-fertility of Lolium multiflorum was generally low, but self fertility estimates ranged from 0 to 87 percent. The results revealed that self-fertility data obtained by germination rather than seed count may give more accurate self-fertility estimates, especially when individual plants and their differences are being investigated. The average seed set under white parchment bags was not significantly lower than the average seed set obtained with bag-type dialysis tubing. The use of dialysis tubing as a substitute for white parchment bags in bagging plants would be of little, if any, benefit to improve seed set under bag in Lolium multiflorum...|$|E
40|$|Europe is {{currently}} struggling to implement coherent coexistence regulations on genetically modified (GM) and non-GM crops in all EU Member States (EC 2006). Our {{concern is that}} some proposed measures may impose a burden on future GM crop production in Europe. So far, the coexistence debate has been mainly centred on costs, but very few {{studies have focused on}} the economic incentives for coexistence, i. e. (i) GM crop cultivation (in order to capture ‘GM gains’) and (ii) identity preservation (IP) of non-GM crops (in order to capture ‘IP gains’). Both incentives are vital; if one of them is lacking, strictly speaking there is no coexistence problem. Therefore, through landscape simulations we illustrate how the costs of spatial coexistence regulations can be related to these economic incentives. Spatial coexistence regulations include (i) isolation distances and (ii) pollen barriers planted with non-GM crops of the same species between GM and non-GM fields (EC 2006). In this article, we adopt the ‘newcomer principle’ and assume that GM farmers apply the measures. On the <b>pollen</b> <b>barrier</b> area the GM farmer foregoes the GM gains (opportunity costs = GM gains). In the case of an isolation distance, if a field is too close to a non-GM field of a particular crop, the field has to be planted with other crops or non-GM varieties of the same species. We assume that farmers will attempt to compensate the GM gains foregone by attempting to capture the IP gains (opportunity costs = GM gains – IP gains) status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|The {{cultivation}} area {{of genetically}} modified (GM) crops on the global scale is continuously increasing. In Europe, concerns by farmers and the public, however, make the coexistence of GM and non-GM crops critical in some regions. GM material may be transported into protected sites [1] or cross-pollinate neighboring fields with non-GM varieties [2]. Both pathways may cause unwanted effects, such as contaminate non-GM harvests above tolerance threshold for GM material [3, 4], or adversely affect trophic links and/or other processes within ecological communities [5 – 7]. For example, the lepidopteran-active Bt-maize events may do potential environmental harm to non-target lepidopteran species of conservation concern that inhabit protected habitats. This exposure {{can be reduced to}} a level of no or minimum concern by imposing isolation distances. To minimize cross-pollination and thus secure the freedom of choice for farmers and consumers, as well as to minimize environmental risks, GM cropping in many countries is regulated by coexistence measures [2, 8], including <b>pollen</b> <b>barriers,</b> flowering asynchrony and crop rotation. These measures are obligatory for GM crop farmers. The measures include minimum isolation distances between GM fields and non-GM fields [9] and, in some countries, to protected sites. Information on pollination distances, cross-fertilization rates, and on potential wild relatives serves as a basis for defining these isolation distances, issued by the individual EU countries. These distances vary considerably between European countries, with a minimum of 15 m to conventional maize in Sweden and a maximum of 800 m to organic maize in Hungary [8, 10]. Minimum distances of GM maize fields to protected sites in Germany are regulated by individual federal states and range between 800 and 1, 000 m; this is significantly more than the 30 m suggested, for instance, for the Bt-maize 1507 by the EFSA Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) [11].|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) is {{a popular}} perennial, non-bloating forage legume used for pasture, hay and silage {{throughout}} the temperate regions of Europe, Asia Minor, North Africa and North and South America. It {{is regarded as the}} most morphologically and biochemically variable species in the genus. Research investigating the relationships of morphological, ecological and genetic characteristics describing birdsfoot trefoil germplasm has not been done. This research was conducted to investigate if the geographic and ecological origins of birdsfoot trefoil genotypes are related to differences in: (i) crossing compatibility among diverse genotypes, (ii) morphological traits, (iii) PCR-RAPD banding patterns, and (iv) temperature response of chlorophyll Photosystem II variable fluorescence. The 28 genotypes were classified by morphological characteristics, 130 polymorphic random amplified polymorphic DNA bands, and eight ecological characteristics of the original collection sites. The ease of introgressing 27 exotic genotypes into other germplasm backgrounds was determined by using bidirectional crosses with a domestic and exotic genotype tester. The chlorophyll fluorescence transients ratios (FTR) were determined from eight genotypes that were selected by their ecological diversity with measurements made from 10 to 40 °C in 5 °C increments for 33 minutes from the time of initial dark adaptation in 3 minute increments. Morphological similarities among genotypes were related to the general geographic proximities of their collection sites and their genetic similarity based on RAPD markers. Utilizing genetic, morphological and ecological descriptions revealed combinations of variation among genotypes that would not be observed with single measurements. Incompatibility among crosses was expressed as either an inability of plants to set pods or F₁ progeny resulting from crosses producing inviable <b>pollen.</b> Reproductive <b>barriers</b> were environmentally neutral and randomly distributed through the among the genotypes. Intermediate crosses could be identified to bridge any combination of genotypes that were incompatible. The eight genotypes differed in their FTR responses and were grouped into two classes. However, no associations were found between genotype similarities by FTR with genetic or ecologic similarities...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—Pollens are {{important}} triggers for asthma but {{the mechanism of}} sensitisation to their proteins remains poorly understood. The intrinsic protease activity of some allergens may contribute to sensitisation by disrupting {{the integrity of the}} airway epithelial <b>barrier.</b> <b>Pollens</b> release a variety of enzymes, including proteases, upon hydration. The hypothesis that such enzymes might be able to damage airway epithelial cells was therefore tested.  METHODS—Diffusates from pollens of Lolium perenne (ryegrass), Poa pratensis (Kentucky bluegrass), Acacia longifolia (Sydney golden wattle), or Casuarina distyla (she-oak) were incubated with mouse tracheal epithelial cells in culture and cellular detachment was quantified using a methylene blue dye binding assay.  RESULTS—Diffusates prepared using 100 mg/ml of pollen caused detachment of 30 - 90 % of airway epithelial cells in separate experiments. Within each experiment comparable detachment was observed with all diffusates tested, although total protein in the diffusates varied markedly between species. Viability of the cells recovered after exposure to Acacia diffusate was higher than after detachment by exposure to Lolium diffusate. Cellular detachment by all of the diffusates could be almost completely inhibited by addition of 10 % serum. Aprotinin, an inhibitor of serine proteases, partially blocked activity in diffusates of Lolium pollen but not of Acacia pollen. In contrast, α 1 -protease inhibitor and secretory leucocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) were not able to block the activity of either diffusate at concentrations which inhibited cellular detachment by trypsin.  CONCLUSIONS—Proteases released by pollens are able to cause detachment of airway epithelial cells from their substratum in vitro and may not be effectively inhibited by endogenous antiproteases. ...|$|R
