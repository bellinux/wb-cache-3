40|$|This paper aims at {{testing the}} {{technology}} gap hypothesis {{in order to}} explain the growth patterns of European regions. After {{a review of the}} related literature, we construct a simultaneous equation model of cumulative growth where catching up is driven by "social capability". This model is applied on an extended sample of 153 European NUTS I and II regions. The estimates are used to cluster the sample of European regions with respect to their growth paths: regions converging to the economic performance <b>of</b> <b>frontiers</b> <b>regions,</b> regions converging to their own steady state and regions for which relative backwardness seems to be a recurrent issue of the growth mechanism. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} development <b>of</b> <b>frontier</b> <b>regions</b> has been neglected {{in the study}} of the Roman economy. Traditional core/periphery models suggest that frontiers were marginal zones dependent on a wealthy Mediterranean core, and this view has dominated scholarship for more than thirty years. In light of recent work on the Roman economy, it is clear that many old models need to be reappraised; this thesis examines the {{economic development}} <b>of</b> <b>frontiers</b> through the case study of the Rhine River Basin. This region formed one <b>of</b> Rome’s northern <b>frontiers</b> for more than 400 years and has a rich tradition of detailed archaeological and historical research. Using data from the Rhine frontier, this thesis re-examines the nature <b>of</b> <b>frontier</b> economies, arguing that they were dynamic, versatile, and complex rather than subaltern and undeveloped. A new model, based in the analytic framework of economic geography, is suggested as a replacement in order to appreciate the realities and potential <b>of</b> <b>frontier</b> economies.
