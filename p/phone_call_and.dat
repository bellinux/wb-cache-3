5|$|This film is {{important}} for being the debut of Marguerite Snow, who {{would become one of}} the most important actresses for the company. In an interview by Johnson Briscoe, Snow said that her career as an actress was an accidental one. A girl friend of hers suggested she come to the studio to see how motion pictures are made. There at the studio, Edwin Thanhouser asked her if she wanted to be in the film. Snow accepted and she took part in the production until the director asked them to go outside to shoot another scene. Snow then protested about going outside in such a costume and in winter and proceeded home. A week later she received a <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>and</b> ended up working for six more months before temporarily returning to the stage. Another baseball related film would be released later that year by the Thanhouser Company, The Baseball Bug.|$|E
5|$|On August 14, 2009, the National Transportation Safety Board {{released}} a report regarding the incident. The report discussed several aspects of the collision, including locations of origin of the aircraft, planned destination, and air traffic control communications. In addition, the report discussed how one of the controllers at Teterboro Airport was on a <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>and</b> did not warn the airplane pilot of the potential conflict. The National Air Traffic Controller's Union (NATCA) then issued their own press release disputing some of the phrasing in the NTSB's report. The NTSB then retracted some of its statements regarding the controller's part in the crash, saying that the controller could not have warned the plane about the tour helicopter because the tour helicopter {{was not on the}} controller's radar. The NTSB also removed NATCA as a party to the investigation as a result of NATCA's press release, as parties to NTSB investigations agree to let the NTSB control publicity during the investigation. NATCA may still submit information to the board regarding the accident, but they will not hold a seat on the investigation board.|$|E

When he tries to escape to the Jellyfish Fields, a mob forms and chases him, but is unable to catch him. Cannonball Jenkins, formerly a farmer and later on, a sailor, launches himself at SpongeBob, popping the pants and sending him plummeting to the ground.

[...] "It was outrageous to deprive men of water in the desert" [...] Elliott thundered. He was assured that the water would be available at 05:30 the next morning. Elliott was up at 05:00, and found many of his men had been unable to sleep due to their thirst, and were licking at the taps around camp. He found the camp's Chief Engineer who informed him that the Egyptian civil authorities had not provided enough water for the troops in camp, and that he had strict orders not to start the pumps before 08:00, as it would wake the II Anzac Corps Commander, Lieutenant General Sir Alexander Godley. Elliott remounted his horse and went to II Anzac Corps Headquarters, where he informed a yawning staff officer in silk pyjamas that unless the water was turned on in the next five minutes, the brigade would be assembling and telling the Corps Commander exactly what they thought of him. The staff officer made a <b>phone</b> <b>call,</b> <b>and</b> Elliott was warned that he shouldn't make such a fuss again.

500|$|In Entertainment Weekly, Alejandro Garay wrote, [...] "One of my {{favorite}} episodes of 2008 was Lost’s 'The Constant.' [...] It was a beautiful episode that made us fans {{fall in love with}} the show even more. [...] The creators managed to build momentum with smart narrative, by using the romance card to develop such a complicated topic as time traveling. [...] It was exquisite, mind-blowing, impeccably done, and unforgettable." [...] Bill Keveney of USA Today wrote that it is [...] "arguably the most highly praised episode of [...] well-received fourth season", while his colleague Robert Bianco deemed Henry Ian Cusick worthy of an Emmy Award nomination. [...] Patrick Day of the Los Angeles Times called the episode a [...] "mind-blowing tour de force". [...] Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune called it a [...] "for-the-ages episode" [...] with [...] "a classic Lost moment" [...] in Desmond and Penny's <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>and</b> [...] "an especially spine-tingling performance" [...] by Cusick. [...] Verne Gay of Newsday wrote, [...] "last night's forty-four minutes of Lost were among the most satisfying forty-four minutes in front of the tube in my life." [...] He added that [...] "it wasn't merely a brilliant episode, which pushed the mythology forward more rapidly and richly than any episode in my memory, but it was an emotional release … I actually cried when Penny and Desmond finally…connected" [...] and [...] "there wasn't one, single, solitary false note". [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that [...] "it was brilliantly executed, as both a brain-twister and as a love story" [...] with an [...] "outstanding" [...] performance by Jeremy Davies. [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as [...] "the best single outing since season 1's 'Walkabout'" [...] and named the phone call between Desmond and Penny the best moment of the season excluding any moments from the then yet-to-air season finale. [...] Nikki Stafford of Wizard described [...] "The Constant" [...] as [...] "mindblowing" [...] and cited it as [...] "the reason the hardcore fans love Lost." [...] Matt Roush of TV Guide said that [...] "the time-tripping went into overdrive with this week's brilliant episode … [...] worked beautifully as a showcase for Henry Ian Cusick as the tormented Desmond. [...] It was almost a stand-alone episode, a Twilight Zone/X-Files-style adventure with a start, middle and killer finish." ...|$|E
