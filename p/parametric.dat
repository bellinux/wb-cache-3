Wanting to work in a smaller company, he joined Groove Networks as vice president of sales, where he worked from 2000 to 2004 before it was acquired by Microsoft and rebranded as Microsoft SharePoint Workspace.|$|E
5|$|Much {{research}} {{has been devoted to}} applications of photons in the field of quantum optics. Photons seem well-suited to be elements of an extremely fast quantum computer, and the quantum entanglement of photons is a focus of research. Nonlinear optical processes are another active research area, with topics such as two-photon absorption, self-phase modulation, modulational instability and optical <b>parametric</b> oscillators. However, such processes generally do not require the assumption of photons per se; they may often be modeled by treating atoms as nonlinear oscillators. The nonlinear process of spontaneous <b>parametric</b> down conversion is often used to produce single-photon states. Finally, photons are essential in some aspects of optical communication, especially for quantum cryptography.|$|E
25|$|Further <b>parametric</b> {{representations}} {{are given}} in the section <b>Parametric</b> equations below.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parametric</b> {{resonance}} {{occurs in}} a mechanical system when a system is parametrically excited and oscillates at one of its resonant frequencies. <b>Parametric</b> resonance takes place when the external excitation frequency equals twice the natural frequency of the system. <b>Parametric</b> excitation differs from forcing since the action appears as a time varying modification on a system parameter. The classical example of <b>parametric</b> resonance {{is that of the}} vertically forced pendulum.|$|E
25|$|The {{image of}} a continuous, {{injective}} function from R2 to higher-dimensional Rn {{is said to be}} a <b>parametric</b> surface. Such an image is so-called because the x- and y- directions of the domain R2 are 2 variables that parametrize the image. A <b>parametric</b> surface need not be a topological surface. A surface of revolution can be viewed as a special kind of <b>parametric</b> surface.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} {{complementary}} approachesand often non-overlapping sets of HGT candidatescombining predictions from <b>parametric</b> and phylogenetic methods can yield {{a more comprehensive}} set of HGT candidate genes. Indeed, combining different <b>parametric</b> methods {{has been reported to}} significantly improve the quality of predictions. Moreover, {{in the absence of a}} comprehensive set of true horizontally transferred genes, discrepancies between different methods might be resolved through combining <b>parametric</b> and phylogenetic methods. However, combining inferences from multiple methods also entails a risk of an increased false-positive rate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parametric</b> {{resonance}} {{occurs in}} a mechanical system when a system is parametrically excited and oscillates at one of its resonant frequencies. <b>Parametric</b> excitation differs from forcing since the action appears as a time varying modification on a system parameter.|$|E
25|$|Today's {{fields of}} {{interest}} among quantum optics researchers include <b>parametric</b> down-conversion, <b>parametric</b> oscillation, even shorter (attosecond) light pulses, use of quantum optics for quantum information, manipulation of single atoms, Bose–Einstein condensates, their application, {{and how to}} manipulate them (a sub-field often called atom optics), and much more.|$|E
25|$|Copulas {{are popular}} in high-dimensional {{statistical}} applications as they allow one to easily model and estimate {{the distribution of}} random vectors by estimating marginals and copulae separately. There are many <b>parametric</b> copula families available, which usually have parameters that control the strength of dependence. Some popular <b>parametric</b> copula models are outlined below.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parametric</b> {{resonance}} {{occurs in}} a mechanical system when a system is parametrically excited and oscillates at one of its resonant frequencies. <b>Parametric</b> excitation differs from forcing, since the action appears as a time varying modification on a system parameter. This effect is different from regular resonance because it exhibits the instability phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Cayley {{suggested}} the term <b>parametric</b> latitude {{because of the}} form of these equations.|$|E
25|$|In {{the optical}} <b>parametric</b> {{oscillator}} the initial idler and signal waves {{are taken from}} background waves, which are always present. If the idler wave is given from the outside along with the pump beam, then the process is called difference frequency generation (DFG). This is a more efficient process than optical <b>parametric</b> oscillation, and in principle can be thresholdless.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to make statistical inferences without assuming a particular <b>parametric</b> family of probability distributions. In that case, one speaks of non-parametric statistics {{as opposed to the}} <b>parametric</b> statistics just described. For example, a test based on Spearman's rank correlation coefficient would be called non-parametric since the statistic is computed from the rank-order of the data disregarding their actual values (and thus regardless of the distribution they were sampled from), whereas those based on the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient are <b>parametric</b> tests since it is computed directly from the data values and thus estimates the parameter known as the population correlation.|$|E
25|$|Estimation of such {{models is}} usually done via <b>parametric,</b> semi-parametric and {{non-parametric}} maximum likelihood methods.|$|E
25|$|As well as photons, phonons can {{interact}} via <b>parametric</b> down conversion and form squeezed coherent states.|$|E
25|$|Geometric {{objects are}} {{represented}} with <b>parametric</b> curves and surfaces or discrete models such as polygonal meshes.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} physical mechanisms {{that can be}} used to amplify a light signal, which correspond to the major types of optical amplifiers. In doped fiber amplifiers and bulk lasers, stimulated emission in the amplifier's gain medium causes amplification of incoming light. In semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs), electron-hole recombination occurs. In Raman amplifiers, Raman scattering of incoming light with phonons in the lattice of the gain medium produces photons coherent with the incoming photons. <b>Parametric</b> amplifiers use <b>parametric</b> amplification.|$|E
25|$|These {{equations}} are <b>parametric</b> in d. Setting d {{equal to}} any non-zero number and substituting it into these equations will yield one solution set.|$|E
25|$|A single {{parasite}} species {{usually has}} an aggregated distribution across host individuals, {{which means that}} most hosts harbor few parasites, while a few hosts carry {{the vast majority of}} parasite individuals. This poses considerable problems for students of parasite ecology, as it renders <b>parametric</b> statistics invalid. Log-transformation of data before the application of <b>parametric</b> test, or the use of non-parametric statistics is recommended by several authors, but this can give rise to further problems, so quantitative parasitology is based on more advanced biostatistical methods.|$|E
25|$|Hence these equations, {{which might}} be called {{functions}} elsewhere are in analytic geometry characterized as <b>parametric</b> equations and the independent variables are considered as parameters.|$|E
25|$|Laser {{spectroscopy}} uses tunable lasers {{and other}} types of coherent emission sources, such as optical <b>parametric</b> oscillators, for selective excitation of atomic or molecular species.|$|E
25|$|A <b>parametric</b> {{oscillator}} is a driven harmonic oscillator {{in which}} the drive energy is provided by varying {{the parameters of the}} oscillator, such as the damping or restoring force.|$|E
25|$|This {{reduces the}} <b>parametric</b> {{equations}} of motion of the particle to a cartesian relationship of speed versus position. This relation is useful when time is not known explicitly.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes it {{is useful}} to {{consider}} all functions with certain parameters as <b>parametric</b> family, i.e. as an indexed family of functions. Examples from probability theory are given further below.|$|E
25|$|Linkage {{analysis}} may {{be either}} <b>parametric</b> (if {{we know the}} relationship between phenotypic and genetic similarity) or non-parametric. <b>Parametric</b> linkage analysis is the traditional approach, whereby {{the probability that a}} gene important for a disease is linked to a genetic marker is studied through the LOD score, which assesses the probability that a given pedigree, where the disease and the marker are cosegregating, is due to the existence of linkage (with a given linkage value) or to chance. Non-parametric linkage analysis, in turn, studies the probability of an allele being identical by descent with itself.|$|E
25|$|Model-based {{approaches}} employ representation {{to extract}} vessels from images. Three broad categories of model-based are known: deformable, <b>parametric,</b> and template matching. Deformable methods uses objects {{that will be}} deformed to fit {{the contours of the}} objects on the image. <b>Parametric</b> uses geometric parameters such as tubular, cylinder, or ellipsoid representation of blood vessels. Classical snake contour in combination with blood vessel topological information can also be used as a model-based approach. Lastly, template matching is the usage of a template, fitted by stochastic deformation process using Hidden Markov Mode 1.|$|E
25|$|To infer HGT events, {{which may}} not {{necessarily}} result in phenotypic changes, most contemporary methods are based on analyses of genomic sequence data. These methods can be broadly separated into two groups: <b>parametric</b> and phylogenetic methods (see Figure 1). <b>Parametric</b> methods search for sections of a genome that significantly differ from the genomic average, such as GC content or codon usage. Phylogenetic methods examine evolutionary histories of genes involved and identify conflicting phylogenies. Phylogenetic methods can be further divided into those that reconstruct and compare phylogenetic trees explicitly, and those that use surrogate measures {{in place of the}} phylogenetic trees.|$|E
25|$|Above threshold, {{the pump}} beam {{depletion}} makes it {{sensitive to the}} quantum phenomena happening inside the crystal. The first measurement of squeezing in the pump field after <b>parametric</b> interaction was done in 1997.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parametric</b> {{resonance}} is the parametrical resonance {{phenomenon of}} mechanical perturbation and oscillation at certain frequencies (and the associated harmonics). This effect {{is different from}} regular resonance because it exhibits the instability phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|The Lehmann test is a <b>parametric</b> test of two variances. Of {{this test}} {{there are several}} {{variants}} known. Other tests of the equality of variances include the Box test, the Box–Anderson test and the Moses test.|$|E
25|$|A very directional, but low-efficiency, type of sonar (used by fisheries, military, and for port security) {{makes use}} of a complex {{nonlinear}} feature of water known as non-linear sonar, the virtual transducer being known as a <b>parametric</b> array.|$|E
25|$|The Sansa Clip+ proved {{popular with}} audio enthusiasts and programmers {{because of its}} very low cost, {{excellent}} DAC, and relatively mature Rockbox port. Rockbox substantially improves battery life and adds features such as <b>parametric</b> EQ, completely gapless playback and AAC audio playback.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 the International Chamber of Shipping and the World Shipping Council {{began work}} on a code of {{practice}} for container storage, including crew training on <b>parametric</b> rolling, safer stacking, the marking of containers, and security for above-deck cargo in heavy swell.|$|E
25|$|A <b>parametric</b> {{amplifier}} {{is implemented}} as a mixer. The mixer's gain {{shows up in}} the output as amplifier gain. The input weak signal is mixed with a strong local oscillator signal, and the resultant strong output is used in the ensuing receiver stages.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, Gunther joined Xerox PARC {{to develop}} <b>parametric</b> and {{functional}} test software for PARC's small-scale VLSI design fabrication line. Ultimately, he was recruited onto the Dragon multiprocessor workstation project {{where he also}} developed the PARCbench multiprocessor benchmark. This was his first fore into computer performance analysis.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{multi-storey}} {{car park}} opposite Selfridges on Park Street which {{is connected to the}} Selfridges store via a 37-metre long, curved, polycarbonate-covered footbridge, known as the <b>Parametric</b> Bridge, suspended over the street. On the ground floor of the car park there is retail space which was previously a furniture showroom.|$|E
