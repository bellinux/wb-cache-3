40|$|This paper advocates the <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> in {{a global}} context so that maximal {{individual}} and national development will be attained. The background to this study shows that education provides knowledge and skills, which enhance both individual and national development. The world has become a global village, but education is planned in the local context. Each country plans its education system within the local context, ignoring the exigencies of globalization. Existing data show that education {{is yet to be}} provided for all citizens in every country as advocated by the 1990 Jomtien Declaration. The development indicators also show that most regions and countries are below the world average. Hence, the need to change educational planning strategy worldwide. The paper concludes that <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> within the global context is the best way of enhancing both individual and national development, and thus, of improving individual livelihood. Background The essence of education is to develop the human potential in the three domains, cognitive, affective and psycho-motor.
