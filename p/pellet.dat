40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the effect of several process {{parameters}} used during <b>pellets</b> coating in two wurster fluid beds of different scales on: a) the uniformity of <b>pellets</b> coating, and b) {{the presence of an}} initial burst in the release profile caused by the existence of a significant fraction of <b>pellets</b> having a very thin film coating. The <b>pellets</b> used in this work presented high insulating properties. The <b>pellets</b> were coated with extended release films made mainly of ethyl cellulose and it was shown that larger <b>pellets</b> had a thicker coating. The choice of the process parameters had a large effect on the amount of <b>pellets</b> that were subtracted from the coating process due to the buildup of electrostatic charges on the <b>pellets.</b> Using not too high fluidizing air flows, <b>pellets</b> of larger size, a smaller <b>pellets</b> load and humidified air to fluidize the <b>pellets</b> resulted in more uniform coatings and, consequently, in more favorable release profiles that did not present or presented a reduced initial burst release...|$|R

5|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) {{has been}} a leader in laser-driven {{inertial}} confinement fusion (ICF) since the initial concept was developed by LLNL employee John Nuckols in the late 1950s. The basic idea was to use a driver to compress a small <b>pellet</b> known as the target that contains the fusion fuel, a mix of deuterium (D) and tritium (T). If the compression reaches high enough values, fusion reactions begin to take place, releasing alpha particles and neutrons. The alphas may impact atoms in the surrounding fuel, heating them {{to the point where they}} undergo fusion as well. If the rate of alpha heating is higher than heat losses to the environment, the result is a self-sustaining chain reaction known as ignition.|$|E
40|$|Administration of <b>pellets</b> in fed stomach {{state can}} prolong the gastric {{emptying}} of <b>pellets</b> {{in comparison to}} the administration under fasting conditions [1]. On the basis of literature data we aimed to investigate the influence of caloric value of food on gastric emptying of <b>pellets.</b> A systematic literature search on evaluation of human gastric emptying of <b>pellets</b> based on the technique of gamma scintigraphy was performed in the MEDLINE database. Studies estimating the gastric emptying of <b>pellets</b> under fedconditions were focused. In addition to the caloric value of the meal, a special attention was made on other factors such as, <b>pellets</b> size and density,pellets formulation (filled into capsules or compressed into tablets),a time delay for <b>pellets</b> administration in relation to the time of meal completion, and refreshments provision. The majority of <b>pellets</b> gastric emptying data was presented in terms of <b>pellets</b> t 50 values - a time when 50 % of the administered <b>pellets</b> emptied the stomach. In order to evaluate the influence of the caloric value of the meal on <b>pellets</b> t 50 values a linear regression model was built. In this model the caloric value was regarded as a categorical variable, which was recorded into dummy variables with the lowest caloric value set as a reference. In total 17 studies were recovered, however,only 6 of them met the selection criteria: <b>pellets</b> density between 1. 2 and 1. 5 g/cm 3, administration of the <b>pellets</b> at the time of meal completion, <b>pellets</b> filled into capsules, and <b>pellets</b> size in the range from 0. 6 to 1. 4 mm. In these studies 48 individual values of <b>pellets</b> t 50 were collected (6 or 8 subjects per study) and the obtained caloric values were 1200, 1500, 2300, 2800, and 3600 kJ. Mean value of t 50 of <b>pellets</b> administered right after the 1200 kJ meal was 136 min. In comparison to the 1200 kJ meal, the mean values of t 50 of <b>pellets</b> administered right after 2800 and 3600 kJ meal were significantly longer 212 min (p= 0. 031) and 263 min (p= 0. 003), respectively. No significant difference in terms of mean values of <b>pellets</b> t 50 could be noted between the 1200 kJ meal and 1500 or 2300 kJ meal.
