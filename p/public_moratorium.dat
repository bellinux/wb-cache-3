50|$|While the City of Cleveland, Ohio {{wanted to}} improve Municipal Stadium, Modell issued a <b>public</b> <b>moratorium</b> on discussions {{relating}} to the stadium issue {{for the future of}} his franchise. It was during this time that Modell entered into secret discussions with the State of Maryland to move the franchise to Baltimore for the 1996 season. The announcement of the move occurred several days before the public referendum on the extension of the sin tax that would fund the improvements on Municipal Stadium as Modell had originally requested. Modell wrote a letter to Cleveland's mayor Michael R. White and Ohio's governor George Voinovich saying that the passing of the referendum {{may not be enough to}} keep the Browns. Modell had lost $21 million in the previous two seasons. Modell also wanted that information to be made public. Commentators have speculated that the timing of the announcement was to cause the referendum to go down in defeat and thus allow Modell to make the case that he was not receiving the public support he needed to remain viable in Cleveland. Nonetheless, the referendum was passed by a wide margin. Modell was assisted in the move by Alfred Lerner, who would go on to become the new owner of the reactivated Cleveland Browns franchise in 1998. Modell's move returned the NFL to Baltimore for the first time since the Colts left for Indianapolis after the 1983 season. The reaction in Cleveland was hostile. Modell had promised never to move the team. He had publicly criticized the Baltimore Colts' move to Indianapolis, and had testified in favor of the NFL in court cases where the league unsuccessfully tried to stop Al Davis from moving the Oakland Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles.|$|E

During the moratorium period, new IPO regulations have been created and many Chinese companies have had to put on hold their desires to go <b>public.</b> The <b>moratorium</b> and the new regulations create new challenges and opportunities for Chinese companies and investors, which can be examined more fully by comparing the Chinese IPO and stock markets before, {{during and after the}} moratorium on IPOs...|$|R
40|$|Librarians {{working in}} the Irish health sector are under threat. This is a {{relatively}} young profession in comparison with international counterparts, with a low staffing base even at its peak. The <b>public</b> sector <b>moratorium</b> has led to professionally qualified librarians and library assistants not being replaced right across the health system. Librarians are employed in the HSE, voluntary sector, and university sectors. The value that this profession brings to healthcare has been documented in systematic reviews and literature in other countries. 1 - 4 In Ireland this group {{is represented by the}} Health Science Libraries Group (HSLG), a section of the Library Association of Ireland. The HSLG commissioned research into the status of the profession as well as Irish health libraries. This resulted in the publication of the “SHeLLI Report” 5 in 2011. Results of the report are outlined here and selected examples of value of librarians to healthcare are described...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this chapter is to review and critique the various strategies adopted {{in pursuit of the}} abolition of capital punishment and to proffer a model that is both evidence based and holistic in preparing for abolition and its aftermath requiring. In our opinion it is essential to such an approach that attention and resources are dedicated to improving legal services, prison and police practices, crime victims’ services, humane and proportionate alternatives to the death sentence, the public and elites’ knowledge about the death penalty and finally promoting a political philosophy that avoids reinforcing the myths of the benefits of capital punishment. The replacement of capital punishment and all its trappings should be addressed as a penal policy issue informed by reference to the wealth of available evidence. Paradoxically, abolition of the death penalty itself rarely leads to the improvements to the administration of justice that such a radical step would indicate and which abolitionists believe will follow the demise of the death penalty. Reliance by many abolitionists on the moral high ground can be counter-productive though that is not to deny that there is a moral and an emotional dimension. In this brief overview, we will address some of the most frequently cited justifications for the death penalty such as deterrence, retribution and incapacitation, as well as looking at the concept of abolitionism itself. Issues relating to the law, victims, <b>public</b> opinion, <b>moratoria</b> and alternatives to the death sentence will also be explored...|$|R

40|$|It is {{frequently}} claimed that nursing {{is vital to}} the safe, humane provision of health care and health service to our populations. It is also recognized however, that nursing is a costly health care resource that must be used effectively and efficiently. There is a growing recognition, from within the nursing profession, health care policy makers and society, of the need to analyse the contribution of nursing to health care and its costs. This becomes increasingly pertinent and urgent in a situation, such as that existing in Ireland, where the current financial crisis has lead to <b>public</b> sector employment <b>moratoria,</b> staff cuts and staffing deficits, combined with increased patient expectation, escalating health care costs, and a health care system restructuring and reform agenda. Such factors, increasingly common internationally, make the identification and effective use of the nursing contribution to health care an issue of international importance. This paper seeks to explore the nature of nursing and the function of the nurse within a 21 st century health care system, with a focus on the Irish context. However, this analysis fits into and is relevant to the international context and discussion regarding the nursing workforce. This paper uses recent empirical studies exploring the domains of activity and focus of nursing, together with nurses perceptions of their role and work environment, in order to connect those findings with core conceptual questions about the nature and function of nursing...|$|R

Another relative, Chief of the Circulation Police Department of Vlorë was also involved and all were sentenced or imprisoned. The opposition leader deputies of the Democratic party accused the government of strong implication in the tragedy and in involvement in clandestine trafficking. They asked for the resignation of the Minister of Public Order, Mr. Igli Toska, as well as the PM Fatos Nano. An atmosphere of discontent arose among the populace towards the government and some peaceful protests were held.On 3 March 2006, despite provoking a broad <b>public</b> debate, the <b>moratorium</b> on motor speedboats took effect; a three-year term law, banning all Albanian motor vehicle movement in the territorial waters of Albania.

40|$|This is the 6 th Annual Report of the Independent Monitoring Group for A Vision for Change (IMG) and {{the final}} report of the Second Group. It is clear to the IMG that the {{implementation}} of A Vision for Change (AVFC) to date including 2011 has been slow and inconsistent. There is a continued absence of a National Mental Health Service Directorate with authority and control of resources. Such a body {{has the potential to}} give strong corporate leadership and act as a catalyst for change. The absence of a comprehensive, time lined and costed Implementation Plan has made it difficult to put in place a consistent framework for the development of all mental health specialities and has led to a lack of coherency in the planning and development of community based services. Existing community mental health teams are poorly populated with an estimated 1, 500 vacant posts. These are mostly allied health professional posts. Consequently, the service that is delivered through medical and nursing posts is not based on multiple interventions as envisaged in AVFC. The effects of the HSE recruitment embargo and the <b>Public</b> Service <b>Moratorium</b> have disproportionately and indiscriminately reduced the availability of professional mental health service staff and reduced the overall volume of financial resources. There is an absence of the ethos of recovery and poor development of recovery competencies in service delivery resulting in a reactive rather than proactive approach to the needs of individuals and their families. The development of the National Mental Health Programme Plan (Clinical Programmes) is welcome although the IMG is greatly concerned that the principle of “Specialist within Generalist” framework will obstruct the development of specialist mental health care services and result in a modified version of AVFC. On a positive note, there is evidence of many local and regional initiatives being developed in line with AVFC. These are principally “bottom-up” developments led by local leadership. The HSE in combination with the Mental Health Commission has driven the continued closure of unfit for purpose facilities in favour of modern community based approaches. In respect of capital developments, progress has and is being made in the area of general adult mental health services, child and adolescent mental health services and forensic mental health services. What is still required to achieve full implementation of AVFC is an operational framework for the development of recovery competencies for all staff both at entry training level and ongoing in-service development. As a matter of urgency, the specialist mental health services for older people, rehabilitation and recovery, eating disorders, intellectual disability, co-morbid severe mental illness and substance abuse problems and others described in AVFC need to be fully developed and delivered. Government Departments, other than the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government need to focus on their responsibilities for the implementation of AVFC. In order for all of these actions to be achieved {{there needs to be a}} cultural shift in how mental health services are delivered. This involves moving from professional dominance towards a person-centred, partnership approach. There is also a requirement to move from a largely medicalised and maintenance approach towards one based on recovery competencies within the biopsychosocial model as envisaged in AVFC. Service responses to individuals and their families need to be proactive instead of reactive and be able to provide multiple interventions, as required. The principles and practices of a recovery oriented service appear to be developing in localised services and this needs to be encouraged and reinforced by a clear national corporate policy implementation framework...|$|R
40|$|A {{colleague}} and I attended a {{talk about a}} set of liver transplant experiments in mice, which the speaker had designed to undermine a commonly held immunological belief. My companion (who should have known better) afterward asked me rhetorically, 2 ̆ 2 What 2 ̆ 7 s next? Heart transplantation in a tadpole? 2 ̆ 2 When does the awe-inspiring {{give way to the}} commonplace? Technically wonderful surgery is considered ordinary not because it is commonly done but because the holder of this opinion has no image of the technique. Not long ago, resectional hepatic surgery was followed by the development of orthotopic liver transplantation. Although both techniques have matured into conventional therapy, such services are available only in specialized centres. In Japan, this progression failed to take place because perfused organs from deceased donors were unavailable. Despite laws recently passed that allow for the declaration of brain death, cultural inhibition to organ donation continues to prevent the use there of grafts from deceased donors. Japanese surgeons, in particular Dr. Koichi Tanaka, sought to make up for this deficit by using grafts of partial livers removed from living volunteers. Living-donor liver transplantation combines the techniques of hepatic resection and transplantation. The principal difference between living donation of liver and resection is the absolute requirement in the former to maintain the integrity of the liver {{on each side of the}} dividing line. To do this, the surgeon must retain the vascular supply and drainage of both sides throughout the dissection, up to the moment of graft removal. In this book, Tanaka and colleagues take us through the surgery in a manner that is at once detailed and exciting, through the generous use of magnificent electronic photography. New and more detailed knowledge of the structure-function relationship of the liver and its segments has been necessary to permit successful living-donor liver transplantation. This textbook begins with the selection and assessment of the organ donor. Radiological volumetric methods are clearly outlined; the estimation of functional reserve of liver segments is formulated. Colourful casts are used to demonstrate the liver 2 ̆ 7 s variable segmental anatomy. After the chapters dealing with graft retrieval, the authors illuminate recipient hepatectomy and graft implantation with the same ample supply of photographic figures. The excitement upon the reperfusion of a transplant is apparent even to the casual reader. North American readers may miss any detailed discussion in this book of the nonsurgical issues that surround living-donor transplantation. The results of now over 1500 liver transplants in Japan have proved to their volunteer donors and surgeons alike the value of the procedure in the care of patients with an otherwise fatal disease. In renal transplantation, an inverse relationship between deceased and living donation has been seen: where deceased donor rates are low, an increase in living donation compensates. The outcome of transplanted kidneys from living donors is superior to that from deceased donors. On the other hand, partial liver grafts from living donors are at greater risk of vascular and biliary complications than whole-organ grafts. They may also be more vulnerable to recurrent disease. In Ontario, the same inverse relationship is evident between the rates of living and deceased liver donation. This suggests a surgical reluctance to make use of a living donor. Because more people need liver transplants than there are organs (from any type of donor) available, this reluctance is deeply based. It concerns the fear of injury to the healthy donor. Among the 1500 Japanese donors there has been 1 death. For these volunteers, most of whom are closely related to the recipient, the risks are acceptable in context with the alternative. But in the USA, a single mortality of a donor in a successful liver transplantation program resulted in a <b>public</b> inquiry, program <b>moratorium</b> and considerable discussion in the press - much of which was about as well informed as the jaded comment about transplants in tadpoles. The excellent photography in this book, which matches the complexity of the surgery, will help bridge this gap. As a teaching tool, this well-priced text and its accompanying CD-ROM will be an accessible way to understand the liver...|$|R
