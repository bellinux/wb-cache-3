25|$|One {{potential}} {{strategy in}} STV involves casting a first <b>preference</b> <b>vote</b> {{for a candidate}} that has no chance of winning. This vote will then be transferred at full value and carry more weight in determining the winners at the later stages of the count. This strategy can be effective due to two features of some STV counting systems.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{constant}} {{media attention}} on preference deals, and a widely held {{belief that the}} two party preferred result for the election would be close, the Newspoll figures during the three {{months prior to the}} election showed little alteration in the first preference margin between the parties, nor was there any evidence of any voter volatility. The figures suggested, then, that as the Coalition's first <b>preference</b> <b>vote</b> was healthy, the most likely result was a Government victory. This was born out in the election results when the Liberal first <b>preference</b> <b>vote</b> of 40.5 per cent was 3.4 percentage points higher than in 2001, while Labor's first-preference vote of 37.6 per cent was its lowest since the elections of 1931 and 1934. Preference flows from minor parties {{are much more likely to}} affect an election outcome when the two major parties are close. The collapse of Labor's primary vote therefore negated this effect, even though 61 out of 150 House of Representatives seats were decided on preferences.|$|E

25|$|A {{consensus}} democracy, in contrast, {{would not}} be dichotomous. Instead, decisions {{would be based on}} a multi-option approach, and policies would be enacted if they gained sufficient support, either in a purely verbal agreement, or via a consensus vote—a multi-option <b>preference</b> <b>vote.</b> If the threshold of support were at a sufficiently high level, minorities would be as it were protected automatically. Furthermore, any voting would be ethno-colour blind.|$|E
25|$|The {{party had}} five TDs elected in the 2002 Irish general election, an {{increase}} of four from the previous election. At the general election in 2007 the party had expectations of substantial gains, with poll predictions that they would gain five to ten seats. However, the party lost one of its seats to Fine Gael. Seán Crowe, who had topped the poll in Dublin South–West fell to fifth place, with his first <b>preference</b> <b>vote</b> reduced from 20.28% to 12.16%.|$|E
25|$|Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party both {{continued}} to make gains, although the DUP vote share was slightly down. The election was {{a disaster for the}} Ulster Unionist Party, which came behind the Social Democratic and Labour Party in terms of first <b>preference</b> <b>vote,</b> although the UUP won more seats. The Ulster Unionist vote collapsed in Belfast, where it was eclipsed by the Alliance Party's, and {{in a number of other}} constituencies considered safe such as North Down. The election was also poor for the SDLP, which lost two seats.|$|E
5000|$|In STV elections, {{winning the}} quota (ballots/(seats+1)) of first <b>preference</b> <b>votes</b> assures election.

25|$|The 2014 Tower Hamlets Mayoral Election {{took place}} on 22 May 2014, {{concurrently}} with elections to all 45 seats on the Tower Hamlets London Borough Council, and the 2014 European Parliament election. Ten candidates stood for mayor, with incumbent Lutfur Rahman representing Tower Hamlets First and challengers representing the Conservative Party, Green Party, Labour Party, Liberal Democrats, UKIP, and TUSC along with 3 independents. Voting in the mayoral election was conducted using the supplementary vote system whereby the voter has the option to express a second preference choice, which would be counted in the event no candidate receives {{more than half the}} first preference votes and the second <b>preference</b> <b>vote</b> is for one of the two candidates with the most votes in the first round.|$|E
25|$|The Alliance Party {{performed}} well, {{gaining a}} second seat in East Belfast (which a former Progressive Unionist Party member lost and the PUP failed to regain), while increasing the Alliance vote share significantly. Traditional Unionist Voice secured a single seat in North Antrim; its vote share was {{down from the}} May 2010 elections to the UK Parliament. Despite their first <b>preference</b> <b>vote</b> halving, the Green Party held their sole seat in North Down while the People before Profit Alliance narrowly failed to take the final seat in the Foyle constituency. The only member elected as an independent in 2007 (in West Tyrone) retired, leaving a single independent in the new Assembly (after three independents first elected on other tickets had retired or lost re-election), compared to five {{at the end of}} the previous one.|$|E
25|$|Instant-runoff voting {{has been}} used to elect members of the Australian House of Representatives since the 1919 federal election, where it was {{implemented}} by the Hughes Government. The Australian Senate uses a modified form, combining it with a proportional representation method. Counting of the paper ballot papers proceeds and when no candidate receives 50% plus one vote of the 1st <b>preference</b> <b>vote</b> (candidates with a number 1), the candidate with the least number of 1st preference votes is eliminated and that candidate's votes are distributed to the 2nd preferred candidate. The process continues until a candidate accumulates 50% plus 1 vote, or a simple majority. Counting will continue to finality, which results in what {{is referred to as the}} two-party preferred vote, which expresses the electorate's voting preference equivalent to a 2-person election of the 2 most popular candidates. A normal Federal Senate election see 6 Senators elected from each of the 6 States (plus one from the Federal Territories of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital territory). To win a Senate seat candidates must accumulate a quota of the votes according to a formula. Most state and council (local government) elections also use the method.|$|E
2500|$|The number [...] "1" [...] {{or first}} <b>preference</b> <b>votes</b> are counted first. If no {{candidate}} secures an absolute majority (more than half) of first <b>preference</b> <b>votes,</b> then the candidate with the fewest votes is {{excluded from the}} count.|$|R

500|$|David Tonkin, an LM member {{before it}} split {{and became a}} {{separate}} party, had gained the Liberal party leadership in 1975, succeeding Eastick.

The 1977 state election saw a decline in Liberal support, but the party gained power after the abrupt resignation of Premier Dunstan, with an 11 per cent swing at [...] 1979 state election, receiving 55 per cent of the two-party-preferred vote. The first Democrats MLC was also elected in 1979 on a first <b>preference</b> <b>vote</b> of 6.5 per cent. In 1982, however, the Labor Party again gained office and would rule for over a decade.

2500|$|Despite {{the success}} of his career, the {{presence}} of Enríquez in modern Puerto Rican culture has been eclipsed by his clandestine counterpart, Roberto Cofresí. However, this process of romanticization began during the 20th century. Teacher, journalist and writer Enrique A. Laguerre wrote a novel dedicated to his memory, titled Miguel Enríquez: Proa libre sobre mar gruesa (lit. [...] "Miguel Enríquez, free life in a heavy sea"). Enríquez, who became the wealthiest man on the archipelago {{during the first half of}} the 18th century, is now considered to have been the first Puerto Rican economic force and entrepreneur. Historian and author Federico Ribes Tovar considered him a [...] "financial genius". Proposals to name a large cargo transport ship after him have been pursued, but with no success so far. In 2010 the ruins of a chapel that he built within El Plantaje in 1735, named Ermita de Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, was recognized as an historic monument by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico. Though the examples remain scarce, Enríquez has inspired other kinds of media. In 2007, the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture published a series of comic books named ICePé.cómic, with the 12th volume being Miguel Enríquez, corsario puertorriqueño (lit. [...] "Miguel Enríquez, Puerto Rican corsair"). In 2016, Raúl Ríos Díaz published the eponymous short documentary Miguel Enríquez, which combined his own research with Cantós' previous work, later winning a Gold Peer Award for best direction and the public <b>preference</b> <b>vote</b> at the San Juan Fine Arts Film Festival. As part of the Ibero-American branch of promotion for , Ubisoft published an [...] "affinity test" [...] that allowed players to gauge their relation to certain historical figures, among whom was Enríquez, who was listed under both variants of his name.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{different}} types of electoral systems create different incentives to cultivate a personal vote and that there may be variation in intra-party competition within an electoral system. This article demonstrates that flexible list systems - where voters can choose to cast a vote for the list as ordered by the party or express <b>preference</b> <b>votes</b> for candidates - create another type of variation in personal vote-seeking incentives within the system. This variation arises because the flexibility of party-in-a-district lists results from voters' actual inclination to use <b>preference</b> <b>votes</b> and the formal weight of <b>preference</b> <b>votes</b> in changing the original list order. Hypotheses are tested which are linked to this logic for the case of Belgium, where party-in-a-district constituencies vary in their use of <b>preference</b> <b>votes</b> and the electoral reform of 2001 adds interesting institutional variation in the formal impact of <b>preference</b> <b>votes</b> on intra-party seat allocation. Since formal rules grant Belgian MPs considerable leeway in terms of bill initiation, personal vote-seeking strategies are inferred by examining the use of legislative activity as signalling tool in the period between 1999 and 2007. The results establish that personal vote-seeking incentives vary with the extent to which voters use <b>preference</b> <b>votes</b> and that this variable interacts with the weight of <b>preference</b> <b>votes</b> as defined by institutional rules. In addition, the article confirms the effect of intra-party competition on personal vote-seeking incentives and illustrates that such incentives can underlie the initiation of private members bills in a European parliamentary system...|$|R
