50|$|Patrols {{ranged from}} 20 to {{as few as}} two Angels, though {{a minimum of three}} people was the standard. Members were {{assigned}} positions and specific locations in a patrol: the Patrol Leader was at the front; Communications was beside or behind; and Runners came next and would usually be the majority of the patrol, along with the second, {{who was in charge of}} keeping the patrol organized at the rear. Angels unable to go on patrols typically monitored the CB radio at the headquarters. Thus, a chapter could enlist volunteers who were legally considered handicapped. When a situation required immediate physical action on a patrol, the Patrol Leader would send the Runners under the direction of the second and either send the Communications person (with another Angel) to find a <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> <b>call</b> police, or to radio the situation to Chapter Headquarters to call a P.O.P. officer. When on bicycles, the second and a Runner would leave bikes with the Patrol Leader.

[...] After he discussed the script with Carol Rossen, who was to become his second wife, she responded, [...] "You're going to get on the <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> <b>call</b> Hollywood and tell them {{you want to do this}} part before they give it to somebody else," [...] and Holbrook did just that. He felt an emotional connection to the character in the film because at the time he had separated from his first wife and he hadn't told his two young children about the split. [...] "It was very easy and natural for me to translate the emotional turmoil I personally was feeling into the turmoil Doug was feeling." [...] The film remains important to him because it meant so much to so many people. [...] "That's a good reason for being an actor, when you can do something decent that touches people's hearts and their minds, so you feel like you actually accomplished something," [...] he says.|$|E

Jamal is furious and ends up on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?, because he hopes that Latika will see him on the show. He is not intending to get rich, but to get Latika's attention so she may find him again. He tries to stay on as long as he can, answering the questions based on his past experiences.
