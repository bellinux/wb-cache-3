On March 27, 2012, the ACLU reaffirmed its stance in support of the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling, at the same time voicing support for expanded public financing of election campaigns and stating the organization would firmly oppose any future constitutional amendment limiting free speech.|$|E
40|$|The frequency, {{duration}} {{and distribution of}} pauses in French were investigated acousti-cally in three types of <b>speech</b> styles: <b>political</b> interviews and casual interviews, which belong to spontaneous <b>speech,</b> and <b>political</b> <b>speeches,</b> which are carefully prepared. The speech samples were subdivided into articulated sequences, silent pauses, and non-silent pauses. The total time of silent pauses was 50 % greater in <b>political</b> <b>speeches</b> than in either type of interview. It appears {{to be one of}} the characteristics of <b>political</b> <b>speeches.</b> In all three styles, the distribution of silent pauses was generally correlated with the syntactic structure of the sentence. Most of the time, these pauses occurred at clause or phrase boundaries. In <b>political</b> <b>speeches,</b> however, their frequency was greater and their duration longer. Some of these pauses, particularly the long ones, must have a predominantly stylistic function. In inter-views, non-silent pauses were frequent and long, particularly in casual interviews, whereas they were almost completely absent in <b>political</b> <b>speeches.</b> These results confirm previous studies that involve other languages as well, and investigate the syntactic distribution of pauses and the importance of hesitation in spontaneous speech; they open onto a new research area concerned with the stylistic function of pauses...|$|R

5|$|In the Roman {{system of}} direct democracy, two primary types of gatherings {{were used to}} vote on legislative, electoral, and {{judicial}} matters. The first was the Assembly (comitia), which was a gathering that was deemed to represent the entire Roman people, {{even if it did}} not contain all of the Roman citizens or, like the comitia curiata, excluded a particular class of Roman citizens (the plebs). The second was the Council (concilium), which was a gathering of citizens of a specific class. In contrast, the Convention was an unofficial forum for communication. Conventions were simply forums where Romans met for specific unofficial purposes, such as, for example, to hear a <b>political</b> <b>speech.</b> Voters always assembled first into Conventions to hear debates and conduct other business before voting, and then into Assemblies or Councils to actually vote.|$|E

25|$|Breyer {{agreed that}} the First Amendment protections cannot be {{universal}} for plurality speech, <b>political</b> <b>speech,</b> or government speech. In instances where the speech of government employees is concerned, the First Amendment protections exist only when such protection does not unduly interfere with governmental interests.

However, prior cases did not decide what screening test a judge should utilize in circumstances where the government employee both speaks upon matters of public concern, and speaks {{in the course of}} his public employee duties.|$|E

40|$|This article {{suggests}} that the addressees as the dialogical ‘other’ loom large in monological <b>political</b> <b>speeches.</b> However, <b>political</b> <b>speeches</b> are produced under conditions of addressee heterogeneity, i. e. the speakers do not actually know who they will be talking to. It will {{be argued that the}} addressees are nevertheless a crucial element in speakers’ context models, that speakers orientate towards imagined addressees and that certain aspects – what possible addressees may do, think or believe and that they are a part of an imagined community – are particularly relevant from the speakers’ point of view. An analysis of addressee orientation in <b>political</b> <b>speeches</b> aims at reconstructing speakers’ conceptualisations of possible addressees. The analysis reveals patterns of addressee orientation which suggest that the addressees are framed in terms of presumed nearness (i. e. agreement) or distance (i. e. disagreement) to the speakers. Both presumed agreement and disagreement will be discussed in terms of how the speakers aim to impose their default perspectives on the addressees. The analysis is based on examples from a substantial corpus of German chancellors’ <b>political</b> <b>speeches</b> from 1951 - 2001...|$|R
