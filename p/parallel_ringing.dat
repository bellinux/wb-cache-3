Fast algorithms require less computer power and becomes possible to use them in the online reconstruction. In this contribution, the fast <b>parallel</b> <b>ring</b> recognition algorithm for the CBM RICH detector is presented. Modern CPUs have two features, which enable parallel programming.

40|$|This essay’s aim is {{to observe}} the {{electric}} field lines between two <b>parallel</b> <b>ring</b> conductors by drawing the equipotential lines of the conductor via voltmeter. The experiment is done by using a silver pen for creating the conductor. On a carbon sheet two circles which have the same centre but different radius are drawn with silver pen. The equipotential lines between these circles are drawn and the electric field lines are drawn according to equipotential lines. The method is easy to apply. In this experiment, as much data as possible must be collected, because the deviations can be unexpectedly high. So to find the approximate result, the number of data must be very high. Using 4 different voltage values (40 V, 30 V, 20 V, 10 V) about 600 data is collected. The test results show that except some data the values are mostly close to each other. That means proper equipotential lines are drawn. Since the electric field lines are drawn according to equipotential lines, the electric field lines could be drawn.

40|$|AbstractThe stent {{has been}} a major {{breakthrough}} for the treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease. The permanent vascular implant of a stent, however, changes the blood flow hemodynamics and may consequently affect the restenosis process. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been widely used to analyze the hemodynamic behavior and wall shear stress (WSS) distribution in stented arteries. The objective {{of this study is to}} present a thorough comparison among various CFD models to investigate the effects of rheological properties and pulsatile flow on hemodynamic simulation of the intra-stent blood flow. Several CFD models were developed with various modeling setups – axisymmetric <b>parallel</b> <b>ring</b> vs. 3 -D stented artery model, Newtonian vs. non-Newtonian flow, and steady-state vs. pulsatile flow. Simulated results show that the minimum WSS occurs at the recirculation zones located at the downstream or backside of each stent struts. The rheological effect on WWS is minor in the axisymmetric <b>parallel</b> <b>ring</b> model; however, it becomes slightly significant in the 3 -D stented artery model, with Newtonian flow being a more conservative assumption. For given pulsatile waveforms, the steady-state and pulsatile flow resulted in fairly similar trends in the WSS distribution. Therefore, it is reasonable to simulate the intra-stent blood flow as a steady-state Newtonian flow, which could be beneficial in more complex simulations and drastically reduce the computational time. These findings will provide great insights for future stent design optimization to reduce restenosis...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the current {{distribution}} {{in a set}} of <b>parallel</b> <b>rings</b> and patches, called islands, positioned at the surface of a cylinder, is investigated. The current is driven by an external applied source current. The islands are rectangular pieces of copper (patches) placed in <b>parallel</b> between the <b>rings.</b> The eddy currents in the islands induce currents in the rings that vary in the tangential direction. From the quasi-static Maxwell equations, an integral equation for the current distribution in the strips is derived. The Galerkin method, using global basis functions, is applied to solve this integral equation. It shows fast convergence. The global basis functions are built up of Legendre polynomials in axial direction and 2 p-periodic trigonometric functions in tangential direction. The Legendre polynomials efficiently cope with the singularity of the kernel function of the integral equa- tion. Explicit numerical results are shown for three configurations. Besides the current distributions, the resistance and self-inductance of the three systems of rings and islands are computed. The resulting tool can be used in the design of realistic gradient coils.

The issue of equivalence of orderings for one-sided Jacobi is also discussed.
