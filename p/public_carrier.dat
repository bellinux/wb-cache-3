5000|$|At common law, when {{goods are}} {{carried by sea}} by a “common carrier” (a <b>public</b> <b>carrier),</b> then, if the {{contract}} of carriage does not contain an exception clause relating to seaworthiness, there is an absolute undertaking that the vessel is seaworthy. Liability is “strict”**, meaning the carrier is liable {{even in the absence}} of negligence, as in Liver Alkali v Johnson. This does not mean the vessel need be capable of encountering any peril. The test of seaworthiness may be [...] "that the ship should be in a condition to encounter whatever perils of the sea a ship of that kind, and laden in that way, may be fairly expected to encounter in the voyage to be performed". However, the strict liability at common law is invariably modified in contracts of affreightment.

A common carrier holds itself out to provide service to the general public without discrimination (to {{meet the needs of the}} regulator's quasi judicial role of impartiality toward the public's interest) for the [...] "public convenience and necessity." [...] A common carrier must further demonstrate to the regulator that it is [...] "fit, willing, and able" [...] to provide those services for which it is granted authority. Common carriers typically transport persons or goods according to defined and published routes, time schedules, and rate tables upon the approval of regulators. Public airlines, railroads, bus lines, taxicab companies, phone companies, internet service providers, cruise ships, motor carriers (i.e., canal operating companies, trucking companies), and other freight companies generally operate as common carriers.

Robert Stephenson was the engineer {{in charge of}} the project, and he picked the site for the goods depot so that direct interchange with the Regent's Canal was available, from where freight could reach the London docks. A 25 acre site on the north bank of the canal was obtained from Lord Southampton in January 1837, and the goods depot was completed in 1839. Major features were a stationary winding engine house, which was used to pull trains up the incline from [...] to Camden, a shed for stabling of locomotives, 18 coke ovens which were used to make smokeless fuel, two goods sheds, stables for 50 horses, a wagon repair shop, and various ancillary buildings.

5000|$|Technology Historian Frederick C. Gamst {{writes in}} 2014 in [...] "": [...] What Is a Railroad?Sometimes an old line of rails is {{dismissed}} in an unreflective manner {{as not being}} a railroad, and is, then, labeled only a tramway. Accordingly, any discussion of railroad genesis must first reflect on the underlying question: What is a railroad? Using a core definition grounded in my research on present-day technological forms and functions, a railroad {{can be defined as}} an overland right-of-way bearing self-guided vehicles, which obtain support and guidance from wheels on rails. The guide way, or fixed path, consists of paired rails. These are elevated out of much of any debris strewn upon the way and the results of inclement weather. Self-guidance is accomplished by a flange, either on the vehicular wheels or supporting rails, usually the former. A hard wheel tread on a hard rail surface offers less friction and resistance than in ordinary vehicles on common roads. Not germane to the functional definition of a particular line of rails, and hence to questions of its classification as a railroad, are: the source of motive power, kind of material for rails and supporting ties (sleepers), varieties of things transported, or classification under law as a private or <b>public</b> <b>carrier.</b> From their modern English beginnings about 1600, all railroads are on one evolutionary continuum. Neither technological nor operational discontinuities exist regarding the devices and structures found on the steadily developing railroads. Frederick C. Gamst, University of Massachusetts, Boston This definition is minimal and purely functional. Prestige concerns do not make up any of its criteria. Accordingly, many an industrial project, some ephemeral and temporary had used and built railways that are not widely remembered or known by their important influence and effects in early times and which often extend through today. The list of railways here meet that test and more. They are largely and mostly chartered as common carrier enterprises, if chartered (at all) by a legislature after the early days. If wholly on private lands, they need not be chartered at all in many states, and would not be common carriers, but nowadays, even private ones are subject to some oversight [...] - [...] by the local building inspectorate and land regulators and the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Bureau of Mines, etcetera. No large business skates past some oversight in todays regulated business climate. [...] As today, in their formative years, most North American railways were and are in use to overcome the costs of transporting freight from place to place, especially bulk goods such as grains, ores, coal, gravels, and other raw materials such as those fabricated in processes such as steel, aluminum, concrete, etc. or are just bulky and unwieldy such as steel bridge girders, trusses, or timber (and better behaved lumber). Ironically, these are the same products (excepting steel goods) which the brief American Canal Age carried enabling the existence of the industries of necessary scale to be able to build a railroads many components. Without such service, much of the interior would be unproductively stranded without means of getting products in or out to markets. With the advent of the adolescence of the Iron Horses technologies in the 1850s, the interior of North America away from navigable streams could be and has been settled and exploited.|$|E

40|$|Some applications, {{including}} disaster {{monitoring and}} recovery networks, use low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN). LPWAN sensors capture data bits and transmit them to <b>public</b> <b>carrier</b> networks (e. g., cellular networks) via dedicated gateways. One {{of the challenges}} encountered in disaster management scenarios revolves around the carry/forward sensed data and geographical location information dissemination to the disaster relief operatives (disaster relief agency; DRA) to identify, characterise, and prioritise the affected areas. There are network topology options to reach its destination, including cellular, circuit switched, and peer-to-peer networks. In the context of natural disaster prediction, {{it is vital to}} access geographical location data as well as the timestamp.

40|$|The Fibre Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) {{represents}} {{the new generation}} of local area networks (LANs). These high speed LANs are capable of supporting up to 500 users over a 100 km distance. User traffic is expected to be as diverse as file transfers, packet voice and video. As the proliferation of FDDI LANs continues, the need to interconnect these LANs arises. FDDI LAN interconnection can be achieved in a variety of different ways. Some of the most commonly used today are public data networks, dial up lines and private circuits. For applications that can potentially generate large quantities of traffic, such as an FDDI LAN, it is cost effective to use a private circuit leased from the <b>public</b> <b>carrier.</b> In order to send traffic from one LAN to another across the leased line, a routing algorithm is required. Much research has been done on the Bellman-Ford algorithm and many implementations of it exist in computer networks. However, due to its instability and problems with routing table loops it is an unsatisfactory algorithm for interconnected FDDI LANs. A new algorithm, termed ISIS which is being standardized by the ISO provides a far better solution. ISIS will be implemented in many manufacturers routing devices. In order to make the work as practical as possible, this algorithm will be used as the basis for all the new algorithms presented. The ISIS algorithm can be improved by exploiting information that is dropped by that algorithm during the calculation process. A new algorithm, called Down Stream Path Splits (DSPS), uses this information and requires only minor modification to some of the ISIS routing procedures. DSPS provides a higher network performance, with very little additional processing and storage requirements. A second algorithm, also based on the ISIS algorithm, generates a massive increase in network performance. This is achieved by selecting alternative paths through the network in times of heavy congestion. This algorithm may select the alternative path at either the originating node, or any node along the path. It requires more processing and memory storage than DSPS, but generates a higher network power. The final algorithm combines the DSPS algorithm with the alternative path algorithm. This is the most flexible and powerful of the algorithms developed. However, it is somewhat complex and requires a fairly large storage area at each node. The performance of the new routing algorithms is tested in a comprehensive model of interconnected LANs. This model incorporates the transport through physical layers and generates random topologies for routing algorithm performance comparisons. Using this model it is possible to determine which algorithm provides the best performance without introducing significant complexity and storage requirements...|$|E
40|$|Summary: This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with describing the possible application of future air transportation systems within urban areas of the United States. The planning horizon extends to 1995 and the report focuses on the period 1980 - 85 for introduction of urban air systems. The general conclusion {{of the study is}} that urban air systems will be technically and operationally feasible, but that economic viability remains inextricably linked to future governmental policies on urban development, and consequently policies for development of urban transportation. In view of the uncertainties in these policies, it becomes difficult to be definitive about the forms of future urban air systems and the research and development needs to develop these systems. The marketing section of the report identifies the kinds of urban travel markets, and attempts to apply a modal split model to show the share of the travel market which an air system would capture in competition with automobile or new forms of rapid transit. The results indicated the need for a high frequency of air service, and low values of access and egress times and costs, and reasonably competitive fares. The air system did not gain any appreciable share of the travel until trip distances were over 20 miles. Since most of the trips in an urban area are under this distance, the overall penetration of the urban travel market was less than one per cent. Application of the modal split model to data for a 1980 case study of the Boston area indicated that the loads were much too low to justify a large scale urban system. Although the modal split model results can be questioned and more work on such models is indicated, the general nature of these marketing conclusions is unlikely to change. There were two concepts for urban air systems described in this study: a "metrobus" concept which used 40 - 80 passenger vehicles as a <b>public</b> <b>carrier</b> in the urban area and a "metrotaxi" concept which used 4 - 5 passenger VTOL air taxis as a private-for-hire carrier. The components of these systems (vehicles, metroports, air traffic control system) were described as they might exist for the 1980 - 85 period. Appendix B describes an analysis for any public urban transportation system which demonstrates {{that a large number of}} stopping points are required of a large scale urban system in order to reduce the access and egress times and therefore the total trip time. Its conclusion is that a public urban system can never compete with a private system like the automobile for the total mass market, but must attract a much reduced travel volume consisting of trips between local areas surrounding its stopping points. This result led to access plus egress times for the air urban system on the order of 30 minutes by automobile or taxi which greatly reduced its speed advantage particularly for the shorter trips. The dominant problem in implementing an urban air system is community acceptance of the metroport, and the prime factor would be the noise of the air vehicles. A peak noise level of 85 EPndb at 500 feet is suggested as acceptable based on experience with 70 heliports in the Boston area. However, there is a need for establishing a community noise criteria based on factors other than peak noise such as frequency of service, background noise levels, number of listeners, etc. and using it to establish noise categories for metroport operation. This would give the community some assurance that the volume of noise pollution from the site can be controlled. Planning for a future urban air system is linked to planning for both future airport development and future intercity V /STOL systems. Land side congestion problems at major airports can be relieved through the provision of remote check in facilities which have an air link to the airport. The construction of new airports at sites somewhat removed from urban areas may become reasonable if urban air service exists. Similar factors affect the problems of passengers transferring from airports to metroports for intercity V/STOL service. The metroports are a ground facility common to the metrobus concept for urban air systems and intercity V/STOL, and as such link the development of these two systems.
