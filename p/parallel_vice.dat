We designed a type of assistant positioning device for <b>parallel</b> machine <b>vice</b> to ensure complete positioning of work piece. The device can be easily and conveniently installed on the guide rail of a <b>parallel</b> machine <b>vice,</b> which keeps the generality of the machine vice and improves its performance. It features new structural design, easy to be processed, easy for use and optimized working efficiency and can be classified as a type of assistant positioning device of machine fixture with integral advantages economical efficiency and practicability...|$|R
40|$|The optimal design {{problem for}} {{networks}} with 3 -state components is the following: select from a given class of networks with n components, {{each of which}} can be operative or experience an open-mode or a shorted-mode failure state, the network with maximum reliability. We present an algorithm for solving this problem in the case of 2 -stage seriesparallel networks, i. e., networks consisting of a number of series configurations linked in <b>parallel</b> or <b>vice</b> versa. For practically relevant network sizes (up to 100 components), the algorithm is fast...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{physically}} parallel bars do not feel <b>parallel</b> and <b>vice</b> versa. The most plausible cause of this deviation is the biasing influence of an egocentric reference frame. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the strength of this egocentric contribution. The deviations from veridicality were measured in six experiments where subjects were presented with either haptic or visual information about parallelity or their deviations. It was found that even direct error feedback (either haptically or visually) did not even nearly result in veridical performance. The improvements found were attributed to a shift in focus towards a more allocentric reference frame, possibly reflecting the same mechanisms as found in delay and noninformative vision studies. We conclude that the illusionary percept of haptic parallelity is rather robust and is indeed caused by a strong reliance on an egocentric reference frame...|$|R
40|$|Gamma is {{a minimal}} {{language}} based on conditional multiset rewriting. The virtues of this paradigm {{in terms of}} systematic program construction and design of programs for highly parallel machines have been demonstrated in previous papers. We introduce here sequential and parallel operators for combining Gamma programs and we study their properties. The main focus of the paper is to give conditions under which sequential composition can be transformed into <b>parallel</b> composition and <b>vice</b> versa. Such transformations are especially valuable for adapting Gamma programs for execution on a particular target architecture...|$|R
5000|$|The {{parallel}} transport for {{a connection}} thus supplies a way of, in some sense, moving the local geometry of a manifold along a curve: that is, of connecting the geometries of nearby points. There may be many notions of parallel transport available, but a specification of one [...] - [...] {{one way of}} connecting up the geometries of points on a curve [...] - [...] is tantamount to providing a connection. In fact, the usual notion of connection is the infinitesimal analog of <b>parallel</b> transport. Or, <b>vice</b> versa, <b>parallel</b> transport is the local realization of a connection.|$|R
50|$|Associated {{with the}} memory is a half-word {{insertion}} register of 42-bit capacity. Each bit is temporarily stored in a magnetic core of this register during a memory reference. Each of these register cores is associated {{with one of the}} 42 memory planes. To write into the memory, {{the first half of the}} word is placed in the insertion register and the address selector alerts the appropriate column and the proper row of the top section in each of the 42 planes. At the appropriate instant the information is transferred from each core of the insertion register to the selected core in the corresponding plane of the memory. 42 pulse times later, the second half word has been placed in the insertion register and the process is repeated in the lower section of the memory. Read-outs are accomplished in a reverse manner. The speed of the memory has been adjusted to the speed of the arithmetic portion of the Univac which permits the transfer into or out of the memory of 12 characters in 40 microseconds. Word pulses flow from or to the high speed bus and the insertion register via a mechanism which converts from serial to <b>parallel</b> and <b>vice</b> versa, in 42 bit modules.|$|R
50|$|An I/O {{interface}} {{is required}} whenever the I/O device {{is driven by}} the processor. Typically a CPU communicates with devices via a bus. The interface must have necessary logic to interpret the device address generated by the processor. Handshaking should be implemented by the interface using appropriate commands (like BUSY, READY, and WAIT), and the processor can communicate with an I/O device through the interface. If different data formats are being exchanged, the interface must be able to convert serial data to <b>parallel</b> form and <b>vice</b> versa. Because it would be a waste for a processor to be idle while it waits for data from an input device there must be provision for generating interrupts and the corresponding type numbers for further processing by the processor if required.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of different transformations on coordination performance we compared two experiments with identical visual setup. Participants saw two dots circling {{next to each other}} on a screen. The right dot was controlled by the participants' movement and had to be coordinated with the left dot (target stimulus). Participants' movements were dissociated from their effects on the screen by means of transformed feedback. When the transformation was a phase shift (experiment 1) the results show that unimanual coordination occurs in reference to perceptual rather than motor space. When the transformation turned a symmetric movement into a <b>parallel</b> movement and <b>vice</b> versa (experiment 2) the results show neither an advantage for effect-based nor motor-related coordination in the transformed condition. Together, the results indicate that movements are coordinated with the environment in terms of their external effects. However, this coordination mode may break down with certain transformations...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic Refrigeration (MR) {{is a novel}} {{refrigeration}} technique {{based on}} eco-friendly solid materials as refrigerants, whom react to the application of magnetic fields, with warming and cooling by magnetocaloric effect. The thermodynamical cycle which best suits the magnetic refrigeration is Active Magnetic Regenerator cycle (AMR). Regenerator {{is the core of}} a magnetic refrigerator, since that it plays a dual-role: it operates both as refrigerant and regenerator in an AMR cycle. An AMR cycle consists of two adiabatic stages and two isofield stage. In this paper an investigation is conducted about the magnetocaloric refrigerator design through two-dimensional multiphysics numerical models of two different magnetocaloric regenerators: (1) a packed bed and (2) a parallel plates magnetic regenerators made of gadolinium, operating at room temperature under a 1. 5 T magnetic field induction. Both models employ water as secondary fluid. The tests were performed with variable fluid flow rate at fixed AMR cycle frequency. The results obtained are presented in terms of temperature span, cooling power, coefficient of performance and mechanical power of the circulation pump, and they indicate under which operating conditions packed bed configuration is to be preferred to <b>parallel</b> plates and <b>vice</b> versa...|$|R
40|$|Clinical single photon {{emission}} computed tomography (SPECT) equipped with pinhole collimators have a magnification factor {{that results in}} high spatial resolution images for small animal imaging. Using Monte Carlo simulations to model the acquisition process and the propagation of the photons {{from their point of}} emission to their detection point then integrating the model into an iterative reconstruction algorithm improves the signal-to-noise ratio, the contrast and the spatial resolution in the reconstructed images. However, pinhole SPECT systems are known to be very sensitive to geometrical misalignments. Geometrical misalignments are defined as the radial or axial shift of the collimator pinhole and/or twist and tilt of the detector heads and are introduced in the system each time the collimation device is changed (pinhole to <b>parallel</b> holes or <b>vice</b> versa). In this work, we present a flexible detector response function table (DRFT) design that takes into account the geometrical misalignments and avoids performing new Monte Carlo simulations for each exam in order to calculate a geometrical study-dependent system matrix. The utilization of the DRFT for the calculation of the system matrix speeds up its computation time by two orders of magnitude making it acceptable for preclinical and clinical applications...|$|R
50|$|One SST VCE {{concept is}} the Tandem Fan engine. The engine has two fans, both {{mounted on the}} {{low-pressure}} shaft, with a significant axial gap between the units. In normal flight, the engine is in the series mode, with the flow leaving the front fan passing directly into the second fan, the engine behaving much like a normal turbofan. However, for take-off, climb-out, final-descent and approach, the front fan is allowed to discharge directly through an auxiliary nozzle {{on the underside of}} the powerplant nacelle. Auxiliary intakes are opened on each side of the powerplant, allowing air to enter the rear fan and progress through the rest of the engine. Operating the fans in this parallel mode substantially increases the total airflow of the engine at a thrust, resulting in a lower jet velocity and a quieter engine. Back in the 1970s, Boeing modified a Pratt & Whitney JT8D to a Tandem Fan configuration and successfully demonstrated the switch from series to <b>parallel</b> operation (and <b>vice</b> versa) with the engine running, albeit at part power. In the Mid Tandem Fan concept, a high specific flow single stage fan is located between the high pressure (HP) and low pressure (LP) compressors of a turbojet core. Only bypass air is allowed to pass through the fan, the LP compressor exit flow passing through special passages within the fan disc, directly underneath the fan rotor blades. Some of the bypass air enters the engine via an auxiliary intake. During take-off and approach the engine behaves much like a normal civil turbofan, with an acceptable jet noise level (i.e., low specific thrust). However, for supersonic cruise, the fan variable inlet guide vanes and auxiliary intake close-off to minimize bypass flow and increase specific thrust. In this mode the engine acts more like a 'leaky' turbojet (e.g. the F404).|$|R
