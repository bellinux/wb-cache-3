The combined effects of the pitch-chord ratio, aspect ratio, and blade fillet with a slot configuration on the blade, have also been studied.

Various aspect ratios, together with the slot configuration, have been investigated and all of them have a positive effect on the cascade performance. For the blade with the blade fillet, the slot still has a positive effect on the control of the corner separation, while cascade performance with just a slot configuration is better than the slot configuration under the influence of the blade fillet...|$|R

We explore two optimization techniques that reduce the space requirements and the computational cost of SISJ and we compare it, analytically and experimentally, with other spatial join methods for two cases: 1) when the nonindexed input is read from disk and 2) when it is an intermediate result of a preceding database operator in a complex query plan. The importance of buffer splitting between consecutive join operators is also demonstrated through a two-join case study and a method that estimates the optimal splitting is proposed. Our evaluation shows that SISJ outperforms alternative methods in most cases and is suitable for limited memory conditions. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
