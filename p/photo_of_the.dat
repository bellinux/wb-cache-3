5|$|At {{the same}} time, MacArthur had {{attacked}} the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous {{picture of his}} first meeting with the Emperor, whose impact on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw the Emperor as a mere man overshadowed by the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, the Emperor had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were always taken from a certain angle to make him look taller and more impressive than he really was. No Japanese photographer would have taken such a <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emperor being overshadowed by MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned the <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emperor with MacArthur {{on the grounds that it}} damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it. The photo was intended as a message to the Emperor about who was going to be the senior partner in their relationship.|$|E

While driving through the forest, their truck hits caltrops left in the ground by eco-terrorists, forcing them to walk {{the rest of the}} way. Upon arriving at the camp site, Mulder and Scully find the cabins abandoned and the communication equipment destroyed. Searching the forest, they find a corpse encased in a large cocoon hanging from a tree.|$|E
5|$|Lyrically {{the songs}} {{reflected}} the band members' experiences {{growing up in}} Belleville. Farrar and Tweedy romanticized tales about unemployment, alcoholism, and the feeling {{of living in a}} small town in an effort to emulate the profundity of songwriters such as Woody Guthrie. Musically, No Depression was influenced by the start-stop musical pattern of the Minutemen. The cover of the album features a blurry <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band, taken by J. Hamilton, reminiscent of the albums released on Folkways Records.|$|E

5|$|The album's artwork {{was created}} by Kamikene and Daisuke Ishizaka of Hatos. It {{features}} two overlapping circles colored deep blue and bright blue, {{in order to create}} , a color close to indigo. The bright blue was chosen as it was a synthetic ink that regularly occurs in Japanese printing, while the deep blue was taken naturally, isolating a color taken from a <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky just before dawn. The center of the artwork features the Kikuuiki typography, as well as a logo of two overlapping circles. The mix of natural and artificial blue circles was used to represent Kikuuikis theme of mixing points.|$|E

Doggett and Reyes turn to The Lone Gunmen when Fletcher provides an alleged <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> super soldier, whom The Lone Gunmen recognize as Yves Adele Harlow (Zuleikha Robinson), a fellow hacker who went missing a year ago. The Gunmen refuse to believe the evidence, especially when they find that Fletcher provided it, although the agents continue to pursue the trail.|$|E

5|$|While the {{identity}} of the video creator remained unknown, the location at which it was filmed has been identified. A Polish Internet user who was following the story went to the former Zofiówka Sanatorium, near Otwock, a short distance south of Warsaw. One of the rooms there had the same fenestration and graffiti seen in the video. The latter were not present in a <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room taken in November 2013, suggesting the video was made between then and April 2015.|$|E
5|$|Although OR-7 was {{the first}} gray wolf to visit California in nearly 100 years, other wolves have since {{migrated}} to Siskiyou County, {{just south of the}} Oregon–California border. In 2015, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) released a <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shasta Pack, consisting of two adults and five pups. The breeding pair came from the same pack as OR-7, making them his siblings. In 2017, the CDFW and the U.S. Forest Service determined that at least three wolf pups from a second pack, the Lassen Pack, can be traced to OR-7. One of OR-7s male offspring mated with another wolf to produce the pups, the birth of which made Journey a grandfather. The Lassen Pack, which lives in Lassen National Forest, is California's second pack since wolves were eradicated from the state in the 1920s. In June 2017, CDFW biologists fitted the female of the Lassen Pack breeding pair with a tracking collar.|$|E
5|$|An {{image of}} one of Onyx's early prototypes {{surfaced}} online, with a similar hardware to the 9000's, including the same trackball. That prototype was early reviewed by website CrackBerry, which confirmed diverse details about the device, such as the 480×360 display, the 3.2 megapixels camera and connectivity features—Wi-Fi and GPS. The same day, other information regarding technicalities were revealed on a surfaced AT filesheet about the smartphone. Already known as the BlackBerry 9020 and having started production, a <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> device surfaced, though it replaced the trackball with a trackpad. A previous prototype with a trackball was put up for sale on eBay, where it passed the mark of $600; four days later, a pre-launch list of then-upcoming smartphones for AT surfaced online on August 9, 2009, which listed the device. A T-Mobile press image was leaked on September 8.|$|E
