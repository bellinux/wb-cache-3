25|$|The Presidency of the Council of the European Union is {{responsible}} for the functioning of the Council of the European Union, the upper house of the EU legislature. It rotates among the member states of the EU every six months. The presidency is not an individual, but rather the position is held by a national government. It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the President of the European Union. The <b>presidency's</b> <b>function</b> is to chair meetings of the Council, determine its agendas, set a work programme and facilitate dialogue both at Council meetings and with other EU institutions. The presidency is currently (as of July 2017) held by Estonia.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Presidency</b> Council <b>functioned</b> in {{the role}} of the President of Iraq until one {{successive}} term after the Constitution was ratified and a government was seated. The Presidency council consisted of one President and two deputies, or Vice-Presidents, and the Presidency Council must have made all decisions unanimously.|$|R

40|$|This paper takes {{stock of}} the growing body of {{research}} on the European Union (EU) Presidency, a vital player in EU negotiations. The paper also suggests new avenues of research, among which we prioritize one issue cluster: we ask under what conditions and in what way (following which social logic) norms guide Presidency behaviour? Our focus is directed towards the impartiality norm as that norm most strongly influences whether, and to what extent, Presidencies act as a ‘broker’, one of the <b>Presidency</b> <b>functions</b> that has received most attention in the literature. We also suggest a number of pointers concerning methodology and operationalization of the above question for empirical research. We conclude with some brief thoughts on the implications of our proposed approach to Presidency norms for bridge-building between rationalist and sociological accounts...|$|R

Later {{he served as a}} vice-minister of the <b>Presidency,</b> with <b>functions</b> as adviser of the head of state, and directed the plan of governmental action in accordance with the peace accords of January 1992 that ended fighting with the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) guerilla group.|$|R
5000|$|World Conference is {{the highest}} {{legislative}} body in the Community of Christ and is empowered to act for the entire church. It operates according to a principle known as [...] "common consent" [...] and is presided over by the First <b>Presidency.</b> The <b>functioning</b> of the councils, quorums and orders of the church are also considered {{an important part of}} the World Conference.|$|R
5000|$|The Presidency Council was {{an entity}} that {{operated}} {{under the auspices}} of the [...] "transitional provisions" [...] of the Constitution. According to the Constitution, the <b>Presidency</b> Council <b>functioned</b> in the role of the President until one successive term after the Constitution was ratified and a government was seated. The Presidency Council had the additional power to send legislation back to the Council of Representatives for revision.|$|R
40|$|Using a role theory framework, {{this thesis}} seeks better to {{understand}} how the Council <b>Presidency</b> <b>functions</b> as a policy actor, specifically within the sphere of Crisis Management policy-making as enshrined in the ESDP before the Lisbon Treaty. It focuses on explaining Presidency role variation and on identifying the main factors (at policy level, Presidency level, the level of contingent factors, and at actor/Member State level) responsible for such variation within Crisis Management policy. For these purposes, the thesis draws on the 2007 Portuguese Presidency as a case-study which illustrates how these factors and both self and alter expectations about Presidency behaviour are closely related to actual performance. The main conclusion of the thesis is that role theory allows different theoretical contributions to be combined into a single and more comprehensive explanatory framework. By shedding light on the apparently contradictory actions of different Presidencies, thus, this thesis' role theory framework opens the door not only to a sharper conception both of Crisis Management policy and the Presidency itself, but also {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanisms underlying the behaviour of other policy actors and the evolution of different European policy areas.

50|$|Until 1980 most {{of powers}} of the Presidency (and control over the country in general) were in fact {{exercised}} by Josip Broz Tito, who {{was president of the}} republic for life. After his death in May 1980, his office stayed vacant and the <b>Presidency</b> began to <b>function</b> according to the constitution.|$|R
40|$|The present article explores {{whether the}} first Trio Presidency of the Council of Ministers of the European Union (EU), {{composed}} of Germany, Portugal and Slovenia, {{lived up to}} the goal of ensuring greater continuity and sustainability in managing the Council’s work. Focusing on the Trio’s performance in promoting the principle of Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) in EU global action, the article explores patterns of cooperation established by the first Trio alongside the traditional roles of the rotating presidency, as the manager, provider of political initiative, broker, and representative of the Council and member states. The contribution demonstrates the emergence of a distinctive cooperation pattern among Germany, Portugal, and Slovenia, which we refer to as ‘Trio effects’. While such effects were established in all <b>presidency</b> <b>functions</b> with the exception of EU external representation, the Trio effects in exerting management functions contributed most in having more continuity in the promotion of the PCD. Taking into account the particular institutional and procedural context in which the Trio operated, the contribution draws lessons for the role of the Trio in the post-Lisbon external action system. Along with the review of official policy documents and secondary sources, this contribution draws on 40 anonymous semi-structured expert interviews, which were conducted by both authors between 2007 and 2009 in Brussels, Berlin, Lisbon and Ljubljana...|$|R
50|$|Smith {{died in a}} car {{accident}} on June 14, 1958 while driving north along U.S. Highway 69 from Independence, Missouri to Lamoni, Iowa. After his death, the First <b>Presidency</b> continued to <b>function,</b> composed of the two counselors W. Wallace Smith and F. Henry Edwards until a World Conference of the church confirmed W. Wallace Smith as his brother's successor later that fall.|$|R
40|$|How do small EU {{member states}} {{approach}} the Council Presidency: is the Presidency a silencer or an amplifier of national interests? Moreover, what {{challenges and opportunities}} do a small state face in the Presidency? In this comparative case study, I analysed the approach, challenges and opportunities of three member states {{in relation to the}} chairmanship: Denmark, an old and experienced member state and its Presidency in 2012; Latvia, a relatively new member state and first time Presidency in 2015; and finally Estonia, another new member, and its upcoming first time Presidency in 2018. My main findings indicate that the <b>Presidency</b> <b>functions</b> as a silencer for first time holders of the Presidency; and as an amplifier for Denmark, which efficiently used cognitive power resources to tilt the Presidency agenda in its favour, while remaining an honest broker. The Presidency offers many opportunities, among which the most important is the transformation of the public administration. Moreover, to showcase the EU to the incumbent state, and vice versa, is important for the integration process. It is also essential for the identity formation of small states to prove their capacity within the union. Finally, I established that a close relationship with the Commission is an important leadership quality and power resource for small states. For small states, the Presidency represents a challenge for the public administration, while unforeseeable events can entirely change the course of the Presidency. Furthermore, the domestic as well as the European political landscape can negatively influence the decision-making...|$|R

In the same move, he also became acting {{head of state}} (Coordinator of the Presidency) of Yugoslavia, as Milošević initially {{refused to accept the}} President-designate Stipe Mesić, representing Croatia, and unilaterally declared the <b>presidency</b> incapable of <b>functioning.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Revised Standard Reference Guide to Indian Paper Money’’ {{includes}} {{high resolution}} colour images of notes from Semi-Government and <b>Presidency</b> Banks, which <b>functioned</b> until 1861. The Government of India (British Raj) then undertook {{the issue of}} banknotes in 1861, {{and that is when}} all Early, Private, and Presidency Banks’ currency issues ceased. The Government of India issued banknotes in 1861 which were uniface with a portrait of Queen Victoria, and underprinting was introduced to the portrait in the series beginning 1867.|$|R
5000|$|Individual apostles may be {{assigned}} to various responsibilities of church leadership, including field administration. Together with the First Presidency and the Presiding Bishopric, this council {{is a part of}} the [...] "World Church Leadership Council." [...] Each of the apostles is called to serve as a [...] "special witness of the gospel", and each is appointed by the First Presidency to oversee one or more of the church's mission fields. In recent years, some members of the Council are also given responsibility for certain areas of program ministry. If for any reason the First Presidency is dissolved or otherwise unable to preside over the World Conference, the Council of Twelve Apostles presides over the conference until such time as the First <b>Presidency</b> resumes <b>functioning</b> or is reorganized. Assigned by the First Presidency, they carry major responsibility for church expansion, and serve as administrative supervisors of field jurisdictions. The Council of Twelve Apostles elects one of its members to serve as President of the Council of Twelve and another member to serve as Secretary of the Council of Twelve. Members of the Council of Twelve Apostles are normally full-time paid ministers, called [...] "Appointee Ministers" [...] in the Community of Christ.|$|R
40|$|The Lisbon Treaty {{has made}} {{significant}} changes to the institutional functioning of the whole system of the European Union. Most notably, it has constituted a non-rotating long-term Presidency for the European Council and Foreign Affairs Council. Before the Lisbon Treaty, the Member State of the European Union presided over all Council constellations, including the European Council, for a six-month term. These changes certainly contributed to the solution of some issues (for instance continuity issues), {{on the other hand}} these changes affected in some ways the performance of the rotating Presidency. I focus on these changes to the institutional form of the Presidency and on the effects these changes had on the Presidency's performance in its functions, namely the negotiation and external representation. I draw on the experience of the first two post-Lisbon Presidencies, Spanish and Belgian one. My aim is to examine the changing role of the <b>Presidency</b> in these <b>functions.</b> I explore the role of the Presidency before and during negotiations of the founding Treaties of the European Union and its role after the reforms introduced by the Lisbon Treaty. Mainly, I focus on examining the relationship between the rotating Presidency and newly-established permanent Presidency of the European Council and High [...] ...|$|R
