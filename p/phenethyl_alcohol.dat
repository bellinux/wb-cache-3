40|$|Wild-type {{strains of}} Escherichia coli K- 12 are {{resistant}} to acriflavine. Gene acrA+ which determines resistance to acriflavine is located near the lac region of the chromosome. This gene determines not only resistance to basic dyes but also resistance to <b>phenethyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Acriflavine resistance was transmitted, together with <b>phenethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> resistance, from a resistant Hfr strain to a sensitive recipient by mating.

A suppressor mutation, sup- 100, closely linked to the acr locus, suppresses the acrA 1 gene (phenotypically acriflavine-resistant), but does not determine resistance to <b>phenethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and basic dyes other than acriflavine. The genetic change in the locus acrA 1 to types resistant to basic dyes and <b>phenethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> was accompanied by an increase in resistance to sodium dodecyl sulfate, a potent solvent of lipopolysaccharide and lipoprotein.
