50|$|Spilocaea oleaginea is a deuteromycete fungal plant pathogen, {{the cause}} of the disease olive <b>peacock</b> <b>spot,</b> also known as olive leaf spot and bird's eye spot. This plant disease {{commonly}} affects the leaves of olive trees worldwide. The disease affects trees throughout the growing season and can cause significant losses in yield. The disease causes blemishes on the fruit, delays ripening, and reduces the yield of oil. Defoliation and in severe cases, twig death, can occur, and the disease can have long-term health effects on the trees.|$|E
50|$|Spilocaea oleagina is a Deuteromycete {{because it}} has no known sexual stage. If the sexual stage exists and is discovered, it will belong to the genus Venturia.The {{mycelium}} typically develops on the leaf tissue. Lesions {{can be seen on}} the upper surface of leaves.The reproductive spores of Olive <b>Peacock</b> <b>Spot</b> that are known to exist are conidia. The disease is spread in several ways. The conidia can be spread by insects and the wind, and locally through rain water. The insect suspected of spreading Olive <b>Peacock</b> <b>Spot</b> is Ectopsocus briggsi, which is in the same order as lice.Olive trees keep their leaves year round. The primary infection occurs in the fall.The mycelia in leaf lesions infect the surrounding tissue and produce conidia for the primary infection. Sporulation from the leaf lesions spreads the conidia to healthy plant tissue. Young leaves are more susceptible to infection than older leaves. Sporulation continues during the winter and into the spring. The pathogen goes dormant during the hot, dry summer and survives as mycelium. The mycelia go dormant inside lesions on living leaves. Leaves that have dropped to the ground have also been known to produce infection from lesions, but this is not usually a significant source of infection.|$|E

Commodore Biddle also received new orders of conduct, {{he was now}} able to land shore parties in populated areas {{as long as he}} informed the locals first. Biddle was also ordered to cooperate with any other sovereign naval forces operating against pirates. HMS Grecian of six guns captured the eight gun schooner La Cata on March 1, 1823 south of Cuba. Thirty brigands were killed in action and only three were taken prisoner out of a force of over 100 men. USS Fox was sent to San Juan, Puerto Rico, in March 1823 to obtain a list of all legally commissioned privateers and a details of their instructions. When the American schooner entered San Juan Harbor on March 3, an artillery battery fired on the ship. A few shots hit the Fox which mortally wounded her commander, Lieutenant William H. Cocke. Commodore Porter later accepted an apology for the incident from Puerto Rico's governor. The British warships Tyne and HMS Thracian of eighteen guns defeated the notorious pirate Captain Cayatano Aragonez's thirteen gun ship Zaragozana on March 31, in a running battle, the two British ships chased Captain Aragonez into Mata Harbor where boats were lowered and captured the vessel. Ten pirates were killed and twenty eight were captured while the Royal Navy sustained only slight casualties. Two barges, USS Gallinipper and USS Mosquito, liberated an American merchant vessel on April 8. The navy sailors killed two of the pirates and arrested one other though most got away. On April 16, Mosquito, Gallinipper and USS <b>Peacock,</b> <b>spotted</b> a felucca off Colorados. Peacock managed to capture the felucca though its crew fled to shore but before leaving the pirates scuttled three of their schooners.|$|R

50|$|Olive <b>peacock</b> <b>spot</b> {{disease is}} a {{worldwide}} agricultural problem and it thrives in similar conditions wherever it occurs. It depends on mild to low temperatures and free moisture to germinate and so it usually infects in the fall, winter, and spring. Hot and dry conditions in the summer cause the fungus to become inactivated and the leaf spots to turn white and crusted. During the summer, the diseased leaves fall leaving only the healthy ones on the partially defoliated trees. This provides a natural control for the disease. The disease also mainly infects young leaves in the spring.|$|E
50|$|Current {{practices}} of managing olive <b>peacock</b> <b>spot</b> disease aim to have consistent suppression {{by keeping the}} levels of inoculum low and through preventative measures. This is {{because there is no}} way to treat this disease once it appears in the spring or while the trees have fruit. The most common management approach is to spray the foliage with a copper compound after the fruit has been harvested in the fall and again in the late winter if the environment is extremely wet. A power sprayer with high pressure is the most effective as it helps coat the entire surface of each leaf, even in the interior of the tree. If copper is sprayed onto the fruit it is nearly impossible to wash away, and so late harvests are often lost to infection. The spray comes in various forms of copper hydroxide, copper oxychloride, tribasic copper sulfate, and copper oxide. A few of these have been legally classified as organic.|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the relative susceptibility of new cultivars to the main diseases of a crop is a key point to consider prior to their release to the nursery industry. This study provides a rigorous characterization of the resistance of 15 new olive cultivars and their genitors (‘Arbequina,’ ‘Frantoio,’ and ‘Picual’) to the three main aerial diseases, <b>peacock</b> <b>spot,</b> anthracnose, and cercosporiosis caused by Spilocaea oleagina, Colletotrichum acutatum, and Pseudocercospora cladosporioides, respectively. To do so, developing leaves and detached green-yellowish fruit were inoculated in laboratory tests with S. oleagina and C. acutatum, respectively, using conidial suspensions of both pathogens. Additionally, a previously validated rating scale {{was used to assess}} the incidence of leaves with symptoms of S. oleagina or P. cladosporioides and the fruit rot incidence of C. acutatum in the trees for four years under field conditions. As a result, only two of the cultivars were susceptible to <b>peacock</b> <b>spot,</b> most likely because these new cultivars were previously screened for resistance to the disease on previous phases of the breeding program. Conversely, the 15 cultivars were susceptible or moderately susceptible to cercosporiosis. Five of the 15 new cultivars were classified as resistant to anthracnose, with four of them descendants of ‘Frantoio’ × ‘Picual’ crosses. In addition, the cultivars resistance to C. acutatum showed a negative linear correlation with the total phenols content of olive oil. This information regarding disease reaction of the new olive cultivars is essential for nursery industry and growers.

40|$|Although much {{is known}} about the effect of climatic {{conditions}} on the development of <b>peacock</b> leaf <b>spot</b> of olive, field-operational models predicting disease outbreaks are lacking. With the aim of developing such models, a 10 -year survey was conducted to relate leaf infection to climate parameters that can be easily monitored in the field. As outbreaks of disease are known to be linked to rain, models were evaluated for their ability to predict whether infection would occur following a rain event, depending on air temperature and duration of relative humidity above 85 %. A total of 134 rain events followed by confirmed leaf infection and 191 rain events not followed by detectable infection were examined. The field data were adequately fitted (both specificity and sensitivity > 0 Æ 97) with either a multilayer neural network or with two of six tested regression models describing high boundary values of high humidity duration, above which no infection occurred over the temperature range, and low boundary values below which no infection occurred. The data also allowed the selection of a model successfully relating the duration of latent period (time between infection and the first detection of leaf spots) as a function of air temperature after the beginning of rain (R 2 > 0 Æ 98). The predictive abilities of these models were confirmed during 2 years of testing in commercial olive orchards in southern France. They should thus provide useful forecasting tools for the rational application of treatments and foster a reduction in fungicide use against this major disease of olive...|$|R
5000|$|Bishmizzine {{rests in}} the middle of the Koura plain, {{probably}} one of the largest uninterrupted olive groves in the world. It is bordered by hills and thus winter rain flows in water ways down to the town. The village rests on a large aquifer and this underground water body partially explains the extremes in climate when compared to neighbouring villages. For example, thin ice develops overnight in winter while it does not in neighbouring villages. At night the temperature may differ by 5 to 7 degrees C lower than the nearby adjacent surrounding hills or neighboring villages. Another factor that may play a role in explaining this climate conundrum is the fact that Bishmizzine {{rests in the}} plain at the base of the Western Lebanese Range of mountains and is surrounded by hills which act to trap any cold air that may flow by convection down the range from as high up as the Cedars of Lebanon in Bcharre. Hence there was a climatology station for the government in the village that utilized the temperature of the plain at 4 to 5 am before sunrise in an equation to arbitrarily calculate the temperature at the top of the mountain range. In the old days this environmental phenomena was counteracted by a pine forest that used to blockade the cold night air advancing down the mountain slopes towards the town. Remnants of this pine forest remain to this day and act as a picnic zone visited by many. The argylls soil in Bishmizzine has been sought after by cement factories that find its characteristics favorable for quality cement production. This has been a blessing and a curse at the same time. The blessing is obviously financial for the land owner and jobs created in the nearby cement factories however the environmental impact has been catastrophic. Huge deep excavation areas emptied of soil remained after the removal of the soil. These areas then filled up with rain water during the winter and resulted in a swamp/wetland like environment with rising humidity. The damp environment as well as soil erosion have rendered the surrounding area susceptible to fungal diseases ex olive leaf <b>spot</b> or <b>peacock</b> eye <b>spot</b> Spilocea oleaginea [...] which infested initially the area around the excavations and then spread to involve the surrounding olive fields rendering the once productive olive groves unproductive. This disease now infests olives in an area up to 4 km away from the epicenter. Noteworthy is the recent natural transformation of these excavation sites from a swamp to a wetland habitat with flora and fauna uncharacteristic of Lebanon. This transformation has recently stopped soil erosion and stabilized the habitat. Also this phenomenon has become a source of inquiry for botanists curious as to where some of the atypical flora came from ex. reeds characteristic of the Nile or Danube. Since Bishmizzine lies on the route of migratory birds some experts have postulated that the water holes became a rest area for migrating birds ex storks and hence the seeds were carried in their feathers from distant areas. The disease burden of fungal olive disease peacock eye remains high however and a concerted effort by farmers, government and NGOs is needed. A large area of Bishmizzine remains free of fungal disease and produces some of the best extra virgin olive oil and table olives in the area.|$|R
