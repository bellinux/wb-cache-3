5|$|Evans {{had first}} begun to {{consider}} the potential applications of steam power for transportation while still an apprentice in the 1780s, and had developed rudimentary designs for 'steam carriages' in the 1790s. In 1801, Evans definitively began work on making his long-held dream of a steam carriage into reality. Early steam engineers, most notably Watt contemporary William Murdoch, had developed plans for a steam-propelled carriage incorporating a heavy flywheel, in which pressure was converted directly to rotary power, however it became apparent in experimentation that a low-pressure, rotary steam engine would never be powerful enough to propel a carriage of any weight forward. Evans's attention thus turned to a reciprocating engine, not only for his steam carriage ideas, but also for industrial application. Importantly, Evans became an early proponent of 'strong steam' or high-pressure engines, an idea long resisted by Watt and earlier steam pioneers because the necessary iron making and metal working technology was lacking. Evans recognized that a high-pressure steam engine would be essential {{to the development of}} a steam carriage because they could be built far smaller while providing similar or greater <b>power</b> <b>outputs</b> to low-pressure equivalents. Some experiments with high-pressure steam engines had been made in Europe, most notably an unsuccessful steam tractor developed by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot. However the prevailing fear of early steam engineering was that no boiler could safely contain high-pressure steam. Evans ignored potential drawbacks, and developed radically different designs which called for engines operating at high-pressure and the elimination of the condenser—a central component of conventional designs. His designs also incorporated a grasshopper beam, a double-acting cylinder, and four steam valves. Each valve was independently operated by one of four cams. The resulting design was a high-pressure steam engine that had a higher power-to-weight ratio that prevailing designs, making locomotives and steamboats practical. It was also mechanically simpler than condensing engines, making it less costly to build and maintain, and did not require large volumes of condensing water. These features would make it similarly suited for a variety of industrial applications.|$|E

25|$|The {{pyroelectric effect}} {{converts}} a temperature change into electric current or voltage. It {{is analogous to}} the piezoelectric effect, which is another type of ferroelectric behavior. Pyroelectricity requires time-varying inputs and suffers from small <b>power</b> <b>outputs</b> in energy harvesting applications due to its low operating frequencies. However, one key advantage of pyroelectrics over thermoelectrics is that many pyroelectric materials are stable up to 1200 ⁰C or higher, enabling energy harvesting from high temperature sources and thus increasing thermodynamic efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Unlike some {{cars and}} motorcycles, a Wankel aero-engine will be {{sufficiently}} warm before full power is asked {{of it because}} of the time taken for pre-flight checks. A Wankel aero-engine spends most of its operational time at high <b>power</b> <b>outputs,</b> with little idling. This makes ideal the use of peripheral ports. An advantage is that modular engines with more than two rotors are feasible. If icing of any intake tracts is an issue, there is plenty of waste engine heat available to prevent icing.|$|E
25|$|The BSh-2 was {{overweight}} and underpowered, {{with the original}} Mikulin AM-35 1,022kW (1,370hp) engine designed to give its greatest <b>power</b> <b>outputs</b> at high altitude. Because of this it was redesigned as the TsKB-57, a lighter single-seat design, with the more powerful 1,254kW (1,680hp) Mikulin AM-38 engine, a development of the AM-35 optimised for low level operation. The TsKB-57 first flew on 12 October 1940. The production aircraft passed State Acceptance Trials in March 1941, and was redesignated Il-2 in April. Deliveries to operational units commenced in May 1941.|$|E

Aerodynamic <b>power</b> <b>output,</b> calculated from momentum and blade-element aerodynamic theories, scales with the 1 - 08 power of body mass, amounting to about 40 % {{of the mechanical}} <b>power</b> <b>output</b> of large moths to about 15 % in the smallest individuals. Calculated value for the inertial power cost of hovering represents a larger fraction of the mechanical <b>power</b> <b>output</b> than the aerodynamic cost in all moths, with the value increasing as body mass decreases. Independent estimates of inertial <b>power</b> <b>output</b> based on metabolic data {{are similar to those}} obtained from calculations of the moment of inertia for the wings. These data suggest that inertial <b>power</b> <b>output</b> represents the largest power requirement for hovering sphinx moths, and that elastic torques do not significantly reduce the mechanical <b>power</b> <b>output.</b> Higher mass-specific <b>power</b> input of small sphinx moths appears {{to be the result of}} greater mass-specific inertial power requirements.

25|$|Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can be {{manufactured}} to emit radiation in the ultraviolet range. LED efficiency at 365nm is about 5–8%, whereas efficiency at 395nm {{is closer to}} 20%, and <b>power</b> <b>outputs</b> at these longer UV wavelengths are also better. Such LED arrays are beginning {{to be used for}} UV curing applications, and are already successful in digital print applications and inert UV curing environments. Power densities approaching 3W/cm2 (30kW/m2) are now possible, and this, coupled with recent developments by photoinitiator and resin formulators, makes the expansion of LED-cured UV materials likely.|$|E
25|$|The surface-to-volume-ratio in {{the moving}} {{combustion}} chamber is so complex that a direct comparison cannot {{be made between}} a reciprocating piston engine and a Wankel engine. The flow velocity and the heat losses are quite different. Surface temperature characteristics are completely different; the film {{of oil in the}} Wankel engine acts as insulation. Engines with a higher compression ratio have a worse surface-to-volume ratio. The surface-to-volume ratio of a reciprocating piston diesel engine is much poorer than a reciprocating piston gasoline engine, but diesel engines have a higher efficiency factor. Hence, comparing <b>power</b> <b>outputs</b> is a realistic metric. A reciprocating piston engine with equal power to a Wankel will be approximately twice the displacement. When comparing the power-to-weight ratio, physical size or physical weight to a similar power output piston engine, the Wankel is superior.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{few years}} of the {{introduction}} of the A2 class 4-6-0 in 1907, it was clear that increasingly heavy train loads would require a more powerful locomotive on principal main lines. From as early as 1918, a series of drawings for potential 4-6-2 'Pacific' type locomotives began to emerge from the VR's Locomotive Design Section, some of which were ultimately developed into the 3 cylinder S class heavy Pacific of 1928. However, plans for a smaller 2 cylinder Pacific, with an axle load below 20 tons to allow operation across the VR mainline network, were put on hold during the 1930s. This was partly due to the decline in traffic and revenue due to the Great Depression, and partly due to the improved <b>power</b> <b>outputs</b> and efficiency from the A2 locomotives after the application of a series of smokebox design and draughting changes referred to as 'Modified Front End' in the mid-1930s.|$|E
40|$|Some {{evidence}} exists that {{the determination of}} maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) with lactate minimum (LM) in highly trained athletes is not as accurate as in less trained athletes. Therefore, we compared <b>power</b> <b>output</b> at LM with <b>power</b> <b>output</b> MLSS in moderately up to highly trained subjects. 63 subjects performed a test on a cycle ergometer to determine <b>power</b> <b>output</b> at LM and 3 or more constant-load tests of 30 minutes to determine <b>power</b> <b>output</b> at MLSS. Mean <b>power</b> <b>output</b> at LM (245 ± 29 W; mean ± SD) was slightly lower than <b>power</b> <b>output</b> at MLSS (255 ± 32 W). The correlation between <b>power</b> <b>output</b> at MLSS and LM was high, and the regression line runs parallel {{to the line of}} identity showing that the results of highly trained subjects agree with the results of less trained subjects (LM and MLSS r = 0. 867, p < 0. 001). The modified blood-lactate kinetic in highly trained athletes compared with less trained persons does not impair accuracy at LM. Therefore, we suggest LM as a valid and meaningful concept to estimate <b>power</b> <b>output</b> at MLSS in 1 single test in moderately up to highly trained athletes...|$|R

25|$|Even {{after the}} war, {{upgrades}} {{on the line}} to Ararat necessary for H class operation were not made as the VR struggled with a backlog of maintenance work which had built up during the 1940s. When the VR finally embarked on major capital investment in the early 1950s, diesel and electric traction were under consideration. Although diesel locomotives of the early 1950s typically had far lower <b>power</b> <b>outputs</b> than the H class, they could be run in multiple-unit operation, with one crew controlling two or more locomotives. In August 1952, two new B class diesel-electric locomotives established their credentials during trials by hauling a 1,121 ton goods train up Ingliston Bank and covering in 44 minutes the same distance two A2 class locomotives took to haul a 690-ton load in 67 minutes. The B class locomotives proved their ability to provide the same (if not better) performance as the H class, but without the heavy axle load and requirements for upgraded infrastructure. They became the new motive power not only for The Overland, but also mainline goods service. The days of mainline steam locomotives were numbered.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to examine the role of central and peripheral fatigue on 4000 -m cycling time trial performance by comparing changes in <b>power</b> <b>output</b> and integrated electromyography (iEMG) in differently paced maximal efforts. Methods: Eight well-trained men performed three randomly ordered time trials with different pacing strategies, in which the first 2000 m were manipulated to evoke an increasing, even, and decreasing <b>power</b> <b>output</b> profile (SUB, EVEN, and SUPRA, respectively). Subjects were instructed to finish the last 2000 m of all trials in the shortest time possible. iEMG of the rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), and biceps femoris (BF) muscle, mechanical <b>power</b> <b>output,</b> and gas exchange variables were measured. Anaerobic and aerobic contributions to mechanical <b>power</b> <b>output</b> were calculated from gas exchange data. Results: The increase in mechanical <b>power</b> <b>output</b> during the SUB time trials was always associated with an increase in iEMG in all muscles. A decrease in mechanical <b>power</b> <b>output</b> {{near the end of the}} time trials was also marked by an increase in iEMG for all muscles, except for the RF. Comparing the last 2000 -m interval with the first, aerobic <b>power</b> <b>output</b> increased for all strategies. Anaerobic <b>power</b> <b>output</b> increased in SUB and decreased in EVEN and SUPRA. Conclusion: The relationship between iEMG and mechanical <b>power</b> <b>output</b> pattern was consistent with peripheral fatigue rather than central downregulation of mechanical <b>power</b> <b>output.</b> Specifically, anaerobic energy resources seem to be important in regulating pacing strategy.
