5|$|The {{scenario}} was {{a continuation}} of the narrative of <b>Path</b> <b>of</b> Radiance, even though that game was not given an intentional cliffhanger ending. So the story would be comprehensible for people who had not played <b>Path</b> <b>of</b> Radiance, the story was split up into four segments divided between the game's various factions. The team initially thought of a three-part structure, then settled on the current format. Their aim from the beginning was to create a large-scale, intricate world for players to enjoy. It {{was the first time the}} developers had incorporated such a structure into a Fire Emblem game. The dialogue for characters was made slightly rougher based on feedback from <b>Path</b> <b>of</b> Radiance, where character dialogue remained calm and cultured even in battle situations. The total number of characters increased by approximately 1.5 times compared to <b>Path</b> <b>of</b> Radiance. So players could keep track of how characters interacted with each other, the team introduced a character relationship flow chart. The game's Japanese subtitle made reference to both a key character and the way Telleus came to be. They also wanted to continue to portray the themes of conflict explored in <b>Path</b> <b>of</b> Radiance. The game's thematic color, expressed in its artwork and presentation, was red, as opposed to the use of blue in <b>Path</b> <b>of</b> Radiance. Senri Kita, the character designer for <b>Path</b> <b>of</b> Radiance, returned in that capacity for Radiant Dawn.|$|E

5|$|As with {{previous}} Fire Emblem games, <b>Path</b> <b>of</b> Radiance {{takes place in}} a continuity and setting separate {{from the rest of the}} series. The game's setting is the continent of Tellius, inhabited by two species: the humanoid Beorc, and the shape-shifting Laguz. According to legend, the goddess who made the world created Beorc in her image, and created the Laguz to fill the gap between herself and beasts. The two races have struggled to coexist, leading to racial tensions and conflict on both sides. By the events of <b>Path</b> <b>of</b> Radiance, Tellius is divided into seven nations which remain at peace. A key item in Tellius is Lehran's Medallion, the world's incarnation of the recurring Fire Emblem. It is a bronze medallion said to contain a dark deity who brought chaos to the world 800 years before and caused all the world but Tellius to be engulfed by the sea. To prevent the dark god being freed, war must be prevented in Tellius.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} game, the CGI cutscenes were created by Digital Frontier.

For the cutscenes, Digital Frontier were asked to show a more epic scope rather than just focusing on the characters, a trend from <b>Path</b> <b>of</b> Radiance the developers felt was wrong. All of the character movements in cutscenes were mapped using motion capture, with between 100 and 150 animations per character to implement.|$|E
