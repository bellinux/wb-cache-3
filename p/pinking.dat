40|$|Abstract Background <b>PINK</b> 1 is a {{mitochondria}}-targeted kinase that constitutively localizes to {{both the}} mitochondria and the cytosol. The mechanism of how <b>PINK</b> 1 achieves cytosolic localization following mitochondrial processing remains unknown. Understanding <b>PINK</b> 1 subcellular localization will give us insights into <b>PINK</b> 1 functions and how mutations in <b>PINK</b> 1 lead to Parkinson's disease. We asked how the mitochondrial localization signal, the transmembrane domain, and the kinase domain participate in <b>PINK</b> 1 localization. Results We confirmed that <b>PINK</b> 1 mitochondrial targeting signal is responsible for mitochondrial localization. Once inside the mitochondria, we found that both <b>PINK</b> 1 transmembrane and kinase domain are important for membrane tethering and cytosolic-facing topology. We also showed that <b>PINK</b> 1 dual subcellular distribution requires both Hsp 90 interaction with the kinase domain and the proteolysis at a cleavage site downstream of the transmembrane domain because removal of this cleavage site completely abolished cytosolic <b>PINK</b> 1. In addition, the disruption of the Hsp 90 -PINK 1 interaction increased mitochondrial <b>PINK</b> 1 level. Conclusion Together, we believe that once <b>PINK</b> 1 enters the mitochondria, <b>PINK</b> 1 adopts a tethered topology because the transmembrane domain and the kinase domain prevent <b>PINK</b> 1 forward movement into the mitochondria. Subsequent proteolysis downstream of the transmembrane domain then releases <b>PINK</b> 1 for retrograde movement while <b>PINK</b> 1 kinase domain interacts with Hsp 90 chaperone. The significance of this dual localization could mean that <b>PINK</b> 1 has compartmental-specific functions. </p...|$|R
