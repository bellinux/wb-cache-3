5|$|The {{international}} community maintained that Rajoelina's legitimacy was conditional to {{free and fair}} elections. A number of key international organizations in which Madagascar had been a member, including the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African Union, withheld recognition of Rajoelina's legitimacy throughout his tenure. The United States, Madagascar's largest bilateral donor and provider of humanitarian aid, also refused to acknowledge the Rajoelina administration. The United Nations responded to the power transfer by freezing 600 million euros in <b>planned</b> <b>aid.</b> The United States suspended Madagascar {{from the list of}} beneficiaries of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which had ensured preferential tariffs for the import of Malagasy textiles. This sanction resulted in the loss of over 50,000 jobs and dealt a severe blow to the textile sector, which had accounted for half of Madagascar's exports. Rajoelina initially sought to persuade former donors to recommence their support; when these efforts failed to yield results, he explored the possibility of foregoing the support of traditional partners through new or strengthened relations with such alternatives as Libya, China and Saudi Arabia but was again unable to secure the desired partnerships.|$|E
500|$|On 28 August 2009, Iceland's {{parliament}} voted 34–15 (with 14 abstentions) {{to approve}} a bill (commonly {{referred to as the}} Icesave bill) to pay the United Kingdom and the Netherlands more than $5 billion lost in Icelandic deposit accounts. Initially opposed in June, the bill was passed after amendments were added which set a ceiling on the payment based on the country's gross domestic product. Opponents of the bill argued that Icelanders, already reeling from the crisis, should not have to pay for mistakes made by private banks under the watch of other governments. However, the government argued that if the bill failed to pass, the UK and the Netherlands might retaliate by blocking a <b>planned</b> <b>aid</b> package for Iceland from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Under the deal, up to 4% of Iceland's gross domestic product (GDP) will be paid to the UK, in sterling terms, from 2017–2023 while the Netherlands will receive up to 2% of Iceland's GDP, in euro terms, for the same period.

50|$|At the {{parliamentary}} vote, the 15 {{opponents of the}} bill had argued that no clear legal obligation existed for the Icelandic state to pay/guarantee for those lost deposits that Tryggingarsjóður potentially {{could not afford to}} cover by itself. The government however argued, that if the parliament failed to pass the bill, then Britain and the Netherlands might retaliate by blocking a <b>planned</b> <b>aid</b> package for Iceland from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). After unilaterally having amended the bill with a special ceiling for the state's guaranteed repayment, which greatly reduced the risk and liabilities for the Icelandic state, the two government parties voted through the bill in the parliament. President Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson signed and enacted the bill on 2 September 2009.|$|E

40|$|In {{considering}} {{the position of}} community engagement within planning {{in a time of}} neo-liberalism and a context of ‘neo-communitarian localism’ (cf. Jessop, 2002; DeFilippis, 2004), this paper reviews the role and relevance of <b>Planning</b> <b>Aid</b> in terms of its performance and aspirations in guiding and transforming planning practice (Friedmann, 1973; 1987; 2011) since its inception in 1973. In doing this we reflect on the critiques of <b>Planning</b> <b>Aid</b> performance provided by Allmendinger (2004) and bring the account up-to-date following on from past considerations (e. g. Bidwell and Edgar, 1982; Thomas, 1992; Brownill and Carpenter, 2007 a,b; Carpenter and Brownill, 2008) and prompted by the 35 years since the University of Reading produced the first published work reviewing <b>Planning</b> <b>Aid</b> (Curtis and Edwards, 1980). Our paper is timely given renewed attacks on planning, the implementation of a form of localism and reductions in funding for planning in a time of austerity. Our view is that the need for forms of ‘neo-advocacy’ planning and community development are perhaps even more necessary now, given the continuing under-representation of lower income groups, minority groups and to allow for the expression of alternative planning futures. Thus further consideration of how to ensure that <b>Planning</b> <b>Aid</b> functions are sustained and understood requires the attention of policymakers and the planning profession more widely...|$|R

40|$|Handling {{en route}} {{emergencies}} in modern transport aircraft through adequate teamwork between the pilot, {{the crew and}} the aircraft’s automation systems is an ongoing and active field of research.

This paper highlights the pilot evaluation results of a human factors study as part of such a proposed automated <b>planning</b> <b>aid.</b> Focusing on the interactions between the pilot and the automated <b>planning</b> <b>aid,</b> the presented results suggest that a particular implementation of the pilot aid interface, which uses a simple dial to sort the most promising landing sites, was effective. This selectable sorting capability, motivated by the anticipated cognitive mode of the pilot crew, improved the quality of the selected site for the majority of the cases tested.
