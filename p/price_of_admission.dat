The moral that the association aims to promote is that every person {{has the right to}} attend cultural events, and that culture should not be a luxury, rather it should be a right.|$|R
25|$|While she {{was dancing}} at the Hyperion Theater at Yale University, in November 1911, {{students}} rushed the stage. The Yale News had complained about ticket {{prices for the}} production being raised to $2. The performance followed the Yale - Princeton University football game played earlier the same day. The inflated <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> {{is thought to have}} triggered the students to pull the seats to pieces and proceed with the outbreak. Deslys retreated to her room while stage hands used fire extinguishers to subdue the students. The same month Deslys performed at the Winter Garden Theater in a production of Vera Violetta. In 1913 Deslys appeared with Al Jolson (in blackface) in the musical comedy The Honeymoon Express.|$|E

The name of Ibsen occupied a prominent place upon the boards.

[...] Vozick-Levinson stated that while the album's second disc only contains four tracks that were unreleased, that included a [...] "fairly unremarkable" [...] spoken-word poem, after hearing Jackson [...] "work out the vocal harmonies" [...] for [...] "Beat It," [...] he in particular, felt that This Is It was [...] "well worth the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> (or at least a healthy chunk of it)." [...] Brian Linder of IGN described This Is It as a [...] "freshly designed" [...] release of a greatest hits album, and that the album's tracks of an all-vocal arrangement of [...] "Beat It" [...] was [...] "particularly awesome" [...] and the acoustic version of [...] "She's Out of My Life" [...] allows Jackson's [...] "vocals to shine without the distraction of dated '70s musical underpinnings."

He made some changes in the performances, raised the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission,</b> and provided horse patrols, to guard through a dangerous district the fashionable visitors whom he attracted.

In a larger one Mario, Grisi, Jenny Lind, and Alboni gave short concerts, and high as were the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission,</b> there was never a seat vacant. Conjurers had a tent, electro-biologists--then the latest rage from the United States--held their séances, and at some distance from the others Richardson's booth was in full swing.

40|$|The {{market for}} ski runs or {{amusement}} rides often features lump-sum admission tickets with no explicit price per ride. Therefore, {{the equation of}} the demand for rides to the supply involves queues, which are systematically longer during peak periods, such as weekends. Moreover, the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> tickets are much less responsive than the length of queues to variations in demand, even when these variations are predictable. We show that this method <b>of</b> <b>pricing</b> generates nearly efficient outcomes under plausible conditions. In particular, the existence of queues and the "stickiness" <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> do {{not necessarily mean that}} rides are allocated improperly or that firms choose inefficient levels of investment. We then draw an analogy between "ski-lift pricing" and the use of profit-sharing schemes in the labor market. Although firms face explicit marginal costs of labor that are sticky and less than workers' reservation wages, and although the pool of profits seems to create a common-property problem for workers, this method <b>of</b> <b>pricing</b> can approximate the competitive outcomes for employment and total labor compensation. ...|$|R

Under each heading, trends are reported and notable or recurring shows are listed.
