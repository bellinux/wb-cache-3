5|$|Beginning {{around the}} mid-20th century, Texas began to {{transform}} from a rural and agricultural state {{to one that}} was urban and industrialized. The state's population grew quickly during this period, with large levels of migration from outside the state. As {{a part of the}} Sun Belt Texas experienced strong economic growth, particularly during the 1970s and early 1980s. Texas's economy diversified, lessening its reliance on the <b>petroleum</b> <b>industry.</b> By 1990, Hispanics overtook blacks to become the largest minority group in the state.|$|E
