40|$|Copper <b>phthalocyanine</b> (CuPc) <b>blue,</b> {{commonly}} named phthalo blue is {{the most}} important synthetic organic blue pigment in the 20 th and 21 st century artists paints. Phthalo blue, which is adopted by artists since 1936, is a polymorphous pigment. Currently, the alpha, beta and epsilon CuPc polymorphs are used in artists paint formulations. The identification of the CuPc crystal form provides technical and chronological information relevant for studying artworks. Raman Spectroscopy (RS) is a very valuable technique for the detection of phthalo blue in paint layers. However, the spectral interpretation is not straightforward concerning the CuPc polymorph distinction. To overcome the problem we have previously developed a procedure combining RS and chemometrical analysis. The experimental results that we obtained have demonstrated its efficiency for predicting the CuPc crystal form in unknown paint samples. In the present work, this procedure was applied on oil-based and acrylic paints from Sam Francis’ studio and the Getty Conservation Institute (GCI) Reference Collection. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The identification of the CuPc crystalline structure can provide useful technical and chronological information for the study of works of art. Although when a CuPc blue pigment is identified, its crystalline structure often remains unspecified despite the interest for conservation science. In this study, X-ray powder diffraction, attenuated total reflectance micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and micro-Raman spectroscopy analyses have been carried out on 15 dry pigment samples of CuPc and acrylic, vinylic, alkyd, arabic gum and oil-based artists' paints. By using the polymorphic markers underlined for dry pigments, the CuPc crystalline structure has been successfully identified for most of the analysed artists' paints.

5000|$|Painters deal {{practically}} with pigments, so [...] "blue" [...] for {{a painter}} {{can be any}} of the blues: <b>phthalocyanine</b> <b>blue,</b> Prussian blue, indigo, cobalt, ultramarine, and so on. Psychological and symbolical meanings of color are not, strictly speaking, means of painting. Colors only add to the potential, derived context of meanings, and because of this, the perception of a painting is highly subjective. The analogy with music is quite clear—sound in music (like a C note) is analogous to [...] "light" [...] in painting, [...] "shades" [...] to dynamics, and [...] "coloration" [...] is to painting as the specific timbre of musical instruments is to music. These elements do not necessarily form a melody (in music) of themselves; rather, they can add different contexts to it.|$|E
5000|$|Approximately 25% of all {{artificial}} organic pigments are phthalocyanine derivatives. [...] Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) dyes {{are produced}} by introducing solubilizing groups, such as one or more sulfonic acid functions. These dyes find extensive use in various areas of textile dyeing (Direct dyes for cotton), for spin dyeing and in the paper industry. Direct blue 86 is the sodium salt of CuPc-sulfonic acid, whereas direct blue 199 is the quaternary ammonium salt of the CuPc-sulfonic acid. The quaternary ammonium salts of these sulfonic acids are used as solvent dyes because of their solubility in organic solvents, e.g. Solvent Blue 38 and Solvent Blue 48. The dye derived from cobalt phthalocyanine and an amine is Phthalogen Dye IBN. 1,3-Diiminoisoindolene, the intermediate formed during phthalocyanine manufacture, used in combination with a copper salt affords the dye GK 161. <b>Phthalocyanine</b> <b>Blue</b> BN is also used as a source material for manufacture of Phthalocyanine Green G.|$|E

5000|$|Nucleic acids are {{generally}} basophilic {{because they have}} a very high density of negative charge due to the sugar phosphate backbone. However, in contrast to other basic i.e. cationic dyes, Alcian blue usually (given the right pH and salt concentrations, and normal temperature and duration in minutes, not hours) preferably stains acidic glycosaminoglycans but not the chromatin and nissel substance, the mechanism of which had been a mystery {{for a long time and}} various theories were proposed. Though the presumed basis of the staining is its positive charge attracted to negative structures (e.g. acidic sugars), bulkiness (width 2.5-3 nm, compared to toluidine blue ~0.7 x1.1 nm) makes its diffusion very slow in less permeable parts of the tissue and thus prevent it from staining highly negative yet compact structures such as chromatin and nissl substance. However prolonged staining (few days at 25 °C) or DNA denaturing conditions may allow Alcian blue to also stain the nucleus. The isolation of the positive charge from the aromatic electron cloud by the intervening methylene bridges makes the localized positive charged regions [...] "hard" [...] ions in contrast to soft ions where the charge is delocalized over the whole aromatic pi cloud. When these hard cations encounter the hard anions e.g. in form of sulfate they form salts without regard for the precise chemical nature of the anion. The resulting salts are highly stable but can be slowly exchanged with high concentration of salts. Washing with water or alkali treatment after staining causes base catalyzed hydrolysis and removal of the pendant positively charged side chains and the resulting compound is <b>Phthalocyanine</b> <b>Blue,</b> which forms a blue water-insoluble dye precipitate. The precipitates are so robust that they withstand harsh conditions like PAS or other counterstaining and also dehydration and embedding treatments (in contrast toluidine blue is partially extracted away during dehydration). This unleachability is the chemical basis of the ingrain dyeing for which AB (Ingrain blue 1) was originally designed by the dye industry.|$|E

30|$|The {{positive}} results obtained by Leptosphaerulina sp. {{and the differences}} obtained between the dyes are explained by {{the differences in the}} biochemistry of the decolorization process. The azoic dyes, Remazol black and Novacron red, are degraded principally by an enzymatic process (Michniewicz et al. 2008); whereas, <b>phthalocyanine</b> dyes (Turquoise <b>Blue)</b> are degraded by a mixture of biophysical and biochemical process. In this case, Turquoise Blue is initially absorbed by the cell wall and after that degraded by the ligninolytic enzymes (Swamy and Ramsay 1999; Kirby et al. 2000). Both types of degradation have a different physiological explanation. In the azoic dyes case, the chemical structure of azoic dyes is related with the presence of phenol groups. Phenol groups are the principal substrate for the ligninolytic enzymes; therefore, the enzymatic enzymes degrade the dye by using the structural similarity between azoic dyes and lignin (Kokol et al. 2007). On the other hand, phthalocyanine dyes are adsorbed in the membrane because they have a copper atom in their structure, copper atoms tend to be absorbed by ligninolytic fungus to further include them in the structure of their enzymes, in this case the dye molecule is absorbed and further degraded by the enzymatic enzymes (Jarosz-Wilkołazka et al. 2002).|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decade, the {{requirement}} of medical, food and environmental analysis for fast, reliable and inexpensive screening methods {{has given rise to}} increasing interest in the field of disposable amperometric biosensors. Screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE) are the most attractive basis for the construction of such devices as they combine good electrochemical properties with low manufacturing cost. However, effective immobilisation of enzymes on the surface of SPCE is difficult due to the inert nature of the carbon material. This thesis shows that poly(ethyleimine) (PE!) deposited onto the screen-printed carbon surface {{can be used as a}} universal and versatile platform for the multipoint electrostatic adsorption of various enzymes. Such electrostatic immobilisation can be significantly stabilised by biomimetic condensation of silicic acid which reinforces the PEI-enzyme complexes through gentle, non-covalent concreting of the polymeric backbone with silica. Another important problem in the assembly of amperometric biosensors on the basis of SPCE is the signal generation since many redox reactions which govern the sensitivity of an amperometric biosensor, e. g. oxidation of hydrogen peroxide, proceed with difficulty on the screen-printed carbon surface. In order to address this issue, simple cost-effective techniques for doping SPCE with redox mediators, cobalt <b>phthalocyanine</b> and Prussian <b>Blue,</b> have been developed. When applied to PEI-modified electrodes these techniques allowed the construction of amperometric biosensors sensitive to glucose, acetylcholine or organophosphate inhibitors.
