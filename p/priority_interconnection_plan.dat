40|$|The European {{transmission}} grid is facing an investment challenge. There {{is a strong}} call for more transmission capacity. At the same time, the investment climate is fierce and troubled by public opposition, a complex regulatory framework, etc. Many transmission capacity expansion projects are delayed or canceled. In this paper different technology options suitable for increasing transmission capacity are discussed. The aim is to provide policy-makers with information on technologies without going too much into technical details. The focus is on opportunities and limitations to implement various technological alternatives in practice, including technical solutions that go beyond constructing new connection lines. The criteria used in this technology assessment {{are based on the}} obstacles reported in the European <b>Priority</b> <b>Interconnection</b> <b>Plan.</b> This ensures a realistic approach based on problems encountered in real projects. Although AC overhead lines (OHL) will remain the standard solution for grid expansion, it is argued that different technology options can overcome many obstacles that OHL face. Additionally, it is illustrated that the higher investment costs for some solutions can be offset with an increased benefit, e. g. by accomplishing investments with smaller delays due to fewer obstacles encountered. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Power systems {{conventionally}} {{have been}} designed and operated to facilitate electrical energy transportation from large centralised power plants to distant load centres. It is currently under development towards the purpose {{of being able to}} facilitate more distributed generation from renewable energy sources (RES), for instance wind and solar energy. Increasing the share of RES would allow us to replace carbon-intensive energy sources and achieve significant reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions, establish vast and inexhaustible energy supply, and offer more affordable electricity price amongst others. On the other hand, the integration of RES to the existing power systems brings additional challenges to system planners and operators. Transmission system operators (TSOs) are already facing operational challenges of high power flows starting in the areas with large wind power installations in Germany to the remote load centres, observing substantial loop flows through Poland and the Czech Republic. As a consequence, the daily operation of Europe's electricity system is increasingly threatened by the risks of blackouts or component failures with wide-reaching impact. According to ENTSO-E the changing generation mix will contribute to upcoming congestion situations, resulting in a limitation in possible exports. The Commission's <b>Priority</b> <b>Interconnection</b> <b>Plan</b> also points out the danger arising from the operation of networks closer to their physical limits. It is of utmost importance to develop a methodology that is able to identify transmission network bottlenecks, i. e. those components with a high potential to be the origin of a major blackout or cascading event, meanwhile incorporating the uncertainties caused by the RES integration as well as the diversified energy policies in terms of future generation mixes. The improvement of the transmission and distribution infrastructure begins with the identication of its current shortcomings. Another aspect of power system assessment is to investigate transmission congestions, which is labelled as the 'symptom' of the insufficient transfer capacity when the existing capacity cannot facilitate the desired electricity demand. The reduction of congestions is an indicator of social and economic welfare assuming equitable distribution of benefits under the goal of the European Union to develop an integrated market as stated in the ENTSO-E Ten Year Development Plan. A relative small number of additional capacity could lead to major economic benefits for many consumers, as advised by US Department of Energy. For such demanding requests on the power system assessment, there is strong need to translate the explained challenges into an engineering problem, which requires a clear technical vision of the aforementioned challenges in the power system operation and planning, in addition to a clear understanding of power system modelling with substantial supporting material of mathematics. To substantiate the knowledge of both engineering and mathematics, the thesis provides a structured way of elaborating the engineering background of power systems as well as the mathematical formulations that are essential for understanding the novelty of the proposed methods (Chapters 2, 3 and 4 of this thesis). Chapter 5 provides a method for the transmission network assessment taking into account the wind stochasticity using a unified Monte-Carlo method and Copula approach. Two main reasons of using the Monte-Carlo method are a) the anti-aliasing property and b) the ability to quickly approximate the answer that otherwise would be very computation-intensive. The methodology is firstly elaborated and applied to a single scenario study, and further enhanced to a more general approach that allows taking into account multiple scenarios caused by uncertainties raised from energy policy perspectives. The solution set of the multiple scenario study captures the impact of uncertainties of all energy policy perspectives without increasing the size of stochastic infeed inputs. A new method for the transmission expansion planning problem is presented in Chapter 6 and 7, which separate the topic into snapshot-based and multi-stage expansion planning methods. Actively optimising Lagrangian multipliers as 'primal' variables in the optimization problem is used as a tool for the network expansion, providing the copper-plate topology from either a congested or an infeasible grid configuration. The method also emphasizes the over-investment issues by introducing a maximum allowable overloading factor, to prevent a large amount of inefficient investment on 'minor' congestions. The multi-stage expansion planning method further strengthens the snapshot-based method by proposing the optimal network topology at different time horizon chronologically, taking into account the possible scenarios of conventional generation mix, load and wind energy infeed at each stage. The modular approach of functionally partitioning the multi-stage planning methodology offers additional advantages including a) reducing computational effort, b) allowing easy modification of the existing modules, and c) allowing adaptation of other modules for enhancement, etc. The final optimal expansion plan at each stages guarantees the copper-plate network structure subject to various scenarios and wind generation infeeds at the lowest operational and investment costs.

Under this optional <b>interconnection</b> <b>plan,</b> BPA would integrate electric power from the Project into the FCRTS at a point adjacent to Clatskanie People's Utility District (CPUD) existing Wauna Substation. In order to deliver power to this location, CPUD would develop a new substation (Bradbury Substation) at a site near the Project and a new 230 -kV transmission line from there to CPUD's Wauna Substation, which is already connected to the FCRTS. As part of this revised decision, BPA will facilitate CPUD development of the Bradbury-Wauna transmission line by allowing joint use of BPA right-of-way. This will involve reconstructing a section of BPA's 115 -kV Allston-Astoria No. 1 transmission line from single-circuit H-frame wood-pole design to double-circuit single metal pole design.

Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are isolated from the energy system of the EU and cannot create free and open energy market. The theory of neo-functionalism helps me to understand the main principles of integration. The key concept of the theory is the spillover process. The sectoral spillover process explains interdependence of political and economic integration and the geographic spillover process shows the principles of regional integration. One of the main neo-functionalists Ernst Haas points out that states which are excluded from the integration process influence the integration.

The author stresses {{that one of the}} most acute problems for the EU today is overcoming isolation of the energy systems of the Baltic States (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia) from that of the major part of the EU. This task has become especially relevant after the closing of the Ignalina NPP (Lithuania), which used to be the primary energy source for the three Baltic States. The {{article examines}} key projects of the construction of new international power transmission lines in the framework of the Baltic Energy Market <b>Interconnection</b> <b>Plan</b> (BEMIP) and the prospects of the Visaginas NPP (Lithuania) in solving energy problems of the Baltic States.

40|$|This {{viewpoint}} reviews {{renewable energy}} development in 14 markets that differ in market structure (restructured vs. not restructured), use of feed-in-tariff (FIT) (yes vs. no), transmission planning (anticipatory vs. reactive), and transmission interconnection cost allocated to a renewable generator (high vs. low). We find that market restructuring {{is not a}} primary driver of renewable energy development. Renewable generation has the highest percent of total installed capacity in markets that use a FIT, employ anticipatory transmission planning, and have loads or end-users paying for most, if not all, of the transmission interconnection costs. In contrast, renewable developers have been less successful in markets that do not use a FIT, employ reactive transmission planning, and have generators paying for most, if not all, of the transmission interconnection costs. While these policies can lead to higher penetration of renewable energy in the short run, their high cost to ratepayers can threaten the economic sustainability of renewable energy in the long-run.
