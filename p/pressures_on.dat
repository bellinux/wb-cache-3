5|$|There {{is also a}} plan to {{significantly}} redevelop {{the centre of the}} University Precinct in the coming years. The first step began in September 2011, with the start of construction of a state-of-the-art Life Sciences building.

5|$|An {{international}} peace conference {{was held in}} Kano in Nigeria, in which Chad's bordering states participated along with Malloum, Habré, and Goukouni. The Kano Accord was signed on 16 March by all those present, and Malloum resigned, replaced by a Council of State under the chairmanship of Goukouni. This {{was a result of}} Nigerian and French <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> Goukouni and Habré to share power; the French in particular saw this as part of their strategy to cut all ties between Goukouni and Gaddafi. A few weeks later, the same factions formed the Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT), kept together to a considerable extent by the common desire to see Libya out of Chad.|$|E
5|$|Business {{aviation}} {{has shown}} strong growth, although {{the numbers of}} aircraft on the UK register have declined. This reflects a shift away from turboprop aircraft towards foreign-registered business jets based in the UK, which {{are estimated to be}} growing in numbers. However, twin piston-engined aircraft numbers have declined significantly, reflecting <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> the light air-taxi segment from increasingly flexible and cheaper scheduled services, and a more sophisticated corporate charter business. The amount of flight training conducted by UK schools has declined, largely at the hands of competition from foreign schools, which benefit from lower costs and better weather.|$|E
50|$|The {{force is}} exerted {{by the air}} as a <b>pressure</b> {{difference}} <b>on</b> the airfoil's surfaces. Pressure in a fluid is always positive in an absolute sense, so that pressure must always {{be thought of as}} pushing, and never as pulling. The pressure thus pushes inward on the airfoil everywhere on both the upper and lower surfaces. The flowing air reacts to the presence of the wing by reducing the <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the wing's upper surface and increasing the <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the lower surface. The <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the lower surface pushes up harder than the reduced <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the upper surface pushes down, and the net result is upward lift.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with many}} other bits, a pelham may have a solid or a jointed mouthpiece. If solid, it may range from a nearly {{straight}} [...] "Mullen" [...] mouthpiece up to a medium port. The pelham's mouthpiece controls the <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the tongue, roof of the mouth, and bars. A mullen mouth places even <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the bars and tongue. A port places more <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the bars, and provide room for the tongue. A high port may act {{on the roof of}} the mouth as it touches, and will act as a fulcrum, amplifying the <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the bars of the mouth.|$|R

5|$|Each {{party in}} a coevolutionary {{relationship}} exerts selective <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> the other, thereby affecting each other's evolution. Coevolution includes many forms of mutualism, host-parasite, and predator-prey relationships between species, as well as competition within or between species. In many cases, the selective pressures drive an evolutionary arms race between the species involved. Pairwise or specific coevolution, between exactly two species, {{is not the only}} possibility; in guild or diffuse coevolution, several species may evolve a trait in reciprocity with a trait in another species, as has happened between the flowering plants and pollinating insects such as bees, flies, and beetles.|$|E
5|$|Endurance {{departed}} from South Georgia for the Weddell Sea on 5 December, heading for Vahsel Bay. As the ship moved southward navigating in ice, first year ice was encountered, which slowed progress. Deep in the Weddell Sea, conditions gradually grew worse until, on 19 January 1915, Endurance became frozen fast in an ice floe. On 24 February, realising {{that she would}} be trapped until the following spring, Shackleton ordered the abandonment of ship's routine and her conversion to a winter station. She drifted slowly northward with the ice through the following months. When spring arrived in September, the breaking of the ice and its later movements put extreme <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> the ship's hull.|$|E
5|$|Enron's audit {{committee}} was later criticized for its brief meetings that would cover {{large amounts of}} material. In one meeting on February 12, 2001, the committee met {{for an hour and}} a half. Enron's {{audit committee}} did not have the technical knowledge to question the auditors properly on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities. The committee was also unable to question the company's management due to <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> the committee. The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' report accused the board members of allowing conflicts of interest to impede their duties as monitoring the company's accounting practices. When Enron's scandal became public, the audit committee's conflicts of interest were regarded with suspicion.|$|E

50|$|From Bernoulli's principle, the <b>{{pressure}}</b> <b>on</b> {{the upper}} surface where the flow is moving faster {{is lower than}} the <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the lower surface where it is moving slower. This pressure difference creates a net aerodynamic force, pointing upward.|$|R
5|$|Historians {{of science}} have noted that, while Darwin {{considered}} the ideas in Wallace's paper to be {{essentially the same}} as his own, there were differences. Darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce, whereas Wallace emphasised environmental <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions, leading populations in different locations to diverge. Some historians, notably Peter J. Bowler, have suggested the possibility that in the paper he mailed to Darwin, Wallace was not discussing selection of individual variations at all but rather group selection. However, Malcolm Kottler has shown that this notion is incorrect and Wallace was indeed discussing individual variations.|$|E
5|$|Independence from Europe {{has called}} for stricter {{immigration}} policy to be implemented in the UK, but has refused to set a statistical migration target. It supports an 'Australian-style' points-based system to regulate immigration once the UK has left the European Economic Area (EEA), citing <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> population growth, housing and infrastructure. Foreigners would also face more stringent rules once they had arrived; temporary visitors would have to carry identification at all times, as well as reside in the UK for at least 10 years before becoming eligible for British citizenship. Such measures, the party hopes, would justify the reintroduction of the country's work permit scheme.|$|E
5|$|The huia {{was found}} {{throughout}} the North Island before humans arrived in New Zealand. The Māori are estimated to have arrived around 800 years ago, and {{by the arrival of}} European settlers in the 1840s, habitat destruction and hunting had reduced the bird's range to the southern North Island. However, Māori hunting <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> the huia were limited to some extent by traditional protocols. The hunting season was from May to July when the bird's plumage was in prime condition, while a rāhui (hunting ban) was enforced in spring and summer. It was not until European settlement that the huia's numbers began to decline severely, due mainly to two well-documented factors: widespread deforestation and over hunting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} know the sealing ability under axial {{alternating}} tension load, a 88. 9 mm× 6. 45 mm P 110 premium tubing connection is established with multiple linear elastic plastic finite element model, stress and contact <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> sealing surface and torque shoulder are analyzed under axial alternating tension load and 80 MPa inner pressure. The results show that tubing connection slide by the axial tension, while the maximum contact <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> seal surface reduced. With the increasing of alternating cycle, the maximum equivalent stress on seal surface increased and the maximum contact <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> seal surface decreased. And, under limited loads, contact <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> torque shoulder is affected little caused by alternating load...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{monorail}} beam (Z 206 - 25) of Chongqing straddle monorail {{transit system}} {{was selected as}} the research object. The spatial coupling vibration model of vehicle-bridge system was established and corresponding procedure was compiled. The effect of travelling, steering and stabilizing wheel pressure respectively and typical combined wheel <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the system vibration was studied. The results show that the change of wheel pressure has great effect on the response of the system. The vertical response value increases with travelling wheel pressure increasing. The lateral response value increases with steering wheel pressure increasing, while the effect of stabilizing wheel <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the response is irregular. The effect of steering wheel pressure is greater than that of stabilizing wheel <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> lateral responses. The effect of all of travelling and steering wheel pressure is greater than that of unilateral wheel <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the response. The effect tendency of stabilizing wheel <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the response is opposite to that of unilateral wheel pressure...|$|R
5|$|There {{were other}} {{financial}} <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> Frazee, despite his team's success. Ruth, {{fully aware of}} baseball's popularity and his role in it, wanted to renegotiate his contract, signed before the 1919 season for $10,000 per year through 1921. He demanded that his salary be doubled, or he would sit out the season and cash in on his popularity through other ventures. Ruth's salary demands were causing other players to ask for more money. Additionally, Frazee still owed Lannin as much as $125,000 from {{the purchase of the}} club.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{population}} density of Varanasi and {{the increasing number of}} tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The sewage problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control. Because of the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{unfavourable}} currency {{conditions and}} conflicting <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> the military budget, several prospective procurements of modern aircraft {{such as the}} SEPECAT Jaguar and the British Aerospace Sea Harrier were put on hold following the 1971 war; the indigenously developed HAL HF-24 Marut had also not been as successful as hoped, thus the IAF decided to retain the ageing fleets of Hunters and English Electric Canberra bombers. After considering several foreign aircraft to replace the Hunter, including the Dassault Mirage F1, the Saab 37 Viggen, and several Soviet models, the Indian government announced its intention to procure 200 Jaguars, {{a large portion of}} which were to be assembled domestically, in October 1978. In 1996, the last of the IAF's Hunters were phased out of service, the remaining single squadron operating the Hunter converting to the newer Sukhoi Su-30MKI.|$|E

5|$|Iowa is {{the second}} studio album by the American heavy metal band Slipknot. Released by Roadrunner Records on August 28, 2001, it was {{produced}} by Ross Robinson and Slipknot. The title derives from the band's home state, Iowa, which members have stated {{is one of their}} greatest sources of inspiration. With much anticipation for the band's second album following on the success of their 1999 self-titled debut, <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> the band were high. Their relationships with each other suffered and was later described as the darkest time of their career. It was also the first time that guitarist Jim Root had been significantly involved in a Slipknot album as Root was only featured on two songs from their debut album, due to his joining very late in recording of that release. Despite troubles within the band and with Iowas development, Slipknot promoted it for almost a year.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> O'Neill's {{colonization}} plan {{were the}} high cost of access to Earth orbit and the declining cost of energy. Building solar power stations in space was economically attractive when energy prices spiked during the 1979 oil crisis. When prices dropped in the early 1980s, funding for space solar power research dried up. His plan had also been based on NASA's estimates for the flight rate and launch cost of the Space Shuttle, numbers that turned out to have been wildly optimistic. His 1977 book quoted a Space Shuttle launch cost of $10 million, but in 1981 the subsidized price given to commercial customers started at $38 million. Eventual accounting of the full cost of a launch in 1985 raised this as high as $180 million per flight.|$|E
5|$|Peter Molyneux and James Leach came up {{with the}} idea of {{creating}} a Theme game based on a hospital, but Molyneux was not directly involved in development due to his work on Dungeon Keeper. Designers originally planned to include four distinct gameplay modes corresponding to historical time periods, but this was dropped due to time <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> the team. Multiplayer support with up to four players was added in a patch. The game received a generally positive reception, with reviewers praising the graphics and humour in particular. Theme Hospital was a commercial success, selling over 4 million copies worldwide, and was ported to the PlayStation in 1998. A Sega Saturn version was in development, but cancelled. The game was re-released on GOG.com in 2012 and Origin in 2015, and the PlayStation version was released on the PlayStation Network in Europe in 2008, Japan in 2009, and North America in 2010. Revival attempts have been made with the development of open-source remakes such as CorsixTH.|$|E
