50|$|Investigating the vaults, {{and quickly}} ruling as {{impossible}} the actual removal of many tonnes of gold via a narrow tunnel {{in the time}} available, Holmes swiftly determines what has taken place; based on {{the speed of the}} lift's descent, it should take them 45 seconds to reach the vaults, but they stopped after only 42 seconds. From this, Holmes deduces that Moriarty had an empty, duplicate vault built a few meters above the real one, subsequently <b>planting</b> <b>iron</b> bars to stop the lift reaching the real vault. While everyone puzzled over how the bars of gold were stolen from the false vault, Moriarty would actually be stealing them from the real one below. In a final confrontation in New York's underground, Moriarty escapes.|$|E
5000|$|He {{maintained}} his father's farm in Villa d'Ogna after following his father's pious and industrious example and he later married. His father had also taught him penitential practices that later fructified in his son's life. Alberto's wife made no initial objections to his generous example and his giving {{to the poor}} but {{the death of her}} father-in-law saw her begin to criticize his work. She soon ceased her nagging and in a sudden conversion began to follow his example though she later died not long after - the couple were childless. His parents and wife died sometime between 1240 and 1255. He gained a formidable reputation as one who dedicated his life to aiding the poor in whatever manner was available. He travelled on nine pilgrimages to Rome and also made eight visits to Santiago de Compostela and one to Jerusalem. While in Rome he manifested his obedience to the pontiffs of the times that he visited such as Pope Celestine IV and Pope Alexander IV. He would also visit the hospitals of Rome to comfort the ill and to encourage them to confess their sins. The farmer later settled in Cremona in order to continue his farming and arrived there at harvest time working in the fields with the moniker of [...] "the diligent worker". Alberto worked twice as harder as was expected of a man and received twice as much in wages as a result of this. Jealous companions also sought to curb this with <b>planting</b> <b>iron</b> in his fields so that he would damage his tools though this failed. He often liked to walk along chanting Psalms; he also often recited the Divine Office.|$|E

50|$|DTPA is {{also used}} as a chelate for {{aquarium}} <b>plant</b> fertilizer, specifically <b>iron,</b> an essential micronutrient typically needed in substantial quantities by all plants. Chelates are dissolved organic substances that bind to metals and prevent them from forming larger molecules through oxidation. FeDTPA is often sold under the name iron chelate 10% or 11% when used {{for the purpose of}} aquarium <b>plant</b> fertilization. <b>Iron</b> typically found in the aquarium water column has been converted into the ferric state (Fe3+) since it is in the presence of dissolved oxygen. However <b>plants</b> require <b>iron</b> in the ferrous state (Fe2+), therefore additional energy must be expended in order to extract the ferric iron from the water column and convert it to the ferrous form. When used to chelate iron fertilizer DTPA ensures that the iron is kept in the ferrous state (Fe2+) over time so it can be utilized by aquatic plants without expending valuable energy.|$|R
40|$|<b>Plants</b> growing under <b>iron</b> {{deficiency}} {{suffer from}} multiple physiological defects. Although {{the effects of}} microRNA 156 (miR 156) on multiple aspects of plant development have been investigated, a possible role of miR 156 in <b>plant</b> <b>iron</b> homeostasis has not been shown. By employing next-generation RNA-sequencing, the current research demonstrated that multiple iron homeostasis-related genes, including ones coding for Ferritins, group Ib bHLH transcription factors, and key enzymes involved in iron uptake, were differentially expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana plants overexpressing miR 156. Overexpression of miR 156 also enhanced Arabidopsis growth under iron-deficiency. In addition, expression analysis revealed that miR 156 is a positive regulator of FIT and PYE genes partially through targeting SPL 9 and SPL 15. By using Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation qPCR assay, SPL 9 and SPL 15 {{were found to have}} strong binding capability to the promoters of PYE and FIT.

40|$|Root exudate {{composition}} and quantity vary {{in relation to}} plant nutritional status, but {{the impact of the}} differences on rhizosphere microbial communities is not known. To examine this question, we performed an experiment with barley (Hordeum vulgare) plants under iron-limiting and iron-sufficient growth conditions. Plants were grown in an iron-limiting soil in root box microcosms. One-half of the plants were treated with foliar iron every day to inhibit phytosiderophore production and to alter root exudate composition. After 30 days, the bacterial communities associated with different root zones, including the primary root tips, nonelongating secondary root tips, sites of lateral root emergence, and older roots distal from the tip, were characterized by using 16 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) fingerprints generated by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Our results showed that the microbial communities associated with the different root locations produced many common 16 S rDNA bands but that the communities could be distinguished by using correspondence analysis. Approximately 40 % of the variation between communities could be attributed to <b>plant</b> <b>iron</b> nutritional status. A sequence analysis of clones generated from a single 16 S rDNA band obtained at all of the root locations revealed that there were taxonomically different species in the same band, suggesting that the resolving power of DGGE for characterization of community structure at the species level is limited. Our results suggest that the bacterial communities in the rhizosphere are substantially different in different root zones and that a rhizosphere community may be altered by changes in root exudate composition caused by changes in <b>plant</b> <b>iron</b> nutritional status...|$|R
