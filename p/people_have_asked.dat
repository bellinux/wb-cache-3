25|$|Over the years, many <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> me how I run the Naval Reactors Program, so {{that they}} might find some benefit for their own work. I am always chagrined at the {{tendency}} of people to expect that I have a simple, easy gimmick that makes my program function. Any successful program functions as an integrated whole of many factors. Trying to select one aspect as the key one will not work. Each element depends on all the others.|$|E
25|$|<b>People</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked,</b> so {{what are}} the demands? What are the demands all of these people are making? Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social {{equality}} and economic justice are impossible demands. And the impossible demands, they say, are just not practical. If hope is an impossible demand, then we demand the impossible – that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible. If it is impossible to demand that those who profit from the recession redistribute their wealth and cease their greed, then yes, we demand the impossible.|$|E

Richards noted that although any similarities were unintended, companions were archetypal [...] "to a degree".|$|R
5000|$|According to Mark Rosewater, [...] "There is {{something}} that <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been <b>asking</b> us to do {{for quite a while}} that we’re finally bringing back after a long absence in Magic, and there’s something that <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been <b>asking</b> us to do that we have never done {{that for the first time}} we’re doing in Khans of Tarkir", meaning the return of the keyword [...] "morph" [...] and creating a set themed around wedges, respectively. In addition, allied [...] "fetchlands" [...] were reprinted, after originally being seen in Onslaught.|$|R
500|$|In mid-2007, Hornish drove Penske's No. 27 Dodge Charger in an ARCA Re/Max Series race at Michigan International Speedway. Starting in {{the pole}} position, {{he led the}} first 29 laps of the race before being passed by {{eventual}} winner Erik Darnell and finishing second. After the race, he called the transition to stock cars a [...] "challenge": [...] "I'm a student at this, still trying {{to learn as much}} as I can. A lot of <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> me what the toughest transition is, coming over here from the IndyCars and doing these stock car races, and really it's the fact I don't get much practice time." ...|$|E
500|$|Barnes played {{carefully}} on the still suspect pitch the following day and {{late in the afternoon}} Bradman, lower in the order than usual due to a leg injury, joined Barnes with the score at 4/159. Over six and a half hours later, Bradman was out for 234. Barnes was dismissed just four balls later, also for 234, having batted for over ten hours. In his autobiography, Barnes stated that the coincidence of scores was intended. [...] "Lots of <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> me whether I deliberately threw my wicket away at 234. The answer is yes." [...] He confirmed to an interviewer many years later that [...] "it wouldn't be right for someone to make more runs than Sir Donald Bradman".|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Mouton {{became the}} first {{president}} of the FIA's Women & Motor Sport Commission. She stated that [...] "for many years <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> me why there have been no women following in my footsteps. I really hope the Commission can help answer that question and that we can attract and support women in all areas of our sport." [...] Having already headed a working group on the future of rallying, Mouton was appointed FIA's manager in the World Rally Championship in 2011. Mouton also serves in the nomination committee of the Rally Hall of Fame. In March 2012, she recused herself after becoming a candidate for nomination. Mouton was inducted into the Hall of Fame along with two-time world champion Carlos Sainz.|$|E
50|$|In 1902 Lucas and his {{brothers}} Despard and Will founded Estancia Viamonte {{in the northern part}} of Tierra del Fuego. The new trail was used to transport sheep between the two estancias. The Ona <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> for their help in finding a place of shelter from some of the pressures they were under. The Bridges provided them with areas on their estancias where they could live traditionally. Descendants of the brothers continue to live and work at the estancias.|$|R

5000|$|Most contactees of {{this period}} became (or already were) leaders in new {{paradigm}} movements to inform people of extraterrestrial intelligent life, including George Adamski, George Van Tassel, Daniel Fry, George King and many others. Mr Bethurum made it known that the space <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> him to consider creating a place of learning {{for those who were}} interested in considering the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligent life, with Mr Bethurum as facilitator. The Sanctuary of Thought, a philosophical group, was subsequently created near Prescott, Arizona. Mr Bethurum claimed to possess physical evidence such as unique items given to him by Captain Aura Rhanes.|$|R
500|$|Hughes won the grudge {{match against}} Serra at UFC 98: Evans vs. Machida via {{unanimous}} decision. In the first round, both fighters collided heads, and Hughes got {{the worst of}} it. Despite this, Serra could not finish the fight and Hughes recovered rapidly. In the second stanza, Hughes controlled his opponent {{on the ground with}} his wrestling skills. The final round saw the former champions taking each other down and exchanging punches. The back and forth action rewarded both competitors with Fight of the Night honors. After the fight Hughes and Serra embraced each other and ended their feud. Hughes posted on his blog: [...] "When the fight was over, I was pretty confident I was going to get my hand raised. Some <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> why I raised his hand at the end. Actually I didn't, he raised mine. He also told me that, no matter what the decision was, he was done with the rivalry". After the fight Hughes said, [...] "I think I have a few more fights left in me." ...|$|E
500|$|When first approved, the {{extension}} of I-70 from Denver to Cove Fort was criticized in some area newspapers as a road to nowhere; an information liaison specialist with the U.S. Department of Transportation in Baltimore, Maryland—the eastern terminus of I-70—claims <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> [...] "did we think Baltimoreans were so desperate to get to Cove Fort that we {{were willing to pay}} $4 billion to get them there?" [...] However, a resident engineer with the USDOT has called {{the extension}} one of the [...] "crown jewels" [...] of the Interstate Highway System. In Colorado, the freeway helped unite the state, despite the two halves being separated by the formidable Rocky Mountains. The Eisenhower Tunnel alone is credited with saving up to an hour from the drive across the state. Prior to I-70's construction, the highway through Glenwood Canyon {{was one of the most}} dangerous in the state. With the improvements, the accident rate has dropped 40% even though traffic through the canyon has substantially increased. The Colorado Department of Transportation is considering the nomination of various portions of I-70 as a National Historic Landmark, even though the freeway will not qualify as historical for several decades.|$|E

2500|$|By {{later in}} December, Kennedy had mounted {{a concerted effort}} to gain support around the state, and had made several trips and {{appearances}} as well. [...] Kennedy's appointment was supported by Congresswoman Louise Slaughter, State Assemblyman Vito Lopez, New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, former New York City Mayor Ed Koch and the New York Post editorial page. [...] She received criticism for not voting in a number of Democratic primaries and general elections since registering in 1988 in New York City and also for not providing details about her political views. Kennedy declined to make disclosures of her financial dealings or other personal matters, stating that she would not release the information publicly unless she was selected by Paterson, at which time she would be subject to the same background checks as all appointees. Kennedy acknowledged {{that she was going to}} have to prove herself: [...] "Going into politics is something <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> me about forever. When this opportunity came along, which was sort of unexpected, I thought, `Well, maybe now. How about now?' [...] work twice as hard as anybody else ... I am an unconventional choice ... We're starting to see there are many ways into public life and public service." ...|$|E
2500|$|I had {{a terrific}} {{friendship}} with Sheila Florance. In fact she acted in {{my very first}} film, and we always used to joke that I would make her a star. When I heard suddenly that she was dying of cancer I visited her immediately. There was no sentimentality or anything on her part—she was an incredible woman—but she said jokingly, 'There is still time to turn me into a star, but let's be quick.' I went home and spent three days and three nights writing the script and then with Barry Dickins and Sheila we did another draft. She was given eight weeks to live and so we made A Woman's Tale with this hanging over us. This motivated us, of course, but Sheila had a degree of greatness about her. She was a very powerful woman. It was an amazing challenge {{to make a film}} about life, in the face of death. To get the money of course was impossible and I had to pawn everything I had. <b>People</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> me how we did it but to some extent we were idiotically courageous in taking this risk. Sheila and I joked all the time. I would say to Sheila, [...] "Please don't die on me or you'll kill me". She would reply, [...] "Don't worry I'll be a good girl." ...|$|E

25|$|He {{succeeded in}} 1915 in {{reaching}} an agreement {{by which the}} warring parties promised not to let Prisoners of War (POWs) work on Sundays and holidays. Several individuals on both sides were spared the death penalty after his intervention. Hostages were exchanged and corpses repatriated. The Pope founded the Opera dei Prigionieri to assist in distributing information on prisoners. By {{the end of the}} war, some 600,000 items of correspondence were processed. Almost a third of it concerned missing persons. Some 40,000 <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> for help in the repatriation of sick POWs and 50,000 letters were sent from families to their loved ones who were POWs.|$|R
50|$|In February 2011, the Panamanian {{government}} {{proposed a}} new mining {{law that would}} facilitate the development of mining projects in indigenous areas, while the indigenous <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> for a law banning mining in their territories. The proposal and the simultaneous launching of bids for a large copper mining project called Cerro Colorado triggered protests of indigenous people, including local communities from the Barro Blanco area, who blocked the Interamerican Highway for four days. The protests were violently suppressed. The conflict was temporarily ended through the San Felix agreement, signed {{in the village of}} San Felix. Construction of the dam began in February 2011.|$|R

Ever so many <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> mamma already as to what I should like best. Mr. MacWhapple said out plain that he would go to a hundred and fifty pounds.

Whenever {{we wish to}} mention a Thing, we use a SUBSTANTIVE: when we wish to mention an Attribute, we use an ADJECTIVE. <b>People</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> the question [...] "Can a Thing exist without any Attributes belonging to it?" [...] It is a very puzzling question, and I'm {{not going to try}} to answer it: let us turn up our noses, and treat it with contemptuous silence, as if it really wasn't worth noticing.

5000|$|Mo {{is portrayed}} as having a bubbly and warm-hearted persona. Although her {{personal}} life is often [...] "disorganised and chaotic", Mo's work life is more structured and she is an excellent doctor. Mo arrived at Holby heavily pregnant and it emerged that she was acting as a surrogate for a friend. Mo's storylines often developed through her close friendship with nurse and transplant co-ordinator Jonny Maconie (Michael Thomson). The character has also been central to a controversial storyline in which she ignored the wishes of a donor's mother.
