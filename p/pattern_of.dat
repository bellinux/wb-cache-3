Through the study of a matched sample of freshmen and seniors, three interrelated problems were investigated: age differences in <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> values, differences between usual and ideal <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> values, and the relationships between <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> values and behaviour. A study of the relevant literature reveals the <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> values do charge during the four years of college, as well as after the college years, and that differences between usual and ideal <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> values have been reported...|$|R
40|$|Small-scale {{movements}} of animals {{with respect to}} microhabitat can have important consequences for a species and its interactions with resources {{and other members of}} the local assemblage. <b>Patterns</b> <b>of</b> movement of animals in relation to habitat are sometimes predicted using their <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> distribution with respect to it. Gastropods (Bembicium auratum (Quoy and Gaimard)) are found in association with fragmented patches of oysters (Saccostrea commercialis) on sheltered rocky shores and in mangrove forests in central NSW. This paper reports an experimental test of models of movement of Bembicium based on its <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> distribution with respect to oysters. The experiment was replicated at sites on rocky shores and in mangrove forests. On rocky shores, <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> dispersal of juvenile Bembicium were as predicted by the models based on <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> distribution. It was not possible to predict <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> dispersal of adults using such models. <b>Patterns</b> <b>of</b> dispersal in mangrove forests were very different from those on rocky shores, despite similar <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> distribution. These results suggest that models predicting <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> movement of Bembicium auratum must incorporate information about the ages of the animals, the arrangement of microhabitat and the habitat they occupy. It is also clear that models based on <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> distribution of animals will not always be effective in predicting <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> movement into and out of patches of habitat and that the extrapolation of models from one habitat to another should be attempted with caution...|$|R

5|$|Beginning in 1970, {{a series}} of {{expansions}} were added to Ainsworth's original patterns. They include the following: B4 (1970), A/C (1985) D/disorganized (1986), B5 (1988, 1992) A+, C+, & Depressed (1992, 2010). At later ages, additional categories have been described. Each of these patterns reflects {{a different kind of}} attachment relationship of the infant with the mother/caregiver. An infant may have a different <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> attachment to each parent as well as to alternate caregivers. <b>Pattern</b> <b>of</b> attachment is thus {{not a part of the}} infant, but is characteristic of the protective and comforting quality of a specific relationship. These attachment patterns are associated with behavioral patterns and can help further predict a child's future personality.|$|E

To {{examine the}} {{relative}} roles {{of physical and}} biological processes involved in the recruitment of reef fishes, temporal and spatial <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> supply and recruitment were measured for two fishes, Stegastes partitus (Poey) (Pomacentridae) and Acanthurus bahianus Castelnau (Acanthuridae), recruiting to Barbados, West Indies. Nightly light-trap collections of late-stage larvae were compared with <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> juvenile recruitment. Otolith records provided estimates of larval duration and postsettlement age. Temporal <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> larval supply were similar for both species: abundances peaked during the third-quarter moon. However, spatial <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> larval supply varied between species: during large recruitment events, S. partitus larvae were more abundant in the south, A. bahianus in the north, suggesting that larval supply was not simply the result <b>of</b> passive transport. <b>Patterns</b> <b>of</b> supply were subsequently maintained (S. partitus) or modified (A. bahianus) by juveniles. In general, densities of juvenile S. partitus were evenly distributed along the coast; however, during major events, spatial <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> recruitment reflected <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> larval supply. In contrast, densities of juvenile A. bahianus were directly opposite <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> larval supply, suggesting that for some species, postsettlement processes such as habitat selection may be more influential in creating spatial <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> recruitment...|$|R
