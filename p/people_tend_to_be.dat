5|$|Cultural {{attitudes towards}} rain differ across the world. In {{temperate}} climates, <b>people</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more stressed {{when the weather}} is unstable or cloudy, with its impact greater on men than women. Rain can also bring joy, as some consider it to be soothing or enjoy the aesthetic appeal of it. In dry places, such as India, or during periods of drought, rain lifts people's moods. In Botswana, the Setswana word for rain, pula, is used as the name of the national currency, in recognition of the economic importance of rain in its country, since it has a desert climate. Several cultures have developed means of dealing with rain and have developed numerous protection devices such as umbrellas and raincoats, and diversion devices such as gutters and storm drains that lead rains to sewers. Many people find the scent during and immediately after rain pleasant or distinctive. The source of this scent is petrichor, an oil produced by plants, then absorbed by rocks and soil, and later released into the air during rainfall.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some concern}} that tying {{premiums}} to income would weaken Medicare politically {{over the long}} run, since <b>people</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more supportive of universal social programs than of means-tested ones.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{conscientiousness}} has {{a positive}} relationship with subjective well-being, particularly satisfaction with life, so highly conscientious <b>people</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> happier with their lives than those who score low on this trait.|$|E
25|$|The massif is {{sometimes}} called the fortress. The movement of <b>people</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> between the massif and the surrounding plains rather than between the {{various parts of the}} massif itself.|$|R
50|$|Tolerance for {{transgender}} <b>people</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> highest {{for television}} comedians and actors in cabaret shows, {{based on the}} traditional practice of kathoey, for example at the Alcazar Theatre in Pattaya. However, {{few studies have been}} carried out regarding the extent of discrimination or equal opportunity in other industries or areas of employment.|$|R

25|$|From a personality-traits perspective, {{there are}} a number of traits that are {{associated}} with creativity in people. Creative <b>people</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with less creativity.|$|E
25|$|The cost {{of health}} care in {{retirement}} is large because <b>people</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ill more frequently in later life. Most countries provide universal health insurance coverage for seniors, although in the United States many people retire before they become eligible for Medicare at age 65. In 2006, Medicare Part D went into effect in the United States, expanding benefits to include prescription drug coverage.|$|E
25|$|Officially, the PIRA is hierarchical, but, {{especially}} as British security forces became more effective, {{changed to a}} semiautonomous model for its operational and certain of its support cells (e.g., transportation, intelligence, cover and security). Its leadership sees itself as guiding and consensus-building. The lowest-level cells, typically of 2-5 <b>people,</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built by people with an existing personal relationship. British counterinsurgents could fairly easily understand the command structure, but not {{the workings of the}} operational cells.|$|E
40|$|Today, {{there is}} no need in the {{presentation}} of numerous facts and data about the great importance of muscular activity in order to enhance human physical performance. In recent years, the reduction of life expectancy and the vigorous activity of the middle-aged and elderly <b>people</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> constant. The presence of this trend defines a large number of social and economic factors and in this connection rational search of new ways to change this situation becomes very important...|$|R

50|$|An {{additional}} {{source of}} inspiration for Pullman's creation of the Gyptians {{may have been the}} subculture of cargo narrowboat operators that grew up in the British isles in the 18th century, in the period between the development of the canals and the emergence of the railways. The families of these operators were constantly on the move and their children were seldom educated outside the home, as a result, narrowboat <b>people</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> regarded with suspicion by landsmen.|$|R
25|$|A bias {{associated}} with low need for cognition is the halo effect, a phenomenon in which attractive or likeable <b>people</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rated as superior {{on a variety}} of other characteristics (e.g., intelligence). People low on NFC are more likely to rely on stereotypes rather than individual features of a person when rating a novel target. People high in NFC still show a halo effect however, albeit a smaller one, perhaps because their thoughts about the target are still biased by the target's attractiveness.|$|E
25|$|<b>People</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more optimistically biased {{when they}} believe they have more control over events than others. For example, {{people are more likely}} to think that they will not be harmed in a car {{accident}} if they are driving the vehicle. Another example is that if someone believes that they have a lot of control over becoming infected with HIV, they are more likely to view their risk of contracting the disease to be low. Studies have suggested that the greater perceived control someone has, the greater their optimistic bias. Stemming from this, control is a stronger factor when it comes to personal risk assessments, but not when assessing others.|$|E
25|$|Tsez lacks a {{literary}} tradition and is poorly represented in written form. Avar and Russian {{are used as}} literary languages locally, even in schools. However, {{attempts have been made}} to develop a stable orthography for the Tsez language as well as its relatives, mainly for the purpose of recording traditional folklore; thus, a Cyrillic script based on that of Avar is often used. Fluency of Avar is usually higher among men than women, and the younger <b>people</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more fluent in Russian than in Tsez, which is probably due to the lack of education in and about the language. Tsez is not taught in school and instead Avar is taught for the first five years and Russian afterwards.|$|E
5000|$|According to a 2014 poll, 57 {{percent of}} {{citizens}} of Russia regretted {{the collapse of}} the Soviet Union, while 30 percent said they did not. Elderly <b>people</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more nostalgic than younger Russians. 50% of respondents in Ukraine in a similar poll held in February 2005 stated they regret the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Similar poll conducted in 2016 showed already only 35% Ukrainians regretting the Soviet Union collapse, and 50% not regretting this.|$|R
50|$|The {{data on the}} pre-Columbian {{people and}} those of the period of {{colonization}} is scarce and obscure. Historians often described the indigenous customs that surprised them or that they disapproved of, but <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> take a position of accusation or apology, which makes it impossible to distinguish between reality and propaganda. In general, it seems that the Mexica were as homophobic as the Spanish, and that other indigenous <b>peoples</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> much more tolerant, to the point of honoring Two-Spirit people as shamans.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a broader}} sense, <b>people</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> praise what <b>is</b> theirs, often overstating qualities.|$|R
25|$|People may compete over {{getting the}} {{benefits}} of a high reputation which may cause competitive altruism. On the other hand, in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous. This may possibly be due to reasons such as psychopathy or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic. The reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present. While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present, some have shorter time horizons than others and these <b>people</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less cooperative.|$|E
25|$|CPR has {{continued}} to advance, with recent developments including an emphasis on constant, rapid heart stimulation, without respiration. Studies have shown that people who had rapid, constant hands-only chest compression 22% more likely to survive than those receiving conventional, CPR that included breathing. What's more, because <b>people</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reluctant to do mouth-to-mouth, chest-only CPR nearly doubles the chances of survival overall, by increasing the odds of receiving CPR in the first place. An analysis of 3,700 cardiac arrests published Friday in the journal Lancet found that hands-only CPR saved 22% more lives than the conventional method. All told, the switch could save up to 3,000 additional lives {{a year in the}} USA and 5,000 to 10,000 in North America and Europe, says lead author Peter Nagele of Washington University in St. Louis.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of whether people from different cultures vary in locus of control has long been of interest to social psychologists. Japanese <b>people</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more external in locus-of-control orientation than people in the U.S.; however, differences in locus of control between different countries within Europe (and between the U.S. and Europe) tend to be small. As Berry et al. pointed out in 1992, ethnic groups within the United States have been compared on locus of control; African Americans in the U.S. are more external than whites when socioeconomic status is controlled. Berry et al. also pointed out in 1992 how research on other ethnic minorities in the U.S. (such as Hispanics) has been ambiguous. More on cross-cultural variations in locus of control {{can be found in}} Shiraev and Levy (2004). Research in this area indicates that locus of control has been a useful concept for researchers in cross-cultural psychology.|$|E
50|$|Monitoring of High-Traffic Areas: Shopping centers use people {{counters}} {{to measure}} {{the number of visitors}} in a given area. People counters also assist in measuring the areas where <b>people</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> congregate, the areas where <b>people</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> gather <b>are</b> often charged higher rent.|$|R
50|$|Between the XVIII and XIX centuries, the retignanesi {{and people}} from Terrica gave away to {{a long series of}} processions in memory of Jesus, which take place in {{conjunction}} with the celebrations in Seravezza. These three villages initially had their own celebrations organised at the same time, then over time <b>people</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less involved and therefore, maybe because it was also a more democratic decision, they decide to alternate: each village would have the possibility of organizing the procession only every three years.They were built many Pietà (statues about Mary and Jesus), or works depicting Jesus in various ways.|$|R
50|$|Ralph S. Mouse (1982) is a children's {{novel by}} Beverly Cleary and {{illustrator}} Paul O. Zelinsky. It features Ralph, a mouse {{with the ability}} to speak, but only with certain <b>people,</b> who <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loners.|$|R
500|$|The {{third part}} of Who's Your City? {{examines}} {{the role of}} [...] "where someone lives" [...] as a factor of happiness. Florida's [...] "Place and Happiness Survey", which he conducted with The Gallup Organization, shows that higher incomes and levels of education produces more community satisfaction, married <b>people</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more satisfied with their community than singles, as older people as compared to younger people. [...] In addition, renters are slightly more satisfied with their living arrangements than home owners, and people are generally satisfied with where they live.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{the names}} of places and <b>people</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> highly prosaic when translated. Iqaluit, for example, is simply the plural of the noun iqaluk [...] "fish" [...] ("Arctic char", [...] "salmon" [...] or [...] "trout" [...] {{depending}} on dialect). Igloolik (Iglulik) means place with houses, a word that {{could be interpreted as}} simply town; Inuvik is place of people; Baffin Island, Qikiqtaaluk in Inuit, translates approximately to [...] "big island".|$|E
2500|$|One {{consequence}} {{is that people}} are more cooperative if {{it is more likely that}} individuals will interact again in the future. <b>People</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower. They tend to help less if they see non-cooperativeness by others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors. Simply changing the cooperative framing of a proposal may increase cooperativeness such as calling it a [...] "Community Game" [...] instead of a [...] "Wall Street Game." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tonameca is {{the only}} area which has a mixed African/Indian race {{population}} which is locally called “Abajeña.” This group developed {{from a number of}} African slaves that were introduced here. These people generally have black skin, with sharp facial features and wooly hair. Some individuals’ skin is somewhat sallow. There is another subgroup called “pintos” [...] or “Ñutis” who have patches of yellow, black, red, white and even blue on their skin due to a genetic mutation. These <b>people</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ostracized {{from the rest of the}} community and the trait is becoming rarer.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, {{there is}} {{substantial}} research indicating {{the utility of the}} measure for a few scores. Several scores correlate well with general intelligence. Interestingly, one such scale is R, the total number of responses; this reveals the questionable side-effect that more intelligent <b>people</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> elevated on many pathology scales, since many scales do not correct for high R: if a subject gives twice as many responses overall, {{it is more likely that}} some of these will seem [...] "pathological". Also correlated with intelligence are the scales for Organizational Activity, Complexity, Form Quality, and Human Figure responses.|$|E
2500|$|This {{terminology}} was {{popularized by}} the Roman Catholic priest Andrew Greeley who wrote:The central symbol (of religion) is God. One's [...] "picture" [...] of God {{is in fact}} a metaphorical narrative of God's relationship with the world and the self as part of the world. ...The Catholic [...] "classics" [...] assume a God who is present in the world, disclosing Himself in and through creation. The world and all its events, objects, and <b>people</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> somewhat like God. The Protestant classics, on the other hand, assume a God who is radically absent from the world, and who discloses (Himself) only on rare occasions (especially in Jesus Christ and Him crucified). The world and all its events, objects, and <b>people</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> radically different from God.Runar Eldebo, a Swedish seminary instructor and correspondent for Pietisten (an online ecumenical newsletter), provided a Lutheran slant on Greeley's distinction between Catholic imagination and Protestant imagination. Invoking Karl Barth, Eldebo wrote:Protestant imagination is dialectic and makes people pilgrims. It is deep in conflict and antagonistic to the ingredients of a common, human life. Catholic imagination is analogical. It is founded in creation itself and views creation as God in disguise. According to Catholic imagination, God lurks everywhere. According to Protestant imagination, Karl Barth for example, God is hidden everywhere but found only in the revelation of Jesus Christ. Therefore, according to Greeley, Protestants are never at home on earth, they are pilgrims on their way. Catholics, meanwhile, like to dwell on earth. They enjoy life and are not {{in a hurry to get}} to heaven because God lurks everywhere, especially where you do not expect her to be.|$|E

50|$|The primary diet of <b>people</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> breadfruit, taro, manioc, coconut {{and many}} kinds of fruit, which grow in abundance.

Considerable rice is also eaten. There are a great many wild pigs on the island as well as those reared on the agricultural college. The wild pigs are a cross between the Polynesian pig brought by the first settlers and the wild boar brought by the Europeans.|$|R
