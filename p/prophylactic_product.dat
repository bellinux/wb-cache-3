40|$|Public {{concerns}} over the widespread prophylactic use of antibiotics {{have led to a}} search for alternatives to dry cow therapy for the prevention of intramammary infections. A popular alternative is to infuse a teat seal at drying-off. The teat seal is a viscous non-antibiotic formulation and when it is infused into the teat canal and the teat sinus it forms an internal seal that provides a physical barrier to invasion by mastitis-causing pathogens. Enhancement of teat seal formulations may be achieved using non-antibiotic additives such as bacteriocins, potent proteins produced by some bacteria that have the ability to kill other microorganisms. This paper traces the history of investigations at Moorepark Research Centre into the efficacy of teat seal plus lacticin 3147, a bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis DPC 3147, in the prevention of intramammary infections in dry cows. Indications from on-going investigations are that a dry cow formulation combining the two products has considerable potential as a non-antibiotic <b>prophylactic</b> <b>product.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{first edition}} of the W. A. A. V. P. {{anthelmintic}} guidelines for ruminants was published in 1982. Since then improved parasitological procedures have been developed, new therapeutic and <b>prophylactic</b> <b>products</b> have appeared requiring different test methods, and registration authorities are requesting more detailed record keeping and data validation. This second edition addresses these developments and fulfills the original goal of publishing guidelines for high quality, scientifically valid testing standards for trials that would be accepted as proof of efficacy by registration authorities regardless of country of origin. This second edition includes updated guidance on standard parasitological procedures, dose titration, dose confirmation and clinical trials, and provides guidelines for evaluating products for efficacy against anthelmintic resistant parasites, persistence of activity and prophylactic activity. Tests for efficacy against nematodes, trematodes and cestodes are included...|$|R
40|$|Vaccines have {{significantly}} reduced the detrimental effects of numerous human infectious diseases worldwide, helped to reduce drastically child mortality rates and even achieved eradication of major pathogens, such as smallpox. These achievements {{have been possible}} due to a dedicated effort for vaccine research and development, {{as well as an}} effective transfer of these vaccines to public health care systems globally. Either public or private institutions have committed to developing and manufacturing vaccines for local or international population supply. However, current vaccine manufacturers worldwide {{might not be able to}} guarantee sufficient vaccine supplies for all nations when epidemics or pandemics events could take place. Currently, different countries produce their own vaccine supplies under Good Manufacturing Practices, which include the USA, Canada, China, India, some nations in Europe and South America, such as Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, France, Argentina, and Brazil, respectively. Here, we discuss some of the vaccine programs and manufacturing capacities, comparing the current models of vaccine management between industrialized and developing countries. Because local vaccine production undoubtedly provides significant benefits for the respective population, the manufacture capacity of these <b>prophylactic</b> <b>products</b> should be included in every country as a matter of national safety...|$|R
40|$|When {{administered}} in suitable amounts the {{lactic acid bacteria}} and bifidobacteria confer a health benefit on the host, the property described as probiotic [1]. Extensive investigations on biological active compounds from probiotic bacteria are directed primarily towards methods for the preparation of highly effective therapeutic and <b>prophylactic</b> <b>products</b> [2]. Among these substances are polar lipids, which can be abundant components in bacterial cell walls [3, 4]. Components from the cell wall of bifidobacteria, mainly polysaccharides and glycolipids, {{have been used as}} immunostimulants. Cell wall preparations obtained from some Bifidobacterium species actively stimulated host mediated responses in mice and at tumour sites. We describe a novel isolation procedure for polar lipids from bifidobacteria. The supercritical fluid of carbon dioxide (scCO 2) with an aqueous methanol as co-solvent was used. Schematic diagram of the scCO 2 extraction system Major glycolipids were isolated using the following scCO 2 parameters: pressure, 30 megapascals, co-solvent concentration, 10 % (9 : 1, methanol/water, v/v), dynamic flow rate: 5 g/min., extraction time and temperature, respectively: 2 times for 60 min and 55 °C. The major glycolipids were characterized by enzyme linked immunosorbent (ELISA). Sixty mg of glycolipids with high immunoreactivity were isolated from 1 g of freeze-dried biomass (6 % of yield).

40|$|Topical microbicides are self-administered, <b>prophylactic</b> <b>products</b> for {{protection}} against sexually transmitted pathogens. A {{large number of}} compounds with known anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) inhibitory activity have been proposed as candidate topical microbicides. To identify potential leads, an in vitro screening algorithm was developed to evaluate candidate microbicides in assays that assess inhibition of cell-associated and cell-free HIV- 1 transmission, entry, and fusion. The algorithm advances compounds by evaluation {{in a series of}} defined assays that generate measurements of relative antiviral potency to determine advancement or failure. Initial testing consists of a dual determination of inhibitory activity in the CD 4 -dependent CCR 5 -tropic cell-associated transmission inhibition assay and in the CD 4 /CCR 5 -mediated HIV- 1 entry assay. The activity is confirmed by repeat testing, and identified actives are advanced to secondary screens to determine their effect on transmission of CXCR 4 -tropic viruses in {{the presence or absence of}} CD 4 and their ability to inhibit CXCR 4 - and CCR 5 -tropic envelope-mediated cell-to-cell fusion. In addition, confirmed active compounds are also evaluated in the presence of human seminal plasma, in assays incorporating a pH 4 to 7 transition, and for growth inhibition of relevant strains of lactobacilli. Leads may then be advanced for specialized testing, including determinations in human cervical explants and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells against primary HIV subtypes, combination testing with other inhibitors, and additional cytotoxicity assays. PRO 2000 and SPL 7013 (the active component of VivaGel), two microbicide products currently being evaluated in human clinical trials, were tested in this in vitro algorithm and were shown to be highly active against CCR 5 - and CXCR 4 -tropic HIV- 1 infection...|$|R
40|$|Liver {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by changes in all phases of hemostasis. These hemostatic alterations were long considered to predispose patients with liver disease towards a bleeding tendency, as they are associated with prolonged conventional coagulation tests. However, these patients may also suffer from thrombotic complications, and {{we now know that}} the hemostatic system in patient with liver disease is, in fact, in a rebalanced state. In this review we discuss the concept of rebalanced hemostasis and its implications for clinical management of patients with liver disease. For instance, {{there is no evidence that}} the use of <b>prophylactic</b> blood <b>product</b> transfusion prior to invasive procedures reduces bleeding risk. Clinicians should also be aware of the possibility of thrombosis occurring in patients with a liver disease, and regular thrombosis prophylaxis should not be withheld in these patients...|$|R

40|$|Intraoperative {{blood loss}} and {{transfusion}} of blood products are negatively associated with postoperative outcome after liver surgery. Blood loss can be minimized by surgical methods, including vascular clamping techniques, the use of dissection devices, {{and the use of}} topical hemostatic agents. Preoperative correction of coagulation tests with blood products has not been shown to reduce intraoperative bleeding and it may, in fact, enhance the bleeding risk. Maintaining a low central venous pressure {{has been shown to be}} effective in reducing blood loss during partial liver resections, and volume contraction rather than <b>prophylactic</b> transfusion blood <b>products</b> seems justified in patients undergoing major liver surgery.

40|$|Congenital factor XIII (FXIII) {{deficiency}} is {{an extremely}} rare, yet potentially life-threatening, bleeding disorder, with a 30 % rate of spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage. Routine prophylactic management is recommended for all individuals with clinically relevant (FXIII) deficiency and for all symptomatic individuals with congenital factor deficiency. Fibrogammin ® P is a purified, pasteurized concentrate of FXIII that appears to carry negligible risk of viral transmission, unlike other unprocessed products containing FXIII. An ongoing Phase II/III study of Fibrogammin ® P in patients with congenital FXIII deficiency is being conducted to evaluate the prophylactic efficacy and long-term safety of this product. Using retrospective chart review data from subjects enrolled in the Phase II/III study, the current analysis was designed to compare spontaneous bleed-event rates prior to and after the initiation of Fibrogammin ® P prophylaxis. Seven subjects were evaluable for comparison, having received no other <b>prophylactic</b> FXIII-containing <b>product</b> during the 24 [*]months prior to study entry. The mean annual number of spontaneous bleeds was 2. 5 [*]events per year prior to Fibrogammin ® P prophylaxis and 0. 2 [*]events per year during Fibrogammin ® P prophylaxis (P [*]=[*] 0. 01).

5000|$|Four {{values that}} {{represent}} clot formation {{are determined by}} this test: the reaction time (R value), the K value, the angle and the maximum amplitude (MA). The R value represents the time until the first evidence of a clot is detected. The K value is the time {{from the end of}} R until the clot reaches 20mm and this represents the speed of clot formation. The angle is the tangent of the curve made as the K is reached and offers similar information to K. The MA is a reflection of clot strength. A mathematical formula determined by the manufacturer can be used to determine a Coagulation Index (CI) (or overall assessment of coagulability) which takes into account the relative contribution of each of these 4 values into 1 equation.The G-value is a log-derivation of the MA and is meant to also represent the clot strength using dynes/sec as its units. There are some studies which suggest that an elevated G-value is associated with a hypercoagulable state and therefore increases the risk for venous thromboembolic disease. However, there are no studies dosing of <b>prophylactic</b> heparin <b>products</b> based on the G-value. TEG also measures clot lysis which is reported as both the estimated percent lysis (EPL) and the percentage of clot which has actually lysed after 30 minutes (LY 30,%). Although a normal EPL can be as high as 15% and a normal LY 30 can be has high as 8%, some studies in the trauma population suggest that a LY30 greater than 3% is associated with risk of hemorrhage.|$|R
30|$|Both {{hospitals}} had anticoagulation protocols {{and local}} guidelines for haemostatic management for patients undergoing ECMO, and these protocols were similar for VV and VA ECMO. In both centres, systemic anticoagulation with a heparin infusion targeting an activated {{partial thromboplastin time}} (aPTT) between 50 and 70  s was standard practice, unless patients were bleeding or at increased risk of bleeding (usually related to peri-operative and traumatic injuries). Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion was given to maintain a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration above 8  g/dL. <b>Prophylactic</b> blood <b>products</b> were not routinely given for coagulation abnormalities, with the exception of severe thrombocytopenia (< 50, 000 platelets/mm 3). In the case of bleeding, platelets were administered to maintain a platelet count ≥ 80, 000 /mm 3, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to maintain the international normalised ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 or prothrombin (PT) > 70  %, and cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate to maintain fibrinogen plasma concentration ≥ 1.5  g/L. Coagulation factor concentrates, antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid), antithrombin III and protamine were administered when deemed appropriate by the intensivist in charge. Heparin was the anticoagulant of choice; however, alternatives (warfarin, lepirudin) were used if necessary. ECMO circuits were phosphorylcholine and heparin bonded in both centres. Circuit membrane was changed at the Alfred Hospital if there was evidence of systemic fibrinolysis presumed to be due to circuit or clot in the oxygenator and at both sites in cases of poor oxygenator function and increases in trans-oxygenator pressure. Proton pump inhibitors were routinely administered to ECMO patients. At the Alfred Hospital, both cannulae of VA and VV ECMO were percutaneously inserted, while at Hospital of Besançon cannula of VA ECMO was surgically inserted.|$|R
40|$|This review {{represents}} a modern {{view to the}} intestinal microbiocenosis and possibilities of influence on it with the means of prebiotic food components. Status of intestinal microbiota {{is one of the}} main factors of children health. As it was shown in the recent studies, certain constancy of microbiota of every individual in many respects is determined genetically. Intestinal microflora directly influence on the formation of the child immune system, provide protection from pathogens and participates in all types of metabolism. In its turn the intestinal microbiocenosis itself depends on the status of the macroorganism and exogenous factors, with nutrition being the most significant of them. As a matter of fact, there is a combined evolution of nutrition, intestinal microbiocenosis and intestinal mucous membrane with associated to it lymphoid tissue. Supplementation of nutritive components, contributing to vegetation of the «useful» microflora, with food is an effective mechanism of «dietary manipulation» of intestinal biocenosis. Biological effects of prebiotics are discussed in detail. Oligosaccharides of the breast milk have a number of biological effects, which exceed the limits of only prebiotic action. However including of prebiotic components with proved effects into children milk formulas and porridges adds these <b>products</b> <b>prophylactic</b> and therapeutic-prophylactic characteristics. </em...|$|R
40|$|Oropharyngeal candidosis (OPC) is {{a common}} {{opportunistic}} yeast infection in elderly and immuno-compromised populations, caused by Candida albicans and other Candida spp. forming biofilms on the oral epithelium or artificial denture surfaces. Oral thrush (pseudomembranous candidosis) {{is the most common}} type of OPC occurring when a biofilm grows on oral mucosal surfaces, while growth on dentures commonly causes denture stomatitis in denture-wearers. OPC causes significant morbidity with symptoms including inflammation, pain, burning, eating difficulties and alteration of taste sensation. Conventional antifungal treatments have limited success due to biofilm resistance mechanisms, with recurring infections promoting development of azole resistance. Other problems with current antifungal drugs include toxicity, drug interactions and unpleasant taste. Therefore, alternative methods for prophylactic or therapeutic management of Candida spp. biofilms are desirable. This study aimed firstly to evaluate the efficacy of tea tree oil (TTO) and its derivatives against biofilms formed by a clinically-diverse panel of C. albicans isolates; and secondly to assess the toxicological effects of TTO exposure using a clinically relevant oral cell line. Thirdly, this study aimed to further investigate previously reported anti-inflammatory effects of TTO. TTO is a complex mixture of essential oils; however, individual components of TTO are commercially available. TTO has broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and TTO oral products are currently available. However, evidence for antifungal efficacy is limited and there are concerns regarding safety of long-term use of TTO products. The data presented demonstrate TTO and its derivatives are effective antifungal agents. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of TTO and seven components were determined for planktonic C. albicans cells (PMIC) using the standard CLSI dilution technique. The PMIC 50 value for TTO was 0. 5 %, with lower values for two components - 0. 25 % for both terpinen- 4 -ol (T 4 -ol) and α-terpineol. Growth of all 100 strains was inhibited by 1 % TTO, 0. 5 % terpinen- 4 -ol and 0. 5 % α-terpineol. A pilot study found no decrease in TTO sensitivity with multiple TTO exposure. Sessile susceptibilities (SMFC) were determined using a metabolic assay on C. albicans cells after 24 h treatment of pre-formed biofilms, to determine the most effective anti-biofilm components. T 4 -ol and α-terpineol were potent biofilm inhibitors, which could inhibit biofilm metabolism by 50 % at PMIC 50 concentrations (SMFC 50 = 0. 25 %), exhibiting significantly greater anti-biofilm activity than TTO (SMFC 50 = 1 %). Strains isolated from different patient groups had similar biofilm susceptibilities. Other components tested had little effect on biofilm metabolism (SMFC 50 of 2 % to > 4 %). Shorter treatments modelling a ‘mouthwash’ exposure time produced moderate inhibition (50 %) of pre-formed biofilm metabolism after 2 min in 1 % α-terpineol, while longer exposures with 1 % T 4 -ol (15 min) and 2 % TTO (60 min) were required to give this level of inhibition. A time-dependent treatment effect for TTO and the single components was also seen at these concentrations, with longer exposures giving better inhibition of biofilm metabolism. Inhibition of biofilm formation and morphogenesis was also investigated to define effective components, concentrations and exposure times for prophylactic use. Presence of TTO, T 4 -ol or α-terpineol could prevent morphogenesis of C. albicans, and therefore block biofilm formation, if present within 2 hours of adherence of cells to a surface. One hour treatments with PMIC 50 levels of TTO (0. 5 %) or the 2 components (0. 25 %) could effectively prevent biofilm formation. Pre-coating a plastic well with 1 % TTO prior to inoculation resulted in strong inhibition (> 50 %) of biofilm formation. Cellular cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that antifungal concentrations of TTO and T 4 -ol were cytotoxic to human cells in vitro. Investigations using a human oral epithelial cell line (OKF 6 -TERT 2) and primary oral fibroblasts indicated that 2 min exposures to TTO and T 4 -ol showed cytotoxic effects at 0. 25 %, comparable with 0. 12 % chlorhexidine, with 0. 125 % TTO / T 4 -ol being non-toxic. Previously reported immunomodulatory effects were investigated using non-toxic concentrations of TTO / T 4 -ol (0. 125 %). The cytokine response of oral epithelial cells following TTO / T 4 -ol treatment was monitored using quantitative PCR, protein arrays and an IL- 8 ELISA. TTO did not exhibit any clear immunomodulatory effects, but T 4 -ol pre-treatment of zymosan-activated cells resulted in reduced IL- 8 protein in ELISA assays, indicating a potential to reduce inflammation. Although inflammation is a major symptom of OPC infections, it is also an important part of the host response to control the yeast pathogen. An anti-inflammatory agent may help to control candidosis symptoms, but may cause problems in controlling the infection. These studies demonstrate that T 4 -ol could be suitable for use in <b>prophylactic</b> oral hygiene <b>products</b> such as mouthrinses and denture cleansers, and also as a novel treatment for established OPC infections. The use of T 4 -ol, a single component from TTO, has advantages over the complete essential oil in terms of product safety and consistency. Preclinical and clinical trials of mouthwashes or denture cleansers, containing the range of T 4 -ol concentrations (0. 125 - 0. 5 %) investigated in these studies, would be required to validate the clinical use of such a product. In conclusion, TTO-derived mouthwashes and denture cleansers may offer both a suitable alternative to conventional azole treatment of OPC and also a safe prophylactic alternative for inhibiting microbial biofilms, as they exhibit potent antifungal activity...|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobial growth {{promoters}} (AGPs) are substances that {{are added to}} feed in sub-therapeutic levels in intensive animal production to improve weight gain and conversion of feed (FCR) into body mass. AGPs have been used widely as {{growth promoters}} in broiler and pig production under high-density growth conditions. Despite the observed efficacy, the use of AGPs has been criticized due to its possible {{role in the development}} of antibiotic resistance in human pathogens. Directive 183 / 2003 of the European Parliament, issued in 2003, banned of the use of all antibiotic agents as growth promoters in the European Union from 2006. The new context caused an increase in the search for alternative growth promoters. The aim of this study was to produce a commercially viable <b>prophylactic</b> antibacterial phytogenic <b>product</b> from Ginkgo biloba and Hypericum perforatum with a low potential to develop resistance, as an alternative to AGPs in poultry production. The first objective of this study based on earlier results of the Phytomedicine Programme, was to evaluate the activity and potentize extracts from Ginkgo biloba and Hypericum perforatum for optimal activity against relevant bacterial pathogens. Extracts of ethyl acetate (EA), hexane, dichloromethane (DCM) and acetone (in order of activity) from a direct extraction procedure of powdered G. biloba leaves were active against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens. The EA, hexane and DCM extracts were 2 to 3 times more active than the acetone extract (average total activity 1728 ml/g dry extract for the 3 pathogens). The DCM-, EA-, acetone- and hexane extracts (in order of activity) from the direct extraction procedure from H. perforatum were only active against C. perfringens with the first three extracts having a total activity of between 1026 and 1333 ml/g dry material and the hexane extract a total activity of 333 ml/g dry material. The spectrum of activity of G. biloba corresponds to that of Zn-bacitracin, which is commonly used an antibiotic growth promoter in the poultry industry. The second objective in this study was to combine extracts or fractions of extracts of G. biloba and H. perforatum to optimise activity against selected bacterial pathogens. A synergistic effect could be observed when combining a ratio of 1 : 5 of G. biloba: H. perforatum (hexane extracts) or 1 : 15 (acetone extracts) against E. faecalis while only an indifferent (neutral) effect was observed against C. perfringens. After elucidation of the quantitative and qualitative aspects involved in the antimicrobial activity, the major antibacterial compound from G. biloba was isolated and characterized as ginkgolic acid (C 17 : 1). It was also determined whether activity against E. faecalis and C. perfringens in an extract or fraction of and extract of G. biloba can be attributed only to ginkgolic acid or whether synergism or other interactions also play a role in the antibacterial activity. It was shown that synergistic interactions are at play between constituents in the hexane and EA fraction, with the last mentioned fraction not containing any ginkgolic acid. These results support the use of the whole extract as opposed to isolated compounds as antimicrobial agents against pathogenic organisms. Two important pharmacodynamic parameters were investigated i. e. resistance development to a hexane extract and the isolated ginkgolic acid from G. biloba against E. faecalis and secondly the time-kill dynamics of this hexane extract over 24 h against E. faecalis. The bactericidal nature of the hexane extract from G. biloba as well the absence of decreased susceptibility to this extract (and the isolated ginkgolic acid) in the resistance studies against E. faecalis indicate that this extract has potential to be exploited as a alternative to AGPs in the poultry industry. The final objective was to determine the effect of extracts of G. biloba alone or in combination with H. perforatum extracts on the performance of broiler chickens over a 35 day period. The effect of these extracts on C. perfringens in the intestine of broilers was also investigated. No significant differences were found with relation to any of the production parameters studied (FCR, live weight or % survival) although a trend towards more favourable European Performance Efficiency Factor index values were observed for treatments containing G. biloba (5 % improvement) or a combination of G. biloba and H. perforatum (2. 1 % improvement) compared to the untreated control. Similarly, Zn-Bacitracin resulted in a 5. 5 % improvement compared to the untreated control. There was a general trend (not statistically significant, P= 0. 05) towards a reduction in C. perfringens scores in the feed supplemented with G. biloba- in combination with H. perforatum extract which can probably be ascribed to the direct antimicrobial effect. The rate of colonization was however too low to cause infection probably due to lack of virulence of the C. perfringens challenge and the absence of predisposing factors due to the hygienic growth conditions used. It is necessary for an effective disease model to be developed in order for the efficacy of any new treatment method to be properly evaluated. Such a model will require a much higher incidence of disease and reproducibility than was achieved in this project. The safety of using extracts of G. biloba with ginkgolic acid as the prime antibacterial compound was considered. The active dose was at least 42 times lower than safe dosage recommended in the literature. The combination of extracts of G. biloba and H. perforatum holds promise as a potential growth promoter in poultry production. Better results may be achieved if potentized extracts are used and compared with Zn-Bacitracin and a negative control under industrial growth conditions where the birds are stressed and natural infections would take place.
