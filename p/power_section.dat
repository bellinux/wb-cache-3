5|$|During the investigation, the Royal Navy {{conducted}} recovery operations. The first {{pieces of}} wreckage were discovered on 12 February 1954 {{and the search}} continued until September 1954, by which time 70 percent by weight of the main structure, 80 percent of the <b>power</b> <b>section,</b> and 50 percent of the aircraft's systems and equipment had been recovered. The forensic reconstruction effort had just begun when the Abell Committee reported its findings. No apparent fault in the aircraft was found, and the British government decided against opening a further public inquiry into the accident. The prestigious nature of the Comet project, particularly for the British aerospace industry, and the financial impact of the aircraft's grounding on BOAC's operations, both served to pressure the inquiry to end without further investigation. Comet flights resumed on 23 March 1954.|$|E
25|$|The Competition and Consumer Act (CCA) {{is an act}} of the Parliament of Australia and so its {{application}} is limited by section 51 of the Australian Constitution, which sets out the division of powers between the federal and state parliaments. As a result, most of the CCA is drafted to apply only to corporations, thus relying on Section 51(xx). Some parts of the CCA have a broader operation, relying for instance on the telecommunications <b>power</b> (<b>Section</b> 51(v)) or the territories power.|$|E

2500|$|The AAP Case in 1975 [...] {{examined}} {{the nature of}} the appropriations power (Constitution section 81) and the incidental <b>power</b> (<b>section</b> 51(xxxix)). The Appropriation Act (Number 1) provided for certain sums to be appropriated to the Australian Assistance Plan to enable grants to be made to Regional Councils for Social Development. The Victorian Government disputed the powers of the Commonwealth to legislate for such purposes. In his dissenting judgement, Justice Gibbs held that the words of Section 61 [...] "make it clear that the Executive cannot act in respect of a matter which falls entirely outside the legislative competence of the Commonwealth".|$|E
2500|$|The Howard Government {{sought to}} bring as many {{employees}} under WorkChoices as was within its constitutional powers. It {{relied on the}} corporations <b>power</b> (<b>Section</b> 51(xx) of the Constitution) extending its coverage to an estimated 85% of Australian employees. All employees of [...] "constitutional corporations" [...] (i.e. trading, financial, and foreign corporations) became covered by the WorkChoices system. Other constitutional powers used {{by the federal government}} to extend the scope of the legislation included the [...] to cover the Australian territories, including the external territories of the Christmas and Cocos Islands, the external affairs power, the interstate and overseas trade and commerce power, and the powers of the Commonwealth to legislate for its own employees. Victoria voluntarily had referred its industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth in 1996, under section 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution.|$|E
2500|$|The {{right to}} vote may be limited under section 25 on racial grounds as anyone disqualified from voting on racial grounds at a State level was {{automatically}} excluded at the Federal level. [...] It {{was intended as a}} penalty against any state which excluded voters {{on the basis of race}} as it would consequently have its federal representation reduced. [...] However, as George Williams has argued, it recognises that race-based disqualification is possible, which is antithetical to true equality between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. [...] The removal of this section is one of the changes needed to prevent lawful race-based discrimination against the Aboriginal peoples, and is one of the recommendations of the Expert Panel on Recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples in the Constitution. [...] They also recommended deletion of the race <b>power</b> (<b>section</b> 51(xxvi)) and the addition of new provisions prohibiting any race-based discrimination, suggestions that have found support in the legal fraternity.|$|E

The gas generator consists of the compressor, combustion chambers with ignitors and fuel nozzles, and one or more stages of turbine. The <b>power</b> <b>section</b> consists of additional stages of turbines, a gear reduction system, and the shaft output. The gas generator creates the hot expanding gases to drive the <b>power</b> <b>section.</b> Depending on the design, the engine accessories may be driven either by the gas generator or by the <b>power</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E

50|$|Testing of the XT40 {{began on}} 4 June 1948, {{revealing}} some major vibration problems from the reduction gearbox due to mis-matched noise frequencies caused by poorly designed gear teeth. The de-coupling system, designed to disconnect a <b>power</b> <b>section</b> {{in the event}} of failure worked successfully. During a run in a test cell one <b>power</b> <b>section</b> developed a major oil leak and an attempt to shut it down failed because the engine carried on running on the leaking oil. After many attempts to shut it down the offending <b>power</b> <b>section</b> could only be shut down by destroying the compressor with buckets of nuts and bolts thrown down the intake, proving the de-coupling system.|$|E

The causal reduction of consciousness – the causal explicability of its features by brain processes and {{the identity of}} its causal <b>powers</b> (<b>section</b> 2) – is incompatible with ontological irreducibility (section 3), because the ontological difference between subjective and objective features make the identity of causal <b>powers</b> incomprehensible (<b>section</b> 4).
