50|$|William McGuire {{was one of}} {{the first}} to develop the Yale model during the late 1960s; interestingly, McGuire is best known for his {{inoculation}} theory of creating resistance to persuasion. McGuire emphasized the importance of reception (the attention and comprehension stages of the Yale group) and yielding (anticipation and critical-evaluation steps) in his study of individual differences in influencibility. He predicted that ability and motivational attributes would be positively related to reception. Another description of McGuire's <b>persuasion</b> <b>process</b> is six steps: presentation, attention, comprehension, yielding, retention and behavior. For example, people with high intelligence have the cognitive skills to comprehend the speaker’s message. Similarly, people with high self-esteem are more socially engaged and less anxious or distracted, facilitating attention to (and comprehension of) the message. McGuire found that yielding to persuasion required the opposite attributes; people with low intelligence and self-esteem are more likely to change their opinion after receiving a message. People with midrange intelligence and self-esteem seemed to be the most-easily persuaded, since they were most likely to receive and yield to the message.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{exponential}} growth in internet usage for personal communication {{over the last}} 10 years (Madden & Zickuhr, 2011) little is known of the online interpersonal <b>persuasion</b> <b>process.</b> Whilst some psychological research has been undertaken in this area, the findings are somewhat contradictory (e. g. Di Blasio & Milani, 2008; Murphy, Long, Hoileran, & Esterly, 2003). These studies also fail to give consideration to cues used in online persuasive interactions due {{to the absence of}} paralinguistic cues. Further, the extant research in this domain has not explicitly examined the <b>persuasion</b> <b>process</b> in terms of a theoretical model. This thesis aims to address these issues and provide a foundation from which future research can be based. This thesis comprises two studies. The first study examined participants' reactions to anonymous persuasive requests. These requests were presented using three situational contexts, each of which elicited different self-interest rnotivations (i. e. social, learning, and political). It also compared participants' reactions to these contexts across three different communication modes both online and offline (i. e. instant messaging, email, and face to face). Language cues (i. e. language power and emotion) contained in the messages presented were also manipulated. The findings from this study show that in anonymous interactions communication mode does not affect compliance decisions. Instead, individuals are sensitive to situational context in online interactions and they process information in accordance with their self-interest motivations. Further, it was also found that, despite the anonymity, individuals are able to engage in impression formation by using the available cues and utilise these impressions when making compliance decisions. In response to these findings, Study 2 examined the effect of prior information in online interpersonal persuasive interactions and found that this information influences message evaluations over and above those in anonymous interactions. This study also examined the <b>persuasion</b> <b>process</b> in terms of a theoretical model finding that individuals engage in hypothesistesting utilising all the information they perceive to be relevant to a compliance decision. Thus, it was concluded that Kruglanski and Thompson's (1999) unimodel of persuasion provides the best explanation for online interpersonal persuasion processes. The findings from this thesis provide a broad foundation from which to base future research. They demonstrate that context is important in online communication and affects compliance decisions. They also show that cues are attended to in on line interactions and are used in the evaluation process as they provide relevant evidence from which to base a compliance decision.

50|$|The first {{efforts to}} justify the effect were {{consistent}} with the understanding of <b>persuasion</b> <b>processes</b> at that time. Hovland and his colleagues introduced a program of research to study how recall of the message and the source persuaded the sleeper effect. They first hypothesized that message receivers forget the noncredible communicator as time goes by, and therefore the initial message rejection diminishes. Nevertheless, they later propositioned that message receivers may not entirely forget the cue, yet the association between the representations of the discounting cue and the message content may fade over time and produce a sleeper effect. These two formulations vary in that (a) forgetting suggests that the traces of the cue disappear or become unavailable in memory over time, while (b) dissociation suggests that cue remains available in memory but is simply less easily retrieved (less accessible) in relation to the topic of communication.|$|R

Empirical evidence shows that there are significant differences in perceived satisfaction, credibility and behavioural intention between the users who surf the non-persuasive website and the users who surf the persuasive website.

The data show that the attitudes of older adults are more strongly affected by an easy-to-process criterion, picture-relatedness, at their non-optimal time of day (afternoon) and by a more-difficult-to-process criterion, argument strength, at their optimal time of day (morning). In contrast, the attitudes of younger adults are affected primarily by argument strength at both their optimal (after-noon) and non-optimal (morning) times of day.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} extent to which differences in perceived diagnosticity as compared with differences in the accessibility of associations embedded in persuasion appeals better account for the attitudinal differences found in the culture and persuasion literature. Experiment 1 replicates basic findings showing that high culture-distinct associations lead to more favorable attitudes for individuals in the target culture relative to a nontarget culture, while low culture-distinct associations lead to more attitudinal similarities across cultural boundaries. Experiments 2 and 3 explore two potential explanations for these effects. Convergent evidence, provided through within-culture and across-culture mediation analysis, is more supportive of the differential accessibility explanation. That is, high culture-distinct associations may be valued in the nontarget culture but are relatively inaccessible in memory at an individual level. The results of these experiments help to reconcile conflicting findings in the consumer psychology literature, shed insight on why cultural differences might occur, and add to the growing body of research that identifies conditions under which cultural similarities in <b>persuasion</b> <b>processes</b> and effects may be found. ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years, sport {{sponsorship}} {{has become a}} privileged tool for companies willing to add an extra bit of soul to their communication. In the meantime, a considerable body of academic knowledge has been produced to allow {{a better understanding of}} the <b>persuasion</b> <b>process</b> happening in a sponsorship context. Despite being described as a fundamentally affective <b>persuasion</b> <b>process</b> (Quester, 1996), most of the knowledge accumulated so far about sponsorship has mobilised a cognitive perspective. Notwithstanding the contribution of cognitions in explaining sponsorship outcomes, we suggest that a purely cognitive approach of sponsorship fails to consider what determine both the nature of the message and the context in which it is received: i. e. the emotions elicited by sports drama. A multi-disciplinary literature review (sponsorship, persuasion theory, psychology, neurosciences) helped us proposing an affective model of persuasion for sport sponsorship, placing spectators’ emotional reactions at the heart of the communication. We tested this model at two similar tennis events – Roland Garros (n = 437) and the Australian Open (n = 375) – for eight sponsors. Data supports the hypothesised universality of emotional reactions amongst spectators of sporting events. Data also support that the dimensions of emotional intensity and valence affect cognitive (sponsors recognition), attitudinal (attitude toward the event, attitude toward the sponsor) and behavioural (purchase intent) outcomes of sponsorship. Finally, data supports the centrality of the concept of attitude toward the event in our affective model of persuasion. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, Business School, 201...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} decade of the new millennium, {{children}} and adolescents' commercial media environment has changed dramatically. Advertisers have rapidly adopted new advertising techniques including branded websites, brand placement in video games, and viral marketing in social media (Buijzen et al., 2010; Calvert, 2008). Those new practices are fundamentally different from traditional advertising. Notably, non-traditional advertising practices typically rely on affect-based mechanisms and are often embedded within program or editorial content (Calvert, 2008; Wright et al., 2005), which may have important consequences for young people's understanding and processing of advertising. Importantly, the affect-based and integrated commercial media environment poses new challenges for young people's advertising literacy (currently conceptualized as advertising-related knowledge and understanding). For example, when a commercial message is embedded within an "advergame" - an advertiser-sponsored online game – children may be less ready to process the message critically, and to resist its persuasive appeal (Owen et al., 2013). In this chapter, we review the state of the art of the international research literature on young people and persuasion, focusing specifically on today’s commercial media environment.

40|$|Activist groups {{increasingly}} use computer-mediated communication (CMC) {{channels to}} mobilize {{large groups of}} consumers to persuade incumbent firms to change their contested strategies or practices. The attributes of CMC channels change the effectiveness of <b>persuasion</b> <b>processes</b> in organizations. Similarly, attributes may change the effectiveness of protest mobilization. Yet, organizational research to date has mostly neglected this potential effect. This paper systematically reviews the effect of CMC attributes on the antecedents of protest participation. We construct a conceptual framework based on social movement and media choice theory, which guides the systematic collation of online activism research. Three main themes emerge from the literature. First, {{we find that the}} interactivity of online activism decreases the need for formal mobilizing structures, while increasing the importance of informal mobilizing structures for protest diffusion and global cooperation between activist groups. Second, increased interactivity and user control provide an alternative media channel for consumers and resource-poor activist groups to express and bundle their grievances. Third, the degree of publicness and interactivity seems to stimulate the formation of multiple, online collective identities that are rather interest-based than identity-based.
