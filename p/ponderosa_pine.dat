5|$|Spokane {{is within}} the Northern/Canadian Rockies ecoregion, which {{supports}} an abundance of wildlife {{in part because of}} its varied geology and natural history. The area contains a wide range of vegetation, from densely wooded coniferous forests to rolling grassy hills and meadows. <b>Ponderosa</b> <b>pine</b> and Douglas fir are common in the drier and lower elevation areas throughout the region. The <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pine</b> is the official tree of the City of Spokane, which is where specimens were first collected by botanist David Douglas in 1826.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{elevation}} forests contain whitebark pine, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and limber pine, including the largest individual whitebark pine in North America. Based on tree ring chronologies, {{some of the}} whitebark pines {{are believed to be}} 700 to 1000 or more years old. The {{highest elevation}} forests typically have understories of grasses and forbs that are resistant to freezing at any point of the growing season. Willows, alders, cottonwoods, and sedges are found in riparian areas. <b>Ponderosa</b> <b>pine</b> occupy the dry, lower elevations near {{the western edge of the}} forest and historically persisted due to the occurrence of frequent non-lethal fires. <b>Ponderosa</b> <b>pine</b> forest understories typically consist of perennial grasses such as Idaho fescue and bluebunch wheatgrass. In the slightly moister <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pine</b> forests grasses such as pinegrass are found with a cover of shrubs including white spirea, common snowberry, and mallow ninebark.|$|E
5|$|The Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park {{contains}} {{a wide variety}} of flora and fauna. Some common plants native to the park include aspen, <b>Ponderosa</b> <b>pine,</b> sagebrush, desert mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius), Utah juniper, gambel oak (scrub oak) and single-leaf ash. The Black Canyon gilia (Aliciella penstemonoides) is a species of wildflower native to the park.|$|E

5|$|Cyptotrama asprata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and grows}} on the decaying wood of deciduous and coniferous trees. Host species include white fir (Abies concolor), sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and other maple (Acer) species, grey alder (Alnus oblongifolia), beech (Fagus) species, spruce (Picea) species, <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus ponderosa) and other pine (Pinus) species, poplar (Populus) and oak (Quercus) species. In temperate North America, specimens are typically collected between July through September.|$|E
5|$|The Cascade Range is {{dramatically}} different in climate from west to east. The west side is heavily forested and features trees such as Douglas firs, western hemlock, Pacific silver firs, and Alaska yellow cedars. East of the Cascades, where Yamsay lies, the climate becomes much drier, even arid. Precipitation significantly declines and vegetation becomes more sparse, with lodgepole pine, white fir, <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pine,</b> and juniper. To the south, chaparral {{plants such as}} beargrass and bitterbrush prevail.|$|E
5|$|A {{grove of}} {{enormous}} incense cedars exists near Diamond Lake, {{and there is}} a forest of <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pine</b> at the nearby Emile Big Tree Trail. The Umpqua National Forest features swordferns and Douglas firs. Rocky Mountain elks, pronghorns, and mule deer, bobcats, black bears, and mountain lions live in the Fremont–Winema National Forest. The forest's rivers support populations of trout, and the lakes contain fish such as the largemouth bass. The forest is inhabited by avian species such as mallards, American bald eagles, Canada geese, and whistling swans. Peregrine falcons and Warner suckers also infrequently enter its boundaries.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} and field experiments {{were conducted to}} determine if mature <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pines</b> produce a substance (phytotoxin) that inhibits the germination and growth of seedlings directly under the tree crown. Neither live nor dead materials collected from <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pines</b> produced either volatile or water-soluble phytotoxins that drastically inhibited germination of seeds or growth of seedlings. Seed overwintering beneath the canopy of mature pine, or planted in soils collected there, showed reduced germination. Exact cause of the reduction was not determined. If weak phytotoxins were responsible, they did not inhibit growth of seedlings that germinated...|$|R
5|$|Fire {{suppression}} {{encouraged the}} growth of young coniferous trees, such as <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pine</b> and incense cedar; adult conifers create enough shade to inhibit {{the growth of}} young black oak trees. By the 20thcentury, fire suppression and the lowering of water tables by draining swamps led {{to the establishment of}} dense conifer forests where mixed and open conifer-oak woodlands had previously grown. Fire suppression polices have been replaced by a fire management program which includes the annual use of prescribed fires. Fire is especially important to the giant sequoia groves, whose seeds cannot germinate without fire-touched soil.|$|E
5|$|Native {{riparian}} {{plant life}} includes sandbar willows and cottonwoods with Montana's state tree, the <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pine,</b> also being prevalent. Other native plants include wetland {{species such as}} cattails and beaked-sedge as well as shrubs and berry plants like Douglas hawthorn, chokecherry, and western snowberries. To the chagrin of local farmers, Missoula {{is also home to}} several noxious weeds, which multiple programs have set out to eliminate. Notable ones include Dalmatian toadflax, spotted knapweed, leafy spurge, St. John's wort, and sulfur cinquefoil. Controversially, the Norway maples that line many of Missoula's older streets have also been declared an invasive species.|$|E
5|$|Oak savanna {{is a type}} of {{grassland}} with scattered oak trees, {{found on}} the lowest slopes of the Table Rocks. The Takelma tribe often set fires in the oak savanna and chaparral regions to prevent brush overgrowth, creating foraging areas for animals such as deer and elk. It also prevented large wildfires. Oregon white oak and <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pine</b> are the most common trees found in the region. Buckbrush, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, Pacific madrone, deerbrush, birchleaf mountain mahogany, and Pacific poison oak are also common.|$|E
50|$|Later, {{the tornado}} crossed U.S. Route 441 and reached its maximum {{intensity}} as it struck the <b>Ponderosa</b> <b>Pines</b> RV park. In the RV park, at least 10 people died {{and almost all}} of the 200 residences, including both RVs and mobile homes, were destroyed. Many of these residences had their frames thrown, stripped, and wrapped around trees. Many trees were snapped and uprooted as well. Nearby, the Morningside Acres mobile home park was devastated as well. Upon leaving the <b>Ponderosa</b> <b>Pines</b> and Morningside areas, the tornado heavily damaged homes next to a school in the Lakeside Estates subdivision of Buenaventura Lakes.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{debates over}} post-fire logging {{practices}} and their impacts have highlighted {{the need for}} a greater understanding of snag dynamics and the relative importance of snags as potential wildlife habitat and as the source of future fuels that influence the severity of subsequent wildfires. This debate is especially relevant in fire-prone dry coniferous forests, where fire exclusion has often altered forest structure and fuel loadings and increased the incidence of stand-replacing wildfires. To address these issues, we sampled fire-killed trees at 126 sites within a chronosequence of 49 wildfires that burned dry coniferous forests of eastern Washington and Oregon from 1970 - 2007. We sampled a total of 6851 fire-killed trees, recording their species, diameter, and status. Logistic regression analysis showed that snag fall rates varied by species and size. Snag retention times increased with tree diameter. For any given size class, <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pines</b> fell more rapidly than true firs (Abies spp) and Douglas-firs. More than half of small <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pines</b> (3 ̆c 30 cm dbh) fell within 10 years after wildfire. Fire-killed <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pines</b> had at least a 50...|$|R
5|$|The {{watershed}} {{is covered}} predominantly by temperate coniferous forest, which makes up approximately 64 {{percent of the}} total area. The primary species in these areas are Douglas-fir, <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pine,</b> madrone, and incense-cedar. Buckbrush and manzanita grow in the drier chaparral regions. Several rare plants including Gentner's fritillary, oblongleaf stonecrop, Siskiyou lewisia, clustered lady's slipper, and splithair Indian paintbrush also grow in the watershed. Seven species of noxious weeds have been identified: three species of thistles, medusahead rye, Scotch broom, St. Johns wort, and tansy ragwort.|$|E
5|$|Along much of Yosemite's western boundary, {{habitats}} {{are dominated}} by mixed coniferous forests of <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pine,</b> sugar pine, incense cedar, white fir, Douglas fir, and a few stands of giant sequoia, interspersed by areas of black oak and canyon live oak. A relatively high diversity of wildlife species is supported by these habitats, because of relatively mild, lower-elevation climate and the mixture of habitat types and plant species. Wildlife species typically found in these habitats include black bear, coyote, raccoon, mountain kingsnake, Gilbert's skink, white-headed woodpecker, bobcat, river otter, gray fox, red fox, brown creeper, two species of skunk, cougar, spotted owl, and {{a wide variety of}} bat species.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{communities}} {{within the}} park vary with elevation. The TMD has two distinct communities, desert scrub—such as fourwing saltbush and brittlebrush—at the lowest elevations and desert grassland a little higher. The RMD includes these two communities as well as four more at higher elevations, oak woodland, pine–oak woodland, pine forest and, high in the Rincons, mixed conifer forest—Douglas-fir, <b>Ponderosa</b> <b>pine,</b> white fir, Gambel oak, and many other trees, shrubs, and understory plants. During annual inventories in 2011 and 2013, hundreds of scientists and thousands of volunteers identified 389 species of vascular plants, 25 of non-vascular plants, and 197 species of fungi in Saguaro National Park.|$|E
50|$|The {{area was}} logged {{extensively}} from 1878 until the mid-1890s by the Madera Flume and Trading Company. They logged mostly sugar <b>pines,</b> <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pines,</b> white firs, and incense-cedars, {{but they did}} cut {{down some of the}} sequoias as well.|$|R

5|$|Nearly 78 {{percent of}} the {{estimated}} 26,000 trees harvested for use at Chetro Ketl were felled between 1030 and 1060. More than 7,000 trees were felled for kiva (round room) construction alone, with approximately 750 used in the great kiva. Roofs typically consisted of primary beams, secondary beams, {{and one or two}} layers of split shakes, probably of a juniper species or pinyon pine, which were locally available. Most of the primary and secondary construction beams were of <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pine.</b> In addition to bulk materials, construction required other items in smaller quantities. Cordage was used for lashing roof elements together, and baskets and wood frames were needed for transporting mortar and rock. Other tools, such as digging sticks and hammerstones, were used in quantity; many discarded hammerstones have been found built into the wall interiors.|$|E
5|$|Suillus brevipes is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, and {{it develops}} a close symbiotic {{association with the}} roots of various tree species, especially pine. The underground mycelia form a sheath around the tree rootlets, and the fungal hyphae penetrate between the cortical cells of the root, forming ectomycorrhizae. In this way, the fungus can supply the tree with minerals, while the tree reciprocates by supplying carbohydrates created by photosynthesis. In nature, it associates with two- and three-needle pines, especially lodgepole and <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pine.</b> Under controlled laboratory conditions, the fungus {{has been shown to}} form ectomycorrhizae with ponderosa, lodgepole, loblolly, eastern white, patula, pond, radiata, and red pines. In vitro mycorrhizal associations formed with non-pine species include Pacific madrone, bearberry, western larch, Sitka spruce, and coast Douglas-fir. Fungal growth is inhibited by the presence of high levels of the heavy metals cadmium (350ppm), lead (200ppm), and nickel (20ppm).|$|E
5|$|The Snake River {{watershed}} {{includes a}} diversity of vegetation zones both past and present. A majority of the watershed was once covered with shrub-steppe grassland, most common in the Snake River Plain and also the Columbia Plateau in southeastern Washington. Riparian zones, wetlands and marshes once occurred {{along the length of}} the Snake River and its tributaries. In higher elevations, conifer forests, of which <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pine</b> is most common, dominate the landscape. The basin ranges from semi-desert to alpine climates, providing habitat for hundreds of species of plants. In the lowermost part of the watershed, in southeastern Washington, the Snake River is surrounded by an area called the Columbia Plateau Ecoprovince, which is now mostly occupied by irrigated farms. The rest of the Plateau area is characterized by low hills, dry lakes, and an arid, nearly desert climate.|$|E

5|$|Morchella frustrata fruit bodies grow solitary, scattered, or {{in small}} groups in spring, in mountainous forests and maquis. The exact trophic status of the fungus is not yet known with certainty, but it is {{suspected}} to be fucaltitive mycorrhizal or biotrophic. Tree species associated with the fungus include pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), oaks (Quercus spp.), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus ponderosa), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), and white fir (Abies concolor). In Europe it is often found with holm oak (Quercus ilex), strawberry trees (Arbutus andrachne), olive trees (Olea europaea), Spanish fir (Abies pinsapo), Silver fir (Abies alba) and Scot's pine (Pinus sylvestris). Although it was originally hypothesized that collections of M. frustrata from Turkey might have been recently introduced from North America, numerous collections reported since from remote and undisturbed areas in the Mediterranean and the Alps (including Bresadola's original collection from Trentino), suggest a long-time and well-established presence of this species in Europe. Kuo suggests {{that it might be}} also widely distributed in western North America, but so far has only been confirmed to be present in Oregon and California.|$|E
5|$|Roxy Ann Peak's high {{biodiversity}} {{is due to}} {{its wide}} range of elevations and its location between the Cascade, Klamath, and Eastern Cascade ecoregions. The lower slopes of the peak support chaparral, oak savanna, and open grassland. Scattered California black oak, Oregon white oak, and Pacific madrone trees grow in these areas, as do sclerophyllous shrubs such as birchleaf mountain mahogany, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, buckbrush, antelope bitterbrush, and Pacific poison oak. Common grasses include blue wildrye and prairie Junegrass. Wildflowers including Southern Oregon buttercup, common yarrow, and Tolmie star-tulip also grow in these regions. At higher elevations, the vegetation transitions to mixed coniferous forest, dominated by Douglas fir, <b>ponderosa</b> <b>pine,</b> incense cedar, western juniper, and Pacific madrone trees. Shrubs such as common snowberry, bearbrush, greenleaf manzanita, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, deerbrush, and Pacific poison oak make up the understory of the forest, along with herbaceous plants such as creeping snowberry and Idaho fescue.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius alnicola is an ectomycorrhizal species, and {{engages in}} a mutualistic {{association}} with certain plant species. In this association, the hyphae of the fungus permeate {{large volumes of}} soil and obtain scarce elements, especially phosphorus—which is often limiting for plant growth—which they pass on to the plant in exchange for metabolic products of the plant's photosynthesis. The ectomycorrhizae that the fungus forms in association with Picea engelmannii {{have been shown to}} contain lactifers (latex-producing cells) and pigments similar to the fruit body. Fruit bodies of the fungus grow in groups on the ground under alders and conifers, usually appearing between July and October. It is a fairly common species in the western United States and Baja California. Additional collection locations in Mexico include Veracruz, Villarreal, and Tapia. A population in central and southern California is known to associate with oak trees. In the Rocky Mountains it is associated with the subalpine tree species Englemann Spruce (Picea engelmannii), while at lower elevations it is commonly found with white spruce (Picea glauca). It is also known to associate with <b>Ponderosa</b> <b>Pine</b> (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (genus Pseudotsuga). The mushroom has also been collected from Bageshwar, in the state of Uttarakhand, India.|$|E
