However, the predictive validity of the SAT has been shown to depend on the dominant ethnic and racial composition of the college. Some studies have also shown that African American students under-perform in college relative to their white peers with the same SAT scores; researchers have argued that this is likely because white students tend to benefit from social advantages outside of the educational environment (for example, high <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> their education, inclusion in campus academic activities, positive bias from same-race teachers and peers) which result in better grades.|$|E
500|$|Trimmer's fundamentalism, Grenby argues, {{does not}} {{necessarily}} mark her as a rigid thinker. Grenby points out that Trimmer, like Rousseau, believed children were naturally good. In this view, she was arguing against centuries of tradition, particularly Puritanical attitudes towards raising children (exemplified in the doctrine of original sin). Although she attacked Rousseau's works, Grenby argues that she agreed with [...] "Rousseau's key idea, later {{taken up by the}} Romantics, that children should not be forced to become adults too early", in particular that they should not be exposed to political issues too soon. Trimmer also maintained that mothers and fathers should share the responsibility of caring for the family. Like the progressive educational reformers and children's authors Maria Edgeworth and Thomas Day and even Rousseau himself, Trimmer opposed rote learning and advocated flexible and conversational lessons that encouraged critical thinking in children. She also promoted breastfeeding (a controversial position at the time) and <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> childhood education.|$|E

She also criticized its [...] "abrupt" [...] postwar ending. James Marten also found the section rushed in The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society. Jane Turner Censer pointed to Brenda Stevenson's connection between slaves' brutal treatment and their force used on children as missing from the volume. As for its originality, she also said the book held [...] "few surprises for historians of slavery". Joshua D. Rothman noted {{the same in the}} Journal of the Early Republic. Franklin, writing for History of Education Quarterly, preferred the sections on the unique realities facing these children, such as their relation to puberty and courting, and was not as interested in comparisons between slave children and adults. He bemoaned the original release's organization for only occasionally discussing these practices, and suggested organization by social practices instead of by activity to reduce redundancy. [...] Censer and Marten also complained of this repetition. In The New York Times, Douglas A. Sylva thought the book suffered from weak style and structure, with good research lost in vague topic sentences and conclusions. Franklin additionally noted insufficient citation of relevant secondary literature and recommended a harsher edit, while Loren Schweninger upheld the book's citation quality and accounted for all [...] "important secondary source" [...] on slavery in the back matter.|$|E

Latent variable structural equation modeling was used to determine the effects of rural versus urban or suburban residence on <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> and change <b>in</b> achievement from eighth to tenth grade, and to compare the relative effects ofparental <b>involvement</b> on achievement <b>in</b> rural versus nonrural schools. The results suggest that rural school attendance does not affect either <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> or change <b>in</b> achievement, and that <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> has the same effects on the achievement ofstudents in rural schools as in urban or subur-ban schools. The effect of <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> on achievement is small, but significant and important. The findings suggest that group programs and individual interventions designed to increase <b>parental</b> <b>involvement,</b> if successful, will be equally effective in increasing achievement in rural, urban, and suburban schools. Rural schools are responsible for the education of a significant portion of American school children. Forty-six percent of the school districts in the United States are con-sidered rural (Office of Educational Research and Improve-ment [OERIJ, 1994). These districts include 28 % of the country's schools and serve 17 % of America's school chil-dren (OERI, 1994). Understanding and improving the de-livery of services to this population will have important outcomes for these children, rural communities, and the nation at large. Serving the educational needs of children in rural America poses a unique challenge for educators. Rural schools have several distinct advantages; They often enjoy strong community support (Meehan & DeYoung, 1987) and more <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> than nonrural schools (Williams, 1978).

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of the role of}} parents in their children’s education is not a new concept. Parents have been recognized as their children’s first teachers since the beginning of time. Research in the area of <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> indicates that children whose parents are involved and provide help to them at home and stay in touch with the school score higher than children whose parents are not involved. The present study seeks to identify the type of <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> employed by both parents of high and low achievers in supporting their English Language learning. The level of achievement in this study is {{based on the results of}} their PMR English paper. According to past researches, <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> activities <b>in</b> the children’s learning at home are of different ways and to varying degrees. This study hopes to uncover what type of <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> activities <b>in</b> the home that can have impact on the levels of attainment particularly in the process of English Language learning. The theoretical basis of the study is based on the framework proposed by Epstein (2002) where she states that there are two aspects of <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> which are: home -based Involvement and school-based Involvement. For the purpose of this study, home-based involvement will be measured by three dimensions namely; learning support, home enrichment, and home limitation. While schoolbased involvement will be measured by school communication, and school activities. The present study adopted a mixed method where data obtained was derived from two types of instruments: survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. A total of 60 students reported the extent to which their parents have been involved in these aspects of parental activities. Overall results from the present study revealed that activities in terms of ‘learning support’, ‘home enrichment’ and ‘home limitation’ were common practices adopted by the parents of high achievers. On the other hand, the parents of low achievers adopted a laisser-faire attitude <b>in</b> their <b>involvement.</b> Implication for the study included the need to conduct needs analysis identifying what are the concerns and issues surrounding parent <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> the language education of their children. In addition, academicians could develop a repertoire of strategies in English language learning designed to increase <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> at school and at home.
