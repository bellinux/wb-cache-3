They are used when a moving element {{needs to be in}} electrical contact with a static element. The main advantage of the system is the self-cleaning facility of the skate/ski with the stud.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} a developed computational model {{to study a}} stress-strain state of the assembly unit components of a medium-speed diesel engine of new generation, type CH 26. 5 / 31, which comprises a cylinder head, a sleeve, a gasket, a block, two mounting <b>studs</b> and four <b>power</b> <b>studs.</b> The developed three-dimensional finite element model {{presented in this article}} allows us to take into consideration all the components that make up a gas joint, regardless of their geometric complexity. Its use enables us to estimate the cylinder head - gasket - sleeve tightness of sealing when applying the mounting, temperature, and gas loads, to define the stress and strain components of parts, as well as to study the gasket condition, including pressure distribution across its surface. Based on the results obtained in the study the finite element model of the cylinder head was modified considering a more detailed description of its geometry, thus reducing the principal tensile stresses. </p...|$|R
5000|$|The stud {{contact system}} is a once-obsolete {{ground-level}} power supply system for electric trams. <b>Power</b> supply <b>studs</b> were set in the road at intervals and connected to a buried electric cable by switches operated by magnets on the tramcars. Current was collected from the studs by a [...] "skate" [...] or [...] "ski collector" [...] under the tramcar. The system was popular {{for a while in}} the early 1900s but soon fell out of favour because of the unreliability of the magnetic switches.|$|R
50|$|Objects in the museum’s African {{collection}} {{come from}} West Africa and Central Africa. The objects date {{primarily from the}} 16th to the 20th centuries, although the earliest object is a Nok terracotta bust from Nigeria that dates from somewhere between 200 BC to 200 AD. Some works in the collection were created as symbols of leadership and status, while others express concepts related to the cycle of life. Highlights of the collection include a Benin plaque of copper alloy over wood depicting a warrior chief, a carved wood Senufo rhythm pounder from southeastern Mali, and a Congo standing <b>power</b> figure <b>studded</b> with ritually embedded iron nails or blades.|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} {{solution is to}} use studs. All the systems have a switch in the stud and a means to switch on the stud only while it is covered by the moving vehicle. As at least one stud must {{be covered by the}} collector at all times a long collector is used. The length has to be slightly greater than the maximum distance between any two studs. This collector is known as a skate or ski collector. This type of electrical power collector needs to move in the vertical plane to allow for natural differences in the height of the <b>power</b> supply <b>studs.</b> It is used on some full size tramway systems where {{there is a need for}} overhead wires not to be used, usually in areas of scenic value.|$|R
50|$|Tram 49 is {{operated}} by the Black Country Living Museum. This double decker tram was originally built in 1909 for Wolverhampton Corporation Tramways. It is a typical Edwardian tramcar with an ornate lower saloon and open upper deck with traverse seating. Originally equipped with the Lorain system taking its <b>power</b> supply from <b>studs</b> in the road, it was later converted to run from overhead wires. Preserved in 1976, the tram was painstakingly restored by the Black Country Museum Transport Group over many years and completed in 2004.|$|R
50|$|After {{recording}} Julie Driscoll's eponymous album (1969), Cregan {{joined the}} soft rock band Stud. The group featured Cregan, John Weider from Family, and also John Wilson and Richard McCracken, the rhythm section from Taste (best known as Rory Gallagher's pre-solo <b>power</b> trio). <b>Stud</b> dissolved when Cregan moved to Family in September 1972, after recording two albums which were released in Germany, {{where they had}} their largest audience. He joined Charlie Whitney and Roger Chapman, replacing bassist John Wetton, adapting from rhythm guitar to bass guitar. He toured North America with the band, as the support act for Elton John, {{in the autumn of}} 1972. Family recorded two singles and a final album It's Only a Movie (1973). A tour of the UK in the autumn of the same year preceded the demise of the band. Cregan was then briefly reunited with Chapman and Whitney on Chapman Whitney Streetwalkers (1974).|$|R

40|$|Multiple {{treatment}} group clinical trials are frequently used in Phase III clinical drug development to establish {{differences between the}} {{treatment group}}s {{for the purposes of}} satisfying regulatory requirements. Because of the multiplicity of treatment group comparisons, the design and analysis should consider a multiple comparison procedure which controls the experiment-wise Type I error rate a and maintains power. The procedure should also be suitable for the design objectives of the trial. Many common multiple comparison procedures (MCPs) control the experiment-wise Type I error rate in a liberal way, while other MCPs control the experiment-wise Type I error rate in a conservative way. Generally, liberal MCPs are more powerful than conservative MCPs, however, do not control the experiment-wise Type I error rate at the nominal level.

50|$|Electric {{railways}} with third rails, {{or fourth}} rails, in tunnels carry collector shoes projecting laterally (sideways), or vertically, from their bogies. The contact shoe may slide {{on top of}} the third rail (top running), on the bottom (bottom running) or on the side (side running). The side running contact shoe is used against the guide bars on rubber-tired metros. A vertical contact shoe is used on ground-level <b>power</b> supply systems, <b>stud</b> contact systems and fourth rail systems. A pair of contact shoes was used on underground current collection systems. The contact shoe on a stud contact system is called a ski collector. The ski collector moves vertically to accommodate slight variations in the height of the studs. Contact shoes may also be used on overhead conductor rails, on guide bars or on trolley wires. Most railways use three rails, while the London Underground uses four rails.|$|R
40|$|Occurrence of atrial {{fibrillation}} {{is a common}} complication after coronary surgery. This study aimed to identify the perioperative factors {{that are associated with}} its occurrence with specific attention to the possible influence of the choice of the anesthetic regimen after elective coronary surgery. A retrospective chart analysis was performed in 460 patients who underwent elective coronary artery surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass using the standard institutional anesthetic, surgical and postoperative protocols. The only difference in management was the choice of the primary anesthetic regimen. 110 patients had a total intravenous anesthesia with propofol, 90 patients had a total intravenous anesthesia with midazolam, 150 patients were anesthetized with sevoflurane and 110 patients with desflurane. The primary outcome variable was the incidence of {{atrial fibrillation}} within the first 24 postoperative hours. Atrial fibrillation occurred in 64 of the 460 patients included (13. 9 %). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified increased age (> 70 years), EuroSCORE > 4, prolonged CPB time (> 100 min) and need for prolonged inotropic support (> 6 hours) as the significant independent risk factors for the occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation. The incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation differed among the different anesthetic groups with the lowest incidence in the sevoflurane group (propofol: 17 / 110; midazolam: 15 / 90; sevoflurane: 9 / 150; desflurane: 23 / 110) (p = 0. 004).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Accurate {{determination}} of sperm concentration in fluid suspension {{is a critical}} component in a semen analysis. Inaccurate estimations can lead to misinterpretation of the spermiogram and, {{in the case of}} livestock production, can lead to faulty insemination dos-es, which can adversely affect <b>stud</b> <b>power,</b> fertility, fecundity, and cost effectiveness of breeding programs. Capillary-loaded slides, like the hemacytometer, have been the standard for calibration of other concentration estimation modalities such as photometry, Coulter counter, flow cytometry, and computer-automated semen analysis (CASA). Single-use capillary-loaded slides, much smaller than the hemacytometer, are frequently used by many of the current CASA systems. As the use of CASA increases, more field reports are sug-gesting differences between CASA results and hemacytometry. In this article, we establish that these differences are, in large part, due to the Segre-Silberberg effect, which occurs during Poiseuille flow in high-gradient fluid flow in thin capillary-loaded slides. We develop the theory of this phenomenon and derive the scaling and signifi-cance of the effect. Finally, we graphically provide a means for pre-dicting the necessary compensation factor when using capillary-loaded slides to determine sperm concentration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A modular He-cooled {{divertor}} {{concept for}} DEMO {{is being investigated}} at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK) {{within the framework of}} the EU power plant conceptual study. The design goal is to reach a heat flux of at least 10 MW/m 2. The reference design HEMJ (helium-cooled modular divertor with jet cooling) consists of a hexagonal tungsten tile which is brazed to a thimble made of W- 1 %La 2 O 3. The cooling is realized by impingement jets of high pressure helium through an array of small jet holes located at the top of a cartridge made of ODS Eurofer. The current divertor work programme focuses on manufacture and high-heat-flux tests of prototypical tungsten mock-ups to demonstrate the manufacturability and the performance of the design. The tests were performed in a combined helium loop and Tsefey EB facility at Efremov. The first two high-heat-flux test series on 1 -finger mock-ups in 2006 - 2007 already confirmed the divertor performance. Clear progress was achieved in the continuation third high-heat-flux test series in 2008 after the quality in mock-up manufacturing has been significantly improved. Technological study on fabrication of a 9 -finger module of stain less steel was also successfully performed. First thermo-hydraulic tests showed uniform distribution of mass flow rates which agrees well with calculation results. 1.
