40|$|AIM: Investigation of {{the risks}} of {{radiation}} exposure among an interventionalist, assistant and sonographer during installation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) by assessment of the fractional dose in comparison to dose threshold values. Moreover, an evaluation of additional measures towards radiation shielding protection was undertaken. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 30 TIPS, the surface doses were measured using thermoluminescence detectors (TLD) which were attached to the eyebrows, {{both sides of the}} thyroids, backs of the hands, lower legs over the tibia, the breast, umbilicus and symphysis. The values measured were considered to represent a conservative estimation for organs beneath these sites. During the first 15 interventionists, the interventionalist, assistant and sonographer wore only a lead apron, whereas in the next 15 interventionists, they wore a thyroid protecting shield as well. Furthermore, a lead glass plate was positioned between the interventionist and the video amplifier, a protection of {{the lower part of the}} body was placed between the sonographer and the X-ray tube, and the sonographer wore a lead protecting glove on the hand used to hold the accustic header. RESULTS: The highest surface dose without any additional protection was measured among the intervestionalist, the assistant and the sonographer standing to the right of the patient, on the left tibia. The <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> <b>dose</b> of the red bone marrow  considered upon simplification to be represented by the surface dose of the tibia  allowed a dose threshold value compliance of a maximum of 12, 18, 62, that is, 32 TIPS interventions per year. For the interventions with permanent protection, thyroid protection, lead protecting gloves and lower body protection, the highest surface dose for the interventionalist and assistant was measured in the right tibia, and for the sonographer in the left hand. The <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> <b>dose,</b> considered upon simplification to be represented by the surface dose of the tibia, allowed the interventionalist a maximum of 15, and the assistant a maximum of 21 TIPS per year. The sonographer, when standing to the left could have carried out more than 750 TIPS, and when standing to the right, 312 TIPS. By use of the additional protective measures, the stochastic risk of radiation was reduced by 35 % for the interventionalist, 41 % for the assistant, and 65 % for the sonographer. CONCLUSIONS: Protection of the lower body had a decisive effect on the compliance of dose threshold values, because without protection of the lower body, tibia bone marrow is subject to a high dose...|$|E
40|$|In {{radiation}} accidents, it {{is common}} that only several {{parts of the body}} are exposed to radiation. As a consequence there is a mixture of exposed and unexposed lymphocytes in peripheral blood cells of the samples. This phenomenon will cause the dose value estimated using the exposed lymphocytes to be lower than the actual dose. In this study, an assessment of partial body exposures using micronucleus assay by estimating the <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> <b>dose</b> and fraction of irradiated blood was conducted. An optimal D 0 value also has been determined in this study to estimate the fraction of irradiated cells. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from three healthy donors were irradiated in vitro with 2 Gy of X-rays. Partial radiation exposure was simulated by mixing the irradiated and non-irradiated blood in different proportions. The proportions of mixtures of blood samples irradiated in vitro were 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 %. Blood samples were then cultured and harvested based on micronuclei assay protocol. At least 2000 binucleated cells with well-preserved cytoplasm were scored for the MN frequency. Dose Estimate 5. 1 software was used to calculate the dispersion index (σ 2 / y) and normalized unit of this index (U) in each proportion of bloods. The fractions of irradiated cells were calculated with CABAS (Chromosomal Aberration Calculation Software) for several different D 0 values (2. 7; 3. 8; 5. 4). The results showed that D 0 value at 5. 4 gave the closest results to the actual proportion of irradiated bloods, while for the dose estimation the estimated doses value from all proportions in all donors were higher than the actual dose. The factor that may cause this phenomenon was that the dose response calibration curve used to predict the radiation dose was not constructed in the laboratory used. Overall it can be concluded that a biodosimetry using MN assay can be used to estimate the radiation dose in partial body exposure. In order to establish a biodosimetry using MN analysis the dose-response calibration curve MN analysis should be constructed first in the laboratory used.   </p...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Ablative {{bone marrow}} {{irradiation}} {{is an integral}} part of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These treatment regimens are based on classically held models of radiation dose and the bone marrow response. Flt- 3 ligand (FL) has been suggested as a marker of hematopoiesis and bone marrow status but the kinetics of its response to bone marrow irradiation has yet to be fully characterized. In the current study, we examine plasma FL response to total <b>body</b> and <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> irradiation in mice and its relationship with irradiation dose, time of collection and pattern of bone marrow exposure. MATERIALS/METHODS: C 57 BL 6 mice received a single whole <b>body</b> or <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> irradiation <b>dose</b> of 1 - 8 Gy. Plasma was collected by mandibular or cardiac puncture at 24, 48 and 72 hr post-irradiation as well as 1 - 3 weeks post-irradiation. FL levels were determined via ELISA assay and used to generate two models: a linear regression model and a gated values model correlating plasma FL levels with radiation dose. RESULTS: At all doses between 1 - 8 Gy, plasma FL levels were greater than control and the level of FL increased proportionally to the total <b>body</b> irradiation <b>dose.</b> Differences in FL levels were statistically significant at each dose and at all time points. <b>Partial</b> <b>body</b> irradiation of the trunk areas, encompassing the bulk of the hematopoietically active bone marrow, resulted in significantly increased FL levels over control but irradiation of only the head or extremities did not. FL levels were used to generate a dose prediction model for total body irradiation. In a blinded study, the model differentiated mice into dose received cohorts of 1, 4 or 8 Gy based on plasma FL levels at 24 or 72 hrs post-irradiation. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that plasma FL levels might be used as a marker of hematopoietically active bone marrow and radiation exposure in mice...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Analysis for {{chromosome}} aberrations {{in human}} peripheral blood lymphocytes {{has been developed}} {{as an indicator of}} dose from ionising radiation. This paper outlines the mechanism of production of aberrations, the technique for their analysis and the dose-effect relationships for various types of radiation. During the past ten years the National Radiological Protection Board has developed a service for the UK in which estimates of dose from chromosome aberration analysis are made on people known or suspected of being accidentally over-exposed. This service can provide estimates where no physical dosemeter was worn and is frequently able to resolve anomalous or disputed data from routine film badges. Several problems in the interpretation of chromosome aberration yields are reviewed. These include the effects of <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> irradiation and the response to variations in dose rate and the intermittent nature of some exposures. The dosimetry service is supported by a research programme which includes surveys of groups of patients irradiated for medical purposes. Two surveys are described. In the first, lymphocyte aberrations were examined in rheumatiod arthritis patients receiving intra-articular injections of colloidal radiogold or radioyttrium. A proportion of the nuclide leaked from the joint into the regional lymphatic system. In the second survey a comparison was made between the cytogenetic and physical estimates of whole <b>body</b> <b>dose</b> in patients receiving iodine 131 for thyroid carcinoma...|$|R

40|$|In {{the event}} of a terrorist-mediated attack in the United States using {{radiological}} or improvised nuclear weapons, it is expected that {{hundreds of thousands of people}} could be exposed to life-threatening levels of ionizing radiation. We have recently shown that genome-wide expression analysis of the peripheral blood (PB) can generate gene expression profiles that can predict radiation exposure and distinguish the dose level of exposure following total body irradiation (TBI). However, in the event a radiation-mass casualty scenario, many victims will have heterogeneous exposure due to partial shielding and it is unknown whether PB gene expression profiles would be useful in predicting the status of partially irradiated individuals. Here, we identified gene expression profiles in the PB that were characteristic of anterior hemibody-, posterior hemibody- and single limb-irradiation at 0. 5 Gy, 2 Gy and 10 Gy in C 57 Bl 6 mice. These PB signatures predicted the radiation status of partially irradiated mice with a high level of accuracy (range 79 – 100 %) compared to non-irradiated mice. Interestingly, PB signatures of <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> irradiation were poorly predictive of radiation status by site of injury (range 16 – 43 %), suggesting that the PB molecular response to <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> irradiation was anatomic site specific. Importantly, PB gene signatures generated from TBI-treated mice failed completely to predict the radiation status of partially irradiated animals or non-irradiated controls.

40|$|Radiation {{accidents}} frequently involve acute high <b>dose</b> <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> irradiation {{leading to}} victims with radiation sickness and cutaneous radiation syndrome that implements radiation-induced cell death. Cells {{that are not}} lethally hit seek to repair ionizing radiation (IR) induced damage, albeit {{at the expense of}} an increased risk of mutation and tumor formation due to misrepair of IR-induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). The response to DNA damage includes phosphorylation of histone H 2 AX in the vicinity of DSBs, creating foci in the nucleus whose enumeration can serve as a radiation biodosimeter. Here, we investigated cH 2 AX and DNA repair foci in peripheral blood lymphocytes of Göttingen minipigs that experienced acute <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> irradiation (PBI) with 49 Gy (66 %) Co- 60 c-rays of the upper lumbar region. Blood samples taken 4, 24 and 168 hours post PBI were subjected to c-H 2 AX, 53 BP 1 and MRE 11 focus enumeration. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of 49 Gy <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> irradiated minipigs were found to display 1 – 8 DNA damage foci/cell. These PBL values significantly deceed the high foci numbers observed in keratinocyte nuclei of the directly c-irradiated minipig skin regions, indicating a limited resident time of PBL in the exposed tissue volume. Nonetheless, PBL samples obtained 4 h post IR in average contained 2. 2 % of cells displaying a pan-cH 2 AX signal, suggesting that these received a higher IR dose.

Here, measurements of c-H 2 AX immunofluorescence by microscopy and flow cytometry were compared as rapid biodosimetric tools for whole and <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> exposures. Ex vivo uniformly X-irradiated blood lymphocytes from one donor were used to generate a universal biexponential calibration function for c-H 2 AX foci/intensity yields per unit dose for time points up to 96 hours post exposure.

40|$|We {{formulated}} PA- 824, a nitroimidazopyran with {{promise for}} the treatment of tuberculosis, for efficient aerosol delivery to the lungs in a dry powder porous particle form. The objectives of this study were to prepare and characterize a particulate form of PA- 824, assess the stability of this aerosol formulation under different environmental conditions, and determine the pharmacokinetic parameters for the powder after pulmonary administration. The drug was spray dried into porous particles containing a high drug load and possessing desirable aerosol properties for efficient deposition in the lungs. The physical, aerodynamic, and chemical properties of the dry powder were stable at room temperature for 6 months and under refrigerated conditions for at least 1 year. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined in guinea pigs after the pulmonary administration of the PA- 824 powder formulation at three doses (20, 40, and 60 mg/kg of body weight) and compared to those after the intravenous (20 mg/kg) and oral (40 mg/kg) delivery of the drug.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{suitability}} of the cytokinesis block micronucleus assay as a biological dosimeter following in-vivo radiation using cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. Methods: Blood from 4 healthy donors was irradiated in vitro with γ-rays and the dose response of induced micronuclei in binucleate lymphocytes following cytokinesis block was determined. Micronucleus frequency was ascertained before and at intervals during radiotherapy treatment in 6 patients with various tumors in the pelvic region. Equivalent whole <b>body</b> <b>doses</b> (physical doses) at these times were calculated from radiation treatment plans and cumulative dose volume histograms. Results: Linear dose response relationships were found for induced micronucleus frequency in lymphocytes resulting from both in-vitro and in-vivo irradiation. Doses resulting from in-vivo irradiation (biological doses) were estimated by substitution of micronucleus frequency observed in radiotherapy patients into the dose response curve from in-vitro irradiation of blood. The relationship between the biologically estimated dose (BD) and the calculated equivalent whole <b>body</b> <b>dose</b> (PD) was BD = 0. 868 (± 0. 043) PD + 0. 117 (± 0. 075). Conclusion: The micronucleus assay appears to offer a reliable and consistent method for equivalent whole <b>body</b> radiation <b>dose</b> estimation, although our findings should be confirmed using lymphocytes from radiotherapy patients with tumors at anatomical sites other than the pelvis. Except at doses lower than about 0. 4 Gy, the method yields dose estimates acceptably close to 'true' physically determined doses.

40|$|Large scale {{radiological}} emergencies require high throughput {{techniques of}} biological dosimetry for population triage {{in order to}} identify individuals indicated for medical treatment. The dicentric assay is the gold standard technique for the performance of biological dosimetry, but it is very time consuming and needs well trained scorers. To increase the throughput of blood samples, semi-automation of dicentric scoring was investigated in the framework of the MULTIBIODOSE EU FP 7 project, and dose effect curves were established in six biodosimetry laboratories. To validate these dose effect curves, blood samples from 33 healthy donors (> 10 donors/scenario) were irradiated in vitro with Co- 60 gamma rays simulating three different exposure scenarios: acute whole <b>body,</b> <b>partial</b> <b>body,</b> and protracted exposure, with three different doses for each scenario. All the blood samples were irradiated at Ghent University, Belgium, and then shipped blind coded to the participating laboratories. The blood samples were set up by each lab using their own standard protocols, and metaphase slides were prepared to validate the calibration curves established by semi-automatic dicentric scoring. In order to achieve this, 300 metaphases per sample were captured, and the doses were estimated using the newly formed dose effect curves. After acute uniform exposure, all laboratories were able to distinguish between 0 Gy, 0. 5 Gy, 2. 0, and 4. 0 Gy (p < 0. 001), and, in most cases, the dose estimates were within a range of +/- 0. 5 Gy of the given dose. After protracted exposure, all laboratories were able to distinguish between 1. 0 Gy, 2. 0 Gy, and 4. 0 Gy (p < 0. 001), and here also a large number of the dose estimates were within +/- 0. 5 Gy of the irradiation <b>dose.</b> After simulated <b>partial</b> <b>body</b> exposure, all laboratories were able to distinguish between 2. 0 Gy, 4. 0 Gy, and 6. 0 Gy (p < 0. 001).
