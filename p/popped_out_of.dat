5|$|In 1924, Goebel {{was again}} {{selected}} as an All-Pro {{player with the}} Tigers, playing in ten games, making two touchdown receptions, and returning a fumble for a touchdown. In all, he was credited with three touchdowns and 18 points in 1924. While playing end for the Columbus Tigers in 1924, Goebel was involved {{in one of the}} oddest plays in NFL history. Goebel was the intended receiver of a forward pass, but the ball <b>popped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his arms and was snatched out of the air by Oscar Knop of the Chicago Bears. Knop began running for the goal line with the ball, but he was running the wrong way toward a safety. After running 30 yards, Knop was caught from behind and tackled by his teammate Ed Healey on the four-yard line.|$|E
25|$|On July 9, 1993, the {{prominent}} Toronto attorney Garry Hoy fell {{from a window}} in a playful attempt to demonstrate {{to a group of}} new legal interns that the windows of the city's Toronto-Dominion Centre were effectively unbreakable. He had performed the same stunt on several previous occasions – dramatically slamming his body against the window – but this time it <b>popped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> its frame and he fell to his death. The accident was later commemorated for its unusual nature by a 1996 Darwin Award and has been re-enacted in several films and television shows.|$|E
25|$|A few marionettes {{were also}} used. Other effects {{required}} large mogwai faces and ears {{to be produced}} for close-ups, as the puppets were less capable of conveying emotion. Consequently, large props simulating food were needed for the close-ups in the scene in which the mogwai feast after midnight. An enlarged Gizmo puppet was also needed for the scene in which he multiplies. The new mogwai, who <b>popped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Gizmo's body as small, furry balls which then started to grow, were balloons and expanded as such. Walas had also created the exploding gremlin in the microwave {{by means of a}} balloon that was allowed to burst.|$|E

She agreed. In the end Carmen said that the party had fun moments {{but it was not a}} success.|$|R
500|$|On February 5, 2015, Woods {{withdrew from}} the Farmers Insurance Open after another back injury. Woods stated on his website that it was {{unrelated}} to his previous surgery and he would {{take a break from}} golf until his back healed. He returned for the Masters, finishing in a tie for 17th. In the final round, Woods injured his wrist after his club hit a tree root. He later stated that a bone <b>popped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his wrist, but he adjusted it back into place and finished the round. Woods then missed the cut at the 2015 U.S. Open and Open Championship, the first time ever Woods missed the cut at consecutive majors, finishing {{near the bottom of the}} leaderboard both times. He finished tied for 18th at the Quicken Loans National on August 2. In late August 2015, Woods played quite well at the Wyndham Championship finishing the tournament at 13-under, only four strokes behind the winner, and tied for 10th place. Woods offered only a brief comment on the speculation that he was still recovering from back surgery, saying it was [...] "just my hip" [...] but offering no specifics.|$|E

The ignition switch was moved from {{the lower part of the}} centre console up to the dashboard, next to the steering wheel and the Range Rover received the Range Rover Sport / LR3's Terrain Response system as well as a redesigned four-wheel drive control panel.|$|E
2500|$|The phrase [...] "Who's your daddy?" [...] {{may have}} been given its first {{widespread}} airing by Tracht in the late 1980s and 1990s on his syndicated radio program. Tracht used the term comedically but left no doubt about its sexual aspects; Tracht put the phrase {{in the mouth of}} his imagined male characters while they {{were in the middle of}} [...] "a zesty session." [...] Tracht said he first heard the reference in The Zombies song [...] "Time of the Season." [...] He said, [...] "I converted it to have a spicy connotation.

2500|$|Some graves {{were found}} purely by accident. A farmer {{working in his}} field tripped on a wire {{sticking}} out of the ground. He pulled on it to remove it and a skeletal hand <b>popped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ground. Other graves were found when people noticed suspiciously green grass in sandy areas. [...] The Da Mai Creek massacre was discovered after three VC defected and told authorities about the murders. [...] An ARVN soldier on patrol south of Hue noticed a wire {{sticking out of the}} ground. Thinking it was a booby trap, he very carefully worked to uncover it. He discovered the body of an old man, his hands tied together with the wire. Two days later 130 bodies had been uncovered.|$|E
2500|$|According to George Maestri, Rocko has {{no family}} name because the writers {{did not think}} of a family name that they desired. In a concept sketch Murray named the {{character}} [...] "Rocko Rama". The writers considered the family name [...] "Stretchbrain" [...] because the character's brain <b>popped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his head during [...] "odd moments." [...] The writers scrapped the idea, leaving the character with one given name. Some websites, including Hot Topic, give him the family name [...] "Wallabee" [...] and the middle name [...] "James". In [...] "Dental Hyjinks," [...] the first story of the Marvel Comics Rocko's Modern Life series Issue #1 , the nurse addresses Rocko as [...] "Mr. Rocko." [...] In [...] "Intestinal Turmoil," [...] the first story of Issue #2, the doctor addresses Rocko as [...] "Mr. Rocko" [...] and Rocko answers the telephone with the words [...] "Rocko residence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Queen Maedbdh's {{army had}} {{set off in}} the same {{direction}} towards Barrooskey but to their surprise they met opposition from small bands of the Gamhanraidh tribes who <b>popped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> every crevice along the way, attacking the retreating troops trying to return to Cruachan. [...] There were so many of these attacks that while the army was still in the Glenamoy hills, the melee turned into a full-scale battle again. [...] The indomitable Gamhanraidh made a grotesque pile of Irish warrior heads on the ground. [...] At this stage, Domhnall from Glencastle arrived on the scene again with a new army which consisted of vicious wolf hounds. [...] Their handlers released the dogs and they tore into Maedbh's amy tearing the soldiers limb from limb. Then Fergus came in face to face combat with Domhnall Duabhuidhe and he died at Glenamoy by the sword of Fergus. [...] More troops to support the Gamhanraidh were coming to the scene from Croagh Patrick. [...] After the death of his grandfather, Muireadhach, known as Muireadhach the Stutterer, became the leader of the Gamhanraidh and continued the attack on Maedbdh's troops until he recovered Flidhais and her Maol. [...] Some versions relate that Muireadhach later married Flidhais, others that she lived out {{the rest of her life}} in obscurity.|$|E

2500|$|Numerous VC/NVA {{actions were}} quick, {{harassment}} affairs- firing a few mortar or artillery rounds and then disappearing. But others involved detailed planning and execution. These {{offensive and defensive}} tactics often involved luring ARVN and US troops into a maze of concealed fortifications, or into ambush positions, {{where they could be}} bled before the People's Army Forces withdrew. Initial positions were sometimes made to appear deliberately weak, including unmanned bunkers and light sniper-type resistance to bait enemy forces inside the killing zone. In the meantime, more lethal elements maneuvered and concentrated inside the fortified complex to inflict maximum damage. Less elaborate than the fortified bunker complexes were individual [...] "spider holes" [...] - one-man excavations, some 2 feet wide by 4–5 feet deep, with a vegetation-covered lid, carefully camouflaged to be invisible from the air, or even foot-infantry several yards away. One US Marine memoir describes 12 such spider holes strung along both sides of a road, covered with grass and then dirt. As a US convoy passed, the NVA <b>popped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> these hideaways and opened fire, pinning down the entire column. Supporting mortars behind the spider holes hammered the trapped Americans for several hours before the NVA pulled out. Bait tactics could also tie down expensive air-power resources, particularly helicopter assets (see Fighting American Air Mobile Operations below).|$|E
2500|$|Despite being {{common in}} German and English-language journalism during World War II, the word [...] was never {{used by the}} Wehrmacht as an {{official}} military term, except for propaganda. Some senior officers, including Kurt Student, Franz Halder and Johann Adolf von Kielmansegg, even disputed {{the idea that it}} was a military concept. Kielmansegg asserted that what many regarded as blitzkrieg was nothing more than [...] "ad hoc solutions that simply <b>popped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the prevailing situation". Student described it as ideas that [...] "naturally emerged from the existing circumstances" [...] as a response to operational challenges. The Wehrmacht never officially adopted it as a concept or doctrine. In 2005, the historian Karl-Heinz Frieser summarized blitzkrieg as the result of German commanders using the latest technology in the most beneficial way according to traditional military principles and employing [...] "the right units {{in the right place at}} the right time". Modern historians now understand blitzkrieg as the combination of the traditional German military principles, methods and doctrines of the 19th century, with the military technology of the interwar period. Modern historians use the term casually as a generic description for the style of manoeuvre warfare practised by Germany during the early part of World War II, rather than as an explanation. According to Frieser, in the context of the thinking of Heinz Guderian on mobile combined arms formations, blitzkrieg can be used as a synonym for modern manoeuvre warfare on the operational level.|$|E
