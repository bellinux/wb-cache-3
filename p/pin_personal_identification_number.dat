25|$|The BlackBerry <b>PIN</b> (<b>Personal</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Number)</b> is an eight-character {{hexadecimal}} {{identification number}} {{assigned to each}} BlackBerry device. PINs cannot be changed manually on the device (though BlackBerry technicians are able to reset or update a PIN server-side), and are locked to each specific BlackBerry. BlackBerry devices can message each other using the PIN directly or by using the BlackBerry Messenger application. BlackBerry PINs are tracked by BlackBerry Enterprise Servers and the BlackBerry Internet Service and are used to direct messages to a BlackBerry device. Emails and any other messages, such as those from the BlackBerry Push Service, are typically directed to a BlackBerry device's PIN. The message can then be routed by a RIM Network Operations Center, and sent to a carrier, which will deliver the message the last mile to the device. In September 2012 RIM announced that the BlackBerry PIN would be replaced by users' BlackBerry ID starting in 2013 with {{the launch of the}} BlackBerry 10 platform.|$|E

The paper employs an algorithm using the keystroke dynamics which attempts to minimize compromising the security when the imposter get hold of both user-ID (user card) and password. Experiments were conducted using passwords of varying length by a group of users. The paper reports the results of the experiments and recommends an optimum number of digits in passwords when this biometric is used. The experimental results were encouraging for PINs of length 4 - 12 digits where the rate of rejection of legitimate users (FRR) was zero while the rate of acceptance of the imposter (FAR) was below 20 %...|$|R

We describe a simple and e#cient protocol based on oblivious transfer to check mutual knowledge of a common string {{in such a way that}} honest parties will always succeed in convincing each other, while a dishonest party interacting with an honest party will have vanishingly small probability of convincing him. Moreover, a dishonest party gains only a very small amount of information about the secret string from running the protocol: whoever enters the protocol with no knowledge of the secret string would have to enter this protocol an exponential number of times in order to gain non-negligible information about the string. 1 Introduction Didn't you worry last time you typed your <b>PIN</b> (<b>Personal</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Number)</b> to an unknown Automated Teller Machine (ATM) that it could be a fake and that the sole purpose of this ATM could be t [...] ...|$|E
30|$|We {{consider}} the ATM a suitable example {{to explain the}} life-cycle theory. This is because its development, as explained in an earlier paper on ATMs by Arthur (2017) and by Harper and Batiz-Lazo (2013), involved a continuous sequence of events {{over a long period}} of 18  years. We could argue that the development of the ATM began with an innovation outside of the financial sector, the development of automation and its use in retail services. This was an event in history that created a logical necessity for the use of automation in financial services following pressures on financial institutions in Europe and the United States to limit Saturday banking and branch expansion activities, respectively. Thus in the early twentieth century, bankers, engineers, and end-users began efforts to create a secure and reliable automated system that would allow users to perform basic but primary financial transactions at any time. Events in the transition from ideation to commercialization involved device design, the development of associated verification systems such as <b>PINs</b> (<b>personal</b> <b>identification</b> <b>numbers)</b> and PANs (<b>personal</b> access numbers), and enhancement of device capabilities. Each step in the development process was an evolution of previous designs, security systems, and functional capabilities. Therefore, while the first version of the ATM, for example, could only dispense cash, newer versions could do much more including accept deposits and print balances. Additionally, advancements in information and communication technology have led to additional add-ons to the ATM. The latest units are web-enabled, modular, and have memory storage features that allow the customization and coordination of payments across financial institutions.|$|R

40|$|In {{traditional}} Point of Sales (POS) device, {{the legitimate}} user is mainly authenticated by <b>PIN</b> (<b>Personal</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Number).</b> PIN method has drawbacks like {{easy to be}} forgotten.

Although keystroke pattern as one kind of biometrics is in research for years, no real satisfied results have been got due to its inherent great variability. In this paper, we proposed an innovative method by adapting and increase keystroke pattern technology to POS device and applications. Together with fingerprint system, the adapted keystroke pattern recognition system constitute a multibiometric system, which helps achieve an increase in performance, and provide anti-spoofing measures by making it difficult for an intruder to spoof multiple biometric traits simultaneously. Since this approach is a combination of partially featurebased and partially knowledge-based, it can be a more deployable alternative to strengthen existing PIN and pure biometric authentication methods. Experimental results support that this approach can be better trade-off of the security and user convenience...|$|E

Biometric systems, which are based on unique aspects of human physiology, came into wider usage only recently, when technological advances made such technology viable for wide application.

Biometric access control systems are more reliable, because one cannot accidentally forget one’s eye or finger at home, biometric information cannot be stolen, lost, is hard to counterfeit and it takes human factor out of the equation. Using biometrics is as simple as putting one’s finger or eye to the scanner, saying phrase or just getting photographed by a camera, the systems handles everything else automatically. Nowadays, when IT systems development speed has gone way ahead of hardware capabilities, when IT is rapidly expanding into devices until recently thought to be incompatible with such technology (refrigerators, air conditioners, microwave ovens, etc.) and the world’s need for information is still accelerating, system developers even more frequently look up to distributed systems.
