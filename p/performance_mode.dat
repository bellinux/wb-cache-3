25|$|On February 14, 2014, Toyota {{announced}} a global recall of third generation Prius. The recall {{is related to}} a software fault having been identified in the hybrid-control system which might cause the hybrid drive inverter transistors to overheat. This will cause the car {{to go into a}} limited <b>performance</b> <b>mode</b> (i.e. limp home mode) or may even stall the car entirely. Owners will be notified with a letter to rectify the problem for free of charge or reimbursement for anyone who was charged to rectify the problem prior to recall.|$|E

50|$|In 2007, the {{director}} Lin Zhaohua and the Kunqu Opera master Wang Shiyu revived {{the work and}} sought to challenge previous modern versions.

5000|$|Both <b>performance</b> <b>modes,</b> (wild-style and mallet percussion), {{have been}} {{described}} as cacophonous when considered in traditional Western musical terms, because of the dense elemental acoustic phenomena Z'EV's instruments produce. In point of fact, Z'EV doesn't actually consider the results as [...] "music" [...] per se, but more as orchestrations of highly rhythmic acoustic phenomena.|$|R
5000|$|The Nvidia Jetson TX2 board bears a Tegra X2 of {{microarchitecture}} GP10B (SoC type T186 or very similar). This {{board and}} the associated development platform was announced in March 2017 as a compact card design for low power scenarios, e.g. for the use in smaller camera drones.

50|$|The ASR-10 {{offered a}} {{powerful}} and flexible internal effects unit (later offered as a standalone device in the Ensoniq DP/4), offering the capability to resample an existing sound with an effect, and to process external signals through it live. Up to 62 effects were available to be used, also including a vocoder and distortion. The effects were all programmable, and flexible configurations were available for operating in multitimbral or <b>performance</b> <b>modes.</b>|$|R
500|$|Like the E-series HSV GTS, the {{suspension}} is fitted with switchable Magnetic Ride Control (MRC, or [...] "MagneRide") offering Luxury or <b>Performance</b> <b>modes.</b> It does this by electrically adjusting the viscosity of the ferrofluid inside the shock absorbers, producing different damping levels. Magnetic Ride Control also enhances braking by preventing forward weight transfer {{when the car}} is under heavy braking. The MRC system development took three years and cost HSV more than $4.5 million.|$|R
50|$|The TX81Z can run quite quickly out of resources, {{especially}} under <b>Performance</b> <b>Mode,</b> {{where the}} 8 voices are shared between the 16 MIDI channels. It is also quite sensitive to System Exclusive messages timing when being edited remotely. Special {{care must be}} taken not to send System Exclusive messages with a delay too small between them (it can take up to 50ms for the synthesizer to process a new parameter value).|$|E

50|$|The current {{version of}} the {{entry-level}} Motif lineup, also based on the soundset of the Motif XS. It features the same voices as the XS, although with less WaveROM (166 MB vs. the XS's 355 MB), fewer performances (128), fewer arpeggios (999), and fewer editable parameters. The MX series also has no sequencer. It featured a similar USB audio/MIDI interface as the MoX series. The MX is playable in 16-part multi-timbral <b>performance</b> <b>mode,</b> configurable with the third-party Vycro editor. It is also the only keyboard in the Motif family available in a 49-key model (alongside the 61-key MX61).|$|E

The article also argues that writing these sorts of [...] "readerly" [...] performance texts is essentially an act of subversion whereby (screen)writers work in a <b>performance</b> <b>mode</b> only to intentionally bypass production and, thereby, (re)assert narrative representation's textual primacy and (re)claim a direct (re)connection with their audience.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Fuzzy resource-constrained project {{scheduling}} with multiple <b>performance</b> <b>modes</b> covers {{the majority of}} possible situations in practice. This type of scheduling is a typical complex combinatorial optimization problem. Exact approaches may not be viable. To solve this type of problem efficiently and effectively, four metaheuristic approaches, fuzzy GA alone, fuzzy GA with tabu, fuzzy SA and fuzzy SA with tabu have been developed and built into a system in this research. Each approach has its own advantage depending on circumstances. The system developed has practical significance in solving fuzzy {{project scheduling}} in realistic settings, providing a number of efficient and effective approaches...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{focuses on}} the playmaking process of The Last Seven Words of Fernando Pessoa, a theatre piece that examines identity through an imagined encounter of Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa and his literary concept of heteronyms. The process includes two years of research, workshops, various collaborations, several drafts, and seven weeks of rehearsal. This ensemble piece weaves text, movement, and music together to present Pessoa’s life of multiplicity. The creative process employed a mixed method (hybrid) of traditional script creation, devising, and a de-hierarchization of <b>performance</b> <b>modes.</b> The play questions traditional staging in order to engage an audience...|$|R
