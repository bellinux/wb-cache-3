5|$|<b>Patio</b> C {{was added}} to Terrace 1 {{at the same time}} as <b>Patio</b> B, using a large amount of rubble to extend the terrace. It is to the {{northwest}} of <b>Patio</b> A and is slightly lower than it. <b>Patio</b> C is bordered by 2 structures, on the north and west sides, with the West Structure being the largest. The fill beneath the <b>patio</b> has a depth of , which was previously the height of the retaining talud wall of the northwest side of <b>Patio</b> A, as found during excavations. <b>Patio</b> C had 2 construction phases and served an administrative function directly associated with the buildings of <b>Patio</b> A.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, the National Monuments Council ran an {{architectural}} contest to revitalize <b>Patio</b> 29, and chose {{a project that}} would create a music plaza with seven copper columns linking Víctor Jara's tomb with <b>Patio</b> 29. The memorial is made of 3,032 precast concrete bricks.|$|E

5|$|<b>Patio</b> F is on {{a terrace}} {{at the same}} level as Patios D and E. The <b>patio</b> is a closed {{courtyard}} formed by 5 structures on the west and south sides, while the other two sides are formed by the retaining walls of Patios A and C. The structures were residential buildings built upon low platforms, with the principal structure {{on the south side of}} the <b>patio.</b> A long, low platform on the west side supports two structures, labelled as Structures 1 and 2. Excavations of this platform recovered ceramic remains dating to the Late and Terminal Classic.|$|E
5|$|Structure 86 is to {{the west}} of Structure 32, at {{the western edge of the}} West Group. The first phase of {{construction}} dates to the Early Classic, between 150 and 300 AD, when it took the form of a sunken <b>patio,</b> with stairways descending in the middle of its perimeter walls. At the centre of the <b>patio</b> were placed a clay altar and a stone, around which and across the rest of the <b>patio</b> were deposited an enormous number of offerings consisting of ceramic vessels, mostly from the Solano tradition.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{inconsistencies}} {{was whether}} the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when checking on the children. According to the Polícia Judiciária case file, Gerry stated during his first interview, on 4 May 2007, that the couple had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the unlocked <b>patio</b> doors at the back. (The <b>patio</b> doors could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to let themselves in.) There was also an inconsistency about whether the front door had been locked. Gerry told the Sunday Times in December 2007 that they had used the front door earlier in the week, but it was next to the children's bedroom, so they had started using the <b>patio</b> doors instead.|$|E

50|$|The site {{is made up}} by many <b>patios</b> of {{approximately}} 50 x 40 meters, or even larger; in some of them obsidian and stone workshops (stone tools) were found, hence a clear division and specialization of its inhabitants work is deduced. According to García Cook, rural people settled in low lands, leaving people with social rank the intermediate areas and, finally, at the top were temples, ball games, and the houses of chiefs and leaders. Evidence indicate that the <b>patios</b> were residential places for Cantona family groups; such is the amount, that in sector V, 620 <b>patios</b> were detected and 997 mounds, including housing units, altars and pyramids.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 1558, {{with the}} {{invention}} of the <b>patio</b> process to extract silver from ore using mercury, mercury became an essential resource in the economy of Spain and its American colonies. Mercury was used to extract silver from the lucrative mines in New Spain and Peru. Initially, the Spanish Crown's mines in Almadén in Southern Spain supplied all the mercury for the colonies. Mercury deposits were discovered in the New World, and more than 100,000 tons of mercury were mined from the region of Huancavelica, Peru, over the course of three centuries following the discovery of deposits there in 1563. The <b>patio</b> process and later pan amalgamation process continued to create great demand for mercury to treat silver ores until the late 19th century.|$|E

At the ceremony, <b>Patio</b> 29 was described {{as a symbol of the}} country's painful history and an educational place for human rights. As a national monument, the site will be conserved and maintained by government funds unless ordered otherwise by the courts. It is the first cemetery to become a national monument in Chile.|$|E

5|$|Structure C8 is a {{residential}} compound that was accessed from the alley {{running to the}} East Plaza from behind Pyramid C1. The entrance opened onto the alley from a <b>patio</b> situated in the southern portion of the compound. This <b>patio</b> was surrounded on the east, west and north sides by rooms, with the alley to the south. It was floored with stucco and Structure C8 was the only stuccoed residential building {{in the whole of}} the city. The north range of rooms backed directly onto the ravine immediately to the north of Group C; the lower portion of the walls of the west room and of half of the north room still stand. The west room was square while the north room was narrow and probably extended the entire width of the <b>patio.</b> Wear marks in the stucco floor indicate that a door once accessed the north room from the west. The workmanship of Structure C8 was of very high quality and indicates that it was the residence of a member of the city's elite. Its proximity to the large pyramid-temple C1 has led archaeologist Henri Lehmann to speculate that it was once the house of the high priest.|$|E
5|$|The {{apartment}} block {{was not a}} gated complex. Located {{on the corner of}} Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva and Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins, 5A was accessible to the public from two sides. Sliding glass <b>patio</b> doors in the living room at the back overlooked the Ocean Club's pool, tennis courts, tapas restaurant and bar. The <b>patio</b> doors could be accessed via a public street, Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins, where a small gate and set of steps led to 5A's balcony and living room. 5A's front door was {{on the opposite side of}} the block from the Ocean Club, on Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva.|$|E
5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The <b>patio</b> doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the <b>patio</b> and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E
