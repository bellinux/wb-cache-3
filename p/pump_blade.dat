40|$|For pumping {{stations}} installed blade full-adjustable pumps with frequently varying {{head in a}} wide range, adjusting <b>pump</b> <b>blade</b> angles is {{an effective}} way to realize optimum operation. Optimal mathematical models were established aiming at the least daily operation cost for pumping station system, which includes main pump units, inlet and outlet passages and their accessories, forebay and outlet pond, auxiliary equipment, power transmission and transformation equipment, other electromechanical equipments and lightings. Also, head varying, time-varying electrical price, and blade adjusting frequency are all taken into account. Meanwhile, the influences of the blade adjusting frequency on operation cost are researched. The results indicate that the operation cost is reduced by 5. 64 %∼ 12. 13 % by the optimal schemes considering time-varying electrical price and adjusting <b>pump</b> <b>blade</b> angles than that of conventional schemes, taking Jiangdu Forth Pumping Station in China as a case. The more the blade adjusting frequency, the less the operation cost. Also, if the blade adjusting frequency exceeds eight times, the optimum operation cost is close to be a const. Therefore, it is advisable to adjust blade angles four to six times a day to save operation cost and guarantee the reliability of pump units...|$|E

The {{centrifugal}} pump {{is the common}} mechanical equipment, which is extensively applied in the water conservancy, ships and other projects, and the blade structure {{is a very important}} part in the {{centrifugal pump}}.

Failure probabilities for different fatigue cycles have been computed and the uncertainties associated with damage initiation and damage propagation due to different load cycles have been quantified. Evaluations on the effect of mistuned blades on a rotor have been made; uncertainties in the excitation frequency have been found to significantly amplify the blade responses of a mistuned rotor.

Most importantly, the vortex size is greatly decreased compared with the target. Since a vortex consists of a multitude of rotating flows, it really poses a threat to the stable inner flows and can also lead to unsteady forces on the runner blade [25, 26]. Therefore, as for the optimal samples, the reduction of the vortexes would lead to a performance improvement of the inner flows relative to the target pump.|$|R

40|$|The {{flow field}} in the stator of a clear torque {{converter}} was studied using laser velocimetry. Five planes in the stator were studied at a speed ratio of 0. 800 and three planes were studied at a speed ratio of 0. 065. Data complements previously available pump and turbine data. Flow in the stator inlet plane is highly non-uniform due to the complicated flow exiting the turbine. At the 0. 800 speed ratio, separation regions {{are located in the}} 1 / 4 and mid-planes in the corepressure corner region. In the 3 / 4 and exit planes, separation regions are located in the shellsuction corner. In the inlet plane a region of high velocities is located along the shell near the pressure side for a speed ratio of 0. 800. The high velocity region migrated to the shell-suction corner and suction side in the 1 / 4 and mid-planes. The overall velocity field for the speed ratio of 0. 065 changes significantly from the inlet plane to the mid-plane. The velocity magnitude generally decreases from the suction to the pressure side of the inlet plane and {{the general direction of the}} tangential velocity is from pressure-to-suction surface. At the speed ratio of 0. 065 a strong secondary flow in the inlet from suction surface to pressure surface was seen. However, at the high speed ratio a moderate secondary flow in the inlet from pressure surface to suction surface was observed. Mass flow rates at the different planes are within the experimental uncertainty and also within the uncertainty of pump and turbine mass flow rates. The flow in the stator inlet plane are significantly influenced by the turbine relative blade position. The turbine influence on the mid-plane data is significantly less than on the inlet plane data.

Recently, there has been strong interest in liquid lead (Pb) or liquid lead–bismuth eutectic (LBE) both critical and subcritical systems in a relevant number of Countries, including studies performed in the frame of GENERATION-IV initiative. In this paper, the theoretical and computational findings for three different designs of Primary Circulation Pump (PCP) evolving liquid lead (namely the jet pump, the Archimedean <b>pump</b> and the <b>blade</b> <b>pump)</b> are presented with reference to the ALFRED (Advanced Lead Fast Reactor European Demonstrator) design. The pumps are first analyzed from the theoretical point of view and then modeled with a 3 D CFD code. Required design performance of the pumps are approximatively around an effective head of 2 bar with a mass flow rate of 5000 kg/s. Taking into account the geometrical constraints of the reactor and the fluid dynamics characteristics of the molten lead, the maximum design velocity for molten lead fluid flow of 2 m/s may be exceeded giving rise to unacceptable erosion phenomena of the blade or rotating component of the primary pumping system. For this reason a deep investigation of non-conventional axial pumps has been performed. The results presented shows that the design of the jet pump looks like beyond the current technological feasibility while, once the mechanical challenges of the Archimedean (screw) pump and the fluid-dynamic issues of the <b>blade</b> <b>pump</b> will be addressed, both could represent viable solutions as PCP for ALFRED.

Recent experimental and computational findings show that the collapse of clouds of cavitating bubbles can involve the formation of bubbly shock waves and that the focussing of these shock waves {{is responsible for the}} enhanced noise and damage in cloud cavitation. The recent experiments and computations of Reisman et al. (1) complement the work begun by Morch and Kedrinskii and their co-workers (2, 3, 4) and demonstrate that the very large impulsive pressures generated in bubbly cloud cavitation are caused by shock waves generated by the collapse mechanics of the bubbly cavitating mixture. Here we describe computational investigations conducted to explore these and other phenomena in greater detail as part of an attempt to find ways of ameliorating the most destructive effect associated with cloud cavitation. Understanding such bubbly flow and shock wave processes is important because these flow structures propagate the noise and produce the impulsive loads on nearby solid surfaces in a cavitating flow.
