The previous research has mainly investigated SCED by formulating the problem in different modalities, e. g. preventive or corrective, and devising efficient solutions for SCED. In this paper, we tackle a novel and important direction, and analyze the economic cost <b>of</b> incorporating <b>security</b> constraints in economic dispatch. Inspired by existing inefficiency metrics in game theory and computer science, we introduce notion <b>of</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> as a metric that formally characterizes the economic inefficiency of security-constrained economic dispatch as compared to the original problem without security constraints. Then, we focus on the preventive approach in a simple topology comprising two buses and two lines, and investigate the impact of generation availability and demand distribution on the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> Moreover, we explicitly derive the worst-case input instance that leads to the maximum <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> By extensive experimental study on two test-cases, we verify the analytical results and provide insights for characterizing the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> in general networks...|$|R

One of the primary causes of the sudden run on the bank was {{the failure of a}} scheme created by William Duer, Alexander Macomb and other bankers in the winter of 1791. Duer and Macomb’s plan was to use large loans to gain control of the US debt securities market because other investors needed those securities to make payments on stocks in the Bank of the United States. Additionally, Duer and Macomb were able to create their own credit by endorsing one another’s notes, and did so in hopes of creating a new bank in New York to overtake the existing Bank of New York. On March 9, 1792 Duer stopped making payments to his creditors and simultaneously faced a lawsuit for actions he had taken as Secretary of the Treasury Board in the 1780s. As Duer and Macomb defaulted on their contracts and found themselves in prison, the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> fell more than 20%, all in the matter of weeks.|$|E

Further, the program would allow a one-time option to change the tick size from 5 cents to 10 cents or vice versa. H.R. 3448 also would require the SEC to submit biannual reports to the Congress showing the extent to which different tick sizes are affecting liquidity and trading activity.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine the extent to which balance sheet information affects the <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> the common stocks <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> and financial service firms. It is well known that income statement provides important information for the valuation of common stock. However, in the case <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> and financial service companies, the holding of financial, as opposed to operating, assets and thus the balance sheets <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> and financial service firms may well represent the predominant repository of the information affecting the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> common stock. This paper finds that there are significant changes in stock <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> and financial service firms surrounding the balance sheet disclosure date and that the market reactions to balance sheet information are stronger when there is unexpected good news than where there is unexpected bad news. In general, <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> firm stocks react more to changes in asset values than to changes in earnings. Furthermore, the earnings announcement tends to reinforce the effect of the balance sheet disclosure. The firm posts the largest abnormal stock returns when there is unexpected good news in both income and balance statements...|$|R
50|$|Recent years’ large balance-of-payments {{surplus in}} Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden {{has reduced the}} countries’ foreign debt. In {{addition}} to a balance-of-payments surplus or deficit, {{the size of a}} country’s foreign debt and foreign assets is affected by the exchange rate and the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities.</b> Consequently, Finland’s foreign debt increased noticeably when the price of technology shares increased drastically in the late 1990s due to a large proportion of these shares being owned by households, funds and companies abroad. In this way, these foreign owners held a greater claim on Finland. When share prices decreased drastically in 1999-2001 in the dot-com bubble, it also led to a marked decrease in Finland’s net foreign debt. Iceland’s foreign net debt accounts for close to five times of its GDP. This means that Iceland owes the surrounding world values corresponding to five times the country’s total production. Sweden also had foreign debts by the end of 2010, however, at a much smaller scale. In 2012, all Nordic countries had a surplus on the total balance of payments. Norway accounts for a substantial foreign exchange surplus, which is due to revenue from exports of oil and gas.|$|E

Various theoretical explanations have been advanced to explain such tranching. This paper provides the first systematic testing of such theories using a proprietary database of over 5000 separate tranches in European securitisations raising a total of $ 1 trillion. We find support for asymmetric information and market segmentation explanations for tranching and present evidence on how such different rationales influence the structuring process in practice. We also investigate the impact of tranching on the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> issued. For those issues where our model predicts a higher optimal number of tranches, we find that additional uniquely-rated tranches are associated with higher prices for the issue as a whole. ...|$|E

40|$|Neural {{networks}} and Neurofuzzy {{models have been}} successfully used in the prediction of nonlinear time series. Several learning methods have been introduced to train the Neurofuzzy predictors, such as ANFIS, ASMOD and FUREGA. Many of these methods, constructed over Takagi Sugeno fuzzy inference system, are characterized by high generalization. However, they differ in computational complexity. The emotional Learning, which is successfully used in bounded rational decision making, is introduced as an appropriate method to achieve particular goals in the prediction of real world data. For example, predicting the peaks of sunspot numbers (maximum of solar activity) is more important due to its major effects on earth and satellites. The emotional learning based fuzzy inference system (ELFIS) has the advantages of simplicity and low computational complexity in comparison with other multi-objective optimization methods. The efficiency of proposed predictor is shown in two examples of highly nonlinear time series. Appropriate emotional signal is composed for the prediction of solar activity and <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities.</b> It is observed that ELFIS performs better predictions in the important regions of solar maximum, and is also a fast and efficient algorithm to enhance the performance of ANFIS predictor in both examples. ...|$|E
