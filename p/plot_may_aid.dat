The <b>plots</b> <b>may</b> <b>aid</b> discussion of the calculation procedures. The sample mean is plot is similar to the CUSUM control chart. The sample standard deviation plot and the plots for the mean and standard deviation from probability mass functions are new plots. Motivation and methods of introducing students to these plots are also discussed. Additionally, the <b>plots</b> <b>may</b> be used to show the influence of various terms in the calculations...|$|R

MARPA, ATA (automatic tracking aid), and ARP (automatic radar plotting) all similar functions to ARPA. The major difference of this Radar <b>plotting</b> <b>aids</b> <b>may</b> not be fully equivalent to all ARPA performance standard of IMO approved type which is a mandatory requirement for large ocean-going ships. Therefore, they are less expensive for small craft.|$|R

50|$|Dot plots {{are one of}} the {{simplest}} statistical plots, and are suitable for small to moderate sized data sets. They are useful for highlighting clusters and gaps, as well as outliers. Their other advantage is the conservation of numerical information. When dealing with larger data sets (around 20-30 or more data points) the related stemplot, box <b>plot</b> or histogram <b>may</b> be more efficient, as dot <b>plots</b> <b>may</b> become too cluttered after this point. Dot <b>plots</b> <b>may</b> be distinguished from histograms in that dots are not spaced uniformly along the horizontal axis.|$|R
