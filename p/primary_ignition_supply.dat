50|$|Flame contact welding is a {{very common}} form of welding. The most popular kind of flame contact welding is oxyfuel gas welding.

30|$|In the prairies of the Pacific Northwest, USA, {{fire has}} been reintroduced {{as a tool}} for {{reducing}} non-native, invasive plant cover and promoting the growth and establishment of native plant communities. Head fires and backing fires are the two <b>primary</b> <b>ignition</b> patterns used to complete most prescribed burns, but the relative effectiveness of these two methods on invasive plant control and native enhancement is unknown. A clear understanding of the relationship between fire behavior, fire severity, and fire effects on vegetation and how these metrics are affected by fire ignition patterns could help managers fine tune burn prescriptions to better achieve ecological objectives. We used observations from five prescribed burns in the south Puget Sound prairies of western Washington, USA, to evaluate the relationship between intensity, severity, and effects. Additionally, we collected data from two burns on how ignition patterns affected these relationships. We found a significant positive correlation between maximum surface temperature and fire severity, and a decline in perennial taxa with increasing fire severity. We also found that surface temperatures did not differ between ignition patterns, but a greater area burned at moderate severity in backing fires than in head fires. Ignition patterns differentiated plant communities by changing the number of species present within different life form categories. However, this response was contingent upon site history and pre-burn conditions. Native perennial forbs were associated with head fires in a site with high pre-existing native plant species richness. Native and exotic forbs were associated with backing fires at a site with low pre-existing native plant species richness. Thus, managers may want to consider ignition patterns when planning burn prescriptions in order to achieve particular ecological objectives.|$|R

Seven oils, those of corn, groundnut, palm, rapeseed, soybean, sunflower and the micro-algae species Chlorella protothecoides were tested, with all of the fuels heated to 60 °C, at constant injection timing and constant ignition timing at a constant engine speed of 1200 rpm. All of the vegetable oils exhibited a duration of ignition delay within ± 0. 6 CAD of that displayed by a reference fossil diesel, but displayed much reduced rates of peak heat release rate. The duration of ignition delay was found to increase with an increasing carbon to hydrogen ratio of the vegetable oils, implicating the fatty acid alkyl chain as the primary driver of low temperature reactivity. Peak heat release rates decreased with decreasing vegetable oil viscosity, suggesting a significant degree of fuel cylinder wall and piston bowl impingement. At both injection timings, emissions of NOx were lower for all of the vegetable oils relative to the reference fossil diesel, while those of CO, THC and particulate matter were higher and sensitive to the injection timing...|$|R

The thermal efficiency and the emissions of the engine are very slightly affected by the addition, whereas a significant increase of the knock limited spark timing (KLST) is always measured. A twice-higher augmentation of KLST is noted when CO 2 is added compared to N 2 for an equivalent volumetric concentration.
