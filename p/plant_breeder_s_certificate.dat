40|$|Taking the <b>Plant</b> <b>Breeder’s</b> Rights Act 1994 (Cth) as its focus, {{this article}} explores the notion that <b>plant</b> <b>breeder’s</b> rights are {{out-of-date}} and unnecessary. To do so, this article adopts both descriptive and empirical approaches to examining {{a number of issues}} including: the nature of, and investment in, Australian plant breeding; biopiracy and enforcement; legal disputes and processes; {{and the use of the}} Australian <b>plant</b> <b>breeder’s</b> rights system. This review shows that the Australian <b>plant</b> <b>breeder’s</b> rights scheme is well used, has been progressively amended and extended, and is just one element in a suite of measures geared to stimulate plant-related innovation. As a consequence, future research needs to take into account the heterogeneous character of plant breeding and complementary government initiatives, identify the many reasons why the <b>plant</b> <b>breeder’s</b> rights scheme is seen as viable (or why not) and consider the interrelationships between these elements...|$|R

50|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>breeders</b> {{were also}} {{developing}} {{an array of}} stable varieties in many important plant species. In the early 19th century, Augustin Sageret established the concept of dominance, recognizing that when some plant varieties are crossed, certain characters (present in one parent) usually appear in the offspring; he also found that some ancestral characters found in neither parent may appear in offspring. However, <b>plant</b> <b>breeders</b> made little attempt to establish a theoretical foundation for their work or to share their knowledge with current work of physiology, although Gartons Agricultural <b>Plant</b> <b>Breeders</b> in England explained their system.|$|R

40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>breeders</b> contributed {{enormously}} to {{the agricultural}} {{and economic development}} of the United States. By improving the profitability of farming, <b>plant</b> <b>breeders</b> improved the economic condition of farmers {{and contributed to the}} growth and structure of rural communities. In the years since World War II, agriculture and the quality of rural life have been driven by policies that encouraged and subsidized an agroindustrial production model. <b>Plant</b> <b>breeders</b> responded by developing methods and deploying products attuned to agroindustrial clients. Major achievements by <b>plant</b> <b>breeders</b> of the era include the development of higher-yielding crops suitable to new environments and mechanized harvesting and shipping. As social, technological, and economic changes reinforced the expansion and dominance of the agroindustrial model, rural communities sustained high levels of out-migration. At the same time, a variety of societal and economic forces have encouraged new food system models, including the locavores and community-supported agriculture. Sustainability indices reflect the desire of megaretailers to make the relationship between consumers and the production of their food more transparent. These forces, along with an increased focus on the quality of rural life in America, represent opportunities for <b>plant</b> <b>breeders</b> {{to address the needs of}} new clients, to develop methods appropriate to their client’s values, and to serve traditional clients in new ways...|$|R

40|$|Plant {{breeding}} is {{a highly}} interdisciplinary science that requires the skills and teamwork of many scientists to be successful. In the 21 st century, plant breeding will {{reap the benefits of}} the rapid advances in genomics research and understanding, as well as, advances in information and mechanical technology. The skill and success of <b>plant</b> <b>breeders</b> will be determined by their ability to use their resources efficiently, retaining those proven methodologies and augmenting them with novel approaches to meet their breeding objectives. Once the objective is determined, the <b>plant</b> <b>breeder</b> must: 1. identify and incorporate the needed genetic variability, 2. inbreed and select the useful variant, and 3. evaluate the successful variants to determine those with commercial potential. It has long been understood that <b>plant</b> <b>breeders</b> need to be ruthless with their germplasm so as to avoid wasting time and resources on lines that will never have the opportunity to be released or become useful parents. It may be that with the plethora of new tools, efficient <b>plant</b> <b>breeders</b> will have to be equally ruthless with their access to and use of technology. Though the outcomes of plant breeding are new cultivars, the importance of plant breeding remaining an experimental science will be highlighted, especially for those with the responsibility of educating the next generation of <b>plant</b> <b>breeders</b> in an increasingly privatised world. Finally, some of the great challenges facing wheat improvement that can be addressed by genetics will be discussed as we look to the future...|$|R
