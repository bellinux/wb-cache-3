5|$|Globally, women's {{access to}} health care remains a challenge, both in {{developing}} and developed countries. In the United States, before the Affordable Health Care Act came into effect, 25% of women of child bearing age lacked health insurance. In the absence of adequate insurance, women are likely to avoid important steps to self care such as routine physical examination, screening and prevention testing, and <b>prenatal</b> <b>care.</b> The situation is aggravated by the fact that women living below the poverty line are at greater risk of unplanned pregnancy, unplanned delivery and elective abortion. Added to the financial burden in this group are poor educational achievement, lack of transportation, inflexible work schedules and difficulty obtaining child care, all of which function to create barriers to accessing health care. These problems are much worse in developing countries. Under 50% of childbirths in these countries are assisted by healthcare providers (e.g. midwives, nurses, doctors) which accounts for higher rates of maternal death, up to 1:1,000 live births. This is despite the WHO setting standards, such as a minimum of four antenatal visits. A lack of healthcare providers, facilities, and resources such as formularies all contribute to high levels of morbidity amongst women from avoidable conditions such as obstetrical fistulae, sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer.|$|E

Subjects: Pregnant women and providers of <b>prenatal</b> health <b>care</b> (nurse educators, nurse midwives, and ob-stetricians). Results: We {{found that the}} majority of pregnant women who participated in our survey (61. 7 %) reported that they would accept complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapy as treatment for LBP during pregnancy.

40|$|Background: In many industrialized western {{countries}} immigrants constitute {{a substantial part}} of the population, which is also seen in the <b>prenatal</b> and postnatal <b>care</b> client population. Research in several industrialized {{western countries}} has shown that women of non-western immigrant origin make inadequate use of <b>prenatal</b> and postnatal <b>care.</b> They do not enter timely and/or do not attend all appointments. Several quantitative and qualitative studies in western industrialized countries have investigated factors affecting the use of <b>prenatal</b> and postnatal <b>care</b> by women of non-western immigrant origin. The quantitative studies focused among others on socioeconomic and cultural factors, and the qualitative studies focused among others on experiences and expectations. By taking both quantitative and qualitative studies into account, this systematic review aims to provide a more in depth understanding of the factors affecting the use of <b>prenatal</b> and postnatal <b>care</b> by women of non-western immigrant origin in industrialized countries. Methods: A systematic review of literature published between 1995 and August 2010 was performed in 11 databases and resulted in 6295 titles. A three stage screening process consisting of title, abstract and full text screening was conducted. Each selected abstract and article was screened independently by two reviewers. Data were synthesized by use of narrative and tabular methods. Results: Preliminary results show that cultural factors such as language, accessibility to services such as making appointments and health beliefs such as considering pregnancy not needing special attention, affected the use of <b>prenatal</b> and postnatal <b>care</b> by women of non-western immigrant origin in industrialized western countries. Conclusion: These preliminary results indicate that different specific types of factors need {{to be taken into account}} when developing measures to reduce inadequate use of <b>prenatal</b> and postnatal <b>care</b> by women of non-western immigrant origin in industrialized pwestern countries.

25|$|<b>Prenatal</b> <b>care</b> {{also plays}} a role in the health of women and their children, with excess infant {{mortality}} in impoverished populations and nations representing these differentials in health. According to Ward, poverty is the strongest predictor of insufficient <b>prenatal</b> <b>care,</b> which is caused by three factors that reduce access. These include socieodemographic factors (such as age, ethnicity, marital status, and education), systematic barriers, and barriers based on lack of knowledge, attitudes and life-styles. Several studies show the complex associations between poverty and education, employment, teen births, and the health of the mother and child. Sixty percent of children born into poor families have at least one chronic disease. Maternal mortality also takes a toll. In 1985, The World Health Organization estimated that maternal mortality rates were 150 times higher in developing countries than developed nations.|$|E
