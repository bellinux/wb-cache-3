5|$|The common wasp, Vespula vulgaris, {{engages in}} worker <b>policing,</b> {{and it is}} known that a {{significant}} number of workers have active ovaries. However, studies by researchers have suggested that relatedness may not be the key factor in the development of worker <b>policing.</b> Rather, it is hypothesized that worker <b>policing</b> has been selected due to conflict suppression in the colony.|$|E
5|$|The tree wasp Dolichovespula sylvestris also {{displays}} worker <b>policing.</b> Both egg-eating {{and aggression}} {{are reported in}} these wasp communities, and the queen also engages in the <b>policing</b> process.

5|$|A higher {{percentage}} of female workers of the bee species Apis cerana are reported to activate their ovaries than those of Apis mellifera or Apis florea. When queens were removed, up to 40% of the workers activated their ovaries in subsequent days. However, <b>policing</b> workers continued to eat the worker-laid eggs, suggesting that the mechanism of <b>policing</b> in this species does not involve direct intervention from the queen.|$|E

5|$|Experiments {{confirming}} {{the role of}} kin selection in worker <b>policing</b> demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, {{which can lead to}} lower average relatedness between workers. Queens of the social wasp Dolichovespula saxonica mate singly or multiply. Researchers who study these wasps have observed a strong positive correlation between worker relatedness and male production. After controlling for the absolute number of eggs laid, these scientists conclude that the queen's multiple matings favor mutual worker <b>policing.</b>|$|E

5|$|In a test {{of worker}} <b>policing,</b> {{researchers}} examined the removal of worker-laid eggs in Vespula rufa, a wasp that has low paternity. Under the testing conditions, worker <b>policing</b> was not as efficient, {{and some of the}} drones appeared to be from worker-laid eggs.|$|E
5|$|In the ponerine ant Harpegnathos saltator, worker <b>policing</b> {{prevents}} {{the number of}} reproductive workers from becoming excessive. The species has gamergates, which lay eggs but rarely carry out any other tasks, so having {{too many of them}} would reduce the colony's efficiency. Gamergate numbers are rather stable, as infertile workers target newly ovipositing workers by jumping on and holding them: this efficiently inhibits them from laying eggs, and within a few weeks they revert to being subordinate and infertile workers. However, once new ovipositing workers attain a gamergate's level of ovarian activity, the infertile (<b>policing)</b> workers ignore them. The signal used by the <b>policing</b> workers consists of cuticle hydrocarbons transmitted only by direct contact, rather than being a pheromone detected by olfaction. Similarly, the inhibition of ovipositing workers is achieved by direct physical aggression by <b>policing</b> workers, not by any pheromone produced by queens or gamergates.|$|E
5|$|In the thelytokous ant Platythyrea punctata, colonies are clonal; therefore, {{workers are}} all equally related genetically, and worker <b>policing</b> is not {{expected}} {{as there is no}} genetic conflict. However, one would expect severe effects on the condition of the colony if reproductive workers were left unchecked. For example, more time spent on individual reproduction would be predicted to detract from care of the queen's offspring. In studies of these ants, workers did actually display worker <b>policing,</b> as evidenced by increased aggression towards reproductive workers. Worker <b>policing</b> here is favored for group efficiency.|$|E
