30|$|There was no {{correlation}} {{that could be}} drawn from the frictional wear and surface roughness. A higher frictional value did not translate to higher roughness values. Aforementioned observations are anticipatory and are in agreement with various studies previously carried out [25 – 30]. This could be attributed to many reasons; one reason could be the <b>type</b> of <b>ligation.</b> Although the <b>type</b> of <b>ligation</b> was standardized using stainless steel ligatures, it could have been more uniformed, if a steady and predictable force system could be applied via a customized jig and load cell. This arrangement would have ensured uniform seating forces of the archwire into the bracket for all the samples.|$|R
30|$|Behavior of {{the forces}} {{released}} was significantly variable depending on the different <b>ligation</b> <b>types.</b> In 0.5  mm of deflection, {{it was observed that}} the EL promoted very low forces in all tests (Tables  3 to 4). This result probably occurred because the force exerted by the NiTi wires was hardly enough to overcome the friction generated by the ligatures. The EL pressures the wire inside the bracket slot, increasing the friction. In applying this concept in clinical practice, force values released by this <b>type</b> of <b>ligation</b> probably would not promote tooth movement.|$|R
30|$|The type of bracket (self-ligating or conventional), bracket {{construction}} material, {{size of the}} wire, <b>type</b> of <b>ligation,</b> and geometric {{differences in}} the brackets all have an influence on the frictional force. However, more research into lingual brackets is required, particularly to confirm that frictional force is not reduced when lingual self-ligating brackets are used.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} provide a {{comprehensive}} overview of the topic, {{we set out to}} evaluate the friction generated in both active and passive configurations of different lingual and labial brackets using plaster dental models, and to identify any correlation between frictional behavior and slot size, <b>type</b> of <b>ligation,</b> archwire diameter, bracket width, inter-bracket distance, and both first- and second-order critical contact angles.|$|R
30|$|In general, for the {{smallest}} amount of deflection (0.5  mm), {{there was a}} trend, in any diameter and type of wire tested, that the force exerted by EL were much smaller than those of other <b>ligation</b> <b>types.</b>|$|R
30|$|RSLT is {{frequently}} accompanied by intrahepatic vascular anomalies and anomalous biliary confluences [1, 2, 5]. However, no predictable correlation exists between portal vein anomalies and anomalous biliary confluences {{in patients with}} RSLT [5], {{despite the fact that}} vascular anomalies in RSLT livers have been thoroughly discussed and classified [1, 2, 5]. Moreover, we found that RSLT does not always coexist with left-sided gallbladder. Consequently, the vasculature and biliary structure should be surveyed carefully in preoperative imaging studies when RSLT is detected, {{even in the absence of}} left-sided gallbladder. Inattention to such anomalies before intervention can have life-threatening consequences. Because independent ramification of the right lateral portal pedicle is the most common RSLT <b>type,</b> <b>ligation</b> of the left trunk of the portal vein during hepatobiliary surgery will disrupt portal flow in the left two-thirds of the entire liver if the common trunk of the left portal vein and right paramedian pedicle is misinterpreted as the left portal vein [12]. Serious biliary complications during major hepatobiliary interventions in patients with RSLT have also been reported [13, 14]. The relationship between RSLT and biliary confluences may require further investigation and a redefinition. With the increasing popularity of 3 D MRCP, an extremely low-risk examination that requires no contrast medium injection and only a relatively short examination time, a better understanding of biliary confluences in RSLT livers can be achieved.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if the <b>type</b> of <b>ligation</b> influences the frictional resistance between stainless steel wire and brackets when the wire is subjected to repeated vertical displacements. Methods: Eight different <b>types</b> of <b>ligation</b> were used to secure a length of stainless steel wire in three stainless steel twin brackets. The wire was subjected to repeated vertical displacements in a simulated extraction space. Eighty per cent of the minimum force required to overcome static friction (F-m) between the wire and brackets {{was applied to the}} wire for eight minutes and any sliding measured. Results: Frictional resistance to sliding was least when stainless steel ligatures twisted in a figure 8 pattern until taut then untwisted one quarter turn were used, and greatest when elastomeric modules in a figure 8 pattern (EM 8) were used. The F-m difference between fully engaged standard and Super Slick elastomeric modules was significantly different (p = 0. 007). The frictional resistance to sliding fell when the wire was secured with either of these two methods and subjected to vertical displacement loads. There {{was no significant difference in}} the rate of wire movement between these modules. Conclusion: Repeated vertical displacement reduced the frictional resistance to sliding for all methods of ligation except EM 8. The stainless steel twist ligatures demonstrated the lowest frictional resistance to sliding. Nathawut Sirisaowaluk, Olena Kravchuk and Christopher T. C. Ho[URL]...|$|R

We have studied the implication of CD 53 antigen in signal transduction by determining the effect of its ligation on the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in different cell <b>types.</b> <b>Ligation</b> of the rat or human CD 53 antigen induces a three- to fourfold transient activation of JNKactivity that peaks at 3 ± 5 min. The effect was detected by assaying the endogenous or exogenous (transfected) JNKactivity. The JNK response was detected in IR 938 F cells, a rat B-cell lymphoma, and in Jurkat cells derived from a human T-cell lymphoma. This JNK activation was not mediated by the vav oncogene, and CD 53 does not cooperate with CD 3 for vav activation. Asimilar JNKactivation was also detected in a human renal carcinoma cell line that was transiently transfected with the human CD 53 cDNA to mimic the CD 53 ectopic expression in carcinomas. In stable CD 53 -transfected cells it stimulated Jun-dependent transcriptional activity. We conclude that parts of the cell responses modulated by the CD 53 are mediated by JNK activation, and this activation is independent of the different protein interactions that the CD 53 protein has on speci®c cell types.

30|$|Due to the {{influence}} of the ligation methods in the force exerted on the teeth and to the extensive variation of them in the market, further studies become essential to evaluate the behavior of each wire/bracket combination. This way, the aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the forces exerted by conventional and thermally activated NiTi wires in different <b>ligation</b> <b>types,</b> in SLB and conventional brackets (CB).|$|R
30|$|The wire can be ligated to the bracket {{by means}} of metal {{ligature}} (ML) of different diameters, elastomeric ligature (EL), or by the specific closure system {{in the case of}} self-ligating brackets (SLB) [13]. Among the EL, the most common way to tie is the “ring” shape. Another tying option with elastomeric ligatures is the “figure 8 ” shape, which promotes greater pressure of the wire in the slot, increasing friction [14 – 17]. EL properties include light continuous force, consistent long-lasting seating archwire, resistance to water sorption, and shape memory [13]. Furthermore, they can be applied quickly, are comfortable for the patient, and have a variety of colors. However, the EL allows greater microbial accumulation {{on the surface of the}} teeth adjacent to the bracket, compared to the other <b>ligation</b> <b>types,</b> besides the fact that the archwires may not completely seat during torquing or rotational corrections, and binding may occur with sliding mechanics [13, 18 – 20]. Few studies have evaluated the influence of the <b>ligation</b> <b>type</b> in the force exerted by the wire on the tooth [6, 11, 12].|$|R

40|$|CD 40, a tumor {{necrosis}} factor receptor superfamily member, is up-regulated on intraheptatic endothelial cells (IHEC) and {{epithelial cells}} during inflammatory liver disease, {{and there is}} evidence that the functional outcome of CD 40 ligation differs between cell <b>types.</b> <b>Ligation</b> of CD 40 on cholangiocytes or hepatocytes results in induction of Fas-mediated apoptosis, whereas ligation of IHEC CD 40 leads to enhanced chemokine secretion and adhesion molecule expression. We now report that differential activation of two transcription factors, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein- 1 (AP- 1), in primary human hepatocytes or IHEC, is associated with and may explain, in part, the different responses of these cell types to CD 40 ligation. CD 40 ligation induced a rise in NF-κB activity in hepatocytes,which peaked at 2 h and returned to baseline by 24 h; however, IHEC CD 40 ligation resulted in a sustained up-regulation of NF-κB (> 24 h). In hepatocytes, CD 40 ligation led to sustained up-regulation of AP- 1 activity > 24 h associated with increased protein levels of RelA (p 65), c-Jun, and c-Fos, whereas no induction of AP- 1 activity was observed in IHECs. Analysis of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation (phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 and phospho-c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase 1 / 2) and expression of inhibitor κBα were entirely consistent, and thus confirmed the profiles of NF-κB and AP- 1 signaling and the effects of the selective inhibitors assessed using electrophoretic mobility shift assay or Western immunoblotting. CD 40 ligation resulted in induction of apoptosis in hepatocytes after 24 h, but on IHECs, CD 40 ligation resulted in proliferation. Inhibition of (CD 40 -mediated) NF-κB activation prevented IHEC proliferation and led to induction of apoptosis. Selective extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase inhibitors reduced levels of apoptosis in (CD 40 -stimulated) hepatocytes by ∼ 50 %. We conclude that differential activation of these two transcription factors in response to CD 40 ligation is associated with differences in cell fate. Transient activation of NF-κB and sustained AP- 1 activation is associated with apoptosis in hepatocytes, whereas prolonged NF-κB activation and a lack of AP- 1 activation in IHECs result in proliferation...|$|R

40|$|Our aim in {{this study}} was to compare conventional, active self-ligating and passive self-ligating {{mechanisms}} using first order archwire deflections. A cantilever and three point bend model were used to assess degree of bracket play, deactivation force, and superelastic range. Methods: We studied five different bracket types: victoryTM(3 M-Unitek, St. Paul, MN), smartClipTM(3 M-Unitek, St. Paul, MN), Damon hYTM(rmc oG, lendora, CA), CarriereTM(Ortho Organizers, Carlsbad, CA) and In- Ovation R (GAC Intl., Bohemia, NY). These brackets were tested with round superelastic nickel titanium wires varying in diameter: 0. 0142 ̆ 2, 0. 0162 ̆ 2, 0. 0182 ̆ 2 and 0. 0202 ̆ 2 (Ultimate Wireforms Inc., Bristol, CT). Using a mechanical testing apparatus with custom fixture we recorded the load-deflection curve generated by the deflected archwire over a span of 4 mm. The wire was deflected at a rate of 10 mmImin and measurements were taken at a rate of 20 Hz. Data was compared and analyzed using a single factor ANOVA with the bracket type as the discriminating variable. Group differences were further analyzed using post-hoc T-tests (a = 0. 01). Results: Bracket play was significant for both wire diameters (p 50. 01). The 0. 0142 ̆ 2 wire showed significantly less play with the Victory and In-Ovation R brackets when compared to the passive self ligating brackets (PSLBs). For PSLBs, the Smartclip bracket had significantly less bracket play than the Damon MX and Carriere, which were not significantly different. Both the ligation mechanism and the archwire diameter had a significant effect on deactivation load. Victory and In-Ovation R brackets provided a measurable deactivation load at lmm, while the PSLBs provided no such force with the 0. 0142 ̆ 2 wire. During the cantilever test, PSLBs produced the lowest deactivation forces for all wires tested. The three point bend test showed similar results with small diameter wires. As the degree of deflection and archwire diameter increased, the PSLBs displayed reduced deactivation forces, which are related to significant binding and increased sliding frictional resistance. The superelastic range varied significantly for the various bracket types (p_ 3 ̆c 0. 01). Victory provided the largest superelastic range for all wires except the 0. 0202 ̆ 2. Of the SLBs tested, In-Ovation R displayed the larger superelastic range. The 0. 014, 2 ̆ 2 test showed a significant difference in superelastic range for all brackets except the Damon MX and Carriere, which were not significantly different from each other.

After chemical oxidation of Cyt b- 559 by 10 mM 2, 3 -dicyano, 4, 5 -dichloro-p-benzoquinone (DDQ) the major part of Cyt b- 559 {{is found to be}} present in the high spin Fe(III) form. Only a small fraction of low spin heme Fe(III) (less than 5 %) was formed by chemical or light-induced oxidation. This fraction increased during aging of intact chloroplasts. A comparison with the EPR signal of Fe(III) in myoglobin (Mb) reveals that the structure of the high spin signal in intact chloroplasts is indicative for the presence of an axial OH− ligand at the heme Fe(III). This <b>type</b> of <b>ligation</b> comprised a considerable part (∼ 40 %) of the total Cyt b- 559 content. Removal of the Mn-claster caused a change of the EPR parameters of OH− ligation. When in intact chloroplasts the heme Fe is chemically oxidized to FE (III) ligated by OH−, this OH− ligation disappeared after a subsequent illumination at 80 K by red light. Upon illumination at 140 K this disappearance was accompanied by the formation of a high spin Fe(III) that is not ligated by OH−. These results are discussed in terms of removal of OH− from Fe(III) caused by structural changes or photooxidafion at a complex of Cyt b- 559 that could possibly also comprise the Mn-cluster. This photooxidation is assumed to be accompanied by the formation of a bound OH• radical. The possibility is discussed that this process is related to photosynthetic water oxidation...|$|R

The jig with this assembly was mounted on the Instron machine with the cross head moving upwards at a speed of 5 mm/min. The movable bracket was suspended from the load cell of the testing machine, while the jig was mounted on cross head of machine and the load cell readings were recorded on digital display.

The brackets used were 0. 022 slot Damon, 0. 022 Smart clip and 0. 022 slot MBT system. RESULTS: Self ligating brackets were shown to produce lesser friction when compared to the conventional brackets used with modules, and stainless steel ligatures. Damon self-ligating brackets produce a least friction of all the brackets used in the study. Stainless steel ligatures produced the least friction compared to elastomeric. CONCLUSION: Self ligation brackets produce lesser friction than the conventional brackets ligated with elastomeric modules and stainless steel ligature. Damon self-ligating brackets produce a least friction of all the brackets used in the study width of the bracket was also found to be directly proportional to the friction produced 0. 0016 HANT with elastomeric modules produce more friction due increase in flexibility of wire. ...|$|R

In the current report, we explore the relationship between integrin- mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and gene induction in human monocytes. We demonstrate that monocyte adherence to tissue culture dishes or to extracellular matrix proteins is followed by a rapid and profound increase in tyrosine phosphorylation, with the predominant phosphorylated component being a protein of 76 kD (pp 76). Tyrosine phosphorylation of pp 76 and other monocyte proteins can also be triggered by incubation of monocytes with antibodies to the integrin beta 1 subunit, or by F(ab') 2 fragments of such antibodies, but not by F(ab) fragments. The ligation of beta 1 integrins with antibodies or F(ab') 2 fragments also induces the expression of immediate-early (IE) genes such as IL- 1 beta. When adhering monocytes are treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein or herbimycin, both phosphorylation of pp 76 and induction of IL- 1 beta message are blocked in a dose-dependent fashion. Similarly, treatment with genistein or herbimycin can block tyrosine phosphorylation of pp 76 and IL- 1 beta message induction mediated by ligation of beta 1 integrin with antibodies. These observations suggest that protein tyrosine phosphorylation is an important aspect of integrin-mediated IE gene induction in monocytes.

A clinical simulation device was created especially for this study and forces were measured with an Instron Universal Testing Machine. For the testing procedure, the block representing the maxillary right central incisor was moved 0. 5 and 1 mm bucco-lingually at a constant speed of 2 mm/min, and the forces released by the wires were recorded, in accordance with the ISO 15841 guidelines. In general, the RSEL showed lighter forces, while 8 SEL and ML showed higher values. At the 0. 5 mm deflection, the 8 SEL presented the greatest force, but at the 1. 0 mm deflection the ML had a statistically similar force. Based on our evaluations, to obtain lighter forces, the thermally activated nickel-titanium wire with the RSEL are recommended, while the steel wire with the 8 SEL or the ML are recommended when larger forces are desired.

The latter subpopulation displayed high binding capacity for Annexin V, showed a hypodiploid peak, electrophoretic DNA fragmentation, and morphological features of apo-ptotic cells. The addition of drugs known to delay apoptosis (GM-CSF or cAMP) resulted in a reduc-tion of Class I modulation. Furthermore, ligation of surface Class I with F(ab*) 2 fragments of the anti-Class I mAb W 6 / 32 resulted in a delay in the progression of apoptosis. These data indicate that this surface Class I molecule is a marker of age-related apoptosis, and the ligation of these mole-cules results in the transduction of a signal that inhibits apoptosis. Thus, the downregulation of HLA Class I molecules in aging neutrophils pre-vents their halting the apoptotic process. J. Leu-koc. Biol. 68 : 873 – 880; 2000.

In that study, microcosm plaque biofilms were grown in 24 -well microplates on enamel discs for 14 days in artificial saliva. Growth condition comprised cariogenic challenge. The groups (n= 10 per group) were: self-ligating brackets (SL); conventional brackets ligated with stainless steel wires (CW); conventional brackets (CE), brackets with hooks (HE), ceramic brackets (KE), and composite brackets (RE), all the four ligated with elastomeric rings. The biofilm formed around the brackets was collected and dry-weighted and the mineral loss around the brackets was determined by cross-sectional microhardness. The third study evaluated in situ the combinated effect of types of brackets and archwire ligation on enamel demineralization, on the accumulation and on microbiological composition of dental plaque. The study design was a modified in situ model, randomized, double-blind and split-mouth. Volunteers (n= 17) wore palatal removable appliances containing enamel discs with bonded orthodontic brackets during 14 days. To provide cariogenic challenge, 20 % sucrose solution was dripped 8 x/day onto each disc. The four conditions under study were: CE; CW; HE; and SL. The biofilm formed around the brackets was collected for microbiological analyses and the mineral loss was determined by cross-sectional microhardness measurement. The systematic review results showed contradictions among studies, and a great methodology variation among them. The reviewed papers did not allow any conclusion {{about the effect of}} types of brackets and ligatures on caries lesions and biofilm accumulation. No differences were observed in vitro or in situ regarding biofilm biomass (P> 0. 05), except for the HE group wich presented lower biofilm accumulation in vitro (P 0, 05), exceto para o grupo GE, o qual apresentou menor acúmulo de biofilme in vitro (P< 0, 05). Menor desmineralização foi observada associada à bráquetes autoligantes (P< 0, 05). Bráquetes com um desenho mais complexo promovem maior desmineralização do que os autoligantes (P< 0, 05). Os métodos de ligadura também afetaram a desmineralização, e anéis elastoméricos promovem lesões de cárie do que amarrilhos de aço (P< 0, 05) ...|$|R

40|$|As {{stated in}} Part I, the writer {{has found the}} {{difference}} of the water content among various kinds of brain edema. Therefore, the minerals in the cortex were investigated. For the measurement of natrium (Na) and potassium (K), Rourke iodine method and Kramer-Tisdall oxydation method were used after wet ashing. For chlorine (Cl), the extract of the cortex with saturated picric acid was investigated with the method described by Schales and Schales. In the cases of brain edema of edematous <b>type</b> caused by <b>ligation</b> of the bilateral jugular veins, injection of destilled water into the carotid artery and experimental commotio cerebri, Na and Cl increased and K decreased. The increase of Na and Cl was most striking in those with injection of destilled water into the carotid artery, then in those with commotio cerebri, and less in those with ligation of the jugular veins. Thus the change of Na and Cl was parallel {{to that of the}} water content. The decrease of K was most striking in those with ligation of the jugular veins and injection of destilled water into the carotid artery, and less in those with commotio cerebri, thus inverse to the change of the water content. All of Na, Cl and K decreased in the cases of brain edema of swelling type caused by irrigation of warm physiologic saline solution upon the surface of brain. In the cases with experimental chronic internal hydrocephalus, there was almost no change of Na, Cl and K...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the roles of different Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) -induced and ligature-induced experimental periodontal bone resorption in mice. Wild-type (WT), TLR 2 knockout (KO), TLR 4 KO, and TLR 2 & 4 KO mice with C 57 /BL 6 background were divided into three groups: control, P. gingivalis infection, and ligation. Live P. gingivalis or silk ligatures were placed in the sulcus around maxillary second molars over a 2 -week period. Images were captured by digital stereomicroscopy, and the bone resorption area was measured with ImageJ software. The protein expression level of gingival RANKL was measured by ELISA. The gingival mRNA levels of RANKL, IL- 1 β, TNF-α, and IL- 10 were detected by RT-qPCR. The results showed that P. gingivalis induced significant periodontal bone resorption in WT mice and TLR 2 KO mice but not in TLR 4 KO mice or TLR 2 & 4 KO mice. For all four <b>types</b> of mice, <b>ligation</b> induced significant bone loss compared with that in control groups, and this bone loss was significantly higher than that in the P. gingivalis infection group. RANKL protein expression was significantly increased in the ligation group compared with that in the control group for all four types of mice, and in the P. gingivalis infection group of WT, TLR 2 KO, and TLR 4 KO mice. Expression patterns of RANKL, IL- 1 β, TNF-α, and IL- 10 mRNA were different in the P. gingivalis infection group and the ligation group in different types of mice. In summary, P. gingivalis-induced periodontal bone resorption is TLR 4 -dependent, whereas ligation-induced periodontal bone resorption is neither TLR 2 - nor TLR 4 -dependent...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of elastomeric type and stainless steel (SS) ligation on frictional resistance using a validated method. To assess the validity of the new test system to measure mean frictional forces, SS and TMA wires, each with dimensions of 0. 017 x 0. 025 and 0. 019 x 0. 025 inches, were used in combination with a self-ligating Damon II bracket or a conventional preadjusted edgewise premolar SS bracket without <b>ligation.</b> Four <b>types</b> of elastomeric module, purple, grey, Alastik or SuperSlick, and a pre-formed 0. 09 inch SS ligature were then assessed as methods of ligation using preadjusted edgewise premolar SS brackets. The specimens were tested on a Nene M 3000 testing machine, with a crosshead speed of 5 mm/minute and each test run lasted for 4 minutes. Each bracket/wire combination with each method of ligation was tested 10 times in the presence of human saliva and the mean frictional force was recorded. The mean frictional forces were compared using three-way analysis of variance. The Damon II self-ligating bracket and unligated conventional SS bracket produced negligible mean frictional forces with any of the wires tested. For the 0. 017 x 0. 025 SS, 0. 019 x 0. 025 SS or 0. 019 x 0. 025 inch TMA wires, SS ligatures produced the lowest mean frictional forces. With the 0. 017 x 0. 025 TMA wire, purple modules produced the lowest mean frictional force. There was no consistent pattern in the mean frictional forces across the various combinations of wire <b>type,</b> size and <b>ligation</b> method. Under the conditions of this experiment, the use of passive self-ligating brackets is the only method of almost eliminating friction. © European Orthodontic Society 2004; all rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
