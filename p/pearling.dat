5|$|From the 1850s locals were {{recruitment}} {{targets to}} leave the island {{to be involved with}} bêche-de-mer and <b>pearling</b> enterprises with Europeans and Japanese.|$|E
5|$|According to Ibn Batuta, a {{traveling}} Moroccan historian of note, by 1344, the kingdom had two capitals: one in Nallur {{in the north}} and the other in Puttalam in the west during the <b>pearling</b> season.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{population}} had been reduced to about 50. In 1909 the Chief Protector of Aborigines visited the Island, apparently to check on the activities of Japanese <b>pearling</b> crews in the area, and reported the existence of a small camp of Aborigines.|$|E
5|$|The temple has {{historically}} {{been associated with the}} nearby <b>pearling</b> and fishing town of Chilaw, as well as the landed gentry of the surrounding villages who provided the resources to maintain the temple. Proximity to the trading routes and to the port provided an opportunity for transmission of ideas and people from India to Sri Lanka. The Pattuva has many temples dedicated to the higher echelons of Hindu or Buddhist deities, and to village guardian deities such Ayyanar or Ayyanayake, Viramunda, Kadavara and Bandara. Anthropologist Rohan Bastin speculates that the main Siva temple was once a minor shrine dedicated to village guardian deity Munisvaran that was transformed into a major Siva temple due to royal patronage. The temple was already an established temple by the 11th century CE, as it had issued coins by then. The temple began under the patronage of Pattuva chiefs and was probably constructed during {{the early part of the}} 10th century CE. A ferry transported traders, pilgrims and chroniclers such as Ibn Battuta from Tenavaram temple, Tevan Thurai to the Chera and Chola kingdoms of Tamilakam, stopping at Puttalam of the Jaffna kingdom and sailing the Gulf of Mannar during the 14th century CE.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{program has}} been {{undertaken}} by Paspaley <b>Pearling</b> in combination with Aeronautical Engineers Australia to fit new engines and modernize its Mallard fleet, {{which is used to}} support its <b>pearling</b> operations in Northern Australia. The fleet has been extensively rebuilt and also refitted with PT6A turbines, and is currently undergoing a life extension program.|$|E
25|$|Zubarah was {{primarily}} an emporium and <b>pearling</b> settlement that capitalized on {{its proximity to}} pearl beds, possession of a large harbour and its central position on the Gulf routes. Its economy depended on the pearl diving season, which {{took place during the}} long summer months. <b>Pearling</b> would draw Bedouin from the interior of Qatar as well as the {{people from all over the}} Persian Gulf to dive, trade and safeguard the town from attack while the town’s men were at sea.|$|E
25|$|The archaeological {{evidence}} for <b>pearling</b> on site comes {{primarily from the}} tools used by the divers such, as pearl boxes, diving weights, and small measuring weights used during trading.|$|E
25|$|On 12 December 1951, Cootamundra was re-commissioned as a {{training}} ship. In 1954, the corvette visited New Zealand. In 1957, she {{was assigned to}} northern Australian waters, to supervise the Japanese <b>pearling</b> fleet.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, the <b>pearling</b> {{industry}} thrived, providing both income and employment {{to the people}} of the Persian Gulf. The First World War had a severe impact on the industry, but it was the economic depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the invention of the cultured pearl, that wiped out the trade. The remnants of the trade eventually faded away shortly after the Second World War, when the newly independent Government of India imposed heavy taxation on pearls imported from the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. The decline of <b>pearling</b> resulted in extreme economic hardship in the Trucial States.|$|E
25|$|In 637, Julfar (today Ras al-Khaimah) {{was used}} as a staging post for the conquest of Iran. Over many centuries, Julfar became a wealthy port and <b>pearling</b> center from which dhows {{traveled}} throughout the Indian Ocean.|$|E
25|$|During the 1870s, Muslim Malay divers were {{recruited}} through {{an agreement with}} the Dutch to work on Western Australian and Northern Territory <b>pearling</b> grounds. By 1875, there were 1800 Malay divers working in Western Australia. Most returned to their home countries.|$|E
25|$|During {{the nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries, the <b>pearling</b> {{industry}} thrived in the relative calm at sea, providing both income and employment {{to the people of the}} Persian Gulf. It began to become a good economic resource for the local people. The First World War had a severe impact on the pearl fishery, but it was the Great Depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the Japanese invention of the cultured pearl, that all but destroyed it. The industry eventually faded away shortly after the Second World War, when the newly independent Government of India imposed heavy taxation on pearls imported from the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. The decline of <b>pearling</b> resulted in a very difficult era, with little opportunity to build any infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, Japan {{established}} {{its first}} Australian consulate in Townsville, primarily to serve some 4,000Japanese workers who migrated {{to work in}} the sugar cane, turtle, trochus, beche de mer and <b>pearling</b> industries. With the introduction of the White Australia policy, the demand for Japanese workers decreased, causing the consulate to finally close in 1908.|$|E
25|$|From the 1870s, Indonesians were {{recruited}} {{to work in}} the <b>pearling</b> and sugar cane industries in northern Australia. Around 1,000 Indonesians were living in Australia by Federation in 1901, almost all in Queensland and Western Australia. With the introduction of the White Australia Policy at this time, most sugar workers returned to Indonesia, although some pearl divers remained.|$|E
25|$|On June 22, 2013, UNESCO {{added the}} site to its World Heritage List. The UNESCO report stated that the town was {{distinguished}} its degree of preservation and its evidenced sustainment by pearl diving and commerce. Following its inclusion in the list, the partially restored fort {{was transformed into a}} visitor centre and a number of rooms were designated for showcasing the subjects of <b>pearling</b> and astronomy.|$|E
25|$|Zubarah was {{the focal}} point of an {{extensive}} regional trade network during its peak in the late eighteenth century. Until the introduction of the cultured pearl in the early 1900s, the trade in pearls constituted the Persian Gulf’s most important industry, employing up to a third of the male population in the region. Zubarah, being one of the focal <b>pearling</b> and trading towns, contributed to the geopolitical, social, and cultural trajectories of Gulf history which shape the region today.|$|E
25|$|Abu Dhabi {{worked in}} the pearl {{business}} and traded with others. According to a source about <b>pearling,</b> the Persian Gulf was the best location for pearls. Pearl divers dove for one to one-and-a-half minutes, and would have dived up to thirty times per day. There were no air tanks and any other sort of mechanical device was forbidden. The divers had a leather nose clip and leather coverings on their fingers and big toes to protect them while they searched for oysters. The divers were not paid for a day’s work but received {{a portion of the}} season’s earnings.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Frazer {{had been}} {{operating}} with John Bell {{for a number}} of years and on 11 April 1875, he was operating a <b>pearling</b> boat, for the John Bell, and based at Jervis Island (now Mabuiag Island) in the Torres Strait, he was anchored off Night Island (Queensland) and some men were sent ashore to find water. The landing party came across a group of Aborigines accompanied by a white man and reported the encounter to the captain. Joseph Frazer sent his men back with some things to barter in exchange for the white man. It was found that Narcisse Pelletier had been a castaway for 17 years.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, {{the first}} oil company teams carried out {{preliminary}} surveys. An onshore concession was granted to Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) in 1939, and an offshore concession to D'Arcy Exploration Ltd in 1952. Oil was discovered under an old <b>pearling</b> {{bed in the}} Persian Gulf, Umm Shaif, in 1958, and in the desert at Murban in 1960. The first cargo of crude was exported from Jabel Dhanna in Abu Dhabi in 1962. As oil revenues increased, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, undertook a massive construction program, building schools, housing, hospitals and roads. When Dubai's oil exports commenced in 1969, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, was also able to use oil revenues to improve his people's quality of life.|$|E
25|$|After recommissioning, Quadrants {{service was}} mainly in Australian waters. Quadrant escorted the Royal Yacht Gothic during {{the visit to}} Australia of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh in February 1954. Quadrant visited New Guinea, Manus, and New Britain in October 1954, New Zealand in March 1955, and spent a period on {{exercises}} in Far East waters in June 1955. In March 1956, she took part in exercises in Malayan waters. During June 1956 she served for a period as a surveillance vessel with the Japanese <b>pearling</b> fleet in the Arafura Sea. In October 1956, Quadrant again proceeded to the Far East for further exercises, visiting Hong Kong, Singapore, and Manila. By 1957 the frigate was already worn out and the decision to decommission the vessel was made before sister ship HMAS Quiberon's frigate conversion was complete and after the premature decommissioning HMAS Quality due to hull failure.|$|E
25|$|In the Kimberley region, {{there was}} minor damage to some {{buildings}} at Kalumburu and water {{level in the}} river rose to within 50metres (165ft) of the town. The BHP facilities at Troughton Island were affected by very destructive winds and heavy rainfall from the cyclone's core, damaging the runway and buildings. Average wind speeds of 139km/h (86mph) and a maximum gust of 174km/h (108mph) were recorded before communications were lost. Only minor damage was received at the <b>pearling</b> facilities at Vansittart Bay and Kuri Bay, mainly to floating pontoons. A number of places reported daily rainfall totals in excess of 100mm (3.9inches) including 223mm (8.78in) in Kalumburu on 11 December, and 174mm (6.85in) in Ellendake on 13 December. McGowan Island, {{to the north of}} Kalumburu received 490mm (19.3in) of rain between 9 December and 13 December. Parts of east Pilbara also reported heavy rains over several days. Marble Bar recorded 239mm (9.4in) and Newman recorded 175mm (6.89in) in a two-day period.|$|E
25|$|Primarily in {{reaction}} to the ambitions of other European countries, namely France and Russia, the British and the Trucial Sheikhdoms established closer bonds in an 1892 treaty, similar to treaties entered into by the British with other Persian Gulf principalities. The sheikhs agreed not to dispose of any territory except to the British and not to enter into relationships with any foreign government other than the British without their consent. In return, the British promised to protect the Trucial Coast from all aggression by sea and to help in case of land attack. This treaty, the Exclusive Agreement, was signed by the Rulers of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Ras Al Khaimah and Umm Al Quwain between 6 and 8 March 1892. It was subsequently ratified by the Viceroy of India and the British Government in London. British maritime policing meant that <b>pearling</b> fleets could operate in relative security. However, the British prohibition of the slave trade meant an important source of income was lost to some sheikhs and merchants. The charge of piracy is disputed by modern Emirati historians, including the current Ruler of Sharjah in his 1986 book The Myth of Arab Piracy in the Gulf.|$|E
500|$|Subsequently, the Park Authority {{refused to}} extend the pearl farming permits and Crimp took action before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to have this {{decision}} reversed. [...] On 15 March 2004 the Tribunal agreed that the permits should be terminated but allowed the existing <b>pearling</b> operations to continue to 1 December 2005. [...] This decision was substantially upheld by the Federal Court on 21 October 2004.|$|E

2500|$|Pearl divers {{near the}} Philippines were also {{successful}} at harvesting large pearls, {{especially in the}} Sulu Archipelago. [...] At times, the largest pearls belonged by law to the sultan, and selling them {{could result in the}} death penalty for the seller. [...] Nonetheless, many pearls made it out of the archipelago by stealth, ending up in the possession of the wealthiest families in Europe. <b>Pearling</b> was popular in Qatar, Bahrain, Japan, and India. The Gulf of Mexico was also known for <b>pearling.</b>|$|E

2500|$|As well {{as being}} a {{shipwright}} and publican, John Bell ran a <b>pearling</b> station utilising south sea divers at Jarvis Island (now Mabuiag Island) which had been established in 1871 and by the mid 1870s was running 4 foot pumped dive boats and 5 free swimming dive boats and employing about 100 men in the Torres Strait ...|$|E
2500|$|The Victoria Hotel lost part of {{its roof}} and was damaged {{internally}} during a cyclone on 6 January 1897. Known as the [...] "Great Hurricane", it killed 28 people, sank 19 vessels in the harbour including the entire <b>pearling</b> fleet, and caused around £150,000 damage throughout the town. Structurally however, the hotel {{was one of only}} a few buildings that remained intact and it was repaired shortly afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|Abu Dhabi has {{a diverse}} and {{multicultural}} society. The city's cultural imprint as a small, ethnically homogeneous <b>pearling</b> community was {{changed with the}} arrival of other ethnic groups and nationals—first by the Iranians in the early 1900s, and later by various Asian and European ethnicities in the 1950s and 60s. Abu Dhabi has been criticised for perpetuating a class-based society, where migrant workers are in the lower classes, and suffer abuse which [...] "is endemic to the system". Major holidays in Abu Dhabi include Eid al Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, Eid ul-Adha which marks the end of Hajj, and National Day (2 December), which marks the formation of the United Arab Emirates.|$|E
2500|$|In 1872, as an {{engineer}}, he sailed on the Maria on {{a voyage}} to New Guinea but {{the ship was}} wrecked. In 1875, he again sailed as an engineer on William John Macleay's expedition to the Gulf of Papua. From October 1875 to January 1876 he was exploring the hinterland of Port Moresby under Octavius Stone, and in April 1876 went on another expedition under Luigi D'Albertis for over 400 miles up the Fly River on the SS Ellengowan. In 1877 he was inspecting the newly developing <b>pearling</b> industry for Parbury Lamb and Co. [...] He returned to Sydney, joined the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1877, and in 1878 became an assistant astronomical observer at Sydney Observatory. He held this position for about five years, retired in 1883 with a moderate competency, and gave {{the rest of his}} life to research work.|$|E
2500|$|Countries in the Persian Gulf {{region have}} had a {{long-established}} economic and political link with India. Trucial Oman (now UAE), was nominally independent in the 19th century but was administered by the British Raj; trade and banking sectors in the territory were administered by the Khoja and Kutchi communities of India. In 1853, the rulers of the emirates signed a Perpetual Maritime Truce with the British, effectively bringing the region under Britain's sphere of influence. Administered from British India, the emirates developed commonalities with South Asia. Indian Rupees were used as currency, as were Indian stamps (overlaid {{with the name of}} the emirate) for postal correspondence. A fairly homogeneous society {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, the region that now comprises the UAE experienced an economic boom as a result of the <b>pearling</b> industry; the few Indian traders emigrating to the emirates moved to the coastal towns and remained on the fringes of Emirati society. Dubai had traditionally served as an entrepôt for trade between the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent and was dominated by Hindu merchants in both gold and textile trade. Dubai was also an important trading post for Indians prior to the discovery of oil (in commercial quantities) in the UAE in 1959; [...] the emirate had been at the centre of a smuggling route of gold to India via small boats, where the importation of gold was illegal.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{incumbent}} was Garnet Eric Shaw, {{a graduate}} of the University of Melbourne, taking his BA while resident at Trinity College, and then completing his theological training through St John's College (ThL). He was ordained as a priest in 1911 and appointed as the first Anglican chaplain to the Australian Navy in 1912. [...] Shaw was well accustomed to life at sea, having previously worked extensively in the <b>pearling</b> industry, and holding both a mate's and a master's mariner certificates. [...] He resigned from the Navy because he objected to compulsory attendance at divine service for naval personnel, which was at odds with Navy policy at that time. [...] After the outbreak of the Great War, he decided to resign from the parish and enlisted for active service. It was reported {{at the time that he}} did not intend to return to ministry after the war, defending his position that [...] "though the Church [...] right in its principles, it [...] not always follow its principles into practice". [...] Shaw survived the war, having been accepted for officer training and active service in France, and eventually being appointed a chaplain in the AIF. [...] After the war he returned to parish life: his war service records indicate that in applying for his service medals (British War Medal, and Victory Medal) he was the incumbent of All Soul's South Sassafras (Kallista) in 1924.|$|E
