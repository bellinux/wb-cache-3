25|$|Balian of Ibelin and the archbishops of Tyre and Nazareth {{arrived at}} Tiberias the {{following}} day. Ernoulwho was present as Ibelin's squirewrote {{that the news}} about the crusaders' catastrophe {{came as a shock}} for Raymond. He soon agreed to <b>personally</b> <b>do</b> homage to Guy. He also expelled the Muslim garrison which had been stationing in Tiberias since he made an alliance with Saladin. According to Ali ibn al-Athir, Raymond agreed {{to come to terms with}} the king only after his vassals threatened him with disobedience, and the prelates also announced that they were ready to excommunicate him and to declare his marriage void. Raymond and the king met near Jerusalem, at Fort St Job, which was held by the Hospitallers. After they both dismounted, Raymond did homage to the king on his knees. Guy soon lifted him up and expressed regret for his irregular coronation, according to Ernoul.|$|E

There he said he told a producer, [...] "I don't know why you hired me, because you haven't given me anything. I just don't think this stuff's going to be good". He also said he felt [...] "kind of trapped in that material" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "no way out". He also admitted to a post-ceremony fight on Twitter with longtime Oscars writer Bruce Vilanch. When Vilanch intimated that the busy actor appeared less than fully committed to the job, Franco posted a photo {{of the two of them}} together graffiti-ed saying [...] "James Fucked up the oscars. Trust me, I KNOW comedy. I mean, come on, I write for Bette Midler". Franco explained to Playboy that [...] "I <b>personally</b> <b>do</b> not do my best thinking when I'm angry. Before Twitter, I always had that buffer period when I could actually think and decide, Is this worth it? ... For me Twitter is a dangerous thing".|$|E

2500|$|I {{think that}} {{that ought to be}} left up to the states. I <b>personally</b> <b>do</b> not {{think that that}} is a good idea, but I believe in many of these cases where there's real dispute in the country, these things {{are not going to be}} ever resolved. [...] People are going to have {{different}} ideas. That's why we have states. We ought to give great leeway to states and not have the federal government and not have the Supreme Court of the United States making social policy that's contrary to the traditions of this country and changing that overnight. And that's what's happened in a lot of these areas.|$|E
2500|$|The Court told four {{students}} to consider applying for admission {{in a year}} or more. Initially Lowell opposed all such applications. Greenough expressed frustration with his stance and eventually won readmission for Gilkey and Lumbard. He expressed especial frustration that Lowell would not readmit Day. Informing Day that he could not return to Harvard, Greenough could only offer personal reflections and assurances: [...] "Two points, however, I beg you to bear in mind. First, the chief thing in this world is to do right and be of service, whether at Harvard or outside. I know that you will keep on trying wherever you are. Secondly, please remember that if there is ever anything I can <b>personally</b> <b>do</b> to help you, I shall be glad to know it and to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Orville {{began by}} {{questioning}} why the Bridgeport Herald [...] "withheld" [...] such important aeronautical news {{four days and}} suggested the story thus must not be true. Whitehead researchers {{have pointed out that}} the Herald was not a daily newspaper but a weekly, published only on Sundays. Orville noted that James Dickie, named as a witness by the Herald, had declared in an affidavit that he was not present at the event, did not know the other named witness and never saw a Whitehead aircraft fly. Orville discussed John J. Dvorak, a physics professor at Washington University in St. Louis, who had designed an engine and hired Whitehead to build it after praising him publicly. Dvorak became dissatisfied with Whitehead's progress on the engine and severed the business relationship. Orville quoted Dvorak's 1936 affidavit: [...] "I <b>personally</b> <b>do</b> not believe that Whitehead ever succeeded in making any airplane flights." [...] Dvorak's negative comments that Orville quoted included the phrases: [...] "Whitehead did not possess sufficient mechanical skill...was given to gross exaggeration...He had delusions." ...|$|E

2500|$|No {{matter what}} the {{demographic}} or contextual influences are on a student who decides to engage in cheating behavior, before they can cheat they must overcome their own conscience. This depends both on how strongly someone disapproves of academic dishonesty and what types of justifications the student uses to escape a sense of guilt. For instance, students who <b>personally</b> <b>do</b> not have a moral problem with academic misconduct can cheat guilt-free. However, while many students have been taught and have internalized that academic dishonesty is wrong, {{it has been shown}} that on average a third of students who strongly disapprove of cheating have in fact cheated. [...] People who cheat despite personal disapproval of cheating engage in something called [...] "neutralization", in which a student rationalizes the cheating as being acceptable due to certain mitigating circumstances. According to psychologists of deviant behavior, people who engage in neutralization support the societal norm in question, but [...] "conjure up" [...] reasons why they are allowed to violate that norm in a particular case. [...] Neutralization is not a simple case of ex post facto rationalization, but is rather a more comprehensive affair, occurring before, during, and after the act of cheating. [...] Researchers have found four major types of neutralization of academic dishonesty, which they categorize by type of justification. [...] Denial of responsibility – that is, the accusation that others are to blame or that something forced the student to cheat – is the most common form of neutralization among college students who cheated, with 61% of cheaters using this form of justification. [...] Condemnation of condemner – that is, that the professors are hypocrites or brought it on themselves – is the second most common form of college student neutralization at 28%. [...] The third most popular form of neutralization among college students is the appeal to higher loyalties, where the student thinks their responsibility to some other entity, usually their peers, is more important than doing what they know to be morally right. About 6.8% of cheaters in higher education use this form of neutralization. Denial of injury – thinking that nobody is worse off for the cheating – is the fourth most popular kind of neutralization at 4.2% of cheaters.|$|E

I <b>personally</b> <b>do</b> not feel so very certain about it. He who reads must find out for himself. My intention in writing Falk was not to shock anybody. As in most of my writings I insist not on the events but on their effect upon the persons in the tale. But in everything I have written there is always one invariable intention, and that is to capture the reader's attention, by securing his interest and enlisting his sympathies for the matter in hand, whatever it may be, within the limits of the visible world and within the boundaries of human emotions.|$|E
60|$|Do {{you think}} you are right to send Macaire and the Admiral about? Not a copy have I sent, nor (speaking for myself <b>personally)</b> <b>do</b> I want sent. The reperusal of the Admiral, by the way, was a sore blow; eh, God, man, it is a low, black, dirty, blackguard, ragged piece: vomitable in many parts--simply vomitable. Pew is in places a reproach to both art and man. But of all that afterwards. What I mean is that I believe in playing dark with second and third-rate work. Macaire is a piece of job-work, hurriedly bockled; might have been worse, might have been better; happy-go-lucky; act it or-let-it-rot piece of business. Not a thing, I think, to send in presentations. Do not let us gober ourselves--and, above all, not gober dam pot-boilers--and p.b.'s with an obvious flaw and hole in them, such as is our unrealised Bertrand in this one. But of this also, on a meeting.|$|E
