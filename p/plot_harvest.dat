40|$|Hard Red Winter (HRW) and Soft Red Winter (HRW) wheat classes (Triticum aestivum L.) and oat (Avena sativa L.) are {{commonly}} {{established as a}} source of winter and spring forage for cattle grazing in many regions of Texas and the U. S. Southern Great Plains. Small grains used in these grazed systems offer the flexibility of management for season long forage production or production of both forage and grain (dual-purpose). Many commercially available and experimental cultivars are continually evaluated on their ability to produce grain, but little yield data is available on wheat and oats under dual-purpose management systems. In forage production systems, soil fertility management is also an integral component in meeting specific yield goals that producers depend upon to sustain adequate animal performance. Current nitrogen (N) recommendations in Texas are based on heavy, moderate, and light levels of grazing. To address these issues, two-year studies were initiated at three locations in Central Texas. The objectives of these studies were; (1) to evaluate thirty wheat and ten oat cultivars based on forage production and grain yield to identify those best suited to dual-purpose management; (2) to determine winter wheat forage yield potential at varying levels of N fertility; and (3) to evaluate five minimally invasive and non-destructive methods of quantifying forage yield. Results from dual-purpose cultivar evaluations included significant differences in forage yield, nutritive value, and grain yield between cultivars and species. Overall, oat produced less forage than either class of wheat, but Mg content was generally higher in oat. For grain production, SRW performed better under irrigation, but in dryland situations both wheat classes performed equally. We also found that pre-plant N fertilizer significantly reduced stand establishment in dry environments. The 67 kg ha- 1 pre-plant N and the 45 kg ha- 1 top-dress rates produced the highest forage yield. Nutritive value generally increased as N application rate increased, even when no yield increase was observed. Hand clipping and canopy height both correlated very well with full <b>plot</b> <b>harvest</b> and visual ratings and NDVI had moderate relationships with full <b>plot</b> <b>harvest.</b> The relationship between ground cover and dry matter yield was variable and only weakly correlated...|$|E
40|$|Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has {{potential}} for both bioenergy and forage. The objectives of this experiment were to: i) determine whether switchgrass could be harvested for greater nutritive value during the vegetative stage relative to early reproductive growth (boot stage); ii) compare biomass yields of switchgrass harvested once versus twice {{per year for}} bioenergy; and iii) examine effects of N fertilizer rates on harvest systems. The experiment was a randomized complete block design with a split-plot arrangement of harvest system treatments as main <b>plot</b> (<b>harvest</b> once per year after frost, harvest twice per year first at vegetative or boot stage and regrowth after frost) and nitrogen (N) fertilizer rate as subplots (0, 90, 180, and 270 kg N ha- 1). Biomass yield was greatest and nutrient concentrations were least in the one-cut system. For the two-cut system, nutritive values and yields were similar. Total annual biomass increased linearly with N fertilization. Across N rates, CP concentration for the two-cut systems was 50 % greater (71 g kg- 1) and ADF and NDF concentrations were 20 % lesser (465 and 856 g kg- 1, respectively) than switchgrass in the one-cut system. Switchgrass harvested at vegetative through boot stage and its regrowth could provide forage of acceptable nutritive value to beef cows. However, greater nutrient removal requires appropriate soil fertility evaluation and fertilizer management for sustainable yields...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{documents}} methodological {{lessons from}} experience in estimating yield and incremental production {{benefits from the}} Malawi Farm Input Subsidy Programme (FISP). Critical issues raised concern difficulties in obtaining reliable estimates of smallholder maize production, areas and yields with and without fertiliser. Comparison of methods and findings across {{a number of studies}} suggests that there is a significant upward bias (or overestimate) in area estimates obtained by relying on information from farmers on the areas of their crops. Use of GPS technology appears to provide an affordable but more reliable alternative method for measurement of plot areas, but further investigation is advisable regarding its accuracy and possible bias in measuring small plot areas. Estimates of yield from information on total plot harvests are affected by bias in area measurement and, for given estimates of production per plot, over-estimates of area lead to under-estimates of yield. However these yield estimates are also dependent upon the accuracy of farmer estimates of plot production, and these are potentially prone to (a) errors in farmer estimates of production and harvest, (b) unwillingness of farmers to reveal total harvest, and (c) errors in reporting harvests in standard units. While (b) is likely to lead to under-estimates of harvest and yield, (a) and (c) might lead to over- or under- estimates of harvest. It is not clear what overall bias this might lead to. The main alternative method of yield estimation (enumerators harvesting yield sub plots) is costly and widely considered to lead to over-estimates of yield. Estimates of crop yield response to fertiliser application are not affected by bias in plot area estimation if yield is estimated from reported whole <b>plot</b> <b>harvest.</b> However fertiliser responses are over- (under-) estimated if whole <b>plot</b> <b>harvest</b> is over-(under-) estimated by farmers. Fertiliser responses are also over-estimated if yield sub plots over-estimate yield, and this is exacerbated if plot areas are over-estimated, as this leads to an under-estimate of fertiliser application rate. Over-estimates of fertiliser yield responses are also likely if analysis does not allow for the effects of early planting, plant density, seed type, number of weedings and early weeding: these management practices raise yields but tend to be correlated with fertiliser use. Analysis of subsidy impacts needs to separate out the effects of these practices and also estimate how far management practices are changed by receipt of subsidised inputs. The following recommendations are highlighted regarding area and yield survey methods: •	IHS 2 estimates of crop areas and yields should be treated with caution as they are likely to have over-estimated areas and under-estimated yields •	Further work is needed to investigate the accuracy of GPS area measurement for small plots, but GPS methods are preferable to farmer estimates of plot areas •	Continued work is needed to develop accurate methods for estimating plot yields •	Investigation of fertiliser yield responses may need to rely on formal trials to address problems of multi-collinearity across management practices •	Due attention should be paid to both inter cropped and pure stands in analysis and reporting of yield and area estimates...|$|E

Following aspects were evaluated: number of full-grown, tuber yield, {{the average number of}} tubers in a bunch, the average weight of tubers in a bunch, the average weight of one tuber and starch content. The experiment started in 2013 on the farm of Ing. Tomáš Dušička in Plasy. In the experiment there were used cultivars of Red Anna and Monika because of good reputation. Certified seed was used in reproduction level C 2, farmer seed was gained in the same location. Tubers were planted on the 5 th May 2013, using two row seed planter (row spacing 75 cm and tuber distance 25 cm). Tubers were planted in the height of 16 cm.

40|$|Introduction In {{an effort}} to assist {{producers}} in Oklahoma and Texas judge variety performance, the Noble Foundation has held trials to determine forage and grain yields of commercially available varieties and advanced experimental lines of small grains. The objective of this report is to summarize yields from the 2007 - 2008 trials. Trial Procedures The small grains tests were conducted at the Noble Foundation Dupy Farm near Gene Autry and the Red River Demonstration and Research Farm (RRF) near Burneyville, Okla. Soils were a Dale silt loam at Dupy and a Minco fine sandy loam at RRF. Ten sources contributed entries to the trial (Table 1). The entries were seeded in a clean-tilled seedbed on Oct. 4, 2007, at Dupy and Oct. 2, 2007, at RRF. Each variety was sown at 2, 000, 000 pure live seed (PLS) per acre, which approximated 90 to 120 lb PLS/acre, depending on the crop and entry. Seeds were drilled in 7 -inch rows at a 1 -inch planting depth with a HEGE 500 drill. The entries were seeded in two adjacent 5 - by 15 -foot plots. The adjacent plots represented forage only use and dual purpose forage and grain use. Both <b>plots</b> were <b>harvested</b> {{at the same time}} for forage during the fall. Once first hollow stem stage of wheat was reached in the spring, the dual-purpose half was no longer harvested for forage to allow grain production. <b>Plots</b> <b>harvested</b> for forage only were harvested on Dec. 4, Feb. 12, March 14, April 1 and May 16 at Dupy and on Dec. 7, Feb. 18, March 18, April 11 and May 19 at RRF. <b>Plots</b> <b>harvested</b> for forage and grain were harvested for forage on Dec. 4 and Feb. 12 and for grain on June 17 at Dupy. At RRF, <b>plots</b> <b>harvested</b> for forage and grain were harvested for forage on Dec. 7 and Feb. 18 and for grain on June 23. Fertilization at Dupy consisted of preplant incorporation of 80 lb N/acre on Sept. 11 and a topdress application of 80 lb N/acre on Feb. 12. At RRF, plots were topdressed with N at 80 lbs/ac on Feb. 18, 2007. An application of Amber at 0. 56 ou/acre was applied on Oct. 5 at Dupy and RRF to control annual ryegrass. The trials were randomized complete block designs with three replications. Entries were blocked by crop and randomized within each replication. Data were analyzed by crop with the general linear models procedure in SAS (Statistical Analysis Software, Cary, N.

40|$|Breeding {{birds were}} {{surveyed}} in five watersheds in northern Minnesota for four years. In three watersheds (Knife, Pokegama, Cloquet) 12, 6 to I 0 acre plots were established. In two watersheds (Knife, Gooseberry) one large(> 40 acre) plot was established. Plots were established to assess breeding bird response to harvest type and J:iarvest method in riparian forests. Treatments in the Pokegama watershed included removal of basal area to 25 - 35 ft within 100 ft of {{either side of}} the stream with two different harvest methods (grapple skidding and cut-to-length systems). Uplands adjacent to riparian buffers were clearcut and three total (no <b>harvest)</b> <b>plots</b> were maintained in the watershed as well as three uncut riparian control <b>plots.</b> Before <b>harvest</b> data were collected in 1997, harvest was completed in the fall of 1997, and after harvest data collected in 1998, 1999 and 2000. Treatments in the Knife watershed ranged from clearcut in the riparian area to 25 - 35 ft residual basal area within 100 feet {{on one side of the}} stream. Uplands adjacent to riparian buffers were clearcut and three total (no <b>harvest)</b> <b>plots</b> were maintained in the watershed as well as three uncut riparian control <b>plots.</b> <b>Harvests</b> were not completed on all sites because of poor winter harvest conditions in 1997, 1998 and 1999. Breeding bird data have been collected in all years and will be collected in 200 I if all sites are harvested within this time frame. Treatments on sites in the Cloquet watershed were designed to examine bird response to harvest in the riparian area by leaving residual basal area (40 ft 2) in either a scattered or clumped pattern. Uplands adjacent to riparian buffers were clearcut and three total (no <b>harvest)</b> <b>plots</b> were maintained in the watershed as well as three uncut riparian control <b>plots.</b> <b>Harvests</b> were not completed on all sites because of poor winter harvest conditions in 1997, 1998 and 1999.

40|$|Cutting frequency, a {{critical}} factor influencing harvested forage yield, nutritive quality of forage and stand persistence, is normally linked with the time of flowering. This represents a significant changeable factor among quantity, quality, and length of the alfalfa crop. Furthermore, these factors are strongly correlated to the environmental situation and agronomic practices. A {{study was conducted to}} investigate the seed and forage yield potential of alfalfa under different cutting schedule, seeding rats and sowing methods. During this study one field and one pot experiment was carried out at the Agronomic Research Area, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, during the growing seasons of 2011 - 12 and 2012 - 13. In field experiment three cutting schedules (28, 35 and 42 day's interval) along with three seeding rates (10, 15 and 20 kg ha- 1) and four sowing methods (Broadcasting, 30, 45 and 60 cm apart rows) were evaluated. After the removal of first forage cutting 70 days after sowing (DAS), next alfalfa cutting was done at 28, 35 and 42 days interval for 2 nd and 3 rd cuts. After taking three forage cuts the alfalfa crop was left for seed production. Results of the field experiment showed that with Plant height, fresh and dry weight of alfalfa increased with longer cutting schedule of 42 days interval (C 3), lower seeding rates 10 kg ha- 1 and wider row spacing (60 cm). Moreover, number of stems m- 2, fresh and dry matter yields ha- 1 was higher with longer cutting schedule (42 days interval), higher seeding rates and narrow row spacing. Among quality parameters crude protein (CP), relative feed value (RFV) and total digestible nutrients (TDN) was higher with shorter cutting interval, higher seeding rate and narrow row spacing. However crude fibre (CF), acid detergent fibre (ADF) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) were decreased with shorter cutting interval, higher seeding rates and narrow row spacing. The 28 days cutting interval when last cutting date for seed production (19 February), lower seeding rates and wider row spacing produced significantly higher racemes m- 2, number of seeds per pod- 1 and higher seed yield ha- 1 compared to all other treatment combinations. Similarly higher pods per raceme were produced by last cutting date (19 February), lower seeding rate and wider row spacing.

40|$|An {{enclosure}} {{technique is}} used to monitor soil NO and N 2 O emissions during early summer regrowth of Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) on sandy loam in a humid, subtropical region of southern Texas. The evolution of both gases was substantially higher from <b>plots</b> <b>harvested</b> {{at the beginning of}} the experiment and fertilized five days later with 52 kg N/ha as (NH 4) 2 SO 4 than from <b>plots</b> not <b>harvested</b> or fertilized. Emission of NO, but not N 2 O, was stimulated by clipping and removing the grass, probably because eliminating the shading provided by the dense grass canopy changed these plots from cooler to warmer than unharvested plots, thereby stimulating the activity of soil microorganisms responsible for NO production. Neither gas flux was significantly affected by application of N until the next rainfall dissolved and moved the surface-applied fertilizer into the soil. Immediately thereafter, emissions of NO and N 2 O increased dramatically to peaks of 160 and 12 g N/ha/d, respectively, and then declined at rates that closely parallel the nitrification rate of added NH 4 (+), indicating that the gases resulted from the activity of nitrifying microorganisms, rather than denitrifiers. Nitric oxide emissions during the nine-week measurement period averaged 7. 2 times greater than N 2 O emissions and accounted for 3. 2 percent of the added N. The data indicate that humid, subtropical grasslands, which not only have large geographical extent but also have been subject to intense anthropogenic disturbance, contribute significantly to the global atmospheric NO(x) budget...|$|R
40|$|Bark {{extracts}} of the African cherry (Prunus africana) {{are used}} to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia. This study {{examined the effects of}} commercial bark harvest on population dynamics in the Kilum-Ijim Forest Preserve on Mount Oku, Cameroon and on traditional uses. P. africana is valued for its timber and as fuel although its greatest value is as a traditional medicine for human and animal ailments. Harvest has depleted the resource and has eroded traditional forest protection practices. I constructed matrix models {{to examine the effects of}} bark harvest on population structure and on population dynamics in harvested and unharvested populations. Harvesting simulations examined the effect on the population growth rate (λ) with differing levels of mortality of harvest-sized and large trees and differing harvest frequencies. Size class frequencies for the entire forest decreased in a reverse j-shaped curve, indicating adequate recruitment in the absence of <b>harvest.</b> Individual <b>plots</b> showed differences from the overall forest data, suggesting effects of natural and man-made perturbations, particularly due to bark <b>harvest.</b> One <b>plot</b> (<b>harvested</b> in the 1980 s) showed a temporal difference in λ and fluctuated around one, due to alternating high and low fruiting years; other unharvested plots showed smaller temporal differences. <b>Harvested</b> <b>plots</b> (<b>harvested</b> illegally in 1997) had values of λ less than one and showed small temporal differences. The control plot also showed λ less than one, due to poor recruitment in the closed canopy forest. The value of λ for the combined data was 0. 9931 suggesting a slightly declining population. The elasticity matrix for the combined data indicated the population growth rate was most sensitive to the survival of the large reproductive trees (42. 5 % of the elasticity). In perturbation analyses, reducing the survival of the large trees caused the largest reductions in λ. Simulations involving harvesting frequency indicated λ returns to pre-harvest conditions if trees are re-harvested after 10 – 15 years, but only if the large trees are left unharvested. Management scenarios suggest harvest can be sustainable if seedlings and small saplings are planted in the forest and actively managed, although large-scale plantations may be the only feasible option to meet market demand. ...|$|R
40|$|Five barley {{varieties}} and nine oat varieties {{were included in}} the 2006 small grain demonstration plots at Kanawha. Each variety was sown in three different plots to average out the effects of soil variability. The varieties were planted April 12 with the barley seeded at a rate of 2 bushels/acre and the oats seeded at a rate of 3 bushels/acre. All <b>plots</b> were <b>harvested</b> on July 24...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{productive}} {{variability in}} horticultural crops affects {{the planning and}} quality of the experiments, leading to wrong conclusions. The objectives of this study were to verify the spatial dependence of the fresh biomass of snap beans and to dimension the number of plants and harvests that are necessary to improve experimental accuracy in trials. The data of the fresh biomass of snap beans from uniformity trials carried out in a greenhouse and in the field with semivariograms were created with data transformed into indicators. Thus, they were combined on scenarios of <b>plot</b> size and <b>harvest</b> grouping, and they were adjusted to the spherical, exponential and Gaussian models. A response surface was also applied, with the variation coefficient as a dependent variable and the numbers of plants per <b>plot</b> and <b>harvests</b> as independent variables. The estimates of the semivariogram models parameters indicated a weak spatial dependence. The average of the fresh biomass of snap beans is distributed randomly in the trials, and it is not influenced by the number of plants per plot or by the number of grouped harvests. The best combinations between the number of plants per <b>plot</b> and <b>harvest,</b> for the smaller variation coefficients, are plots of 24 plants for plastic greenhouse and field, and 28 plants for plastic tunnel, in the autumn-winter, combined with the grouping of all harvests. In the spring-summer the number of plants per plot was 30 for plastic tunnel and field, also combined with the grouping of all harvests...|$|R
