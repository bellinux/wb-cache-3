25|$|By 1985 {{the number}} of {{institutions}} of higher learning had again increased - to slightly more than 1,000. The State Education Commission and the Ministry of Finance issued a joint declaration for nationwide unified enrollment of adult students - not the regular secondary-school graduates but the members of the work force who qualified for admission by taking a test. The State Education Commission established unified questions and time and evaluation criteria for the test and authorized provinces, autonomous regions, and special municipalities to administer the test, grade the papers in a uniform manner, and determine the minimum points required for admission. The various schools were to enroll students according to the results. Adult students needed to have the educational equivalent of senior-middle-school graduates, and those applying for release or <b>partial</b> <b>release</b> from work to study were to be under forty years of age. Staff members and workers were to apply to study job-related subjects with review by and approval of their respective work units. If employers paid for the college courses, the workers had to take entrance examinations. In 1985 colleges enrolled 33,000 employees from various enterprises and companies, approximately 6 percent of the total college enrollment.|$|E

60|$|I {{dropped a}} form of {{consolation}} {{which seemed to be}} encouraging me in the persuasion that my discontent was the chief evil in the world, and my benefit the soul of good in that evil. May there not be at least a <b>partial</b> <b>release</b> from the imprisoning verdict that a man's philosophy is the formula of his personality? In certain branches of science we can ascertain our personal equation, the measure of difference between our own judgments and an average standard: may there not be some corresponding correction of our personal partialities in moral theorising? If a squint or other ocular defect disturbs my vision, I can get instructed in the fact, be made aware that my condition is abnormal, and either through spectacles or diligent imagination I can learn the average appearance of things: is there no remedy or corrective for that inward squint which consists in a dissatisfied egoism or other want of mental balance? In my conscience I saw that the bias of personal discontent was just as misleading and odious as the bias of self-satisfaction. Whether we look through the rose-coloured glass or the indigo, we are equally far from the hues which the healthy human eye beholds in heaven above and earth below. I began to dread ways of consoling which were really a flattering of native illusions, a feeding-up into monstrosity of an inward growth already disproportionate; to get an especial scorn for that scorn of mankind which is a transmuted disappointment of preposterous claims; to watch with peculiar alarm lest what I called my philosophic estimate of the human lot in general, should be a mere prose lyric expressing my own pain and consequent bad temper. The standing-ground worth striving after seemed to be some Delectable Mountain, whence I could see things in proportions as little as possible determined by that self-partiality which certainly plays a necessary part in our bodily sustenance, but has a starving effect on the mind.|$|E

40|$|SummaryPost-Golgi vesicles {{target and}} deliver most biosynthetic cargoes {{to the cell}} surface. However, the {{molecules}} and mechanisms involved in fusion of these vesicles are not well understood. We have employed a system to simultaneously monitor release of luminal and membrane biosynthetic cargoes from individual post-Golgi vesicles. Exocytosis of these vesicles is not calcium triggered. Release of luminal cargo can be accompanied by complete, <b>partial,</b> or no <b>release</b> of membrane cargo. <b>Partial</b> and no <b>release</b> of membrane cargo of a fusing vesicle are fates associated with kiss-and-run exocytosis, and we find {{that these are the}} predominant mode of post-Golgi vesicle exocytosis. <b>Partial</b> cargo <b>release</b> by post-Golgi vesicles occurs because of premature closure of the fusion pore and is modulated by the activity of clathrin, actin, and dynamin. Our results demonstrate that these components of the endocytic machinery modulate {{the nature and extent of}} biosynthetic cargo delivery by post-Golgi vesicles at the cell membrane...|$|R

30|$|Considering the {{suggested}} magnitudes and source {{regions of the}} past earthquakes along the Japan Trench, the events recorded concurrently in the two cores studied above may correspond to earthquakes that {{are a part of}} this supercycle (Fig.Â  4 b). The earthquakes related to the supercycle are implied to have occurred over at least the last 4000 Â years, and the cycle may have shortened slightly in recent years (Fig.Â  4 b). If the earthquake supercycle is regulated by cumulative slip as previous studies have indicated, these shorter intervals are a potentially influenced by the decrease in number of earthquakes that were recorded only in one core. These earthquakes (other than giant earthquakes) might have also contributed to <b>partial</b> <b>releases</b> of cumulative slip in common with the off-Miyagi earthquakes.
