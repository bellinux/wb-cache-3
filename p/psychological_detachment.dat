50|$|The fifth {{stage of}} {{psychosexual}} {{development is the}} genital stage that spans puberty through adult life, and thus represents most of a person's life; its purpose is the <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment</b> and independence from the parents. The genital stage affords the person the ability to confront and resolve his or her remaining psychosexual childhood conflicts. As in the phallic stage, the genital stage is centered upon the genitalia, but the sexuality is consensual and adult, rather than solitary and infantile. The psychological difference between the phallic and genital stages is that the ego is established in the latter; the person's concern shifts from primary-drive gratification (instinct) to applying secondary process-thinking to gratify desire symbolically and intellectually by means of friendships, a love relationship, family and adult responsibilities.|$|E

30|$|In general terms, {{the data}} {{presented}} certain similarities between the forms of victimization: the greatest distress for either men or women was due to their lower tolerance of <b>psychological</b> abuse (<b>Detachment</b> or Humiliation). In the case of males, a lower tolerance of abuse with reference to Coercion and Physical Abuse was observed, whereas for females more often than not, it was Sexual Abuse. On the other hand, the differences found between the sexes regarding the levels of distress considered in the CUVINO factors, showed that women presented {{a higher level of}} distress (lower tolerance) than men regarding each and every form of abuse, especially Physical Abuse, Humiliation, Sexual Abuse and Detachment. Bearing this in mind, males displayed some levels of discomfort of a more moderate nature, with their highest levels related to Humiliation, Detachment and Physical Abuse. In contrast, the lowest levels of distress for women were found {{to be related to the}} Emotional Punishment and Coercion factors, whereas in men, these were related to Sexual Abuse, Gender Abuse and Emotional Punishment. We understand these results to hold a major implication for the design of the prevention strategies, in which the areas of priority clearly need special emphasis. Although the high levels of anxiety that lead to certain violent conduct could not be systematically equated with the low levels of tolerance, it is possible to use these results as an indicator of the levels of sensitising the youths towards such conditions. Diverse studies have analysed the effect of minimisation and/or normalisation of violent conduct in relationships with the risk of said relationship becoming abusive (Harned 2005; Hernando et al. 2012), with its association with the maintenance of this type of relationship (Dunham and Senn 2000; Rhatigan et al. 2011), and also with the disengagement from legal proceedings (Cala et al. 2016).|$|R

40|$|Employees {{have gained}} {{increased}} flexibility in organizing {{their work in}} time and space, that is boundaryless work. Managing the boundaries between work and personal life {{would seem to be}} crucial if one is to psychologically detach from work during leisure in order to unwind and get sufficient sleep. Drawing from a sample of Swedish professional workers (N =  3, 846), a theoretical model was proposed testing the inter-relationships between boundaryless work in time and space, weekly work hours, <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment,</b> sleeping problems and sleep duration using a structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis. Findings showed that working boundlessly in time, that is spread out during the working day and week, was directly associated with both long weekly work hours and lack of <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment.</b> In contrast, working boundlessly in space, that is at several different places, was inversely associated with weekly work hours and had no association with <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment.</b> <b>Psychological</b> <b>detachment,</b> in turn, was directly associated with sleeping problems and inversely associated with sleep duration. Sleeping problems were inversely associated with sleep duration. Employees with long weekly work hours had a low degree of sleeping problems. There was also no association between long weekly work hours and sleep duration. These findings contradict earlier research, however, we interpret these findings as that if one works a great deal but is able to mentally detach from work-related feelings and thoughts during free time, then sleep will not be hampered because perseverative cognitions associated with prolonged biological activation will have been interrupted. As such, <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment</b> can be regarded as the mechanism that mediates the relationships between working 'anytime' and long weekly work hours, and sleep. It was concluded working boundlessly in time increases the likelihood for long weekly work hours and lack of <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment.</b> Hence, employees working 'anytime - all the time' run the risk of 'always being on' resulting in disturbed sleep...|$|E

40|$|Theoretical thesis. Includes bibliographical references. This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationships}} between workplace incivility and recovery at the day-, person- and team-level. It was suggested that recovery could represent an underlying mechanism through which incivility affects individuals in the longer term, and that both contextual factors and team-level recovery experience norms might affect this relationship. The results of this thesis supported these assertions, with both variables related {{at a number of}} different levels. The first and second studies examined relationships at the day-level, demonstrating that when an individual experiences workplace incivility their after-work recovery process is negatively impacted, with the effects lasting into the next-day. The second study demonstrated that the likelihood of experiencing such uncivil behaviours changes with the day of the week, becoming less likely as an employee moves from Monday to Friday. The final study explored the person- and team-level of analysis, demonstrating that those who experienced more co-worker incivility were less likely, while those who experienced more supervisor incivility were more likely, to engage in after-work relaxation experiences. In contrast, neither form of incivility significantly affected <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment</b> experiences at the between-person level, indicating {{the relationships between}} incivility and recovery experiences differ significantly with the level of measurement. At the team-level, <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment</b> operated as a group-norm, with those that worked in a team with a positive <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment</b> norm (i. e. that encouraged <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment)</b> {{more likely to engage in}} both relaxation and <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment</b> experiences. Variables that may moderate these relationships were also tested. Strengths and limitations of this thesis are presented, together with implications for practice and future research.

40|$|Residential aged care {{facilities}} make {{an important contribution}} to meeting the health care needs of an increasingly ageing population in Australia. It is important to consider their employees’ well-being as this has been linked to residents’ satisfaction. A quantitative and qualitative study was implemented with the aim of examining the extent to which <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment</b> buffered against work stressors of employees in residential aged {{care facilities}}. Initially, a paper-based and online survey, which included demographic information and self-report questionnaires, was distributed to aged care facilities in regional Queensland. Following this, semi-structured interviews were conducted to further clarify work stressors, work strain, and personal resources of residential aged care employees. A model was put forward based on the conservation of resources (COR) theory which argues that employees seek to protect what they value (i. e. their resources) and the actual or perceived loss of resources produces a reaction to minimise their loss. The model proposes that work stressors are a threat to employees’ emotional or physical resources and employees consider leaving their workplace to minimise loss of resources. Work stressors were conceptualised as organisational constraints (situations or demands that interfere with work performance), interpersonal conflict, and quantitative workload (volume and pace of work) while strain measures included emotional exhaustion, physical symptoms, and turnover intentions. It proposed that <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment</b> would minimise the loss of resources with the assumption that employees {{would be less likely to}} leave their employment if they had a greater ability to detach. Standard multiple regression analyses showed organisational constraints significantly positively predicted emotional exhaustion and turnover intentions. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses tested for moderator effects of <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment</b> on work stressors and strain. A significant interaction was found between interpersonal conflict and emotional exhaustion suggesting that the relationship is weaker for employees with high <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment</b> than for employees with low <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment.</b> Further, a significant interaction was identified between interpersonal conflict and physical symptoms demonstrating the relationship is weaker for employees with higher <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment.</b> Finally, emotional exhaustion mediated the relationship between organisational constraints and turnover intentions. Consequently, the model was partially supported with implications being that employers could provide more supportive work environments to encourage retention of employees. This may mean employers spend time identifying issues perceived by employees. For example support might occur through legitimising on-the-job training or recognising the value of supervisors and training them in providing emotional support to employees to preserve emotional resources and encourage retention of employees. Skills to enhance <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment</b> might also be provided in short, regular intervals...|$|E
40|$|A recent {{number of}} studies have focused on the {{relations}} between psychosocial factors and sleep disturbances. Like other work-related stressors, workplace byllying is associated with several negative consequences. However, few studies have investigated the influence of workplace byllying on disturbed sleep.

Further, we tested whether self–family facilitation relates to <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment</b> from work, recovery, and finally whether recovery relates to job performance.

In this study, we therefore investigated the effectiveness of a low-dose mindfulness intervention for recovery from work. In addition, differential responding to the treatment in terms of treatment-by-baseline interactions was studied. A sample of 140 employees participated in a randomized field experiment with a self-training and a wait-list control group. Three central recovery processes (<b>psychological</b> <b>detachment,</b> sleep quality, and sleep duration) were assessed with event-sampling methodology involving daily measurements over 10 workdays. Growth curve analyses revealed intervention effects on sleep quality and sleep duration. No effects were found for <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment</b> after work and for the proposed treatment-by-baseline interactions. Our findings are discussed in the context of occupational health promotion in general and mindfulness-based interventions in specific...|$|E
40|$|Social {{interactions}} at {{work can}} strongly influence people’s well-being. Extending past research, we examined how social conflicts with customers at work (SCCs) {{are related to}} employees ’ well-being (i. e., state negative affect, NA) and nonwork experiences (i. e., <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment</b> from work and negative work reflection at home) on a daily level. Using experience-sampling methodology, we collected data from 98 civil service agents over 5 working days. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed that on the daily level, SCCs were related to employees ’ NA {{as well as with}} their nonwork experiences. Specifically, SCCs were negatively related to <b>psychological</b> <b>detachment</b> from work and positively related to negative work reflection after work. Furthermore, results provide support for the mediating role of NA in the SCC–nonwork experiences relationship. The findings of the present study broaden the scope of workplace conflict research by showing that conflicts are not only associated with employees ’ impaired well-being but even encroach on their nonwork experiences...|$|E
