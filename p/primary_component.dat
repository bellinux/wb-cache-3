5|$|Fish are the <b>primary</b> <b>component</b> of {{the river}} otter's diet {{throughout}} the year. Every study done on the food habits {{of the river}} otter has identified varying fish species as being the <b>primary</b> <b>component</b> of its diet. For instance, an Alberta, Canada study involved the collection and analysis of 1,191 samples of river otter scats collected during each season. Fish remnants were found present in 91.9% of the scat samples. Moreover, a western Oregon study revealed fish remains were present in 80% of the 103 digestive tracts examined. Crustaceans (crayfish), where regionally available, are the second-most important prey for otters. Crustaceans may even be consumed more than fish. For example, a study conducted in a central California marshland indicated crayfish formed nearly 100% of the river otter's diet at certain times of the year. However, river otters, as foragers, will immediately take advantage of other prey when readily obtainable. Other prey consumed by river otters includes fruits, reptiles, amphibians, birds (most especially moulting ducks which render the birds flightless and thus makes them easier to capture), aquatic insects, small mammals, and mollusks.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. In {{line with}} its {{commitment}} to safe nuclear power generation, the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station (KNPS) replaced the outdated vibration monitoring system with a modern on-line vibration monitoring system. This will allow plant personnel to monitor components on a continuous basis which will provide faster response time in the scenario of excessive vibrations of the <b>primary</b> <b>components.</b> This study focuses on {{the analysis of the}} vibration of the <b>primary</b> <b>components</b> of the KNPS by analysing the frequency spectra of the vibration signals of the <b>primary</b> <b>components</b> and comparing these to reference signatures obtained during similar operating conditions. The condition of the vibration sensors will also be evaluated. In order to obtain {{a deeper understanding of the}} vibration behaviour and hence vibration signatures of the KNPS <b>primary</b> reactor <b>components,</b> a simplified mathematical model of the <b>primary</b> <b>components</b> is developed, based on the system of elasto-dynamic equations. The equations are solved numerically and used to simulate the KNPS vibration monitoring system. The mechanical system is modelled. Time series are generated and Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) are calculated to simulate the new KNPS monitoring system. In the simulation mechanical degradation of the <b>primary</b> <b>components</b> as well as sensor degradation is simulated. The purpose of this study is to indicate whether mechanical degradation has occurred in the <b>primary</b> <b>components</b> of the plant and to validate the vibration signals. At the same time the study aims to lay a foundation for future monitoring and interpretation of vibration signatures by simulating the vibration and the monitoring signals. It was found that the <b>primary</b> <b>components</b> had not been affected by mechanical degradation as no deviations in resonances were detected in the frequency signatures. A small number of vibration sensors were found to have deteriorated; hence replacement / maintenance was proposed. The mechanical model and the simulation of the monitoring signals proved to be useful to understand and interpret the vibration of the KNPS <b>primary</b> <b>components.</b> Master...|$|R

5|$|Based on spectroscopic observations, the <b>primary</b> <b>component</b> of the {{material}} on Pallas's surface is a silicate containing little iron and water. Minerals of this type include olivine and pyroxene, which are found in CM chondrules. The surface composition of Pallas {{is very similar to}} the Renazzo carbonaceous chondrite (CR) meteorites, which are even lower in hydrous minerals than the CM type. The Renazzo meteorite was discovered in Italy in 1824 {{and is one of the}} most primitive meteorites known. Pallas's visible and near-infrared spectrum is almost flat, being slightly brighter in towards the blue. There is only one clear absorption band in the 3-micron part, which suggests an anhydrous component mixed with hydrated CM-like silicates.|$|E

The ships were {{intended}} {{to operate in the}} Baltic Sea as a <b>primary</b> <b>component</b> of an integrated coastal defense system proposed by General Albrecht von Stosch, the Chief of the Admiralty. Stosch designated the ships Ausfallkorvetten (sortie corvettes), denoting their intended use. In the event of war with a superior naval power and the imposition of a naval blockade, the Sachsen-class ships would sortie from fortified bases to attack the blockaders. They also had the task of breaking up landing attempts. The German railway network linked the bases so ground forces could be transferred to the sites of enemy landings.|$|E

40|$|Binomials are polynomials with at most two terms. A {{binomial}} {{ideal is}} an ideal generated by binomials. <b>Primary</b> <b>components</b> and associated primes of a binomial ideal are still binomial over algebraically closed fields. <b>Primary</b> <b>components</b> of general binomial ideals over algebraically closed fields with characteristic zero can be described combinatorially by translating the operations on binomial ideals to operations on exponent vectors. In this dissertation, we obtain more explicit descriptions for <b>primary</b> <b>components</b> of special binomial ideals. A feature of this work is that our results are independent of the characteristic of the field. First of all, we analyze the primary decomposition of a special class of binomial ideals, lattice ideals, in which every variable is a nonzerodivisor modulo the ideal. Then we provide a description for primary decomposition of lattice ideals in fields with positive characteristic. In addition, we study the codimension two lattice basis ideals and we compute their <b>primary</b> <b>components</b> explicitly. An ideal I ? k[x_(1),?. x_(n) ] is cellular if every variable is either a nonzerodivisor modulo I or is nilpotent modulo I. We characterize the minimal <b>primary</b> <b>components</b> of cellular binomial ideals explicitly. Another significant result is a computation of the Hull of a cellular binomial ideal, that is the intersection of all of its minimal <b>primary</b> <b>components.</b> Lastly, we focus on commutative monoids and their congruences. We study properties of monoids that have counterparts {{in the study of}} binomial ideals. We provide a characterization of primary ideals in positive characteristic, in terms of the congruences they induce...|$|R

5|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>component</b> of the Fleet was its battleships, {{typically}} {{organized in}} eight-ship squadrons, though it also contained various other formations, including the I Scouting Group. At its creation in 1907, the High Seas Fleet {{consisted of two}} squadrons of battleships, and by 1914, a third squadron had been added. The dreadnought revolution in 1906 greatly affected {{the composition of the}} fleet; the twenty-four pre-dreadnoughts in the fleet were rendered obsolete and required replacement. Enough dreadnoughts for two full squadrons were completed by the outbreak of war in mid 1914; the eight most modern pre-dreadnoughts were used to constitute a third squadron. Two additional squadrons of older vessels were mobilized at the onset of hostilities, though {{by the end of the}} conflict, these formations were disbanded.|$|E

5|$|French {{astronomer}} Charles Messier discovered M87 in 1781, cataloguing it as a nebulous feature while {{searching for}} objects that would confuse comet hunters. The second brightest galaxy within the northern Virgo Cluster, M87 is located about 16.4 million parsecs (53.5 million light-years) from Earth. Unlike a disk-shaped spiral galaxy, M87 has no distinctive dust lanes. Instead, {{it has an}} almost featureless, ellipsoidal shape typical of most giant elliptical galaxies, diminishing in luminosity with distance from the centre. Forming around one sixth of M87's mass, the stars in this galaxy have a nearly spherically symmetric distribution, their density decreasing with increasing distance from the core. At the core is an active supermassive black hole, which forms the <b>primary</b> <b>component</b> of an active galactic nucleus. This object is a strong source of multiwavelength radiation, particularly radio waves. M87's galactic envelope extends out to a radius of about 150 kiloparsecs (490,000 light-years), {{where it has been}} truncated—possibly by an encounter with another galaxy. Between the stars is a diffuse interstellar medium of gas that has been chemically enriched by elements emitted from evolved stars.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} name Capella is Latin for (small) female goat; {{the alternative}} name Capra was {{more commonly used}} in classical times. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table {{of the first two}} batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Capella for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. The catalogue of star names lists Capella as applying to the star with the designations α Aurigae, HR 1708, HD 34029, and HIP 24608, which suggests only the <b>primary</b> <b>component</b> of the Capella system should receive that name. The IAU's own documentation makes it explicit that the proper name should strictly only be applied to the visually brightest component. In this case it is somewhat uncertain which of the components is the brightest and the IAU list does not specify.|$|E
5|$|The {{two stars}} in Serpens Caput that {{form part of}} the Snake's body below the heart are Epsilon and Mu Serpentis, both third-magnitude A-type main-sequence stars.

This star also has a peculiarity; it is a binary with the <b>primary</b> <b>component</b> being a Lambda Boötis star, meaning that it has solar-like amounts of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, while containing very low amounts of iron peak elements. 25 Serpentis, positioned a few degrees northeast of Mu Serpentis, is a spectroscopic binary consisting of a hot B-type giant and an A-type main-sequence star. The primary is a slowly pulsating B star, which causes the system to vary by 0.03 magnitudes.|$|E

5|$|Aboriginal {{cultural}} areas {{depend upon}} their ancestors' primary lifeway, or occupation, {{at the time}} of European contact. These culture areas correspond closely with physical and ecological regions of Canada. The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast were centred around ocean and river fishing; in the interior of British Columbia, hunter-gatherer and river fishing. In both of these areas the salmon was of chief importance. For the people of the plains, bison hunting was the primary activity. In the subarctic forest, other species such as the moose were more important. For peoples near the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, shifting agriculture was practised, including the raising of maize, beans, and squash. While for the Inuit, hunting was the primary source of food with seals the <b>primary</b> <b>component</b> of their diet. The caribou, fish, other marine mammals {{and to a lesser extent}} plants, berries and seaweed are part of the Inuit diet.

5|$|The {{star system}} is the {{prototype}} {{of a group of}} eclipsing binary stars named Algol variables, though it has a third member to make up what is actually a triple star system. The brightest component is a blue-white main-sequence star of spectral type B8V, which is 3.5 times as massive and 180 times as luminous as the Sun. The secondary component is an orange subgiant star of type K0IV that has begun cooling and expanding to 3.5 times the radius of the Sun, and has 4.5 times the luminosity and 80% of its mass. These two are separated by only 0.05 astronomical units (AU)—five percent of the distance between the Earth and Sun; the main dip in brightness arises when the larger fainter companion passes in front of the hotter brighter primary. The tertiary component is a main sequence star of type A7, which is located on average 2.69 AU from the other two stars. AG Persei is another Algol variable in Perseus, whose <b>primary</b> <b>component</b> is a B-type main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 6.69. Phi Persei is a double star, although the two components do not eclipse each other. The primary star is a Be star of spectral type B0.5, possibly a giant star, and the secondary companion is likely a stellar remnant. The secondary has a similar spectral type to O-type subdwarfs.|$|E
