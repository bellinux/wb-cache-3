40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of topological insulator (TI) offers {{new opportunities for}} the development of thermoelectrics, because many TIs (like Bi$_ 2 $Te$_ 3 $) are excellent thermoelectric (TE) materials. In this review, we will first describe the general TE properties of TIs and show that the coexistence of the bulk and boundary states in TIs introduces unusual TE properties, including strong size effects and anomalous Seebeck effect. Importantly, the TE figure of merit $zT$ of TIs is no longer an intrinsic property, but depends strongly on the geometric size. The geometric parameters of two-dimensional TIs can be tuned to enhance $zT$ to be significantly greater than 1. Then a few proof-of-principle experiments on three-dimensional TIs will be discussed, which observed unconventional TE phenomena that are closely related to the topological nature of the materials. However, current experiments indicate that the metallic surface states, if their advantage of high mobility is not fully utilized, would be detrimental to TE performance.

However, the inability to cultivate most soil bacteria hampered fundamental attempts to determine the diversity of the prokaryotic world and limited its industrial exploitation. In the last 20 years, new methods have been developed to overcome these limitations based on the direct extraction of DNA from bacteria in their natural environment. In addition to fundamental research, the cloning of the extracted DNA for the development of metagenomic DNA clone libraries offers <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>discover</b> novel bio-molecules through the expression of genes from uncultivated bacteria in surrogate bacterial hosts.

In this paper, we report that the size of DNA fragments extracted from soil varied in a range between less than 100 kb and more than 400 kb depending on the soil. The relatively limited size of DNA fragments extracted from some soil was not only due to mechanical, chemical or enzymatic shearing of the DNA during the extraction process but partly to the microbial growth status.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} on {{programming}} approaches {{to exploit the}} computational capabilities of chemical systems, consisting of two parts. In the first part, constructive design, research activities on theoretical development of chemical programming are reported. As results of the investigations, general programming principles, named organization-oriented programming, are derived. The idea is to design reaction networks such that the desired computational outputs correspond to the organizational structures within the networks. The second part, autonomous design, discusses on programming strategies without human interactions, namely evolution and exploration. Motivations for this programming approach include <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>discover</b> novelty without rationalization. Regarding first the evolutionary strategies, we rather focused on how to track the evolutionary processes. Our approach is to analyze these dynamical processes on {{a higher level of}} abstraction, and usefulness of distinguishing organizational evolution in space of organizations from actual evolution in state space is emphasized. As second strategy of autonomous chemical programming, we suggest an explorative approach, in which an automated system is utilized to explore the behavior of the chemical reaction system as a preliminary step. A specific aspect of the system's behavior becomes ready for a programmer to be chosen for a particular computational purpose. In this thesis, developments of autonomous exploration techniques are reported. Finally, we discuss combining those two approaches, constructive design and autonomous design, titled as a hybrid approach. From our perspective, hybrid approaches are ideal, and cooperation of constructive design and autonomous design is fruitful...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: -aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays {{important}} roles in the central nervous system, acting as a neurotransmitter on both ionotropic ligand-gated Cl [...] channels, and metabotropic G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These two types of receptors called GABAA (and C) and GABAB are the targets of major therapeutic drugs such as the anxiolytic benzodiazepines, and antispastic drug ba-clofen (lioresal®), respectively. Although the multiplicity of GABAA receptors offer a number of <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>discover</b> new and more selective drugs, the molecular characterization of the GABAB receptor revealed a unique, though complex, heterodimeric GPCR. High throughput screening strategies carried out in pharmaceutical industries, helped identifying new compounds positively modulating the ac-tivity of the GABAB receptor. These molecules, almost devoid of apparent activity when applied alone, greatly enhance both the potency and efficacy of GABAB agonists. As such, in contrast to baclofen that constantly activates the receptor everywhere in the brain, these positive allosteric modulators induce a large increase in GABAB-mediated responses only WHERE and WHEN physiologically needed. Such compounds are then well adapted to help GABA to activate its GABAB receptors, like benzodiazepines favor GABAA receptor acti-vation. In this review, the way of action of these molecules will be presented in light of our actual knowledge of the activation mecha-nism of the GABAB receptor. We will then show that, as expected, these molecules have more pronounced in vivo responses and less side effects than pure agonists, offering new potential therapeutic applications for this new class of GABAB ligands.

40|$|Technology-oriented {{fields are}} still largely male-dominated, and an {{effective}} approach {{for increasing the}} number of women in natural science and technology careers has not yet been achieved in EU countries. A related concern, particularly in Finland, is that even though gender equality and non-discrimination have long been critical concerns in education to date there has been very little of research in Finland about girls’ motivations towards technical craft or technology education, nor about their relation to women’s career aspirations in technology-oriented fields. The present study is my contribution to the concern of getting more women into technology by investigating how to increase girls’ access to and interest in technology education in basic education, and to add to our understanding of what affects women’s interests in entering technology-related careers in Finland. This dissertation is compiled from four sub-studies: a document analysis (Study 1), two questionnaire studies (Studies 2 and 3) and an interview study (Study 4). In total, the empirical data comprises of the answers of 281 pupils to a questionnaire, the answers of 24 women to a questionnaire and 7 interviews. The data analysis methods varied in each of the sub-studies by use of mixed methods, or a multimethodological approach. First, the findings suggest that in order to promote girls in technology education, it would be important that they would have equal <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>discover</b> technological topics and gain self-esteem in the field already in primary school. Based on the findings, {{it is also clear that}} there are differences in girls’ and boys’ motivations concerning the contents of technology education. Thus, curriculum writers and teachers should pay more attention to girls in order to enable them to see that technology is relevant for them. Concerning women in technology-oriented fields, it is evident that the most influential career anchors were their high-level of competence and familiarity of the field. Also, based on the findings it is evident that there have been, and still might be, gender related issues in technology education and in working life. To conclude, technical craft and technology education should be developed with an eye towards gender-sensitive learning experiences and pupils should be offered the support and encouragement needed to experience new learning habits. Technology education has the potential to foster pupils’ technological literacy in ways that respond equitably to human needs now and into the future...|$|R
