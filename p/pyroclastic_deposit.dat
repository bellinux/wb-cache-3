25|$|The Potrillo {{volcanic}} {{field has}} two important xenolith localities that are Kilbourne Hole and Potrillo maar where mantle peridotites, feldspathic granulites and kaersutite occur. Alkali feldspar, olivine and basalt were erupted {{during the middle}} and late quaternary. Rock samples collected {{in the northern part}} of the <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>deposit</b> of the Potrillo maar, and lava associated with a cinder cone yielded potassium–argon ages, approximately 1.29 and 1.18million years. The magmatism is entirely basaltic forming scattered scoria cones. Several short lava flows were originated from each cone. There is a diverse rock types beneath the Potrillo volcanics, the range is from Proterozoic granites through a Phanerozoic sedimentary succession to basalt-andesite volcanics of the southern fringes of the Sierra de las Uvas volcanic field. The Potrillo area is generally classified as part of the southern Rio Grande rift and shows the Cenozoic tectonic evolution of that structure.|$|E

2500|$|Jupiter's intense {{radiation}} belts {{near the}} orbit of Io forced Galileo to come no closer than {{the orbit of}} Europa {{until the end of}} the first extended mission in 1999. Despite the lack of close-up imaging and mechanical problems that greatly restricted the amount of data returned, several significant discoveries at Io were made during Galileos two-year, primary mission. During the first several orbits, Galileo mapped Io in search of surface changes that occurred since the Voyager encounters 17 years earlier. This included the appearance of a new lava flow, Zamama, and the shifting of the Prometheus plume by [...] to the west, tracking the end of a new lava flow at Prometheus. Starting with Galileos first orbit, the spacecraft's camera, the Solid-State Imager (SSI), began taking one or two images per orbit of Io while the moon was in Jupiter's shadow. This allowed Galileo to monitor high-temperature volcanic activity on Io by observing thermal emission sources across its surface. The same eclipse images also allowed Galileo scientists to observe aurorae created by the interaction between Io's atmosphere and volcanic plumes with the Io flux tube and the plasma torus. During Galileos ninth orbit, the spacecraft observed a major eruption at Pillan Patera, detecting high-temperature thermal emission and a new volcanic plume. The temperatures observed at Pillan and other volcanoes confirmed that volcanic eruptions on Io consist of silicate lavas with magnesium-rich mafic and ultramafic compositions, with volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide serving a similar role to water and carbon dioxide on Earth. During the following orbit, Galileo found that Pillan was surrounded by a new, dark <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>deposit</b> composed of silicate minerals such as orthopyroxene. The Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) observed Io on a number occasions during the primary mission, mapping its volcanic thermal emission and the distribution of sulfur dioxide frost, the absorption bands of which dominate Io's near-infrared spectrum.|$|E

40|$|We present new {{observations}} of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>deposits</b> {{on the surface}} of Mercury from data acquired during the orbital phase of the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) mission. The global analysis of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>deposits</b> brings the total number of such identified features from 40 to 51. Some 90 % of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>deposits</b> are found within impact craters. The locations of most <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>deposits</b> appear to be unrelated to regional smooth plains deposits, except some deposits cluster around the margins of smooth plains, similar to the relation between many lunar <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>deposits</b> and lunar maria. A survey of the degradation state of the impact craters that host <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>deposits</b> suggests that <b>pyroclastic</b> activity occurred on Mercury over a prolonged interval. Measurements of surface reflectance by MESSENGER indicate that the <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>deposits</b> are spectrally distinct from their surrounding terrain, with higher reflectance values, redder (i. e., steeper) spectral slopes, and a downturn at wavelengths shorter than ~ 400 [*]nm (i. e., in the near-ultraviolet region of the spectrum). Three possible causes for these distinctive characteristics include differences in transition metal content, physical properties (e. g., grain size), or degree of space weathering from average surface material on Mercury. The strength of the near-ultraviolet downturn varies among spectra of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>deposits</b> and is correlated with reflectance at visible wavelengths. We suggest that this interdeposit variability in reflectance spectra is the result of either variable amounts of mixing of the <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>deposits</b> with underlying material or inherent differences in chemical and physical properties among <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>deposits...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{terrestrial}} 3 D Laser Scanning {{technique has}} been applied to analyse the surface roughness of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>deposits</b> on volcanic surfaces at Mt. Etna. This technique allowed the construction of high accuracy digital elevation models of small surfaces, about 1 m across. Sampled surfaces differ for percentage of coverage and for grain size of the <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>deposits.</b> The change in grain size distribution for the <b>pyroclastic</b> unconsolidated <b>deposits</b> affects the surface roughness. The roughness of the site where the finest <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>deposits</b> occur is mainly governed by large scale wavelength morphology (Hurst exponent H = 0. 77 for lengths larger than 16 mm).

The lower unit begins with one metre of lapilli and above it thick ignimbrite layers that become increasingly non-welded farther up with vapour phase components appearing. There was no prior Plinian fallout. Orbs and two differently coloured pumices are located in the upper section of the lower unit, with some xenoliths. The upper cooling unit contains two types of pumice, one strongly welded and the other weakly so, and is much richer in lithic fragments. The upper unit was erupted in several discrete flows from the central complex. Some pumice fall layers are embedded in the upper unit.|$|E

The altitude of top surface of the Kakuto <b>Pyroclastic</b> Flow <b>Deposit</b> becomes higher toward the west in this area. Altitude is about 60 meters above sea level around Kokubu alluvial plain and is about 220 meters in the eastern margin of Jusan-tsukabaru plateau though thickness of the <b>pyroclastic</b> flow <b>deposit</b> is almost same. This feature described above suggests that a peculiar mode of occurrence of the Kakuto <b>Pyroclastic</b> Flow <b>Deposit</b> coincides with the topography of the erosion surface of the basement rocks.

40|$|Images {{obtained}} by the MESSENGER spacecraft have revealed evidence for pyroclastic volcanism on Mercury. Because {{of the importance of}} this inference for understanding the interior volatile inventory of Mercury, we focus on one of the best examples determined to date: a shield-volcano-like feature just inside the southwestern rim of the Caloris impact basin characterized by a near-central, irregularly shaped depression surrounded by a bright deposit interpreted to have a pyroclastic origin. This candidate <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>deposit</b> has a mean radius of ~ 24 km, greater in size than the third largest lunar <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>deposit</b> when scaled to lunar gravity conditions. From the extent of the candidate <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>deposit,</b> we characterize the eruption parameters of the event that emplaced it, including vent speed and candidate volatile content. The minimum vent speed is ~ 300 m/s, and the volatile content required to emplace the pyroclasts to this distance is hundreds to several thousands of parts per million (ppm) of the volatiles typically associated with pyroclastic eruptions on other bodies (e. g., CO, CO 2, H 2 O, SO 2, H 2 S). For comparison, measurements of the exsolution of volatiles (H 2 O, CO 2, S) from basaltic eruptive episodes at Kilauea volcano, Hawaii, indicate values of ~ 1300 – 6500 ppm for the terrestrial mantle source. Evidence for the presence of significant amounts of volatiles in partial melts derived from the interior of Mercury is an unexpected result and provides a new constraint on models for the planet's formation and early evolution...|$|E
