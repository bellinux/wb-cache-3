5|$|Late in the 20th century, lithium {{became an}} {{important}} component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high electrode potential. Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratio.</b> A typical lithium-ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid or 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon cells. Lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and have a high energy density, {{should not be confused with}} lithium batteries, which are disposable (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode. Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium-ion polymer battery, lithium iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.|$|E
5|$|The T19 Howitzer Gun Motor Carriage {{was similar}} to the M3 Half-track, as it shared the same chassis, engine, {{suspension}}, armor, and fuel tank. It was 20ft 2 in long, 6ft 5 in wide, 7ft 8 in high, with a weight of 9.54short tons. The suspension consisted of semi-elliptical longitudinal leaf springs for the wheels and vertical volute springs for the tracks. It was powered by a White 160AX, 147hp, 386 in3, six-cylinder gasoline engine with a compression ratio of 6.3:1. It was capable of a maximum road speed of 45mph. The <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> was 14.7hp/ton.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{had first}} begun to {{consider}} the potential applications of steam power for transportation while still an apprentice in the 1780s, and had developed rudimentary designs for 'steam carriages' in the 1790s. In 1801, Evans definitively began work on making his long-held dream of a steam carriage into reality. Early steam engineers, most notably Watt contemporary William Murdoch, had developed plans for a steam-propelled carriage incorporating a heavy flywheel, in which pressure was converted directly to rotary power, however it became apparent in experimentation that a low-pressure, rotary steam engine would never be powerful enough to propel a carriage of any weight forward. Evans's attention thus turned to a reciprocating engine, not only for his steam carriage ideas, but also for industrial application. Importantly, Evans became an early proponent of 'strong steam' or high-pressure engines, an idea long resisted by Watt and earlier steam pioneers because the necessary iron making and metal working technology was lacking. Evans recognized that a high-pressure steam engine would be essential {{to the development of}} a steam carriage because they could be built far smaller while providing similar or greater power outputs to low-pressure equivalents. Some experiments with high-pressure steam engines had been made in Europe, most notably an unsuccessful steam tractor developed by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot. However the prevailing fear of early steam engineering was that no boiler could safely contain high-pressure steam. Evans ignored potential drawbacks, and developed radically different designs which called for engines operating at high-pressure and the elimination of the condenser—a central component of conventional designs. His designs also incorporated a grasshopper beam, a double-acting cylinder, and four steam valves. Each valve was independently operated by one of four cams. The resulting design was a high-pressure steam engine that had a higher <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> that prevailing designs, making locomotives and steamboats practical. It was also mechanically simpler than condensing engines, making it less costly to build and maintain, and did not require large volumes of condensing water. These features would make it similarly suited for a variety of industrial applications.|$|E
5000|$|The {{causes of}} {{locomotive}} wheelslip vary, but the predominant factor {{lies in the}} <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratios.</b> Ideally, locomotive designs will have roughly equal <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratios</b> that enable smooth acceleration from a 'cold start', or stopping position. However, if {{the power of a}} locomotive vastly exceeds its weight, then an imbalance ensues which causes the violent spinning of the wheels through loss of traction.|$|R
30|$|Recent {{trends in}} {{robotics}} require actuators with high <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratios.</b> For example, robots designed to support human movement must be light {{for safety and}} to enable standing and walking, and machines used for construction must have sufficient force to manipulate large objects. Hydraulic actuators are commonly used in these applications because of their <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratios</b> and their remote driving units (i.e., power sources, electric motors, servo units, and oil tanks).|$|R
50|$|Victors had {{impressive}} <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratios</b> {{that made}} them ideal for hill climbs. The 11:1 compression ratio required a compression release lever for kick starting.|$|R
25|$|Turbocharging can {{dramatically}} improve an engine's {{specific power}} and <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratio,</b> performance characteristics that are normally poor in non-turbocharged diesel engines.|$|E
25|$|Armoured {{engineering}} vehicles {{based on}} the Arjun are also assumed to be in development, as the Arjun induction will require units of a similar <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> or powerful enough to tow it, or recover it on the battlefield.|$|E
25|$|PT-76B {{fitted with}} a new V-6M diesel engine {{developing}} 300hp (224kW) which increased the maximum road speed from 44km/h to 45km/h and the maximum swimming speed from 10,2km/h to 11,2km/h. This increased the <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> from 17.1hp/tonne (12.3kW/tonne) to 19.5hp/tonne (14.5kW/tonne).|$|E
50|$|All {{animals and}} devices capable of {{sustained}} flight need relatively high <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratios</b> {{to be able}} to generate enough lift and/or thrust to achieve take off.|$|R
5000|$|Improvement of {{the overall}} {{efficiency}} and <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratios</b> of power electronics to within 25 percent of targets, while reducing cost by 86 percent to $10/kW since 1995 ...|$|R
50|$|Electric motors {{are more}} {{efficient}} than ICEs, with high <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratios</b> providing torque over a wide speed range. ICEs are most efficient when turning at a constant speed.|$|R
25|$|The race is {{conducted}} under the Racing Rules of Sailing determined {{and published by}} the International Sailing Federation. For the 2005 race, the event organisers removed certain restrictions on the boats. As successful sailing {{is based on a}} good <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratio,</b> larger sails are expected to help break race records.|$|E
25|$|Seeing {{the success}} of the Navy's NY-1 {{modification}} of a PT-1 airframe, the USAAC {{came to the conclusion that}} a radial engine was indeed ideal for a trainer. It was reliable and offered a good <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratio.</b> Therefore one PT-1 airframe was completed as XPT-2 with a 220hp (164kW) Wright J-5 Whirlwind radial engine.|$|E
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of the Cosworth DFV in , F1 constructors found the exceptional <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> of the new engine gave them much more power than the grip levels of their cars could deal with, particularly in wet conditions. As a result several solutions were tried, with three leading Cosworth customers and even Cosworth themselves each trying their hand at building 4WD F1 cars.|$|E
50|$|Combat {{aircraft}} use engines {{with low}} bypass ratios to compromise between fuel {{economy and the}} requirements of combat: high <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratios,</b> supersonic performance, {{and the ability to}} use afterburners.|$|R
50|$|Increased engine {{performance}} is a consideration, but also other features associated with luxury vehicles. Longitudinal engines are common. Bodies vary from hot hatches, sedans (saloons), coupés, convertibles and roadsters. Mid-range dual-sport and cruiser motorcycles {{tend to have}} similar <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratios.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Many home EV {{conversions}} use {{the large}} format versions as the car's traction pack. With the efficient <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratios,</b> high safety features and the chemistry's refusal {{to go into}} thermal runaway, there are few barriers for use by amateur home [...] "makers".|$|R
25|$|Initial {{experience}} with the Advanced Passenger Trains was good. They had a high <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> to enable rapid acceleration; the prototype set record speeds on the Great Western Main Line and the Midland Main Line, and the production versions vastly reduced journey times on the WCML. The APT was, however, beset with technical problems; financial constraints and negative media coverage eventually caused the project to be cancelled.|$|E
25|$|For the suspension, the B31 {{featured}} double wishbones, {{coil springs}} over dampers with an anti-roll {{bar at the}} front, and single top links, twin lower links, twin trailing arms, coil springs over dampers with an anti-roll bar at the rear. The brakes were ventilated discs all round, and the car had rack-and-pinion steering. As the car weighed , it had a <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> of exactly 0.5hp/kg.|$|E
25|$|Several {{variations}} {{exist in}} two general groups. The first preserves the two-stroke-engine sound by tuning the original two-cylinder engine for higher performance or using a two-stroke propulsion unit designed for another car, {{such as the}} 1000cc Wartburg). Since the Trabant is light——a small increase in engine power can rapidly increase its <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratio.</b> Some enthusiasts have used the durable, easily tuned Trabant for rally {{and other types of}} racing.|$|E
50|$|Electric motors {{can provide}} high <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratios,</b> and {{batteries}} {{can be designed}} to supply the large currents to support these motors. Electric motors have very flat torque curves down to zero speed. For simplicity and reliability, many electric cars use fixed-ratio gearboxes and have no clutch.|$|R
50|$|NASA's German Touring Series (GTS for short) is a road racing series {{involving}} six {{classes of}} German cars organized strictly based on <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratios.</b> This formula provides broad flexibility in both vehicle choice {{and in the}} modifications allowed. The result is {{a broad range of}} modifications and extraordinarily close racing.|$|R
25|$|At {{a combat}} weight of just 56 tons, the Leclerc {{is one of}} the lightest main battle tanks in the world; this gives it one of the best <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratios</b> among the Western tanks (27hp per ton) and makes it one of the fastest MBTs of its {{generation}} (0 to 32km/h in 5 seconds).|$|R
25|$|According to late 1907 {{claims made}} by Clément Ader, on 8 October 1890, the machine {{achieved}} a short flight of around 50m (164ft) at the Chateau d'Armainvilliers in Brie. It reached {{a height of}} around 20cm (8in). The poor <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> of the steam engine and bad weather were felt to limit the flying height achieved. Ader later claimed to have flown the Éole again in September 1891, this time to a distance of 100m (328ft), but this claim is less substantiated.|$|E
25|$|Wankel {{engines are}} {{considerably}} lighter and simpler, containing far fewer moving parts than piston engines of equivalent power output. Valves or complex valve trains are eliminated by using simple ports {{cut into the}} walls of the rotor housing. Since the rotor rides directly on a large bearing on the output shaft, there are no connecting rods and no crankshaft. The elimination of reciprocating mass, and the elimination of the most highly stressed and failure prone parts of piston engines, gives the Wankel engine high reliability, a smoother flow of power, and a high <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E
25|$|The aircraft's {{extremely}} low wing loading of just 23.9lb/ft² gave it outstanding turning performance, and its high <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0.186hp/lb gave superb climbing {{performance for the}} time. The lack of an engine supercharger was a serious handicap at high altitudes. Compared to the later Allison-engined P-40, the P-36 shared the P-40's traits of excellent high-speed handling, roll rate that improved at high speed, and relatively light controls at high speed. However, it was underpowered, affecting its acceleration and top speed, {{and it did not}} accelerate in a dive as well as the P-40.|$|E
50|$|Electric dragsters {{have come}} of age with new {{developments}} in battery and motor technology. Electric motors powered by lithium cells can deliver <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratios</b> similar to high performance gasoline engines. Drag races last around ten seconds so battery range is not an issue. A number of electric dragbikes and dragsters (cars) are competing with Top Fuel classes. Electric drag racing records are listed at NEDRA.|$|R
50|$|Axial-flow waterjets produce {{high volumes}} at lower velocity, making them {{well suited to}} larger low to medium speed craft, the {{exception}} being personal water craft, where the high water volumes create tremendous thrust and acceleration as well as high top speeds. But these craft also have high <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratios</b> compared to most marine craft. Axial-flow waterjets {{are by far the}} most common type of pump.|$|R
50|$|NASCAR's {{concerns}} with speeds because of <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratios</b> result in restrictor plates at other tracks. The Goody's Dash Series (known {{now as the}} ISCARS series with its new ownership) used restrictor plates at Bristol during at least {{the last years of}} the series' existence when the cars were using six-cylinder engines (compared to the traditional four cylinder engines), in addition to their Daytona races.|$|R
25|$|A {{gas turbine}} offers some {{advantages}} over a piston engine. There are few moving parts, decreasing {{the need for}} lubrication and potentially reducing maintenance costs, and the <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratio</b> is much higher. A turbine of a given power output is also physically smaller than an equally powerful piston engine, allowing a locomotive to be very powerful without being inordinately large. However, a turbine's power output and efficiency both drop dramatically with rotational speed, unlike a piston engine, which has a comparatively flat power curve. This makes GTEL systems useful primarily for long-distance high-speed runs.|$|E
25|$|By 1908 Geoffrey de Havilland had {{designed}} and built two motorcycle engines and his first aircraft, the de Havilland Biplane No. 1. He had studied the engine used by the Wright brothers and believed that he could design a similar unit with an improved <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratio.</b> Whilst working as a designer for the Motor Omnibus Construction Company in London he produced drawings for his new engine {{over a period of}} three to four months and commissioned the Iris Cars Ltd, where his brother Ivon de Havilland had been the Chief Designer, to build the first prototype at a cost of £250.|$|E
25|$|Climb {{performance}} is {{strongly related to}} the <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratio,</b> and is maximized by wrapping the smallest and lightest possible airframe around the most powerful available engine. Another goal was that the G-58 (Grumman's design designation for the aircraft) {{should be able to}} operate from escort carriers, which were then limited to the obsolescent F4F Wildcat as the Grumman F6F Hellcat was too large and heavy. A small, lightweight aircraft would make this possible. After intensively analyzing carrier warfare in the Pacific Theater of Operations {{for a year and a}} half, Grumman began development of the G-58 Bearcat in late 1943.|$|E
40|$|Substrates survive high {{deposition}} temperatures. High-temperature-resistant polymers candidate {{materials for}} use as substrates of lightweight, flexible, radiation-resistant solar photovoltaic cells. According to proposal, thin films of copper indium diselenide or cadmium telluride deposited on substrates to serve as active semiconductor layers of cells, parts of photovoltaic power arrays having exceptionally high <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratios.</b> Flexibility of cells exploited to make arrays rolled up for storage...|$|R
50|$|Several {{factors have}} emerged {{to change this}} equation. First, {{a number of new}} {{manufacturers}} of general aviation aircraft developing new designs have emerged. Second, in Europe in particular, avgas has become very expensive. Third, in several (particularly remote) locations, avgas is harder to obtain than diesel fuel. Finally, automotive diesel technologies have improved greatly in recent years, offering higher <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratios</b> more suitable for aircraft application.|$|R
50|$|Drivers {{are free}} to meet the {{specified}} <b>power-to-weight</b> <b>ratios</b> in any manner they choose. Some target lower horsepower but with low weight while others feel high horsepower (and the related extra weight) is the hot ticket. Many, of course, split the difference and sit somewhere in the middle. The concept behind GTS is that, as a car owner or driver, you can pursue your own chosen path to an optimal configuration.|$|R
