Trust for America’s Health has charted federal funding for the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, which in turn provides {{a major portion of}} financing for state and local <b>public</b> <b>health</b> departments, and has compiled information about state-generated revenue commitments to <b>public</b> <b>health</b> activities nationwide. The federal-level analysis shows that funding has been marked by diminished support for “core ” <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>functions.</b> The state-level analysis shows tremendous variation in use of state revenues to support <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>functions.</b> The combination of these factors results in very different <b>public</b> <b>health</b> capacities across the country, potentially leaving some states more vulnerable, while simultaneously posing a general threat to the nation since <b>public</b> <b>health</b> problems do not honor state borders. On the basis of this analysis, the authors suggest changes in the financing arrangements for <b>public</b> <b>health,</b> designed to assure a more stable funding stream for core <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>functions</b> and a more consistent approach to financing <b>public</b> <b>health</b> activities across the country.

40|$|Despite {{having been}} {{described}} by the then (2003) Chief Pharmaceutical Officer for England as ·probably the biggest untapped resource for health improvement", {{the development of the}} <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>function</b> of community pharmacists has been limited. However, devolution of healthcare budgets has led 10 differential rates of development of the <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>function</b> in each administration of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). This is measured and reflected upon in this thesis. Two large-scale surveys were conducted, one of key strategic personnel (Directors of Public Health and Chief Pharmacists) in Primary Care Organisations (PCOs) and one of practicing community pharmacists. This research highlights the fact that community pharmacists have developed an individualistic, service-based approach to their engagement with public health that is contrary to the more collective approach adopted by the wider public health movement. The study measures the scope and level of health-improving services through community pharmacy across the UK and shows that the nature of the pharmacy contractor (independent, multiple etc.) may impact on the range and nature of services provided. Survey data also suggest that attitudes towards pharmacy involvement in the public health agenda vary markedly between Directors of Public Health, PCO Chief Pharmacists, and community pharmacists. Furthermore, within the community pharmacist population, attitudes are affected by a wide range of factors including the nature of employment (owner, employee, self-employed) and the type of employing pharmacy (independent, multiple etc.).

Ten years ago, following similar concerns, the Acheson Report highlighted several issues with striking parallels to the present day. These included uncertainty over the future and role of public health medicine following repeated Health Service reorganisations. The Report recommended the expansion of the specialty in both communicable disease control and public health medicine in general, and a more clearly defined role for public health medicine. Successive health authority mergers and the specialty 2 ̆ 7 s inclusion as part of management costs have meant that the Report 2 ̆ 7 s findings have yet to be fully implemented.

To respond to this call for further examination, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2 ̆ 019 s <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> Law Program conducted a fundamental activities legal assessment on state <b>public</b> <b>health</b> laws. ObjectiveThe goal of the legal assessment was to examine state laws referencing frameworks representing <b>public</b> <b>health</b> department fundamental activities (ie, core and essential services) in an effort to identify, catalog, and describe enabling authorities of state governmental <b>public</b> <b>health</b> systems. DesignIn 2013, <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> Law Program staff compiled a list of state statutes and regulations referencing different commonly-recognized <b>public</b> <b>health</b> frameworks of fundamental activities. The legal assessment included state fundamental activities laws available on WestlawNext as of July 2013. The results related to the 10 essential <b>public</b> <b>health</b> services and the 3 core <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>functions</b> were confirmed and updated in June 2016. ResultsEighteen states reference commonly-recognized frameworks of fundamental activities in their laws.

The data indicate that the reported strengths of the system lie in having the capacity to carry out most of the <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>functions.</b> Its reported weaknesses lie in three broad areas. First, it has overlooked some fundamental <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>functions</b> such as <b>public</b> <b>health</b> regulations and their enforcement.

In 2003, an electronic disease surveillance system (Alerta) {{was established in the}} Peruvian Navy with support from the U. S. Naval Medical Research Center Detachment (NMRCD). Many challenges arose during the implementation process, and a variety of solutions were applied. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify and discuss these issues. Methods This is a retrospective description of the Alerta implementation. After a thoughtful evaluation according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, the main challenges to implementation were identified and solutions were devised in the context of a resource-limited setting, Peru. Results After four years of operation, we have identified a number of challenges in implementing and operating this electronic disease surveillance system. These can be divided into the following categories: (1) issues with personnel and stakeholders; (2) issues with resources in a developing setting; (3) issues with processes involved in the collection of data and operation of the system; and (4) issues with organization at the central hub. Some of the challenges are unique to resource-limited settings, but many are applicable for any surveillance system. For each of these challenges, we developed feasible solutions that are discussed. Conclusion There are many challenges to overcome when implementing an electronic disease surveillance system, not only related to technology issues. A comprehensive approach is required for success, including: technical support, personnel management, effective training, and cultural sensitivity in order to assure the effective deployment of an electronic disease surveillance system. </p...|$|E

Flutracking is a weekly online survey of influenza-like illness (ILI) completed by community members that has been trialled in the 2006, 2007, and 2008 winter influenza seasons. The online survey allows participants to record their past and current influenza immunisation status and they receive a weekly email prompt to answer questions on the previous week's experience of cough, fever and time absent from normal activities. The weekly survey takes participants less than 15 seconds to complete. Symptom rates of Flutracking participants were compared by influenza vaccination status to estimate the incidence and severity of influenza and the field effectiveness of influenza vaccine. Participation rates increased from 394 in 2006 to 982 in 2007 and 4, 827 in 2008. In 2008, 56 % of participants were from New South Wales and 26 % were from Tasmania. Greater than 70 % of respondents replied within 24 hours of the survey being sent in 2007 and 2008.

40|$|Focal Point - There {{are reduced}} {{opportunities}} for locum pharmacists to access {{training and education}} that meets their needs and enables them to play a full role under the new pharmacy contract - Eighty-six per cent of locums consider themselves to be more health professional than business person, compared to just 48 % of pharmacy owners - Forty per cent of locums believe {{that a lack of}} access to training is a major barrier to the development of their <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>function</b> - While locum pharmacists are arguably more likely to embrace 'professionalising', patient-care-based roles, they are also the group least {{likely to be able to}} access the necessary training to fulfill such roles Introduction It has been suggested that locum pharmacists do not want the business-based responsibilities (e. g. staff management, meeting targets, etc) that come with pharmacy management. 1 Research also suggests that locums derive great satisfaction from the health-professional aspects of the pharmacists’ role (e. g. patient contact, the provision of advice, etc). 1 However, upon the introduction of the new pharmacy contract (April 2005), concerns were expressed that it was becoming increasingly difficult for locum pharmacists to access training and education that would meet their needs and enable them to play a full role under the new framework. 2, 3 Method After piloting, in August 2006 a self-completion postal questionnaire was sent to a random sample of practising community pharmacists, stratified for country and sex, within Great Britain (n = 1998), with a follow-up to non-responders 4 weeks later. Data were analysed using SPSS (v 12. 0). A final response rate of 51 % (n = 1023 / 1998) was achieved. Respondents were asked ‘indicate how you view yourself as a pharmacist’ – in terms of their relative focus on the health-professional and business aspects of their role. Respondents were also asked ‘do you consider a lack of training opportunities to be a barrier to the development of the public health role of community pharmacists?’. Results Locums were significantly more likely than owners or employees to consider each factor a major barrier. Discussion Four in 10 locums consider a lack of training opportunities to constitute a major barrier to the development of their <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>function.</b> Pharmacy may not be able to provide the services required of it by the policy agenda if pharmacists are unable to be involved in extended role activities through a lack of training opportunities. Therefore, the paradox that needs to be addressed is that while locum pharmacists are arguably more likely to embrace ‘professionalising’, patient-care-based roles, they are also the group least likely to be able to access training to fulfil such roles. The training needs of this large subset of the pharmacist population need to be assessed and met if the whole community pharmacy workforce is going to maximise its contribution to public health under the new contractual framework.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Our aim, {{as part of}} the {{collaborative}} study SPHERE (Strengthening Public Health Research in Europe), was to describe public health publications in the French language according to health needs and public health functions. METHOD: All articles published in six French public health journals, and one French/English language Canadian journal, over the period 1995 - 2004, were retrieved from three electronic databases. Original research articles were indexed by hand according to one main domain of health need, based on Global Burden of Disease categories, and into one of four public health functions. RESULTS: After removing duplicates, 3984 original research articles were identified. Only 51 % could be allocated to a health needs code. Of these, 71 % were about non-communicable diseases, 25 % communicable, maternal and perinatal conditions and 5 % injuries. This compared only moderately with the global burden of disease for France (84, 5 and 11 %, respectively). The other articles addressed health determinants, such as behavioural or environmental exposures, or a methodological issue. Ninety-two percent of the articles could be assigned a <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>function</b> code. Health monitoring and health services research accounted for 80 % of references from French journals. Only 9 % of articles from French journals were related to prevention, which was lower than that in the Canadian journal (17 %). Only 1 % of articles dealt with legislation. CONCLUSION: The distribution of articles in French public health journals broadly follows the distribution of health needs. History and data availability may explain the extra research focus on communicable diseases and maternal and child health research. Injuries, and prevention, are topics which appear to be under-represented in French language journals...|$|E
