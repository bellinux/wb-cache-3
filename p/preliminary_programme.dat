40|$|Over {{the past}} decade the {{evidence}} for the effectiveness of integrated treatment for people with co-occurring mental health and substance use problems has continued to expand. Yet {{there is still a}} paucity of evidence for which specific types of treatment interventions are effective for this client population. There is some emerging evidence for the effectiveness of group-based psychosocial interventions. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the effectiveness of an integrated psychosocial education and skill building group programme designed for people with co-occurring mental health and substance use problems. Assessment of pre-, mid- and post-group changes for participants of the programme using quantitative and qualitative outcome measures for some aspects of mental health and substance use was carried out. Participation in the programme resulted in significant improvements in depression, anxiety, stress and self-esteem. Motivation for making changes to substance use was enhanced and while the quantitative measure of psychological dependence on illicit drugs did not change, the qualitative measure of drug taking behaviour revealed considerable reductions.

40|$|Background: Arts-based {{activities}} are being increasingly suggested {{as a valuable}} activity for people living with dementia in terms of countering the negative aspects of their condition. The potential for such programmes to improve {{a broad range of}} psychosocial outcomes is suggested in some studies. However, there is largely an absence of rigorous methodology to demonstrate the benefits, and research results are mixed. Practice variability in terms of the content, contexts and implementation of such interventions raises challenges in terms of identifying an optimal arts programme model that could be adopted by other service providers. Understanding how interventions may have the best chance at broad implementation success and uptake is limited. Methods/Design: A realist review will be undertaken. This aims to understand how visual arts interventions influence outcomes in people living with dementia. The review will explore how the context, that is the circumstances which enable or constrain, affect outcomes through the activation of mechanisms. An early scoping search and a stakeholder survey formulated the <b>preliminary</b> <b>programme</b> theory. A systematic literature search across a broad range of disciplines (arts, humanities, social sciences, health) will be undertaken to identify journal articles and grey literature. Data will be extracted in relation to the programme theory, contextual factors, mechanisms and outcomes and their configurations, background information about the study design and participant characteristics, detail about the quantity (‘dose’) of an intervention, theoretical perspectives proposed by the authors of the paper and further theorising by the reviewer. Thematic connections/patterns will be sought across the extracted data, identifying patterns amongst contextual factors, the mechanisms they trigger and the associated outcomes. Discussion: Along with stakeholder engagement and validation, this review will help inform the development of an optimal, replicable arts intervention for people with dementia as part of our broader research programme, titled ‘Dementia and Imagination’ (funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council). Forthcoming work under this programme of research will test this theoretically informed intervention in three different geographical areas of the UK.

40|$|The {{last few}} years have {{confirmed}} what was mostly feared: Portuguese construction industry suffers from a chronic disease - the lack of competitiveness. Symptoms have long been recognised in several construction projects: frequent delays, cost overruns, deficient safety, absent quality. The authors have been carrying out several studies whose aiming at are clarify reasons {{for the lack of}} competitiveness of national construction industry on the four items mentioned above. This paper occurs mainly about the aims of PhD` survey about construction delays. It has the following mains components: (1) to research and analysis bibliography and establish a common set of causes and background reasons for the problem; (2) to inquire to Portuguese construction stakeholders on the causes and background reasons for project delays following from their experience in recent projects; (3) to establish possible paths to solve the problem. The survey results appear to confirm the original list of causes for delays of the study. The mains reasons are related with designer problems, poor productivity, procurement system, overly optimistic planning, and frequent change orders during construction and so on. Thereafter, the paper will seek what could possibly be done and from which parties, in order to correct the above problems and improve construction competitiveness. The most highly ranked on a scale of relevance by stakeholders were implementation a national database with the quantity works list for different construction projects, a more appropriate and efficient organizational systems within design teams and a need for greater care {{on the part of the}} owners when they prepare their schedules and <b>preliminary</b> <b>programmes.</b> Science and Technology Foundation, in Portuguese - Project SAPIENS Nº 4762 "Reasons for the lack of accomplishment of schedule, costs and safety objectives in construction".

40|$|A {{selection}} system for yeast cells expressing mutated invertase (EC 3. 2. 1. 26, SUC 2) with altered fructotransferase activity was developed {{based on the}} survival of a fructose-intolerant strain {{in the presence of}} suitable acceptor substrates and sucrose. Cells of such a strain expressing a wild-type hydrolase activity will not grow due to the release of free fructose from sucrose. Cells expressing an inactive invertase mutant will not grow since they cannot cleave the sucrose, the sole carbon source. Only cells expressing sucrose fructosyl-transferase activity will thrive, growing on the released glucose, the fructosyl moiety not being released. A strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was engineered to be intolerant of the presence of fructose in its growth media. This was achieved by inducing a condition in yeast similar to liver cells of humans suffering from hereditary fructose intolerance (MIM 22960). This disorder results from a deficiency of aldolase B (EC 4. 1. 2. 13), and phosphorylation of fructose by ketohexokinase (EC 2. 7. 1. 3) results in an accumulation of fructose 1 -phosphate, with a consequent depletion of cytoplasmic phosphate and ATP. Thus, cells in which ketohexokinase phosphorylates fructose, but which lack aldolase B, are intolerant of fructose. Yeast possess neither of these enzymes, and so expression of ketohexokinase in yeast would result in fructose-intolerance. A strain of yeast, for ketohexokinase expression, was initially bred to be unable to metabolize sucrose or fructose, yet remain capable of utilizing glucose, as well as lacking non-specific phosphatases, to prevent remobilization of sequestered fructose 1 -phosphate. Rat liver ketohexokinase was purified to heterogeneity, and the partial amino acid sequence subsequently generated exploited to amplify a region of the ketohexokinase cDNA by PCR. This was used to probe a cDNA library, yielding clones encoding the entire ketohexokinase coding region. This was cloned into pMA 91, and subsequent expression in yeast resulted in a strain intolerant of fructose in its growth medium, although still capable of growing on glucose. In order to produce a stable fructose-intolerant selection strain, a vector (pIAD l) was constructed that allowed multiple integration of an expression cassette containing ketohexokinase cDNA into the rDNA locus of yeast chromosome XII. Expression of wild type invertase from the episomal plasmid p IAD 3 in this strain resulted in sucrose-intolerance. A <b>preliminary</b> <b>programme</b> of mutagenesis of the SUC 2 gene yielded eight libraries of about one hundred clones each. None of these contained any mutants showing solely sucrose fructosyl-transferase activity, although this system would clearly provide an ideal selection for such mutants from a much larger library. </p...|$|E

40|$|The use of light-truss {{pultruded}} structures with {{bolted connections}} is nowadays a technique for the enhancement or a partial replacement of existing floors or roofs, because the light {{weight of the}} profiles enables them to be easily moved {{in the field and}} the limited increase in mass is favourable with respect to the building seismic behaviour. In common design practice, a simplified load distribution among the bolts in multi-row joints is used for the dimensioning, but no distinctions on the geometrical and mechanical characteristics of the jointed elements is considered. In this paper the results of a numerical investigation on the behaviour of a double lap joint composed of a central rigid steel plate placed between two side glass pultruded profiles and subjected to tensile axial forces are presented and discussed.

40|$|The oldest rocks {{exposed in}} the area are {{quartzites}} and schists of the Dove Group which underwent considerable deformation during the Precambrian. Upper (?) Cambrian acid lavas, volcanics, greywackes, cherts, siltstones and quartzites comprise the Bull Creek Volcanics and the Lorinna Volcanics. These rocks were formed in an easterly extension of the Dundas Trough, north of the Tyennan Block. The Dove Granodiorite intruded these rocks along the southern margin of the Trough in Late Jukesian (?) times. The petrology of the Cambrian rocks is discussed in some detail and it is concluded that the acid lavas were derived from the same magma as the Dove Granodiorite. Ordovician rocks in this area consist of the Roland Conglomerate at the base, which is conformably overlain by the Moina Sandstone and the Gordon Limestone in turn. During the Tabberabberan Orogeny, these rocks were folded and faulted into northwesterly trending structures. The Dolcoath Granite intruded late in the Tabberabberan Orogeny causing some metamorphism of the country rocks. It is suggested the granite intruded as a northerly dipping, roughly tabular body. There may be a small cupola in the Stormont area. The majority of the mineral deposits in this area are genetically related to the Dolcoath Granite.

40|$|Summary and conclusion: One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} facing the Swiss health care system remains continued fragmentation {{as a consequence of}} the federal structure and the division of responsibilities. This constitutes a major barrier for the implementation of a nationwide public health strategy and a more rational organization of health care. Much of the health reform agenda during the past decade was driven by cost-containment efforts. Despite the absence of a national regulatory framework targeting prevention and care of chronic diseases, national strategies and programmes have been developed within a growing recognition of the need to address chronic disease in the health care system. In addition, several small-scale pilot and <b>preliminary</b> structured care <b>programmes</b> have been implemented in selected localities. The latter are however still too few and limited in scope to cover the needs of the majority of patients with chronic diseases residing in Switzerland. Given the continued high satisfaction with the system among health care users, of around 80 %, pressure to actually initiate larger scale changes might not yet be sufficiently strong...|$|R
