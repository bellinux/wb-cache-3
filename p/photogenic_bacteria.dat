40|$|About 125, 000 t {{of water}} supply {{treatment}} plant residuals (WSTP-residuals) are annually produced in Germany, causing relatively high disposal expenses. Due to poor knowledge, the low cost alternatives, e. g. as application in agriculture or forestry, are still scarcely used. The {{aim of the}} presented {{study was to investigate}} the effects of WSTP-residuals when applicated in agriculture or forestry, while testing ferric and water softening sludges. In laboratory and field experiments miscellaneous soils, eluates and plants were checked by different methods (physical-pedological methods, ion analysis using ICP-OES, AAS and IC, study of enzyme activities, determination of biomass and plate counts as well as biological tests using <b>photogenic</b> <b>bacteria,</b> algae, nematode and cress). As a result it was shown, that application of ferric residuals on meadows or pasture-land can not be recommended, while a use on forest soils could be possible under defined conditions. If there is no exceeding of limitng values and if melioration effects are demonstrated, application on farm land is possible too. Softening sludges and pellets were shown to be useful on forest soils as well. Using water softening sludge, soil fertilization is easily demonstrated, however it is quiet difficult to prove beneficial effects when ferric sludge is applicated. Because of legal reasons it is not sufficient to show, that WSTP-residuals are quite harmless, positive effects have to be demonstrated. (orig.)

40|$|Background: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were {{considered}} as contaminats previously, but, {{during the past}} decade considered {{as one of the most}} common <b>photogenic</b> <b>bacteria</b> in hospital. Resistance to beta-lactams especially methicillin in staphylococcus species is being worrying in hospitals. Rapid identification of mechanisms of resistance and confirmation of their resistance to methicillin is a basic principle for antibiotic treatment. The aim of this study was to determine antibiotic resistance, frequency of mecA gene, and determination of SCCmec types in CoNS isolates from teaching hospitals in Iran. Methods: The descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out one hundred clinical samples isolated from patients with an average age of 7 - 69 years at teaching hospitals in Hamadan City, Iran, from September 2014 to February 2015. After confirmation of isolates by microbiological standard biochemical tests, antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by disk agar diffusion (DAD) method. After extraction of isolated genomicm, mecA gene was detected. Then, the types of SCCmec were performed by PCR. Results: In this study, 387 clinical samples were collected which among 100 CoNS isolated, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most prevalent species with frequency 55 (55 %), followed by S. haemolyticus 40 (40 %) and S. saprophyticus 5 (5 %). The highest antibiotic susceptibility was to rifampin 96 (96 %) and the lowest resistance was detected for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) 47 (47 %). None of the strains were resistant to vancomycin. Resistance to methicillin was detected in 50 % of CoNS isolates. Typing of SCCmec was performed by The polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Frequency types of SCCmec was type III with frequency 13 (13 %), type V 11 (11 %), type II 6 (6 %), type IV 4 (4 %), type I 3 (3 %) respectively. Thirteen isolated was not typable in this study. Conclusion: The result of this study showed that a large percentage of coagulase-negative staphylococci are resistance to methicillin, and the prevalence of SCCmec type was type III, which encodes the largest number of resistance genes. This information could be use in epidemiological study for preventing of infectious control in hospital and health centers...|$|E
40|$|Vaccine {{protection}} against <b>photogenic</b> gram-positive <b>bacteria</b> including {{different species of}} streptococci is an important problem of contemporary molecular biology. Streptococcal infections are most common bacterial infections surpassing by the economic losses all the infections excluding influenza. The gates of streptococcal infection, oral cavity or vagina, are covered with immune and non-immune mucosal cells that are {{the first line of}} defenses. Subcutaneous immunization not always stimulate the local immunity on mucosal surfaces. On the other hand, mucosal vaccination can provide an appropriate local immune response together with systemic protection. However, mucosal immunization often requires usage of special and effective adjuvants especially in case of vaccines based on recombinant proteins. For {{protection against}} Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, two chimeric recombinant proteins (PSPF and PSP) have been tested as vaccines. Recombinant proteins PSPF and PSP carry immunogenic epitopes from the respiratory pathogen including PspA, Spr 1875 and PsaA. PSPF structure also carries a fraction of flagellin-FliC molecule in comparison with PSP, which does not have this fragment. This portion of PSPF was included as internal adjuvant intended for the stimulation of Toll-like receptor 5. In this work, the adjuvant capacity of two probiotic strains, Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL 1505 and L. rhamnosus L 32 was evaluated. It was demonstrated that both lactic acid bacteria strains were able to provide adjuvant effects by enhancing the mucosal and systemic immune responses after their co-administration with the recombinant chimeric protein PSPF. The adjuvant effect of both Lactobacillus strains was significantly decreased after their thermal inactivation. However, the cell walls of bacteria showed a marked adjuvant activity. An improved protection against several S. pneumoniae serotypes after mucosal immunization of infant mice with PSPF vaccine with probiotic strains or their cell walls was also demonstrated here. The recombinant chimeric protein PSPF administered with immunomodulatory probiotic strains or their bacterial components would be a promising vaccine for immunization of humans against S. pneumoniae, particularly in children. </p...|$|R
