5|$|Instead, more {{abundant}} remains from Asia have <b>provided</b> <b>more</b> data. Initial remains were not promising; a partial fragmentary ischium from Heilongjiang, China, that Riabinin named S. kryschtofovici. Much better remains were soon recovered, though, but from Mongolia's early Maastrichtian-age Nemegt Formation. The 1946–1949 Russian-Mongolian paleontological expeditions recovered the large skeleton that became S. angustirostris {{as described by}} Anatoly Rozhdestvensky.

5|$|Zeus B {{had been}} test fired at both White Sands and the Zeus base on Kwajalein.

5|$|Another {{solution}} to the high-speed problem is the delta wing. The delta wing had {{many of the same}} advantages of the swept wing in terms of transonic and supersonic performance, but offered much more internal room and overall surface area. This <b>provided</b> <b>more</b> room for fuel, an important consideration given the inefficient early jet engines of the era, and the large wing area provided ample lift at high altitudes. The delta wing also enabled slower landings than swept wings in certain conditions. The disadvantages of the design were increased drag at lower speeds and altitudes, and especially higher drag while maneuvering. For the interceptor role these were minor concerns, as the aircraft would be spending most of its time flying in straight lines at high altitudes and speeds, mitigating these disadvantages.|$|E

5|$|However, {{these results}} {{also noted that}} the system might be able to work against longer-ranged missiles. Although these {{traveled}} at very high speeds, their higher altitude trajectories made detection simpler, and the longer flight times <b>provided</b> <b>more</b> time to prepare. Both projects were allowed to continue as research efforts, and were transferred to the US Air Force when that force separated from the Army in 1947. The Air Force faced significant budget constraints and cancelled Thumper in 1949 in order to use its funds to continue their GAPA surface-to-air missile (SAM) efforts. The next year Wizard's funding was also rolled into GAPA to develop a new long-range SAM design, which would emerge a decade later as the CIM-10 Bomarc. ABM research at the Air Force practically, although not officially, ended.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Chadwick was {{appointed}} Dean of Christ Church, uniquely a dual {{role as a}} cathedral dean and head of a college. This period was not entirely happy; a scholarly ability to see all sides of a question, along with an ingrained desire not to upset his colleagues, sometimes made it {{hard for him to}} make a quick or firm decision. However, during his time as Dean the college benefited from a continued programme of renovation with internal changes that <b>provided</b> <b>more</b> student accommodation. The position gave Chadwick the chance to influence the musical direction of the cathedral. In The Independent newspaper, obituary writer Andrew Louth notes that at the retirement of Sydney Watson as organist, when he and Chadwick played piano duets together Chadwick's technique was the equal of Watson's. The new organist, Simon Preston, had ambitious plans for improving musical standards, and Chadwick was pleased to be able to support these, not least by raising funds for a new organ.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Virtually every town or city erected some form of memorial to commemorate their dead. During the war, only London <b>provided</b> <b>more</b> recruits to the British Army than Manchester. The Manchester Regiment and the Lancashire Fusiliers, which largely recruited from the city and towns to the north, were swollen by pals battalions drawn from local employers, social groups, and neighbourhoods. By the end of the war, over 13,000 men of the Manchester Regiment, including more than 4,000 from the pals battalions and 13,600 Lancashire Fusiliers, had been killed. An estimated 22,000 Mancunians died and 55,000 were wounded.|$|E

Ecology had emerged as a combination of biogeography with the biogeochemical cycle concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed quantitative methods such as the quadrat and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists and botanists did what they could to mitigate the unpredictability of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments such as gardens; new institutions like the Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution and the Marine Biological Laboratory <b>provided</b> <b>more</b> controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.|$|E

5|$|Superman the Ride has {{undergone}} numerous safety upgrades. After the 2001 incident, the PVC airlines were replaced with steel reinforced air hoses {{to prevent a}} similar accident from occurring. After the 2004 incident, metal bars were installed {{on both sides of}} the “T-bar” restraint, encasing the rider's legs. Shin restraints were added to the lower portion of the restraint, preventing riders’ feet from leaving the car. In addition, all of the seat belts on both 36-passenger trains were replaced with ones at a consistent length, as well as a “go or no go” belt for each seat and “T-bar” restraint. The “go or no go” belt ensured the “T-bar” restraint was in an effective position before leaving the station. During the 2009 rebranding, new trains were deployed with new restraints added. The new lapbars eliminated the center pole, leaving only the exterior poles. New seat belts <b>provided</b> <b>more</b> strength and were less likely to come undone unintentionally.|$|E

5|$|The first V-22 was {{rolled out}} with {{significant}} media attention in May 1988. The project suffered several blows. That year, the U.S. Army left the program, citing {{a need to}} focus its budget on more immediate aviation programs. In 1989, the project survived two separate votes in the Senate that could have resulted in cancellation. Despite the Senate's decision, the Department of Defense instructed the U.S. Navy not {{to spend more money}} on the V-22. When the V-22's projected development budget greatly increased in 1988, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney tried to remove funding from 1989 to 1992 in an effort to cancel it. He was eventually overruled by Congress, which provided unrequested funding for the program. Multiple studies of alternatives found the V-22 <b>provided</b> <b>more</b> capability and combat effectiveness with similar operating costs. The Clinton Administration was supportive of the V-22 and helped it attain funding.|$|E
5|$|The map of Georgia is {{actually}} a compilation of numerous geological studies and mapping projects that occurred throughout the state and over an extended time period. The major studies that are cited for contribution to the state geologic map fall under three main categories: New mapping by the Georgia Geological Survey, new mapping by the Georgia Geological Survey combined with revised published maps, and published maps with compilation revision only. The majority of the rock units shown on the 1976 map were mapped in 1973 by reconnaissance methods. For some areas, previous authors <b>provided</b> <b>more</b> detailed work than the reconnaissance conducted by the geological survey staff. In those areas, the original author’s work was used in compiling the state map.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture in {{the area}} was spurred by food and fodder {{shortages}} during the winters of 1913, 1915, and 1916. Fairbanks businessmen also encouraged the growth of farming. Wickersham <b>provided</b> <b>more</b> funding for the experimental farm, the Tanana Valley Railroad provided free grain seed acquired from an experimental farm in Sweden, and William Fentress Thompson, editor of the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, wrote frequent editorials {{in favor of more}} farming. Prominent Fairbanks businessmen formed the Alaska Loyal League, a group that encouraged farming. Farmers also created the Tanana Valley State Fair in 1924 to demonstrate their agricultural success. It is Alaska's oldest state fair and still operates today. Despite these moves, the agriculture movement in Fairbanks had only limited success. A farmers' bank established in 1917 to provide loans for equipment purchases went out of business two years later, and although the Alaska Railroad allowed for cheaper shipment of tractors and other agricultural equipment, it also permitted a steady supply of food shipments to Fairbanks. In 1929, Alaska farms met only about 10 percent of the state's food demand. By 1931, the University of Alaska had grown {{to the point that the}} experimental farm was annexed by the school.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1994, United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt first {{proposed}} {{the removal of}} several Pacific Northwest dams because of their impact on salmon spawning. The Northwest Power Planning Council approved a plan that <b>provided</b> <b>more</b> water for fish and less for electricity, irrigation, and transportation. Environmental advocates have called {{for the removal of}} certain dams in the Columbia system in the years since. Of the 227major dams in the Columbia River drainage basin, the four Washington dams on the lower Snake River are often identified for removal, for example in an ongoing lawsuit concerning a Bush administration plan for salmon recovery. These dams and reservoirs limit the recovery of upriver salmon runs to Idaho's Salmon and Clearwater rivers. Historically, the Snake produced over 1.5million spring and summer Chinook salmon, a number that has dwindled to several thousand in recent years. Idaho Power Company's Hells Canyon dams have no fish ladders (and do not pass juvenile salmon downstream), and thus allow no steelhead or salmon to migrate above Hells Canyon. In 2007, the destruction of the Marmot Dam on the Sandy River was the first dam removal in the system. Other Columbia Basin dams that have been removed include Condit Dam on Washington's White Salmon River, and the Milltown Dam on the Clark Fork in Montana.|$|E
5|$|At the {{suggestion}} of C. J. Gorter, the team attempted to use an oscillating field. This {{became the basis for}} the nuclear magnetic resonance method. In 1937, Rabi, Kusch, Millman and Zacharias used it to measure the magnetic moment of several lithium compounds with molecular beams, including lithium chloride, lithium fluoride and dilithium. Applying the method to hydrogen, they found that the moment of a proton was 2.785±0.02 nuclear magnetons, and not 1 as predicted by the then-current theory, while that of a deuteron was 0.855±0.006 nuclear magnetons. This <b>provided</b> <b>more</b> accurate measurements of what Stern's team had found, and Rabi's team had confirmed, in 1934. Since a deuteron is composed of a proton and a neutron with aligned spins, the neutron's magnetic moment could be inferred by subtracting the proton's magnetic moment from the deuteron's. The resulting value was not zero, and had a sign opposite to that of the proton. Based on curious artifacts of these more accurate measurements, Rabi suggested that the deuteron had an electric quadrupole moment. This discovery meant that the physical shape of the deuteron was not symmetric, which provided valuable insight into the nature of the nuclear force binding nucleons. For the creation of the molecular-beam magnetic-resonance detection method, Rabi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the visuals and audio, the overall gameplay system remained mostly unchanged from that used since Final Fantasy V, using research done to promote player control. The initial decision was for battles to feature shifting camera angles. Battle arenas had a lower polygon count than field areas, which made picking out distinctive features for each one more difficult. The summon sequences benefited strongly from the switch to the cinematic style, as the team had struggled to portray their scale using 2D graphics. In his role as producer, Sakaguchi placed much of his effort into developing the battle system, also proposing the Materia system. Materia <b>provided</b> <b>more</b> character customization than previous Final Fantasy games: battles no longer revolved around characters with innate skills and roles in battle, as Materia could be reconfigured between battles. Nomura {{also contributed to the}} gameplay, creating the Limit Break system as an evolution of the Desperation Attacks used in Final Fantasy VI. The Limit Breaks served a purpose in gameplay while also bringing out each character's personality in battle.|$|E
