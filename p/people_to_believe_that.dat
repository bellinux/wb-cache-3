25|$|A bust and {{historical}} plaque marks her birthplace in Toronto, now {{the site of}} the Hospital for Sick Children. The plaque was unveiled by her husband Buddy Rogers in 1973. The bust by artist Eino Gira was added ten years later. Her date of birth on the plaque is April 8, 1893. This can only be assumed to be because her date of birth was never registered – and throughout her life, beginning as a child, she led many <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> she was a year younger so she would appear to be more of an acting prodigy and continue to be cast in younger roles, which were more plentiful in the theatre.|$|E

For this reason, individuals may fall victim to knowledge neglect simply because they aren't expecting that what they are being told or reading about will be incorrect.|$|R

25|$|Chinese {{women were}} scarce in every place where Chinese indentured laborers were brought, the {{migration}} {{was dominated by}} Chinese men. Up to the 1940s men made up {{the vast majority of}} the Costa Rican Chinese community. Males made up the majority of the original Chinese community in Mexico and they married Mexican women. One stark difference between Indian and Chinese Coolies was the treatment of women, despite both groups having a severe shortage. Though there were crimes against women and women being murdered, these incidents were nowhere near as frequent as with Indian Coolies. Though this was because there were so few Chinese, it became common for <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Indians murder their women while Chinese women stay alive because, unlike their Indian counterparts, they are chaste.|$|E
25|$|According {{to modern}} Feminists, {{women and girls}} {{are more prone to}} {{trafficking}} also because of social norms that marginalize their value and status in society. By this perspective females face considerable gender discrimination both at home and in school. Stereotypes that women belong at home in the private sphere and that women are less valuable because they do not and are not allowed to contribute to formal employment and monetary gains the same way men do further marginalize women's status relative to men. Some religious beliefs also lead <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the birth of girls are a result of bad karma, further cementing the belief that girls are not as valuable as boys. It is generally regarded by feminists that various social norms contribute to women's inferior position and lack of agency and knowledge, thus making them vulnerable to exploitation such as sex trafficking.|$|E
25|$|In Wright's 2005 demonstration, the {{creature}} {{with which he}} began looked remarkably similar to his earlier microbe. This led many <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{the creature}} was based upon the microbe's appearance. However, in a 2006 video from E3, narrated by a senior programmer, {{it was said that}} the player will initially begin as a slug-like animal. The narrator further stated the reason for this was to allow for more player creativity. This created uncertainty as to which method would be used in the final game; particularly as a later video demonstrated the essence of the cell creature emerging from a pond. The 2007 TED Presentation in March 2007 again depicted a legless, slug-like creature emerging from the water, leaving a trail of slime in its wake. The cellular phase was renamed as the tide pool phase, then called the cell phase months later. The final phases: Cell, Creature, Tribal, Civilization and Space were the five available stages at the final release of Spore.|$|E

Instead, Steve Harmison bowled a maiden over first up to Justin Langer, and Matthew Hayden holed out to Harmison's new-ball partner Matthew Hoggard for a golden duck – the first of Hayden's career. The {{dismissal}} was to set the tone of the innings. Although Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer hit runs just as quickly as England had done, the umpire's finger went up twice more before lunch – Ponting swept to the opposing captain Vaughan for 61, and Damien Martyn was run out taking a risky single for 20. Once again, Vaughan was in the action, hitting the stumps with a throw from mid off. Langer and Michael Clarke continued after lunch in the same vein, but again, a couple of quick wickets – Clarke edging a quicker ball from Ashley Giles behind and Simon Katich falling in the same way to Andrew Flintoff swung it England's way. At 208 for 5, the Australians were struggling, but another good partnership between Langer and Gilchrist saw them to tea with no further loss.|$|E

500|$|On 20 August 1934 Downes became Director General of Medical Services (DGMS), a {{full-time}} post and the Army's most senior medical officer. His priority was a recruiting campaign {{to increase the}} number of medical professionals in the Army. [...] The Munich Crisis caused <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> another war was imminent, and an Army-wide recruiting campaign led by Major General Sir Thomas Blamey doubled the size of the Army from 35,000 in 1938 to 70,000 in 1939. Downes' efforts at recruiting were far more modest. In 1934, there were 299 part-time officers in the AAMC; by 1939 there were 394, and increase of only 32 per cent. This included 320 medical practitioners, 37 dentists and 13 pharmacists. Downes was acutely aware that a large Army would require mobilisation of the country's doctors, and pushed for all doctors to be prepared for either military service or direction by civil authorities. He presided over a major effort to stockpile drugs and medical equipment required for a mobilisation. With the help of the Department of Health and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, most of this was delivered by July 1939.|$|E

500|$|Starting at the {{beginning}} of July 1992, Gaven appeared in a new musical called The Who's Tommy at La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego. It was based on the rock opera album Tommy by The Who. Gaven starred as Mrs. Walker, the mother of the boy Tommy who is traumatized when he sees his father murder Mrs. Walker's new boyfriend. Tommy ultimately becomes non-responsive, leading <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he is deaf, mute, and blind, and his parents try to find a cure for his condition. Gaven later told TheaterWeek that she initially did not want to do the musical, since she [...] "had no idea how this could be staged as a theatrical piece. I hoped my agents wouldn't call me and ask me to audition." [...] However, they did, and she was cast as Mrs. Walker after an audition in which she sang the song [...] "Heaven Help My Heart" [...] that she performed in Chess, also a rock musical. The Who's Tommy was La Jolla Playhouse's biggest success yet and as a result its run was lengthened by several weeks. Later that year, Gaven once again played Doris in Here's Love—this time in a Theatre Under The Stars production.|$|E
500|$|Writing in London's Evening Standard on 5 January 2011, media {{commentator}} Roy Greenslade {{expressed concern}} {{over a number}} of negative articles that had appeared in newspapers concerning Yeates' landlord, Jefferies, following his arrest, describing the coverage as [...] "character assassination on a large scale". He cited several examples of headlines and stories that had been published, including a headline in The Sun describing Jefferies– a former schoolmaster at Clifton College– as weird, posh, lewd and creepy; a story from the Daily Express quoting unnamed former pupils referring to him as [...] "... a sort of Nutty Professor" [...] who made them feel [...] "creeped out" [...] by his [...] "strange" [...] behaviour; and an article from the Daily Telegraph, which reported Jefferies [...] "has been described by pupils at Clifton College ... as a fan of dark and violent avant-garde films". Jefferies launched legal action against six newspapers on 21 April– The Sun, the Daily Mirror, the Daily Star, the Daily Express, the Daily Mail and the Daily Record– seeking damages for libel. It was held that the media were quick to jump to conclusions regarding Jefferies' arrest. Being a retired English teacher who lived alone, whose physical appearance and [...] "eccentrically unkempt white hair," [...] made him stand out, led <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he looked the type.
