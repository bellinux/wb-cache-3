Thus, {{there is a direct}} mathematical relationship between the pressure and the speed, so if one knows the speed at all points within the airflow one can calculate the pressure, and vice versa. For any airfoil generating lift, there must be a <b>pressure</b> <b>imbalance,</b> i.e. lower average air pressure on the top than on the bottom.

50|$|Decorative {{fountain}} systems employ fluid amplifiers {{to generate}} their decorative displays and effects. Fluid amplifiers {{rely on a}} fluid control stream to switch a fluid power stream. Fluid amplifiers are so named because a low-energy fluid control signal can control and switch a high-energy fluid power stream to produce an output signal of higher energy level than the fluid control signal. In fluid amplifiers, a fluid power stream, after leaving a nozzle, is switched selectively {{to one or more}} of a plurality of outlet passages. This may be done by supplying fluid control pressure continuously, or as a pulse, to one of the control ports at the exit end of the nozzle until the high-energy power stream is diverted. Alternatively, switching may be effected by closing the other control port so that the fluid that is flowing in through one control port from the atmosphere or some other source will create a sufficient fluid <b>pressure</b> <b>imbalance</b> adjacent the exit end of the nozzle to effect switching of the fluid power stream.|$|E
5000|$|The {{champagne}} {{model is}} {{perhaps one of}} the first numerical calculations of the propagation of ionisation fronts and of the expansion of HII regions that did not assumed a constant density medium around the massive exciting star. The model assumes that star formation takes place in a dense cloud, surrounded and in pressure equilibrium with a low density inter-cloud gas.The ample supply of UV photons generated by the star rapidly establishes an HII region and the expansion of this, sooner or later allows also for the ionisation of the inter cloud gas. Ionisation disrupts then the former pressure balance between the cloud and the inter-cloud gas as under the stellar radiation field all photo-ionised gas acquires a temperature of the order of 10000 K.In this way, the ionised cloud material acquires an excess pressure, a pressure larger than the ionised low density inter cloud gas and this provoques the supersonic expansion of the ionised cloud matter into the surrounding gas (the champagne flow). The streaming of matter out of the cloud allows for the ionisation of a larger portion of the original cloud susteining in this way the <b>pressure</b> <b>imbalance</b> which eventually leads to the complete disruptionof the parent cloud. The terms champagne model and champagne flow were coined by Guillermo Tenorio-Tagle in a paper in 1979 (Astronomy and Astrophysics 1979A&A....71...59T).The model focus on the size, velocity field and the large density variations observed in HII regions.

One method of studying these effects and how the driver responds is via driving simulator studies.

The present work presents a simplified real time model of the moments and forces acting in an overtaking situation due to aerodynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>imbalances.</b> The model is compared with experimentally validated Navier-Stokes solutions.

Here we investigate the role of hydrostatic forces in glacier calving.

Our model provides theoretical estimates of the importance of each effect and suggests geometric and material conditions under which a given glacier will calve from hydrostatic flexure. We find good agreement with observations.

The two parameters of the model are {{the growth rate of}} the jet angle by a <b>pressure</b> <b>imbalance</b> and the delay time for the destruction of this <b>pressure</b> <b>imbalance.</b> We present closed relations for both model constants {{as a function of the}} jet Reynolds number Re, the inlet velocity vin, the cavity width W, and the cavity width over inlet diameter W/d and we demonstrate that these model constants do not depend on other geometric ratios. The model and the obtained model constants have been successfully validated against three dimensional large eddy simulations, and planar particle image velocimetry measurements, for 1600 < Re ? 7100 and 20 ?

40|$|We {{have used}} the Deep Survey {{telescope}} of EUVE to investigate shadows in the diffuse EUV/Soft X-Ray background cast by clouds in the interstellar medium. We confirm {{the existence of a}} shadow previously reported, and provide evidence for two new shadows. We used IRAS data to identify the clouds producing these shadows and to determine their optical depth to EUV radiation. The EUV-absorbing clouds are optically thick in the EUV, and all EUV emission detected in the direction of these shadows must be produced from material in front of the clouds. We obtained new optical data to determine the distance to these clouds. We use a new differential cloud technique to obtain the pressure of the interstellar medium. These results do not depend on any zero level calibration of the data. Our results provide evidence that the pressure of the hot interstellar gas is the same in three different directions in the local interstellar medium, and is at least 8 times higher than derived for the local cloud surrounding our Sun. This provides new evidence for large thermal <b>pressure</b> <b>imbalances</b> in the local ISM, and directly contradicts the basic assumption of thermal pressure equilibrium used in almost all present models of the interstellar medium.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{time-dependent}} photoionization of low density gaseous nebulae subjected to sudden changes in the intensity of ionizing radiation. To this end, we write a computer code that solves the full time-dependent energy balance, ionization balance, and radiation transfer equations in a self-consistent fashion for a simplified pure hydrogen case. It is shown that changes in the ionizing radiation yield ionization/thermal fronts that propagate through the cloud, but the propagation times and response times to such fronts vary widely and non-linearly from the illuminated face of the cloud to the ionization front (IF). Ionization/thermal fronts are often supersonic, and in slabs initially in pressure equilibrium such fronts yield large <b>pressure</b> <b>imbalances</b> {{that are likely to}} produce important dynamical effects in the cloud. Further, we studied the case of periodic variations in the ionizing flux. It is found that the physical conditions of the plasma have complex behaviors that differ from any steady-state solutions. Moreover, even the time average ionization and temperature is different from any steady-state case. This time average is characterized by over-ionization and a broader IF with respect to the steady-state solution for a mean value of the radiation flux. Around the time average of physical conditions there is large dispersion in instantaneous conditions, particularly across the IF, which increases with the period of radiation flux variations. Moreover, the variations in physical conditions are asynchronous along the slab due to the combination of non-linear propagation times for thermal/ionization fronts and equilibration times.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} analyse {{the stability}} of a propagating interface between two competing tissues in which cell division and death are mechanically regulated. The interface between the tissues is either driven by homeostatic pressure differences or by cell motility. An interface driven by homeostatic <b>pressure</b> <b>imbalance</b> experiences a Saffman-Taylor-like instability involving the tissues' substrate frictions, and a separate long-wavelength instability related to an effective viscosity of cell number change. When interface propagation arises from directed cell motility, a further instability depends on the strength and direction of motility forces in each tissue. Each of these mechanisms can equally well exert stabilising effects, hence providing means for mechanical feedback to promote orderly interface propagation in developing tissues.

40|$|By {{removing}} air distribution and conditioning equipment from unconditioned spaces, homeowners stand to benefit substantially {{with respect to}} both energy savings and indoor air quality. Duct leakage introduces: Greater heating and cooling loads from air at extreme temperatures and humidity levels; Outside air and air from unconditioned spaces that may contain air borne contaminants, combustion gases, pollen, mold spores, and/or particles of building materials; and Higher whole-house infiltration/exfiltration rates. Exemplary studies conducted since 1990 have demonstrated the prevalence of duct leakage throughout the United States and measured energy savings of approximately 20 % during both heating and cooling seasons from leakage reduction. These all dealt with duct leakage to and/or from unconditioned spaces. In the building science community, leakage within the conditioned space is generally presumed to eliminate {{the negative consequences of}} duct leakage with the exception of possibly creating <b>pressure</b> <b>imbalances</b> in the house which relates to higher infiltration and/or exfiltration. The practical challenges of isolating ducts and air handlers from unconditioned spaces require builders to construct an air-tight environment for the ducts. Florida Solar Energy Center researchers worked with four builders in Texas, North Carolina, and Florida who build a furred-down chase located either in a central hallway or at the edges of rooms as an architectural detail. Some comparison homes with duct systems in attics and crawl spaces were included in the test group of more than 20 homes. Test data reveals that all of the duct/AHU systems built inside the conditioned space had lower duct leakage to unconditioned spaces than their conventional counterparts; however, none of the homes was completely free of duct leakage to unconditioned spaces. Common problems included wiring and plumbing penetrations of the chase, failure to treat the chase as an air tight space, and misguided fresh air inlet design. Improvements were implemented by the Texas builder and retested in July. Results showed a 36 % reduction in duct leakage, significant enough to warrant the builder adopting the new sealing procedure...|$|R

40|$|Magnetohydrodynamic {{compressive}} fluctuations of the {{interplanetary plasma}} {{in the region}} from 0. 3 to 1 AU have been characterized {{in terms of their}} polytropic index. Following Chandrasekhar's approach to polytropic fluids, this index has been determined through a fit of the observed variations of density and temperature. At least three different classes of fluctuations have been identified: (1) variations at constant thermal pressure, in low-speed solar wind and without a significant dependence on distance, (2) adiabatic variations, mainly close to 1 AU and without a relevant dependence on wind speed, and (3) variations at nearly constant density, in fast wind close to 0. 3 AU. Variations at constant thermal pressure are probably a subset of the ensemble of total-pressure balanced structures, corresponding to cases in which the magnetic field magnitude does not vary appreciably throughout the structure. In this case the pressure equilibrium has to be assured by its thermal component only. The variations may be related to small flow-tubes with approximately the same magnetic-field intensity, convected by the wind in conditions of pressure equilibrium. This feature is mainly observed in low-velocity solar wind, in agreement with the magnetic topology (small open flow-tubes emerging through an ensemble of closed structures) expected for the source region of slow wind. Variations of adiabatic type may be related to magnetosonic waves excited by <b>pressure</b> <b>imbalances</b> between contiguous flow-tubes. Such imbalances are probably built up by interactions between wind flows with different speeds in the spiral geometry induced by the solar rotation. This may account for {{the fact that they are}} mainly found at a large distance from the sun. Temperature variations at almost constant density are mostly found in fast flows close to the sun. These are the solar wind regions with the best examples of incompressible behaviour. They are characterized by very stable values for particle density and magnetic intensity, and by fluctuations of Alfvénic type. It is likely that temperature fluctuations in these regions are a remnant of thermal features in the low solar atmosphere. In conclusion, the polytropic index appears to be a useful tool to understand the nature of the compressive turbulence in the interplanetary plasma, as far as the frozen-in magnetic field does not play a crucial role...|$|R
