In this article, {{a study on}} Ag-In solder for chip-to-chip thermocompression bonding was carried out. The resulting joint consists of AgIn 2 and Ag 9 In 4 phases, with the latter phase having a melting temperature higher than 400 C. Complete consumption of In solder into a Ag-rich intermetallic compound is achieved by applying a bond pressure of 1. 4 MPa at 180 C for 40 min. We also observe that the bonding pressure effect enables a Ag-rich phase to be formed within a shorter bonding duration (10 min) at a higher pressure of 1. 6 MPa.

40|$|We use a {{mesoscale}} simulation {{approach to}} explore the impact of different capsid geometries on the <b>packagin</b> and ejection dynamics of polymers of different flexibility. We find that both packing and ejection times are faster for flexible polymers. For such polymers a sphere packs more quickly and ejects more slowly than an ellipsoid. For semiflexible polymers, however, the case relevant to DNA, a sphere both packs and ejects more easily. We interpret our results by considering both the thermodynamics and the relaxational dynamics of the polymers. The predictions could be tested with biomimetic experiments with synthetic polymers inside artificial vesicles.

40|$|These days, {{sustainability}} {{is widely}} understood to address three components; economic, {{environmental and social}} sustainability. Ongoing research efforts {{in the field of}} sustainable packaging focus on the development of tools and methodologies that address multiple criteria decision making in the packaging design process. These efforts mainly apply to simultaneously addressing environmental and economical considerations using eco-efficiency considerations. The social component of sustainability has not yet found its way into such efficiency considerations, and designers do not have a tool repertoire at their disposal when making trade-offs including social considerations. This does not mean that social sustainability is not an element of packaging design. In this paper, the question is raised whether social sustainability needs to be considered in the context of regular packaging development, and if so, how? Different aspects that may be related to socially sustainable packaging will be discussed, and a definition will be proposed.

40|$|ABSTRACT Packaging {{in medical}} {{instruments}} {{is important for}} maintaining sterility. At {{the end of a}} correct sterilization process, products inside the sterilizer chamber are sterile. In a hospital or clinic it is important that all medical instruments used for treating patients are absolutely safe for use, the chance for spreading of diseases should be kept as small as pos-sible The air in the room where the sterilizer is installed contains dust particles, which may carry micro-organisms. So when taking out the load from the sterilizer, it soon will be contaminated again. In addition usually sterile goods are stored for quite some time before they are used, and moreover they are transported through the hospital to the place they are to be used. when not protected, the goods will definitely be decontaminated by the time they are used [...] The proper selection, use, and performance of sterilization packaging systems is crucial to achieve sterilization of the package contents, maintain sterility of the contents until the package is opened for use, and permit removal of the contents without contamination An overview: antimicrobial <b>packagin...</b>|$|E

40|$|DAS Photonics S. L., Camino de Vera s/n 46022 Valencia (Spain) Efficient {{packaging}} in silicon photonics {{requires a}} previous development of high performance fiber coupling structures. One {{of the most}} suitable fiber coupling structures in silicon is the grating coupler. Main advantages of using such a vertical coupling technique with respect to horizontal techniques are fiber alignment tolerances and wafer scale testing. We report design, fabrication and experimental measurements of conventional SOI grating couplers. Around 40 % coupling efficiency is obtained when coupling a standard singlemode fiber to a singlemode SOI waveguide with 250 nmx 500 nm section dimensions, with a fiber tilt angle of 10 º. With respect to alignment tolerances, the variation effect of different fiber positions in the grating plane was evaluated as well as different tilt angles. It was obtained that coupling efficiency is almost constant for angle errors of ± 2 º. In addition, a tolerance of fiber position deviations of about ± 2 μm was reached, making possible multifiber alignments {{with the use of}} standard fiber-arrays. As the obtained vertical orientation is not always easy to adapt to standard layouts, we also introduce here a solution for allowing the use of standard DIL or butterfly packages with horizontal orientation, illustrating the design concepts and briefly describing the technologies involved.

40|$|Faraday-effect optical-fibre current sensors have {{a number}} of {{well-known}} advantages for use in high-voltage transmission systems and other hostile environments. However, these applications have been restricted by the presence of linear birefringence in the fibre which adversely interacts with the Faraday polarisation rotation produced by magnetic fields. Linear birefringence results from (a) intrinsic effects within the fibre (ellipticity, inbuilt thermal-stress) and (b) packaging and coiling which introduces transverse pressure and bends. The first of these can be eliminated by spinning a moderately-birefringent conventional fibre during the draw to produce a fibre with negligible intrinsic linear birefringence. However, the fibre remains just as sensitive to externally-induced birefringence caused by coiling. A complete solution to this problem is to design fibres with a large circular birefringence which overwhelms the perturbations caused by linear birefringence and thus permits the full Faraday rotation to be observed. Helical fibres have this property, but are large in diameter which restricts their application to coils of about 15 cm radius. Moreover, care is required in launching and splicing. We report here an alternative approach which appears particularly suited to applications requiring multi-turn, small-diameter coils. A highly-birefringent Bow-Tie fibre is rapidly spun during the draw to produce a fibre which exhibits a large elliptical birefringence. Unlike the unspun Bow-Tie fibre, the fibre now exhibits a magnetic field sensitivity. In addition, just as in a normal birefringent-fibre, the fibre is resistant to polarisation mode-coupling effects and therefore the current sensitivity is largely unaffected by <b>packagin...</b>|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of latest data {{published}} by Eurostat (the statistical office of the EU) in 2008 Europe produced 80 million tons of packaging waste. Specifically, Italy produces about 12 million tons per year of waste from packaging, 2 / 3 of which derive from the food processing sector. This paper {{does not address the}} issue of proper disposal of waste by consumers; on the contrary, it studies the problem of the waste that occurs before the products distribution phase, since it has not been sufficiently addressed enough. The focus, therefore, pertains to pre-production phase in the food packaging industry. Currently, rejects generated by that sector represent a large amount of waste upstream of the primary production cycle. Through its more exhaustive and far-sighted analysis and the application of the methodology of Systemic Design, whose fundamental principle is that waste (output) of a process become the resource (input) to another one, pre-production waste can in fact be reused by other industries. This generates a virtuous network of exchanges between geographically close companies that achieve economic and environmental benefits from the sale of secondary raw material. The result ends in a less use of raw materials, an increased use of resources already on site and, consequently, in a greater traceability of the same resources used in industrial processes so as to ensure, by implication, a high quality finished product. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to design a self-sustaining network of companies that can interface and confront each other by creating a virtuous cycle in order to exploit the resources available (output) and limit production of surplus <b>packagin...</b>|$|E
40|$|The virion-associated genome {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 consists of a noncovalently linked dimer of two identical, unspliced RNA molecules. A hairpin structure within the untranslated leader transcript is postulated {{to play a role}} in RNA dimerization through base pairing of the autocomplementary loop sequences. This hairpin motif with the palindromic loop sequence is referred to as the dimer initiation site (DIS), and the type of interaction is termed loop-loop kissing. Detailed phylogenetic analysis of the DIS motifs in different human and simian immunodeficiency viruses revealed conservation of the hairpin structure with a 6 -mer palindrome in the loop, despite considerable sequence divergence. This finding supports the loop-loop kissing mechanism. To test this possibility, proviral genomes with mutations in the DIS palindrome were constructed. The appearance of infectious virus upon transfection into SupT 1 T cells was delayed for the DIS mutants compared with that obtained by transfection of the wild-type provirus (pLAI), confirming that this RNA motif plays an important role in virus replication. Surprisingly, the RNA genome extracted from mutant virions was found to be fully dimeric and to have a normal thermal stability. These results indicate that the DIS motif is not essential for {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 RNA dimerization and suggest that DIS base pairing does not contribute to the stability of the mature RNA dimer. Instead, we measured a reduction in the amount of viral RNA encapsidated in the mutant virions, suggesting a role of the DIS motif in RNA packaging. This result correlates with the idea that the processes of RNA dimerization and packaging are intrinsically linked, and we propose that DIS pairing is a prerequisite for RNA <b>packagin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Because some {{consumers}} have expressed {{reservations about the}} use of carbon monoxide for fresh meat packaging, we hypothesized that providing consumers with factual information about this packaging technology would alleviate consumer fears and biases concerning carbon monoxide, and improve consumer acceptance of carbon monoxide in meat packaging. Consumers were given opportunities to purchase ground beef with three choices of product color (bright red, light red or reddish brown), three hypothetical shelf life differences (3, 5 or 14 days) and three prices ($ 2. 85, $ 3. 05 or $ 3. 25) both before and after information on packaging with carbon monoxide was provided. Following the initial purchasing experiment, the information on carbon monoxide describing the bright red color and extended shelf life achieved by this packaging technology was provided, and the purchasing experiment repeated to test the impact of communicating with consumers about carbon monoxide packaging. The results showed that consumers were willing to pay $ 0. 16 per pound for each level of improved color of ground beef. There was no purchasing preference for 5 -day shelf life over 3 -day shelf life but consumers were willing to pay $ 0. 36 per pound more for the 14 -day shelf life. After information about carbon monoxide packaging as a means of providing improved color and shelf life was provided, willingness to pay declined to $ 0. 05 per pound for color and $ 0. 13 per pound for shelf life improvement. While the willingness to pay was less following information about carbon monoxide, it was still positive for those product attributes. These results suggest that strategies forimprovement of consumer attitudes concerning carbon monoxide packaging may need to do more than simply communicate the advantages of the technology.
