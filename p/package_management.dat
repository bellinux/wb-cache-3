40|$|Packaging is a {{fundamental}} element in logistics, which significantly affects costs and efficiency of logistics activities. Returnable and reusable packaging items are seen as corporate assets and capital investments for companies. However, one problem regarding returnable <b>packaging</b> <b>management</b> is that companies usually have weak visibility and control over them especially in extensive supply chain networks. The purpose of control is to assure returning of assets, satisfy service level and make sure to utilize packaging efficiently. The cores of this study constitute identifying important factors in business models regarding <b>packaging</b> <b>management,</b> and evaluation of their efficiency based on critical performance indicators i. e. leakage and turnaround time in the network. Therefore, this study first created an analytical framework {{in order to provide}} holistic view over packaging systems and their management by combining different elements in the packaging control systems. The six important dimensions of the framework are loop design, packaging ownership types, pool control systems, order management, network design and tracking systems. Then this study analyzes the efficiency of the packaging pool at Volvo Logistics Services and finally provides recommended solutions to achieve higher level of control in their <b>packaging</b> <b>management</b> system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Problem Little {{research}} has been conducted on how packaging and returnable packaging are managed within suppliers in the Scandinavian automotive supply chain. Sources also propose that returnable packaging is dealt with inefficiently within the automotive suppliers.    Purpose The purpose of the thesis is to explore and analyze how packaging and returnable packaging are managed within suppliers in the ASC. It also aims to identify perceived important factors for efficient returnable <b>packaging</b> <b>management</b> from the perspective of suppliers, sub-suppliers and OEMs. Method The research is based on a holistic single case study. Further, it adopts the inductive approach and exploratory purpose. Data collection is facilitated by qualitative methods, using ten semi-structured interviews and four on-site observations. Conclusion Packaging was found to be managed somewhat differently in the internal, outbound and inbound flows. Non-returnable and returnable packaging was found used in all flows at different ratios. Further, several factors were regarded important for efficient returnable <b>packaging</b> <b>management.</b> These were found specific for the internal, outbound and inbound flows and further divided into fundamental and efficiency factors...|$|R
