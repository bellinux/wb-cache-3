5|$|Economic {{conditions}} have fluctuated {{with the changing}} price of oil since 1985, for example during and following the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>crisis</b> of 1990–91. With its highly developed communication and transport facilities, Bahrain {{is home to a}} number of multinational firms and construction proceeds on several major industrial projects. A large share of exports consist of petroleum products made from imported crude oil, which accounted for 51% of the country's imports in 2007. Bahrain depends heavily on food imports to feed its growing population; it relies heavily on meat imports from Australia and also imports 75% of its total fruit consumption needs. Since only 2.9% of the country's land is arable, agriculture contributes to 0.5% of Bahrain's GDP. In 2004, Bahrain signed the US-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement, which will reduce certain trade barriers between the two nations. Due to the combination of the global financial crisis and the recent unrest, the growth rate decreased to 2.2% which is the lowest growth rate since 1994.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the very}} first {{beginnings}} of American popular culture, just about every other race or culture-"other" generally referring to all those outside of the category of White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, Americans-has {{at one point or}} another fallen victim to being stereotyped. This study is an attempt to explore some of the easily recognizable and prevalent stereotypes that have been widely circulated by America's popular culture. By doing so, it is hoped that this study will serve to enhance a greater awareness of the existence of stereotypes as well as to reveal some of the possible causes and potentially powerful effects. Most recently, {{over the course of the}} recent <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> War <b>Crisis,</b> when our nation was forced to focus on the Middle East and the Arabs who inhabit it, it became painfully apparent that there are complex people and unique cultures that actually exist beyond and outside the narrow-minded, one dimensional parameters of the Arab stereotype. Yet, once Kuwait was liberated and American troops started returning home from the gulf, America was left with the indelible impression that all Arabs are nothing more than irrational, violent, uncivilized, and untrustworthy inhabitants of a politically and economically important desert. Theoretically then, a seemingly simple question such as, "What actually 'is' an Arab?" goes insufficiently and unfairly answered since most people know so little about Arabs and what is known is hardly related to reality. The knowledge most readily available is oftentimes limited to generalized, biased, and possibly distorted or inaccurate stereotypes portrayed and perpetuated by pop culture...|$|R

40|$|My {{objective}} {{for doing}} {{this study is to}} investigate the name of this sea (<b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf)</b> historically and to prove the correctness and originality of the name of <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> in the course of history. The <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf,</b> from the beginning of human history till now, was controlled by Iran either on its northern or southern borders and Iran has always had rule over this sea. All historical resources, either those of Greek origins from more than 2500 years ago or Roman and Islamic ones, have admitted the name of <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> as the true name of it. In different encyclopedias and atlas of the 20 th century, it is only the name of <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> which is used for this sea. But after Arabs’ defeat from Israel in the year 1967 and Iran's non cooperation with Arabs in boycotting the sale of oil to Israel, Naser (the then president of Egypt) and leaders of other Arab countries changed the name of <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> in their official correspondences among themselves in order to take their revenge upon Iran. Changing the name of <b>Persians</b> <b>Gulf</b> has been posed since that time. But, the name of <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> has always been frequently used in the official reports and records of different countries such as Iran, Middle eastern countries, Europe, America and other countries and even at the same time, the same name is used by them. It is enough proof to show that Arabs’ attempt to change the name of <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> is baseless. In this article, it is proven that the name of this sea has been <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> in different historical records from the being of time. The attempt by some Arabic countries to change the name of <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> is futile and without any historical evidence. United Nation and the important geographic institutes have recorded and used the name of this sea as the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> which is the original name of this sea. ...|$|R
