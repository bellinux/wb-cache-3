The railway station had closed to passenger traffic in 1965 and to goods four years later. British Rail had contracted for the clearing of the site, {{part of the deal}} being that the contractors would sell and retain the <b>proceeds</b> from <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the materials and scrap.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{language}} development is quite complex, it occurs under {{the interactions between}} diachronic derivation and synchronic derivation. This paper examines the development of Chinese language through the scope <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> construction to provide evidence that diachronic and synchronic derivations could affect {{the development of a}} language simultaneously. From the progression <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> prepositions in Mandarin based on historical documents, we can observe how diachronic derivation took place. Also, through diachronic derivation, {{it is safe to say}} that the earlier sentence structures can have an impact on later sentence structures. By comparing the disposal constructions between Mandarin and Min dialect, the syntactic characteristics and limitations present the possibility of synchronic derivation, which is the result of language contact. The findings of this paper demonstrates the features of language contact through the borrowing <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> prepositions, and the similarities and differences between the syntax <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> sentence structure <b>of</b> Mandarin and Min dialect...|$|R

In response, {{the purpose of this study}} is to develop a Generic Framework for Estimation of the Cost <b>of</b> <b>Disposal,</b> identifying all requirements, inputs and best practices techniques for a major defence company. Current cost estimation methods appear to miss out some of the uncertainties involved, or simply assumes a triangular distribution with a default setting of plus or minus 10 %. In order to address this current poor consideration of all cost uncertainties, more than 200 academic papers have been reviewed to develop a structured Framework, which provides the necessary level of information to generate a more appropriate evaluation of the true Cost <b>of</b> <b>Disposal</b> for a range of industries, including Defence, Aerospace, Marine, Nuclear, Oil & Chemical and Automotive. In this study, Uncertainty and Risk Analysis has been more fully embedded in the concept framework to better capture a greater number <b>of</b> <b>Disposal</b> Cost implications, whilst allowing comparison of differing cost scenarios. This will naturally improve the decision-making throughout the product Whole Life Cycle. Furthermore, this project analysed a number of real case scenarios from the Aerospace industry, so as to test the tools validity, thanks to the collaboration of senior decision-makers in the field. This process will provide the user company with a better understanding of the framework capabilities and, consequently, a greater confidence in Cost <b>of</b> <b>Disposal</b> predictions...|$|R

40|$|Premature <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> female calves before {{reaching}} milch herd and undesirable <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> lactating cows {{are the major}} constraints in achieving larger herd size. During the early lactations, younger cows are supposed to give higher milk yield and undesirable <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> early calvers, thereby, greatly hampers profitability of a dairy farm. Knowledge of the incidence <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> along with reasons in various age groups and at various parities is essential to identify which age group or parity is more vulnerable for <b>disposal.</b> Moreover, knowledge <b>of</b> various genetic and non-genetic factors associated with <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> animals may also be helpful in developing breeding and management strategies to reduce the incidence <b>of</b> <b>disposal.</b> In most <b>of</b> the studies, {{it was found that}} major reasons <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> dairy cattle were mortality among female calves and involuntary culling among adult lactating cows. Maximum mortality in female calves was observed during earlier ages and pneumonia, gastro-enteritis and debility were major reasons of female calf mortality. Whereas, most of the adult cows left the herd, due to teat and udder and reproductive problems. Moreover, indigenous breeds were found to be more adapted to Indian tropical climatic conditions in comparison to crossbred and exotic cattle breeds...|$|R
