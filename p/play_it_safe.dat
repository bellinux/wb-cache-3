She commented: [...] "I knew the single 'Drummer Boy' was a risk. It {{was a very difficult}} record and so far removed from anything I'd done before. I get that... I take full responsibility for that, but I'm glad I did it. I'd rather make a unique record like 'Drummer Boy' and have it fail than <b>play</b> <b>it</b> <b>safe</b> and release bland, generic music that doesn't excite me." ...|$|E

Target and Wal-Mart are not selling the album, and Target is actually my biggest retailer. Best Buy only took limited [...] because they wanted to <b>play</b> <b>it</b> <b>safe.</b> It kinda sets you up to fail."

500|$|The 1950s saw Hepburn take on {{a series}} of {{professional}} challenges, and stretch herself further than at any other point in her life at an age when most other actresses began to retreat. Berg describes the decade as [...] "the heart of her vast legacy" [...] and [...] "the period in which she truly came into her own." [...] In January 1950, Hepburn ventured into Shakespeare, playing Rosalind in As You Like It. She hoped to prove that she could play already established material, and said, [...] "It's better to try something difficult and flop than to <b>play</b> <b>it</b> <b>safe</b> all the time." [...] It opened at the Cort Theatre in New York to a capacity audience, and was virtually sold out for 148 shows. The production then went on tour. Reviews for Hepburn varied, but she was noted as the only leading-lady in Hollywood who was performing high-caliber material onstage.|$|E

A reviewer from Billboard magazine felt that the band's [...] "personal transition from teen-dom to womanhood" [...] was most evident on [...] "Girl" [...] among other songs.

Vibes writer Dimitri Enrlich concluded, [...] "Destiny's Child refuses to <b>play</b> <b>it</b> <b>safe</b> with cookie-cutter formulas" [...] something he found evident on [...] "Girl". The Observer reviewer Kitty Empire noted that the band's characteristic female solidarity, [...] "is limply expressed in 'Girl', on which they purport to be your best friend". While reviewing #1's, Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine described the song as [...] "lovely". Jess Harvell writing for Pitchfork Media opined, [...] "'Girl' was a stroll over a 9th Wonder-produced Dramatics sample through bros-before-hoes territory as latte frothy as its 'Sex & the City' video." [...] Idolator's Mike Wass gave a more mixed review for [...] "Girl" [...] describing it as [...] "slightly sappy".|$|E

2500|$|In pre-release coverage, Infinites {{departure}} {{from some of}} the series' long-standing gameplay mechanics, namely three-on-three battles and character assist moves, for the sake of accessibility was met with mixed reception. Suriel Vazquez of Game Informer and Wesley Yin-Poole of Eurogamer stated that Infinite could end up being a divisive game, especially to the hardcore audience, since both mechanics had defined the Marvel vs. Capcom series for nearly two decades. The issue was mirrored by IGN's Daniel Krupa, who mentioned that the shifts in the series' formula could lead to a feeling among fans that their game was being [...] "diluted" [...] for newer players. Vazquez and Krupa, however, appreciated the changes, with Vazquez saying that he preferred the series [...] "go for broke", rather than <b>play</b> <b>it</b> <b>safe.</b> GamesRadar's David Houghton and Kotakus Ian Walker gave positive remarks in their impressions of the press preview build, with both praising the development team's attempt to create an accessible environment for newcomers while also pleasing the competitive community.|$|E
2500|$|The soundtrack {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, with many calling it [...] "safe" [...] and a disappointment. Joginder Tuteja gave {{a rating of}} three out of five, terming it a mixed bag and wrote [...] "There isn't anything which comes across as memorable enough to be played a few months down the line, leave aside a few years. Eventually {{what you get is}} a soundtrack that would go along with the narrative and acts as a good situational ingredient but that's about it." [...] Koimoi also gave three out of five writing that album fall short of expectations. Planet Bollywood gave 5.5 out of 10, feeling [...] "Hai Ye Maaya" [...] was the only song worth listening, and wrote [...] " [...] Don 2 doesn't quite live up to expectations which were sky high after the huge success of the first film- it's a soundtrack that will only work alongside the movie and will take the story forward, but as an audio alone it just doesn't deliver. S-E-L <b>play</b> <b>it</b> <b>safe</b> by continuing on from where they left in the previous venture and there is hardly any innovation." [...] Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the album a rating of two out of five calling it [...] "safe and self-conscious" [...] and wrote [...] "Don 2's music could fare much better if the composers Shankar-Ehsaan-and Loy had tried {{to step out of the}} prequel's shadow." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chad Childers of Loudwire {{stated that}} [...] "the album {{as a whole}} {{continues}} to expand their world-view writing like what listeners got with A Thousand Suns, but it also adds more of the anger that was prevalent in their earliest work, Hybrid Theory." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic declared that [...] "there is definition to their structure, some of the choruses catch hold without too much effort -- but this album remains one of sustained mood, not individual moments" [...] and concludes that the album is [...] "a fitting soundtrack for aging rap-rockers who are comfortable in their skin but restless at heart". The Guardian writer Dave Simpson observed that [...] "Living Things is more personal than A Thousand Suns, with underlying themes of recovery from traumatic experiences. The exception, Burn It Down, delivers an antiwar sentiment via Depeche Mode-y electro-bounce, while the similarly standout Roads Untraveled is an eerie confessional ballad", and concluded that [...] "Living Things would have benefited from more of such adventure, but they still sound like a band enjoying an unexpected second life". Johan Wippsson of Melodic wrote that the album is [...] "too little too pop-oriented and made for the charts than before. The synthesizers are a bit too intent to Coldplay mode, but assume that the band felt {{it was time to}} conquer the charts again." [...] PopMatters' Jordan Blum concluded that “Living Things is a very good entry that’s simply not as special as its precursor."

2500|$|During bidding, a team may declare either Big Mo or Little Mo, {{meaning they}} intend {{to take the first}} several tricks. [...] This is the only time that {{cross-talk}} during the bidding is allowed. [...] A player considering a Mo may ask his teammate [...] "How many do you have on the Mo?" [...] or some similar question to determine how many tricks the teammate can contribute to the Mo without revealing any details as to which tricks they'll take. [...] The only detail that can be discussed is which teammate will be leading the first trick but not how they will be leading. [...] If a team declares Little Mo, they must take the first 7 tricks of the hand. [...] Accomplishing the Little Mo earns the team 150 points. [...] If a team declares Big Mo, they must take the first 10 tricks of the hand. [...] Accomplishing the Big Mo earns the team 250 points. [...] Taking more consecutive tricks than needed does not earn the team more points. [...] For instance, taking the first 10 tricks when a Little Mo had been declared still only earns the team 150 points. [...] The team that declares either Mo is immune to bags for that hand and will lead the first trick, regardless of whose turn it was to lead. [...] Failure to accomplish the declared Mo (the opposing team took a trick before the goal was met) will cause the team to lose the points they would have earned had they been successful. [...] This is true regardless of how many tricks they took before or after the opposing team took a trick. [...] The other team bids and must match their bid, as usual.
