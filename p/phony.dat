5|$|On 1 September 1939, the {{invasion}} of Poland by Nazi Germany began. Consequently, Britain and France, obligated by the Anglo-Polish military alliance and Franco-Polish alliance to attack Germany {{in the case of}} such an invasion, demanded that Germany withdraw. On 3 September 1939, after Germany failed to comply, Britain, France, and most countries of the British Empire declared war on Germany, but provided little military support to Poland. They took minimal military action during {{what became known as the}} <b>Phony</b> War.|$|E

At the time, the cannon was not at its normal location outside Fleming House, where it is normally locked to the ground, due to ongoing renovations. The identity of the perpetrators was initially unknown, and there was speculation {{that it had been}} stolen by nearby Harvey Mudd College, who had been responsible for a well-known theft of the cannon almost twenty years prior.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Phonies</b> are a Finnish {{rock band}} formed in Ykspihlaja, Kokkola in 2002. The band's members are vocalist Tom Stenman, guitarist Risto Lehtomaa, and bassist Pekka Hietalahti. The <b>Phonies</b> is coupled around the songwriting {{partnership}} of Tom Stenman and Risto Lehtomaa, {{who have been}} working together since the late 1980s. In addition to The <b>Phonies,</b> Stenman and Lehtomaa are known from the late Finnish guitar pop band called The Refreshments, which released a few singles and one album during the 1990s. Indie critics highly acclaimed The Refreshments attracted international attention and they made mini tour with UK indie band Mega City Four. The Refreshments broke up during the recording sessions of their second album. After a few years of musical separation this characteristic songwriter duo reunited in the form of The <b>Phonies.</b> The band developed a more organic musical style as they drifted away from the sound of power pop, helping to develop the characteristic rock sound which drew its strength from the 70's psychedelia and musical influences such as The Bevis Frond, Roky Erickson and Kevin Ayers. Stenman's lyrics are known for being whimsical and somewhat cryptic. Stenman's soul-searching and intense vocals combined to Lehtomaa's sense of the style and melody forms the core of The <b>Phonies</b> music.|$|R

5|$|Following the pagoda raids, the United States {{terminated}} {{funding to}} Tung's men {{because they were}} used as a political tool rather than against the communists. Along with Diệm and Nhu, Tung was assassinated during the November 1963 coup. Nhu and Tung had been preparing a fake coup and counter-coup {{in order to give}} a false demonstration of the regime's strength. However, the pair were unaware that General Tôn Thất Đính, who was planning the <b>phony</b> operation, was involved in the real coup plot. Đính tricked Tung into sending his men into the countryside, leaving the regime in Saigon without the protection of the special forces. This led to the easy overthrow of the regime.|$|E
5|$|Sterling {{agrees to}} this, {{which results in}} a hectic car chase that frightens Sterling some, despite Burt's expert driving {{that allows him to}} achieve many Hollywood driving stunts. During this, Burt tells Sterling that he needs to stop {{thinking}} of Malory as just his mother and rather think of her as a person with emotional (and sexual) needs and that he should think about her happiness and not his. This seems to sway Sterling and at that point, Burt has been able to catch up to the ISIS agents and the Cubans and saves the ISIS agents. The then group drives back to a heartbroken Malory. Sterling apologizes for writing the <b>phony</b> letter and Burt takes Malory on their date to the movie premiere.|$|E

The cabinet was brought down by the cession of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union (effects of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact), as well as by Carol's attempt to appease German hostility by dissolving it, replacing Tătărescu with Ion Gigurtu, and recreating the Front as the totalitarian Party of the Nation.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Wallace was {{drawn into the}} debate over {{mandatory}} smallpox vaccination. Wallace originally saw the issue {{as a matter of}} personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human immune system to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely <b>phony,</b> statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.|$|E
5|$|Aiyer sent Ramanujan, {{with letters}} of introduction, to his {{mathematician}} friends in Madras. Some {{of them looked}} at his work and gave him letters of introduction to R. Ramachandra Rao, the district collector for Nellore {{and the secretary of}} the Indian Mathematical Society. Rao was impressed by Ramanujan's research but doubted that it was his own work. Ramanujan mentioned a correspondence he had with Professor Saldhana, a notable Bombay mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed a lack of understanding of his work but concluded that he was not a <b>phony.</b> Ramanujan's friend C. V. Rajagopalachari tried to quell Rao's doubts about Ramanujan's academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and listened as Ramanujan discussed elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, and his theory of divergent series, which Rao said ultimately converted him to a belief in Ramanujan's brilliance. When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan replied that he needed work and financial support. Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his research, with Rao's financial aid taking care of his daily needs. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.|$|E

Lacey travels to Hollywood, to the home of a film director (played by Ulli Lommel himself), where she brings along the last surviving haunted mirror shard {{from the end of the}} first movie as proof to her horrifying experiences.
