40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis are {{concepts}} to increase the stabilized efficiency of amorphous silicon solar cells. The work focuses on the p/i-interface region and on the intrinsic absorber layer of p-i-n type solar cells. The increased degradation of solar cells containing buffer layers in the p/i-interface region is explained by a reduction of the built-in electric field in {{the volume of the}} i-layer. A new design of the p/i interface region increases the open-circuit voltage without leading to an increased degradation of the fill factor. Intrinsic layers deposited at low substrate temperatures with a high hydrogen dilution of the silane process gas decrease the degradation of fill factor and open-circuit voltage. Very high hydrogen dilution even leads to an increase of the open-circuit voltage during light soaking. An accompanying materials study shows a correlation between the improved solar cell characteristics and good structural andtransport properties of the new i-material. A simple model is presented to explain the observed effects related to the open-circuit voltage, which is based on an analytical description of the dark I-V curves. The application of the successful results for single-junction cells into tandem cells led to the preparation of an a-Si:H/a-Si:H stacked cell with 9. 2 % stabilized efficiency after less than 10 % relative degradation. The developed processes are presently being transferred into the pilot production line of the <b>Phototronics</b> Solartechnik GmbH, Putzbrunn. (orig.) 178 refs.

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of limited nonrenewable energy {{resources}} and the limited capacity of the ecosystem for greenhouse gases and nuclear waste, sustainability is one important target in the future. Different energy scenarios showed the huge potential for photovoltaics (PV) to solve this energy problem. Nevertheless, in the last decade, PV had an average growth rate of over 20 % per year. In 2002, the solar industry delivered more than 500 MWp/year of photovoltaic generators [A. Jäger-Waldau, A European Roadmap for PV R&D, E-MRS Spring Meeting, (2003) ]. More than 85 % of the current production involves crystalline silicon technologies. These technologies still have a high cost reduction potential, but this will be limited by the silicon feedstock. On the other hand the so-called second generation thin film solar cells based on a-Si, Cu(In,Ga) (Se,S) 2 (CIGS) or CdTe have material thicknesses of a few microns {{as a result of}} their direct band gap. Also, the possibility of circuit integration offers an additional cost reduction potential. Especially in Germany, there are a few companies who focus on thin film solar cells. Today, there are two manufacturers with production lines: the <b>Phototronics</b> (PST) division of RWE-Schott Solar with a-Si thin film technology and the former Antec Solar GmbH (now Antec Solar Energy GmbH) featuring the CdTe technology. A pilot line based on CIGS technology is run by Würth Solar GmbH. There is also a variety of research activity at other companies, namely, at Shell Solar, Sulfurcell Solartechnik GmbH, Solarion GmbH and the CIS-Solartechnik GmbH. We will give an overview on research activity on various thin film technologies, as well as different manufacturing and production processes in the companies mentioned above...|$|E
40|$|Lithography {{in thick}} resist layers offers the {{possibility}} to realize functional surfaces with the precision known from microelectronic processes. The digital lithography used in microelectronics generate height profiles in the resist which is either removed completely or stays in it initial height. Other heigth levels could be not adjusted with this process. The opportunity is given by the grayton-lithography process. Using this process it is possible make nearly continues resist profiles with one single exposure using a raster screened Chromium Quartz mask. The fabrication of such a graytone mask based on a precise definition of the 3 -D topography {{which is to be}} realized. The topography definition is done by H = f(x,y). The used widefield stepper offers a maximum stepfield size of 32 mm x 40 mm on the wafer, which can be used for individual 3 D designs. The graytone masken design is performed by using the self-developed software tool GRADED. The raster screened Chromium Quartz mask is fabricated in a commercial maskenshop (e. g. <b>Phototronics</b> MZD in Dresden). The exposed and developed resist structure is evaporated with 100 nm Nickel finaly. These are the results of the project: - The graytone lithography process was optimized for fabricating micro optical devices. - A surface quality for application in the visible light region could be reached. - The precision of a specific shape could be optimized by parameter variation. - The mastering of tools for injection molding is offered as a service {{since the end of the}} project.

40|$|Within {{the present}} project {{it has been}} shown that {{improved}} a-Ge:H can also be prepared by anodic PCVD. The discrepancies regarding this, which exists in the literature, have been solved: Besides a high dilution of the germane gas with hydrogen (ratio 1 : 50), it is very important to decrease the total pressure of the discharge down to low pressures around 15 Pa. As a consequence, the cathode self bias increases to 300 V. Energetic particles reflected at the cathode (especially atomic hydrogen) reach a mean free path corresponding to the interelectrode spacing of 3. 5 cm. This results in an increased energetic bombardment of the growing film. Keeping this effect in mind it becomes possible to avoid the cathodic PCVD of a-Ge:H, which is difficult to realize in commercial reactors. Solar cells prepared with the improved a-Ge:H did not exhibit a significant efficiency. This casts doubt on the in-principal suitability of this thin film material for an active layer in thin film solar cells. The structural properties of film prepared under 'soft' conditions (pressure around 150 Pa, cathode bias around 70 V) can be improved by the addition of tetrafluormethane gas to the discharge. This is a hint about the positive role of etching processes acting simultaneously to the deposition process. Adding tetrafluormethane to the process at 'hard' deposition conditions results in an increased incorporation of carbon into the amorphous germanium and a reduction of the electronic quality of the films. The deposition of silicon onto ultrathin (above 8 nm) underlayers of aluminum initiates the growth of crystalline silicon. The deposition rate and temperature during silicon deposition were of 0. 5 #mu#m/h and 500 K, which equals those for the deposition of a-Si:H. The effect of Al-mediated crystallite growth has been observed for sputter-deposition as well as for PCVD. The effect is related to the diffusion of Al-crystallites into the growing film. It is highly influenced by the energy flux during deposition. (orig.)
