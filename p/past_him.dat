5|$|Cement {{was placed}} at the hairpin around Kubica's accident. Räikkönen ran wide after he misjudged the braking on the dust. The Super Aguri of Takuma Sato went <b>past</b> <b>him</b> as a result and moved into 10th place.|$|E

5|$|Diagon Alley's {{flagship}} {{attraction is}} Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts, 3-D motion-based steel roller coaster dark ride based around Gringotts Bank, the wizarding bank in Diagon Alley. Riders enter the bank into the queue area where Bogrod greets visitors and instructs {{them to continue}} <b>past</b> <b>him</b> to travel deep into the vaults of the bank to open an account. Unlike Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, this ride is hosted by Bill Weasley, played by Domhnall Gleeson, reprising his role from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Part 2.|$|E
5|$|Mohorič {{was passed}} by Alexey Tsatevich (Katusha) and Primož Roglič (LottoNL–Jumbo), {{who went on to}} contest a two-man sprint. Tsatevich won the sprint, despite an early celebration that nearly allowed Roglič to come <b>past</b> <b>him.</b> The peloton {{finished}} together, 14 seconds behind, with Jarlinson Pantano (IAM) winning the sprint for third place. Quintana therefore sealed his overall victory, with Contador second and Martin third.|$|E

5|$|The fourth- and second-to-last {{riders to}} leave the starthouse, Levi Leipheimer and Denis Menchov, put up the best rides of the day, with Menchov between 30 seconds and a minute better than Leipheimer at the three {{intermediate}} time checks, and 20 seconds better at the line for the stage win. Menchov's ride propelled him into the pink jersey, while Leipheimer narrowly missed taking enough time out of Di Luca to move <b>past</b> <b>him</b> in the general classification. Di Luca finished sixth on the stage.|$|E
5|$|Agonistic {{behaviour}} typically {{consists of}} squabbles between individuals climbing over or passing each other. This occasionally involves biting. Males that are strangers may wrestle, chase, and bite each other. In extreme situations, a male {{may try to}} displace a smaller rival from a tree. This involves the larger aggressor climbing up and attempting to corner the victim, which tries either to rush <b>past</b> <b>him</b> and climb down or {{to move to the}} end of a branch. The aggressor attacks by grasping the target by the shoulders and repeatedly biting him. Once the weaker individual is driven away, the victor bellows and marks the tree. Pregnant and lactating females are particularly aggressive and attack individuals that come too close. In general, however, koalas tend to avoid energy-wasting aggressive behaviour.|$|E
5|$|At 10:45am on 12 June Private Haines, a sentry on {{the left}} hand flank, warned of the {{approach}} of an Indonesian foot patrol along the river bank. The Australians had sited the ambush to engage targets on the river and were initially at a disadvantage. Ten minutes after the Indonesians were first seen, Private Sneddon, on the extreme left, engaged a group of six Indonesians with a long burst of machine-gun fire, killing two instantly and a third as he ran towards him. Haines subsequently killed a fourth, while a fifth Indonesian continued <b>past</b> <b>him,</b> followed by five others, who then engaged the Australians. The Indonesian patrol continued to advance, taking them towards {{the rear of the}} Australian positions.|$|E

5|$|At {{the foot}} of the climb, the leading group only had a small {{advantage}} over the peloton and were soon caught. There were no lead-out trains in the final kilometres, with fewer than 60 riders left in the group. Tosh Van der Sande (Lotto-Soudal) was the first to sprint, but Kristian Sbaragli (MTN-Qhubeka) came <b>past</b> <b>him</b> and took the stage victory. Degenkolb was the quickest in the final metres, but he had been badly positioned and was only able to finish second. José Joaquín Rojas (Movistar) finished third. The stage was Sbaragli's first win in over two years. It was the second win of his career and the first in a Grand Tour.|$|E
5|$|Kyle Busch {{moved up}} to fourth after passing Allmendinger on lap 54. After 55 laps, Stewart had {{moved up to}} eighth while Johnson had moved up to 12th. Three laps later, the second caution was given, after Keselowski {{developed}} a flat tire and crashed into the wall. All the front-runners made pit stops during the caution, with most asking for tires and adjustments. At the lap 65 restart, Edwards remained the leader before Hamlin moved <b>past</b> <b>him</b> on the following lap. On the 67th lap, Kurt Busch passed Edwards, moving him down to third. During lap 69, Kenseth passed Busch to move to fifth. Two laps later, Johnson was scored ninth, while Harvick was 12th. Afterward, Kyle Busch fell to the eighth position by the 73rd lap. Stewart moved up to the eighth position three laps later while Hamlin had a lead of 1.3seconds.|$|E
5|$|On either 10 or 11 June 323BC, Alexander died in {{the palace}} of Nebuchadnezzar II, in Babylon, at age 32. There are two {{different}} versions of Alexander's death and details of the death differ slightly in each. Plutarch's account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus, and spent the night and next day drinking with Medius of Larissa. He developed a fever, which worsened until {{he was unable to}} speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file <b>past</b> <b>him</b> as he silently waved at them. In the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles, followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever and died after some agony. Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim.|$|E

5|$|The {{use of a}} wing-forward was a {{distinctive}} feature of New Zealand play. Instead of having eight men in the scrum as was normal elsewhere, seven men were usedthe missing man, the wing-forward, instead fed {{the ball into the}} scrum then held onto one of their hookers while the ball progressed through the scrum to their half-back. With the wing-forward bound {{to the side of the}} scrum, the opposing half-back would then have to manoeuvre <b>past</b> <b>him</b> to tackle the player with the ball. This increased the amount of time the half-back would have in possession of the ball before his opposite could tackle him.|$|E
5|$|As soon as Gibraltar was captured, the Alliance {{set about}} {{preparing}} for a Bourbon counter-attack. The Alliance fleet sailed a short distance across the strait to Tetuan in Morocco, where it took on fresh water. On 22 August, a French fleet was sighted in the strait but began to withdraw after being spotted. Rooke {{caught up with the}} French off Málaga on 24 August and attacked, in a bid to prevent the French from slipping <b>past</b> <b>him</b> and attacking Gibraltar. The two fleets were evenly matched but the French ships were faster and had more ammunition than the confederates. They did not manage to make this advantage count, however, and the Battle of Vélez-Málaga was effectively fought to a draw. No ships were sunk but both fleets took very heavy casualties with around 3,000 killed or wounded on each side, including the French commander. The Anglo-Dutch fleet was hampered by a shortage of shot and gunpowder, much of which had already been used in bombarding Gibraltar during the operation to capture it, and Sir George Byng's squadron was forced to pull back when it ran out of ammunition. The rest of the fleet was dangerously low on ammunition but fortunately for the confederates, the French withdrew the following day, leaving the Anglo-Dutch fleet to limp back to Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|At the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, Nurmi {{competed in}} three events. He won the 10,000 m by staying right behind Ritola until sprinting <b>past</b> <b>him</b> {{on the home}} straight. Before the 5000 m final, Nurmi injured himself in his {{qualifying}} heat for the 3000 m steeplechase. He fell on his back at the water jump, spraining his hip and foot. Lucien Duquesne stopped to help him up, and Nurmi thanked the Frenchman by pacing him past the field and offered him the heat win, which Duquesne gracefully refused. In the 5000 m, Nurmi tried to repeat his move on Ritola but had to watch his teammate pull away instead. Nurmi, looking more exhausted than ever before, only barely managed to keep Wide behind and take silver. Nurmi had little time to rest or nurse his injuries as the 3000 m steeplechase started the next day. Struggling with the hurdles, Nurmi let Finland's steeplechase specialist Toivo Loukola escape into the distance. On the final lap, he sprinted clear of the others and finished nine seconds behind the world-record setting Loukola; Nurmi's time also bettered the previous record. Although Ritola did not finish, Ove Andersen completed a Finnish sweep of the medals.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the lights}} went on for the start, Pascal Wehrlein {{came to a halt}} in the wrong grid slot, having mistakenly taken the spot left vacant by Massa, who was {{starting}} from the pitlane. Wehrlein was able to reverse into his slot one row behind just 0.5 seconds before the start light procedure started, avoiding a penalty. At the start, Hamilton got away well from pole position while Hülkenberg lost ground. Button was second as Rosberg moved ahead of Ricciardo and Verstappen. Having gotten a new car built overnight, Daniil Kvyat retired at the end of lap two, after having started from the pitlane. On lap six, Rosberg got ahead of Hülkenberg in fourth position, while Verstappen took advantage and overtook Hülkenberg as well. Räikkönen got ahead of Button into second on lap seven. Tyre stops started on lap nine, as Hülkenberg and Alonso were the first to come in, followed by Button one lap later. After Gutiérrez came <b>past</b> <b>him</b> into ninth on lap 12, Massa headed for the pitlane as well. As Wehrlein made a pit stop on lap 14, Hamilton was still in the lead, followed by Räikkönen and Rosberg.|$|E
5|$|In reply, Australia were {{in trouble}} at 7/208 when Johnston came to the crease to join Lindwall, with five more runs needed to avoid the follow on. As Sid Barnes was unable to bat due to injury, Australia were {{effectively}} eight wickets down. Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow-on before Bedser removed both. Johnston was reprieved in his brief innings when he edged a delivery from Dick Pollard {{in the direction of}} Edrich at first slip, but Evans dived across, trying to catch the ball at full stretch in his right hand. The wicket-keeper could not hold onto the ball, and the resulting deflection further to the right wrong-footed Edrich, who was moving the other way, and it went <b>past</b> <b>him.</b> From second slip, Jack Crapp dived left behind Edrich but the ball landed a few centimetres beyond his fingers. However, in the next over Bedser, Johnston edged the ball in the same manner and Crapp caught the ball easily. Johnston was out for three as Australia ended with 221 to narrowly avoid the follow on by eight runs. He was wicketless in the second innings, taking 0/34 as England declared at 3/174 and set Australia 317 for victory on the last day after the fourth day was completely washed out by rain. The match ended in a draw with Australia at 1/92, after many rain interruptions.|$|E
5|$|On lap 46, Vettel {{went past}} Hülkenberg for eighth {{at the final}} chicane. There was no contact between the two drivers, but the Force India car spun {{in order to avoid}} the wall on the outside of the final corner. Two laps later, Fernando Alonso was the first driver to retire from the race, his third {{consecutive}} retirement. On lap 52, Romain Grosjean tried to lap Will Stevens, cutting his rear left tyre in the process. The incident also brought him a five-second time penalty. The other Lotus of Pastor Maldonado also lost a position when Vettel moved <b>past</b> <b>him</b> for fifth on lap 56. Jenson Button joined his teammate in retirement two laps later, being called into the pit lane by his team. Felipe Massa went up into sixth overtaking Maldonado on lap 64. For the remaining laps, Hamilton managed to control the lead and went on to win in Montreal for the fourth time, finishing 2.2 seconds ahead of Rosberg, with Bottas in third a further 38 seconds behind.|$|E
