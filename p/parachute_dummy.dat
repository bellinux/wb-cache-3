2500|$|After Reichelt's death, the {{authorities}} were wary of granting permission for experiments from the Eiffel Tower. Though {{they continued to}} grant permissions for <b>parachute</b> <b>dummy</b> drops, some hopeful inventors – such as M. Damblanc, who wished to try his [...] "helicopter parachute" [...] from the second platform – were refused permission to conduct tests, and even applications for aviation experiments not involving the tower came under renewed scrutiny. More recently, the tower has been {{the scene of a}} number of illicit base jumps. A Norwegian man died in 2005 after losing his canopy while attempting a promotional jump for a clothing firm – the first parachuting death at the tower since Reichelt. A sanctioned stunt jump for the 1985 James Bond film A View to a Kill was successful.|$|E

5000|$|Most of the pathfinders {{missed their}} drop zones. The 517th team dropped early at 0328. North of La Ciotat the aircrews dropped 300 <b>parachute</b> <b>dummies</b> {{and a large}} {{quantity}} of [...] "rifle simulators" [...] which went off in firecracker-like explosions as they hit the ground.|$|R
50|$|Improvising small structures, such as <b>parachutes,</b> statues or <b>dummies,</b> {{baseball}} bats, full-size operational gliders, trampolines, gloves (for {{fighting the}} likes of Electro), nets, water-tight domes (for underwater breathing), bandages, slings, bulletproof shields, plugs, patches, and even hammocks.|$|R
50|$|Operation High Dive (also {{known as}} Project High Dive) {{was a secret}} project carried out during the 1950s by the United States Air Force. It tested high-altitude <b>parachutes</b> using {{anthropomorphic}} <b>dummies.</b> The dummies went into a 200 rpm flat spin, which would be fatal to a human. Further investigations on this led to Project Excelsior. It may later have been confused with Project Mogul and thus helped form {{the account of the}} Roswell UFO Incident.|$|R
25|$|U.S. {{aircraft}} constantly made reconnaissance and bombing flights over southern Luzon, {{intending to}} deceive the Japanese forces {{into believing that}} the attack on Luzon would come from the south. In addition, transport aircraft were used to make <b>parachute</b> drops with <b>dummies.</b> Minesweepers were used to clear the bays of Balayan, Batangas, and Tayabas, located {{to the south of}} Luzon, and Filipino resistance fighters conducted sabotage operations in southern Luzon. These deception operations failed to convince General Yamashita, the leader of the Imperial Japanese Army in the Philippines, and he built significant defensive positions in the hills and mountains surrounding the Lingayen Gulf in Northern Luzon.|$|R
500|$|Born in Sydney on 9 October 1918, Read {{was the son}} of an {{immigrant}} from Bristol, England. He was educated at Sydney Grammar School, where he completed his Leaving Certificate. After working as a clerk in a motoring firm, Read joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as an air cadet on 21July 1937. He underwent instruction at No. 1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, and gained his commission as a pilot officer in June 1938. Over the next two years he flew with No.3 Squadron and No.22 Squadron, which were based at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, and operated Hawker Demon biplanes. He was involved in experimental <b>parachute</b> drops with <b>dummies</b> near Menangle; on one such test a fundamental flaw in the harness revealed itself when the dummy slipped clean from the chute, necessitating a redesign. By the time Australia declared war on 3September 1939, Read had been promoted to flying officer. He later recalled a flurry of activity on the day, but with little real purpose: [...] "After all, we were pretty remote from Europe".|$|R
