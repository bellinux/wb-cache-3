5|$|CSF can {{be tested}} for the {{diagnosis}} {{of a variety of}} neurological diseases, usually obtained by a procedure called lumbar <b>puncture.</b> Lumbar <b>puncture</b> is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting a needle into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. CSF is extracted through the needle, and tested. About one third of people experience a headache after lumbar <b>puncture,</b> and pain or discomfort at the needle entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising, meningitis or ongoing post lumbar-puncture leakage of CSF.|$|E
5|$|Gignac {{and colleagues}} also noted, however, that bone <b>puncture</b> marks from Deinonychus are {{relatively}} rare, and unlike larger theropods with many known <b>puncture</b> marks like Tyrannosaurus, Deinonychus {{probably did not}} frequently bite through or eat bone. Instead, they probably used their high bite force in defense or prey capture, rather than feeding.|$|E
5|$|Lumbar <b>puncture</b> {{can also}} be {{performed}} to measure the intracranial pressure, which might be increased in certain types of hydrocephalus. However, a lumbar <b>puncture</b> should never be performed if increased intracranial pressure is suspected due to certain situations such as a tumour, because {{it can lead to}} fatal brain herniation.|$|E

5|$|CSF pressure, as {{measured}} by lumbar <b>puncture,</b> is 10–18 cmH2O (8–15 mmHg or 1.1–2 kPa) with the patient lying {{on the side and}} 20–30 cmH2O (16–24 mmHg or 2.1–3.2 kPa) with the patient sitting up. In newborns, CSF pressure ranges from 8 to 10 cmH2O (4.4–7.3mmHg or 0.78–0.98kPa). Most variations are due to coughing or internal compression of jugular veins in the neck. When lying down, the CSF pressure as estimated by lumbar <b>puncture</b> is similar to the intracranial pressure.|$|E

Subsequent CT scans of Jane's skull would further confirm the team's hypothesis, showing that the <b>puncture</b> wounds came from a traumatic injury and that there was subsequent healing.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we design {{non-uniform}} bit-wise <b>puncturing</b> distributions for irregular non-binary LDPC (NB-LDPC) codes. The <b>puncturing</b> distributions are optimized by minimizing the decoding {{threshold of the}} <b>punctured</b> LDPC code, the threshold being computed with a Monte-Carlo implementation of Density Evolution. First, we show that Density Evolution computed with Monte-Carlo simulations provides accurate (very close) and precise (small variance) estimates of NB-LDPC code ensemble thresholds. Based on the proposed method, we analyze several <b>puncturing</b> distributions for regular and semi-regular codes, obtained either by clustering <b>punctured</b> bits, or spreading them over the symbol-nodes of the Tanner graph. Finally, optimized <b>puncturing</b> distributions for non-binary LDPC codes with small maximum degree are presented, which exhibit a gap between 0. 2 and 0. 5 dB to the channel capacity, for <b>punctured</b> rates varying from 0. 5 to 0. 9.

40|$|Abstract — We {{analyze the}} {{asymptotic}} performance of <b>punctured</b> turbo codes. The analysis {{is based on}} the union bound on the word error probability of maximum likelihood decoding for a <b>punctured</b> turbo code ensembles averaged over all possible <b>puncturing</b> patterns and interleavers. By using special probabilistic <b>puncturing,</b> we prove that, for a given mother turbo code ensemble [C] with a finite noise threshold c [C] 0, if the asymptotic <b>puncturing</b> rate λ satisfies log λ < −c [C] 0, there exists a finite noise threshold c [CP] 0 for the <b>punctured</b> turbo code ensemble which is bounded by a function of c [C] 0 and λ. Based on this result, we prove that, on any binary-input memoryless channel whose Bhattacharyya noise distance is greater than c [CP] 0, the average ML decoding word error probability of the <b>punctured</b> turbo code ensemble approaches zero at least as fast as n −β, where β is the well known “interleaver gain ” exponent.
