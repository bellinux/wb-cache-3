5|$|A {{closely related}} problem, the minimax path problem, asks for the <b>path</b> <b>that</b> {{minimizes}} the maximum weight {{of any of}} its edges. It has applications that include transportation planning. Any algorithm for the widest path problem can be transformed into an algorithm for the minimax path problem, or vice versa, by reversing the sense of all the weight comparisons performed by the algorithm, or equivalently by replacing every edge weight by its negation.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} and studies {{the performance of}} two offline and four online heuristics: i) Offline Most Overlapped (Offline-MO) [27], a technique that aims to use <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> share the most links with past or/and future LSP requests, ii) Offline with Ratio (Offline-R), {{which is similar to}} Offline-MO but favors <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> require fewer number of new links, iii) Online Most Overlapped (Online-MO), which is similar to its offline counterpart, is an algorithm <b>that</b> uses <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> share the most links with already established links, iv) Online with Ratio (Online-R), which is similar to Online-MO but prefers <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> involve the minimal number of new links, v) Online Minimum Hops (Online-MinH) [28], an approach that gives priority to paths with a small number of hops, and vi) Online Random LSP (Online-R-LSP) [29] which selects paths randomly.|$|R

5|$|Dead reckoning, {{in animals}} usually known as path integration, means the putting {{together}} of cues from different sensory sources within the body, {{without reference to}} visual or other external landmarks, to estimate position relative to a known starting point continuously while travelling on a <b>path</b> <b>that</b> is not necessarily straight. Seen as a problem in geometry, the task is to compute the vector to a starting point by adding the vectors for each leg of the journey from that point.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Joan's {{path through}} the {{southern}} Caribbean in late October was highly unusual. Most October storms in the Atlantic gravitate towards the northern portion of the Caribbean, and often recurve quickly. Joan took the southernmost path of a tropical cyclone since a June system in 1933, although Hurricane Irene in 1971 took a <b>path</b> <b>that</b> was just north of Joan's. Joan-Miriam was also unusual in that it survived passage from the Atlantic to Pacific Ocean. Only seven other storms {{have been known to}} survive the passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.|$|E
5|$|In 1735, Euler {{presented}} {{a solution to}} the problem known as the Seven Bridges of Königsberg. The city of Königsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a <b>path</b> <b>that</b> crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no Eulerian circuit. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory, specifically of planar graph theory.|$|E

The precise motives for Tiberius's withdrawal are unclear. Historians have speculated a connection with the fact that Augustus had adopted Julia's sons by Agrippa Gaius and Lucius, and seemed to be moving them along the same political <b>path</b> <b>that</b> both Tiberius and Drusus had trodden.|$|E
5|$|Iridion 3D is a quasi-3D rail shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by Shin'en. A launch {{title for the}} Game Boy Advance portable game console, it was released in North America on May 29, 2001 and in Europe on September 21 the same year. Influenced by the Commodore 64 game Uridium, the game features a single starship fighting the alien Iridion, who have attacked Earth. Iridion spans seven levels from Earth to the aliens' home planet, each with a fixed linear <b>path</b> <b>that</b> ends with a boss.|$|E
5|$|Micro Machines is a {{top-down}} racing game: players observe races from above. Players race in environments such as {{breakfast and}} pool tables, work desks, and treehouses, driving toy vehicles such as powerboats, helicopters, formula one cars, and tanks that can shoot other racers. Courses have a predefined <b>path</b> <b>that</b> racers must follow: {{if a player}} leaves the defined route for too long they are {{sent back to the}} track. Many have obstacles such as cereal boxes on breakfast tables, and pencil sharpeners on desks.|$|E

5|$|Several twentieth-century writers {{explored}} {{possibilities of}} wheeled creatures. L. Frank Baum's 1907 children's novel Ozma of Oz features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers. Their wheels {{are composed of}} keratin, which has been suggested by biologists {{as a means of}} avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels. Despite moving quickly on open terrain, the Wheelers are stymied by obstacles in their <b>path</b> <b>that</b> do not hinder creatures with limbs, and they cannot cross sand.|$|E

Successive inferior conjunctions of Venus repeat {{very near}} a 13:8 orbital resonance (Earth orbits 8 times for every 13 orbits of Venus), shifting 144° upon sequential inferior conjunctions. The resonance 13:8 ratio is approximate. 8/13 is approximately 0.615385 while Venus orbits the Sun in 0.615187 years.|$|E
5|$|Arhys informs Daryus that Gabriel {{will be at}} Heaven's Cove {{that night}} ("Moment of Betrayal"). While the meeting time {{approaches}} ("Heaven's Cove"), Faythe decides {{that she wants to}} use the power of her royal status to change the world for good ("Begin Again"). At the amphitheater, Arhys changes his mind on the deal, and when Daryus shows up, they start a fight. Daryus overpowers Arhys and kills him ("The <b>Path</b> <b>That</b> Divides"), unaware that Xander followed them and saw the whole scene. As Xander runs to his father's dead body, Daryus sees the silhouette of someone approaching him. Assuming it to be Gabriel, he attempts to kill him, realising too late that it is actually Faythe ("The Walking Shadow"). Gabriel arrives at the scene and sees his dead brother and the dying Faythe. Covering Xander's ears, he unleashes a scream that causes Daryus to go deaf and that is heard by Nafaryus, Arabelle, and the entire town ("My Last Farewell").|$|E

5|$|Basil II's {{first attempt}} to {{overwhelm}} the defenders of the pass was unsuccessful and his army was unable {{to pass through the}} valley, which was defended by 15,000–20,000 Bulgarians. Despite the difficulties the Byzantine Emperor did not abandon the attack. He ordered his general Nicephorus Xiphias to manoeuvre his troops around the high Belasitsa mountain and surround the Bulgarians, while he continued the assaults on the wall. Xiphias led his troops along a steep <b>path</b> <b>that</b> led him into the Bulgarians' rear. On July 29, Xiphias attacked the guards, trapping them in the valley. The Bulgarian soldiers abandoned their towers to face this new threat and Basil was able to break through the front line and destroy the wall.|$|E
5|$|Bouldering {{is a form}} of rock {{climbing}} that is performed on large boulders, small rock formations or artificial rock walls, without the use of ropes or harnesses. While it can be done without any equipment whatsoever, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry and provide a firmer grip, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls. Unlike free solo climbing, which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (the <b>path</b> <b>that</b> a climber takes in order to complete the climb) are usually less than 6 meters (20ft.) tall. Artificial climbing walls allow boulderers to train indoors in areas without natural boulders. Bouldering competitions, which employ a variety of formats, take place in both indoor and outdoor settings.|$|E
5|$|Early in the storm's development, {{forecasting}} Erika's {{motion was}} difficult, with a persistent leftward bias in official forecasts. In response to Erika's threat, {{the government of}} Saint Martin first issued a tropical storm warning late on September 4. The next day, the respective governments of Antigua, Montserrat, Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, Dominica, Guadeloupe, and Saint Barthélemy issued tropical storm warnings for their islands. When Erika's motion resulted in a <b>path</b> <b>that</b> would take it closer to the islands, all of the aforementioned islands excluding Guadeloupe upgraded the tropical storm warning to a hurricane warning. In addition, a hurricane watch was issued for the British and United States Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico. In public advisories, the National Hurricane Center stated tropical storm conditions {{were likely to be}} experienced in the Azores. Early forecasts anticipated a threat to the island of Bermuda.|$|E
