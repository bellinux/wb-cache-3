5|$|The {{most common}} species are game fish, found in Lake Phelps, are largemouth bass, chain <b>pickerel,</b> catfish, yellow perch and pumpkinseed. These fish are what brought the Algonquian {{to the area}} nearly 10,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Cold water {{fishing is}} {{available}} in Black Moshannon Creek and several of its tributaries, where anglers will find rainbow and brown trout that have been stocked there for sport fishing by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Black Moshannon Lake's waters are warmer {{than those of the}} creek, and so hold many different species of fish, including largemouth bass, muskellunge, yellow perch, chain <b>pickerel,</b> bullhead catfish, northern pike, bluegill, and crappie.|$|E

50|$|The redfin {{and grass}} <b>pickerels</b> occur {{primarily}} in sluggish, vegetated waters of pools, lakes, and swamps, and are carnivorous, feeding on smaller fish. Larger fishes, {{such as the}} striped bass (Morone saxatilis), bowfin (Amia calva), and gray weakfish (Cynoscion regalis), in turn, prey on the <b>pickerels</b> when they venture into larger rivers or estuaries.|$|R
50|$|Both {{subspecies}} {{are native}} to North America. They {{are not to}} be confused with their aggressive counterpart the Northern pike. The redfin <b>pickerel's</b> range extends from the Saint Lawrence drainage in Quebec down to the Gulf Coast, from Mississippi to Florida, while the grass <b>pickerel's</b> range is further west, extending from the Great Lakes Basin, from Ontario to Michigan, down to the western Gulf Coast, from eastern Texas to Mississippi.|$|R
40|$|The work {{is aimed}} at {{studying}} the phenetic variety of the <b>pickerels</b> from the East Europe and the North Asia. For the first time, using the common diagram, including {{the description of the}} outer appearance, the evaluation of the fishes age and growth, the determination of the sex and the stages of the gonades maturation, the analysis of nutrition, the morphometry and osteologys, 25 populations of the common and 5 populations of the Amur <b>pickerels</b> have been investigated. The obtained data have been processed with the one-dimensial and multi-dimensional statistic methods. The indirected variations of the morphological indicators, conditioned by the growth of the small and large individuals in the populations, have been revealed. The results of the work can be used by the Higher Schools in the courses of ichtiology, by the organisations of the system Glavrubvod at the necessity of the differentiated approach to the evaluation of the reserves and the trade use of the local populations of the <b>pickerels</b> both species.

Animals inhabiting the areas surrounding the pools include <b>pickerel</b> frogs, green frogs, wood ducks, and snapping turtles. Plants in this location include broadleaf arrowhead, northern blueflag, manna grasses, water starwort, and several varieties of sedges. Japanese knotweed has been seen near Interstate 80 on the northern edges of the Turkey Hill Oxbow.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the chain <b>pickerel,</b> the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 and 2004, 31 {{fish species}} {{were found at}} 20 sites in the {{watershed}} of Roaring Creek. Eastern blacknose dace {{are the most common}} fish species in the watershed and were observed at 85 percent of the sites. White suckers and brown trout occurred at 80 percent of the sites, longnose dace occurred at 70 percent of the sites, cutlips minnows occurred at 65 percent of the sites, and bluegills occurred at 60 percent of the sites. Fallfish, golden shiners, yellow bullheads, and American eels were all historically observed in the watershed, but were not found during the survey. However, redside dace, creek chubsuckers, green sunfish, and fathead minnows were observed in the watershed for the first time during the 2003/2004 survey. The most common game species was wild brown trout, although smaller numbers of brook trout were observed as well.

25|$|During {{the same}} time, Bank Rock Bridge, also called Cabinet Bridge, across {{the mouth of}} the cove was recreated in carved oak with {{cast-iron}} panels and pine decking, its original materials, following Vaux's original design of 1859–60. The cascade, where the Gill empties into the lake, was reconstructed to approximate its dramatic original form, inspired by paintings of Asher B. Durand. Sections of the Lake were dredged of accumulated silt – topsoil that had washed off the surrounding slopes – and the island formerly in the lake, which gradually eroded below water level, was reconstructed in the summer of 2007 with rugged boulders along its shoreline, graded wetland areas, and submerged planting shelves for water-loving native plants, like <b>Pickerel</b> weed.|$|E
25|$|Lake Nockamixon is an {{artificial}} reservoir formed by a dam on Tohickon Creek {{and serves as}} the centerpiece of Nockamixon State Park. Swimming is not allowed in the lake, but boating is popular, and the park maintains several marinas and boat rentals. Fishing is also popular, and common species include walleye, <b>pickerel,</b> carp, and various kinds of bass and catfish. The water is clean and blue and has a very faint current, since the lake is part of the course of Tohickon Creek, which feeds in midway along the northwestern edge of the lake and discharges at the dam at the southeast corner. Lake Nockamixon is also fed by two other creeks known as Haycock Run, which feeds in at the northernmost point, and Three Mile Run, which feeds in at the southernmost point.|$|E

The lake had very few plants in it, but its shore was lined with mountain laurel and, in the east, mountain ash. After the Ganoga Lake Association's 1957 purchase, they drained the lake to kill its fish, then stocked it with [...] "30,000fingerling brook trout". In 2007 Lake Jean, which is connected to Lake Ganoga via Kitchen Creek, was still home {{to many of the}} fish found [...] there in the 19th century: brook trout, brown trout, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, chain <b>pickerel,</b> and largemouth bass.|$|E

500|$|Lake Jean {{is home to}} brook trout, brown trout, brown bullhead, {{and yellow}} bullhead. Acid rain with a pH near 3.0 has altered {{the ecology of the}} lakes and region; in Lake Jean low pH has {{decreased}} the number and quality of insects and plankton {{at the base of the}} food chain. Fish which are acid tolerant are predominant, including fathead minnows, muskellunge, pumpkinseed, walleye, and yellow perch. Predators like chain <b>pickerel</b> and largemouth bass are relatively few in number, and adult fish appear to grow rapidly but breed comparatively poorly.

500|$|By the 1960s, large {{portions}} of the park, such as Tibbetts Brook, were being polluted by human activity; in addition, the brook now flowed into the Broadway sewer {{at the south end}} of Van Cortlandt Lake. Pollution from upstream and the highways, and spillover of chemicals used in the golf course, killed fish in the lake. This problem was first noticed in May 1961 when thousands of dead bass, <b>pickerel,</b> catfish, perch, and carp floated up at the edge of the lake. The mass-death of fish was blamed on siltation, Three years later, fish were still being killed by siltation. City investigators took water samples from the lake and found that they contained large amounts of weeds and sediment. About [...] of the lake's surface area was being lost to sedimentation every year. In addition, an algal bloom that caused the lake to be in a low-oxygen condition, endangering plants and animals in and around the lake. [...] "Unpleasant odors" [...] in the summer also reduced recreational opportunities on the lake, and these conditions combined made it virtually impossible to come into contact with the lake's water without getting sick. By 1976, there was a moratorium on all boating activities on the lake.|$|E
