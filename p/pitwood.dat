50|$|Klöckner & Co {{held its}} ground through the post-World War I recession, {{compensating}} for {{losses in the}} steel business by expanding its fields of activity. Sales increased. The scrap trade boomed while other business such as trading <b>pitwood,</b> coal and chemicals generated additional revenues. In the 1920s and ’30s, the company opened its first branches in Europe, South America and North America {{and set up a}} special foreign operations department. The steel trader whose business focused chiefly on Germany had now grown into a distributor with international operations and a broad product portfolio. Dividing the company into Klöckner-Werke AG and Klöckner & Co served to further strengthen the independent nature of the distribution activities.|$|E

He authored the Hope Simpson Report in 1930, following the widespread 1929 Palestine riots. He is known for his work on the question of refugees. In 1931 he became director-general of the Chinese National Government Flood Relief Commission, where in 1934 he commented on the Japanese bombing of a flood refugee camp. Coming out of retirement at 66 years of age, Sir John became the Commissioner of Natural Resources and Acting-Commissioner of Justice for The Commission of Government of Newfoundland from 1934 until 1936. Port Hope Simpson, Newfoundland was named after him in response to the most significant backing [...] he had given to John Osborn Williams, the owner of the Labrador Development Company Limited, who set up a loggers' camp in Alexis Bay for cutting and exporting <b>pitwood</b> to Cardiff for the collieries of South Wales. Simpson also established the Newfoundland Rangers No Report Found a welfare and police force meant to link the people of Newfoundland and Labrador with The Commission of Government in St. John's.|$|E
