50|$|The first {{published}} history of predicting spacecraft equipment failures {{occurred on the}} 12 Rockwell/U.S. Air Force Global Positioning System Block I (Phase 1) satellites using non-repeatable transient events (NRTE) and GPS Kalman filter data from the GPS Master Control Station, between 1978 and 1984 by the GPS Space and Ground Segment Manager. NRTEs were isolated to the GPS satellites after mission operations support personnel replayed the real-time satellite telemetry ruling out RF and land-line noise caused from poor Eb/No or S/N and data acquisition and display system processing problems. The GPS satellite's subsystem equipment vendors diagnosed the NRTEs as systemic noise that preceded the equipment failures because at the time, {{it was believed that}} all equipment failures occurred instantaneously and randomly and so equipment failures could not be predicted (e.g. equipment failures exhibited memoryless behavior). Rockwell International GPS Systems Engineering Manager ordered a stop to predicting GPS satellite equipment failures in 1983 claiming it wasn't possible and the company was not on contract to do so. The <b>prognostic</b> <b>analysis</b> that was completed on the GPS satellite telemetry was published quarterly contractually as a CDRL to the GPS Program Office personnel and a wide variety of Air Force subcontractors working on the GPS program.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} biomass burning in simulating the seasonal signal in both prognostic and diagnostic analyses. The <b>prognostic</b> <b>analysis</b> involved the High-Resolution Biosphere Model, a prognostic terrestrial biosphere model, and the coupled vegetation fire module, which together produce a prognostic data set of biomass burning. The diagnostic analysis involved the Simple Diagnostic Biosphere Model (SDBM) and the Hao and Liu [1994] diagnostic data set of biomass burning, which have been scaled to global 2 and 4 Pg C yr(- 1), respectively. The monthly carbon exchange fields between the atmosphere and the biosphere with a spatial resolution of 0. 5 degrees x 0. 5 degrees, the seasonal atmosphere-ocean exchange fields, and the emissions from fossil fuels have been coupled to the three-dimensional atmospheric transport model TM 2. We have chosen eight monitoring stations of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration network to compare the predicted seasonal atmospheric CO 2 signals with those deduced from atmosphere-biosphere carbon exchange fluxes without any contribution from biomass burning. The <b>prognostic</b> <b>analysis</b> and the diagnostic analysis with global burning emissions of 4 Pg C yr(- 1) agree {{with respect to the}} change in the amplitude of the seasonal CO 2 concentration introduced through biomass burning. We find that the seasonal CO 2 signal at stations in higher northern latitudes (north of 30 degrees N) is marginally influenced by biomass burning. For stations in tropical regions an increase in the CO 2 amplitude of more than 1 ppmv (up to 50 % with respect to the observed trough to peak amplitude) has been calculated. Biomass burning at stations farther south accounts for an increase in the CO 2 amplitude of up to 59 % (0. 6 ppmv). A change in the phase of the seasonal CO 2 signal at tropical and southern stations {{has been shown to be}} strongly influenced by the onset of biomass burning in southern tropical Africa and America. Comparing simulated and observed seasonal CO 2 signals, we find higher discrepancies at southern tropical stations if biomass burning emissions are included. This is caused by the additional increase in the amplitude in the <b>prognostic</b> <b>analysis</b> and a phase shift in a diagnostic analysis. In contrast, at the northern tropical stations biomass burning tends to improve the estimates of the seasonal CO 2 signal in the <b>prognostic</b> <b>analysis</b> because of strengthening of the amplitude. Since the SDBM predicts the seasonal CO 2 signal reasonably well for the northern hemisphere tropical stations, no general improvement of the fit occurs if biomass burning emissions are considered.

The median follow-up time for all patients was 60 months. Tumors were surgically extirpated and specimens were embedded in paraffin. The PCNA positive ratio (PR) ranged from 0. 3 to 27. 8 %. The values of PCNA PR in recurrent meningiomas were generally higher than those without recurrence. When the clinical courses of the patients were compared, those with PRs under 2. 0 % were significantly higher recurrence-free ratio than those with PRs over 2. 0 %. Uniparameter analysis demonstrated that PCNA PR, tumor histology and extent of resection were significant independent variables influencing recurrence. Age, sex, tumor size, tumor location, and tumor stainining were not significant factors. The multiparameter analysis including PCNA PR, tumor histology, extent of resection and radiation were examined.

MethodsThe clinical and pathological data concerning 182 patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer, who were admitted to our hospital from January 2003 to March 2008, were retrospectively analyzed, and the relationship between clinicopathological factors and treatment outcome was analyzed. The survival rate was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method; univariate <b>prognostic</b> <b>analysis</b> was performed using the log-rank test; multivariate <b>prognostic</b> <b>analysis</b> was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model.

The 1 -, 3 -, and 5 -year survival rates were 82. 96 %, 59. 73 %, and 40. 11 %, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that the number, size, and distribution of metastatic tumors, preoperative serum carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) concentration, complications, and postoperative auxiliary therapy were prognostic factors for patients treated by radical resection of the liver metastases from colorectal cancer (χ 2 = 4. 598 、 4. 653 、 5. 327 、 4. 768 、 5. 502 、 4. 546, all P＜ 0. 05).

40|$|Clinical {{and quality}} of life (QL) {{variables}} from an EORTC clinical trial of first line chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer were used in a <b>prognostic</b> factor <b>analysis</b> of survival and response to chemotherapy. For response, different final multivariate models were obtained from forward and backward selection methods, suggesting a disconcerting instability. Quality of life was measured using the EORTC QLQ-C 30 questionnaire completed by patients. Subscales on the questionnaire are known to be highly correlated, and therefore it was hypothesized that multicollinearity contributed to model instability. A correlation matrix indicated that global QL was highly correlated with 7 out of 11 variables. In a first attempt to explore multicollinearity, we used global QL as dependent variable in a regression model with other QL subscales as predictors. Afterwards, standard diagnostic tests for multicollinearity were performed. An exploratory principal components analysis and factor analysis of the QL subscales identified at most three important components and indicated that inclusion of global QL made minimal difference to the loadings on each component. suggesting that it is redundant in the model, In a second approach, we advocate a bootstrap technique to assess the stability of the models. Based on these analyses and since global QL exacerbates problems of multicollinearity, we therefore recommend that global QL be excluded from prognostic factor analyses using the QLQ-C 30. The <b>prognostic</b> factor <b>analysis</b> was rerun without global QL in the model, and selected the same significant prognostic factors as before. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

40|$|Abstract Background Pancreatic {{adenocarcinoma}} (PCA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} lethal human malignancies, and radical surgery remains the cornerstone of treatment. After resection, the overall 5 -year survival rate is only 10 % to 29 %. At the time of presentation, however, about 40 % of patients generally have distant metastases and another 40 % are usually diagnosed with locally advanced cancers. The remaining 20 % of patients are indicated for surgery on the basis of the results of preoperative imaging studies; however, about half of these patients are found to be unsuitable for resection during surgical exploration. In the current study, we aimed to determine the clinicopathological characteristics that predict the resectability of PCA and to conduct a <b>prognostic</b> <b>analysis</b> of PCA after resection to identify favorable survival factors. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical files of 688 patients (422 men and 266 women) who had undergone surgery for histopathologically proven PCA in the Department of Surgery at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan from 1981 to 2006. We compared the clinical characteristics of patients who underwent resection and patients who did not undergo resection in order to identify the predictive factors for successful resectability of PCA, and we conducted <b>prognostic</b> <b>analysis</b> for PCA after resection. Results A carbohydrate antigen 19 – 9 (CA 19 – 9) level of 37 U/ml or greater and a tumor size of 3 cm or more independently predicted resectability of PCA. In terms of survival after resection, PCA patients with better nutritional status (measured as having an albumin level greater than 3. 5 g/dl), radical resection, early tumor stage and better-differentiated tumors were associated with favorable survival. Conclusions Besides traditional imaging studies, preoperative CA 19 – 9 levels and tumor size can also be used to determine the resectability of PCA.

Large, complex aerospace systems such as aircraft, launch vehicle and satellites are subjected to most exhaustive and comprehensive acceptance-testing program at the factory that is also used in other industries and that also suffer from the high premature failure rates. Desired/required spacecraft equipment performance is measured confirmed during factory testing, however equipment usable/mission life requirement is not measured but calculated manually and so the spacecraft and launch vehicle equipment that will fail prematurely are not identified and replaced before use. Spacecraft equipment mission-life is calculated using stochastic equations from probability reliability analysis engineering standards such as MIL STD 217. The change in the engineering practices used to manufacture and test spacecraft to identify the equipment that will fail prematurely include using a prognostic and health management (PHM) program. The PHM includes using predictive algorithms to convert equipment analog telemetry of any type into a measurement of equipment usable life by demodulating the telemetry behavior in time, amplitude, frequency and phase. The conversion of equipment analog telemetry from performance data to a measurement of usable life is done in a <b>prognostic</b> <b>analysis.</b> A <b>prognostic</b> <b>analysis</b> includes an engineering analysis that is shared with manufacturing and test, but results in premature equipment failures at rates as high as 70 % once the equipment gets to space in space, but also includes a scientific analysis of the analog telemetry so that conjecture and speculation is not used to identify the presence as systemic noise...|$|E

40|$|We {{identified}} a novel gene ST 13 from a subtractive cDNA library of normal intestinal mucosa in 1993, more {{studies showed that}} ST 13 was a co-chaperone of Hsp 70 s. Recently we detected the ST 13 gene expression in tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissue of the same colorectal cancer patient and investigated if the ST 13 gene expression might have any <b>prognostic</b> value. <b>Analysis</b> was performed at molecular level by reverse transcription-PCR using real-time detection method. We measured two genes simultaneously, ST 13 as the target gene and glyceraldehydes- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase as a reference gene, in primary colorectal tumor specimens and tumor-adjacent normal mucosa specimens from 50 colorectal cancer patients. The expression levels of the ST 13 gene were significantly decreased in primary tumors compared with adjacent mucosa (P< 0. 05). But {{there were no significant}} differences in the expression of ST 13 as compared with different Dukes’ stage, tumor differentiation grade, invasion depth, lymph node metastasis and disease-specific survival...|$|R
40|$|The poor {{prognosis}} of patients with prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) has led some clinicians to recommend allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). However, the data to support this approach is limited to case-reports and small case series. We reviewed the database of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) to determine outcomes after allotransplant for patients with PLL. We identified 47 patients with a median age of 54 years (range: 30 - 75 years). With a median follow-up of 13 months, progression-free survival (PFS) was 33 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 20 %- 47 %) at 1 year. The most common cause of death was relapse or progression in 49 %. The cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality (TRM) at 1 -year posttransplant was 28 %. The small patient population prohibited <b>prognostic</b> factor <b>analysis,</b> but these data support consideration of allotransplant for PLL. Further study of a larger population of patients is needed to determine which patients are more likely to benefit...|$|R
