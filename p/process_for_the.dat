5|$|Although the {{dominant}} use of iron is in metallurgy, iron compounds are also pervasive in industry. Iron catalysts are traditionally {{used in the}} Haber-Bosch <b>process</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> production of ammonia and the Fischer-Tropsch process for conversion of carbon monoxide to hydrocarbons for fuels and lubricants.

Construction of the segmental concrete box-girder replacement was complicated by the need to protect the wetlands below, a problem that was solved by building the bridge from the top down and taking measures to allow the concrete piers to be poured and dried during winter.|$|E

5|$|After her audience's {{demand to}} {{continue}} performing similar songs, Gočeva decided {{to record a}} second album in the same musical direction. Makedonsko Devojče 2 is a successor to the album released in 2008 and it contains songs composed in the vein of Macedonian folklore. The plans to record the album were revealed by Gočeva during an interview in May 2012 with the magazine Naš Svet, confirming that she had already begun with the song selection <b>process</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> track listing of the second edition of the project Makedonsko Devojče. In {{the initial stages of}} the album's development, Makedonsko Devojče 2 served only as a working title and later became its official title in order to emphasize that the musical style is {{the same as that of}} Makedonsko Devojče (2008).|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the {{assessment}} <b>process</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ten routes, two remained. One was route 1, the original suggestion which used the existing course of the South Forty-Foot Drain for most of its length, while the second was a new route, designated as route 11. Route 11 had become the preferred route by the summer of 2014. It involves widening the South Forty-Foot Drain from Donington to Surfleet, to a point near to the Black Hole Drove pumping station. A new lock would be needed at this location, but would connect to a new channel, rather than {{to the rest of the}} drain. It would pass under a new bridge on the A151, and the connection to the River Glen would involve another new lock. An environmental survey of other watercourses near to the route revealed that several provide habitat for nationally important plants and invertebrates.|$|E

Chicago also bid for the 1952 and 1956 Summer Olympics, without success. Mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley visited Beijing – host city of the 2008 Summer Olympics – on May 15, 2006, where he collected information on hosting.

In a November 2004 match, away at Macedonia, {{he entered the}} game in the 76th minute as a substitute for Zdeněk Grygera with the game goalless. He scored the first goal of the game with his head, before Jan Koller made the score 2–0 to win the match. In March 2005, Lokvenc again scored the deciding goal, this time against Finland in Teplice. In a game in which the Czechs had led 3–1, Finland scored twice to level the scores, however Lokvenc made the score 4–3 with three minutes remaining. Four days later, Lokvenc scored another goal, heading in a cross from Baroš, in a 4–0 away win against Andorra. In June of the same year, Lokvenc scored the first and last goals for his nation in an 8–1 home win, also against Andorra.|$|E

5|$|Electrolysis of {{a mixture}} of {{beryllium}} fluoride and sodium fluoride was used to isolate beryllium during the 19th century. The metal's high melting point makes this process more energy-consuming than corresponding processes used for the alkali metals.
