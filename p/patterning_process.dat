Present descriptions of <b>process</b> <b>patterns</b> show defects like non-uniform and unequivocal description forms and missing relationship definitions.

With the representation of different views of a <b>process</b> <b>pattern</b> catalog the <b>process</b> <b>patterns</b> and their relationships can be shown clearly. An example illustrates how a <b>process</b> <b>pattern</b> catalog and the contained <b>process</b> <b>patterns</b> are modelled.

The inability to plasma etch copper called for a drastic rethinking of the metal <b>patterning</b> <b>process</b> and the result of this rethinking was a process referred to as an additive patterning, also known as a [...] "Damascene" [...] or [...] "dual-Damascene" [...] process by analogy to a traditional technique of metal inlaying.|$|E
50|$|A key {{characteristic}} of nanoimprint lithography (except for electrochemical nanoimprinting) is the residual layer following the imprint process. It {{is preferable to}} have thick enough residual layers to support alignment and throughput and low defects. However, this renders the nanoimprint lithography step less critical for critical dimension (CD) control than the etch step used to remove the residual layer. Hence, {{it is important to}} consider the residual layer removal an integrated part of the overall nanoimprint <b>patterning</b> <b>process.</b> In a sense, the residual layer etch is similar to the develop process in conventional lithography. It has been proposed to combine photolithography and nanoimprint lithography techniques in one step in order to eliminate the residual layer.|$|E

This required the development of an additive <b>patterning</b> <b>process,</b> which relies on the unique abilities of CMP to remove material in a planar and uniform fashion and to stop repeatably at the interface between copper and oxide insulating layers (see Copper-based chips for details). Adoption of this process has made CMP processing much more widespread. In addition to aluminum and copper, CMP processes have been developed for polishing tungsten, silicon dioxide, and (recently) carbon nanotubes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Process</b> <b>Patterns</b> are a {{valuable}} means to model and execute processes. However, present <b>process</b> <b>patterns</b> have deficiencies {{with respect to}} their description. These deficiencies might prove to be an obstacle for <b>process</b> <b>patterns</b> to become a strong and useful approach for process management, since they cause ambiguity. Therefore, in this paper we propose the <b>Process</b> <b>Pattern</b> Description Language (PPDL), which embodies concepts to overcome the mentioned deficiencies. These concepts are the explicit definition of the pattern’s problem, the modularity of <b>process</b> <b>patterns,</b> the more formal definition of the pattern’s process and relationships and the specializing of <b>process</b> <b>patterns.</b> The PPDL is based on the UML and supports the everyday work of miners and users of <b>process</b> <b>patterns</b> in providing notational elements for <b>process</b> <b>patterns.</b> An example illustrates our approach...|$|R

In fact, most evolutionary evidences point to the postulate that segmentation is an independent evolutionary event that arose multiple times and that the cellular and molecular pathways of segmentation might show differences in different contexts due to this fact.|$|E
5000|$|Imprint {{lithography}} {{is inherently}} a three-dimensional <b>patterning</b> <b>process.</b> Imprint molds can be fabricated with {{multiple layers of}} topography stacked vertically. Resulting imprints replicate both layers with a single imprint step, which allows chip manufactures to reduce chip fabrication costs and improve product throughput.As mentioned above, the imprint material {{does not need to}} be finely tuned for high resolution and sensitivity. A broader range of materials with varying properties are available for use with imprint lithography. The increased material variability gives chemists the freedom to design new functional materials rather than sacrificial etch resistant polymers. [...] A functional material may be imprinted directly to form a layer in a chip with no need for pattern transfer into underlying materials. The successful implementation of a functional imprint material would result in significant cost reductions and increased throughput by eliminating many difficult chip fabrication processing steps.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{ablative}} {{nature of}} the <b>patterning</b> <b>process,</b> no development step (as in: selective removal of either the exposed or non-exposed regions of the resist as for e-beam and optical lithography) is needed, neither are optical proximity corrections. Maximum linear writing speeds of up to 20 mm/s have been shown with throughputs in the 104 - 105 μm2 h−1 range which is comparable to single-column, Gaussian-shaped e-beam using HSQ as resist. The resolution of t-SPL {{is determined by the}} probe tip shape and not limited by the diffraction limit or by the focal spot size of beam approaches, however, tip-sample interactions during the in-situ metrology process create tip wear, limiting the lifetime of the probes. In order to extend the lifetime of the probe tips, Ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) and Silicon-Carbide (SiC)-coated tips or wear-less floating contact imaging methods have been demonstrated. No electron damage or charging is caused to the patterned surfaces due to the absence of electron or ion beams.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an approach for the automated extraction of <b>process</b> <b>patterns</b> from Event-driven <b>Process</b> Chain (EPC) models in engineering domains. The manually extraction of <b>process</b> <b>patterns</b> (semantically described reference building blocks) is a labor-intensive, tedious and cumbersome task. The introduced approach comprises the three stages knowledge acquisition, <b>process</b> <b>pattern</b> extraction and generic pattern construction that are conducted automated. The presented approach {{is characterized by}} exploiting the implicit semantics of natural language terms associated with EPC model elements. Semantic patterns are employed to analyze the lexical structure of these terms and to relate them to instances of a reference ontology. Thus semantically annotated EPC model elements are input for subsequent <b>process</b> <b>pattern</b> extraction. The semantic annotation allows during pattern extraction to identify process goals of EPC functions and to organize goals into hierarchies. During generic <b>process</b> <b>pattern</b> construction, common goals of different <b>process</b> <b>patterns</b> give rise to construct generic <b>process</b> <b>patterns.</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Process art is {{an artistic}} {{movement}} {{as well as}} a creative sentiment and world view where the end product of art and craft, the objet d’art, is not the principal focus. The 'process' in process art refers to the process of the formation of art: the gathering, sorting, collating, associating, and <b>patterning.</b> <b>Process</b> art is concerned with the actual doing; art as a rite, ritual, and performance. Process art often entails an inherent motivation, rationale, and intentionality. Therefore, art is viewed as a creative journey or process, rather than as a deliverable or end product.In the artistic discourse the work of Jackson Pollock is hailed as an antecedent. Process art in its employment of serendipity has a marked correspondence with Dada. Change and transience are marked themes in the process art movement. The Guggenheim Museum states that Robert Morris in 1968 had a groundbreaking exhibition and essay defining the movement and the Museum Website states as [...] "Process artists were involved in issues attendant to the body, random occurrences, improvisation, and the liberating qualities of nontraditional materials such as wax, felt, and latex. Using these, they created eccentric forms in erratic or irregular arrangements produced by actions such as cutting, hanging, and dropping, or organic processes such as growth, condensation, freezing, or decomposition".|$|E

The fundamental knowledge of the processes in the materials, leading to modification and ablation, are systematically developed by analyzing the optical and electrical properties as well as the chemical composition of ITO and PEDOT/PSS layers after laser irradiation.

Thermal cure temperatures of first pass resist were varied from 125 °C to 200 °C, finding that temperatures less than 175 °C did not sufficiently cross-link the resist enough {{to stand up to}} the second pass of lithography, resulting in loss of first resist patterns.
