Our experiments indicate that the spectral behavior of the laser does not conform with a simple Fabry-Perot analysis; rather, it is strongly dictated by a Vernier resonant mechanism involving multiple modes, which propagate with different group velocities.

40|$|A {{feasibility}} study {{of an experiment}} to test the principle of optical stochastic cooling is presented. We propose {{to build a new}} beamline in the extraction area of the ALS Booster synchrotron, where we will include a bypass lattice similar to the lattice {{that could be used in}} the cooling insertion in a storage ring. Of course, in the single pass beamline we cannot achieve cooling, but we can test all the functions of the bypass lattice that are required to achieve cooling in a storage ring. As it is stated in, there are stringent requirements on the time-of-flight properties of the bypass lattice employed in a cooling scheme. The <b>pathlengths</b> of particle trajectories in the bypass must be fairly insensitive to the standard set of errors that usually affect the performance of storage rings. Namely, it is necessary to preserve all fluctuations in the longitudinal particle density within the beam from the beginning to the end of the bypass lattice with the accuracy of {lambda}/ 2 {pi}, where A is the carrying (optical) wavelength. According to, cooling will completely vanish if a combined effect of all kinds of errors will produce a spread of the <b>pathlengths</b> of particle trajectories larger than {lambda}/ 2 and the cooling time will almost double if the spread of the <b>pathlengths</b> is {lambda}/ 2 {pi}.
