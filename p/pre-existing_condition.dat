5|$|In July the <b>Pre-Existing</b> <b>Condition</b> Insurance Plan (PCIP) {{took effect}} to offer {{insurance}} {{to those that}} had been denied coverage by private insurance companies because of a <b>pre-existing</b> <b>condition.</b> Despite estimates of up to 700,000 enrollees, {{at a cost of}} approximately $13,000/enrollee, only 56,257 enrolled at a $28,994 cost per enrollee.|$|E
5|$|Both {{chambers}} {{worked to}} reconcile differences between their respective {{versions of the}} bill, and on April 1, 1994, the last regular day of the legislative session, the Senate passed a compromise bill, but the House killed it on a procedural motion. On April 15, {{the last day of}} the session, which legislators had set aside to override any gubernatorial vetos, the health care bill was reintroduced and passed both houses of the General Assembly. Jones then reversed course and signed it. Among the reforms included in the bill were a mechanism making the policies of all companies uniform and the creation of a Health Policy Board to regulate rate increases. It ensured that insurance companies could not deny coverage because of a <b>pre-existing</b> <b>condition</b> and allowed workers to retain their insurance after changing jobs.|$|E
5|$|During the match, she {{was knocked}} onto her right side, and {{her right arm}} became trapped {{underneath}} her wheelchair, causing a tendon in her elbow to rupture. Tracey Ferguson, the Canadian player who knocked her down tried to block the way for Australian officials to help her up. Carter lost considerable mobility in her right arm, and required an elbow reconstruction. She spent 11 weeks on a continuous passive motion machine getting treatment. Nine operations were required to treat the elbow. Because she had a <b>pre-existing</b> <b>condition,</b> the insurance company refused {{to pay for her}} treatment, although it paid her $7,500 in return for agreeing not to take legal action. Carter carried a lot of anger towards the Canadian in the first year following her accident. By 2004, she still could not fully flex her hand. Following her accident, she occasionally required the use of an electric wheelchair because of the severity of her injury, and needed the assistance of the Council's Home Care to clean her home. Before 2000, she had mostly been coached by national team coach Peter Corr.|$|E
5000|$|On April 25, 2017, MacArthur {{introduced}} {{an amendment to}} the Act that would permit states to waive out of Obamacare’s ban on <b>pre-existing</b> <b>conditions,</b> allowing insurers to charge sick people higher premiums than healthy people. However, the amendment would also dictate that health insurance offered to members of Congress and their staffs not be included in the exemption from covering <b>pre-existing</b> <b>conditions.</b> A Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted in April 2017, found that 70 per cent of Americans favored protections for <b>pre-existing</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|R

50|$|Another {{important}} and often overlooked element of international health insurance policies is the underwriting criteria {{used by the}} insurance provider. Policies are underwritten {{in one of two}} ways: moratorium; and full medical underwriting. With moratorium underwriting, applicants are not required to disclose any medical declarations, and so some <b>pre-existing</b> <b>conditions</b> may be covered; although, there are restrictions to the coverage of <b>pre-existing</b> <b>conditions.</b> New or unexpected conditions occurring after the start date are covered according to policy conditions. Full medical underwriting requires the collection of a full medical history, and usually excludes coverage of <b>pre-existing</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|R
25|$|Hypercoagulability {{states as}} a <b>pre-existing</b> <b>condition</b> in {{pregnancy}} include both acquired ones, such as antiphospholipid antibodies, and congenital ones, including factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation, proteins C and S deficiencies, and antithrombin III deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Combined oral {{contraceptives}} {{can increase the}} risk of certain types of cardiovascular disease in women with a <b>pre-existing</b> <b>condition</b> or already-heightened risk of cardiovascular disease. Smoking (for women over 35), metabolic conditions like diabetes, obesity and family history of heart disease are all risk factors which may be exacerbated by the use of certain hormonal contraceptives.|$|E
25|$|Following the debate, Paul {{was criticized}} by some {{political}} commentators for {{his refusal to}} yield in {{his opposition to the}} 2010 health insurance reform law ("Obamacare"), which prohibits insurers from denying coverage {{on the basis of a}} <b>pre-existing</b> <b>condition,</b> when it was pointed out that Paul's 2008 presidential campaign chair and friend had contracted a sudden severe illness necessitating a prolonged hospital stay before dying. He had not had any medical insurance through his employer and had been unable to purchase insurance due to a <b>pre-existing</b> <b>condition.</b> Although he had been able to receive medical care he required over the course of his illness, when he died the bills for that care amounted to about $400,000. His friends, including Paul, were able to raise about $50,000, but that still left $350,000 to be passed to his estate — or left unpaid (and passed on to other consumers and taxpayers).|$|E
5000|$|In {{most states}} in the U.S., people seeking to {{purchase}} health insurance directly must undergo medical underwriting. Insurance companies seeking to mitigate the problem of adverse selection and manage their risk pools screen applicants for <b>pre-existing</b> <b>conditions.</b> Insurers reject many applicants or quote increased rates for those with <b>pre-existing</b> <b>conditions.</b> Diseases that can make an individual uninsurable include serious conditions, such as arthritis, cancer, and heart disease, but also such common ailments as acne, being 20 pounds over or under weight, and old sports injuries. An estimated 5 million of those without health insurance are considered [...] "uninsurable" [...] because of <b>pre-existing</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|R

25|$|On September 1, 2001, a 20-year-old woman {{died of a}} {{ruptured}} {{cerebral artery}} a day after her ride. The ride was closed for several days pending an investigation.

Her family filed a wrongful death lawsuit in 2002, which was dismissed in 2006.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate has}} {{involved}} certain insurance industry {{practices such as}} the placing of caps on coverage, {{the high level of}} co-pays even for essential services such as preventative procedures, the refusal of many insurers to cover pre-existing conditions or adding premium loading for these conditions, and practices which some people regard as egregious such as the additional loading of premiums for women, the regarding of having previously been assaulted by a partner as having a <b>pre-existing</b> <b>condition,</b> and even the cancellation of insurance policies on very flimsy grounds when a claimant who had paid in many premiums presents with a potentially expensive medical condition.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two major}} {{databases}} that track radiation accidents: The American ORISE REAC/TS and the European IRSN ACCIRAD. REAC/TS shows 417 accidents occurring between 1944 and 2000, causing about 3000 cases of acute radiation syndrome, of which 127 were fatal. ACCIRAD lists 580 accidents with 180 ARS fatalities for an almost identical period. The two deliberate bombings {{are not included in}} either database, nor are any possible radiation-induced cancers from low doses. The detailed accounting is difficult because of confounding factors. ARS may be accompanied by conventional injuries such as steam burns, or may occur in someone with a <b>pre-existing</b> <b>condition</b> undergoing radiotherapy. There may be multiple causes for death, and the contribution from radiation may be unclear. Some documents may incorrectly refer to radiation-induced cancers as radiation poisoning, or may count all overexposed individuals as survivors without mentioning if they had any symptoms of ARS. The table below attempts to catalog some cases of ARS. Many of these incidents involved additional fatalities from other causes, such as cancer, which are excluded from this table.|$|E

500|$|Following the character's reinvention as the {{information}} broker Oracle, {{she has been}} regarded {{as a symbol of}} empowerment for disabled people. In Unleashing the Superhero in Us All (2008), author T. James Musler notes that [...] "or quite sometime, any handicap was considered insurmountable" [...] citing Franklin D. Roosevelt as an example, who was never photographed in a wheelchair to avoid a perception of weakness. In reference to Barbara Gordon, he states [...] "ather than quitting crime fighting, Barbara combines her intellect and computer skills to help the superhero community by gathering and passing along information." [...] Her character thus signifies that [...] "o longer is a handicap overwhelming, a person can live a strong good life, handicap or not." [...] In The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia Of Comic-Book Icons And Hollywood Heroes (2004), author Gina Renée Misiroglu observes that while disabled characters in comic books are typically utilized as gimmicks, or—as with Charles Xavier and Daredevil—are introduced with a <b>pre-existing</b> <b>condition</b> as part of their origin myth, [...] "s Oracle... Gordon stands tall as the most empowering disabled superhero. Readers witnessed her tragedy, and watched her rise above it." [...] James B. South's chapter [...] "Barbara Gordon and Moral Perfectionism" [...] in the 2004 book Superheroes and Philosophy analyzes how the changes in her life [...] "from librarian to Batgirl to Oracle" [...] drive her to pursue a higher self, illustrating the philosophical theory of moral perfectionism.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the modern}} dental profession, {{it is only}} {{recently}} when severe cases associated with bisphosphonates came to light, {{that the issue of}} ONJ has been {{brought to the attention of}} a majority of dentists. At present, the focus is mostly on bisphosphonates associated cases, and is sometimes referred to colloquially as [...] "phossy jaw", a similar, earlier occupational disease. However, the pharmaceutical manufacturers of bisphosphonates drugs such as Merck and Novartis have stated that ONJ in patients on this class of drug, can be related to a <b>pre-existing</b> <b>condition,</b> coagulopathy, anemia, infection, use of corticosteroids, alcoholism and other conditions already known to be associated with ONJ in absence of bisphosphonate therapy. The implication is that bisphosphonates may not be the initiating cause of ONJ and that other pre-existing or concurrent systemic and/or local dental factors are involved.|$|E

On May 2, 2017 Pittenger said should the AHCA become law, allowing states to waive the ACA guarantee that insurers provide coverage regardless of <b>pre-existing</b> <b>conditions,</b> that Americans with <b>pre-existing</b> <b>conditions</b> can move to a state without the waiver.|$|R

50|$|The Act uses state-run high-risk pools {{to assist}} people with <b>pre-existing</b> <b>conditions,</b> {{which could be}} {{excluded}} from insurance coverage upon repeal of the Affordable Care Act. These pools have typically required high rates, which may make them unaffordable for individuals with low incomes. H.R. 3121 would appropriate $25 billion to be spent over 10 years (or an average of $2.5 billion annually) to subsidize the high risk pools. The cost of covering <b>pre-existing</b> <b>conditions</b> {{was estimated to be}} between $15 and $20 billion per year, according to a 2010 National Affairs article. The bill would allow individuals to move between insurance plans and not be without coverage, including coverage for <b>pre-existing</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|R

50|$|The ACA {{prevents}} {{health insurance}} companies from both denying coverage and increasing premiums for individuals {{on the basis of}} <b>pre-existing</b> medical <b>conditions.</b> Tiberi co-sponsored legislation with Rep. Greg Walden to prevent this practice in the event that the ACA is repealed. According to Joseph Antos of the American Enterprise Institute, this policy would be difficult to pair with a repeal of the ACA. This is because without the individual mandate of the ACA, persons with <b>pre-existing</b> <b>conditions</b> would make up a disproportionate amount of the insured pool and drive up insurance premiums. Additionally, an amendment to the AHCA would allow states to waive the requirement that insurers not charge those with <b>pre-existing</b> <b>conditions</b> higher premiums.|$|R
