25|$|In {{an effort}} to {{complement}} the Fairtrade <b>product</b> <b>certification</b> system and allow most notably handcraft producers to also sell their products outside worldshops, the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO) launched in 2004 a new Mark to identify fair trade organizations (as opposed to products {{in the case of}} FLO International and Fairtrade). Called the FTO Mark, it allows consumers to recognize registered Fair Trade Organizations worldwide and seeks to guarantee that standards are being implemented regarding working conditions, wages, child labour, and the environment. The FTO Mark offers Fair Trade Organizations (including handcrafts producers) definable standards which inform consumers, business partners, governments, and donors of the applicable trading standard. in 2014 the Fairtrade Program Mark was introduced to create new sales opportunities, initially for cocoa, sugar and cotton producers. It has the same round logo alongside the word FAIRTRADE in black and underneath the program title in turquoise.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} for Chinese {{plugs and sockets}} (excluding Hong Kong and Macau) is set out in GB2099.1‐2008 and GB1002‐2008. As part of China's commitment for entry into the WTO, the new CPCS (Compulsory <b>Product</b> <b>Certification</b> System) has been introduced, and compliant Chinese plugs have been awarded the CCC Mark by this system. The plug is three wire, earthed, rated at 10A, 250V and used for Class 1 applications; a slightly larger 16A version also exists. The nominal pin dimensions of the 10A version are: 1.5mm thick by 6.4mm wide, the line & neutral are 18mm long, and the earth is 21mm long. It {{is similar to the}} Australian plug. Many 3 pin sockets in China include a physical lockout preventing access to the active and neutral terminals unless an earth pin (which is slightly longer than the other 2 pins) is entered first. China also uses American/Japanese NEMA 1‐15 sockets and plugs for Class-II appliances. The voltage at a Chinese socket of any type is 220V.|$|E
