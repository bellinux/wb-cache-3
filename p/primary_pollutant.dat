Photochemical smog is therefore considered to be a problem of modern industrialization. It is present in all modern cities, but it is more common in cities with sunny, warm, dry climates and a large number of motor vehicles.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{changes of the}} spatial-and-temporal {{distributions}} of air pollutants over central Taiwan after 1995, when stationary sources and automobiles were taxed for their airborne-pollutant emissions by Taiwan’s EPA. Since then, many control strategies have been implemented for improving regional air quality. SO 2 emission from point sources has been reduced by 50 % from 1997 to 2000. Emissions from Highway # 1 in 2001 were less than 1997 by 10 - 64 %. As a result, the concentrations of <b>primary</b> <b>pollutants</b> (SO 2, CO, NOx and NMHC) along the highway and the two power plants have reduced.

The degradation of air quality {{is a very serious}} environmental problem that affects urban and industrial areas worldwide.

Once emitted into the atmosphere, (<b>primary)</b> <b>pollutants</b> are transported, dispersed, transformed by gas/solid phase change and chemical reaction, and finally removed by dry and wet deposition. Most challenging {{is the fact that the}} health and environmental impacts of secondary pollutants (formed in the atmosphere) are frequently more severe than those of their precursors (<b>primary</b> <b>pollutants).</b> This is the case of ozone and other photochemical pollutants, such as peroxyacetil nitrate (PAN) and secondary particles, produced in the atmosphere by the photo-oxidation volatile organic compounds (VOC) catalyzed by nitrogen oxides (NO(sub x)).

Wet acidic deposition is what is {{commonly referred to as}} acid rain {{as it is in the}} form of rain, snow or fog. Dry deposition can be equally as important as wet deposition, but is in the form of acidic gases and particles. Scientists prefer to use the term acid deposition in referring to acid rain, as it includes both wet and dry deposition. All rain is naturally acidic with a pH of around 5. 5. The majority of the acid rain that falls in the United States has a pH of 4. 3 (www. epa. gov/airmarkets/acidrain). It is difficult to measure the percentage of acid that is in the form of wet deposition, as when rain falls it can mix with dry deposition.

In particular, a southwest northeast prevailing wind makes nonlinear variation of ozone and its precursors complex. In this study, simultaneous measurements of surface ozone (O- 3), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) were carried out from August 2009 to June 2010 to investigate ozone level and precursor concentrations in Northern China. Gucheng (GC), Longtanhu (LTH) and Xinglong (XL) were selected to represent rural area, urban area and background area in North China Plain, respectively. The results showed {{that there were two}} peaks for <b>primary</b> <b>pollutants</b> (NOx and CO) at urban and rural areas, and the highest values appeared nearly on rush hours. There was a single peak for O- 3 and O-x with peak values appearing at afternoon. The <b>primary</b> <b>pollutants</b> at urban and rural areas were higher than those in background region. However, the concentration of secondary pollutant O- 3 at downwind background areas was much higher than other sites due to transportation. Diurnal variations of pollutants indicated that O- 3 and O-x had peak values at afternoon, while other <b>primary</b> <b>pollutants</b> showed two peak values nearly on rush hours. Furthermore, high concentrations of O- 3 and O-x at background site XL also implied a robust atmospheric oxidizing ability. A positive correlation was observed between CO and O- 3 at XL site, which implied that air masses to the site had a large loading of anthropogenic emission experiencing strong photochemical processing. The correlation between CO and O- 3 was negative at GC and LTH, which indicated that local emission of precursors had significant influence on the formation of ozone. There was a positive correlation between NOx and O-x at GC and XL, which implied that NOx contributed to the formation of ozone, while a negative correlation meant titration in urban site LTH neutralized the formation of ozone due to high level of NO.
