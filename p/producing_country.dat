25|$|The United Kingdom {{was ranked}} as the 24th coal <b>producing</b> <b>country</b> {{in the world}} in 2010, with a total {{production}} of 18.2 million tonnes. Coal mining in the United Kingdom probably dates to Roman times; coal production increased significantly during the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century and peaked during World War I.

500|$|Cabernet Sauvignon (...) {{is one of}} the world's {{most widely}} {{recognized}} red wine grape varieties. It is grown in nearly every major wine <b>producing</b> <b>country</b> among a diverse spectrum of climates from Canada's Okanagan Valley to Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. Cabernet Sauvignon became internationally recognized through its prominence in Bordeaux wines where it is often blended with Merlot and Cabernet Franc. From France, the grape spread across Europe and to the New World where it found new homes in places like California's Santa Cruz Mountains, Napa Valley, New Zealand's Hawkes Bay, Australia's Margaret River and Coonawarra regions, and Chile's Maipo Valley and Colchagua. For most of the 20th century, it was the world's most widely planted premium red wine grape until it was surpassed by Merlot in the 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{marketing}} system for fair trade and non-fair trade coffee is identical in the consuming countries, using mostly the same importing, packing, distributing and retailing firms.

30|$|No country, however, is {{reported}} to have collected the zakah to the full potential mentioned above. According to some other views, these estimates seem to be far conservative. A study conducted in 1980 s on the basis of UN statistics on national accounts in eight oil <b>producing</b> <b>countries</b> and 10 non-oil <b>producing</b> <b>countries</b> concluded that oil <b>producing</b> <b>countries</b> can potentially collect 10 to 14 % of their GDP as zakah and non-oil <b>producing</b> <b>countries</b> can collect 3.5 to 7 % of their GDP as zakah (Khan 2007). The economy of the 57 Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) member states (of which 49 are predominately Muslim) have a combined Gross Domestic Product (at Purchasing power parity; PPP) of USD 7, 740 billion (CIA 2014). If only pessimistic view is considered, then total zakah amount of Muslim countries accounts for $ 139.32 billion (1.8  % of $ 7740 billion).|$|R

This thesis explores reasons why this has been the case and shows {{existing}} opportunities for <b>producing</b> <b>countries.</b> The core of the thesis is the presentation, analysis and discussion of five different value chains. These are Conventional Trade, Fair Trade, Direct Trade, Direct Trade of Roasted Coffee and the exceptional case of Juan Valdez Coffee Shops. I will show that all lead firms, except for the Juan Valdez case, are based in consuming countries. Furthermore I conclude that though Fair Trade and Direct Trade fulfill their promises, they are not able to build up a basis for further development of actors in <b>producing</b> <b>countries.</b> This is the case because actors in <b>producing</b> <b>countries</b> are not able and have few possibilities to functionally upgrade except for the cases of Direct Trade of Roasted Coffee and Juan Valdez case...|$|R

2500|$|Kiwifruit is {{native to}} north-central and eastern China. The first {{recorded}} description of the kiwifruit {{dates back to the}} 12th century China during the Song dynasty. [...] Cultivation of the fuzzy kiwifruit spread from China in the early 20th century to New Zealand, where the first commercial plantings occurred. Although kiwifruit is a national fruit of China, until recently, China was not a major <b>producing</b> <b>country</b> of kiwifruit, as it was traditionally collected from the wild. The fruit became popular with American servicemen stationed in New Zealand during World War II and later exported to California using the names [...] "Chinese gooseberry" [...] and [...] "melonette".

2500|$|The American {{share of}} world coal {{production}} remained steady at about 20 percent from 1980 to 2005, at about 1 billion short tons per year. The United States was ranked {{as the second}} highest coal <b>producing</b> <b>country</b> {{in the world in}} 2010, and possesses the largest coal reserves in the world. In 2008 then-President George W. Bush stated that coal was the most reliable source of electricity. However, in 2011 President Barack Obama said that the US should rely more on [...] "clean" [...] sources of energy that emit lower or no carbon dioxide pollution. For a time, while domestic coal consumption for electric power was being displaced by natural gas, exports were increasing. US net coal exports increased ninefold from 2006 to 2012, peaked at 117 million short tons in 2012, then declined to 63 million tons in 2015. In 2015, 60% of net US exports went to Europe, 27% to Asia.US coal production increasingly comes from strip mines in the western United States, such as from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana.|$|E
2500|$|It wasn't {{till the}} 1950s that {{domestic}} stability helped {{to usher in}} a period of revival for the Spanish wine industry. Several large co-operative wineries were founded during this period and an international market was created for generic bulk wines that were sold under names like Spanish sauternes and Spanish chablis. In the 1960s, Sherry was rediscovered by the international wine market and soon Rioja wine was in demand. The death of Francisco Franco in 1975 and the Spanish transition to democracy allowed more economic freedom for winemakers and created an emerging market with the growing [...] middle class of Spain. The late 1970s and 1980s saw periods of modernization and renewed emphasis on quality wine production. The 1986 acceptance of Spain into the European Union brought economic aid to the rural wine industries of Galicia and La Mancha. The 1990s saw the influence of flying winemakers from abroad and broader acceptance of the use of international grape varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. In 1996, the restrictions on irrigation were lifted which gave winemakers greater control over yields and what areas could be planted. Soon the quality and production volume of premium wines began to overtake the presence of generic Spanish bulk wines on the market and Spain's reputation entering the 21st century was that of a serious wine <b>producing</b> <b>country</b> that could compete with other producers in the world wine market.|$|E
60|$|There are but {{two cases}} in which duties on {{commodities}} can in any degree, or in any manner, fall on the producer. One is, when the article is a strict monopoly, and at a scarcity price. The price in this case being only limited by the desires of the buyer—the sum obtained for the restricted supply being the utmost which the buyers would consent to give rather than go without it—if the treasury intercepts a part of this, the price can not be further raised {{to compensate for the}} tax, and it must be paid from the monopoly profits. A tax on rare and high-priced wines will fall wholly on the growers, or rather, on the owners of the vineyards. The second case, in which the producer sometimes bears a portion of the tax, is more important: the case of duties on the produce of land or of mines. These might be so high as to diminish materially the demand for the produce, and compel the abandonment of some of the inferior qualities of land or mines. Supposing this to be the effect, the consumers, both in the country itself and in those which dealt with it, would obtain the produce at smaller cost; and a part only, instead of the whole, of the duty would fall on the purchaser, who would be indemnified chiefly {{at the expense of the}} land-owners or mine-owners in the <b>producing</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E

The paper also compiles data and numerical results regarding the order of magnitudes of resource rents redistribution. ...|$|R
