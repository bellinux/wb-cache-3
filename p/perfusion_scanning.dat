The {{practice}} of <b>perfusion</b> <b>scanning,</b> is {{the process by which}} this perfusion can be observed, recorded and quantified.

40|$|Objectives: Pulmonary {{embolism}} is {{a potentially}} fatal condition whose diagnosis requires helical CT scan or perfusion/ventilation scan. In emergency situations these techniques may be unavailable. The {{question was whether}} lung-perfusion scan alone could still be used as triage in an emergency department? Methods: This prospective study was performed when both helical CT scan and ventilation/perfusion scan were unavailable. During one year, 53 patients admitted to the emergency department and possibly suffering from pulmonary embolism had <b>perfusion</b> <b>scan</b> as first procedure. The referring emergency physician was thereafter asked whether the <b>perfusion</b> <b>scan</b> {{had an impact on}} patient's management and decision-making. The results of this examination were also compared to the final diagnosis at hospital's discharge. Results: <b>Perfusion</b> <b>scan</b> had an important impact in 39 patients (74 %). Nine out of the 16 patients whose <b>perfusion</b> <b>scan</b> was interpreted as high probability for pulmonary embolism had pulmonary embolism as final diagnosis. None of the 14 patients with normal <b>perfusion</b> <b>scan</b> and none of the 23 patients with abnormal and equivocal <b>perfusion</b> <b>scan</b> had pulmonary embolism as final diagnosis. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that perfusion scintigraphiy used alone remains useful as it will allow the possibility to exclude embolism in more than 20 % of the cases and as it will justify the initiation of appropriate treatment in about 30 % of the cases. It also shows that <b>perfusion</b> <b>scan</b> has an important impact on patient's management in more than 70 % of the cases. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

40|$|Background: The {{most common}} methods for {{screening}} {{of patients with}} probable ischemic heart disease are stress test and in special conditions are <b>perfusion</b> <b>scan,</b> so that their positive results was important indication of coronary angiography. Although, predictive value of <b>perfusion</b> <b>scan</b> has been considered, {{with regard to the}} impact of technical and specialized factors and according to the spread of this technique that has wrongly replaced the stress test, it is necessary to compare predictive value of this method with stress test in our country. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, patients referred to Tehran Heart Center from all centers of country between January 2004 and January 2005 for coronary angiography was included. Demographic characteristics of patients were collected by interview and clinical tests and analyzed in two genders. Then, positive predictive value (PPV) of both techniques was calculated and compared. Results: The total number of positive <b>perfusion</b> <b>scan</b> and stress test were 2178 and 2581, respectively. It was not significant difference between PPV of <b>perfusion</b> <b>scan</b> and stress test in men (86. 9 % vs 86. 6 %, P= 0. 814). PPV of <b>perfusion</b> <b>scan</b> was higher than stress test only in women more than 60 years old (P= 0. 0002). Conclusions: According to {{the results of this study}} and with regard to high cost of <b>perfusion</b> <b>scan,</b> it seems that in case the possibility of stress test, the use of <b>perfusion</b> <b>scan</b> had no advantages with the condition of our scan centers and especially in women, predictive value of these techniques were similar.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the usefulness of}} helical CT with multiplanar reconstructions and density mask in emphysematous patients candidate for lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), {{in order to assess}} the feasibility of surgery and for surgical planning. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty emphysematous patients (5 women and 15 men; age range: 55 - 67 years, mean: 61) candidate for LVRS were submitted to isotope <b>perfusion</b> <b>scanning,</b> chest radiography during maximal inspiration and expiration and Helical CT with the low volume contrast technique, multiplanar reconstructions and density mask. RESULTS: Only 8 of the 20 patients examined were submitted to LVRS. They had irregular distribution of emphysema at isotope <b>perfusion</b> <b>scanning</b> and density mask CT. Surgery consisted in an atypical resection of the upper lobe portions which appeared most damage with both techniques. Six of the remaining 12 nonsurgical patients were excluded because of homogeneous distribution of emphysema at both CT and <b>perfusion</b> <b>scanning,</b> which was incompatible with surgery. Lung transplant was considered for 4 of these patients, but only 2 of them actually received it. Three patients were excluded from LVRS because of excessive diaphragm excursion during expiration at chest radiography and of multiple confluent areas of emphysema in both lung at CT and <b>perfusion</b> <b>scanning.</b> One patient with a large area of emphysema in the right upper lobe at CT and <b>perfusion</b> <b>scanning</b> was excluded due to associated severe interstitial disease. Another patient with emphysema mainly involving the lower lobes, as clearly depicted with both techniques, was excluded because the emphysema was secondary to alpha 1 -antitrypsin deficiency, a condition known to have a less favorable surgical outcome. Finally, one patient was excluded due to a previous upper transverse laryngectomy, although CT and <b>perfusion</b> <b>scanning</b> patterns were compatible with surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In our opinion, density mask helical CT yields more accurate and clearer images than <b>perfusion</b> <b>scanning,</b> and allows the patients candidate for surgery to undergo a single examination to evaluate the extent and distribution of emphysema and to detect other possible pathological conditions. Though ours was a small series, the results suggest that <b>perfusion</b> <b>scanning</b> be integrated with density mask helical CT, the latter a very important technique for surgical planning...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: In {{patients}} with {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) noninvasive evaluation for detection of ischemia is important to avoid invasive interventions like angiography. Exercise stress test is conventionally the first study used in evaluation of CAD. Considering the noninvasive nature of the myocardial <b>perfusion</b> <b>scan,</b> we decided to compare its accuracy with stress test. Methods: Patients with chest pain, and intermediate risk for CAD underwent stress test with Bruce standard method by treadmill, and myocardial <b>perfusion</b> SPECT <b>scan</b> with Tc- 99 m MIBI {{and the results were}} compared to the angiography as the gold standard. Analysis of the data was performed by SPSS 11. 5 soft ware. Results: The study was performed on 89 patients (mean age: 55. 5, min: 29 max: 80) including 53 man and 36 women. Exercise stress test had 54 % sensitivity, 65 % specificity, 68 % PPV, 50 % NPV, while for myocardial <b>perfusion</b> <b>scan</b> sensitivity was 94 %, specificity 94 %, PPV 96 %, and NPV 92 %. Correlation between involved walls in myocardial <b>perfusion</b> <b>scan</b> with stenotic artery in angiography was 77. 6 %, while this value was 32. 7 % for exercise stress test.

40|$|Objective. To {{test the}} {{feasibility}} of a CT-compatible, ex vivo, perfused porcine heart model for myocardial perfusion CT imaging. Methods. One porcine heart was perfused according to Langendorff. Dynamic <b>perfusion</b> <b>scanning</b> was performed with a second-generation dual source CT scanner. Circulatory parameters like blood flow, aortic pressure, and heart rate were monitored throughout the experiment. Stenosis was induced in the circumflex artery, controlled by a fractional flow reserve (FFR) pressure wire. CT-derived myocardial perfusion parameters were analysed at FFR of 1 to 0. 10 / 0. 0. Results. CT images did not show major artefacts due to interference of the model setup. The pacemaker-induced heart rhythm was generally stable at 70 beats per minute. During most of the experiment, blood flow was 0. 9 – 1. 0 [*]L/min, and arterial pressure varied between 80 and 95 [*]mm/Hg. Blood flow decreased and arterial pressure increased by approximately 10 % after inducing a stenosis with FFR ≤ 0. 50.
