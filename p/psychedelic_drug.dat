5|$|Noé's dream {{project for}} many years, the {{production}} {{was made possible}} after the commercial success of his previous feature film, Irréversible (2002). Enter the Void was primarily financed by Wild Bunch, while Fidélité Films led the actual production. With a mix of professionals and newcomers, the film makes heavy use of imagery inspired by experimental cinema and <b>psychedelic</b> <b>drug</b> experiences. Principal photography took place on location in Tokyo, and involved many complicated crane shots. Co-producers included the visual effects studio BUF Compagnie, which also provided the computer-generated imagery. The film's soundtrack is a collage of electronic pop and experimental music.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Jamaica High School in 1958, Savage {{attended}} Queens College, where {{he earned a}} bachelor's degree in biology in 1963. After college Savage taught high school for several years in New York City. His first marriage in 1964 to Carol Ely ended in divorce, and he remarried in 1967 after meeting his current wife, Janet. During this time Savage also worked for famous <b>psychedelic</b> <b>drug</b> advocate Timothy Leary as keeper of the stone gatehouse on the Hitchcock Cattle Company estate in Millbrook, New York, to which Leary had been given access. Leary hired him to the post because Savage did not use LSD himself. Savage then studied at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, earning a Master of Science in botany in 1970 and a Master of Arts in anthropology in 1972. He obtained a PhD in 1978 from the University of California, Berkeley, in nutritional ethnomedicine. His thesis was titled Nutritional Ethnomedicine in Fiji.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Swiss {{scientist}} Albert Hofmann—known for {{the synthesis of}} the <b>psychedelic</b> <b>drug</b> LSD—chemically analyzed P.semilanceata fruit bodies collected in Switzerland and France by the botanist Roger Heim. Using the technique of paper chromatography, Hofmann confirmed the presence of 0.25% (by weight) psilocybin in dried samples. Their 1963 publication was the first report of psilocybin in a European mushroom species; previously, it had been known only in Psilocybe species native to Mexico, Asia and North America. This finding was confirmed in the late 1960s with specimens from Scotland and England, Czechoslovakia (1973), Germany (1977), Norway (1978), and Belgium and Finland (1984). In 1965, forensic characterization of psilocybin-containing mushrooms seized from college students in British Columbia identified P.semilanceata—the first recorded case of intentional recreational use of the mushroom in Canada. The presence of the psilocybin analog baeocystin was confirmed in 1977. Several studies published since then {{support the idea that}} the variability of psilocybin content in P.semilanceata is low, regardless of country of origin.|$|E

50|$|Psychedelic {{film is a}} film genre {{characterized}} by the influence of psychedelia and the experiences of <b>psychedelic</b> <b>drugs.</b> <b>Psychedelic</b> films typically contain visual distortion and experimental narratives, often emphasizing psychedelic imagery.

25|$|Once {{the term}} acid house became more widely used, {{participants}} at acid house-themed {{events in the}} UK and Ibiza made the <b>psychedelic</b> <b>drug</b> connotations a reality by using club drugs such as ecstasy and LSD. The association of acid house, MDMA, and smiley faces was observed in New York City by late 1988. This coincided with an increasing level of scrutiny and sensationalism in the mainstream press, although conflicting accounts about the degree of connection between acid house music and drugs continued to surface.|$|E

500|$|A 2011 {{prospective}} study by Roland R.Griffiths and colleagues {{suggests that a}} single high dosage of psilocybin can cause long-term changes in the personality of its users. About half of the study participants—described as healthy, [...] "spiritually active", and many possessing postgraduate degrees—showed {{an increase in the}} personality dimension of openness (assessed using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory), and this positive effect was apparent {{more than a year after}} the psilocybin session. According to the study authors, the finding is significant because [...] "no study has prospectively demonstrated personality change in healthy adults after an experimentally manipulated discrete event." [...] Although other researchers have described instances of <b>psychedelic</b> <b>drug</b> usage leading to new psychological understandings and personal insights, it is not known whether these experimental results can be generalized to larger populations.|$|E
500|$|The album {{includes}} an elaborate gatefold mural featuring a fantasy landscape of mushrooms (referencing the <b>psychedelic</b> <b>drug)</b> and fairies, drawn by Powell and J. F. Holmes. [...] "It {{told a story}} of happy, mystical brotherhood that was receding ever further into fantasy as the band grappled with the tragedy of Duane's death," [...] according to biographer Alan Paul. There was very little planning involved in the piece, which was created when the duo were in Vero Beach, Florida. When one would be drawing or painting the image, another would be swimming in the ocean. [...] "We swapped off this way with virtually no conversation about the drawing, just fluid trade-offs," [...] said Powell. The art was created on a large illustration board, [...] "on a one-to-one scale—it {{was the size of}} the actual spread," [...] according to Powell. Holmes' work is featured largely on the left, with Powell's on the right. Both were [...] "profoundly influenced" [...] by Early Netherlandish painter Hieronymous Bosch on the piece.|$|E
