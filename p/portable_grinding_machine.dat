40|$|Abstract. Surface {{residual}} stress distributions introduced by several surface treatments of 7075 aluminum alloy were acquired by non-destructive X-ray diffraction method. On the one hand, stress evolutions {{of the surface}} treated specimens were measured and analyzed to guide laboratory tests and engineering practices. On the other hand, the advantages of X-ray diffraction method in some test cases and reliability and accuracy of the measurements are discussed compared with the center hole-drilling method. The results show that X-ray method is flexible and accurate especially in measuring shallow surface layers stresses, which may be difficult or even be impossible to measure using traditional mechanical test methods. Different surface treatments introduce various distributed stresses and the latter treatment may remove {{the effects of the}} former one, so a practical treatment containing <b>portable</b> <b>grinding</b> wheel polishing, cross fine metallographic <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> polishing or low-speed milling, and mechanical polishing or electropolishing is suggested which can reduce the effects of external stresses introduced by surface treatments...|$|R

Conference Address: Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA. Time:APR 26 - 29, 2010. Using {{aspheric}} {{component in}} optical system can correct optical aberration, acquire high imaging quality, improve the optical characteristic, simplify system structure, and reduce system volume. Nowadays, high-precision surface <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> {{is an important}} approach to processing optical aspheric elements. However, because {{of the characteristics of}} optical aspheric elements, the processing method makes a higher demand to whole performance of surface <b>grinding</b> <b>machine,</b> and hardly to achieve ideal machining effect. Taking high generality and efficiency into account, this paper presents a compensation method for machining errors of high-precision surface <b>grinding</b> <b>machine,</b> which bases on optical aspheric elements, to achieve high-precision machining for all kinds of optical aspheric elements. After compensation, the <b>machining</b> accuracy of <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> could reach 2 um/ 200 x 200 mm. The research bases on NC surface <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> which is self developed. First of all, this paper introduces machining principle for optical aspheric elements on the <b>grinding</b> <b>machine.</b> And then error sources which producing errors are analyzed.

Through compensation software for machining error which is self designed, compensation algorithm is designed and translated compensation data into G-code for the high-precision <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> to achieve compensation machining. Finally, by comparison between machining error compensation before and after processing, the experiments for this purpose are done to validate the compensation machining accuracy...|$|R

To cool the work piece {{so that it does}} not overheat and go outside its tolerance, <b>grinding</b> <b>machines</b> incorporate a coolant.

In high-precision <b>grinding</b> <b>machines</b> (most cylindrical and surface grinders), the final grinding stages are usually set up so that they remove about 200 nm (less than 1/10000 in) per pass - this generates so little heat that even with no coolant, the temperature rise is negligible.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{comparisons}} of performance characteristics between the super-mirror face <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> using variable air pressure developed in this laboratory to grind precisely the sliding {{face of a}} surface hardened workpiece with thermal spray and the conventional one are investigated by measuring the surface roughness and hardness for a SCM 440. To process variously workpiece according to shape, size and materials, the rotating and contacting forces of the developed <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> can be changed by air pressure. The surface roughness of processed workpiece can be also attained to state of mirror face by grinding precisely the sliding face with changing the rotating speed of diamond wheel. It is possible to {{be attached to the}} various machine tools because the super-mirror face <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> using variable air pressure is a small size. The grinding efficiency is elevated because it can be worked by two or more <b>grinding</b> <b>machines</b> attached to concurrently a machine tool for the large workpiece. In this study, results show that the cusp height of the super-mirror face <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> for the particle size of 100 and 1500 No. /mm 2 is lower than that of the conventional one because the vibration is reduced by rotating very fast the diamond wheel with a pressed air and it can be processed by rotating the diamond wheel with a constantly varied air pressure perpendicular to workpiece surface, and that the workpiece in the super-mirror face <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> for the particle size of 3000 No. /mm 2 can be processed to state of mirror face that is rarely seen by the cusp height.
