40|$|The {{threat of}} an {{influenza}} A virus pandemic stems from continual virus spillovers from reservoir species, {{a tiny fraction}} of which spark sustained transmission in humans. To date, no pandemic emergence of a new influenza strain has been preceded by detection of a closely related precursor in an animal or human. Nonetheless, influenza surveillance efforts are expanding, prompting a need for tools to assess the <b>pandemic</b> <b>risk</b> posed by a detected virus. The goal would be to use genetic sequence and/or biological assays of viral traits to identify those non-human influenza viruses with the greatest risk of evolving into pandemic threats, and/or to understand drivers of such evolution, to prioritize pandemic prevention or response measures. We describe such efforts, identify progress and ongoing challenges, and discuss three specific traits of influenza viruses (hemagglutinin receptor binding specificity, hemagglutinin pH of activation, and polymerase complex efficiency) that contribute to <b>pandemic</b> <b>risk...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceSince the {{influenza}} A (H 1 N 1) {{virus has}} made headlines of newspapers in 2009, {{awareness of the}} importance of <b>pandemic</b> <b>risk</b> has risen, especially among insurers. In fact, the occurrence of a severe pandemic could cause a significant increase in mortality, and consequently might cause the bankruptcy of insurance companies. Thus, it is essential for insurers to better understand <b>pandemic</b> <b>risk.</b> This is entirely consistent with the requirements of the new European Directive Solvency 2, which encourages insurers to control all the risks they face and to hold sufficient capital for these risks. This capital can be calculated by a standard formula, an internal model or a partial internal model. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose a way of integrating the risk of pandemic influenza in a partial internal model for the death guarantee and protection business. To do so, mortality risk is split into a trend and a pandemic shock event. The model takes into account the nature of available data and of the level of segmentation chosen by the insurance company (individual or aggregate data) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{scientific}} {{understanding of the}} driving factors behind zoonotic and pandemic influenzas is hampered by complex interactions between viruses, animal hosts and humans. This complexity makes identifying influenza viruses of high zoonotic or <b>pandemic</b> <b>risk,</b> before they emerge from animal populations, extremely difficult and uncertain. As a first step towards assessing zoonotic risk of influenza, we demonstrate a risk assessment framework to assess the relative likelihood of influenza A viruses, circulating in animal populations, making the species jump into humans. The intention is that such a risk assessment framework could assist decision-makers to compare multiple influenza viruses for zoonotic potential and hence to develop appropriate strain-specific control measures. It also provides a first step towards showing proof of principle for an eventual <b>pandemic</b> <b>risk</b> model. We show that the spatial and temporal epidemiology is as important in assessing the risk of an influenza A species jump as understanding the innate molecular capability of the virus. We also demonstrate data deficiencies {{that need to be}} addressed in order to consistently combine both epidemiological and molecular virology data into a risk assessment framework...|$|E

40|$|The role {{of law in}} {{managing}} public health challenges such as influenza pandemics poses special challenges. This article reviews Australian plans {{in the context of}} the H 1 N 1 09 experience to assess whether risk management was facilitated or inhibited by the "number" of levels or phases of management, the degree of prescriptive detail for particular phases, the number of plans, the clarity of the relationship between them, and the role of the media. Despite differences in the content and form of the plans at the time of the H 1 N 1 09 emerging pandemic, the article argues that in practice, the plans proved to be responsive and robust bases for managing <b>pandemic</b> <b>risks.</b> It is suggested that this was because the plans proved to be frameworks for coordination rather than prescriptive straitjackets, to be only one component of the regulatory response, and to offer the varied tool box of possible responses, as called for by the theory of responsive regulation. Consistent with the principle of subsidiarity, it is argued that the plans did not inhibit localised responses such as selective school closures or rapid responses to selected populations such as cruise ship passengers...|$|R
40|$|During a pandemic, such {{as current}} H 1 N 1 'swine flu', {{decisions}} are made {{with a sense of}} urgency. Yet, current policies emphasise the need to ground policies on evidence. This paper studies the tension that remains in decision-making processes when evidence is weak or 'silent' due to the sudden or unpredictable course of an event. The main focus is on the so-called 'known unknowns', factors of which we have only limited or weak evidence in the <b>pandemic</b> <b>risk</b> assessment processes. These processes cover, for example, monitoring the course of the pandemic, estimating the most affected age groups, and assessing population-level pharmaceutical interventions. This paper conceptualises the 'unknown' within these processes as silence of evidence. As the case of <b>pandemic</b> <b>risk</b> assessment shows, a new, emerging situation has not yet accumulated a robust body of evidence for decision making. These uncertainties are conceptualised as silent evidence. In a similar way, historical and archaeological studies acknowledge that there is evidence that is not yet discovered, interpreted or found.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} risk communication effectiveness {{on a national level}} in Norway regarding a future pandemic. The consequences of a pandemic influenza will depend partly upon the risk communication strategy effectiveness. Within risk psychology research, such a strategy should fully consider how general and situational factors may influence public perceptions of the <b>pandemic</b> <b>risk,</b> and how public perceptions affect risk communication efficiency and, consequently, the behavior of recipients towards the pandemic. If ignored, communication gaps could result in overall greater consequences for the general public and/or unequal protection for vulnerable risk groups during a future pandemic. The overall aim of the thesis is therefore to help enhance risk communication efficiency, and thereby risk management. To address this area of research the thesis summarizes scientific research on risk perception and risk communication, and reviews experiences from prior situations and cases. The central interest of the thesis has been how public perceptions of a <b>pandemic</b> <b>risk</b> relate to risk communication efficiency and communication strategy. Scientific communication models used to address public perceptions, which may limit or hinder correct health behavior, are presented and their use in potential future pandemic settings are discussed. The thesis argues that risk communication efficiency will be strengthened by use of scientific models of communication. In this context especially models on information processing (i. e. ELM), approaches eliciting mental contents (i. e. mental models), and practical work with communication of risk (i. e. RISCOM). Predictions of future pandemics are extremely hard to make. To cover various possibilities within a future pandemic this thesis discusses risk communication challenges in situations with different combinations of possibility and consequences (severity of the virus). The idea is that different situations demand different amount of, and different approaches to, the management of risk. Lastly, an effective risk communication strategy does not stop when the <b>pandemic</b> <b>risk</b> officially subsides. It is recommended that communicators learn from the "rights and wrongs" encountered in the latest pandemic and thus ensure public trust in risk communication for the next health risk. </p...|$|E

40|$|Newly {{emerging}} influenza A viruses (IAV) pose a {{major threat}} to human health by causing seasonal epidemics and/or pandemics, the latter often facilitated by the lack of pre-existing immunity in the general population. Early recognition of candidate pandemic influenza viruses (CPIV) is of crucial importance for restricting virus transmission and developing appropriate therapeutic and prophylactic strategies including effective vaccines. Often, the pandemic potential of newly emerging IAV is only fully recognized once the virus starts to spread efficiently causing serious disease in humans. Here, we used a novel phylogenetic algorithm based on the informational spectrum method (ISM) to identify potential CPIV by predicting mutations in the viral hemagglutinin (HA) gene that are likely to (differentially) affect critical interactions between the HA protein and target cells from bird and human origin, respectively. Predictions were subsequently validated by generating pseudotyped retrovirus particles and genetically engineered IAV containing these mutations and characterizing potential effects on virus entry and replication in cells expressing human and avian IAV receptors, respectively. Our data suggest that the ISM-based algorithm is suitable to identify CPIV among IAV strains that are circulating in animal hosts and thus may be a new tool for assessing <b>pandemic</b> <b>risks</b> associated with specific strains...|$|R
40|$|High-performance {{neutralizing}} antibody {{against influenza}} virus typically recognizes the globular head region of its hemagglutinin (HA) envelope glycoprotein. To date, approved human vaccination strategies have assumed a divine-right of such antibodies as a sole means of preventing {{the consequences of}} this infection. However, frequent amino-acid changes in the HA globular head allow for efficient immune evasion. Consequently, vaccines inducing such neutralizing antibodies need to be annually re-designed and re-administered at a great expense. These vaccines furthermore provide little-to-no immunity against antigenic-shift strains, which arise from complete replacement of HA or of neuraminidase genes, and pose <b>pandemic</b> <b>risks.</b> To address these issues, laboratory research has focused on inducing immunity effective against all strains, regardless of changes in the HA globular head. Despite prior dogma that such cross-protection needs to be induced by cellular immunity alone, several advances in recent years demonstrate that antibodies of other specificities are capable of cross-strain protection in mice. This review discusses the reactivity, induction, efficacy, and mechanisms of antibodies that react with poorly accessible epitopes in the HA stalk, with the matrix 2 membrane ion channel, and even with the internal nucleoprotein. These advances warrant further investigation of the inducibility and efficacy of such revolutionary antibody strategies in humans...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePigs {{are natural}} hosts {{for the same}} {{influenza}} virus subtypes as humans and are a valuable model for cross-protection studies with influenza. In this study, we have used the pig model to examine the extent of virological protection between a) the 2009 pandemic H 1 N 1 (pH 1 N 1) virus and three different European H 1 swine influenza virus (SIV) lineages, and b) these H 1 viruses and a European H 3 N 2 SIV. Pigs were inoculated intranasally with representative strains of each virus lineage with 6 - and 17 -week intervals between H 1 inoculations and between H 1 and H 3 inoculations, respectively. Virus titers in nasal swabs and/or tissues of the respiratory tract were determined after each inoculation. There was substantial though differing cross-protection between pH 1 N 1 and other H 1 viruses, which was directly correlated with the relatedness in the viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins. Cross-protection against H 3 N 2 was almost complete in pigs with immunity against H 1 N 2, but was weak in H 1 N 1 /pH 1 N 1 -immune pigs. In conclusion, infection with a live, wild type influenza virus may offer substantial cross-lineage protection against viruses of the same HA and/or NA subtype. True heterosubtypic protection, in contrast, appears to be minimal in natural influenza virus hosts.

40|$|Top-down {{communication}} {{approaches have}} not significantly influenced {{the extent to}} which people prepare for future pandemics. Research suggests that to develop and deliver effective risk management information for a pandemic, it is necessary to gain anunderstanding of how people interpret information, and how individual and environmental factors influence these interpretations. This qualitative study set out to provide these insights. Eleven people were interviewed for this study, between October 2007 and January 2008. Interviews were semi-structured and in-depth, with an average duration of just under two hours. The sample of participants was reasonably diverse with respect to personal and environmental characteristics as well as covering a range of preparedness levels for influenza pandemic. The study was undertaken during a period in which bird flu was not prominent in the public eye; undertaking this study during a period of quiescence provided insights into the most challenging period for risk communication. Participants’ level of preparedness varied in accordance with their level of perceived risk. Those who perceived a low level of risk (7 of the 11 participants) had undertaken basic preparedness measures, and were content to keep a watching brief on the situation. Those who perceived bird flu to be a real and imminent threat had prepared more. In general, participants believed that the threat posed by bird flu can change rapidly, and that people’s levels of preparedness can be rapidly adjusted in response to the perceived level of threat. Specific preparations varied widely among participants. The five basic elements of preparedness were: stockpiling of food and water supplies; developing resilience to loss of mains electricity; acquiring first aid supplies and developing knowledge of infection control procedures; acquiring camping equipment; and acquiring specific medication such as Tamiflu. Long-term preparation strategies employed by several of the participants included developing inner strength and a strong sense of self-efficacy; maintaining or improving physical and psychological health and developing a culture of self-sufficiency and reducingreliance on external resources. To be effective, risk communication and management strategies need to address the complex web of interacting individual and environmental factors both by encouraging preparedness activities and counteracting factors impeding preparation. Participants had mitigate specific consequences so that people are convinced of the purpose of recommended actions; presenting information with honesty and integrity; and couching messages in appropriate language. Specific suggestions for risk communication that arise from this study include the following:• Adjust the content of education programmes to the actual level of <b>pandemic</b> <b>risk,</b> with thecomplexity of content increasing with increased risk. • Identify and correct misconceptions about <b>pandemic</b> <b>risk</b> and preparedness. • Incorporate pandemic preparedness communication into an all-hazards communicationstrategy. • Utilise the principles of persuasive communication to increase the credibility andeffectiveness of <b>pandemic</b> <b>risk</b> communication. • Engage communities in the development and delivery of key messages...|$|E

40|$|International audienceZoonotic agents {{challenging}} the world every year afresh are influenza A viruses. In the past, human pandemics caused by influenza A viruses had been occurring periodically. Wild aquatic birds are carriers {{of the full}} variety of influenza virus A subtypes, and thus, most probably constitute the natural reservoir of all influenza A viruses. Whereas avian influenza viruses in their natural avian reservoir are generally of low pathogenicity (LPAIV), some have gained virulence by mutation after transmission and adaptation to susceptible gallinaceous poultry. Those so-called highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) then cause mass die-offs in susceptible birds and lead to tremendous economical losses when poultry is affected. Besides a number of avian influenza virus subtypes that have sporadically infected mammals, the HPAIV H 5 N 1 Asia shows strong zoonotic characteristics and it was transmitted from birds to different mammalian species including humans. Theoretically, pandemic viruses might derive directly from avian influenza viruses or arise after genetic re-assortment between viruses of avian and mammalian origin. So far, HPAIV H 5 N 1 already meets two conditions for a pandemic virus: as a new subtype it has been hitherto unseen in the human population and it has infected at least 387 people, and caused severe illness and high lethality in 245 humans to date (Sep 08). The acquisition of efficient human-to-human transmission would complete {{the emergence of a}} new pandemic virus. Therefore, fighting H 5 N 1 at its source is the prerequisite to reduce <b>pandemic</b> <b>risks</b> posed by this virus. Other influenza viruses regarded as pandemic candidates derive from subtypes H 2, H 7, and H 9 all of which have infected humans in the past.

These preparations do not typically include planning for complete border closure. Even though border closure may not be instituted in time, and can fail, there might still plausible chances of success for well organized island nations. To estimate {{costs and benefits of}} complete border closure in response to new pandemic threats, at an initial proof-of-concept level. New Zealand was used as a case-study for an island country. An Excel spreadsheet model was developed to estimate costs and benefits. Case-study specific epidemiological data was sourced from past influenza pandemics. Country-specific healthcare cost data, valuation of life, and lost tourism revenue were imputed (with lost trade also in scenario analyses). For a new pandemic equivalent to the 1918 influenza pandemic (albeit with half the mortality rate, "Scenario A"), it was estimated that successful border closure for 26 weeks provided a net societal benefit (e. g., of NZ$ 11. 0 billion, USD$ 7. 3 billion). Even {{in the face of a}} complete end to trade, a net benefit was estimated for scenarios where the mortality rate was high (e. g., at 10 times the mortality impact of "Scenario A", or 2. 75 % of the country's population dying) giving a net benefit of NZ$ 54 billion (USD$ 36 billion). But for some other pandemic scenarios where trade ceased, border closure resulted in a net negative societal value (e. g., for "Scenario A" times three for 26 weeks of border closure-but not for only 12 weeks of closure when it would still be beneficial). This "proof-of-concept" work indicates that more detailed cost-benefit analysis of border closure in very severe pandemic situations for some island nations is probably warranted, as this course of action might sometimes be worthwhile from a societal perspective...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. Since 1997, avian {{influenza}} (AI) virus infections in poultry {{have taken on}} new significance, with increasing numbers of cases involving bird-to-human transmission and the resulting production of clinically severe and fatal human infections. Such human infections have been sporadic and are caused by H 7 N 7 and H 5 N 1 high-pathogenicity (HP) and H 9 N 2 low-pathogenicity (LP) AI viruses in Europe and Asia. These infections have raised the level of concern by human health agencies for the potential reassortment of influenza virus genes and generation of the next human pandemic influenza A virus. The presence of endemic infections by H 5 N 1 HPAI viruses in poultry in several Asian countries indicates that these viruses will continue to contaminate the environment and be an exposure risk with human transmission and infection. Furthermore, the reports of mammalian infections with H 5 N 1 AI viruses and, in particular, mammal-to-mammal transmission in humans and tigers are unprecedented. However, the subsequent risk for generating a pandemic human strain is unknown. More international funding from both human and animal health agencies for diagnosis or detection and control of AI in Asia is needed.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that 2009 pandemic H 1 N 1 influenza viruses have evolved after pandemic onset {{giving rise to}} severe epidemics in subsequent waves. However, it still remains unclear which viral determinants might have contributed to disease severity after pandemic initiation.

Among those, a mutation in the viral hemagglutinin was identified that increases 2009 pandemic H 1 N 1 virus binding to human-like α 2, 6 -linked sialic acids. Moreover, these mutations conferred increased viral replication in the respiratory tract and elevated respiratory droplet transmission between ferrets.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Influencing {{the general}} public {{response}} to pandemics is a public health priority. There is a prevailing view, however, that {{the general public}} is resistant to communications on pandemic influenza and that behavioural responses to the 2009 / 10 H 1 N 1 pandemic were not sufficient. Using qualitative methods, this paper investigates how members {{of the general public}} respond to pandemic influenza and the hygiene, social isolation and other measures proposed by public health. Going beyond the commonly deployed notion that the general public is resistant to public health communications, this paper examines how health individualism, gender and real world constraints enable and limit individual action. METHODS: In-depth interviews (n = 57) and focus groups (ten focus groups; 59 individuals) were conducted with community samples in Melbourne, Sydney and Glasgow. Participants were selected according to maximum variation sampling using purposive criteria, including: 1) pregnancy in 2009 / 2010; 2) chronic illness; 3) aged 70 years and over; 4) no disclosed health problems. Verbatim transcripts were subjected to inductive, thematic analysis. RESULTS: Respondents did not express resistance to public health communications, but gave insight into how they interpreted and implemented guidance. An individualistic approach to <b>pandemic</b> <b>risk</b> predominated. The uptake of hygiene, social isolation and vaccine strategies was constrained by seeing oneself 'at risk' but not 'a risk' to others. Gender norms shape how members of the general public enact hygiene and social isolation. Other challenges pertained to over-reliance on perceived remoteness from risk, expectation of recovery from infection and practical constraints on the uptake of vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, respondents were engaged with public health advice regarding pandemic influenza, indicating that the idea of public resistance has limited explanatory power. Public communications are endorsed, but challenges persist. Individualistic approaches to <b>pandemic</b> <b>risk</b> inhibit acting for the benefit of others and may deepen divisions in the community according to health status. Public communications on pandemics are mediated by gender norms that may overburden women and limit the action of men. Social research on the public response to pandemics needs to focus on the social structures and real world settings and relationships that shape the action of individuals...|$|E

We developed a telephone-based survey based on that framework, which was delivered across Canada in late 2008. In June, 2009, the WHO declared pandemic Phase 6 status and from the subsequent October (2009) until May 2010, the CanPREP team fielded a second (revised) survey, collecting another 1, 000 opinions from Canadians {{during a period of}} pre-pandemic anticipation and peri-pandemic experience. Methods Surveys were administered by telephone with random sampling achieved via random digit dialing. Eligible participants were adults, 18 years or older, with per province stratification approximating provincial percentages of national population. Descriptive results were tabulated and logistic regression analyses used to assess whether demographic factors were significantly associated with outcomes, and to identify divergences (between the pre-pandemic and intra-pandemic surveys). Results N = 1, 029 interviews were completed from 1, 986 households, yielding a gross response rate of 52 % (AAPOR Standard Definition 3). Over 90 % of subjects indicated the most important goal of pandemic influenza preparations was saving lives, with 41 % indicating that saving lives solely in Canada was the highest priority and 50 % indicating saving lives globally was the highest priority. About 90 % of respondents supported the obligation of health care workers to report to work and face influenza <b>pandemic</b> <b>risks</b> excepting those with serious health conditions which that increased risks. Strong majorities favoured stocking adequate protective antiviral dosages for all Canadians (92 %) and, if effective, influenza vaccinations (95 %). Over 70 % agreed Canada should provide international assistance to poorer countries for pandemic preparation, even if resources for Canadians were reduced. Conclusions Results suggest Canadians trust public health officials to make difficult decisions, providing emphasis is maintained on reciprocity and respect for individual rights.

An ethical framework, 'Stand on Guard for Thee: ethical considerations in pandemic influenza preparedness' {{that served as}} a template for the World Health Organization's global consultation on pandemic planning, was transformed into a survey administered to a random sample of 500 Canadians to obtain opinions on key ethical issues in pandemic preparedness planning. Methods All framework authors and additional investigators created items that were pilot-tested with volunteers of both sexes and all socioeconomic strata. Surveys were telephone administered with random sampling achieved via random digit dialing (RDD). Eligible participants were adults, 18 years or older, with per province stratification equaling provincial percent of national population. Descriptive results were tabulated and logistic regression analyses were used to assess whether demographic factors were significantly associated with outcomes. Results 5464 calls identified 559 eligible participants of whom 88. 5 % completed surveys. Over 90 % of subjects agreed the most important goal of pandemic influenza preparations was saving lives, with 41 % endorsing saving lives solely in Canada and 50 % endorsing saving lives globally as the highest priority. Older age (OR = 8. 51, p < 0. 05) and current employment (OR = 9. 48, p < 0. 05) were associated with an endorsement of saving lives globally as highest priority. About 90 % of respondents supported the obligation of health care workers to report to work and face influenza <b>pandemic</b> <b>risks</b> excepting those with a serious health condition that increased risks. Over 84 % supported the government's provision of disability insurance and death benefits for health care workers facing elevated risk. Strong majorities favored stocking adequate protective antiviral dosages for all Canadians (92 %) and, if effective, influenza vaccinations (95 %). Over 70 % agreed Canada should provide international assistance to poorer countries for pandemic preparation, even if resources for Canadians were reduced. While 92 % of this group, believed provision should be 7 to 10 % of all resources generated, 43 % believed the provision should be greater than 10 %. Conclusions Results suggest trust in public health officials to make difficult decisions, providing emphasis on reciprocity and respect for individual rights...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePandemic {{influenza}} virus has {{its origins in}} avian {{influenza virus}}es. The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H 5 N 1 is already panzootic in poultry, with attendant economic consequences. It continues to cross species barriers to infect humans and other mammals, often with fatal outcomes. Therefore, H 5 N 1 virus has rightly received attention as a potential pandemic threat. However, {{it is noted that}} the pandemics of 1957 and 1968 did not arise from highly pathogenic influenza viruses, and the next pandemic may well arise from a low-pathogenicity virus. The rationale for particular concern about an H 5 N 1 pandemic is not its inevitability but its potential severity. An H 5 N 1 pandemic is an event of low probability but one of high human health impact and poses a predicament for public health. Here, we review the ecology and evolution of highly pathogenic avian influenza H 5 N 1 viruses, assess the <b>pandemic</b> <b>risk,</b> and address aspects of human H 5 N 1 disease in relation to its epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} political {{norms and}} relationships associated with governance of <b>pandemic</b> <b>risk.</b> Through {{a pair of}} linked controversies over scientific access to H 5 N 1 flu virus and genomic data, it examining the duties, obligations, and allocations of authority articulated around the imperative for globally free-flowing information and around the corollary imperative for a science that is set free to produce such information. It argues that scientific regimes are laying claim {{to a kind of}} sovereignty, particularly in moments where scientific experts call into question the legitimacy of claims grounded in national sovereignty, by positioning the norms of scientific practice, including a commitment to unfettered access to scientific information and to the authority of science to declare what needs to be known, as essential to global governance. Scientific authority occupies a constitutional position insofar as it figures centrally in the repertoire of imaginaries that shape how a global community is imagined: what binds that community together and what shared political commitments, norms, and subjection to delegated authority are seen as necessary for it to be rightly governed...|$|E
40|$|Influenza <b>pandemic</b> <b>risk</b> {{assessment}} is an uncertain art. The theory that influenza A virus pandemics occur every 10 to 11 years and seroarcheologic evidence of virus recycling {{set the stage}} in early 1976 for risk assessment and risk management of the Fort Dix, New Jersey, swine influenza outbreak. Additional data and passage of time proved the theory untenable. Much has been learned about influenza A virus and its natural history since 1976, but the exact conditions {{that lead to the}} emergence of a pandemic strain are still unknown. Current avian influenza events parallel those of swine influenza in 1976 but on a larger and more complex scale. Pre- and postpandemic risk assessment and risk management are continuous but separate public health functions. “I am sure that what any of us do, we will be criticized either for doing too much or for doing too little…. If an epidemic does not occur, we will be glad. If it does, then I hope we can say … that we have done everything and made every preparation possible to do the best job within the limits of available scientific knowledge and administrative procedure. ...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{stakeholders}} expect {{organizations to}} be able to endure external shocks. Hence, the real potential of an avian flu pandemic has many corporations developing business continuity plans for the disruptions that a pandemic may cause. For the pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry, the major concerns of a pandemic include high employee absentee rates, lack of accessibility to the medical facilities, and disruption to the product supply chain. This work introduces social amplification of risk theory to evaluate the potential impact of a pandemic to a business due to heightened fear. It uses a case study of Genzyme Corporation and evaluates <b>pandemic</b> related <b>risks</b> to two of its major products. By applying a system dynamics framework to evaluate the mechanisms for the amplification of risks, a solution is proposed. The lessons introduced in this work can help organizations evaluate the true risks of catastrophic events. by Aamir Sundrani. Thesis (M. B. A.)

40|$|ABSTRACT The ongoing H 7 N 9 {{influenza}} epizootic in China {{once again}} presents us {{questions about the}} origin of pandemics and how to recognize them in early stages of development. Over the past ~ 135 years, H 7 influenza viruses have neither caused pan-demics nor been recognized as having undergone human adaptation. Yet several unusual properties of these viruses, including their poultry epizootic potential, mammalian adaptation, and atypical clinical syndromes in rarely infected humans, suggest that they may be different from other avian influenza viruses, thus questioning any assurance that the likelihood of human adapta-tion is low. At the same time, the H 7 N 9 epizootic provides an opportunity {{to learn more about the}} mammalian/human adapta-tional capabilities of avian influenza viruses and challenges us to integrate virologic and public health research and surveillance at the animal-human interface. The ongoing epizootic of H 7 N 9 influenza in Eastern China (1),associated with 132 confirmed human infections and 39 re-lated deaths (as of 18 June 2013), once again presents us questions about the origins of influenza <b>pandemics,</b> the <b>risk</b> to humans of avian influenza viruses (AIVs), and their potential to infect large numbers of humans via poultry epizootics (2 – 4). The new virus in question has a subtype 7 hemagglutinin (HA), which heightens concern because other HA subtype 7 (H 7) viruses not only hav...|$|R
40|$|Health risk {{communication}} deals with planned or unplanned communication {{to the public}} about the nature, impact and management of a wide array of health threats, such as cancer, HIV/AIDS or influenza <b>pandemics.</b> Traditional health <b>risk</b> communication models used to stress a one-way flow of health risk messages to the public. The dominant focus was on experts (government, health organizations,…) merely disseminating risk information and educating a ‘lay’ and ‘ignorant’ public about health threats. However, this simplistic top-down model of communication ignored the complex nature of the audience and the public’s understanding of risk information. Fortunately, there has been a shift away from top-down communication about health threats. This book gathers research findings and theoretical reviews with a focus on the role of mass media as sources of health risk information, the role of message formats or frames and risk information source characteristics. nrpages: 185 status: publishe...|$|R
