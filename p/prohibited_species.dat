5|$|While {{large enough}} to perhaps be dangerous, the bignose shark seldom comes into contact with humans due to its {{preference}} for deep water. This species is a bycatch of gillnet, bottom trawl, and deep-set pelagic longline fisheries (particularly those targeting tuna) {{in many parts of}} its range. It is regularly taken in Cuban waters and used to produce liver oil, shagreen, and fishmeal. Elsewhere, such as in Southeast Asia, the meat is consumed and the fins shipped to East Asia for shark fin soup. The bignose shark is not used commercially in United States, where it is listed as <b>Prohibited</b> <b>Species</b> under the 2007 Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic tunas, swordfish and sharks, or in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Stocks off {{the eastern}} United States are {{severely}} overfished; a 2006 stock assessment {{survey by the}} U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) showed that its population had dropped to 1520% of 1970s levels. In 1997, the dusky shark {{was identified as a}} Species of Concern by the NMFS, meaning that it warranted conservation concern but there was insufficient information for listing on the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Commercial and recreational retention of dusky sharks was prohibited in 1998, but this has been of limited effectiveness due to high bycatch mortality on multi-species gear. In addition, some 2,000 dusky sharks were caught by recreational fishers in 2003 despite the ban. In 2005, North Carolina implemented a time/area closure to reduce the impact of recreational fishing. To aid conservation efforts, molecular techniques using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been developed that can identify whether marketed shark parts (e.g. fins) are from <b>prohibited</b> <b>species</b> like the dusky shark, versus similar allowed species such as the sandbar shark.|$|E

5|$|The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) first {{listed the}} two known species of slow loris under Appendix II on 7January1975. All newly {{identified}} species {{were covered by}} Appendix II on 2April1977 when all primates were given either Appendix I or Appendix II protection. Appendix II only requires an export permit for international trade, as long as trade will not negatively impact the survival of wild populations. Most of the trade in slow lorises, however, is illegal and usually involves smuggling to Japan. The lack of legal trade reported to the CITES Secretariat {{is shown in the}} CITES trade database, where minimal trade by CITES Parties has been reported up until 2007. Regardless, slow lorises remained vulnerable to international trade under Appendix II, and the rampant Southeast Asian pet trade was another reason for concern. As a result, Cambodia proposed that slow lorises be elevated to Appendix I, which <b>prohibits</b> <b>species</b> from being traded internationally for commercial purposes and requires both import and export permits for certain types of non-commercial trade, such as scientific research. The proposal covered all three species recognized at the time—the Sunda slow loris, Bengal slow loris, and pygmy slow loris—because they have traditionally been managed collectively owing to a lack of knowledge as to how to distinguish them.|$|R

TEM and XRD results confirmed that Ce-Zr solid solution was formed and the particle size of Ce-Zr composite oxide powder calcined at 1073 K was still maintained within 20 - 50 nm. To avoid coating flaking, different drying methods during coating process were investigated in details. The results indicated that the microwave method was more favorable for the drying of moisture in honeycomb channels, while the oven drying method caused washcoat severely cracking. The Zn-Cr/Ce-Zr monolithic catalyst was more stable than that of no Ce-Zr washcoat because of the unique redox property of Ce-Zr mixed oxide.

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{two versions of}} a flexible sorting grid rockfish excluder in the U. S. Pacific hake fishery. The designs tested (design-A and design-B) were developed following a collaborative workshop held between gear researchers and Pacific hake fishing industry participants. Tests occurred off Oregon and Washington during 2012 aboard the F/V Perseverance. A recapture net was used to quantify the escapement of Pacific hake and nontarget species. Both designs retained a relatively high proportion of Pacific hake (> 93 %). However, the two designs did not perform equally with design-B being much more effective at reducing bycatch. Results showed rockfish bycatch was reduced by 70. 2 % under design-B and only 15. 4 % under design-A. For both designs, the mean lengths of Pacific hake caught between the codend and the recapture net did not differ significantly. A reduction in the catch of Pacific halibut and Chinook salmon, which are <b>prohibited</b> take <b>species,</b> was also noted. Unfortunately, both designs tested were only effective under slow-to-moderate fish volumes. Under heavy fish volumes both designs tended to clog.

40|$|<b>Prohibited</b> <b>species</b> {{catch is}} non-retainable catch. It {{can take the}} form of a {{prohibited}} or non-groundfish species and/or a groundfish species for which TAC has been achieved that is captured incidentally in groundfish fisheries. A PSC limit is an apportioned, non-retainable amount of fish provided to a fishery for bycatch purposes. The attainment of a PSC limit for a species will result in the closure of the appropriate fishery. Pacific Halibut The Council believes that discarding incidental catches of fish is wasteful and should be minimized. However, recognizing that in the groundfish fisheries halibut incidentally caught are MANAGED outside this FMP, the treatment of halibut as a <b>prohibited</b> <b>species</b> is appropriate in the short term. Except as provided under the <b>prohibited</b> <b>species</b> donation program, retention of <b>prohibited</b> <b>species</b> captured while harvesting groundfish is prohibited to prevent covert targeting on these species. The prohibition removes the incentive that groundfish fishers might otherwise have to target on the relatively high valued <b>prohibited</b> <b>species,</b> and thereby, results in a lower incidental catch. It also eliminates the market competition that might otherwise exist between halibut fishers and groundfish fishers who might land halibut in the absence of the prohibition. Halibut that are taken as bycatch in the trawl and fixed gear fisheries result in fishing mortality even though the FMP requires that these species be discarded. Bycatch survival rates of halibut are typically less than 100 percent and may approach zero for some fisheries and some gear. When a PSC limit is reached, further fishing with specific types of gear or modes of operation during the year is prohibited in an area by those who take their PSC limit in that area. All other users and gear would remain unaffected. However, when the fishery to which a PSC limit applies has caught an amount of <b>prohibited</b> <b>species</b> equal to that PSC limit, the Secretary may, by notice, permit some or all of those vessels to continue to engage in fishing for groundfish in the applicable regulatory area, under specified conditions. These conditions may include the avoidance of certain areas of <b>prohibited</b> <b>species</b> concentrations and will be determined on a case-by-case basis...|$|E

Data collection was conducted through interviews with the aid of semi-structured questionnaires. We interviewed 25 families, 29 residents in three communities studied during our fieldwork for data collection. Five interviews were done in Jabaquara Beach, 6 in Fome Beach and 14 Serraria Beach. During the interviews, 18 species were cited as preferred for consumption, 11 species considered to be taboo (food <b>prohibited),</b> 5 <b>species</b> were cited as avoided as food, and 4 species indicated in case of illness. The families of fishermen prefer to consume finfish and do not consume puffer fish, the latter probably due to its toxic characteristic. Fish such as little tunny, largehead hairtail, shark, serra mackerel and king mackerel are avoided by unhealthy people and in cases of wounds, inflammation, pregnancy and postpartum. Other fish, such as sea chubs, silver porgy, bluefish and grouper are reported as medicinal in these situations. Aspects related to fish consumption are part of the knowledge of fishermen and their families and provide a wealth of information that combined to biological information is useful for the conservation of fishery resources.
