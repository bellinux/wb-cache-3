5|$|The writer Ratazyayev, who {{jokes about}} using Devushkin as a {{character}} {{in one of his}} stories offends him, but genuinely seems to like him. Eventually Devushkin's pride is assuaged and their friendship is restored. The Gorshkovs come into money because the father's case is won in court. With the generous settlement they seem to be destined to be <b>perfectly</b> <b>happy,</b> but the father dies, leaving his family in a shambles despite the money. Soon after this, Dobroselova announces that a rich man, Mr. Bykov who had dealings with Anna Fyodorovna and Pokrovsky's father, has proposed to her. She decides to leave with him, and the last few letters attest to her slowly becoming accustomed to her new money.|$|E
25|$|Several {{cases have}} {{wrestled}} {{with the concept of}} initial interest confusion. In Brookfield Commc'ns v. West Coast Ent'mt the court found initial interest confusion could occur when a competitor's trademarked terms were used in the HTML metatags of a website, resulting in that site appearing in the search results when a user searches on the trademarked term. In Playboy v. Netscape, the court found initial interest confusion when users typed in Playboy's trademarks into a search engine, resulting in the display of search results alongside unlabeled banner ads, triggered by keywords that included Playboy's marks, that would take users to Playboy's competitors. Though users might ultimately realize upon clicking on the banner ads that they were not Playboy-affiliated, the court found that the competitor advertisers could have gained customers by appropriating Playboy's goodwill since users may be <b>perfectly</b> <b>happy</b> to browse the competitor's site instead of returning to the search results to find the Playboy sites.|$|E
25|$|CHP leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, {{who oversaw}} {{a drop of}} 1% in his party's vote share since the 2011 general election, issued a {{statement}} praising democracy for ousting the AKP majority government from power. Despite the CHP claiming {{that it was because}} of them that the AKP failed to win a majority, media commentators claimed that the decrease in their vote and seat share showed that it was in fact the HDP and MHP that had more of an effect on the result. CHP spokesperson Haluk Koç stated that the CHP was now in the most likely position to be included in a coalition, with Kılıçdaroğlu allegedly attempting to form a CHP-MHP minority coalition with outside support from the HDP. Kılıçdaroğlu appeared to have refused to consider a coalition with the AKP. In response to a question of whether he would resign after presiding over a decrease in the CHP vote, Kılıçdaroğlu refused to comment but claimed that he was <b>perfectly</b> <b>happy</b> with the election result. Despite this, the President of the Turkish Bars Association and CHP member Metin Feyzioğlu stated that a convention should be called due to the poor election result. The drop in the CHP's vote share was largely attributed to CHP voters tactically voting for the HDP to increase the chances of them surpassing the 10% parliamentary threshold.|$|E

The parties did not undertake a formal engagement, but assumed that the match would take place in due time.|$|E
500|$|Griffin {{dismissed}} {{criticism of}} his performance, saying [...] "people who have always been against the BNP will say that I couldn't answer some things." [...] He was {{of the opinion that}} he had been shown [...] "extraordinary hostility" [...] by the main political parties, but that he was happy having done his best. Griffin said: [...] "I can see that millions of people who don't usually watch Question Time will remember what I've said and think that's how they feel and I'm <b>perfectly</b> <b>happy</b> with that." [...] He also said he expected the BNP would appear on Question Time again. The BNP legal officer, Lee Barnes, described Griffin's performance as [...] "failing to press the attack", and the Evening Standard reported a possible challenge to Griffin's leadership from a faction within the BNP, linked to Chris Jackson, which was dissatisfied with his performance, but rated this chance of success as low.|$|E
500|$|In 1930, Broadway {{was being}} heavily scouted for actors {{to work in}} the [...] "talkies", the new medium of sound film. Tracy was cast in two Vitaphone short movies (Taxi Talks and The Hard Guy), but he had not {{considered}} becoming a film actor: [...] "I had no ambition in that direction and I was <b>perfectly</b> <b>happy</b> on the stage", he later explained in an interview. One of the scouts who saw Tracy in The Last Mile was director John Ford. Ford wanted Tracy for the lead role in his next picture, a prison movie. Production company Fox Film Corporation were unsure about Tracy, saying that he did not photograph well, but Ford convinced them that he was right for the role. Up the River (1930) marked the film debut of both Tracy and Humphrey Bogart. After seeing the rushes, Fox immediately offered Tracy a long-term contract. Knowing that he needed the money for his family—his young son was deaf and recovering from polio—Tracy signed with Fox and moved to California. He appeared on the stage again only once more in his life.|$|E

500|$|In June 1911 Heseltine {{learned that}} Thomas Beecham was {{to conduct an}} all-Delius concert at London's Queen's Hall on the 16th of that month, at which the {{composer}} would be present, and his Songs of Sunset would be given its first performance. Colin Taylor, a sympathetic Eton piano tutor, secured permission from the school for Heseltine to attend the event. Prior to this, his mother had contrived to meet Delius in her London home; as a consequence, during the concert intermission Heseltine {{was introduced to the}} composer. The next day he wrote Delius a long appreciative letter: [...] "I cannot adequately express in words the intense pleasure it was to me to hear such perfect performances of such perfect music". He told his mother that [...] "Friday evening was the most <b>perfectly</b> <b>happy</b> evening I have ever spent, and I shall never forget it". Delius became the first strong formative influence of Heseltine's compositional career, and although the initial adulation was later modified, a friendship began that would largely endure for the remainder of Heseltine's life.|$|E
500|$|Disagreements {{about the}} {{ownership}} of the story ultimately led Moore to sever ties with DC Comics. Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for Watchmen. Speaking at the 1985 San Diego Comic-Con, Moore said: [...] "The way it works, if I understand it, is that DC owns it for the time they're publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we {{can make all the}} money from the Slurpee cups." [...] For Watchmen, Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series' earnings. Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when [...] "DC have not used the characters for a year, they're ours." [...] Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them [...] "a substantial amount of money" [...] to retain the rights. Moore added, [...] "So basically they're not ours, but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be. On the other hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn't want to do anything with them, then after a year we've got them and we can do what we want with them, which I'm <b>perfectly</b> <b>happy</b> with." ...|$|E

The second single, [...] "Tommy and Krista", was released in September, which peaked at No.10 in New Zealand. Another single, [...] "All My Life", was featured in the promotional clips for the 2010 AFL grand final. Its music video was directed by Adrian Van de Velde and was shot in early October in Bangkok, Thailand. The narrative is a 'heroic love' set on a local military base and features Russian model-actress Maria Mazikova, together with 50 Thai army troops, an Iroquois helicopter, and a Chinook helicopter. In November Lip Magazines Shannon Andreucci reviewed a live gig, [...] " [...] are certainly no Pixies, Beatles or Sex Pistols.

60|$|Bertha was <b>perfectly,</b> perilously <b>happy.</b> It {{was almost}} her first {{escape from the}} {{brooding}} care and weight of Haney's presence. She felt as she used to feel when speeding away on swift gallop to the ranch with some companion as care-free as herself. Since that fateful day when her mother fell ill and Marshall Haney {{asked her to marry}} him, she had not been permitted an hour's holiday. Even when absent from her husband her mind carried an inescapable picture of his loneliness and helplessness, and no complete relaxation had come with her temporary freedom. This day, this hour, she was suddenly free from care, from pain, from all uneasiness.|$|R

Her father had to learn not to see her blithe obliviousness, or it would have sent him mad. She was so radiant with all things, in her possession of perfect hostility.|$|R
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 29, 1910. It states: [...] "Marie is the tiny daughter of a well to do farmer. On Halloween her father, to amuse her, picks a pumpkin that she selects, and fashions a jack-o-lantern out of it. Her new toy pleases the child immensely, and at once takes a place in her affections equal to that held by her dollie. So it is natural {{that she should be}} thinking about the two of them when she is tucked into bed and falls asleep. Perhaps that was why the queen of the fairies came to her and invited her to a Halloween party that her loyal subjects were giving in their woodland retreat. And so that Marie would be <b>perfectly</b> <b>happy,</b> not feel embarrassed among strangers, the queen asked Dollie and Pumpkin to be her guests also. And, as a further mark of favor, she waved her hand, and Dollie and Pumpkin could run around and talk as well as Marie could. It certainly made it more enjoyable for the little girl. A fairy Halloween party is one of the finest things going in the amusement line, and only very nice and very good little girls are invited to them. As Marie filled these requirements, she had a perfectly glorious time, but was inclined to weep when she woke up later in her own little bed, and found that her toys had lost their miraculous gift of life. But it consoled her somewhat to have them, for they served as reminders of her wonderful evening. And perhaps the fairies will ask her to attend another party later. If they do, she has decided that Pumpkin and Dollie must have their shares of the good times as before." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to actor Gere, {{an early}} {{draft of the}} screenplay, which he read several years ago, {{presented}} the Sumners as suffering from a dysfunctional sexual relationship. It gave Connie some justification for having an affair. According to the actor and to director Lyne, the studio wanted to change the storyline so that the Sumners had a bad marriage with no sex, to create greater sympathy for Connie. Both men opposed the change; Lyne in particular felt that the studio's suggestions would have robbed the film of any drama: [...] "I wanted two people who were <b>perfectly</b> <b>happy.</b> I loved {{the idea of the}} totally arbitrary nature of infidelity." [...] The Sumners' relationship was rewritten as a good marriage, with her affair the result of a chance meeting.|$|E
2500|$|Following the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court {{decision}} Brown v.

[...] Twice, in 1955 and 1957, {{when asked if they}} favored integration, the citizens on the committee stated they [...] "were <b>perfectly</b> <b>happy</b> with their school and would like to be left alone." [...] In 1964, the issue was raised again when the school board voted to let students of the Plano Colored School, by then renamed the Frederick Douglass School, decide if they wanted to integrate with Plano High School.

[...] The 1964–1965 football team, the first integrated team for the school, won the first state championship in school history, helping to ease racial tensions.

2500|$|Most emphatically in The Sickness Unto Death, Kierkegaard's author {{argues that}} the human self is a {{composition}} of various aspects that must be brought into conscious balance: the finite, the infinite, a consciousness of the [...] "relationship of the two to itself," [...] and a consciousness of [...] "the power that posited" [...] the self. The finite (limitations such as those imposed by one's body or one's concrete circumstances) and the infinite (those capacities that free us from limitations such as imagination) always exist {{in a state of}} tension. That tension between two aspects of the [...] "self" [...] that must be brought into balance. When the self is out of balance, i.e., has the wrong understanding of who it is because it conceives itself too much in terms of its own limiting circumstances (and thus fails to recognize its own freedom to determine what it will be) or too much in terms of what it would like to be, (thus ignoring its own circumstances), the person {{is in a state of}} despair. Notably, Anti-Climacus says one can be in despair even if one feels <b>perfectly</b> <b>happy.</b> Despair is not just an emotion, in a deeper sense it is the loss of self, i.e., it describes the state when one has the wrong conception of oneself.|$|E

He was soon housed {{with a series of}} cell mates, and after five months and a personal appeal from Count Bragadin was given warm winter bedding and a monthly stipend for books and better food. During exercise walks he was granted in the prison garret, he found a piece of black marble and an iron bar which he smuggled back to his cell; he hid the bar inside his armchair. When he was temporarily without cell mates, he spent two weeks sharpening the bar into a spike on the stone. Then he began to gouge through the wooden floor underneath his bed, knowing that his cell was directly above the Inquisitor's chamber. Just three days before his intended escape, during a festival when no officials would be in the chamber below, Casanova was moved to a larger, lighter cell with a view, despite his protests that he was <b>perfectly</b> <b>happy</b> where he was. In his new cell, [...] "I sat in my armchair like a man in a stupor; motionless as a statue, I saw that I had wasted all the efforts I had made, and I could not repent of them. I felt that I had nothing to hope for, and the only relief left to me was not to think of the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{campaign}} led {{to numerous}} other controversies, especially concerning the Prussians. For example: Were Wellington's troop dispositions prior to Napoleon's invasion of Belgium sound? Did Wellington somehow mislead or betray Blücher by promising, then failing, to come directly to Blücher's aid at Ligny? Who deserved the lion's share {{of credit for}} the victory—Wellington or the Prussians? These and other such issues concerning Blücher's, Wellington's, and Napoleon's decisions during the campaign were {{the subject of a}} major strategic-level study by the famous Prussian political-military theorist Carl von Clausewitz, Feldzug von 1815: Strategische Uebersicht des Feldzugs von 1815, English title: The Campaign of 1815: Strategic Overview of the Campaign. Written c.1827, this study was Clausewitz's last such work and is widely considered to be the best example of Clausewitz's mature theories concerning such analyses. It attracted the attention of Wellington's staff, who prompted the Duke to write his only published essay on the campaign (other than his immediate, official after-action report, [...] "The Waterloo Dispatch"), his 1842 [...] "Memorandum on the Battle of Waterloo". While Wellington disputed Clausewitz on several points, the Prussian writer largely absolved Wellington of accusations levelled against him by nationalistic German axe-grinders. This exchange with Clausewitz was quite famous in Britain in the 19th century (it was heavily discussed in, for example, Chesney's Waterloo Lectures (1868).) It seems, however, to have been systematically ignored by British historians writing since 1914, which is odd considering {{that it was one of}} only two discussions of the battle that Wellington wrote. The explanation, unfortunately, is probably that it drew too much attention to the decisive German role in Wellington's victory—which Wellington himself was <b>perfectly</b> <b>happy</b> to acknowledge, but which became an awkward subject given Anglo-German hostilities in the 20th century.|$|E
