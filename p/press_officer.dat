5|$|The {{day after}} Cleave's article {{appeared}} in the Evening Standard, Beatles <b>press</b> <b>officer</b> Tony Barrow offered Datebook, a US teen magazine, rights to all four interviews. Barrow believed the pieces were important to show fans that the Beatles were progressing beyond simple pop music and producing more intellectually challenging work. As Datebook was a socially progressive magazine that addressed subjects such as interracial dating and legalization of marijuana, {{it seemed like a}} suitable vehicle to carry this information.|$|E

By this time, Minh's junta had been replaced in a 1964 January coup by Khánh. It is suspected {{that one of the}} generals' motives for deploying Thảo overseas was his continual involvement in plotting. Khánh appointed Thảo as his <b>press</b> <b>officer</b> as well as an unofficial political adviser.|$|E

Using this as a starting point, this article draws on interviews with 10 UK-based science <b>press</b> <b>officers,</b> which explored how they view their role as science reporters and as generators of expectations. Using Goodwin's notion of 'professional vision', we argue that science <b>press</b> <b>officers</b> have a specific professional vision that shapes how they produce biomedical press releases, engage in promotion of biomedical research {{and make sense of}} hype. We discuss how these insights can contribute to the sociology of expectations, as well as inform responsible science communicatio...|$|R

5|$|Harry and {{his wife}} moved to London in 1966 and was engaged as a public {{relations}} (P.R.) for the Kinks and the Hollies. During the next 18 years he was the P.R. to many artists, including Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Procol Harum, David Bowie, Led Zeppelin, the Beach Boys, Clouds, Ten Years After, Free, Mott the Hoople, the Pretty Things, Christine Perfect, Supertramp, Hot Chocolate, Suzi Quatro and Kim Wilde. During his time working as a <b>press</b> <b>officer,</b> Harry started a monthly magazine called Tracks, which reported the latest album releases, and another magazine, Idols: 20th Century Legends, which ran for 37 issues, from 1988 to 1991. Harry also compiled a 34-track compilation, Mersey Beat, for Parlophone records, which was released on 31 October 1983.|$|E
5|$|On {{the back}} of the cover, the UK album {{contained}} a review of the White Album written for The Observer by Tony Palmer.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, in which the ensemble's battle with the Blue Meanies was compared to three other epic struggles {{in the history of the}} English-speaking world: Beowulf's struggle to save the Heorot mead hall, King John's signing of the Magna Carta and Thomas Jefferson's writing of the Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{returned}} to the War Department, where {{he was promoted to}} major on 11 December 1915. In June 1916, he was assigned as head of the Bureau of Information at the office of the Secretary of War, Newton D. Baker. MacArthur has since been regarded as the Army's first <b>press</b> <b>officer.</b> Following the declaration of war on Germany on 6 April 1917, Baker and MacArthur secured an agreement from President Wilson {{for the use of the}} National Guard on the Western Front. MacArthur suggested sending first a division organized from units of different states, so as to avoid the appearance of favoritism toward any particular state. Baker approved the creation of this formation, which became the 42nd ("Rainbow") Division, and appointed Major General William A. Mann, the head of the National Guard Bureau, as its commander; MacArthur was its chief of staff, with the rank of colonel. At MacArthur's request, this commission was in the infantry rather than the engineers.|$|E

5|$|On 13 September 1964, Epstein {{approached}} Harry {{to create}} a national music paper, so Harry coined the name Music Echo, and gradually merged Mersey Beat into it. Epstein had promised Harry full editorial control, but then hired a female <b>press</b> <b>officer</b> in London to write a fashion column and a D.J. to write a gossip column, without informing Harry of his intentions, leaving Harry with no other option but to resign. The paper subsequently ran into financial problems, and Epstein had to merge it with another paper, becoming the Disc & Music Echo. When Harry and his wife moved to London in 1966, he was already contributing a column for the magazine Weekend and also for the teen magazines Marilyn and Valentine. He then became the feature writer, news editor and columnist for Record Mirror (using various pseudonyms such as 'Brenda Tarry' and 'David Berglas'), and wrote features for Music Now (under the name of Nick Blaine) for Record Retailer.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe's {{leadership}} of the Liberals was not, initially, an unqualified success; his local campaigning skills did not readily transfer to set speeches on national or international issues, and some sections of the party became restless. His engagement to Caroline Allpass, announced in April 1968, reassured those in the party who had reservations about his private life; others were shocked by Thorpe's emphasis on the political motivation for the marriage—worth five points in the polls, he opined to Mike Steele, the party's <b>press</b> <b>officer.</b> For much of 1968 Thorpe was untroubled by Scott, who had acquired new friends and, according to Bessell, had burned his Thorpe letters. His reappearance in November 1968, again penniless and without prospect of work, was particularly unwelcome to Thorpe, as he fought to establish his leadership credentials. Bessell provided immediate relief by resuming the weekly cash retainer, {{but this was a}} short-term respite.|$|E
5|$|While {{the party}} was in power, press {{secretary}} Alastair Campbell installed a centralised organisation to co-ordinate government communication and impose a united message to be delivered by ministers. Charlie Whelan, Gordon Brown's <b>press</b> <b>officer,</b> was often in conflict with Campbell because of the former's attempts to brief the press by his own initiatives; this continued until his resignation in 1999. Campbell followed a professional approach to media relations {{to ensure that a}} clear message was presented, and the party planned stories in advance to ensure a positive media reaction. Campbell used his own experience in journalism; he was known for his attention to detail and effective use of sound bites. Campbell developed a relationship with News International, providing their newspapers with early information in return for positive media coverage.|$|E

5|$|Bormann took a {{job with}} Der Nationalsozialist, a weekly paper edited by NSDAP member Hans Severus Ziegler, who was deputy Gauleiter (party leader) for Thuringia. After joining the NSDAP in 1927, Bormann began duties as {{regional}} <b>press</b> <b>officer,</b> but his lack of public-speaking skills made him ill-suited to this position. He soon put his organisational skills to use as business manager for the Gau (region). He moved to Munich in October 1928, where {{he worked in the}} SA insurance office. Initially the NSDAP provided coverage through insurance companies for members who were hurt or killed in the frequent violent skirmishes with members of other political parties. As insurance companies were unwilling to pay out claims for such activities, in 1930 Bormann set up the Hilfskasse der NSDAP (NSDAP Auxiliary Fund), a benefits and relief fund directly administered by the party. Each party member was required to pay premiums and might receive compensation for injuries sustained while conducting party business. Payments out of the fund were made solely at Bormann's discretion. He began to gain a reputation as a financial expert, and many party members felt personally indebted to him after receiving benefits from the fund. In addition to its stated purpose, the fund was used as a last-resort source of funding for the NSDAP, which was chronically short of money at the time. After the NSDAP's success in the 1930 general election, where they won 107 seats, party membership grew dramatically. By 1932 the fund was collecting 3 million Reichsmarks per year.|$|E
