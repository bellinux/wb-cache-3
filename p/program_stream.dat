Using Mode 2 Form 2 allows roughly 800 megabytes of VCD data to be stored on one 80 minute CD (versus 700 megabytes when using CD-ROM Mode 1). [...] This is achieved by sacrificing the error correction redundancy present in Mode 1. [...] It was considered that small errors in the video and audio stream pass largely unnoticed. [...] This, combined with the net bitrate of VCD video and audio, means that almost exactly 80 minutes of VCD content can be stored on an 80-minute CD, 74 minutes of VCD content on a 74-minute CD, and so on. This was done in part to ensure compatibility with existing CD drive technology, specifically the earliest [...] "1x" [...] speed CD drives.|$|E
