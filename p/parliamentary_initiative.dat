25|$|In October 1985, the {{moderate}} {{section of the}} former ALÖ met in Salzburg and formed the Citizen's <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Initiative</b> (BIP) {{as an attempt to}} bring together a more professionalised and less ideologically divided Green political organisation. The meeting was arranged under the auspices of former ALÖ leaders Günther Nenning, Gerhard Heilingbrunner and Michael Mayrhofer. Meissner-Blau {{and a number of other}} leading greens figures were in attendance at the first meeting on October 26, 1985. As a well spoken, widely respected and nationally known figure in the environmental movement, Meissner-Blau was nominated by the BIP to run as the first green candidate for the Austrian Presidency at a meeting in Graz on January 6, 1986. In February, the opposing left-wing of the former ALÖ declined to join the BIP, instead forming their own Green political movement - the Green Alternative Rally (GRAS). Momentum appeared to be on the side of the BIP though, as a number of green fractions moved over to join with the BIP. The media gave a large degree of attention to Meissner-Blau in the lead-up to the May Presidential vote. The movement's profile received a significant boost after the Chernobyl disaster in April and government controversy over the government deployment of the Saab 35 Draken fighter airplane. On May 4, Meisser-Blau received 5.5% of the vote. The result, whilst still small, was the best result for the Green movement to that point, and the campaign had cemented Meissner-Blau's position at the apex of that movement.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the micro level variation in media responsiveness by political elites. It hypothesizes that individual political goals, {{in addition to}} party position, affect {{the extent to which}} MPs’ <b>parliamentary</b> <b>initiatives</b> are inspired by media cues. Regression analysis on data from a survey with Belgian national parliamentarians confirms this assumption. Opposition MPs react more to the media than coalition MPs. Within parties, MPs who are focused on party political goals display higher levels of media responsiveness than MPs who are not. The findings are explained by the differential usefulness of news coverage for various political actors...|$|R
30|$|The Swiss Parliament plays {{a strong}} formal role in legislation. It can refuse a {{governmental}} bill without discussing its content {{and can make}} detailed changes. By <b>parliamentary</b> <b>initiatives,</b> it can also make laws without the involvement of government and administration. It has a question right (Anfrage) {{and the right to}} request a response to a question (Interpellation) from government. Moreover, there are the instruments of Postulat in which Parliament asks government to examine whether {{it would be possible to}} draft a law and the Motion, which orders a governmental bill. Due to the strong role played by the government in the Swiss political system, the political majority in Parliament is less concerned with retaining the power of government and can play an independent and strong role as well (Linder 1999 a: 462).|$|R

40|$|Martin Brunner aims at {{solving the}} puzzle of why {{opposition}} parties or government backbenchers propose legislation even though the chance to influence policy outcomes in this manner is almost nil. He argues that instead of influencing policies directly most parliamentary bills serve different purposes: They are used in order to signal own policy positions and to show alternatives to government policies. Or they point at topics that rank high on the public agenda but low on the government agenda. They {{can also be a}} means for individual Members of Parliament to build up an independent personal profile. Using formal models and comparative empirical evidence from Belgium, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom the author shows that <b>parliamentary</b> <b>initiatives</b> of opposition and backbenchers are not simply “much ado about nothing”, but the result of vote-seeking motivations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} the results of a study about the legislation of institutional advertising in the Spanish Congress, which is understood as an arena for political communication. The research is focused on the analysis of the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>initiatives</b> and the corresponding parliamentary debates, with special emphasis on the legislative initiatives prior to the 2005 Law of Advertising and Institutional Communication, and its value as predecessor of other regulations. The first proposal of the law, still rejected, was taken by different political forces as the basis for subsequent regulative proposals concerning institutional advertising. The position of different groups, and their arguments, shows a clear lack of coherence in many cases. The comparison of the different initiatives in different Spanish chambers –and the debates around them- is a first step to establish the policy memory which, beyond the specific case of institutional communication, becomes a very useful instrument in the field of Political Communication...|$|R

40|$|Please note: This {{article is}} in Greek. Patriotism and Deconstruction in Greece in the Period of Crisis: An Attempt at Synthesis. The {{polarity}} patriotism/deconstruction has dominated public debates in Greece {{in the period}} of crisis, and postmodernism has exerted a significant influence on politics, culture and the education community since the entry of the country to the Eurozone in the mid- 1990 s. Given that these developments took place in a society with ongoing external financial support, this article examines the standpoint of collective subjects of self-determination emerging in the post-Junta era, such as radical feminists, extra <b>parliamentary</b> <b>initiatives</b> and groups related to the New Age movement, towards self-determination of the country. The analysis points to an asymmetry between global inflows and local material and knowledge production, which fuels divisions and misconceptions in identity issues. It further discusses the possible usage of deconstruction as an ontological principle in contrast to that of an investigatory and reflective tool that takes into account the relational frame to which it is applied...|$|R

In Inside Story, Brian Costar and Jennifer Curtin look at the precedents FROM THE mid- 1980 s, with the growing number and influence of independent and small-party MPs in Australian parliaments, an important new ingredient emerged in state and territory politics: charters negotiated between independent MPs (or, in one case, the Greens) and the major parties as a precondition for supporting a minority government. These charters usually committed the governing party {{to a range of}} <b>parliamentary</b> <b>initiatives</b> to promote executive accountability and honesty; in return, the independents undertook not to bring down the government by voting against supply or confidence motions.

40|$|This SIGMA {{publication}} {{is made up}} of {{a general}} report, six country reports and several appendices, such as relevant regulations and the OECD checklist for regulatory decision–making. The general report on law drafting and regulatory management is designed as a hands-on tool for policymakers and law drafting personnel. It points out crucial issues for improving law drafting through creating and enforcing an adequate institutional framework, improving policy development, setting and maintaining law drafting standards, making fuller use of consultation, and improving access to legislation. This report also explains how procedures and standards should be applied to <b>parliamentary</b> <b>initiatives</b> and secondary legislation, as well as discussing the training of law drafters. The country reports offer a full account of law drafting regulations and drafting practice in Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Slovenia. While reforming regulatory programmes in any democracy is a major endeavour replete with potential pitfalls, central and eastern European countries confront even greater challenges in this area. They must build up regulatory frameworks for economic and political conditions radically different than those which existed just a few years before. In particular, these countries must align their regulatory practices with those of the European Union. This implies the creation of new institutions, and control and monitoring systems. ...|$|R
5000|$|Switzerland: On 5 December 2013 the Green Liberal Party of Switzerland {{submitted}} a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>initiative</b> to the National Council, proposing {{a constitutional amendment}} allowing couples {{to enter into a}} marriage or civil union irrespective of sex and sexual orientation. On 20 February 2015 the lower house's Justice Committee recommended approval of the proposal. On 1 September 2015, it was also approved by the upper house's Justice Committee, paving the way for a referendum on the constitutional amendment. On 16 June 2017, the Federal Assembly voted by 118-71 in favour of a proposal by the Green Liberal party to launch a parliamentary study on same-sex marriage. Any change in the law would have to be passed by Swiss voters in a referendum as it would require constitutional change. The vote in parliament gave the legal affairs committee until summer 2019 to draw up a bill to legalise same-sex marriage.|$|E
50|$|In early 1926, {{the mood}} within the SPD changed. Discussions on the {{inclusion}} of social democrats in the national government finally broke down in January, so the SPD was then able to concentrate more on opposition politics. This was also the reason for rejecting another bill that had been drawn up by the second cabinet of Hans Luther. This bill, which was finally presented on 2 February, provided for a new legal construction to handle the issue. A special court under {{the chairmanship of the}} Supreme Court President Walter Simons would have sole responsibility for the assets disputes. There was no provision for review of existing agreements between the states and the former ruling houses. Compared with the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>initiative</b> of the DDP from November 1925, this was a development that was favourable to the former ruling houses. For the SPD leadership, these factors were important but secondary; the main reason for the change of mood in the SPD leadership was something else: {{at the base of the}} SPD, there was a clear support for the legislative initiative of the Communist Party, and the party leadership feared significant loss of influence, members and voters if they ignored this sentiment.|$|E
50|$|But {{there is}} {{currently}} no regulation at all for lobbying activities in France and, as a consequence, this practice suffers {{from a lack of}} transparency. There is no regulated access to the French institutions and no register specific to France, but there is one for the European Union where French lobbyists can register themselves. For example, the internal rule of the National Assembly (art. 23 and 79) forbids members of Parliament to be linked with a particular interest. However, MPs don’t have to declare their interest and the list of MPs' assistants is not public. Also, there is no rule at all for consultation of interest groups by the Parliament and the Government. Nevertheless, a recent <b>parliamentary</b> <b>initiative</b> (motion for a resolution) has been launched by several MPs so as to establish a register for representatives of interest groups and lobbyists who intend to lobby the MPs. The purpose of this initiative is to introduce standards of conduct and access to the National Assembly. Through the use of a register, these standards of conduct and access will enable the Assembly to identify and maintain a list of the representatives of interest groups who follow legislative activity and to supervise fully the access of those representatives to the National Assembly. This motion has not been adopted yet.|$|E
