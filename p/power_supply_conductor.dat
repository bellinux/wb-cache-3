5000|$|The {{decoupling}} capacitor works as the device’s local energy storage. The capacitor is placed between power line and {{ground to the}} circuit that current is to be provided. According to capacitor equation, i(t) = CdV(t)/dt, voltage drop between power line and ground results in current draw out from the capacitor to the circuit and when capacitance C is large enough, sufficient current is supplied with acceptable range of voltage drop. To reduce the effective series inductance, small and large capacitors are usually placed in parallel; many small capacitors may be adjacent to individual integrated circuits. The capacitor stores {{a small amount of}} energy that can compensate for the voltage drop in the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>conductors</b> to the capacitor.|$|R

5000|$|Active {{devices of}} an {{electronic}} system (transistors, ICs, vacuum tubes, for example) {{are connected to}} their <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> through <b>conductors</b> with finite resistance and inductance. If the current drawn by an active device changes, voltage drops from <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> to device will also change due to these impedances. If several active devices share a common path to the <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> changes in the current drawn by one element may produce voltage changes large enough to affect the operation of others - voltage spikes or ground bounce, for example - so the change of state of one device is coupled to others through the common impedance to the <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> A decoupling capacitor provides a bypass path for transient currents, instead of flowing through the common impedance.|$|R
40|$|For many {{electromagnetic}} devices, {{the field}} coils {{may be considered}} as being stranded, i. e. we may neglect the surface effect.

50|$|In a {{symmetric}} three-phase <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> system, three <b>conductors</b> each {{carry an}} alternating current {{of the same}} frequency and voltage amplitude relative to a common reference but with a phase difference of one third the period. The common reference is usually connected to ground and often to a current-carrying conductor called the neutral. Due to the phase difference, the voltage on any conductor reaches its peak at one third of a cycle {{after one of the}} other conductors and one third of a cycle before the remaining conductor. This phase delay gives constant power transfer to a balanced linear load. It also makes it possible to produce a rotating magnetic field in an electric motor and generate other phase arrangements using transformers (for instance, a two phase system using a Scott-T transformer).|$|R

40|$|Objectives To commemorate {{victims of}} {{electrical}} accidents {{that occurred in}} the first decades of radiology and relate these accidents to the evolution of the X-ray apparatus. Methods Digitised newspapers, scientific journals, books and reports of legal procedures were searched for electrical accidents involving X-ray systems. Information on the his-torical systems was retrieved from the scientific literature and brochures from manufacturers. Results We found 51 fatal and 62 non-fatal but serious elec-trical accidents. Most of them occurred between 1920 and 1940 and involved transformers that provided output currents well above the threshold for the induction of ventricular fibrillation. The accidents led to recommendations and regu-lations to improve safety for operators and patients, and spurred manufacturers to technical developments that culmi-nated in fully electrically shockproof systems by 1935. Conclusions Although largely forgotten, the development of the shockproof X-ray systems we take for granted today lasted about 4 decades and was associated with considerable human suffering. The complete solution of the problem is a success story of engineering realised by contributions from all parties involved. Main messages • The development of electrically shockproof X-ray systems took about 4 decades (1895 – 1935). • Between 1896 and 1920 electrical shocks from X-ray systems were common, but their consequences limited. • After 1920, transformers killed by delivering currents above the ventricular fibrillation threshold. • Inductors, static generators and high-frequency coils were generally low-current systems and safe. • We found 51 fatal and 62 serious non-fatal electrical accidents, most occurring from 1920 to 1940.

50|$|A {{switched-mode}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (switching-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switch-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switched <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> SMPS, or switcher) is {{an electronic}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently. Like other <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source (often mains power) to DC loads, {{such as a}} personal computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. Ideally, a switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> dissipates no <b>power.</b> Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time. In contrast, a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor. This higher power conversion efficiency is an important advantage of a switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> Switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> may also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply due to the smaller transformer size and weight.|$|R
