Previous work on iron oxide semiconductors indicated stability to photoanodic corrosion and a band gap (m 2 eV) that holds the poten-tial for utilizing a significant fraction of the incident solar spectrum. Fabrication has proved simpler than with other semiconductors. The electronic transition on ~-F ~ 03 is indirect (6). A variety of approaches have been evaluated by others to enhance the photo-electrochemical properties of metal oxide semiconductors, including modification of the flat-band potential by selecting photoanode materials with reduced electron affinities, which results in improved zero bias operation (ii). Even more enhanced performance can, in principle, be achieved by improving the spectral response by doping {{while at the same time}} maintaining its zero bias characteristics (12); however, results to date have not un-equivocally demonstrated this in practice. Photocurrents have also been increased by formation of mixed surface oxides, such as AI 203 on TiO 2 and SrO on T i ~ (13), where it has been speculated to be a consequence of enhanced surface electronic conductivity.

Photochemical derivatisation and subsequent electrochemical detection {{have been carried out}} using the photoelectrochemical (PEC) approach in which photolysis of the analyte and detection of the photoproduct take place within the detector cell. Three modes of irradiation that differ in the position of the irradiation point with respect to the position of the working electrode are described. Implementation of these irradiation modes has been achieved by designing PEC flow cells employing either the thin-layer or the wall-jet geometry. Electrochemical and PEC parameters describing the analytical performance and efficiency of the PEC cells have been evaluated. A method for determining the amount of light absorbed inside PEC cells has been developed. In one irradiation mode the light is introduced into the cell through an optically transparent working electrode, a number of which have been characterised. Irradiation of the electrode surface has been shown to produce background photocurrents resulting from surface <b>photoeffects.</b> To minimise these effects, a detection technique utilising pulsed irradiation and current sampling techniques has been investigated. Enhancement of detection of some analytes has been achieved by use of chemically modified electrodes with electrocatalytic properties.

Surface area was reduced after metal impregnation. Impregnated metals existed mainly as metal carbonates and carboxylates. Activated carbons showed strong hydrophobic interactions. Modification (selective etching and introduction of some new functional groups) of activated carbon surfaces was done with c-HNO 3 (c = concentrated). ^ Manganese oxide films were prepared by sol-gel methods (spin, dip, and spatula coatings) and by physical vapor deposition (PVD) followed by thermal oxidation. Crystallinity, surface morphology, and chemical composition were dependent upon preparation methods. The thinnest films were made by spin coating. More crystalline and even films were obtained by spatula coating. Manganese oxide films made by PVD thermal oxidation showed <b>photoeffects</b> under different radiation and sensing behavior towards CHCl 3. ^ Tin oxide thin films were prepared by PVD thermal oxidation and spray pyrolysis. Surface morphology and crystallinity depend on preparation methods. Thermal oxidation conditions control {{the properties of the}} films such as film conductivity, crystallinity, and transmittance. Auger electron spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to determine O/Sn ratios on the surfaces of the films. Tin oxide films made by spray pyrolysis and PVD thermal oxidation with temperature programming showed good sensing behavior towards CH 2 Cl 2. ^ Thermally oxidized tin oxide thin films with temperature programming were used for the detection of chlorinated methanes (CH 2 Cl 2, CHCl 3, and CCl 4). The films showed the best sensing behavior at 300 ∘C. The films showed different sensing behavior to different gases. The films were chemically selective to chlorinated methanes and stable for more than three weeks at operating temperature. The films showed fast gas sensing (3 ̆c 40 sec) and low detection limits (3 ̆c 4 ppm CCl 4). Surface available oxygen is critical for gas sensing. The detection mechanism of CH 2 Cl 2 and CHCl 3 seem to be different from that with CCl 4. Some of the detected products were CO 2 and chloride anion. ...|$|R
