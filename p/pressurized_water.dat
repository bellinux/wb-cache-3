5|$|Ikata is {{the site}} of Shikoku's only nuclear power plant. The Ikata Nuclear Power Plant has two Mitsubishi 538 MWe <b>Pressurized</b> <b>Water</b> Reactor units with the Two Reactor Coolant Loop design (similar to the {{original}} Westinghouse design at Prairie Island, Kewaunee, and Point Beach plants) and one Mitsubishi <b>Pressurized</b> <b>Water</b> Reactor unit with the Three Reactor Coolant Loop design (similar to the Westinghouse Surry, North Anna, and Robinson plants). Units 1 and 2 started up on September 30, 1977 and March 19, 1981 respectively. Unit 3 is a three loop PWR rated at 846 MWe that started up on December 15, 1994.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{success of}} the <b>pressurized</b> <b>water</b> reactor, he wrote, was due less to any superior characteristics of water, but rather to the decision to power the prototype of the Mark I submarine thermal reactor with a pressurized version of the Materials Testing Reactor at Oak Ridge. Once <b>pressurized</b> <b>water</b> was established, other possibilities became too expensive to pursue, but Weinberg remained interested in other possibilities. According to Freeman Dyson, {{he was the only}} nuclear pioneer who supported the wide universe of reactor designs.|$|E

5000|$|... "Hydro Power" [...] {{is a term}} {{coined by}} Buzz Bee Toys Inc., {{referring}} initially to their series of water guns that employed an elastic rubber bladder to <b>pressurize</b> <b>water.</b> Akin to the CPS system, the rubber diaphragm system can be considered basically half of a CPS-pressure chamber. A sheet of elastic material (typically rubber) is clamped against a housing unit. Water is pumped into the chamber, expanding the bladder that <b>pressurizes</b> the <b>water</b> within. However, due {{to the shape of}} the bladder, its expansion is not as uniform as in the CPS system, thus it experiences more significant pressure dropoff as the pressure chamber empties.|$|R

5|$|Zinc oxide {{depleted}} in 64Zn (the zinc isotope with {{atomic mass}} 64) {{is used in}} corrosion prevention in nuclear <b>pressurized</b> <b>water</b> reactors. The depletion is necessary, because 64Zn is transformed into radioactive 65Zn under irradiation by the reactor neutrons.|$|E
5|$|In nuclear reactors, 10B is {{used for}} {{reactivity}} control and in emergency shutdown systems. It can serve either function {{in the form of}} borosilicate control rods or as boric acid. In <b>pressurized</b> <b>water</b> reactors, boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling. It is then slowly filtered out over many months as fissile material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive.|$|E
5|$|The Three Mile Island {{power station}} is near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in the United States. The {{accident}} described in Three Mile Island began on Wednesday, March 28, 1979, and ultimately {{resulted in a}} partial core meltdown in Unit 2 of the nuclear power plant. Unit 2's <b>pressurized</b> <b>water</b> reactor was of 900 MWe capacity. The scope and complexity of this reactor accident became clear {{over the course of}} five days, as a number of agencies at the local, state and federal levels tried to solve the problem and decide whether the ongoing accident required an emergency evacuation, and to what extent.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} Argonne National Laboratory in 1956, Zinn moved to Florida, where he founded his own {{consulting}} firm, General Nuclear Engineering, with {{its headquarters in}} Dunedin, Florida. The company {{was involved in the}} design and construction of <b>pressurized</b> <b>water</b> reactors. It was acquired by Combustion Engineering in 1964, and he became a vice president and head of its nuclear division. He stepped down from this position in 1970, but remained a board member until 1986. He served {{as a member of the}} President's Science Advisory Committee from 1960 to 1962, and a member of the General Advisory Committee of the AEC and its successor, the Energy Research and Development Administration, from 1972 to 1975.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Weinberg coauthored {{the first}} nuclear reactor textbook, The Physical Theory of Neutron Chain Reactors, with Wigner. The {{following}} year, 1959, {{he was elected}} president of the American Nuclear Society and, in 1960, began service on the President's Science Advisory Committee under the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations. Starting in 1945 with Patent #2,736,696, Weinberg, usually with Wigner, filed numerous patents on the light water reactor (LWR) technology that has provided the United States' primary nuclear reactors. The main LWR types are <b>Pressurized</b> <b>Water</b> Reactors (PWRs) and Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs), that serve in Naval propulsion and commercial nuclear power. In 1965 he was appointed vice president of Union Carbide's Nuclear Division.|$|E
5|$|The nuclei {{of several}} hafnium {{isotopes}} can each absorb multiple neutrons. This makes hafnium a good material {{for use in}} the control rods for nuclear reactors. Its neutron-capture cross-section is about 600 times that of zirconium. (Other elements that are good neutron-absorbers for control rods are cadmium and boron.) Excellent mechanical properties and exceptional corrosion-resistance properties allow its use in the harsh environment of <b>pressurized</b> <b>water</b> reactors. The German research reactor FRM II uses hafnium as a neutron absorber. It is also common in military reactors, particularity in US naval reactors, but seldom found in civilian ones, the first core of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station (a conversion of a naval reactor) being a notable exception.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the solvent based {{extraction}} of artemisinin from Artemisia annua L. using acetone in percolation mode {{is compared to}} the method of <b>pressurized</b> hot <b>water</b> extraction. Both techniques are simulated by a physico-chemical process model. The model {{as well as the}} model parameter determination, including the thermal degradation of artemisinin are shown and discussed. For the conventional extraction, a solvent screening is performed considering various organic solvents. A temperature screening is presented for the systematic design of the <b>pressurized</b> hot <b>water</b> extraction. The best temperature with regards to thermal decomposition and high productivity was found to be 80 °C. Both, conventional percolation and <b>Pressurized</b> Hot <b>Water</b> Extraction (PHWE) are suitable for the {{extraction of}} artemisinin.

5|$|This {{exothermic}} reaction is very slow below 100°C, but at temperature above 900°C {{the reaction is}} rapid. Most metals undergo similar reactions. The redox reaction is relevant to the instability of fuel assemblies at high temperatures. This reaction was responsible for a small hydrogen explosion first observed inside the reactor building of Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 1979, but at that time, the containment building was not damaged. The same reaction occurred in the reactors 1, 2 and 3 of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant (Japan) after the reactor cooling was interrupted by the earthquake and tsunami disaster of March 11, 2011 leading to the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. After venting the hydrogen in the maintenance hall of those three reactors, the mixture of hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen exploded, severely damaging the installations {{and at least one}} of the containment buildings. To avoid explosion, the direct venting of hydrogen to the open atmosphere would have been a preferred design option. Now, to prevent the risk of explosion in many <b>pressurized</b> <b>water</b> reactor (PWR) containment buildings, a catalyst-based recombinator is installed that converts hydrogen and oxygen into water at room temperature before the hazard arises.|$|E

50|$|District heating or {{teleheating}} systems {{consist of}} a network of insulated feed and return pipes which transport heated <b>water,</b> <b>pressurized</b> hot <b>water</b> or sometimes steam to the customer. While steam is hottest and may be used in industrial processes due to its higher temperature, it is less efficient to produce and transport due to greater heat losses. Heat transfer oils are generally not used for economic and ecological reasons. The typical annual loss of thermal energy through distribution is around 10%, as seen in Norway's district heating network.|$|R
50|$|Banded archerfish have mouths {{adapted to}} spit jets of water over distance, usually to knock prey into the water. The banded archerfish shoots the {{jet of water}} by raising its tongue against the roof of its mouth, forming a tube. The opercula then close quickly, <b>pressurizing</b> <b>water</b> along the tube. Most archerfish are able to spit at a range of 150 cm, though some larger {{specimens}} may be capable of ranges of up to 2 to 3 m.
