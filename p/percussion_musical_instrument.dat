50|$|Drums and Talas are {{mentioned}} in the Vedic era texts. A <b>percussion</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> {{with two or three}} small drums, held with strings, called Pushkara (also spelled Pushkala) were in existence in pre-5th century Indian subcontinent along with other drums such as the Mridang, but these are not called tabla then. The pre-5th century paintings in the Ajanta Caves, for example, show a group of musicians playing small tabla-like upright seated drums, a kettle-shaped mridang drum and cymbals. Similar artwork with seated musicians playing drums, but carved in stone, are found in the Ellora Caves, and others.|$|E

The name itself means [...] "three slabs" [...] or [...] "three boards/planks," [...] and it {{consists}} of three shards ebony or other woods that are bound together by twine. It produces a variety of clicking sounds {{similar to that of}} castanets. It is played by placing the shards between the fingers of one hand, while using the other hand to flick the pieces of wood together. It can be played in slow or fast rhythms, depending on the musical genre. It is often heard in Okinawan folk music.|$|E
50|$|Patrol {{started from}} Jember people's habits {{in the past}} when they liked to keep pigeons. From that habit, some people became {{accustomed}} to <b>percussion</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instruments.</b> At first, it was only used for a method to call pigeons. When people who kept pigeons increased, these <b>percussion</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> developed into a distinct rhythm. As time ent by, Patrol developed to become a folk music and became a communication device. Then, Patrol also developed as the music of the plantation guards. Patrol developed further during the holy month of Ramadan to awaken the citizens at meal time (sahur), because the majority of citizens of Jember are Muslims.|$|R

It served as an accompaniment to Czech folk songs, and one popular new year's tune is named after the instrument.|$|E
40|$|Street Theatre in India, {{referred}} to as the ‘Third Theatre’ as a form of social and cultural communication, is deeply rooted in the Indian tradition. Many complex social issues be it gender related, child labor, imparting knowledge about HIV and AIDS, the need to educate a girl child, social and political systems, dynastic politics, are all enacted through the genre of ‘street plays’. There is a ‘stage discussion’ through varying perspectives of a number of characters, bringing an ‘immediacy and urgency’ to the theme under consideration. It is a situation, where the audience has not come prepared to watch a play, may not have time on hand, hence the impact of a ‘street play’ is direct, close, intimate and effective. The impact is ‘immediate’. A ‘convince-convert’ strategy is employed accompanied by a ‘Dholak’ (Indian <b>percussion</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument)</b> or a ‘choir’ to attract the crowd at the cross roads or any street corner...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of note recognition for Thai xylophones. Thai xylophone is a <b>percussion</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> which can be played monophonically and polyphonically. A set of 21 digital bandpass filters are used to determines energy. An energy compensation technique is applied to normalize the loundness of the energy of each note. This paper uses an artificial neuron network {{to determine if the}} sound is monophonic (one note) or polyphonic (two notes). The output from the neuron networks specifies the number of highest energy notes (1 or 2) that must be selected for actual notes from the sound. The recognition accuracy obtained is 98. 24 %. The duration of each note is determined from the sound waveform. The output notes and durations are presented in a MIDI file. The algorithms are implemented in Matlab – as an application program. The user can record sounds, play sounds, and convert the recorded sounds to notes. The program also allows the user to set the threshold value and design a new set of filters that suitable for other xylophones...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well-known}} that an impulse-excited, all-pole filter {{is capable of}} representing many physical phenomena, including the oscillatory modes of <b>percussion</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> like woodblocks, xylophones, or chimes. In contrast to the more common application of all-pole models to speech, however, practical problems arise in music synthesis due {{to the location of}} poles very close to the unit circle. The objective of this work was to develop algorithms to find excitation and filter parameters for synthesis of percussion instrument sounds using only an inexpensive all-pole filter chip (TI TSP 50 C 1 x). The paper describes analysis methods for dealing with pole locations near the unit circle, as well as a general method for modeling the transient attack characteristics of a particular sound while independently controlling the amplitudes of each oscillatory mode...|$|R
40|$|Sound is an inseparable part {{of human}} life and {{provides}} us with lovely experiences such as listening to music. Musicians from classical orchestras to rock groups are exposed to high decibel of sounds. Musicians playing <b>percussion</b> <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> are exposed to high level of impact noise and players of Brass <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> are highly exposed to noise peaks higher than 100 dB. Woodwind players are enduring the risk of posing {{directly in front of}} Brass players. Based on the above-mentioned risks for hearing loss clinical consideration of noise induced hearing loss in musicians is highly required. In the current study we were aimed at examining hearing stratus of classic and traditional musicians by means of pure tone audiometry in Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting. 33 subjects were evaluated aged between 22 to 59 years old. Their musical experience was variable between 6 to 45 years.

500|$|Malagasy {{music is}} highly melodic and distinguishes itself from many traditions of {{mainland}} Africa by {{the predominance of}} chordophone relative to <b>percussion</b> <b>instruments.</b> <b>Musical</b> <b>instruments</b> and vocal styles found in Madagascar represent a blend of widespread commonalities and highly localized traditions. [...] A common vocal style among the Merina and Betsileo of the Highlands, for instance, does not preclude differences in the prevalence of particular instrument types (the valiha among the Merina, and the marovany and kabosy among the Betsileo). [...] Similarly, the practice of tromba (entering a trance state, typically induced by music) is present on both the western and eastern coasts of the island but the vocal styles or instruments used in the ceremony will vary regionally. [...] Music in Madagascar tends toward major keys and diatonic scales, although coastal music makes frequent use of minor keys, most likely due to early Arab influences at coastal ports of call.

Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a drum stick, to produce sound. There is usually a resonance head on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead.

Much of the military music has been composed to announce military events as with bugle calls and fanfares, or accompany marching formations with drum cadences, or mark special occasions as by military bands. However, music has been employed in battle for centuries, sometimes to intimidate the enemy and other times to encourage combatants, or to assist in organization and timing of actions in warfare. Depending on the culture, a variety of <b>percussion</b> and <b>musical</b> <b>instruments</b> have been used, such as drums, fifes, bugles, trumpets or other horns, bagpipes, triangles, cymbals, as well as larger military bands or full orchestras. Although some martial music has been composed in written form, other music has been developed or taught by ear, such as bugle calls or drum cadences, relying on group memory to coordinate the sounds.|$|R
