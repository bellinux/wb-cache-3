25|$|Several {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the floating chargee, prior to crystallisation, may have no <b>proprietary</b> <b>interest</b> at all in the charged assets. However, this is inconsistent with cases (such as Spectrum) at the highest level which suggest a <b>proprietary</b> <b>interest</b> does exist.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, the {{floating}} chargee {{may have an}} inchoate type of <b>proprietary</b> <b>interest,</b> with characteristics that are proprietary but of a lesser order than the <b>proprietary</b> <b>interest</b> of a chargee with a fixed charge. Some authors have suggested {{that there is an}} interest in a fund of assets, but the nature and incidents of the interest remain unclear. This has received some judicial support, from Lord Walker in Spectrum, for example.|$|E

25|$|A {{person who}} accepts the {{possession}} of personal property from one not authorized to transfer it may {{be regarded as a}} converter. The Restatement (Second) of Torts is in accord with this concept, stating that one who receives possession of a chattel from another with the intent to acquire for himself or a third person a <b>proprietary</b> <b>interest</b> in the chattel which the other has not the power to transfer is subject to liability for conversion to a third person then entitled to the immediate possession of the chattel.|$|E
25|$|One form of imputed bias {{is based}} on the {{decision-maker}} being a party to a suit, or having a pecuniary or <b>proprietary</b> <b>interest</b> in the outcome of the decision. Once this fact has been established, the bias is irrebuttable and disqualification is automatic – the decision-maker will be barred from adjudicating the matter without the need for any investigation into the likelihood or suspicion of bias. A classic case is Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal Proprietors (1852), which involved an action between Dimes, a local landowner, and the proprietors of the Grand Junction Canal, in which the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cottenham, had affirmed decrees made to the proprietors. However, it was discovered by Dimes that Lord Cottenham in fact owned several pounds worth of shares in the Grand Junction Canal. This eventually led to the judge being disqualified from deciding the case. There was no inquiry as to whether a reasonable person would consider Lord Cottenham to be biased, or as to the circumstances which led Lord Cottenham to hear the case.|$|E

2500|$|In {{answering}} {{the central question}} {{of what constitutes a}} pecuniary or <b>proprietary</b> <b>interest,</b> the trend over time has been towards a raising of the degree of the interest that will disqualify adjudicators. In the 19th century it was held that [...] "any direct pecuniary interest, however small" [...] would result in a disqualification for bias. By 1999, the courts had come to apply a de minimis exception to the degree of pecuniary interest required. Nonetheless, [...] "any doubt should be resolved in favour of disqualification".|$|E
2500|$|A pecuniary or <b>proprietary</b> <b>interest</b> {{can arise}} in two ways. First, the {{decision-maker}} {{may have an}} interest of this nature {{in one of the}} parties involved in a matter. Secondly, the decision-maker may have a pecuniary or <b>proprietary</b> <b>interest</b> in the outcome of the decision placed before him or her. The two situations are not mutually exclusive – in a 1999 decision, the Court of Appeal of Victoria held {{that it is not a}} judge's mere shareholding in a party [...] "but rather it is the potential interest, created by that shareholding, in the subject matter or outcome of the litigation which is the disqualifying factor". A seminal case in this respect is Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal Proprietors (1852). In that case the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cottenham, was found to have an interest as a shareholder in a company which was a party to a suit presented to him. As this fact was discovered after his Lordship had heard the suit, he was disqualified on the ground of his interest and the decree he issued was held to be voidable. The House of Lords said that it is [...] "a settled principle of constitutional law that a man cannot be judge in his own cause". In Alkaff, the Straits Settlements Court of Appeal recognized that a financial interest may affect a person with bias.|$|E
2500|$|The {{courts have}} {{extended}} {{the category of}} imputed bias to situations where adjudicators have interests in decisions that are personal but neither pecuniary nor proprietary. A well-known example is the UK case R. v. Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No. 2) (1999). Amnesty International was {{a party to the}} case, and the House of Lords held that Lord Hoffmann, being a chairman of a subsidiary of Amnesty, ought to have been automatically disqualified from hearing the case. This was despite his Lordship having neither a pecuniary nor <b>proprietary</b> <b>interest</b> in the outcome of the case. It observed: ...|$|E
50|$|While {{statutory}} licences {{have sometimes}} been equated with <b>proprietary</b> <b>interests,</b> {{the removal of}} rights enjoyed under a statutory licence does not typically constitute an acquisition of property within section 51(xxxi), as licence conditions are inherently susceptible to change.|$|R

30|$|In {{privately funded}} {{research}} initiatives {{which are not}} governed by international guidelines, and in instances where recommended IP-related clauses in a data sharing or consortium agreement are absent, data derived from consortia-wide efforts should be considered the <b>proprietary</b> <b>interests</b> of the consortium as a whole.|$|R
2500|$|In {{considering}} whether a pecuniary or <b>proprietary</b> <b>interest</b> exists, it is irrelevant whether the decision-maker was actually biased or not when exercising {{his or her}} powers. Though it may be practically possible to exercise impartiality in such a situation, it is the appearance of justice {{that lies at the}} root of this principle of natural justice. In Dimes, certiorari was granted to quash Lord Cottenham's decree due to his pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case even though, as Lord Campbell stated, [...] "o one can suppose that Lord Cottenham could be, in the remotest degree, influenced by the interest that he had in this concern". Similarly, in the Alkaff case Acting Chief Justice Terrell noted that the rule against bias applied even though, quoting the trial judge, [...] " [...] was in fact completely unbiased. He conducted his inquiry in each case methodically and exhaustively and with the most fairness and impartiality".|$|E
2500|$|.....I was {{interested}} in how free culture and open-source licensing strategies could help improve access and participation in the creative content I inherited from my ancestors in just that age {{when it was all}} transitioning from an analog print format to a searchable digital one.

2500|$|Constructive trusts {{arise in}} a number of {{situations}} that are generally classified as [...] "wrongs", {{in the sense that they}} mirror a breach of duty by a trustee, by someone who owes fiduciary obligations, or anyone. In a seventh group of constructive trust cases (which also seems uncontroversial), a person who murders their wife or husband cannot inherit their property, and are said by the courts to hold any property on constructive trust for another next of kin. Eighth, it was held in Attorney General v Guardian Newspapers Ltd that information, or intellectual property, taken in breach of confidence would be held on constructive trust. Ninth, a trustee or another person in a fiduciary position, who breaches a duty and makes a profit out of it, has been held to hold all profits on constructive trust. For instance in Boardman v Phipps, a solicitor for a family trust and one of the trust's beneficiaries, took the opportunity to invest in a company in Australia, partly on the trust's behalf, but also making a profit themselves. They both stood in a [...] "fiduciary" [...] position of trust because as a solicitor, or someone managing the trust's affairs, the law requires they act solely in the trust's interest. Crucially, they failed to gain the fully informed consent of the beneficiaries to invest in the opportunity and make a profit themselves. This opened up a possibility that their interests could conflict with the interest's of the trust. So, the House of Lords held they were in breach of duty, and that all profits they made were held on constructive trust, though they could claim quantum meruit (a salary fixed by the court) for the work they did. More straightforwardly, in Reading v Attorney-General the House of Lords held that an army sergeant (a fiduciary for the UK government) who took bribes while stationed in Egypt held his bribes on constructive trust for the Crown. However, more recently it has become more controversial to classify these constructive trusts along with wrongs on the basis that the remedies that are available should differ from (and usually go further than) compensatory damages in tort. Also, it has been doubted that a constructive trust should be imposed that would bind third parties in an insolvency situation. In Sinclair Investments (UK) Ltd v Versailles Trade Finance Ltd, Lord Neuberger MR held that company's liquidators could not claim a <b>proprietary</b> <b>interest</b> in the fraudulent profits its former director had made if this would prejudice the director's other creditors in insolvency. The effect of a constructive trust would accordingly be limited so that it did not bind third party creditors of an insolvent defendant. The United Kingdom Supreme Court, however, has subsequently overruled Sinclair in FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital Partners LLC, holding that a bribe or secret commission accepted by an agent is held on trust for his principal..|$|E

40|$|This work aims to {{make the}} case for {{recognising}} the contributions of users to MMORPGs and Virtual Worlds. These environments are software entities which are protected in England and Wales by copyright. These online environments require input from numerous sources, including users, in order to retain their user base. Users therefore interact, create and develop these spaces with both in-game items such as characters, swords and clothing, and items developed outside of these environments. However, users frequently do not receive <b>proprietary</b> <b>interests</b> in any of these game items. The current paradigm of copyright and contract provides not just the framework for the allocation of claims to in-game items and the underlying software code, but also the governance constructs in these online environments. Contractual provisions are the dominant mechanisms of control, displacing automatically arising <b>proprietary</b> <b>interests,</b> and are required before any user can access an online game or Virtual World. It is argued that the current situation whereby contractual agreements restrict user claims whilst seeking to govern every aspect of MMORPGs and Virtual Worlds does not provide a ?fair? system for users, or their interests. It is concluded that End User License Agreements (EULAs) displace user rights whilst copyright and philosophical justifications indicate strong theoretical claims in support of users. As such, these EULAs ought to be considered in light of unfair contractual terms provisions to challenge the positions they adopt. There is a need to challenge the EULAs to validate the claims of users to items in online games and Virtual Worlds. This challenge must also indicate that there ought to be an appropriate governance system reflecting a balance between the interests of users and developers whilst providing a system whereby disputes between users, and over <b>proprietary</b> <b>interests</b> can be settled...|$|R
