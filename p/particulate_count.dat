40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedEighty-six oceanographic stations were occupied {{in the waters}} between Monterey Bay and San Francisco Bay during the period 7 - 14 November 1969. Values of beam transmittance, oxygen content, <b>particulate</b> <b>count,</b> and temperature {{were obtained from the}} surface to 100 meters. These parameters were analyzed and compared by means of depth profiles, horizontal contours and vertical contours. The average sea surface temperature during this period was 14. 44 degrees C. The northern part of Monterey Bay had the lowest values of beam transmittance and highest values of <b>particulate</b> <b>count.</b> The California Current appears to be flowing southward down the coast at depths above 60 meters and entering Monterey Bay where it sinks to a depth of at least 61 meters. Indications of downwelling are present off the coast between Pt. Ano Nuevo andSanta Cruz and this is attributed to the northward flowing Davidson Current impinging on the shore and sinking. A layer of maximum <b>particulate</b> <b>count</b> was often found to exist within the thermocline. A fairly good correlation seems to exist between beam transmittance and oxygen content were apparent. Approximately 74 percent of all particulates observed by a Coulter Counter having a- 100 micron orifice were less than 6. 2 microns in diameter. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT-An air {{pollution}} episode during August 1970 over the central United States is examined. By use of surface visibilities and an 850 -mb wind trajectory analysis, we observed the pollution to advance as much as 700 mi from the central midwest (source region) into the upper midwest and Great Plains (impact area). A large, nearly stationary high-pressure system over the source region allowed the pollution to accumulate beneath a mid-level subsidence inversion located generally near 700 mb. Southeasterly flow around the backside of the High and the northeasterly flow around a weak Low to the south advected the pollution into the impact area. At times, surface visibilities {{in parts of the}} impact area were restricted by haze to as little as 4 mi. Although <b>particulate</b> <b>count</b> data were meager, several stations recordcd their highest <b>particulate</b> <b>count</b> of the year during the episode. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} {{generate}} further characterisation {{data for the}} lyophilised product Erwinia chrysanthemi L-asparaginase, reconstituted drug product (DP; marketed as Erwinase or Erwinaze) was analysed for subvisible (2 – 10 μm) particulate content using both the light obscuration (LO) method and the newer flow-imaging microscopy (FIM) technique. No correlation of subvisible <b>particulate</b> <b>counts</b> exists between FIM and LO nor do the counts correlate with activity at both release and on stability. The subvisible particulate content of lyophilised Erwinia L-asparaginase appears to be consistent and stable over time and in line with other parenteral biopharmaceutical products. The majority (ca. 75 %) of subvisible particulates in L-asparaginase DP were {{at the low end}} of the measurement range by FIM (2 – 4 μm). In this size range, FIM was unable to definitively classify the particulates as either protein or non-protein. More sensitive measurement techniques would be needed to classify the particulates in lyophilised L-asparaginase into type (protein and non-protein), so the LO technique has been chosen for on-going DP analyses. E. chrysanthemi L-asparaginase has a lower rate of hypersensitivity compared with native Escherichia coli preparations, but a subset of patients develop hypersensitivity to the Erwinia enzyme. A DP lot that had subvisible <b>particulate</b> <b>counts</b> on the upper end of the measurement range by both LO and FIM had the same incidence of allergic hypersensitivity in clinical experience as lots at all levels of observed subvisible particulate content, suggesting that the presence of L-asparaginase subvisible particulates is not important with respect to allergic response.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA detailed oceanographic {{survey of the}} coastal waters between Monterey Bay and San Francisco Bay, California, was conducted from 10 through 18 May 1969. Measurements of beam transmittance, sound velocity, temperature, and <b>particulate</b> <b>count</b> were obtained. Over 500 water samples were taken for particulate analysis. The optical properties of this region {{were found to be}} very complex. The waters appeared to be affected by flow from San Francisco Bay, littoral material, upwelling, and possibly sewage outfalls during the survey. A greater volume of water with low transmissivity and high particle count existed in the northern region of the survey area than in the southern region. An eddy system between Monterey Bay and Point Ano Nuevo was suggested. Approximately 90 percent of the particles affecting beam transmittance were less than 12 y in diameter. Particle sizes were found to decrease with increased depths. A fairly good correlation of beam transmittance with particle count was observed except in near shore areas.

40|$|Injecting {{drug users}} {{are at risk}} of and can suffer from serious health {{problems}} due to intravenous administration of insoluble particles from street drugs and tablets. Makeshift filters are used to try to remove particles from the injections. The decision to distribute filters from Harm Reduction Centres cannot be based on evidence of efficacy and safety as no such published data exists. The work presented here {{is part of a larger}} study which anticipates to provide such evidence. Laboratory methods were developed based on information gathered from drug users. Injections were prepared using drugs of abuse and filtered either through makeshift or commercially available filters. The resulting solutions were assayed for particle size and number (using Coulter Counter®). Comparisons were made with unfiltered injections. The results presented here are from the first part of this study, which investigated the effectiveness of various filters on reducing <b>particulate</b> <b>count</b> and size range of injections made from tablets. The commercially produced filter (Acrodisk®) showed a much greater reduction in particle number and size. This strongly suggests the risks to health could be reduced by the use of such filters. Of the makeshift filters, the Rizla® acetate filter showed the most satisfactory reduction in the number of particles, suggesting their use may be preferable to the currently popular cigarette filter. The ongoing work is looking at the effect of the filtration methods on amount of drug in injections made from tablets and repeating the work using street heroin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The city of Phnom Penh is {{experiencing}} growth and, with this growth, an increased level {{of air pollution}} {{in the form of}} airborne particles that are attributed to increased vehicle traffic in the city – vehicular exhaust and re-entrained dust. For this study, airborne <b>particulates</b> were <b>counted</b> and sorted using a six-channel laser particle counter. Initial sample counts were taken at 88 sites within the city of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on days representative of dry season conditions. A subset of 33 sites was re-sampled on a day representative of the wet season. Objectives of this study are to provide a baseline <b>count</b> for airborne <b>particulates</b> in the city of Phnom Penh, and to explore the characteristics of the <b>particulate</b> <b>counts</b> utilizing summary statistics and maps. The median Phnom Penh city-wide fine and coarse particle counts are 1. 07 * 108 /m 3 and 1. 36 * 106 /m 3, respectively. While the fine particle count can be attributed to vehicle exhaust, the coarse particle count is attributed to re-entrained road dust and dirt roads. The overall coarse particle count is influenced by a number of hot spots across the city. Selective paving of these hot spots will greatly reduce the level of airborne coarse particulates.

40|$|The NASA White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) has {{developed}} an entirely aqueous final cleaning and verification process to replace the current chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) 113 based process. This process has been accepted for final cleaning and cleanliness verification of WSTF ground support equipment. The aqueous process relies on ultrapure water at 50 C (323 K) and ultrasonic agitation for removal of organic compounds and particulate. The cleanliness is verified bv determining the total organic carbon (TOC) content and filtration with <b>particulate</b> <b>counting.</b> The effectiveness of the aqueous methods for detecting hydrocarbon contamination and particulate was compared to the accepted CFC 113 sampling procedures. Testing with known contaminants, such as hydraulic fluid and cutting and lubricating oils, to establish a correlation between aqueous TOC and CFC 113 nonvolatile residue (NVR) was performed. Particulate sampling on cleaned batches of hardware that were randomly separated and sampled by the two methods was performed. This paper presents the approach and results, and discusses the issues in establishing the equivalence of aqueous sampling to CFC 113 sampling, while describing the approach for implementing aqueous techniques on Space Shuttle Propulsion hardware...|$|R
40|$|Current {{guidelines}} for the location and design of bus stops do {{not take into account}} air quality or exposure considerations for waiting passengers. This paper compares the exposure of transit riders waiting at three-sided bus stop shelters that either: 1) face roadway traffic, or 2) face away from roadway traffic. Shelters were instrumented with devices to monitor particulate matter concentration inside and outside the shelter, wind speed and direction, and vehicle counts. Data were collected at three shelters during both the morning and afternoon peak periods. Bus shelter orientation is found to {{have a significant effect on}} the concentration of four sizes of particulate matter: ultrafine particles, PM 1, PM 2. 5, and PM 10. It was observed that shelters with an opening oriented towards the roadway had consistently higher concentrations inside the shelter than outside the shelter. In contrast, shelters oriented away from the roadway were observed to have lower concentrations inside the shelter than outside the shelter. Particulate concentrations are shown to vary based on both wind speed and direction. Qualitative analysis conducted on select variables suggests temperature and humidity are the dominant influencers of concentrations across all four particulate sizes. Vehicle flows can have significant correlations with ultrafine <b>particulate</b> <b>counts,</b> though not consistently. Moore et al. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Distribution of {{inorganic}} elements {{was measured}} in poultry house dust from five types of poultry houses during either winter, spring, or summer. With varied environmental condi-tions {{at the time of}} sampling, the levels of calcium, sodium, iron, zinc, magnesium, and aluminum were higher than the other elements found in dust samples from the five types of poultry houses. The most abundant element in poultry house dust was calcium. The level of this element in dust samples from the mechanically ventilated house used for research purposes corresponded closely to the level found in the feed fed at sampling time. High zinc levels in layer houses may be attributed to either the abrasive actions of feathers and feet of layers against the galvanized wire cages on the high zinc content in feathers. The ash content of dust from the five types of poultry houses ranged from. 31 to 3. 54 %. Air <b>particulate</b> <b>counts</b> for particles ranging in size from. 5 to 10 jum were much higher in the layer house used for commercial purposes (ranged from 34. 9 to 66. 3 X 106 /m 3) than in the layer houses used for research purposes (ranged from 5. 8 to 9. 8 X 106 /m 3). During winter, air particulate levels in the layer house used for commercial purposes were lower (34. 9 X 106 /m 3) than the level during summer (66. 3 X 106 /m 3).

40|$|The mixture {{preparation}} {{process in}} a Direct Injection Spark Ignition (DISI) engine has a strong influence on the processes that follow it, including combustion {{and the formation of}} pollutant emissions. The formation of particulate matter during DISI engine combustion is a complex phenomenon that has proven difficult to predict. Vehicle tailpipe emissions are subject to increasingly stringent particulate matter emissions worldwide; in Europe, particulate number emission limits came into force in 2014 and these will become an order of magnitude stricter in 2017. The choice of injection strategy can {{play an important role in}} reducing the source of these emissions during combustion, which are chiefly caused by rich mixture combustion. This in turn occurs due to mixture inhomogeneity and combustion around liquid films and liquid droplets. This thesis outlines work undertaken to improve understanding of gasoline mixture preparation processes, simulation of droplet evaporation, flash boiling, spray evaporation and spray penetration, and experimental investigation of fuel sprays in an optical spray chamber and an optical engine. Assessments of the suitability of different sub-models for spray simulation were needed, in order to capture enough of the spray physics and fuel behaviour to aid correct prediction of spray evaporation, mixture homogeneity and fuel impingement by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) packages. Phenomena have been explored on the individual droplet scale, including non-ideal behaviour of fuel mixtures, models for droplet heating/cooling during spray evaporation, the behaviour of superheated droplets under flash boiling conditions and multi-component fuel evaporation formulations. Detailed droplet evaporation routines have been created in MATLAB and single droplet studies performed under a range of conditions encountered in a DISI engine cylinder. From these results, recommendations have been made regarding the required complexity of droplet models for accurate predictions, at various fuel injection conditions. It was found necessary to model the non-ideal vapour-liquid equilibrium of ethanol-containing model gasoline fuels, for ethanol content of 10 % by volume and above, and to include models for a non-uniform droplet temperature model across most fuels and in-cylinder conditions studied. In addition, the effect of finite liquid species mixing in the fuel droplet was deemed to be important to consider for non-ideal fuel mixtures. Sub-models for droplet evaporation, incorporating non-ideal fuel behaviour, have been created for an OpenFOAM Lagrangian Particle Tracking spray CFD solver. Results from these runs confirm that trends observed at a single droplet level are typically apparent at the spray scale. It was then possible to predict the effects that different evaporation modelling approaches had on spray penetration, which is important when assessing the extent of fuel spray impingement. Including a model for the non-uniform temperature distribution inside the droplet (finite thermal conductivity) was found not to influence the overall spray behaviour as much as expected, due to the competing effects of droplet break-up, droplet collisions and gas phase cooling. Numerical predictions have been compared with findings from spray imaging investigations in a purpose-built continuous flow, atmospheric pressure spray chamber, and with findings from optical engine experiments. In addition, adiabatic flash calculations have been performed to predict the degree of flash evaporation expected under flash boiling conditions, to help to interpret the results from flash boiling spray experiments. Various images from fuel spray experiments that represent different engine conditions have been taken and analysed for axial penetration, fuel impingement, structure and evaporation rate. These have helped to understand how a certain spray might lead to conditions where increased particulate emissions are likely. The fuels used during these tests were model gasoline fuels, containing 15 % methanol by volume. This type of mixture represented fuel commercially available in some markets and was chosen to investigate the effects of a highly non-ideal and volatile fuel under both superheated and sub-cooled spray conditions. It was found that, as the degree of superheat was increased, the spray collapse tended to intensify, leading eventually to increased liquid penetration, a greater degree of spray impingement and a stratification of fuel towards the cylinder centre. Optical engine experiments have been performed using an early injection strategy for homogeneous operation, at 0. 5 bar inlet plenum pressure, for various fuel temperatures and injection timings. Particulate number measurements were taken from the exhaust, and were found to be highest when the fuel was hottest and at typical early injection timings. Retarding or advancing the injection was found to reduce the <b>particulate</b> number <b>count.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Within the microbenthic community, diatoms play an {{important}} role in terms of food source for grazers and suspension feeders. Furthermore, they contribute significantly to the primary production on intertidal flats and in coastal waters world wide. Numerous studies have now documented microalgal biomass, primary production and other aspects of their ecology in many habitats. However, knowledge on the resuspension of diatoms or the effect of hydrodynamic forces at the species level is sparse but a better understanding of processes at the sediment/water interface and of potential consequences for the ecosystem regarding climate change is urgently required. In addition, knowledge of the effect of hydrodynamics in the intertidal is important because this force links and alters various processes from small scale areas at the sediment/water interface to ecosystem as a whole. The microscopic algae inhabit the sediment and water column and a terminology exists for referring to the habitats occupied by the diatoms, including pennate and centric forms, concerning their life mode: epipsammic (attached to a substratum), epipelic (cells are associated with the sediment, mainly motile) and pelagic diatoms that will occur mainly in the water column. A variety of diatoms are frequently found in both habitats, and often described as tychopelagic: a life mode with pelagic forms that are likely to have settled from the plankton and conversely, benthic diatoms that are readily resuspended. One aim of this thesis was to investigate the diatom community in the water and on the sediment surface and to establish the life mode of selected species in order to gather background information for further studies concerning bentho-pelagic coupling. The increased resolution of the identification and cell counts revealed a discrimination at the species level. Several species, notably of the genera Diploneis and Achnanthes, were found to react to altered flow conditions by presenting enhanced cell numbers on the sediment under increased flow or reduced flow, respectively. Furthermore, Diploneis, previously assumed to be a benthic species, is now shown to adopt a tychopelagic life style. Settling processes during slack water phases and resuspension caused by wind-induced waves and tidal currents lead to a blurring of the boundaries between the two communities. The present study investigated for the first time the influence of altered flow conditions and turbulence on diatoms in situ. This enabled us to take into consideration the effects of wind direction, wind force and tidal currents on the coupling. For this purpose a three-current-flume construction was deployed modifying the flow velocity. The study was carried out on a Wadden Sea intertidal flat at Sylt island in the North Sea, Germany, on 6 dates between July and September 2003. Analyses of chlorophyll a (chl a), suspended matter (SPM), cell <b>counts,</b> <b>particulate</b> organic carbon (POC), particulate organic nitrogen (PON) and species analysis on the sediment surface and in the water column served to characterise the relationship between the two communities. Flow characteristics were measured using the Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) technique to calculate the physical parameters describing bottom shear stress and turbulence in order to assess the impact of hydrodynamics on diatom species and cell-size groups. Results showed that wind direction, Ã ?Ã Â¯Ã ?Ã Â¿Ã ?Ã Â½velocity and fetch had the greatest influence on the variability of the samples, superimposed as they were on tidal forces. An increase in flow velocity reduces turbulence, whereas under reduced flow conditions turbulence exerts stochastic resuspension events by lowering the critical bed shear stress. This affects small diatoms (< 20 Ã ?Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã ?Ã Âµm) of the benthic community that are entrained into the water column...|$|R
