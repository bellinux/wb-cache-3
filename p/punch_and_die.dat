50|$|Normally lancing {{is done on}} a {{mechanical}} press, lancing {{requires the use of}} <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> to be used. The different <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> determine the shape and angle (or curvature) of the newly made section of the material. The <b>dies</b> <b>and</b> <b>punches</b> are needed to be made of tool steel to withstand the repetitious nature of the procedure.|$|R

50|$|A die set {{consists}} {{of a set of}} <b>punches</b> (male) <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> (female) which, when pressed together, form a hole in a workpiece (and may also deform the workpiece in some desired manner). The <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> are removable, with the punch being attached to the ram during the punching process. The ram moves up and down in a vertically linear motion, forcing the punch through the material into the die.|$|R
50|$|This is a {{more complex}} tool that forms {{predetermined}} bends by clamping the workpiece between a matching <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die.</b>|$|E

50|$|If {{used as a}} punch, {{the tool}} itself {{consists}} of a punch and a matching die, into which it very closely fits. Both are usually precision machined and then hardened. The material is introduced between the <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die,</b> and the machine operated. The punch will cut through the material in one movement by shearing it. The <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> may be of any desired shape, so odd shaped holes and cutouts may be created.|$|E
50|$|The main use of {{high-speed}} steels {{continues to be}} in the manufacture of various cutting tools: drills, taps, milling cutters, tool bits, gear cutters, saw blades, planer and jointer blades, router bits, etc., although usage for <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> is increasing.|$|R

50|$|Die {{making is}} a subgenre of tool making {{that focuses on}} making <b>and</b> {{maintaining}} <b>dies.</b> This often includes making punches, dies, steel rule <b>dies,</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> sets. Precision is key in <b>die</b> making; <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> must maintain proper clearance to produce parts accurately, and it is often necessary to have die sets machined with tolerances of less than one thousandth of an inch.|$|R
50|$|When a {{component}} is produced with one single <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> where the entire outer profile is {{cut in a}} single stroke the tool is called a blanking tool.|$|E
50|$|There {{is no need}} {{to screw}} {{anything}} together. The <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> plate are adjusted to each other automatically Punches and dies can be changed rapidly meaning less machine downtime.|$|E
50|$|A {{press brake}} is a machine tool for bending {{sheet and plate}} material, most {{commonly}} sheet metal. It forms predetermined bends by clamping the workpiece between a matching <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die.</b>|$|E
40|$|A small {{hydraulic}} press for V-bending operation is designed, manufactured and modeled. The {{hydraulic bending press}} consists of hydraulic circuit, <b>punch,</b> <b>die</b> <b>and</b> PLC control unit. Automation studio and SimHydraulic in Matlab/Simulink library are used to model the hydraulic circuit. Using PLC program, the bending operation is controlled. The press had {{to be capable of}} withstanding 2 tons of force. The <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> are designed to be rigidly fixed and easily removable, changeable to any kind of forming operation with decreasing of spring back effect of the sheet metal...|$|R
40|$|The project, {{which have}} been created within the {{framework}} study of engineering branch N 2326, submit project technology process of pressing - part from micro-alloyed steel with higher yield point H 240 LA and proposal of tool design for its pressing. Technology process was designed in ten operations, base on literary studying of cold forming technology. Design of progressive die respects type of press machine, which is specified for production this part. Press KRUPP 400 t disposes pressing force 4 000 kN. Materials, used for design of tool, are in use by tool shops. <b>Punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>punching</b> <b>dies</b> are produced from steels 19 573, heat-treated according drawing documentation. Drawing <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> are produced from steel 19 552, hardened on 56 + 2 HRc and coated by TiCN method...|$|R
50|$|<b>Punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> are {{typically}} made of tool steel, however cheaper (but softer) carbon steel is sometimes used in less severe applications. It is also common to see cemented carbides used where high wear and abrasive resistance is present.Alloy steels are normally {{used for the}} ejector system to kick the part out and in durable and heat resistant blankholders.|$|R
50|$|Accuracy. A {{properly}} sharpened die, {{with the}} correct amount of clearance between the <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die,</b> will produce a part that holds close dimensional tolerances {{in relationship to the}} part's edges.|$|E
50|$|The {{compound}} tool {{differs from}} progressive and stage tools by {{the arrangement of}} the <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die.</b> It is an inverted tool where blanking and piercing takes place in a single stage and also the blanking punch will act as the piercing die.|$|E
5000|$|A typical CNC {{turret punch}} has {{a choice of}} up to 60 tools in a [...] "turret" [...] that can be rotated to bring any tool to the {{punching}} position. A simple shape (e.g., a square, circle, or hexagon) is cut directly from the sheet. A complex shape can be cut out by making many square or rounded cuts around the perimeter. As a press tool requires a matching <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> set, there are two corresponding turrets, {{above and below the}} bed, for <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die.</b> These two turrets must rotate in precise synchronisation and with their alignment carefully maintained. Several punches of identical shape may be used in the turret, each one turned to a different angle, as there is usually no feature to rotate the sheet workpiece relative to the tool.|$|E
50|$|The linear {{tool carrier}} (y-axis) has several {{stations}} {{that hold the}} <b>punching</b> tools <b>and</b> one cutting tool. Especially for flexibility and efficient processing are setup times a crucial cost factor. Downtimes should {{be reduced to a}} minimum. Therefore, recent tool systems are designed for fast and convenient change of <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies.</b> They are equipped with a special plug-in system for a quick and easy change of tools.|$|R
50|$|Contemporary typographers view {{typography}} as craft with a {{very long}} history tracing its origins {{back to the first}} <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> used to make seals and currency in ancient times. The basic elements of typography are at least as old as civilization and the earliest writing systems - a series of key developments that were eventually drawn together into one, systematic craft.|$|R
40|$|This work {{demonstrates}} {{the feasibility of}} meso-scale (100 µm to mm) punching of multiple holes of intricate shapes in metals. Analytical modeling, finite element (FE) simulation, and experimentations are used in this work. Two dimensional FE simulations in ABAQUS were done with an assumed material modeling and plane-strain condition. A known analytical model was used and compared with the ABAQUS simulation results to understand the effects of clearance between the <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> the <b>die.</b> FE simulation in ABAQUS was done for different clearances and corner radii at <b>punch,</b> <b>die,</b> <b>and</b> holder. A set of <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> were used to punch out a miniature spring-steel gripper. Comparison of compliant grippers manufactured by wire-cut electro discharge machining (EDM) <b>and</b> <b>punching</b> shows that realizing sharp interior and re-entrant corners by punching {{is not easy to}} achieve. Punching of circular holes with 5 mm and 2. 5 mm diameter is achieved. The possibility of realizing meso-scale parts with complicated shapes through punching is demonstrated in this work; and some strategies are suggested for improvement...|$|R
5000|$|Punching is {{performed}} {{by placing the}} sheet of metal stock between a punch and a die mounted in a press. The <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> are made of hardened steel and are the same shape. The punch is sized {{to be a very}} close fit in the die. The press pushes the punch against and into the die with enough force to cut a hole in the stock. In some cases the <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> [...] "nest" [...] together to create a depression in the stock. In progressive stamping a coil of stock is fed into a long die/punch set with many stages. Multiple simple shaped holes may be produced in one stage, but complex holes are created in multiple stages. In the final stage, the part is punched free from the [...] "web".|$|E
50|$|Usually, the <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> {{are close}} to the same dimensions, {{creating}} a sheared edge when they meet. A punch that is significantly smaller than the die can be used to produce an extruded hole where the punch displaces the punched material to the sides, forming a tube perpendicular to the punched sheet.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} approach to designing the <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> to produce parts successfully {{is to build}} try-out tools to check {{the ability of a}} certain tool design to produce parts of the required quality. Try-out tools are typically made of less expensive materials to reduce try-out costs yet this method is still costly and time-consuming.|$|E
40|$|To {{optimize}} the blanking process of thin copper sheets, {{it is necessary}} to study the influence of the radial clearance as well as the wear of the <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> the <b>die.</b> Finite Element simulations, using ABAQUS/Explicit, of the blanking process are conducted and the results are compared to the experimental investigations. The predicted cut edge of the blanked part and the punch-force displacement curves are discussed as function of the process parameters. The evolution of the shape errors according to the radial clearance, the <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> the <b>die</b> wear, <b>and</b> the contact punch/die/blank-holder are presented...|$|R
40|$|The work proposes {{production}} of a bend part made of 2 mm thick steel sheet 11 320 with 50 000 parts made per year. Based on the literary study of this problematic the production was chosen to be made with combined processing tool for bending and shearing. The tool is designed to do two shearing and one bending operation. Due to the enclosed shape of the bend the part is ejected from the side perpendicularly to the direction of motion of the sheet belt. The mechanical press S 160 with nominal forming force of 1600 kN was chosen for the production. Shearing <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>punching</b> <b>dies</b> are made of tool steel 19 422. Bending <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> are made of carbon steel 19 312. Price per unit was set to be 12, 61 Kč. Break even point was counted to 34 849 parts...|$|R
5000|$|Cold forming (cold heading): Cold forming {{is similar}} to {{extruding}} in that it squeezes the blank material but cold forming uses the <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> the <b>die</b> to create the desired form, extruding does not.|$|R

50|$|The {{workpiece}} {{is often}} {{in the form of}} a sheet or roll. Materials for the workpiece can vary, commonly being metals and plastics. The <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> themselves can have a variety of shapes to create an array of different shaped holes in the workpiece. Multiple punches may be used together to create a part in one step.|$|E
50|$|Lubricants {{are used}} to reduce {{friction}} between the working material and the <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die.</b> They also aid in removing the part from the punch. Some examples of lubricants used in drawing operations are heavy-duty emulsions, phosphates, white lead, and wax films. Plastic films covering {{both sides of the}} part while used with a lubricant will leave the part with a fine surface.|$|E
50|$|Sheet metal forming, {{which is}} often {{referred}} to as stamping, is a process in which a piece of sheet metal, referred to as the blank, is formed by stretching between a <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> a <b>die.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{holder of}} outdoor {{air-conditioning}} units are {{made out of}} steel 11 321. 21 with 2 mm thickness. The production quantity is 2000 units / year. The holder is produced using CNC machine for cutting and bending on CNC press brake. The semi-finished product is a metal sheet (2 x 2000 x 1000 mm). Part of this diploma thesis is to design of the population with the punching tools, the layout of parts on the metal sheet and design of appropriate press brake <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies.</b> The conclusion contains economic evaluation of the proposed solution...|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} {{there is an}} attempt to use theory of {{flexible}} plates and shells to explain the behavior of the thin stripes under blanking <b>and</b> <b>punching</b> operations. Now an opinion exists that results of thick sheet blanked parts of usually round shape are applied to thin sheet ones including also intricate shapes. But judging on the wear of <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies,</b> the picture of their loading is changing {{at the end of the}} first stage of blanking ? the flexible deformation. Attempts to explain this process for thin sheet material are connected with redistribution of acting loads because of flexibility of sheet stock. ? ?????? ???????????? ???????????? ?????? ?????? ??????? ? ???????? ??? ?????????? ????????? ????????????? ????? ? ???????? ???????-????????. ? ????????? ????? ?? ????????? ?????????? ??????? ??????? ??????? ????? ?? ??????????????? ????????? ??????????? ?? ????????????? ?????? ??????? ????????????. ????? ???, ???? ?? ?????? ??????? ??????? ??????, ??????? ?????????? ??? ??? ????????? ? ????? ?????? ?????? ??????? ? ??????? ??????????. ??????? ????????? ???? ??????? ??? ????????????? ?????????? ??????? ? ?????????????????? ??????????? ?????? ?? ??????? ?????? ?? ???? ???????????? ?????????...|$|R
