5|$|By {{the early}} part of the 1960s, however, the Nashville sound had become {{perceived}} as too watered-down by many more traditionalist <b>performers</b> and fans, resulting in a number of local scenes like the Bakersfield sound. A few <b>performers</b> retained popularity, however, such as the long-standing cultural icon Johnny Cash. The Bakersfield sound began in the mid to late 1950s when <b>performers</b> like Wynn Stewart and Buck Owens began using elements of Western swing and rock, such as the breakbeat, in their music. In the 1960s <b>performers</b> like Merle Haggard popularized the sound. In the early 1970s, Haggard was also part of outlaw country, alongside singer-songwriters such as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was rock-oriented and lyrically focused on the criminal antics of the <b>performers,</b> in contrast to the clean-cut country singers of the Nashville sound. By the middle of the 1980s, the country music charts were dominated by pop singers, alongside a nascent revival of honky-tonk-style country with the rise of <b>performers</b> like Dwight Yoakam. The 1980s also saw the development of alternative country <b>performers</b> like Uncle Tupelo, who were opposed to the more pop-oriented style of mainstream country. At the beginning of the 2000s, rock-oriented country acts remained among the best-selling <b>performers</b> in the United States, especially Garth Brooks.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, Donaldson made a then-controversial move {{by hiring}} an African-American {{journalist}} James Albert Jackson {{to write a}} weekly column devoted to African-American <b>performers.</b> According to The Business of Culture: Strategic Perspectives on Entertainment and Media, the column identified discrimination against black <b>performers</b> and helped validate their careers. Jackson {{was the first black}} critic at a national magazine with a predominantly white audience. According to his grandson, Donaldson also established a policy against identifying <b>performers</b> by their race. Donaldson died in 1925.|$|E
50|$|The <b>performer</b> {{is viewed}} from the side. The <b>performer's</b> legs may be covered (commonly with a jacket) at the {{beginning}} of the effect. At this point the <b>performer</b> may patter, saying something like, “You may have seen other magicians levitate behind a jacket...". This is a reference to the Superman levitation. The obstruction (jacket, etc.) would then be removed. The <b>performer's</b> whole body is clearly visible. The <b>performer</b> suddenly appears to levitate a few inches above the ground. Both feet are clearly seen to be in the air. The levitation usually lasts just a few seconds. When both feet return to the ground, the <b>performer's</b> legs may again be momentarily obscured. The <b>performer</b> may again make a comparative reference to the Superman levitation. Immediately afterwards the effect is complete, and the <b>performer</b> (particularly the <b>performer's</b> clothing) and the area around the <b>performer</b> can be thoroughly examined.|$|R

5|$|Peking opera {{features}} {{four main}} types of <b>performers.</b> Performing troupes often have several of each variety, {{as well as}} numerous secondary and tertiary <b>performers.</b> With their elaborate and colorful costumes, <b>performers</b> are the only focal points on Peking opera's characteristically sparse stage. They use the skills of speech, song, dance, and combat in movements that are symbolic and suggestive, rather than realistic. Above all else, the skill of <b>performers</b> is evaluated according to the beauty of their movements. <b>Performers</b> also adhere {{to a variety of}} stylistic conventions that help audiences navigate the plot of the production. The layers of meaning within each movement must be expressed in time with music. The music of Peking opera can be divided into the Xipi (西皮) and Erhuang (二黄) styles. Melodies include arias, fixed-tune melodies, and percussion patterns. The repertoire of Peking opera includes over 1,400 works, which are based on Chinese history, folklore, and, increasingly, contemporary life.|$|E

40|$|Key presses of 1 monkey (called the <b>performer)</b> {{became the}} basis upon which a 2 nd monkey (called the judge) solved conditional-discrimination tasks. First, the <b>performer</b> was trained to press one of two colored choice keys (red or green) {{depending}} on {{the location of a}} white light in her chamber. The <b>performer's</b> key-pressing behavior was brought {{under the control of the}} experimenter by this procedure. Subsequently, the judge was trained to discriminate the <b>performer's</b> key-pressing behavior. In Experiment 1, the judge had to press Key 1 when the <b>performer</b> pressed the red choice key and Key 2 when the <b>performer</b> pressed the green choice key. In Experiment 2, a sample key was introduced. The judge had to press Key 1 when the <b>performer</b> pressed the same colored choice key as the sample; the judge had to press Key 2 when the <b>performer</b> pressed the different colored choice key. In both experiments, the judge was required to attend to the behavior of the <b>performer.</b> It was shown that the <b>performer's</b> behavior served as a discriminative stimulus for the judge's responses in a conditional-discrimination task...|$|R
