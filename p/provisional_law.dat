5000|$|The {{first use}} of the term {{behavior}} modification appears to have been by Edward Thorndike in 1911.

Through early research in the 1940s and the 1950s the term was used by Joseph Wolpe's research group. The experimental tradition in clinical psychology used it to refer to psycho-therapeutic techniques derived from empirical research. It has since come to refer mainly to techniques for increasing adaptive behavior through reinforcement and decreasing maladaptive behavior through extinction or punishment (with emphasis on the former). Emphasizing the empirical roots of behavior modification, some authors consider it to be broader in scope and to subsume the other two categories of behavior change methods.|$|R

50|$|The {{conservative}} Højre had {{pressed for}} a new constitution, giving the upper chamber of parliament more power, making it more exclusive and switching power to the conservatives from the original long standing dominance of the National liberals, who lost influence and was later disbanded. This long period of dominance of the Højre party {{under the leadership of}} Jacob Brønnum Scavenius Estrup with the backing of the king Christian IX of Denmark was named the provisorietid (provisional period) because the government was based on <b>provisional</b> <b>laws</b> instead of parliamentary decisions. This also gave rise to a conflict with the Liberals (farm owners) at that time and now known as Venstre (Left). This constitutional battle concluded in 1901 with the so-called systemskifte (change of system) with the liberals as victors.

40|$|The {{expulsion}} of aliens in Belgium {{is a topic}} that must be studied in {{the larger context of}} immigration policy and the legal status of aliens. In the nineteenth century, the Belgian law on this subject was vague. A <b>provisional</b> <b>law</b> was enacted in 1835, during a period disrupted by conflict with The Netherlands. This law was renewed until 1897 when it became permanent. The regulations issued by the Minister of Justice and the administrative jurisprudence were used to compensate the uncertainty surrounding the <b>provisional</b> <b>law.</b> Consequently, the aliens' fate often depended on the discretionary power of the administrator of the "Sûreté publique", the principal actor in this matter. The "Sûreté publique", and in particular the "Police des étrangers" department, was seconded by the municipal police, by the "gendarmerie" and and its foreign equivalents. This collaboration sometimes had mixed results, but also resulted in quite outstanding information networks. When classifying expelled aliens using Sûreté statistics, one notes that a large majority of cases have to do with vagrancy, followed by crimes and misdemeanours and political reasons. This distribution reflects the objectives of Belgian immigration policy: ensuring public order and protecting national economic and political interests. During the 19 th century this policy shifted between severity and flexibility and depended on international events or economic conjuncture. The period beginning with the Independence and ending in the early 1850 's was characterised by security measures, because of the conflict with The Netherlands, the bad economic conjuncture and the French revolution of 1848, causing an influx of French outlaws of the Second Empire. From 1853, when the situation in France calmed down, to the Commune (1871), the political and economic situation was stable and the state's intervention was limited. From 1871 to 1914, the number of expulsion measures grew due to the Commune and the new recession. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether the {{temporary}} protection policy for the Japanese oil industry provided by the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Law</b> on Importation of Specific Petroleum Products (Tokusekiho) between 1986 and 1996 was a credible policy. This policy plays a role as an incentive device forcing competition, but whether it functions effectively depends on whether the oil industry regarded the 'Temporariness' of the policy as being credible. The effectiveness of the law is analysed by measuring changes in the cost structure of four oil firms in the oil industry before, during and after the period of protection. It is found that the cost function of each firm shifted upwards during the period of protection, suggesting that the incentives did not work effectively. This implies that the temporary protection policy lacked credibility. ...|$|E
