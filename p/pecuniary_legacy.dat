40|$|Under a {{declaration}} of trust executed by her uncle, Mariah Louise Moore held an equitable life estate in the trust fund of $ 12, 000, with a power of appointment over the remainder to "such-person or persons, in such shares and proportions, " as she should appoint by will. On April 21, 1934, the said life tenant died leaving a will which, after directing payment of her debts, contained genera! <b>pecuniary</b> <b>legacies</b> of $ 5, 000 to a granddaughter and $ 2, 000 each to three other grandchildren. The will then concluded with a residuary devise and bequest of "all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed, " to her daughter and son.

500|$|In {{the last}} two decades of his life, Cibber {{remained}} prominent in society, and summered in Georgian spas such as Tunbridge, Scarborough and Bath. He was friendly with the writer Samuel Richardson, the actress Margaret Woffington and the memoirist–poet Laetitia Pilkington. Aged 73 in 1745, he made his last appearance on the stage as Pandulph in his own [...] "deservedly unsuccessful" [...] Papal Tyranny in the Reign of King John. In 1750, he fell seriously ill and recommended his friend and protégé Henry Jones as the next Poet Laureate. Cibber recovered and Jones passed into obscurity. Cibber died suddenly at his house in Berkeley Square, London, in December 1757, leaving small <b>pecuniary</b> <b>legacies</b> to four of his five surviving children, £1,000 each (the equivalent of approximately £180,000 in 2011) to his granddaughters Jane and Elizabeth (the daughters of Theophilus), and the residue of his estate to his eldest daughter Catherine. He was buried on 18 December, probably at the Grosvenor Chapel on South Audley Street.|$|R

5000|$|Patricia Rubin has {{recorded}} that Salting’s ‘generous intentions {{were known to}} his friends and…influenced his collecting’, [...] and that Of ‘eclectic mind and sensitive eye’, Salting was ‘cosmopolitan’ in his acquisitions from the outset. Inspired and guided by his friend Louis Huth, he was soon buying oriental ceramics of great quality and in great quantity.’ In Salting’s collecting of ceramics, the influence of Huth - by whom ‘he had been introduced to {{the beauty of the}} art form’ [...] - was pivotal, as is recorded by several writers. By his will, dated 14 October 1889, Salting also gave various <b>pecuniary</b> <b>legacies,</b> including £2,000 to Louis Huth ‘who’, as Rubin has stated, ‘is credited with guiding salting’s early collecting’. [...] Huth’s death in 1905 would have caused the legacy to lapse, but Salting obviously took no steps then or in the remaining four years of his own life to re-write the will or to add a codicil to it. Huth’s collection of antique porcelain was first rate. By any parameters his collection of British paintings, let alone those of other schools, was of high quality, and Huth’s patronage of contemporary British or British-based artists, amongst them Watts and Whistler, was considerable. It is unclear how many of these paintings, particularly of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, had already been acquired by Louis Huth before his marriage in 1855, [...] {{but it is clear that}} the development of the collection from the mid-1850s extended to the commissioning also of one of the leading sculptors of the day, Alexander Munro.|$|R
40|$|This work {{is divided}} into four chapters. The first chapter covers with the ways leading to the {{salvation}} of the soul. Especially {{with the question of}} the dogma of purgatory and the ways, how can - according to Thomas Stitny - the quick help to compress the torture of the dead sinners in purgatory. The issue of the second chapter is a quantitative analysis of the pious <b>legacies</b> <b>pecuniary</b> as well as non-pecuniary. The fundamental research questions are: Which charitable institutions were gifted the most frequently? How large number and volume of legacies was intended for them? How differed the structure of male and female pious legacies? Which changes in the type and the volume of the pious legacies occurred during the followed period and what were the main causes of them? In the third chapter I am analyzing all the non-pecuniary legacies and ask myself the question to which extent are in their structure reflected gender and socio-economic differences among the testators. In the fourth chapter I reenact the geographical horizon of the testators. My aim is to verify an assumption that the size of the geographical horizon of the burghers is directly proportional to the total importance of the town in question...|$|R
