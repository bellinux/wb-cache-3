5|$|Darwin's {{barnacle}} studies {{convinced him}} that variation arose constantly {{and not just in}} response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. He now realised that the branching pattern of evolutionary divergence was explained by natural selection working constantly to improve adaptation. His thinking changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in fancy <b>pigeon</b> <b>breeding,</b> and experimented (with the help of his son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.|$|E
25|$|Variation under {{domestication}} {{became a}} major topic of research: in 1855 he began to develop a web of contacts, both in the UK and worldwide, to get information on the origins and variation of domesticated animals, particularly poultry, ducks, rabbits, and pigeons.

At the suggestion of William Yarrell, Darwin began <b>pigeon</b> <b>breeding</b> at Down House to investigate varieties of domestic pigeons, and gained access to the expertise of William Bernhard Tegetmeier who was glad to research aspects of interest to Darwin. From March, he also got information and specimens from his relative William Darwin Fox who bred poultry and ducks at his rectory in the parish of Delamere, Cheshire.|$|E

40|$|In {{the article}} are {{presented}} {{the results of}} our research on chlamydophilosis in parrots, free-living and <b>breeding</b> <b>pigeons,</b> and intensive <b>breeding</b> chickens in Bosnia and Herzegovina. For detection of the antigen two immunoenzyme tests for the detection of antibodies against Chlamydophila psittaci and a complement fixation test by a Kolmer and indirect immunofluorescence method (BioMerieux, France) were used. From a total of 275 samples of cloacal swabs the presence of Chlamydophila psittaci antigen was detected by ELISA (DAKO Ltd., United Kingdom) in 34. 9 % birds: 45. 5 % in intensive breeding chickens, 12. 1 % in free-living pigeons and 8. 0 % in parrots. By the same method the presence of Chlamydophila psittaci antigen in <b>breeding</b> <b>pigeons</b> was not detected. Sixty cloacal swabs from intensive <b>breeding</b> chickens and <b>pigeons</b> were tested by immunoenzyme test (Unipath Limited, England) and the presence of the pathogen was found in 6. 7 % cases. Fifty-eight sera from free-living <b>pigeons</b> and intensive <b>breeding</b> chickens were tested for the presence of specific antibodies to Chlamydophila psittaci by indirect immunofluorescence method and were found in 42. 1 % examined sera of pigeons, and in 27. 6 % pigeons from the total number of examined birds. The presence of specific antibodies was not found in sera of intensive breeding chickens. Using a complement fixation test, antibodies were not detected in the examined sera in pigeons nor in intensive breeding chickens. The results of this study show that the presence of antigens and antibodies for Chlamydophila psittaci is obvious in tested sera samples, but the clinical disease was not found in any of the examined birds...|$|R
500|$|Charles Darwin read Sir John's 1809 pamphlet, and was {{impressed}} with a passage that elaborated on how [...] "the weak and the unhealthy do not live to propagate their infirmities". These writings, along with Darwin's correspondence via their mutual friend William Yarrell, aided Darwin in the inception of Darwin's theory of natural selection. Darwin's seminal work On the Origin of Species, first published in 1859, cited Sir John's experiments in <b>pigeon</b> <b>breeding,</b> and recalled [...] "That most skilful breeder, Sir John Sebright, used to say, with respect to pigeons, that 'he would produce any given feather in three years, {{but it would take}} him six years to obtain head and beak.'" [...] Darwin also cited Sir John extensively regarding the Sebright bantam, as well as pigeon and dog breeding, in his 1868 work Variation of Plants and Animals Under Domestication, his 1871 The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, and his book on Natural Selection (which was not published in his lifetime).|$|E

2500|$|Another {{reason for}} his {{criticism}} of the Origin, some historians claim, was that Owen felt upstaged by Darwin and supporters such as Huxley, and his judgment was clouded by jealousy. Owen in Darwin's opinion was [...] "Spiteful, extremely malignant, clever; the Londoners say he is mad with envy because my book is so talked about". [...] "It is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which Owen hates me". Owen also resorted to the same subterfuge he used against Mantell, writing another anonymous article in the Edinburgh Review in April 1860. In the article, Owen was critical of Darwin for not offering many new observations, and heaped praise (in the third person) upon himself, while {{being careful not to}} associate any particular comment with his own name. Owen did praise, however, the Origins description of Darwin's work on insect behavior and <b>pigeon</b> <b>breeding</b> as Huxley, Thomas H., (1861), [...] "On the Zoological Relations of Man with the Lower Animals", Natural History Review 1: 67â€“84."real gems".|$|E

60|$|The two {{principles}} above given {{seem to me}} {{to explain}} these facts in regard to the later embryonic stages of our domestic varieties. Fanciers select their horses, dogs, and <b>pigeons,</b> for <b>breeding,</b> when they are nearly grown up: they are indifferent whether the desired qualities and structures have been acquired earlier or later in life, if the full-grown animal possesses them. And the cases just given, more especially that of pigeons, seem to show that the characteristic differences which give value to each breed, and which have been accumulated by man's selection, have not generally first appeared at an early period of life, and have been inherited by the offspring at a corresponding not early period. But the case of the short-faced tumbler, which when twelve hours old had acquired its proper proportions, proves {{that this is not the}} universal rule; for here the characteristic differences must either have appeared at an earlier period than usual, or, if not so, the differences must have been inherited, not at the corresponding, but at an earlier age.|$|R

Besides the descendants of the so-called Golden Couple [...] "Oude Van den Bosch x Blue Janssen" [...] also brought the descendants of a new super breeding pair [...] "Blue Saelen x Oude Bourgeske" [...] excellent results.

He was, however, do not have the time to end the cooperation. In April 1980 Frans Marien committed suicide for reasons still unclear. By a clause in the cooperation contract, all the racing and <b>breeding</b> <b>pigeons</b> want to be sold with 20 pigeons in a way, where Karles had to pay as much for the 20 pigeons he kept than their encores in the auction had raised.

40|$|Homing pigeons develop {{preferred}} routes when released alone {{several times}} {{from the same}} site, but they sometimes diverge from their preferred route when subsequently released with another pigeon. Additionally, group flights show a better homing performance than solo flights. But this knowledge is based on studies involving both sexes and lacks analyses of social parameters such as mating or breeding status, {{even though it is}} known that such parameters have an influence on behavior and on motivation for specific behavioral patterns. GPS trackers were used to track 24 homing <b>pigeons</b> (9 <b>breeding</b> pairs and 6 unmated females) as they performed a familiar 10 km route in various pair and group combinations. Comparisons of efficiency indices (quotient between straight-line distance and pigeon's track) reveal that unmated females show the best efficiency in single flights. Generally, group flights show the best efficiency followed by pair flights with a social partner of the opposite sex. Pair flights with the mated partner exhibit the poorest performance. Additionally, just before squabs hatching, females show a higher efficiency index when released at 8 am, compared to releases at 2 pm. Our results indicate that homing flight efficiency can provide insight into individual motivation and that social parameters have an influence on homing performance on a familiar route...|$|R
60|$|With {{respect to}} domesticated animals, as their {{domestication}} mainly {{depends on the}} accident of their breeding freely under captivity, {{we ought not to}} expect that their reproductive system would be affected by any moderate degree of change. Those orders of quadrupeds and birds, of which the wild species breed most readily in our menageries, have afforded us the greatest number of domesticated productions. Savages {{in most parts of the}} world are fond of taming animals (18/68. Numerous instances could be given. Thus Livingstone ('Travels' page 217) states that the King of the Barotse, an inland tribe which never had any communication with white men, was extremely fond of taming animals, and every young antelope was brought to him. Mr. Galton informs me that the Damaras are likewise fond of keeping pets. The Indians of South America follow the same habit. Capt. Wilkes states that the Polynesians of the Samoan Islands tamed pigeons; and the New Zealanders, as Mr. Mantell informs me, kept various kinds of birds.); and if any of these regularly produced young, and were at the same time useful, they would be at once domesticated. If, when their masters migrated into other countries, they were in addition found capable of withstanding various climates, they would be still more valuable; and it appears that the animals which breed readily in captivity can generally withstand different climates. Some few domesticated animals, such as the reindeer and camel, offer an exception to this rule. Many of our domesticated animals can bear with undiminished fertility the most unnatural conditions; for instance, rabbits, guinea-pigs, and ferrets breed in miserably confined hutches. Few European dogs of any kind withstand the climate of India without degenerating, but as long as they survive, they retain, as I hear from Dr. Falconer, their fertility; so it is, according to Dr. Daniell, with English dogs taken to Sierra Leone. The fowl, a native of the hot jungles of India, becomes more fertile than its parent-stock in every quarter of the world, until we advance as far north as Greenland and Northern Siberia, where this bird will not breed. Both fowls and pigeons, which I received during the autumn direct from Sierra Leone, were at once ready to couple. (18/69. For analogous cases with the fowl see Reaumur 'L'Art de faire Eclore' etc. 1749 page 243; and Col. Sykes in 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1832 etc. With respect to the fowl not breeding in northern regions see Latham 'Hist. of Birds' volume 8 1823 page 169.) I have, also, seen <b>pigeons</b> <b>breeding</b> as freely as the common kinds within a year after their importation from the upper Nile. The guinea- fowl, an aboriginal of the hot and dry deserts of Africa, whilst living under our damp and cool climate, produces a large supply of eggs.|$|R

25|$|In the Spring of 1855, as the Crimean war developed, Darwin was {{pondering the}} war of nature, taking the then current analogy with an {{industrial}} economy further than others, and wondering how species spread.

He reported his results in Gardeners' Chronicle and roped in his curate friends including Henslow. The consul in Norway sent seed pods which had washed ashore. Hooker was able to identify them as coming from the Caribbean {{and get them to}} germinate at Kew. Investigation of variation brought him back to animal husbandry.

60|$|With {{respect to}} crossed breeds {{frequently}} producing blue birds chequered with black, and resembling {{in all respects}} both the dovecote-pigeon and the chequered wild variety of the rock-pigeon, the statement before referred to by MM. Boitard and Corbie would almost suffice; but I will give three instances of the appearance of such birds from crosses in which one alone of the parents or great-grandparents was blue, but not chequered. I crossed a male blue Turbit with a snow-white Trumpeter, and the following year with a dark, leaden-brown, Short-faced Tumbler; the offspring from the first cross were as perfectly chequered as any dovecote-pigeon; and from the second, so much {{so as to be}} nearly as black as the most darkly chequered rock-pigeon from Madeira. Another bird, whose great-grandparents were a white Trumpeter, a white Fantail, a white Red-spot, a red Runt, and a blue Pouter, was slaty-blue and chequered exactly like a dovecote-pigeon. I may here add a remark made to me by Mr. Wicking, who has had more experience than any other person in England in <b>breeding</b> <b>pigeons</b> of various colours: namely, that when a blue, or a blue and chequered bird, having black wing- bars, once appears in any race and is allowed to breed, these characters are so strongly transmitted that it is extremely difficult to eradicate them.|$|R
