50|$|Strings are {{recognized}} {{by looking for}} sequences of at least 4 (by default) printable characters terminating in a NUL character (that is, null-terminated strings). Some implementations provide options for determining what is recognized as a <b>printable</b> <b>character,</b> which is useful for finding non-ASCII and wide character text.|$|E
50|$|Drum printers, where a {{horizontally}} mounted {{rotating drum}} carries the entire character {{set of the}} printer repeated in each <b>printable</b> <b>character</b> position. The IBM 1132 printer {{is an example of}} a drum printer. Drum printers are also found in adding machines and other numeric printers (POS), the dimensions are compact as only a dozen characters need to be supported.|$|E
50|$|XFS {{provides}} multiple data streams for files; this is {{made possible}} by its implementation of extended attributes. These allow the storage {{of a number of}} name/value pairs attached to a file. Names are nul-terminated <b>printable</b> <b>character</b> strings which are up to 256 bytes in length, while their associated values can contain up to 64 KB of binary data.|$|E
50|$|Codes 20hex to 7Ehex, {{known as}} the <b>printable</b> <b>characters,</b> {{represent}} letters, digits, punctuation marks, and a few miscellaneous symbols. There are 95 <b>printable</b> <b>characters</b> in total.|$|R
50|$|PEM {{requires}} that all encoded lines consist of exactly 64 <b>printable</b> <b>characters,</b> {{with the exception}} of the last line, which may contain fewer <b>printable</b> <b>characters.</b> Lines are delimited by whitespace characters according to local (platform-specific) conventions.|$|R
50|$|ASCII is a 7-bit standard, {{allowing}} {{a total of}} 128 characters in the character set. Some of these are reserved as control <b>characters,</b> leaving 96 <b>printable</b> <b>characters.</b> This set of 96 <b>printable</b> <b>characters</b> includes upper and lower case letters, numbers, and basic math and punctuation.|$|R
5000|$|Computer text {{is mostly}} created from font files that {{describe}} {{the outlines of}} each <b>printable</b> <b>character</b> or symbol (glyph). (A minority are [...] "bit maps".) These outlines have to be converted into what are effectively little rasters, one per character, before being rendered (displayed or printed) as text, in effect merging their little rasters into that for the page.|$|E
50|$|When encoding, {{each group}} of 4 bytes is taken as a 32-bit binary number, most {{significant}} byte first (Ascii85 uses a big-endian convention). This is converted, by repeatedly dividing by 85 and taking the remainder, into 5 radix-85 digits. Then each digit (again, most significant first) is encoded as an ASCII <b>printable</b> <b>character</b> by adding 33 to it, giving the ASCII characters 33 ("") through 117 ("").|$|E
5000|$|The {{substitute}} character (SUB) {{was intended to}} request a translation of the next character from a <b>printable</b> <b>character</b> to another value, usually by setting bit 5 to zero. This is handy because some media (such as sheets of paper produced by typewriters) can transmit only printable characters. However, on MS-DOS systems with files opened in text mode, [...] "end of text" [...] or [...] "end of file" [...] is marked by this Ctrl-Z character, instead of the Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D, which are common on other operating systems.|$|E

5000|$|Informally, {{each line}} of {{text in the}} header that begins with a <b>printable</b> <b>character</b> begins a {{separate}} field. The field name starts in the first character {{of the line and}} ends before the separator character [...] ":". The separator is then followed by the field value (the [...] "body" [...] of the field). The value is continued onto subsequent lines if those lines have a space or tab as their first character. Field names and values are restricted to 7-bit ASCII characters. Some non-ASCII values may be represented using MIME encoded words.|$|E
5000|$|Sixel encodes images by {{breaking}} up the bitmap {{into a series of}} 6-pixel high horizontal strips. Each 1-pixel-wide vertical column in a particular strip forms a single sixel. Each sixel's pixels are read as binary and encoded into a single 6-bit number, with [...] "on" [...] pixels encoded as a 1. This number, from 0 to 63 decimal, is then converted into a single ASCII character, offset by 63 so that an all-black sixel, 0 decimal, is encoded as [...] This ensures that the sixels remain within the <b>printable</b> <b>character</b> range of the ASCII character set. Carriage return (CR) is represented by , and line feeds (LF) with a both had to be sent in turn to return the cursor {{to the start of the}} line, [...]|$|E
5000|$|Code 127 (DEL, a.k.a. [...] "rubout") is {{likewise}} a special case. Its 7-bit code is all-bits-on in binary, which essentially erased a character cell {{on a paper}} tape when overpunched. Paper tape was a common storage medium when ASCII was developed, with a computing history dating back to WWII code breaking equipment at Biuro Szyfrów. Paper tape became obsolete in the 1970s, so this clever aspect of ASCII rarely saw any use after that. Some systems (such as the original Apples) converted it to a backspace. But because its code is in the range occupied by other printable characters, and because it had no official assigned glyph, many computer equipment vendors used it as an additional <b>printable</b> <b>character</b> (often an all-black [...] "box" [...] character useful for erasing text by overprinting with ink).|$|E
5000|$|Table rows 2 to 7 (except {{character}} 127, 7Fhex), codes 32 to 126 (20hex to 7Ehex), are {{the standard}} ASCII <b>printable</b> <b>characters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This {{character}} encoding is a superset of ISO 8859-1 {{in terms}} of <b>printable</b> <b>characters,</b> but differs from the IANA's ISO-8859-1 by using displayable characters rather than control characters in the 80 to 9F (hex) range. Notable additional characters include curly quotation marks and all the <b>printable</b> <b>characters</b> that are in ISO 8859-15 (at different places than ISO 8859-15). It is known to Windows by the code page number 1252, and by the IANA-approved name [...] "windows-1252".|$|R
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} of uuencoding repeats the following for every 3 bytes, encoding them into 4 <b>printable</b> <b>characters,</b> each character representing a radix-64 numerical digit: ...|$|R
5000|$|VT52 {{commands}} normally {{consisted of}} the escape character and a single character following it. The exception to this rule was the Y command, which also required two numbers to be sent, representing the X and Y coordinates of the cursor position, with the upper {{right corner of the}} screen being position 1,1. These numbers were sent as ASCII characters of that value, adding 31. For instance, to position the cursor at column 30 and line 20, you would add 31 to each value to get 61 and 51, then look up those ASCII characters, [...] and [...] The complete command would then be [...] (note the row,column ordering, not X, Y). Adding 31 ensures that the characters are shifted out of the control range into the <b>printable</b> <b>character</b> range, so they will transmit properly on 7-bit links.|$|E
5000|$|A special capability, the [...] "hz" [...] capability, {{was defined}} {{specifically}} {{to support the}} Hazeltine 1500 terminal, which had the unfortunate characteristic of using the ASCII tilde character ('~') as a control sequence introducer. In order to support that terminal, not only did code that used the database have to know about using the tilde to introduce certain control sequences, but it also had to know to substitute another <b>printable</b> <b>character</b> for any tildes in the displayed text, since a tilde in the text would be interpreted by the terminal as {{the start of a}} control sequence, resulting in missing text and screen garbling. [...] Additionally, attribute markers (such as start and end of underlining) themselves took up space on the screen. Comments in the database source code often referred to this as [...] "Hazeltine braindamage". [...] Since the Hazeltine 1500 was a widely used terminal in the late 1970s, it was important for applications to {{be able to deal with}} its limitations.|$|E
5000|$|For both serializations of HTML (content-type [...] "text/html" [...] and content/type [...] "application/xhtml+xml"), the Byte order mark (BOM) is an {{effective}} way to transmit encoding information within an HTML document. For UTF-8, the BOM is optional, while it is a must for the UTF-16 and the UTF-32 encodings. (Note: UTF-16 and UTF-32 without the BOM are formally known under different names, they are different encodings, and thus needs some form of encoding declaration - see UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32LE and UTF-32BE.) The use of the BOM character (U+FEFF) means that the encoding automatically declares itself to any processing application. Processing applications need only look for an initial 0x0000FEFF, 0xFEFF or 0xEFBBBF in the byte stream to identify the document as UTF-32, UTF-16 or UTF-8 encoded respectively. No additional metadata mechanisms are required for these encodings since the byte-order mark includes all of the information necessary for processing applications. In most circumstances the byte-order mark character is handled by editing applications separately from the other characters so there is little risk of an author removing or otherwise changing the byte order mark to indicate the wrong encoding (as can happen when the encoding is declared in English/Latin script). If the document lacks a byte-order mark, the fact that the first non-blank <b>printable</b> <b>character</b> in an HTML document is supposed to be [...] "<" [...] (U+003C) can be used to determine a UTF-8/UTF-16/UTF-32 encoding.|$|E
50|$|Some other {{encodings}} (base64, uuencoding) {{are based}} on mapping all possible sequences of six bits into different <b>printable</b> <b>characters.</b> Since {{there are more than}} 26 = 64 <b>printable</b> <b>characters,</b> this is possible. A given sequence of bytes is translated by viewing it as stream of bits, breaking this stream in chunks of six bits and generating the sequence of corresponding characters. The different encodings differ in the mapping between sequences of bits and characters and in how the resulting text is formatted.|$|R
50|$|All the <b>printable</b> <b>characters</b> {{from both}} ISO/IEC 8859-1 and ISO/IEC 8859-15 {{are also found}} in Windows-1252. In October 2016 0.1% of all web sites use ISO-8859-15.|$|R
50|$|The byte {{sequence}} is usually restricted to ASCII <b>printable</b> <b>characters,</b> with space characters reserved for padding shorter sequences. Case sensitivity is preserved, unlike in file extensions.|$|R
50|$|Instructions {{for people}} {{on how to}} solve Rubik's type cubes are {{normally}} conveyed either in purely graphical form or as sequences defined using a <b>printable</b> <b>character</b> notation. A character sequence that can be translated and applied to perform a sequence of layer rotations to transform a given state to another (usually less scrambled) state {{is often referred to}} as an algorithm. Algorithms are most commonly used when unscrambling the latter portion of the cube but can be applied more extensively if desired. Algorithms can be written down as instructions that can be memorized or looked up in a document. The printable characters used (e.g. to indicate an anticlockwise quarter turn, a single layer quarter turn or a multiple layer quarter turn) in algorithm instructions vary among authors as does their positions in the instructions. Where people interpret instructions the way they are presented is insignificant. The only time the form of presentation has significance is when computer keyboard entry is used to change the state of software cubes, and automatic updating of the screen image occurs whenever a valid instruction is received. For example, if F′ is used to represent an anticlockwise quarter turn of the front face then, as the user types in F, a clockwise quarter turn will occur and a correction will be needed when the user types the ′ character. The end result will still be correct but use of −F rather than F′ would eliminate the superfluous rotation. Any text enhancements, such as superscripts or subscripts, must be avoided in the method of presenting cube rotation sequences when users communicate with software cubes via keyboard commands. When computer keyboard entry of instructions is used, macros (which map a short input text string to a longer string) can be used as algorithm shortcuts.|$|E
