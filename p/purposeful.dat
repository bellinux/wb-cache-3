5|$|A 2011 {{study by}} Walk Score ranked Denver sixteenth most {{walkable}} of fifty largest U.S. cities, though massive {{gaps in the}} cities sidewalks remain an oft-discussed issue. Many walkability advocates believe the city's need for pedestrian infrastructure is only growing as Denver and the Colorado Department of Transportation place the needs of cars over the needs of people by widening roads or the <b>purposeful</b> plowing of snow onto sidewalks during winter storms.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1930s {{there were a}} variety of spaniels in Moscow, Leningrad and Sverdlovsk that did not fit any {{specific}} spaniel breed standard, but were not yet standardised into the modern Russian Spaniel. <b>Purposeful</b> breeding after World War II led to the original Russian Spaniel standard in 1951. Further revised standards were issued in 1966 and 2000.|$|E
5|$|For the new {{generation}} of students, producers auditioned over six hundred school-aged children in an attempt to provide characters to which the teenaged target-audience could relate. The decision to cast age-similar actors was <b>purposeful</b> to contrast the series from other shows of the same period such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek, which had cast actors in their twenties as teenagers.|$|E
5|$|Physiologically, the {{function}} of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain acts {{on the rest of the}} body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated <b>purposeful</b> control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in the fictional city of Karnaca. After Empress Emily Kaldwin is deposed by the witch Delilah Copperspoon, the player may choose between playing as either Emily or her Royal Protector and father Corvo Attano as they attempt to reclaim the throne. Both Emily and Corvo employ their own array of supernatural abilities, though the player can {{alternatively}} decide to forfeit these abilities altogether. There is a multitude of ways to complete missions, from stealth to <b>purposeful</b> violent conflict, navigated through a sandbox environment.|$|E
5|$|These acts of {{violence}} were influenced by a desire for revenge and retribution for crimes committed by the Nazis during their invasion of the Soviet Union, collectively driven by Soviet propaganda. The propaganda was a <b>purposeful</b> goad to the Soviet soldier and reflected {{the will of the}} political authorities in the Soviet Union right up to Stalin. There is no question that Stalin was aware of what was happening. Given the strict control of the Communist party over the military hierarchy, the pillage and rape in Prussia {{was the result of the}} Soviet command at all levels. Only when Stalin saw that it was in the Soviet Union's interests to check the behaviour of the Red Army did he take steps to stop it.|$|E
5|$|At The Hague 28 April to 1 May 1915, a large {{congress}} of 1,150 women from North America and Europe gathered to discuss peace proposals. The event {{was called the}} International Congress of Women, or the Women's Peace Congress. The 180-strong contingent of British women was greatly reduced by Winston Churchill's <b>purposeful</b> cancellation of British ferry service across the Channel, stranding most of the British activists. Already in Antwerp, Macmillan easily attended the women's conference {{to speak for the}} UK—she was one of only three British women present. Macmillan was selected {{as a member of the}} international committee who were to travel to neutral nations and champion the proposal of the Congress. The Wisconsin Plan was unanimously adopted as the optimum method for returning peace to the world, and Macmillan, Schwimmer and the committee travelled to the neutral US to present President Woodrow Wilson with it. Many of the women's peace proposals were used by Wilson in his Fourteen Points, and the women's efforts helped encourage the later founding of the League of Nations.|$|E
5|$|In July 1860, Willis {{took his}} last major trip. Along with his wife, {{he stopped in}} Chicago and Yellow Springs, Ohio, as far west as Madison, Wisconsin, and also took a {{steamboat}} down the Mississippi River to St. Louis, Missouri, and returned through Cincinnati, Ohio and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1861, Willis allowed the Home Journal to break its pledge to avoid taking sides in political discussions when the Confederate States of America was established, calling the move a <b>purposeful</b> act to bring on war. On May 28, 1861, Willis {{was part of a}} committee of literary figures—including William Cullen Bryant, Charles Anderson Dana, and Horace Greeley—to invite Edward Everett to speak in New York on behalf of maintaining the Union. The Home Journal lost many subscribers during the American Civil War, Morris died in 1864, and the Willis family had to take in boarders and for a time turned Idlewild into a girls' school for income.|$|E
5|$|Teleology {{in biology}} {{is the use}} of the {{language}} of goal-directedness in accounts of evolutionary adaptation, which some biologists and philosophers of science find problematic. The term teleonomy has also been proposed. Teleology is the principle that some phenomena exist because they result in a goal being fulfilled. Before Darwin, organisms were seen as existing because God had designed and created them; their features such as eyes were taken by natural theology to have been made to enable them to carry out their functions, such as seeing. Evolutionary biologists often use similar teleological formulations that invoke purpose, but these imply natural selection rather than actual goals, whether conscious or not. Dissenting biologists and religious thinkers held that evolution itself was somehow goal-directed (orthogenesis), and in vitalist versions, driven by a <b>purposeful</b> life force. Since such views are now discredited, with evolution working by natural selection acting on inherited variation, the use of teleology in biology has attracted criticism, and {{attempts have been made to}} teach students to avoid teleological language.|$|E
5|$|Because A Trip to the Moon {{preceded the}} {{development}} of narrative film editing by filmmakers such as Edwin S. Porter and D. W. Griffith, it does not use the cinematic vocabulary to which American and European audiences later became accustomed, a vocabulary built on the <b>purposeful</b> use of techniques such as varied camera angles, intercutting, juxtapositions of shots, and other filmic ideas. Rather, each camera setup in Méliès's film is designed as a distinct dramatic scene uninterrupted by visible editing, an approach fitting the theatrical style in which the film was designed. Similarly, film scholars have noted that the most famous moment in A Trip to the Moon plays with temporal continuity by showing an event twice: first the capsule is shown suddenly appearing {{in the eye of}} an anthropomorphic moon; then, in a much closer shot, the landing occurs very differently, and much more realistically, with the capsule actually plummeting into believable lunar terrain. This kind of nonlinear storytelling—in which time and space are treated as repeatable and flexible rather than linear and causal—is highly unconventional by the standards of Griffith and his followers; before {{the development of}} continuity editing, however, other filmmakers performed similar experiments with time. (Porter, for instance, used temporal discontinuity and repetition extensively in his 1903 film Life of an American Fireman.) Later in the twentieth century, with sports television's development of the instant replay, temporal repetition again became a familiar device to screen audiences.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} attempt of <b>purposeful</b> espionage against the {{fortress}} {{was conducted in}} 1913–14. A former lieutenant in the Danish coastal artillery, A. B. Fredrikssen, was enlisted in Copenhagen by the Russian military attaché in Stockholm, colonel Assanovitch. Fredrikssen was sent to Boden with the task to explore the fortress and its surroundings. He and his wife stayed at a boarding house in the city, and had regular correspondence with his employer who stayed in Copenhagen. It was also the correspondence that exposed the attempt, which was not very successful in terms of information gained by the Russians. They had better luck in late 1914 with two brothers named Hiukka, who both served {{with one of the}} artillery regiments in Boden, Norrland Artillery Regiment. They were discovered due to their extravagant living, and it was found out that one of the brothersdespite his employment in the armyhad Finnish-Russian citizenship. They had provided intelligence to Russia, but {{the full extent of the}} affair was never disclosed. A minor case of German espionage was exposed during the Second World War. The first permanently stationed German officer in Luleå, a Hauptmann Schultz, was caught photographing parts of the fortifications and was deported. It is probable that his espionage was not ordered from any higher command but was an act on own initiative.|$|E
25|$|Mortar Troop was {{equipped}} with 81mm mortars and consisted of a headquarters section and three <b>purposeful</b> sections (two mortars per section). Assault Pioneer Troop provided the Battalion with combat engineering capabilities through a headquarters section and three <b>purposeful</b> sections. Anti-Tank Troop {{was equipped}} with six 106mm recoilless rifles, and also consisted of a headquarters section and three <b>purposeful</b> sections (two anti-tank weapons per section, each mounted on a modified Rodef 2.5). The remnants of Tracking Troop, with additional resources for reconnoitering, were {{the basis for the}} fourth troop: Reconnaissance Troop.|$|E
25|$|<b>Purposeful</b> Force: {{application}} of naval force {{to change the}} policy or character of the target government or group.|$|E
25|$|<b>Purposeful</b> {{production}} of alcoholic drinks is common and often reflects {{cultural and religious}} peculiarities as much as geographical and sociological conditions.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} disputed phenomena, {{there are a}} number of {{potential}} explanations to cattle mutilations, ranging from death by natural causes to <b>purposeful</b> acts by unknown individuals.|$|E
25|$|The Homestead {{strike was}} {{organized}} and <b>purposeful,</b> {{a harbinger of}} the type of strike which marked the modern age of labor relations in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Teleological {{argument}} – Argues {{that there}} is a <b>purposeful</b> design in the world around us, and a design requires a designer. Cicero, William Paley, and Michael Behe use this argument as well as others.|$|E
25|$|Given the CIA's <b>purposeful</b> {{destruction}} of most records, {{its failure to}} follow informed consent protocols with thousands of participants, the uncontrolled nature of the experiments, {{and the lack of}} follow-up data, the full impact of MKUltra experiments, including deaths, may never be known.|$|E
25|$|Neither Calvin nor Viret {{advocated}} reckless martyrdom or <b>purposeful</b> public disturbance, but to {{the extent}} possible, to make public choices with “Christian modesty,” even recommending that leaving an area (self-imposed exile) is sometimes the most realistic response to persecution when resources permit.|$|E
25|$|Voluntariness {{includes}} omission, for {{implicit in}} omission {{is that the}} actor voluntarily chose to not perform a bodily movement and, consequently, caused an injury. The <b>purposeful,</b> reckless, or negligent absence of an action is considered a voluntary action and fulfills the voluntary requirement of actus reus.|$|E
25|$|Ocean {{fertilization}} or {{ocean nourishment}} {{is a type}} of climate engineering based on the <b>purposeful</b> introduction of nutrients to the upper ocean to increase marine food production and to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. A number of techniques, including fertilization by iron, urea and phosphorus have been proposed.|$|E
25|$|Even in {{the decades}} before fission weapons, there had been {{speculation}} about the possibility for human beings to end all life on the planet, either by accident or <b>purposeful</b> maliciousness—but technology had not provided the capacity for such action. The great power of hydrogen bombs made worldwide annihilation possible.|$|E
25|$|Apraxia {{of speech}} (AOS) is an {{acquired}} oral motor speech disorder affecting an individual's ability to translate conscious speech plans into motor plans, {{which results in}} limited and difficult speech ability. By the definition of apraxia, AOS affects volitional (willful or <b>purposeful)</b> movement patterns, however AOS usually also affects automatic speech.|$|E
25|$|Noncooperation {{involves}} the <b>purposeful</b> withholding of cooperation or the unwillingness to initiate {{in cooperation with}} an opponent. The goal of noncooperation is to halt or hinder an industry, political system, or economic process. Methods of noncooperation include labour strikes, economic boycotts, civil disobedience, sex strike, tax refusal, and general disobedience.|$|E
25|$|The final cause (telos) is its purpose, or {{that for}} the sake of which a thing exists or is done, {{including}} both <b>purposeful</b> and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve. This covers modern ideas of motivating causes, such as volition, need, desire, ethics, or spiritual beliefs.|$|E
25|$|Article 200 was <b>purposeful</b> to Ceaușescu {{regime in}} that, since 1970, it offered a pry to {{strengthen}} social control. These restrictions under the Penal Code were strictly unique to Romania {{and no other}} European country. The restrictions only included relationships and those who considered themselves homosexual were not punished but were instead considered as mentally ill.|$|E
25|$|As most {{fishing boats}} were <b>purposeful</b> heavy working boats built for {{capacity}} of haul and stability, and further {{loaded down with}} heavy damp fishing equipment, those who operated as pilots needed {{a new type of}} boat. Early pilot boats were developed from single masted fishing cutter designs and twin masted yawls and latterly into the specialist pilot cutter.|$|E
25|$|Hyperkinesia, more {{specifically}} chorea, is the hallmark symptom of Huntington's disease, formerly {{referred to as}} Huntington’s chorea. Appropriately, chorea {{is derived from the}} Greek word, khoros, meaning “dance.” The extent of the hyperkinesia exhibited in the disease can vary from solely the little finger to the entire body, resembling <b>purposeful</b> movements but occurring involuntarily. In children, rigidity and seizures are also symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Classical Latin poets {{also used}} Phoebus as a byname for the sun-god, whence come common {{references}} in later European poetry to Phoebus and his car ("chariot") {{as a metaphor}} for the sun. But in particular instances in myth, Apollo and Helios are distinct. The sun-god, the son of Hyperion, with his sun chariot, though often called Phoebus ("shining") is not called Apollo except in <b>purposeful</b> non-traditional identifications.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th {{century the}} potency of the {{influence}} of Wren's work on English architecture was reduced. The last major architect who admitted to being dependent on him was Sir Edwin Lutyens, who died in 1944. With the <b>purposeful</b> elimination of historic influences from international architecture in the early 20th century, Wren's work gradually stopped being perceived as a mine of examples applicable to contemporary design.|$|E
25|$|The {{title of}} the short-story {{collection}} Everything That Rises Must Converge by Flannery O'Connor is a reference to Teilhard's work. The American novelist Don DeLillo's 2010 novel Point Omega borrows its title {{and some of its}} ideas from Teilhard de Chardin. Robert Wright, in his book , compares his own naturalistic thesis that biological and cultural evolution are directional and, possibly, <b>purposeful,</b> with Teilhard's ideas.|$|E
25|$|The {{water level}} of Lough Derg had broken all {{previous}} records by 26 November. This caused the <b>purposeful</b> release of more water downstream which subsequently flooded these areas by around 10 more centimetres of water. Further evacuations {{took place in}} County Clare {{and the city of}} Limerick. The Irish Army continued to patrol Ennis. Waters continued to rise in County Galway as well at this time.|$|E
25|$|Visually the car {{was quite}} different. The {{bodywork}} was now rectangular in cross section and spanned the full width over the wheels. Although actually higher, this increased width {{gave the impression of}} a much lower and sleeker car, accentuated by the long stabilising tailfin and the <b>purposeful</b> raised ridges over the engine camboxes. This Blue Bird was clearly a design of the Modernist '30s, not the brute heroism of the '20s.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{comes from}} a sketch said to be from 1534 and attributed to Gian Giacomo Caprotti, a pupil of Leonardo da Vinci. In 1998 Hans-Erhard Lessing described this as a <b>purposeful</b> fraud. However, {{the authenticity of the}} bicycle sketch is still vigorously maintained by followers of Prof. Augusto Marinoni, a lexicographer and philologist, who was entrusted by the Commissione Vinciana of Rome with the transcription of da Vinci's Codex Atlanticus.|$|E
25|$|The {{final result}} was a chapel, {{complete}} with its unornamented yellow stock brick walls, a tall, eye-catching yet gracefully simple steeple, and simple botanically accurate rose windows, created a dramatic but tasteful and <b>purposeful</b> piece; one that epitomised its low gothic nondenominational function well, whilst establishing Abney Park as a local landmark visible from the thoroughfares of Church Street and the High Street, and from Woodberry Downs in the middle distance.|$|E
25|$|The laws of negiah are {{typically}} followed by Orthodox Jews, with {{varying levels of}} observance. Some Orthodox Jews follow the laws with strict modesty and take measures to avoid accidental contact, such as avoiding sitting next {{to a member of}} the opposite sex on a bus, airplane, or other similar seating situation. Others are more lenient, only avoiding <b>purposeful</b> contact. Adherents of Conservative and Reform Judaism do not follow these laws.|$|E
