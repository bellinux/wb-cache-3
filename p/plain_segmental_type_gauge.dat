40|$|A 53 -year-old Japanese female was {{admitted}} to our hospital for examination and treatment of an abdominal mass lesion. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a well-circumscribed mass that measured approximately 5 cm. Although the tumor was located near {{the neck of the}} gallbladder, it seemed to be pedunculated from the liver parenchyma. From the enhancement pattern and morphological characteristics of the contrast CT images, the nodule was preoperatively diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient underwent a laparotomy, and it was intraoperatively revealed that the tumor existed solely in the neck of the gallbladder without serosal invasion. Whole-layer cholecystectomy with lymph node dissection was therefore performed. A pathological examination revealed that the papillary tumor filled up the neck side lumen of the <b>segmental</b> <b>type</b> of adenomyomatosis (ADM). The tumor was histologically diagnosed as papillary adenocarcinoma. Cases of papillary adenocarcinoma arising on the neck side lumen of the <b>segmental</b> <b>type</b> of ADM are extremely rare. Furthermore, no such case of gallbladder cancer which mimicked hepatocellular carcinoma has previously been reported...|$|R
30|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of GA is {{not fully}} understood: an association with gallbladder stones and chronic inflammatory changes has been highlighted in many studies [1, 5, 10 – 13], but a correlation with acquired wall motility {{as a consequence of}} increased endoluminal pressure has also been postulated [14, 15]. GA is a benign lesion as the hyperplastic epithelium of GA has no higher neoplastic potential than that of a normal gallbladder, even though gallbladder carcinoma may also arise in association with GA [16]. Some studies have shown an increase in gallbladder cancer prevalence among patients with <b>segmental</b> <b>type</b> adenomyomatosis compared to patients without GA or with other patterns of GA, in particular, in the elderly. However, these results may have been influenced by the higher prevalence of cholecystolithiasis in patients affected by <b>segmental</b> <b>type</b> GA, which represents a well-known risk factor for gallbladder carcinoma [10 – 13, 16]. GA may increase in size over time and this change by itself must not be considered an index of malignancy [17]. Patients affected by GA are usually asymptomatic. When present, symptoms may include right upper quadrant pain, possibly also {{as a consequence of the}} presence of gallbladder stones.|$|R

30|$|There are no universally {{accepted}} guidelines for GA management.

In any case, the surgical option might be considered in patients with <b>segmental</b> <b>type</b> GA, given its higher association with gallbladder cancer, and in patients with diffuse GA, given the possible difficulties in identifying neoplastic foci within the wall thickening [18].|$|R

40|$|Background: Segmental {{vitiligo}} and generalized vitiligo are {{in general}} considered separate entities. However, clinico-epidemiological data on segmental vitiligo are scarce {{compared with those}} of generalized vitiligo. Objective: To analyse the clinical profile and distribution pattern of lesions in segmental vitiligo patients. Methods: Segmental vitiligo patients were examined and questioned in a prospective and retrospective setting. The distribution and extent of the lesions were evaluated using clinical photographs. Results: Different phenotypes of segmental vitiligo were found, including the unilateral <b>segmental</b> <b>type</b> (124 patients; group 1), the bilateral <b>segmental</b> <b>type</b> (three patients; group 2) and the mixed <b>segmental</b> and generalized <b>type</b> (14 patients; group 3). Furthermore, lesions were present with (10 %) or without associated halo naevi. The age of onset of segmental vitiligo (median 14 years) was significantly different between the three subgroups (P = 0. 028). Extensive involvement of segmental vitiligo lesions on trunk and extremities was significantly (P = 0. 031) more observed in patients with a lower age of onset, while the generalized vitiligo lesions in the mixed vitiligo group were mostly very mild. Associated autoimmune diseases were reported in 11 %, whereas a positive family history for vitiligo was present in 14. 9 % of patients. Lesions were not strictly dermatomal nor Blaschkolinear, although a typical recurring pattern could be observed. Conclusion: Our data provide clinical evidence that segmental vitiligo and generalized vitiligo are parts of the same disease spectrum and that segmental vitiligo could have a polygenetic background as well. Whether different aetiopathological mechanisms underlie the different clinical phenotypes of segmental vitiligo remain to be elucidated...|$|R
40|$|Fenestration {{refers to}} the {{localized}} duplication of a vessel. Vascular abnormalities are divided into two main configurations: (1) duplications, which have a relatively large arterial window, and (2) arterial slits, which {{are assumed to be}} intraluminal defects. 1 Duplications can be subdivided into either partial or <b>segmental</b> <b>types</b> and either true or complete types. The basilar artery is formed by the fusion of the plexiform, primitive, longitudinal neural arteries in the craniocaudal direction by approximately the 5 th fetal week. 2 Duplication of the basilar artery can result from a failure of the fusion of these embryonic precursors. Both lumens of the fenestrated segments are lined by endothelial tissue and are separated by a tunica media, but they can share a common tunica adventitia. Compared with the partial or <b>segmental</b> <b>types,</b> true or complete duplication-type fenestrations are reported to be extremely rare. 3, 4 Only one case report of autopsy findings of duplication-type basilar artery fenestration and associated brainstem infarction has appeared in the literature. 5 In the present article, we present a case of complete duplication-type fenestration of the basilar artery found in a patient with pontine infarction.

40|$|Objective: Cervical OPLL is a {{relatively}} common cause of developing cervical myelopathy or radiculopathy in Asians. Cervical OPLL is sometimes missed in lateral radiography or MRI. In the present study, we analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of cervical OPLL in lateral radiography and MRI compared to CT scan. Methods: This is a retrospective study of forty-six patients who underwent decompressive surgery anteriorly or posteriorly in our institute. All patients were diagnosed with cervical OPLL by CT scan. The patients were grouped into continuous <b>type,</b> <b>segmental</b> <b>type,</b> mixed type, and localized type. We then evaluated lateral radiographs and MRI compared to CT scans. The diagnostic accuracy and false negative rates in lateral radiograph and MRI were evaluated. Results: In a total of 46 patients diagnosed with cervical OPLL in CT scans, diagnostic accuracy using lateral radiograph and MRI were 52. 2 % (24 / 46) and 58. 7 % (27 / 46), respectively. In the continuous type group, diagnostic accuracy using lateral radiograph and MRI were 85. 7 %(6 / 7) and 100. 0 %(7 / 7). In the <b>segmental</b> <b>type</b> group, diagnostic accuracy using lateral radio-graph and MRI were 27. 3 % (6 / 22) and 31. 8 % (7 / 22). In the mixed type group, diagnostic accuracy was 91. 7 % (11 / 12) in lateral radiograph and 83. 3 % (10 / 12) in MRI. In the localized group, diagnostic accuracy was 20. 0 % (1 / 5) in lateral radiograph and 60. 0 % (3 / 5) in MRI. Conclusion: The diagnostic accuracy of cervical OPLL using lateral radiograph and MRI was less than using CT scan.

40|$|In {{enlarging}} the field content of pure Yang-Mills theory to a cutoff dependent matrix valued complex scalar field, we construct a vectorial operator, which {{is by definition}} invariant {{with respect to the}} gauge transformation of the Yang-Mills field and with respect to a Stueckelberg <b>type</b> <b>gauge</b> transformation of the scalar field. This invariant operator converges to the original Yang-Mills field as the cutoff goes to infinity. With the help of cutoff functions, we construct with this invariant a regularized action for the pure Yang-Mills theory.

Since the scalar fields flat measure is invariant under the Stueckelberg <b>type</b> <b>gauge</b> transformation, we obtain a regularized gauge invariant path integral for pure Yang-Mills theory that is mathematically well defined. Moreover, the regularized Ward-Takahashi identities describing the dynamics of the gauge fields are exactly the same as the formal Ward-Takahashi identities of the unregularized theory...|$|R
