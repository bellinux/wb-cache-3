40|$|WO 200275824 A UPAB: 20030111 NOVELTY - To {{produce an}} adaptronic micro system, {{one or more}} piezo {{electric}} fiber transducers (2) are embedded in a polymer matrix (1), {{with one or more}} <b>control</b> <b>units</b> (3) to <b>control</b> and/or carry signals. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are fitted into the matrix by an initial loose mounting on a surface of a transfer carrier (4). The transfer carrier is applied to the matrix, with the surface fitted with <b>control</b> <b>units</b> towards the transducers, and the transfer carrier is peeled off. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - To produce an adaptronic micro system, the transfer carrier is a film, sheet or plate, with an adhesive bond to hold the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> at a surface, with a weaker bonding than the bond between the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> and the matrix. The bonds are modified to hold the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> more strongly at the matrix. When the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are in place at the matrix, the matrix and/or the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are given an intermediate hardening. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are applied to the transfer carrier by a printing process, ink jet printing or by dispensing. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are electrodes, in an inter-digital array, or of an electrically conductive adhesive applied to the transfer carrier and treated with radiation or heat to give a total or partial hardening action. The transfer carrier, with the control electrodes, is pressed mechanically against the matrix, which is then wholly or partially hardened by radiation or heat. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> can be of conductive film or foil materials, conductive lines or network or grid, or of an intrinsic or extrinsic electrically conductive material. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> can also be light waveguides. The transducers are piezo electric, magnetostrictive, shape memory alloys or nano tubes. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are applied with a direct contact on the transducers. The control connectors, or connectors which can be fitted, are applied by one or more transfer carriers like the <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> application. The transfer carrier is a polymer film, a sheet of felt paper or coated paper. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are wholly embedded in the matrix. A number of micro systems (5) are assembled into a stack, and then fully hardened by mechanical pressure and heat. USE - The process is for the production of adaptronic micro systems. ADVANTAGE - The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are wholly embedded in the matrix, for the production of prepreg modules...|$|R
