Disorders of glycolysis can be detected by various means, including the measurement of lactate after exercise; a failure of the lactate to rise may be indicative of a disorder in glycolysis, while an exaggerated response is typical of mitochondrial diseases.

As a result, they hypothesized that the Csal_ 1534 protein functions as fructose-bisphosphatase, rather than as PFK. The genome annotation of H. smyrnensis AAD 6 T presented Peg. 1123 as PFK and also failed to identify the presence of any fructose-bisphosphatase.

Results: We solved the crystal structure at 2. 3 Å resolution of an ADP-dependent glucokinase from T. litoralis (tlGK) complexed with ADP. The overall structure can be divided into large and small α/β domains, and the ADP molecule is buried in a shallow pocket in the large domain. Unexpectedly, the structure was similar to those of two ATP-dependent kinases, ribokinase and adenosine kinase. Comparison based on three-dimensional structure revealed that several motifs important both in structure and function are conserved, and the recognition of the α- and β-phosphate of the ADP in the tlGK was almost identical with the recognition of the β- and γ-phosphate of ATP in these ATP-dependent kinases. Conclusions: Noticeable points of our study are the first structure of ADP-dependent kinase, the structural similarity to members of the ATP-dependent ribokinase family, its rare nucleotide specificity caused by a shift in nucleotide binding position by one phosphate unit, and identification of the residues that discriminate ADP- and ATP-dependence.

Pfk- 2, an ATPdependent 6 -phosphofructokinase member of the ribokinase-like superfamily, is a homodimer of 66 kDa subunits whose oligomerization state is necessary for catalysis and stability. The presence of MgATP favors the tetrameric form of the enzyme. In this work, we describe the structure of Pfk- 2 in its inhibited tetrameric form, with each subunit bound to two ATP molecules and two Mg ions. The present structure indicates that substrate inhibition occurs due to the sequential binding of two MgATP molecules per subunit, the first at the usual site occupied by the nucleotide in homologous enzymes and the second at the allosteric site, making a number of direct and Mg-mediated interactions with the first. Two configurations are observed for the second MgATP, one of which involves interactions with Tyr 23 from the adjacent subunit in the dimer and the other making an unusual non- Watson-Crick base pairing with the adenine in the substrate ATP. The oligomeric state observed in the crystal is tetrameric, and some of the structural elements involved in the binding of the substrate and allosteric ATPs are also participating in the dimer–dimer interface.

In this work we study the effect of Mg 2 + and phosphate ions on Pfk- 2 activity and the involvement of residue E 190 from the NXXE motif in this behavior. The kinetic data are in agreement with the requirement of a Mg 2 + ion, besides the one present in the metal-nucleotide complex, for catalysis in the wild-type enzyme. Since the response to free Mg 2 + concentration is greatly affected in the E 190 Q mutant, we conclude that this residue is required for the proper binding of the catalytic Mg 2 + ion at the active site. The E 190 Q mutant presents a 50 -fold decrease in the kcat value and a 15 -fold increment in the apparent Km for MgATP 2 -. Inorganic phosphate, typically considered an activator of adenosine kinases, ribokinases, and <b>phosphofructokinases</b> (nonhomologous to Pfk- 2) acted as an inhibitor of wild-type and E 190 Q mutant Pfk- 2. We suggest that phosphate can bind to the allosteric site of Pfk- 2, producing an inhibition pattern qualitatively similar to MgATP 2 -, which can be reversed to some extent by increasing the concentration of fructose- 6 -P. Given that the E 190 Q mutant presents alterations in the inhibition by MgATP 2 - and phosphate, we conclude that the E 190 residue has a role not only in catalysis but also in allosteric regulation.
