This protein, like other neurexin proteins, contains epidermal growth factor repeats and laminin G domains. In addition, it includes an F5/8 type C domain, discoidin/neuropilin- and fibrinogen-like domains, thrombospondin N-terminal-like domains and a putative PDZ binding site. This protein is localized at the juxtaparanodes of myelinated axons and associated with potassium channels.

To achieve this, the so-called <b>positional</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>gene</b> approach is gaining in importance. This approach is based on the genetic localization of a trait using genetic linkage analysis. Subsequent comparative mapping of the trait locus with the gene-rich maps of the human and the mouse may reveal candidate genes for the trait in question. Comparative mapping revealed that autosomal dwarfism in the chicken (adw) is located in a chromosomal region that is conserved between chicken, human and mouse. In the mouse the phenotype [...] "Pygmy", similar to chicken adw is also located in that region. The Pygmy mouse phenotype arises from the inactivation of the High Mobility Group I-C (HMGCI-C). In the human the HMGCI-C gene is also located in the same conserved chromosomal segment. Fluorescent in situ hybridization of chicken metaphase chromosomes using the chicken HMGI-C gene as a probe, showed that the chicken HMGI-C gene is indeed located in the region of the adw locus. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is another candidate for adw in the chicken.|$|E

The identification of genes involved in autism {{is expected to}} increase our understanding of its pathogenesis. Infrequently, neurodevelopmental disorders like autism are associated with chromosomal anomalies. To identify <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> for autism, we initiated a positional cloning strategy starting from individuals with idiopathic autism carrying a de novo chromosomal anomaly. We report on the clinical, cytogenetic and molecular findings in a male person with autism, no physical abnormalities and normal IQ, carrying a de novo balanced paracentric inversion 46, XY, inv(10) (q 11. 1; q 21. 3). The distal breakpoint disrupts the TRIP 8 gene, which codes for a protein predicted to be a transcriptional regulator associated with nuclear thyroid hormone receptors. However, no link between thyroid gland and autism has been reported so far. In addition, the same breakpoint abolishes expression of a nearby gene, REEP 3, through a position effect. Receptor Expression-Enhancing Proteins (REEP) 3 is one of the six human homologs of yeast Yop 1 p, a probable regulator of cellular vesicle trafficking between the endoplasmatic reticulum and the Golgi network.

The {{purpose of this article is}} to investigate the performance of 3 <b>positional</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>gene</b> software tools available, PosMed, GeneSniffer and SUSPECTS. The comparison was made for 40, 20 and 10 Mb regions in the human genome centred around known susceptibility genes for the common diseases breast cancer, Crohn 2 ̆ 7 s disease, age-related macular degeneration and schizophrenia. The known susceptibility gene was not always ranked highly, or not ranked at all, by 1 or more of the software tools. There was a large variation between the 3 tools regarding which genes were prioritized, and their rank order. PosMed and GeneSniffer were most similar in their prioritization gene list, whereas SUSPECTS identified the same candidate genes only for the narrowest (10 Mb) regions. Combining 2 or all of the candidate gene finding tools was superior in terms of ranking positional candidates. It is possible to reduce the number of candidate genes from a starting set in a region of interest by combining a variety of candidate gene finding tools. Conversely, we recommend caution in relying solely on single <b>positional</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>gene</b> prioritization tools. Our results confirm the obvious, that is, that starting with a narrower positional region gives a higher likelihood that the true susceptibility gene is selected, and that it is ranked highly. A narrow confidence interval for the mapping of complex trait genes by linkage can be achieved by maximizing marker informativeness and by having large samples. Our results suggest that the best approach to classify a minimum set of candidate genes is to take those genes that are prioritized by multiple prioritization tools...|$|E

Results Different patterns of transcription regulation in the two rat models of diabetes likely underlie the roles of genetic variants and hyperglycaemia severity. The impact of prolonged hyperglycaemia on gene expression changes was more profound in STZ-WKY rats than in GK rats and involved largely different sets of genes.

Furthermore, a SNP genome-wide association study with ELOVL 6 relative expression levels in backfat showed the strongest effect on the SSC 8 region in which the ELOVL 6 gene is located. Finally, different potential genomic regions associated with ELOVL 6 gene expression were also identified by GWAS in liver and muscle, suggesting a differential tissue regulation of the ELOVL 6 gene. [br/] Our results suggest ELOVL 6 as a potential causal gene for the QTL analyzed and, subsequently, for controlling the overall balance of fatty acid composition in pigs...|$|E
40|$|Background: Preeclampsia is {{a serious}} {{pregnancy}} complication, demonstrating a complex pattern of inheritance. The elucidation of genetic liability to preeclampsia remains a major challenge in obstetric medicine. We have adopted a positional cloning approach to identify maternal genetic components, with linkages previously demonstrated to chromosomes 2 q, 5 q and 13 q in an Australian/New Zealand familial cohort. The current study aimed to identify potential functional and structural variants in the <b>positional</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>gene</b> TNFSF 13 B under the 13 q linkage peak and assess their association status with maternal preeclampsia genetic susceptibility. Methodology/Principal Findings: The proximal promoter and coding regions of the <b>positional</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>gene</b> TNFSF 13 B residing within the 13 q linkage region was sequenced using 48 proband or founder individuals from Australian/New Zealand families. Ten sequence variants (nine SNPs and one single base insertion) were identified and seven SNPs were successfully genotyped in the total Australian/New Zealand family cohort (74 families/ 480 individuals). Borderline association to preeclampsia (p = 0. 0153) was observed for three rare SNPs (rs 16972194, rs 16972197 and rs 56124946) in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other. Functional evaluation by electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed differential nuclear factor binding to the minor allele of the rs 16972194 SNP, residing upstream of the translation start site, making this a putative functional variant. The observed genetic associations were not replicated in a Norwegian case/ control cohort (The Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT 2), 851 preeclamptic and 1, 440 non-preeclamptic women). Conclusion/Significance: TNFSF 13 B has previously been suggested {{to contribute to the}} normal immunological adaption crucial for a successful pregnancy. Our observations support TNFSF 13 B as a potential novel preeclampsia susceptibility gene. We discuss a possible role for TNFSF 13 B in preeclampsia pathogenesis, and propose the rs 16972194 variant as a candidate for further functional evaluation. © 2010 Fenstad et al.

40|$|Cardiovascular malformations and {{cardiomyopathy}} {{are among}} the most common phenotypes caused by deletions of chromosome 1 p 36 which affect approximately 1 in 5000 newborns. Although these cardiac-related abnormalities are a significant source of morbidity and mortality associated with 1 p 36 deletions, most of the individual genes that contribute to these conditions have yet to be identified. In this paper, we use a combination of clinical and molecular cytogenetic data to define five critical regions for cardiovascular malformations and two critical regions for cardiomyopathy on chromosome 1 p 36. <b>Positional</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> which may {{contribute to the development of}} cardiovascular malformations associate...|$|R

Four <b>positional</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>genes</b> suspected to alter bone development {{have been identified}} and are under analysis. A causative mutation {{was found in the}} PRKG 2 gene. Subsequently, a genetic test was developed so that Angus breeders may select against dwarfism. This test successfully predicted which calves were dwarves with 100 % accuracy in a breeding experiment recently concluded at Iowa State. Preliminary data in cell culture indicates that the mutation discovered changes the function of the PRKG 2 gene, strongly suggesting it is the causative mutation in American Angus...|$|R
40|$|Dominant {{intermediate}} Charcot-Marie-Tooth (DI-CMT) neuropathy is {{a genetic}} and phenotypic variant of classical CMT, characterized by intermediate nerve conduction velocities and histological evidence of both axonal and demyelinating features. We report two unrelated families with intermediate CMT {{linked to a}} novel locus on chromosome 1 p 34 -p 35 (DI-CMTC). The combined haplotype analysis in both families localized the DI-CMTC gene within a 6. 3 -cM linkage interval flanked by markers D 1 S 2787 and D 1 S 2830.
