5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, Maryland's economy was {{suffering}} {{from the effects of}} <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> on the world market of its main cash crop, tobacco. Often in those years, the price on world markets was barely above the cost of production, leaving planters with little to show for their efforts. This affected small Protestant planters disproportionately, as many of the larger Catholic landowners had diversified economically. This growing socioeconomic inequality exacerbated underlying religious tensions. Furthermore, the new Governor, William Joseph, who arrived in the colony just before Carroll, immediately entered into an adversarial relationship with the Protestant-dominated lower house of the assembly. Into this powder keg came the news that England's Glorious Revolution had taken place; the Catholic King James II had been deposed and replaced with the Protestant William of Orange. In an attempt to maintain control in the colony, Governor Joseph quickly canceled the session of the colonial assembly scheduled for April 1689.|$|E

We show that the future cash flows of a security subject to price limit regulation resemble that of a distinctive contingent claim. Assuming that the security price follows a lognormal distribution, we use the risk-neutral valuation relation (RNVR) developed by [4] to derive the security valuation, {{in the presence of}} <b>price</b> <b>fluctuation</b> limits.

40|$|<b>Price</b> <b>fluctuation</b> is a {{practice}} commonly used by companies to stimulate demand and a {{main cause of}} the Bullwhip effect. Assuming a staggered step demand pattern that responds elastically to retailer’s <b>price</b> <b>fluctuation,</b> and by using a supply chain management dynamic model, we will analyse {{the impact of these}} fluctuations on the variability of the orders placed along a traditional multilevel supply chain. Subsequently, the results obtained will serve to propose a forecasting model enabling to calculate the potential variability of orders placed by each echelon {{on the basis of the}} price pattern used. Finally, under the hypothesis of an environment of collaboration between the different members of the chain, we propose a predictive model that makes it possible to quantify the distortion of the orders generated by each level.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to explore the influence of <b>price</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in the international grain market on fish feedstuff and on the local price of milkfish by constructing the DCC-GARCH model through an empirical research method based on setting the price of soybean flour and the local price of milkfish as the main variants. As shown in the statistical result, it is found that the <b>price</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in the international grain market exerts a positive direct and indirect passing effect on the raw material price of feedstuff and the local price of milkfish, while a bi-directional passing effect occurs between the price of milkfish and the price of soybean flour. As for the <b>price</b> <b>fluctuation,</b> there is both a short- and long-term impact between the price of milkfish and soybean flour. Their earlier price will result in a marked influence on their current price in which a bi-directional passing effect will take place as well...|$|R
25|$|These models {{rely on the}} {{assumption}} that asset <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations</b> are the result of a well-behaved random or stochastic process. This is why mainstream models (such as the famous Black-Scholes model) use normal probabilistic distributions to describe price movements. For all practical purposes, extreme variations can be ignored. Mandelbrot thought this was an awful way to look at financial markets. For him, the distribution of price movements is not normal and has the property of kurtosis, where fat tails abound. This is a more faithful representation of financial markets: the movements of the Dow index for the past hundred years reveals a troubling frequency of violent movements. Still, conventional models used {{by the time of the}} 2008 financial crisis ruled out these extreme variations and considered they can only happen every 10,000 years. An obvious conclusion from Mandelbrot’s work is that greater regulation in financial markets is indispensable. Other contributions of his work for the study of stock market behaviour are the creation of new approaches to evaluate risk and avoid unanticipated financial collapses.|$|E
25|$|State {{intervention}} in marketing peasant produce was justified in colonial times as protecting farmers against commodity <b>price</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> However, in ADMARC, development and profit-making were given priority of over price stabilization. At first, ADMARC accumulated substantial profits and re-invested {{them in a}} range of private companies and statutory corporations. Compared to those its neighbours Tanzania, Zambia, and later Mozambique and Zimbabwe, Malawi’s parastatal bodies were less bureaucratic and aimed to be business-like and profitable. In particular, its ADMARC was considered efficient until 1980. With an economic decline {{at the start of the}} 1980s, the flaws in its strategy became apparent. Profit accumulation had reduced the economic well-being of the peasant producers. The main beneficiaries of this strategy were the political elite who controlled organisations sponsored by ADMARC, the urban population obtaining subsidised food and the employees of ADMARC and other state bodies. Transferring resources away from smallholders to the state led to corruption and abuse of office. In 1977, a long serving ADMARC chairman was convicted for misusing corporation property in his private businesses and of making large unauthorised loans to a private company in which he and family were involved. Corruption and general inefficiency in statutory corporations including ADMARC resulted in a 1980 law limiting their holding office for a renewable two year period. This was not followed by any change in ADMARC's business activities or its conflicting roles as a marketing organization and provider of development finance.|$|E
