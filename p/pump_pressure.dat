5|$|The {{incident}} allowed Jani to {{move into}} the lead but di Grassi stopped at Farm Curve with a motor generator unit problem shortly afterwards. His team's mechanics were allowed to tend to the Audi after travelling via a course car, extending the full course yellow as it was tended to. Di Grassi's race ended prematurely and one of the mechanics used a fire extinguisher to extinguish smoke bellowing from his car. The race resumed after 23 minutes with Tréluyer attacking Lieb, and upon being delayed by the No. 13 Rebellion Racing car, passed him {{to move into}} the lead on the approach to Maggots corner and pulled away on the Hangar straight. Rast stopped at the entrance of Maggots corner with a fuel <b>pump</b> <b>pressure</b> failure, causing him to lose the LMP2 lead to Watts and rejoined the field in third place in class. Rast recovered and passed Senna for second in LMP2 by using the grass at Stowe corner. Tréluyer was blocked by slower traffic allowing Lieb to close up to him on the Wellington straight. Lieb could not overtake because he was delayed by a pack of LMP2 cars. Rast closed up to Watts and overtook him to retake the LMP2 lead. Tréluyer and Lieb ran closely between each other before the former pulled away from Lieb.|$|E

25|$|In {{personalized}} tourniquet instruments, {{the internal}} electrical <b>pump,</b> <b>pressure</b> display, and pressure regulator are combined {{in a single}} instrument in which a microprocessor continuously monitors and compensates for changing levels of pressure in the cuff bladder. Regulation does not rely on mechanical (pressure) forces to turn valves off and on. Instead, the microprocessor can detect extremely small changes in the cuff pressure and automatically regulate the flow of gas to control the pressure.|$|E
30|$|When {{the face}} cleat was {{parallel}} to the maximum horizontal principle stress (Fig.  6 a), {{a large amount of}} fracturing fluid was injected into the simulated wellbore. The <b>pumping</b> <b>pressure</b> increased gradually and dropped suddenly when the breakdown pressure was reached, that is, the peak of the <b>pumping</b> <b>pressure</b> curve. A strong energy release was generated at the moment of initiation and a main fracture was formed in the specimen. Subsequently, frequent small fluctuations occurred on the curve, which is due to the formation of some internal branch fractures intersected with the main fracture or connected with the cleats, forming a diversion channel for fracturing fluid (Guo et al. 2014). Since there was a balance between injection and infiltration of the fracturing fluid, the overall <b>pumping</b> <b>pressure</b> curve maintained a relatively stable state.|$|R
30|$|Common {{water-based}} {{fracturing fluid}} with chemical additives is pumped at high rate and pressure into the formation during hydraulic fracturing process. When the <b>pumping</b> <b>pressure</b> exceeds {{the strength of}} the formation rock, fractures are induced and propagated into the formation, and then the propping agent is pumped into the fractures to keep them from closing after <b>pumping</b> <b>pressure</b> is released. Therefore, a man-made passage with high conductivity is constructed and hydrocarbon can flow into the well from the low-permeability formation (Economides and Nolte 2000).|$|R

The various guidelines provided by state governments however, do advise that rain water tanks be {{designed to provide a}} reliable source of water to supplement mains water supply, and maintain appropriate water quality. The use of rainwater tanks should consider issues such as supply and demand, water quality, stormwater benefits (volume is reduced), cost, available space, maintenance, size, shape and material of the tank. Rainwater tanks must also be installed in accordance with plumbing and drainage standards. An advised suitable configuration may include a water filter or first flush diversion, a mains water top-up supply (dual supply system), maintenance drain, a <b>pump</b> (<b>pressure</b> system), and an on-site retention provision.|$|E

Within this range, the [...] hoses are fitted with [...] "Instantaneous Couplings"; the [...] hoses have Storz couplings; and the [...] hose comes in two types, one with [...] "Instantaneous Couplings" [...] and one with Storz fittings. Fire Service Manuals provide tables of maximum volumetric flow rates for a given <b>pump</b> <b>pressure,</b> hose diameter and total hose length.

40|$|Although {{the major}} {{functions}} of the lymphatic system are fairly well defined, its vasculature {{has yet to be}} well characterized in comparison to its blood vasculature counterpart. Recent advances in optical imaging techniques have allowed for more detailed and quantitative evaluations of lymph flow dynamics and mechanism. A rat tail is often used for investigations of lymph flow because of the simple geometry, superficial nature, and disease progression models of its collecting lymphatic vessels. In this study, a pressure cuff system was fabricated and coupled with an existing functional near infrared (NIR) imaging system to measure the overall <b>pumping</b> <b>pressure</b> of the lymphatic vessels of a rat tail. In addition to adapting the system for use on rodents, previous systems used for measuring lymphatic <b>pumping</b> <b>pressure</b> in humans were improved upon in several ways. The system defined here utilizes closed-loop feedback control of pressure application at smaller, more precise intervals. Using this device, a significant difference in lymphatic vessel <b>pumping</b> <b>pressure</b> was detected between a control case and a treatment case in which a vasoactive substance with a nitric oxide donor (GTNO ointment) was applied to the tail. Although it is known that nitric oxide plays a crucial physiologic role in propagation of flow through lymphatic vessels, this study has quantified its significant pharmacological reduction of <b>pumping</b> <b>pressure</b> for the first time.

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{proposed}} to estimate <b>pumping</b> <b>pressure</b> based on concrete composition without experimental measurements. Previous {{studies show that}} the <b>pumping</b> <b>pressure</b> depends on the interface friction between concrete and the wall of the pumping pipes. This friction is determined by the thickness and the rheology of the boundary layer formed at the interface. The latter is mainly formed by water, cement, and fine sand particles which come from concrete. Hence, interface parameters, which are the viscous constant and the interface yield stress, are directly related to concrete composition. In this work, at the first time the interface yield stress model is suggested and validated thanks to an experimental database also carried out in this study with a precision of around 13 %. Then, the pressure estimation method is proposed using the two models to calculate the interface parameters. The validation of the method is carried out basing on the comparison with real measurements on the building site. This method enables the calculation of the <b>pumping</b> <b>pressure</b> with a precision of around 15 %...|$|R
2500|$|The {{bottom part}} of the reactor is {{enclosed}} in a watertight compartment. There is a space between the reactor bottom and the floor. The reactor cavity overpressure protection system consists of steam relief assemblies embedded in the floor and leading to Steam Distributor Headers covered with rupture discs and opening into the Steam Distribution Corridor below the reactor, on level +6. The floor of the corridor contains entrances {{of a large number}} of vertical pipes, leading to the bottoms of the Pressure Suppression Pools ("bubbler" [...] pools) located on levels +3 and +0. In the event of an accident, which was predicted to be at most a rupture of one or two pressure channels, the steam was to be bubbled through the water and condensed there, reducing the overpressure in the leaktight compartment. The flow capacity of the pipes to the pools limited the protection capacity to simultaneous rupture of two pressure channels; a higher number of failures would cause pressure buildup sufficient to lift the cover plate ("Structure E", after the explosion nicknamed [...] "Elena"), sever the rest of the fuel channels, destroy the control rod insertion system, and potentially also withdraw control rods from the core. The containment was designed to handle failures of the downcomers, pumps, and distribution and inlet of the feedwater. The leaktight compartments around the pumps can withstand overpressure of 0.45MPa. The distribution headers and inlets enclosures can handle 0.08MPa and are vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The reactor cavity can handle overpressure of 0.18MPa and is vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The pressure suppression system can handle a failure of one reactor channel, a <b>pump</b> <b>pressure</b> header, or a distribution header. Leaks in the steam piping and separators are not handled, except for maintaining slightly lower pressure in the riser pipe gallery and the steam drum compartment than in the reactor hall. These spaces are also not designed to withstand overpressure. The steam distribution corridor contains surface condensers. The fire sprinkler systems, operating during both accident and normal operation, are fed from the pressure suppression pools through heat exchangers cooled by the plant service water, and cool the air above the pools. Jet coolers are located in the topmost parts of the compartments; their role is to cool the air and remove the steam and radioactive aerosol particles.|$|E

30|$|This study {{presented}} a finger-triggered portable PDMS suction cup that facilitated equipment-free microfluidic pumping. A negative pressure-driven fluid flow {{can be generated}} by a simple finger-triggered operation. The effect of the diameter, thickness, and PDMS mixing ratio of the PDMS suction cup on the pumping performance was investigated. The pumping performance (i.e., <b>pumping</b> <b>pressure</b> and duration time) mainly depended on the restoration force of the deformed PDMS cup, and a trade-off existed between the <b>pumping</b> <b>pressure</b> and the duration time. Equipment-free pumping of thermoplastic-based devices and water-in-oil droplet generation were demonstrated for practical applications. We believe that this pumping method can be extensively utilized for point-of-care diagnostics or resource-limited applications.|$|R

50|$|A {{decrease}} in <b>pump</b> <b>pressure</b> or increase in pump speed can happen {{as a result}} of a {{decrease in}} hydrostatic pressure of the annulus as the formation fluids enters the wellbore. As the lighter formation fluid flows into the wellbore, the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the annular column of fluid decreases, and the drilling fluid in the drill pipe tends to U-tube into the annulus. When this occurs, the <b>pump</b> <b>pressure</b> will drop, and the pump speed willincrease. The lower <b>pump</b> <b>pressure</b> and increase in pump speed symptoms can also be indicative of a hole in the drill string, commonly referred to as a washout. Until a confirmation can be made whether a washout or a well kick has occurred, a kick should be assumed.|$|E

SPP is very important during a well kill operation in which circulation (a process in which drilling fluid is circulated out of the suction pit, down the drill pipe and drill collars, out the bit, up the annulus, {{and back to the}} pits while drilling proceeds) is done at a reduced rate to allow better control of circulating pressures and to enable the mud properties (density and viscosity) to be kept at desired values.
