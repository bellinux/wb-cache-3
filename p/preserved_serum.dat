Over the years, {{research has focused on}} their role in <b>preserving</b> <b>serum</b> levels of the biologically active molecule T 3 during iodine deficiency. More recently, a fascinating new role of these enzymes has been unveiled. The activating deiodinase (D 2) and the inactivating deiodinase (D 3) can locally increase or decrease thyroid hormone signaling in a tissue- and temporal-specific fashion, independent of changes in thyroid hormone serum concentrations. This mechanism is particularly relevant because deiodinase expression can be modulated by a wide variety of endogenous signaling molecules such as sonic hedgehog, nuclear factor-κB, growth factors, bile acids, hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α, as well as a growing number of xenobiotic substances. In light of these findings, it seems clear that deiodinases play a much broader role than once thought, with great ramifications for the control of thyroid hormone signaling during vertebrate development and metamorphosis, as well as injury response, tissue repair, hypothalamic function, and energy homeostasis in adults...|$|R

40|$|Background: KMUP- 1 is a {{xanthine}} derivative with inhibitory {{activities on}} the phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3, 4 and 5 isoenzymes to suppress the degradation of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP. However, the effects of KMUP- 1 on osteoclast differentiation are still unclear. In this study, we investigated whether KMUP- 1 inhibits osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL in RAW 264. 7 cells and bone loss induced by ovariectomy in mice, and the underlying mechanisms. Principal Findings: In vitro, KMUP- 1 inhibited RANKL-induced TRAP activity, the formation of multinucleated osteoclasts and resorption-pit formation. It also inhibited key mediators of osteoclastogenesis including IL- 1 b, IL- 6, TNF-a and HMGB 1. In addition, KMUP- 1 inhibited RANKL-induced activation of signaling molecules (Akt, MAPKs, calcium and NF-kB), mRNA expression of osteoclastogensis-associated genes (TRAP, MMP- 9, Fra- 1, and cathepsin K) and transcription factors (c-Fos and NFATc 1). Furthermore, most inhibitory effects of KMUP- 1 on RANKL-mediated signal activations were reversed by a protein kinase A inhibitor (H 89) and a protein kinase G inhibitor (KT 5823). In vivo, KMUP- 1 prevented loss of bone mineral content, <b>preserved</b> <b>serum</b> alkaline phosphate and reduced serum osteocalcin in ovariectomized mice. Conclusions: KMUP- 1 inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro and protects against ovariectomy-induced bone loss in vivo.

This appeared approximately 35 d {{after a series of}} five booster immunizations. Concurrently, in vitro T cell blastogenic responses were <b>preserved.</b> <b>Serum</b> obtained when the skin tests were nonreactive demonstrated a profound inhibitory activity on T cell reactivity. This activity was shown to be anti-antibody activity that was both anti-F(ab) ' 2 and, specifically, anti-TT F(ab) ' 2. It blocked binding of TT to a pool of allogeneic antibodies and also inhibited allogeneic antigen-specific T cell blastogenesis. Thus, we could identify activity in the serum of hyperimmunized individuals that appeared auto-anti-idiotypic (anti-id) and represented a single or family of major crossreacting idiotypes (id) for TT. The expression of the auto-anti-id correlated with the loss of T cell reactivity in vivo and in vitro. Subsequent examinations revealed persistent, specific cutaneous anergy beyond six months, which was then associated with a failure of T cells to react with antigen in vitro. Mixing experiments with cells from these later times and cryopreserved autologous cells obtained prior to hyperimmunization revealed there had been the development of antigen-specific T suppressor cells. Thus, in vivo DTH tolerance following hyperimmunization was associated with an inhibitory serum activity that appeared to be anti-id.

Despite actual screening programs, about 50 % of the patients are diagnosed at advanced tumor stages presenting poor prognosis. Innovative screening tools could aid the detection at early stages and allow curative treatment interventions. Methods A nine target multiplex serum protein biochip was generated and evaluated using a training- and validation-set of 317 highly standardized, liquid nitrogen <b>preserved</b> <b>serum</b> samples comprising controls, adenomas, and colon cancers. Results Serum levels of CEA, IL- 8, VEGF, S 100 A 11, MCSF, C 3 adesArg, CD 26, and CRP showed significant differences between cases and controls. The largest areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve were observed for CEA, IL- 8, and CRP. At threshold levels yielding 90 % specificity, sensitivities for CEA, IL- 8 and CRP were 26 %, 22 %, and 17 %, respectively. The most promising marker combinations were CEA[*]+[*]IL- 8 reaching 37 % sensitivity at 83 % specificity and CEA[*]+[*]CRP with 35 % sensitivity at 81 % specificity. In an independent validation set CEA[*]+[*]IL- 8 reached 47 % sensitivity at 86 % specificity while CEA[*]+[*]CRP obtained 39 % sensitivity at 86 % specificity. Early carcinomas were detected with 33 % sensitivity for CEA[*]+[*]IL- 8 and 28 % for CEA[*]+[*]CRP.

40|$|Background: The {{clinical}} {{characteristics of}} Takayasu arteritis (TAK) developing in individuals older than 40 years (TAK > 40) are little-known. Method: We retrospectively analyzed 43 patients with TAK treated at three hospitals in Japan from April 2000 to March 2016. From medical records we collected baseline variables at diagnosis including clinical symptoms, laboratory data, and subsequent relapses. We compared these indices in the patients with TAK onset at > 40 {{years of age}} (TAK > 40) to those with TAK onset ≤ 40 years (TAK ≤ 40). Multiplex cytokine/chemokine bead assays were performed using <b>preserved</b> <b>serum</b> supernatants from 24 patients with TAK and 40 healthy donors. Results: Of the 43 patients, 20 had TAK > 40; this group had significantly fewer instances of orthostatic hypotension (2 (10 %) vs. 10 (43 %), p= 0. 019), carotid bruit (7 (35 %) vs. 16 (70 %), p= 0. 034), and chest pain (0 (0 %) vs. 6 (26 %), p= 0. 023) {{compared to patients with}} TAK ≤ 40 (n= 23). The initial prednisolone dose was significantly lower in TAK > 40 (median 30 mg vs. 40 mg per day, p= 0. 024). Assessed by the log-rank test, the relapse-free survival rate after remission was significantly higher in the patients with TAK > 40 (p= 0. 029). The interleukin 17 levels were significantly lower in patients with TAK > 40 compared to patients with TAK ≤ 40 and healthy donors. Conclusion: Compared to TAK ≤ 40, TAK > 40 could be treated by lower initial doses of prednisolone to achieve remission, and with fewer relapses.

In the case of the serum plate agglutination test (SPA), commonly used to detect antibodies for Salmonella Pullorum (SP), Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) and Mycoplasma synoviae (MS), serum cannot be frozen because it may result in false positive. Without freezing, serum can last only for a few days. In this experiment, glycerin was evaluated as a serum preservering agent. About 50 samples for each disease and analyzed by SPA test previously were separated.

Methods: Eighty-three clinically healthy Bernese Mountain dogs and 46 control dogs were included. Antibodies against B. burgdorferi were determined using an ELISA with a whole cell sonicate as antigen. Results were confirmed using Western blot. C 3 was measured using a single radial immunodiffusion test. Results were reported as the percentage concentration of C 3 compared with that in pooled <b>preserved</b> canine <b>serum</b> (100 % C 3 concentration). Results: Median C 3 concentration was 128. 5 % in Bernese Mountain dogs with antibodies against B. burgdorferi, 133. 5 % in B. burgdorferi-negative Bernese Mountain dogs, 87. 8 % in positive control dogs, and 102. 2 % in negative control dogs. Within Bernese Mountain and control groups, C 3 was lower in dogs with antibodies against B. burgdorferi compared with those without. Percentage concentration of C 3 was higher in healthy Bernese Mountain dogs compared with control dogs. Conclusion: Low C 3 concentration is not an explanation for the high prevalence of B. burgdorferi infections and glomerular disease in Bernese Mountain dogs...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} sera from 285 {{patients}} with definite or classical rheumatoid arthritis (including 37 patients receiving no anti-inflammatory drugs) and sera from 67 healthy subjects has confirmed 10 published {{reports of a}} statistically significant decreased blood histidine concentration in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Contrastingly, in sera from 231 patients {{with a variety of}} acute and chronic illnesses other than rheumatoid arthritis, no statistically significant hypohistidinemia was observed either in the group as a whole or in association with the administration of aspirin, prednisone, indomethacin, phenylbutazone, or dextropropoxyphene. In the patients with rheumatoid arthritis there was a statistically significant correlation between the serum histidine concentration and the following: Westergren sedimentation rate (r=- 0. 33, P smaller than 10 - minus 9), grip strength (r= 0. 26, P smaller than 10 - minus 9), hematocrit (r= 0. 23, P smaller than 10 - minus 9), duration of morning stiffness (r=- 0. 14, P= 10 - minus 5), walking time (r=- 0. 13, P= 10 - minus 4), latex titer of rheumatoid factor (r=- 0. 11, P= 0. 001), and the duration of arthritis (r=- 0. 06, P= 0. 05). There was no statistically significant association between the serum histidine concentration and the duration of rheumatoid arthritis in the 151 patients with disease of 0 - 10 -yr duration (r= 0. 02, P= 0. 5), the sex of the patient, or the presence of antinuclear antibody (R= 0. 007, P= 0. 9). The serum histidine concentration was less in rheumatoid patients receiving steroids (P= 0. 00001), gold (P= 0. 009), and aspirin (P= 0. 15) than in rheumatoid patients not receiving these drugs. This study indicates that histidine determinations on properly <b>preserved</b> casual <b>serum</b> samples can be helpful in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and in the evaluation of the activity of the disease...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{activation}} of complement by Sporothrix schenckii yeast cells. Total complement activity, {{and the effect}} of various activators on this activity, were assayed on aliquots of fresh nonimmune human serum with and without prior treatment with chelators. Both total hemolytic complement and C 3 were consumed (activated) in serum chelated with magnesium ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) -N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, which blocks the classical pathway but leaves the alternative pathway intact. Further, C 3 was consumed, but C 4 (exclusively a component of the classical pathway) was <b>preserved,</b> in nonchelated <b>serum</b> after challenge by S. schenckii yeast cells. Absorption of serum with S. schenckii yeast cells to deplete antibodies did not alter these results. Furthermore, immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that C 3, but not immunoglobulin G, was deposited on yeast cells during incubation with nonimmune serum. These data indicate that S. schenckii yeast cells activate the alternative complement pathway in vitro independently of antibody. These data do not define a role for the alternative pathway in in vivo host defenses against infection with this organism but provide a foundation for studies to evaluate such a role...|$|R
40|$|Acute kidney injury {{has a high}} {{mortality}} and lacks specific therapies, with ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) being the predominant cause. Macrophages (Mφ) have been used successfully in cell therapy to deliver targeted therapeutic genes in models of inflammatory kidney disease. Heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) catalyzes heme breakdown and has important cytoprotective functions. We hypothesized that administration of Mφ modified to overexpress HO- 1 would protect from renal IRI. Using an adenoviral construct (Ad-HO- 1), HO- 1 was overexpressed in primary bone marrow–derived Mφ (BMDM). In vitro Ad-HO- 1  Mφ showed an anti-inflammatory phenotype with increased phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (ACs) and increased interleukin (IL) - 10 but reduced TNF-α and nitric oxide (NO) following lipopolysaccharide/interferon-γ (IFNγ) stimulation compared to control transduced or unmodified Mφ. In vivo, intravenously (IV) injected Mφ homed preferentially to the post-IRI kidney compared to uninjured control following experimental IRI. At 24 hours postinjury, despite equivalent levels of tubular necrosis, apoptosis, and capillary density between groups, the injection of Ad-HO- 1 Mφ resulted in <b>preserved</b> renal function (<b>serum</b> creatinine reduced by 46 %), and reduced microvascular platelet deposition. These data demonstrate that genetically modified Mφ improve the outcomes in IRI when administered after the establishment of structural injury, raising the prospect of targeted cell therapy to support {{the function of the}} acutely injured kidney...|$|R
40|$|Aim. The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{incidence}} of early and late cardiotoxicity in women receiving anthracycline antibiotics during breast cancer chemotherapy treatment as well as possible links of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy with endothelial dysfunction and inflammation. Materials and methods. A 12 -month cohort study included 148 women with breast cancer who received anthracycline antibiotics as a part of chemotherapy regimens. Echocardiography and ultrasound examination of the brachial artery were performed in all patients before chemotherapy, after the first round of therapy, and one year after inclusion in the study. Patients were divided into two groups based on the results of a preliminary examination. Group 1 consisted of 34 patients who had developed dysfunction from the 1 st type associated with antitumor chemotherapy, and group 2 was comprised of 114 patients with <b>preserved</b> LVEF. <b>Serum</b> concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) were determined after the end of antineoplastic chemotherapy by ELISA. Results. After one year of combined treatment with anthracyclines, 23 % of breast cancer patients had a depression of global systolic function in the left ventricle (reduction of the ejection fraction by 10 % or more from baseline), which was associated with a change in geometry (an increase in the cavity and a decrease in the relative thickness of the walls). On the one hand, the changes in the structural and functional parameters of the left ventricle were connected with the total dose of doxorubicin and associated with a decrease in the growth of the brachial artery diameter in the reactive hyperemia test. On the other hand, the changes were associated with an increase in serum concentration of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL- 1 β). Conclusions. The incidence of late dysfunction of the first type associated with antitumor chemotherapy for breast cancer is 23 %. Cardiovascular injuries caused by chemotherapy with anthracyclines are dose-dependent and are accompanied by the development of vasomotor dysfunction of the endothelium of the brachial artery. Excess anti-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL- 1 β) in the sera of patients who developed a depression of global left ventricular systolic function in a separated period of antitumor chemotherapy seems to reflect the role of systemic inflammation in the mechanisms of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy development. </p...|$|R
40|$|High {{molecular}} weight biomolecules are becoming {{important in the}} development of new therapeutics. However, their size and nature creates a major limitation for their application – poor penetration through biological membranes. A new class of peptides, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), has shown the capability to transport various macromolecules inside the cells. However, {{there are at least two}} limiting factors for successful application of CPPs: the lack of cell-type specificity and restricted bioavailability resulting from endocytic uptake of CPPs and entrapment in endosomal compartments. This thesis aims at designing delivery vehicles for therapeutic substances. In papers I-III, the CPPs have been rationally modified in order to achieve in vivo selectivity towards cancer cells. The first two papers employ tumor homing peptides as targeting moieties coupled to the N-termini of CPPs. In the third paper, a CPP is C-terminally prolonged with a matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP- 2) specific cleavage site followed by an inactivating amino acid sequence. In tissues overexpressing MMP- 2, i. e. in proximity to cancer, the CPP is activated after proteolytic removal of the inactivating sequence, thus the cargo can be transported inside the cells. In paper IV, several CPPs have been N-terminally modified with a stearyl moiety and applied for the delivery of splice-correcting oligonucleotides. We show that stearyl-TP 10 is as effective in oligonucleotide delivery as Lipofectamine™ 2000. Moreover, stearyl-TP 10 has <b>preserved</b> efficacy in <b>serum</b> and is not toxic to cells. In conclusion, the rational modifications of CPPs greatly potentiate their application in cargo delivery both in vitro and in vivo...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Naltrexone {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a possible treatment of pruritus in cholestasis. These studies were undertaken to evaluate the effect of liver cirrhosis on the plasma time-course of naltrexone. METHODS: A total of 18 patients were investigated: seven migraine patients with normal liver function regarded as controls and 11 patients with liver cirrhosis (six with decompensated disease and five with <b>preserved</b> liver function). <b>Serum</b> levels of naltrexone and of its major active metabolite, 6 beta-naltrexol, were assayed by reversed-phase HPLC analysis. RESULTS: In control subjects, circulating concentrations of naltrexone were always much {{lower than those of}} 6 beta-naltrexol (area under the curve: naltrexone, 200 +/- 97 ng/ml x 24 h; 6 beta-naltrexol, 2467 +/- 730 ng/ml x 24 h, p < 0. 01). In severe cirrhosis serum levels of 6 beta-naltrexol increased more slowly, so that circulating levels of naltrexone during the first 2 - 4 h after drug intake were higher than those of 6 beta-naltrexol (6 beta-naltrexol/naltrexone ratio at 2 h: controls, 10. 91 +/- 4. 80; cirrhosis, 0. 39 +/- 0. 18, p < 0. 01). The area under the curve for naltrexone (1610 +/- 629 ng/ml x 24 h) was significantly greater than in controls, whereas that for 6 beta-naltrexol (2021 +/- 955 ng/ml x 24 h) was not significantly different. Patients with compensated cirrhosis showed an intermediate pattern. No differences in elimination half-life of the two drugs were detected among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest the occurrence of important changes in the systemic availability of naltrexone and 6 beta-naltrexol in liver cirrhosis; such alterations are consistent with lesser reduction of naltrexone to 6 beta-naltrexol and appear {{to be related to the}} severity of liver disease. This must be considered when administering naltrexone in conditions of liver insufficiency...|$|R

This cassette formal test was evaluated first in blind with {{a panel of}} 393 coded serum samples. the Chagas Stat-Pak identified 197 infected (98. 5 % sensitivity) and 183 non-infected individuals (94. 8 % specificity). A second evaluation was performed with 352 sera from four Latin America countries tested independently in each Country, showing a sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 98. 6 %. A third set of tests comparing sera with plasma and eluates from filter paper as well as <b>serum</b> <b>preserved</b> in 50 % glycerol did show identical results as those obtained with serum. This rapid test (15 min) uses one device per sample, does not require refrigeration nor a laboratory structure or specialized skills to be performed, accepts different types of samples and may be stored {{for long periods of}} time for result checking and documentation. These attributes together with the high sensitivity and specificity demonstrated herein, make this test a suitable tool for field studies, small laboratories and emergencies at blood banks in the countryside of endemic areas.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the prevalence of}} low bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporotic fractures in kidney transplantation (KT) patients and determined risk factors associated with osteoporotic fractures. The study was conducted on 191 patients (94 men and 97 women) with first KT for 3 years or more presenting stable and <b>preserved</b> renal function (<b>serum</b> creatinine levels lower than 2. 5 mg/dl). KT patients were on immunosuppressive therapy and the cumulative doses of these drugs were also evaluated. BMD was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at multiple sites (spine, femur and total body). Quantitative ultrasound of the calcaneus (broadband ultrasound attenuation, speed of sound, and stiffness index, SI) was also performed. Twenty-four percent (46) of all patients had either vertebral (29 / 46) or appendicular (17 / 46) fractures. We found osteoporosis and osteopenia in 8. 5 - 13. 4 and 30. 9 - 35. 1 % of KT patients, respectively. Women had more fractures than men. In women, prevalent fractures were associated with diabetes mellitus [OR = 11. 5, 95 % CI (2. 4 - 55. 7) ], time since menopause [OR = 3. 7, 95 % CI (1. 2 - 11. 9) ], femoral neck BMD [OR = 1. 99, 95 % CI (1. 4 - 2. 8) ], cumulative dose of steroids [OR = 1. 1, 95 % CI (1. 02 - 1. 12) ] and low SI [OR = 1. 1, 95 % CI (1. 0 - 1. 2) ]. In men, fractures were associated with lower lumbar spine BMD [OR = 1. 75, 95 % CI (1. 1 - 2. 7) ], lower SI [OR = 1. 1, 95 % CI (1. 03 - 1. 13) ], duration of dialysis [OR = 1. 3, 95 % CI (1. 13 - 2. 7) ], and lower body mass index [OR = 1. 24, 95 % CI (1. 1 - 1. 4). Our results demonstrate high prevalence of low BMD and osteoporotic fractures in patients receiving a successful kidney transplant and indicate the need for specific intervention to prevent osteoporosis in this population.

40|$|Retenção dentária é a condição fisiopatológica em que o dente, uma vez chegado o seu momento fisiológico de erupção, apresenta algum impedimento para realizá-lo. O tratamento, com envolvimento cirúrgico-ortodôntico, visa deslocar o elemento dental para a correta posição na arcada dentária, sem causar danos aos elementos dentais adjacentes, restabelecendo a estética e a função. A colagem direta de botões e braquetes ortodônticos para tração de dentes inclusos transformou-se na técnica preferida, pois exige menor extensão cirúrgica e remoção de tecido para acesso à coroa dental. A pesquisa objetivou analisar a intensidade da força aplicada ao conjunto dente/artifício/fio de amarrilho, pelo tracionamento, e observar o local do rompimento. Utilizaram-se 45 pré-molares, conservados em soro fisiológico 0, 9 %, que foram divididos em 3 grupos (15 com braquetes, 15 com botões e 15 com telas). Os dentes foram fixados em canos de PVC preenchidos com resina acrílica e os acessórios fixados ao dente com resina autopolimerizável. Após a colagem dos acessórios ortodônticos, os dentes voltaram a ser conservados em soro fisiológico e o teste realizado após 72 horas, com a utilização de um sensor de força e um programa de computador (Logger Pro). Com os resultados, observou-se que o braquete resistiu a uma força média de 36, 0 N, sendo a junção fio/braquete o local menos resistente; o botão resistiu a uma força média de 41, 2 N, a junção fio/botão ortodôntico foi o local menos resistente e a tela resistiu a uma força média de 28, 8 N, sendo a junção dente/tela o local menos resistente.
