500|$|... 'Boy' Browning landed by gliders with a {{tactical}} headquarters near Nijmegen. His use of 38 aircraft {{to move his}} corps headquarters on the first lift has been criticised. [...] Half of these gliders carried signal equipment but {{for much of the}} operation he had no contact with either the British 1st Airborne Division at Arnhem or Major General Maxwell D. Taylor's U.S. 101st Airborne Division at Eindhoven. His headquarters had not been envisaged as a frontline unit, and the signals section that had been hastily assembled just weeks before lacked training and experience.

50|$|Western moose do {{not form}} social bonds and only {{come into contact}} to mate or to battle for a mate. Elevated {{testosterone}} levels during mating season mean that bulls may attack anything during mating season, including humans, wolf <b>packs,</b> <b>brown</b> bears, elk, and black bears. They use a subtle mating call to attract females or to announce to other males {{that they are in}} the area. In the event of a fight over mating rights, bull moose risk locking their antlers, which almost always results in them both dying from starvation. Western moose females will have, on average, one or two calves at once. A female may attack if she feels that her calves are threatened, although, at around 10-11 months yearling Western moose are chased off by their mothers to fend for themselves.|$|R
5000|$|Large {{terrestrial}} mammals include wolf <b>packs,</b> <b>brown</b> bear, black bear, and caribou. Mountain {{goats and}} Dall sheep {{are found in}} mountainous areas. Approximately 13,000 Dall sheep inhabit Wrangell-St. Elias, {{one of the highest}} concentrations of the species in North America. Alaskan moose, though unusual, may sometimes be found in areas with willow growth. [...] The smaller mammals include wolverines, beavers, Canadian lynxes, porcupines, martens, river otters, red foxes, coyotes, ground and flying squirrels, hoary marmots, weasels, snowshoe hares, several species of voles and mice, and collared pikas. A few American bison have been established in two herds in the park. Cougars are considered possible but have not been documented. The waters along the coast host whales, porpoises, harbor seals and sea lions. The endangered Steller sea lion may be found in park waters.|$|R

5000|$|A {{well-known}} wrestler named Abe Coleman saw Brown wrestle {{and recommended}} {{him to the}} promoter in St. Louis, Tom <b>Packs.</b> <b>Brown</b> impressed many people with his wrestling skills in matches against former world heavyweight champions Jim Londos and Ed [...] "Strangler" [...] Lewis. He quickly won the Kansas Heavyweight Championship. Brown {{went on to become}} the Kansas-based Midwest Wrestling Association (MWA) World Heavyweight Champion for a record of 11 times from 1940 to 1948. Brown won the title by beating wrestlers such as Bobby Bruns, Lee Wyckoff, Tom Zaharias, Swedish Angel, Roy Graham and Tug Carlson. In 1948, promoter Pinkie George, along with other promoters, recognized Brown as the World Heavyweight Champion in the newly formed National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). Brown began the NWA's project of unifying the various world heavyweight championships contested at that time with the NWA version. A significant unification match took place against Frank Sexton on March 15, 1949. Sexton held the American Wrestling Alliance Heavyweight Championship, the second most important championship in the country at that time, which he had previously unified with the Maryland version of the World Heavyweight Championship. Brown held the World Heavyweight Championship until he was forced to retire in November 1949 due to injuries he suffered on November 1, 1949 in a car accident. He was scheduled to participate in a unification match against Lou Thesz on November 25, 1949. Thesz was awarded the title as Brown was unable to compete. After retiring, Brown became a promoter in Kansas City, Missouri. He promoted the Midwest Wrestling Association (MWA) from the founding of the NWA in 1948 until 1958, when the promotion was taken over by Bob Geigel.|$|R

50|$|The maximum {{reported}} {{length for}} this ray is 64 cm. It has a rounded pectoral fin disc and two dorsal fins, with {{the base of}} the first placed entirely above the pelvic fins. The tail has a ridge-like lateral fold and a small caudal fin. The spiracles are fringed with small papillae. The clasper glans region does not have an integumental flap, as in Torpedo panthera and Torpedo adenensis. The coloration is generally yellowish or reddish-brown above, with numerous closely <b>packed</b> dark <b>brown</b> spots. However, there is enormous variation in the number, size, and disposition of the darker spots, and some specimens have a dark grayish- or blackish-brown dorsal coloration with no spots at all. Other specimens have gray flecks along with the darker spots, or an altogether gray coloration. The population from Mauritius may be distinct, as they have smaller, more regularly displayed spots on a lighter background color.|$|R

The highest viscosity of gelatinized starch was observed for the starch of Ilpum rice variety relative to other varieties.
