50|$|Manganese {{phosphate}} {{can also}} be used for coatings (which are processed as described above). These coatings are useful for protection against corrosion and wear over time, due to their toughness. Manganese <b>phosphate</b> <b>coating</b> can often be found in the oil and gas industry, firearms and ordnance, aerospace, gears and bearings, and in marine equipment. They are also common in engines, screws, nuts and bolts, and washers.|$|E

50|$|Osseointegration is {{a dynamic}} process in which {{characteristics}} of the implant (i.e. macrogeometry, surface properties, etc.) {{play a role in}} modulating molecular and cellular behavior. While osseointegration has been observed using different materials, it is most often used to describe the reaction of bone tissues to titanium, or titanium <b>coated</b> with calcium <b>phosphate</b> derivatives. It was previously thought that titanium implants were retained in bone through the action of mechanical stabilization or interfacial bonding. Alternatively, calcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>coated</b> implants were thought to be stabilized via chemical bonding. It is now known that both calcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>coated</b> implants and titanium implants are stabilized chemically with bone, either through direct contact between calcium and titanium atoms, or by the bonding to a cement line-like layer at the implant/bone interface. While there are some differences (e.g. like the lack of chondrogenic progenitors), osseointegration occurs through the same mechanisms as bone fracture healing.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Bone {{resorption}} is {{a physiological}} process after tooth extraction. The use of bone substitutes {{to fill the}} tooth socket is suggested to prevent bone resorption and establish good bone architecture for implant placement. A pure ß-tricalcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>coated</b> with copolymer (polylactic-polyglycolic acid) as a root analogue, is suitable for filling tooth sockets. Case report. We presented a patient successfully treated with root analogue after extraction of the right second lower premolar. Three months later, the patient was planned for the placement of six TE® ITI dental implants into the mandible. During the surgery, the biopsy of bone-like tissue from the previously treated socket was taken. All the implants were immediately loaded due to good primary stability. Histological analysis of the specimen revealed fibrous healing in the area treated with root analogue. Conclusion. The use of ß-tricalcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>coated</b> with copolymers after tooth extraction enables satisfactory bone architecture for consequent implant treatment...|$|R
50|$|Most {{phosphate}} coatings {{serve as}} a surface preparation for further coating and/or painting, a function it performs effectively with excellent adhesion and electric isolation. The porosity allows the additional materials to seep into the <b>phosphate</b> <b>coating</b> and become mechanically interlocked after drying. The dielectric nature will electrically isolate anodic and cathodic areas {{on the surface of}} the part, minimizing underfilm corrosion that sometimes occurs at the interface of the paint/coating and the substrate.|$|E
50|$|The 3500000 sq ft plant {{opened in}} 1952 on 229 acre, and {{integrates}} both stamping and assembly operations. Assembled body units and stamped body components are {{transferred from the}} stamping/body area of one building to the paint and assembly area of the adjacent building via an overpass bridge. The assembly process includes welding (with and without robots) and sealing of sheet metal body components, metal finishing (sanding and surface preparation), <b>phosphate</b> <b>coating,</b> painting, and final assembly.|$|E
50|$|The {{resulting}} coating has a matte appearance, and is {{hard and}} brittle - under further working such as pressing or bending powder is produced from {{degradation of the}} coating, together with cracks on the surface. In comparison to a zinc (galvanized) coating galvannealed has better spot weldability, and is paintable, Due to iron present in the surface alloy phase galvanneal develops a reddish patina in moist environments - it is generally used painted. Zinc <b>phosphate</b> <b>coating</b> is a common pre-painting surface treatment.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} total joint {{arthroplasty}} {{is to reduce}} pain and restore function. Its success depends on {{the formation of a}} new bone that stabilizes the prosthesis. The proposed solution for this important problem is to have bio-coated implant surfaces which are more conductive to bone growth. Additionally, collagen has long been used as a matrix for medical applications, because of its biocompatibility and adaptability. In this study, a test method for measuring the tensile adhesion strength of collagen to titanium alloy and calcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>coated</b> surfaces with different roughness values was developed, in order to evaluate how well the collagen adheres to the metallic and bio-coated surfaces. A precision motion system was used to stretch gels that were adherent to the plate surfaces. The tests were done in DMEM solution.

50|$|Zinc {{phosphate}} (Zn3(PO4)2) is an {{inorganic chemical}} compound {{used as a}} corrosion resistant coating on metal surfaces either {{as part of an}} electroplating process or applied as a primer pigment (see also red lead). It has largely displaced toxic materials based on lead or chromium, and by 2006 it had become the most commonly used corrosion inhibitor. Zinc <b>phosphate</b> <b>coats</b> better on a crystalline structure than bare metal, so a seeding agent is often used as a pre-treatment. One common agent is sodium pyrophosphate.|$|R

50|$|The {{performance}} of the <b>phosphate</b> <b>coating</b> is significantly dependent on the crystal structure {{as well as the}} weight. For example, a microcrystalline structure is usually optimal for corrosion resistance or subsequent painting. A coarse grain structure impregnated with oil, however, may be the most desirable for wear resistance. These factors are controlled by selecting the appropriate phosphate solution, using various additives, and controlling bath temperature, concentration, and phosphating time. A widely used additive is to seed the metal surface with tiny particles of titanium salts by adding these to the rinse bath preceding the phosphating. This is known as activation.|$|E

50|$|The {{immersion}} method {{is used for}} the processing of manganese phosphate coatings. The steps of immersion include degreasing/cleaning, water rinses, pickling in mineral acid, activation, manganese phosphating, an optional final drying, and lubrication using oils or emulsion. The first step of this method is to degrease and clean, typically with strong alkaline cleaners. Pickling in mineral acid is a useful process described by the removal of oxide, resulting in a clean surface. The water pre-rinse activation allows the cleaning and pickling to take place while avoiding the formation of coarse-crystalline phosphate. Manganese phosphating is performed, typically in a bath of dilute phosphoric acid that is at approximately 95˚C for about 5-20 minutes (the time varies with the state of the surface being coated). The elements that were coated are then allowed to dry, possibly in an oven. The final step of manganese <b>phosphate</b> <b>coating</b> is to lubricate the materials with oil by immersing them in the oil bath and then letting them drain. This results in different thicknesses of oil when different concentrations and types of oil are used.|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{a double}} coating {{protection}} technique of phosphating treatment and copper plating {{was made to}} improve the corrosion resistance of sintered Nd-Fe-B magnets. In other words, the intergranular region of sintered Nd-Fe-B is allowed to generate passive <b>phosphate</b> conversion <b>coating</b> through <b>phosphating</b> treatment, followed by the copper coating {{on the surface of}} sintered Nd-Fe-B. The morphology and corrosion resistance of the phosphated sintered Nd-Fe-B were observed using SEM and electrochemical method respectively. The <b>phosphate</b> conversion <b>coating</b> was formed more preferably on the intergranular region of sintered Nd-Fe-B than on the main crystal region; just after a short time of phosphating treatment, the intergranular region of sintered Nd-Fe-B has been covered by the <b>phosphate</b> conversion <b>coating</b> and the corrosion resistance is significantly improved. With the synergistic protection of the intergranular phosphorization and the followed copper electrodeposition, the corrosion resistance of the sintered Nd-Fe-B is significantly better than that with a single phosphate film or single plating protection.
