40|$|Bangladesh Open University (BOU) runs school {{programs}} {{as part of}} its academic activities through open schooling since its inception. As of today, the Open School uses the first generation self-learning materials (SLMs) written, before an era, following an in-house style and template. The concerned faculty member corrects, every year, texts before the reprint; but this is limited to spelling mistakes, factual errors and <b>page</b> <b>make-ups</b> only. The University has taken policy and steps to revise the texts as a whole which is still limited to the previous process. But; the current government is implementing the agenda of digital Bangladesh which definitely will influence the texts vis-à-vis template, learner’s instructions, gender-sensitiveness, context and content. In addition, education theory has been sifted from instructivism to constructivism which is being experimented and implemented by the Ministerial project entitled Teaching Quality Improvement (TQI) partnering with the BOU School of Education with new texts. Time changes, new things are being adopted. Open School also requires revising its texts in relation to the government’s current agenda of implementing the digital Bangladesh. This study collects data from tutors, distance educators, writers and reviewers and finally develops a framework for revising the OS SLMs at a digital environment...|$|R

50|$|A reader from Bellary {{originally}} {{suggested the}} name Andhra Prabha, {{and the management}} of the newspaper awarded him with the sum of 116 rupees as a token of their gratitude. The paper was initially edited by Khasa Subba Rao (joint editor of Indian Express) who was succeeded by Nyayapati Narayana Murthy. In 1942, Narla Venkateswara Rao was promoted from news-editor to editor of the paper. He held this position for seventeen years, a period of time that is considered epochal in Telugu journalism. He was responsible for many revolutionary changes in headline and caption writing, in the framing of action photos, in news display and in <b>page</b> <b>make-up.</b> It was during Narlas editorship that the paper was closed down for a brief period during the Quit India Movement. The newspaper was shut down for a few months in order to protest the British Governments attempt to impose censorship on the press. The Andhra Prabha was also banned from the State of Mysore and the State of Hyderabad because it opposed the feudal nature of these regimes. Narla later tendered his resignation when he had a falling out with Ramnath Goenka over his sympathy with the workers in the press which resulted in a strike in Chennai. He was succeeded by Neelamraju Venkataseshaiah. Venkataseshaiah was succeeded by Panditharadhyula Nageswara Rao, from 1969-1976.|$|E

Furthermore, the TEXscript showed various TEXfalls. I like to define these as: correct TEXing no...|$|E
