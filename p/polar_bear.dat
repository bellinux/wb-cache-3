5|$|The teams mascots are a {{male and}} female <b>polar</b> <b>bear.</b> The male <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> wears the Halla home jersey and the female <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> wears the away jersey. She also wears a white skirt and has red eyes. No name has been {{released}} for either of the polar bears. In February 2012 the team began an event to choose {{a name for the}} male mascot with the name to be announced {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|An apex {{predator}} affects {{prey population}} dynamics and defense tactics (such as camouflage). The <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> is the apex predator within its range. Several animal species, particularly Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), routinely scavenge <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> kills. The relationship between ringed seals and polar bears {{is so close}} that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals. The evolutionary pressure of <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the Antarctic, {{where there is no}} major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice. The fur of Arctic pups is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic pups all have dark fur.|$|E
5|$|As Binky {{approached}} sexual maturity, zoo officials negotiated for {{the purchase}} of a female <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> named Mimi from the Tulsa Zoo in Oklahoma. As the transfer was being finalized, however, Mimi died from a viral disease in Tulsa. In February 1979, young <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> twins (Nuka, a female, and Siku, a male) joined Binky in his enclosure. Binky got along poorly with Siku, however, so Siku was given to a zoo in Morelia, Mexico in 1981.|$|E
40|$|The {{adaptation}} {{of black and}} <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> to their environments {{is proportional to the}} severity of climate and food restriction. Both black and <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> mate during the spring, despite differences in their recent metabolic state. Reproductive activity in black bears follows 4 mo of torpor, whereas reproduction in <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> occurs prior to torpor. The goals of this study were to measure the annual changes in serum sex steroids in male and female black and <b>polar</b> <b>bears,</b> and to determine if changes in serum levels of these steroids were asso-ciated with metabolic condition or photoperiod. Serum testosterone (T) concentrations were elevated during spring in black and <b>polar</b> <b>bears.</b> Moreover, this increase in serum T in <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> during spring was correlated with age and testis size. Serum progesterone (P 4) concentrations increased in pregnant <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> in fall coinci-dent with the time of expected implantation. No increases in serum P 4 were observed in nonpregnant black and <b>polar</b> <b>bears.</b> Serum estradiol (E 2) was elevated in nonpregnant and pregnant <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> 2 mo prior to the time of expected implantation. We found that serum sex steroids measured in black and <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> change indepen-dent of torpor. Therefore, our results suggest that photoperiod may be a more important regulator of serum steroid levels and reproduction than metabolic condition...|$|R

5|$|In late 2005 the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) {{threatened}} action {{over the}} holding in captivity of Mercedes, then Britain's only <b>polar</b> <b>bear.</b> The zoo had initially planned to retire their <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> exhibit after Mercedes died. When zoo officials {{announced plans to}} create a new attraction, citing their responsibility to ensure the survival of the species, the ALF threatened damage to zoo workers' property and other scare-tactics. Edinburgh's treatment of polar bears had often been subject to criticism, punctuated by incidents like the death in 1997 of Mercedes' partner Barney, who choked on a plastic child's toy thrown into his enclosure. In 2009 the zoo carried out their plans {{to create a new}} exhibit and improve conditions for Mercedes, moving her to the Highland Wildlife Park, where she was joined by a young male <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> named Walker. Mercedes was euthanized on compassionate grounds in 2011, suffering from severe arthritis.|$|E
5|$|Polar {{bears are}} thought to have diverged from a {{population}} of brown bears, Ursus arctos, that became isolated during a period of glaciation in the Pleistocene or from the eastern part of Siberia, (from Kamchatka and the Kolym Peninsula). The oldest known <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> fossil is a 130,000 to 110,000-year-old jaw bone, found on Prince Charles Foreland in 2004. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> diverged from the brown bear roughly 150,000 years ago. Further, some clades of brown bear, as assessed by their mtDNA, are more closely related to polar bears than to other brown bears, meaning that the <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> might not be considered a species under some species concepts.|$|E

50|$|From 1970 to 2007, Stirling {{served as}} a {{research}} scientist for the Canadian Wildlife Service, focusing his research on <b>polar</b> <b>bears,</b> most notably on a long-term study of <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> in western Hudson Bay near Churchill, Manitoba.

50|$|<b>Polar</b> <b>bears</b> rarely live beyond 25 years. The oldest wild bears {{on record}} {{died at age}} 32, whereas the oldest captive was a female who died in 1991, age 43. The causes of death in wild adult <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> are poorly understood, as {{carcasses}} are rarely found in the species's frigid habitat. In the wild, old <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> eventually become too weak to catch food, and gradually starve to death. <b>Polar</b> <b>bears</b> injured in fights or accidents may either die from their injuries or become unable to hunt effectively, leading to starvation.|$|R
5|$|The most {{widespread}} {{species is}} the brown bear, which occurs from Western Europe eastwards through Asia {{to the western}} areas of North America. The American black bear is restricted to North America, and the <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> is restricted to the Arctic Sea. All the remaining species of bear are Asian. They occur {{in a range of}} habitats which include tropical lowland rainforest, both coniferous and broadleaf forests, prairies, steppes, montane grassland, alpine scree slopes, Arctic tundra {{and in the case of}} the <b>polar</b> <b>bear,</b> ice floes. Bears may dig their dens in hillsides or use caves, hollow logs and dense vegetation for shelter.|$|E
5|$|The walrus and <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> hunts were {{filmed in}} July 1932 at Herald Island in the Chukchi Sea. Walrus {{carcasses}} {{were used as}} dog food and to attract polar bears. Additional <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> hunting was filmed in March 1933 off Cape Lisburne. The bowhead whale hunt was filmed from late April to July 1933 in two locations: Off Point Hope, Alaska, and off Cape Serdtse-Kamen on the Chukchi Peninsula. The whale hunting shoot took nearly three months because the whales kept fleeing every time they spotted boats. As depicted in the film, the Inupiat also hunted polar bears by roping and drowning them, but little of this footage {{made it into the}} picture.|$|E
5|$|These small {{whales are}} also {{targeted}} by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> is well adapted for hunting Arctic whales and calves. Bears {{are known to}} use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Whales lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. This however means less room around the breathing hole as the ice slowly closes the gap. When out at sea, whales dive {{out of the reach}} of surface-hunting orcas. <b>Polar</b> <b>bear</b> attacks on belugas and narwhals are usually successful in winter, but rarely inflict any damage in summer.|$|E
2500|$|The hybrids {{demonstrated}} behavior {{more similar}} to <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> than grizzlies. They stomped toys similar to how <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> break ice, and hurled bags to the side [...] "as <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> may hurl prey". Grizzlies given the same bags do not demonstrate this hurling behavior. The hybrids were also observed lying down similar to polar bears: on their bellies with rear legs splayed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Behavioral {{predictions}} {{based on}} optimal for-aging models that assume an energy-maximizing strategy have been challenged on both {{theoretical and empirical}} grounds. Although <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> (Ursus maritimus) are spe-cialist predators of seal pups on the Arctic ice pack, the use of terrestrial food sources during the ice-free period has received increased attention {{in recent years in}} light of climate predictions. Across a 10 -day period of observation, we documented between four and six individual <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> successfully capture at least nine flightless lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) and engage in at least eight high-speed pursuits of geese. The observed predatory behaviors of <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> do not support predic-tions made by energy-optimizing foraging models and suggest that <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> may frequently engage in energy inefficient pursuits of terrestrial prey. Further study of the nutritional needs and foraging behaviors of <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> during the ice-free period is warranted, given that <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> are predicted to spend more time on land as climate change advances...|$|R

5|$|The Tolkiens {{had four}} {{children}}: John Francis Reuel Tolkien (17 November 1917 – 22 January 2003), Michael Hilary Reuel Tolkien (22 October 1920 – 27 February 1984), Christopher John Reuel Tolkien (born 21 November 1924) and Priscilla Mary Anne Reuel Tolkien (born 18 June 1929). Tolkien was very {{devoted to his}} children and sent them illustrated letters from Father Christmas when they were young. Each year more characters were added, such as the North <b>Polar</b> <b>Bear</b> (Father Christmas's helper), the Snow Man (his gardener), Ilbereth the elf (his secretary), and various other, minor characters. The major characters would relate tales of Father Christmas's battles against goblins who rode on bats and the various pranks committed by the North <b>Polar</b> <b>Bear.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of extant bear {{species is}} shown in a cladogram based on complete mitochondrial DNA sequences from Yu et al., 2007. The giant panda, followed by the spectacled bear are clearly the oldest species. The relationships of the other species are not very well resolved, though the <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> and the brown bear form a close grouping.|$|E

25|$|<b>Polar</b> <b>bears</b> {{appear on}} Jan Mayen, {{although}} in diminished numbers compared with earlier times. Between 1900 and 1920, {{there were a}} number of Norwegian trappers spending winters on Jan Mayen, hunting Arctic foxes in addition to some <b>polar</b> <b>bears.</b> But the exploitation soon made the profits decline, and the hunting ended. <b>Polar</b> <b>bears</b> are genetically distinguishable in this region of the Arctic from those living elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|<b>Polar</b> <b>bears</b> are {{animals that}} are {{specifically}} affected {{through the process of}} rising sea levels. Living near the Arctic region, <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> find their food on ice caps and sheets of ice. As these sheets continue to become fewer in quantity, it is predicted that the <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> will have a difficult time sustaining life and that by the year 2050, there could be less than 20,000 on Earth.|$|R
5|$|The {{scenes of}} walrus, bowhead whale, and caribou hunting are all real. Because the hunting season for caribou, <b>polar</b> <b>bear,</b> walrus, and whale {{occur at the}} same time, the {{production}} was forced {{to spend more than}} a year in the Arctic (covering two hunting seasons) {{in order to get the}} necessary footage.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} {{survivors}} of the crash of a commercial passenger jet flying between Sydney and Los Angeles, on a mysterious tropical island somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean.

5|$|While {{designing}} the Creighton-Ward Mansion sets, Bell {{and his staff}} strove for authenticity, ordering miniature Tudor paintings, -scale Georgian- and Regency-style furniture and carpeting {{in the shape of}} a <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> skin. This realism was enhanced by adding scrap items acquired from household waste and electronics shops. For example, a vacuum cleaner pipe serves as Virgil Tracy's launch chute.|$|E
50|$|A {{significant}} number of <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> are found at Hopen in the winter; moreover, the sub-population of Ursus maritimus found here is a genetically distinct taxon of <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> associated with the Barents Sea region.|$|R
25|$|Kodiak {{bears are}} the largest brown bear, {{comparable}} in size to <b>polar</b> <b>bears.</b> This makes Kodiak <b>bears</b> and <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> both the two largest members of the bear family and Kodiak bears the largest extant terrestrial carnivorans.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the many birds, wintering <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> hunt and feed on ice seals in the shore-fast ice, along open leads, or at openings in pack ice. Pregnant <b>polar</b> <b>bears</b> frequently build winter dens {{in and around the}} area.|$|R
5|$|Among animals, {{variable}} snow camouflage {{is a type}} {{of seasonal}} polyphenism with a distinct winter plumage or pelage. It is found in birds such as the rock ptarmigan, lagomorphs such as the Arctic hare, mustelids such as the stoat, and one canid, the Arctic fox. Since these have evolved separately, the similar appearance is due to convergent evolution. Some high Arctic species like the snowy owl and <b>polar</b> <b>bear</b> however remain white all year round.|$|E
5|$|The series {{takes place}} over the span of six books, which are: The Quest Begins, Great Bear Lake, Smoke Mountain, The Last Wilderness, Fire in the Sky, and Spirits in the Stars.
