Australia almost struck back two minutes later but brutal one-on-one New Zealand defence prevented the try. Finally Australia scored in the corner. The ball looked to be grassed early and then bobble over the line without Australian player Emma Tonegato being in control. But the five points went onto the scoreboard. They went on and scored again right on halftime through Evania <b>Pelite.</b> Australia made an awful start to the second half, kicking the ball out on the full.

40|$|International audienceSynkinematic phyllosilicates in fault zones {{can be used}} {{to deduce}} the {{deformation}} mechanisms and the conditions of fault activity, as their chemical composition, crystal structure and texture can record the different stages of deformation and fluid-rock interactions. The Pic de Port Vieux, a second-order thrust related to the major Gavarnie thrust in the southern central part of the Pyrenees Axial Zone, juxtaposes Triassic <b>pelites</b> of the hanging wall and Cretaceous limestones of the footwall. In order to investigate the mineralogical and geochemical changes and constrain the deformation conditions of thrusting, characterization of phyllosilicates was performed along a transect in the fault hanging wall <b>pelites.</b> The Triassic <b>pelites</b> are mainly composed of quartz, calcite, phyllosilicates (chlorite and K-white mica) and ± hematite. The core fault zone thickness is estimated to be about one meter of intensively foliated green <b>pelites,</b> whereas the damage zone is composed of several meters of red <b>pelites.</b> XRD data demonstrated that the difference in color is related to hematite which is only present in the damage zone. Phyllosilicates of the damage zone are mainly inherited/diagenetic K-white mica and chlorite. In the core zone, newly formed chlorite is abundant and preferentially located in veins. It is enriched in Fe compared to the chlorite of the red <b>pelites.</b> The well-defined foliation in the core zone is overlaid by preferentially oriented muscovite grains which have homogeneous compositions, with less Na and relatively more Fe than mica from the red <b>pelites.</b> Newly formed chlorite and muscovite in the core zone are synkinematic to the fault activity. They are both related to deformation processes and fluid rock interactions. Kübler index measurements and chlorite thermometry show that synkinematic phyllosilicates have registered a temperature of 270 °C ± 23 °C for the damage zone and 285 °C ± 28 °C for the core zone which are corresponding to lower-anchizone/epizone grade conditions. Numerical modelling with the geochemical modelling program PhreeqC was performed to determine the favorable conditions for the mineralogical change between red and green <b>pelites.</b> It suggests that the main critical parameter favoring hematite dissolution and chlorite precipitation in the core zone, is the redox conditions. According to the model, the chemical changes in the core zone occurred due to interactions with highly reductive fluids. In addition, the hematite dissolution maybe the source of iron for newly formed phyllosilicates in the core zone that are more iron rich compared to those from the red <b>pelites...</b>|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the behavior of}} Segou sandstones in the laboratory and in the field conditions. Four types of sandstone are collected {{in the northern part}} of the Madina Kouta basin (eastern Senegal). These types of specimens are the white sandstones, the red sandstones, the purple sandstones and the sandstones with intercalation of <b>pelites.</b> Uniaxial tests are carried out on these specimens of sandstones. The Young Moduli (E) and the Uniaxial Compression Strengths (Rc) are higher for the white sandstone. Values of the mechanical parameters decrease slightly for red sandstones due to an increase of the amount of <b>pelites</b> in the composition of the rock. Decrease of mechanical parameters is more important for the purple facies due to an important network of fractures. The facies with weaker characteristics corresponds to the sandstones with intercalation of <b>pelites.</b> This is due to the soft nature of the <b>pelites.</b> The slope stability of the Cliff sides depends also on to these characteristics...|$|R

50|$|A <b>pelite</b> (Ancient Greek pelos, clay) is a metamorphosed {{fine-grained}} sedimentary rock, i.e. mudstone or siltstone. The {{term was}} earlier used by geologists {{to describe a}} clay-rich, fine-grained clastic sediment or sedimentary rock, i.e. mud or a mudstone, the metamorphosed version of which would technically have been a metapelite. It was equivalent to the now little-used Latin-derived term lutite. A semipelite is defined in part as having similar chemical composition but being of a crystalloblastic nature.|$|E
50|$|The {{footwall}} to the mineralization is a psammopelite gneiss, {{consisting of}} feldspar, quartz, garnet, biotite and amphibole, with a <b>pelite</b> gneiss on the hanging wall. The footwall gneiss contains anomalous mineral chemistries including a rare lead-rich feldspar and manganese-rich garnet chemistries.

5000|$|Argillite (...) is a {{fine-grained}} {{sedimentary rock}} composed predominantly of indurated clay particles. Argillaceous rocks are basically lithified muds and oozes. They contain variable amounts of silt-sized particles. The argillites grade into shale when the fissile layering typical of shale is developed. Another name for poorly lithified argillites is mudstone. These rocks, although variable in composition, are typically high in aluminium and silica with variable alkali and alkaline earth cations. The term pelitic or <b>pelite</b> is often applied to these sediments and rocks. Metamorphism of argillites produces slate, phyllite, and pelitic schist.|$|E
40|$|P-T {{conditions}} and prograde P-T paths have been calculated for amphibolite-grade <b>pelites</b> and amphibolites from Cordillera Darwin, Tierra del Fuego, Chile. Peak P-T conditions are nearly all within the kyanite stability field; temperatures generally show an increase with increasing grade, but pressures have a less consistent trend, possibly increasing slightly from garnet to kyanite grade. P—T paths from <b>pelites</b> show heating by 80 - 100 °C during loading of 0 - 2 - 3 kbar. Textural analysis and previous structural work {{indicate that this}} segment of the path correlates with back-folding deformation. P-T paths from two Mg-rich garnet amphibolites suggest a decrease in pressure {{of as much as}} 3 kbar with 25 - 50 °C of heating from the kyanite stability field to the sillimanite, and are consistent with pervasive, minor development of fibrolitic sillimanite along plagioclase grain boundaries. Together, the P-T path segments from <b>pelites</b> and amphibolites constitute a clockwise P-T trajectory. The proposed clockwise P-T paths are consistent with the interpretation that Cordillera Darwin represents an extensionally exhumed metamorphic core complex, in which loading during garnet growth in the pelitic rocks was succeeded by differential uplift during garnet growth in magnesian amphibolites...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{profiles}} in Devonian marine deposits have been studied, consisting of <b>pelites,</b> subgreywackes, greywackes and quartzites. Quartz and clay minerals are major components and feldspar and calcite are minor ones. Phyllosilicates {{in the fine}} fractions are kaolinite and illite; kaolinite has {{a high degree of}} ordering; illite is predominantly of a 1 Md polytype, with low Na content and poor crystallinity and has a phengitic composition i greywackes, whereas in <b>pelites</b> it is muscovitic in composition. Both phyllosilicates may be inherited from a source area with intensive weathering processes, although illite may also be a diagenetic phase. These mineral characteristics indicate that the Devonian rocks did not reach the anchizone boundary in their post-depositional evolution. The chemical composition of <b>pelites</b> and subgreywackes reveals a high degree of chemical maturity. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns indicate a higher degree of weathering of these Devonian sediments han of Post-Archaean Australian Shales (PAAS), possibly as a consequence of sedimentary ecycling processes. The REE patterns of the Devonian rocks in addition to the high Th/Sc, La/Sc and Th/Co ratios suggest a felsic composition of the primitive source area, probably a K-rich granite...|$|R

50|$|Metamorphic rock naming can {{be based}} on texture, protolith, {{metamorphic}} facies, and/or the locations {{in which they are}} found. Naming based on texture and a <b>pelite</b> (e.g., shale, mudrock) protolith can be used to define slate and phyllite. Texture-based names are schist and gneiss. These textures, from slate to gneiss, define a continually-increasing extent of metamorphism. Metamorphic facies are defined by the pressure-temperature fields in which particular minerals form. Additional metamorphic rock names exist: greenstone (metamorphosed basalt and other extrusive igneous rock) is a classification based on composition and being located Precambrian terranes, while quartzite is based only on composition, as quartz is too stable and homogeneous to change phase at typical metamorphic temperatures and pressures.|$|E
5000|$|Lutite is old terminology, {{which is}} not widely used, by Earth {{scientists}} in field descriptions for fine-grained, sedimentary rocks, which are composed of silt-size sediment, clay-size sediment, or a mixture of both. When mixed with water lutites often disintegrate into mud. Because this is a field term, {{there is a lack}} of any precise definition for it based upon specific grain-size characteristics. Lutites include a variety of fine-grained sedimentary rocks, including calcisiltite, calcilutite, claystone, mudstone, shale, and siltstone. It is equivalent to the term mudstone and the Greek-derived term <b>pelite.</b> Lutite was first used in 1904 by Grabau, who derived it from the Latin word for mud. He also proposed a number of prefixes to be used with and attached to [...] "lutite" [...] in order to designated various types of lutites. None of these prefixes are used by Earth scientists nowadays.|$|E

50|$|Ben Vane (Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Mheadhain) is a Scottish {{mountain}} {{situated in}} the southern Highlands. The underlying geology almost entirely comprises the Beinn Bheula Schist Formation - Psammite and <b>Pelite</b> with a Siluro-Devonian Dyke prominent round the northern and eastern face. It {{is one of the}} Arrochar Alps and stands slightly separate from the other mountains of the group being connected on its western side to the neighbouring Beinn Ìme by a low col at 492 metres. Ben Vane itself just qualifies as a Munro reaching a height of 915 metres (3002 feet) and is characterised by steep and rugged slopes which fall away to the Inveruglas Water to the east and the Allt Coiregroigan to the south; to the north the descent is more undulating going over the subsidiary top of Beinn Dubh before falling to the valley {{at the north end of}} Loch Sloy. Dense forestry cloak the mountain on its lower southern slope in Allt Coiregroigan. Also on these southern slopes by the Allt Coiregroigan is a disused quarry which provided crushed stone used for the construction of the Loch Sloy dam in the late 1940s.
