During the computer administration the students' only interaction with an adult occurred when the students were walked from their classroom to the school library where each was led to a table with the Apple II computer. Each student was informed that the computer would administer the directions. In addition the students were informed that if they would like the directions or word repeated, they should press the space bar on the computer keyboard. The PPVT-R software program verbally administered the test instructions and administered the visual sample test items. After each student met the standard for administering the PPVT-R, the software program followed the PPVT-R standard test instructions, verbally administered the stimulus word while displaying the visual choices. The software administration included offering, when appropriate, verbal praise to the child for correct responses and informing each student when the test was completed.|$|E

Use of the PPVT-R to screen for SB:FE performance was discussed. The <b>Peabody</b> <b>Picture</b> <b>Vocabulary</b> <b>Test-Revised</b> (PPVT-R) is a versatile, nonthreatening test of receptive vocabulary comprehension that can be administered quickly and reliably by relatively unspecialized examiners (Dunn & Dunn, 1981). Its predecessor, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, was among the most frequently used tests in the United States (Lubin, Larsen, & Matarazzo, 1984), and the PPVT-R is considered a significant improvement (Sattler, 1988). Use of the PPVT-R to screen school children referred as potentially exceptional learners has been the object of continuing study (Bracken, Prasse, & McCallum, 1984; Carvajal, 1988).

Subjects were 99 mentally retarded adults ranging in age from 17 to 57 years old with a mean age of 28. 6 years. Both males (n = 59) and females (n = 40) were assessed. Subjects were classified as borderline (n = 13), mildly (n = 53), moderately (n = 26), and severely (n = 7) mentally retarded. The sample was selected from four different settings. Two of these settings were mental health facilities (n = 49) and two were vocational settings (n = 50). Subjects completed a structured interview consisting of modified versions of the Beck Depression Inventory, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the Social Performance Survey Schedule. Subjects also completed the <b>Peabody</b> <b>Picture</b> <b>Vocabulary</b> <b>Test-Revised</b> and the Psychopathology Instrument for Mentally Retarded Adults. Informants rated 33 of the original 99 subjects on parallel forms of the Social Performance Survey Schedule and Psychopathology Instrument for Mentally Retarded Adults, and an informant depression scale, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The depression and social skills measures correlated significantly with each other for self-report and for informant-report separately, but only two correlations were noted between these two methods of assessment. This finding is consistent with previous studies. Receptive vocabulary did not significantly correlate with the depression measures nor the social skills measures, irrespective of assessment method.

Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Child Data (NLSY-CD), we conduct a comparative analysis of child development among Mexican American, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic white children ages 3 and 4 (N = 3710). We use the <b>Peabody</b> <b>Picture</b> <b>Vocabulary</b> <b>Test-Revised</b> (PPVT-R) as our operationalization of child development. Descriptive results suggest that, unlike the relative similarity in the rates of low birth weight between the white and Mexican American populations, Mexican Americans have much lower developmental outcomes. Multivariate analysis shows that birth weight is not a powerful predictor of child development, nor does it explain pronounced racial and ethnic differences.

The reasoning behind the goal of this study was to determine that if the three tests showed a strong, positive correlation and identified the same children as needing further assessment, then perhaps the test which was easier and shorter to administer (the PPVT-R) could be used with more confidence 2 as a quick, reliable screening tool of overall receptive language ability. In other words, if a child does poorly on the PPVT-R, one could assume that the child would most likely score below average on the other two tests also.
