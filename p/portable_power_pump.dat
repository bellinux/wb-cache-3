50|$|On August 28, Ma Ying-jeou, the President of the Republic of China ordered {{evacuations}} {{of thousands}} of people from vulnerable areas, saying that a slow moving typhoon could result in more damages and casualties than normal. The Defense Ministry of Taiwan mobilized some 35,000 soldiers to be ready to help out {{as many people as possible}} when the typhoon strikes. The soldiers were in possession of <b>portable</b> <b>power</b> generators, water <b>pumps</b> and amphibious assault vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|The Green Goddesses {{were used}} in two forms, {{initially}} a 4x2 (two-wheel drive) version based on the Bedford SHZ chassis powered by a 6-cylinder 110 bhp Beford petrol engine, carrying 400 gallons of water and a 1000 gallons-per-minute (gpm) Sigmund FN4 centrifugal pump. Later versions {{were based on the}} Bedford 4x4 RLHZ chassis, with the same pump and 300 gallon water capacity. Their primary role was as a mobile pump, and they could combine to provide a pipe relay over great distances when connected using 6-inch hose, supplying 1000 gpm from one location to another, often the seat of a major fire. An inflatable dam was often used as the source for the relay, usually fed by using several Light <b>Portable</b> <b>Pumps</b> <b>powered</b> by Coventry Climax FWP engines. Water could be drawn from 'open water' supplies (Rivers, lakes or reservoirs) by a Transportable Water Unit more commonly known as 'Bikini Units'. These were floated on a raft so they could draw directly from a water and also use water under pressure to propel the raft.|$|R

50|$|In Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau {{issued a}} sea {{warnings}} instructing all ships {{passing through the}} Bashi Channel to stay updated about the typhoon. The president of Taiwan ordered evacuations {{of thousands of people}} from vulnerable areas, saying that a slow moving typhoon could result in more damages and casualties than normal. Some 35,000 soldiers were ordered to be ready to help out {{as many people as possible}} when the typhoon strikes. The soldiers were in possession of <b>portable</b> <b>power</b> generators, water <b>pumps</b> and amphibious assault vehicles. The Taiwan Railway Administration halted services on the South-Link Line in fear that heavy rain could trigger landslides and cause rail-accidents. The Directorate-General of Highways closed the Suhua Highway saying that the area through which the highway was built is more prone to landslides during typhoons. After landfall, Nanmadol dumped very heavy rainfall over the nation. Some 528 millimetres (20.8 in) of rain was dumped in Hualien County; 517 millimetres (20.4 in) in Hengchun, Pingtung County; 449 millimetres (17.7 in) in Taitung County; 292 millimetres (11.5 in) in Pinglin, New Taipei; 275 millimetres (10.8 in) in Kaohsiung; and 265 millimetres (10.4 in) in Taiping Mountain, Yilan County. The Council of Agriculture soon issued a red-alert for six riverside areas advising people that are at a high risk of mudslides after heavy torrential rains dumped by the typhoon. Even long after Nanmadol left Taiwan, heavy rain continued to batter the nation. Several parts of the nation saw rains of more than on meter and 1.5 meters with Pingtung County was the hardest hit of all.|$|R

40|$|Polymer {{electrolyte}} membrane based direct methanol {{fuel cells}} (PEM-DMFC) have a complicated system design, and their fuel efficiency {{is limited by}} methanol cross-over through the proton exchange membrane. In addition, the methanol oxidation kinetics as well as oxygen reduction kinetics are quite slow in the acid electrolyte system. In contrast to acid DMFCs, {{it is known that}} electro-oxidation (and oxygen electro-reduction) reactions are improved in basic media. Alkaline DMFCs, unlike their acid counterparts, do not require MEAs, presently the most costly and complex stack component. It is however unknown if alkaline DMFC could be used as PEM alternatives for <b>portable</b> <b>power</b> applications. The technical challenge then, is to develop AFC stacks {{that can be used to}} fabricate compact low-power (20 W) systems that have sufficient resilience to carbonate build-up inherent in alkaline cells. In addition to carbon dioxide from ambient air, the methanol fuel is an additional source of electrolyte carbonation (CO 2 generated in situ). For <b>portable</b> <b>power</b> applications, one way to circumvent this issue is to replenish the spent alkaline electrolyte on a regular maintenance schedule. This paper reports the results of some preliminary work carried out to investigate the viability of alkaline DMFC for <b>portable</b> <b>power</b> application...|$|R
