25|$|During the 2007 World Cup, he {{got drunk}} {{with some of}} his {{teammates}} before an important game, and nearly drowned when the boat carrying them capsized. In a 2014 episode of 8 out of 10 cats, he claimed that he was attempting to sail home in a <b>pedalo.</b> He stated that he awoke on a beach – the worst place he had ever slept. He lost his position as vice-captain and was fined, but remained {{as a member of the}} team.|$|E
25|$|Flintoff {{returned}} to the England team for the last group match against Kenya, taking two wickets. In the Super 8 matches, Flintoff often excelled with the ball but failed to recover his batting form. Against Ireland he took 4–43 and scored 43 runs; against Sri Lanka he took 3–35 but was out for 2 and against Australia he took 1–35 but was out for 4. In the next match against Bangladesh Flintoff took 1–38 in eight overs and scored 23 runs off 21 balls. Ultimately, he failed to influence an ailing English side and had a poor tournament. Michael Vaughan later commented that Flintoff's <b>pedalo</b> antics had adversely affected team morale.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the opening}} match {{of the tournament}} against New Zealand, Flintoff was out first ball in England's innings and, {{although}} his bowling was very economical, conceding only 17 runs in eight overs, he failed to take a wicket. He did, however, take a stunning one-handed catch at slip to dismiss Ross Taylor for a duck. On the evening of England's defeat Flintoff, along with some other players and coaches from the England squad, indulged in some late night drinking in a night club, only two days before their vital match against Canada. In {{the early hours of}} the morning, he reportedly had to be rescued after falling off a <b>pedalo</b> – this quickly became known in the media as the [...] "Fredalo" [...] incident. Flintoff and the others involved were reprimanded and fined, with Flintoff being stripped of the vice-captaincy. In addition, he was suspended for the match against Canada. It was revealed by England coach Duncan Fletcher that Flintoff had had a number of previous warnings about his behaviour. Flintoff has since issued a public apology, and later also clarified that he didn't actually [...] "fall off" [...] a <b>pedalo,</b> but rather failed in an attempt to board one.|$|E
