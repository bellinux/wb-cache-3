This paper evaluates Multiband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MB-OFDM) as the radio interface for new High Data Rate (HDR) Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) for satellite ground testing. A commercially available development kit was used to perform measurements on a satellite mock-up which were validated on an Eurostar- 3000 satellite structure.

50|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>repeaters</b> {{may be used}} {{to achieve}} NLOS links by {{deliberately}} installing a precisely designed reflector at a critical position to provide a path around the obstruction. However they are unacceptable in most urban environments due to the bulky reflector requiring critical positioning at perhaps an inaccessible location or at one not acceptable to the planning authorities or the owner of the building. Passive reflector NLOS links also incur substantial loss due to the received signal being a 'double inverse-square law' function of the transmit signal, one for each hop from the transmit antenna to the receive antenna. However, they have been successfully used in rural mountainous areas to extend the range of LOS microwave links around mountains, thus creating NLOS links. In such cases the installation of the more usual active repeater was usually not possible due to problems in obtaining a suitable power supply.|$|R

40|$|The {{discovery}} of a charged Higgs boson (H±) would be a clear indication for physics beyond the Standard Model. This thesis describes searches for charged Higgs bosons with the ATLAS experiment at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The first data collected during the LHC Run 1 is analysed, searching for a light charged Higgs boson (mH±<mtop), which decays predominantly into a tau-lepton and a neutrino. Different final states {{with one or two}} leptons (electrons or muons), as well as leptonically or hadronically decaying taus, are studied, and exclusion limits are set. The background arising from misidentified non-prompt electrons and muons was estimated from data. This so-called "Matrix Method'' exploits the difference in the lepton identification between real, prompt, and misidentified or non-prompt electrons and muons. The Matrix Method is used in all charged Higgs boson searches in this thesis. In 2024 the LHC will be upgraded into a High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The ATLAS detector is expected to collect around 300 fb- 1 of collision data until 2022, whereas the HL-LHC will deliver about 250 - 300 fb- 1 of data per year.  This will increase the mean number of interactions per bunch crossing, resulting in larger particle fluxes. This puts challenging requirements on the electronics. In order to keep trigger and data rates at manageable levels, new trigger concepts require more intelligence at early stage which possibly results in more cables and connectors, inside the detector which lead to degraded performance of the detector system. This thesis presents new concepts using wireless technology at 60 GHz, in order add more data links inside the detector system without adding much material. Patch antennas have been developed, operating at 60 GHz. Manufacture methods have been investigated, and the fabrication tolerances and bandwidth of these antennas have been studied. Also, concepts of using <b>passive</b> <b>repeaters</b> have been investigated, to make the 60 GHz signal pass boundaries. These repeaters can be used to connect intelligence inside the detector, but also for reading out data from the whole detector radially...|$|R
5000|$|Mount Wire (also {{known as}} Wire Mountain or Big Beacon) is a {{mountain}} {{located on the}} east side of Salt Lake City, Utah with an elevation of 7146 ft. The mountain is named after Lester Wire, an American policeman of Salt Lake City, Utah, who in 1912 developed the first red-green electric traffic light. [...] Mount Wire is a common spot for adventurous hikers and has many access trails, some created by nearby Red Butte Gardens.The east side of the University of Utah offers direct access to trails to the summit. Mount Wire formerly could be identified from other nearby mountains by its two <b>passive</b> microwave <b>repeaters</b> near the summit. These billboard like structures were used to bounce microwave signals over the mountain to the north-eastern parts of Utah. Mount Wire also houses an old airway beacon directly on the summit.An interesting man-made rock outcropping about halfway up the mountain looks like several lawn chairs in a row, and is a common rest stop for hikers. This stop offers views of Salt Lake City, and the Wasatch Mountains.|$|R
40|$|Many {{times there}} is a need to {{establish}} ratio communication between the surface and a beam enclosure. When one solicits communication companies for solutions, the answer is often to purchase expensive communication equipment such as repeaters or radiax type cable which can cost in the tens of thousands of dollars. This TM will describe an inexpensive solution to this problem and the results that can be expected. The cost of a <b>passive</b> <b>repeater</b> is $ 100 [...] $ 200 depending on how elaborate one wants to be. A <b>passive</b> <b>repeater</b> system consists of two antennas connected together with a transmission line. When using VHF or UHF transceivers, one can use 5 / 8 wave mobile antennas, such as the Larson NMO 406 -CK for the 400 [...] 420 MHz range, with the antenna connected to a 19 inch square piece of aluminum to act as a ground plane. This type of antenna has reasonably good gain, seems to be adequate, and is inexpensive. Another antenna choice is to cut a dipole out of bus wire and solder this wire to a female N connector. Using a dipole seems to work OK in the tunnel and avoids the problem of having a wire sticking down for people to poke their eye with. The cable connecting the antennas should be of good quality so that the signal lost in the cable is minimal. The authors chose Belden 9913 coax. This cable has a characteristic impedance of 50 ohms and has 2. 7 dB/ 100 ft. of attenuation at 400 MHz...|$|E
40|$|Wireless data {{transfer}} has revolutionized the consumer mar ket {{for the last}} decade giving products equipped with transmitters and receiver for wireless data t ransfer. Wireless technology has fea- tures attractive for {{data transfer}} in future tracking detec tors. The removal of wires and connectors for data links is certainly beneficial both for the material b udget and the reliability of the system. One other advantage is the freedom of routing signals which t oday is particularly complicated when bringing the data the first 50 cm outside the tracker. Wit h wireless links intelligence can be built into a tracker by introducing communication betwee n tracking layers within a Region Of Interest which would allow the construction of track primit ives in real time. The wireless signal is transmitted by a passive antenna structure which is a radiat ion hard and much less complex object than an optical link. Due to the requirement of high data rate s in detectors a high bandwidth is required. The frequency band around 60 GHz has large potenti al for use in tracking detectors. The high baseband frequency allow for data transfer of the or der of several Gbit/s, and due to the small wave length in the mm range, only small structures are n eeded. One challenge in applying the technology to trackers is to bring the signal around or th rough boundaries that are not trans- parent to the mm-waves, i. e. silicon detector modules or sup port structures. This article presents a test setup of a 60 GHz data link for radial transmission of mm -waves through an ATLAS de- tector model using a <b>passive</b> <b>repeater</b> structure. We demonst rate that by using a <b>passive</b> <b>repeater</b> structure made of two 60 GHz patch array antennas connected b y a micro strip we can make the signal pass boundarie...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} a linear-polarized reflector that reflects incident wave almost parallel to its surface at 60 GHz, when illuminated by an impinging plane wave with normal incidence. This structure is {{designed as a}} simple and low-cost <b>passive</b> <b>repeater</b> with both a quasi-endfire radiation and a flat profile. Working as a transmission relay, it is a quite potential and possible solution to improve the radio-coverage in the T-shaped corridor, which is a typical scenario of non-light-of-sight (NLOS) environment for 60 GHz indoor communications. The proposed repeater consists of an array of parallel grooves with appropriate depths, drilled in a metallic plate. Full-wave simulations and theoretical investigations are carried out to demonstrate the working principle and to optimize the performance. Then, an 80 -groove breadboard {{in the size of}} 200 mm × 200 mm is fabricated and measured to explore the feasibility of the concept. In a practical measurement, when the distance from the repeater to transmitting antenna (Tx) is 2 m, and to the receiving antenna (Rx) is 1. 5 m, the repeater exhibits a main beam at ± 75 ° with gain up to 22. 7 dB. The communication between Tx and Rx in NLOS areas is thus successfully recovere...|$|E
40|$|Saha, Sandvik Tamrock Oy There are applications, {{where both}} maximum {{available}} bandwidth and reliability are needed. In those applications many issues- like effects of harsh environment, power supply, network length, available bandwidth, bus load, bus topology- {{must be taken}} into account to meet the requirements. There are different solutions to build CAN-networks and every solution has it's own benefits and drawbacks. The packet structure of CAN frames causes most of the limitations, when compared i. e. with Ethernet. Especially with high bit rates, up to 1 Mb/s, those limitations force to very careful network design. This paper will present, that in all selections of networking solutions must be done by taking into account the requirements of the application. Bus, star and tree topologies are examined with active and <b>passive</b> HUBs, <b>repeaters</b> and switches and many pitfalls are found and analyzed. In high speed CAN-networks, inter-segment routing has been found to be one of the most reliable implementation in complex systems. Based on the comparisons can be stated, that the most general solution for combining high-speed CAN-segments, which also meets standards, is to use switches with fully isolated CAN-interfaces. Those systems are electrically reliable, easy to assemble and terminate and maintain over system's life cycle...|$|R
40|$|Abstract It is {{a growing}} trend in the modern housing {{construction}} especially in northern parts of Europe and America to use modern windows with selective glasses {{in order to achieve}} the adequate thermal isolation. The idea is to conserve the energy and discourage the excess use of it following the guidelines of European commission, which aims to achieve zero energy buildings by 2020. Even though the use of such windows do address the energy issue at hand, {{but on the other hand}} they cause problems to the radio wave propagation through these windows. The reason for this is the use of metallic coating made of titanium oxide or silver oxide in general on these windows because of their good properties to provide thermal isolation, but are susceptible to deterioration of radio wave propagation through them. Various solutions to this problem have been addressed in this thesis along with their tradeoffs. The previous and current research being carried out to address this issue also have been discussed thoroughly including the research that worked as the motivation to pursue this issue. Amongst others, one solution is the use of <b>passive</b> <b>repeater</b> to achieve the power gain which have been focused on. A prototype repeater antenna developed earlier at CWC and tested through measurements addresses the problem considerably well. Measurements were taken at EMC chamber, University of Oulu, within the frequency range of 700 MHz to 10 GHz, and the results have been compared and analyzed in this thesis. According to our findings, the repeater antenna under the test has shown promising results. In the future work, the proposed repeater can be tested in real life scenarios and its performance can be analyzed within the real life environmental constraints...|$|E
