5000|$|<b>Projectivity</b> is a {{principle}} of tree structures by which discontinuities are identified and defined. A tree structure {{is said to be}} projective if there are no crossing dependency edges and/or projection lines. If there are crossing edges/lines however, then the structure is non-projective and contains one or more <b>projectivity</b> violations. The concept and terminology of <b>projectivity</b> is associated most with the structures of dependency grammar, although the concept is just as applicable to the structures of phrase structure grammars (= constituency grammars). The discussion here considers <b>projectivity</b> first in terms of dependency-based structures and then in terms of constituency-based structures.|$|E

The structure of (mono-) ojectivity is complicated and hence it is difficult to determine whether these injectivities are inherited by finite direct sums and direct summands even in the case where each module is quasi-continuous.
