50|$|The {{most obvious}} sign {{that a person}} is {{suffering}} from pitted keratolysis is its classic appearance. The circular and shallow pits are the calling card of pitted keratolysis. The pits often overlap in places to produce larger areas of erosion. Occasionally these lesions present with a green or brown hue around and within the pits. These superficial erosions are found under the toes and on the soles of the feet, and especially at the <b>pressure</b> <b>bearing</b> points such as the heel. Both sides of the foot are usually equally effected. Pitted keratolysis is often linked to excessive sweating of the palms or soles (palmoplantar hyperhidrosis.) The bacterial digestion of the keratin results in a very foul odor, causing many of its sufferers great anxiety, especially in social situations. Thankfully, irritation is generally minimal, though occasionally burning, itching, and soreness are experienced with pitted keratolysis. The appearance of this condition’s characteristic lesions is much more pronounced when the affected area is wet.|$|E

40|$|Background: Pitted keratolysis is {{a common}} {{dermatological}} condition. However, very few studies {{are available on the}} clinical characteristics and epidemiological features of this disorder from India and abroad. Materials and Methods: Fifty patients from rural area of Kolar at Sri R. L. J. H. and S. N. R. Hospital, presenting with clinically distinctive lesions of pitted keratolysis were included in the study. Cases were interviewed with particular emphasis on triggering factors and findings were recorded. Investigations like Gram&#x 2032;s stain, culture studies, Wood&#x 2032;s ultraviolet light examination, histopathology etc, was done in selected cases to ascertain the clinical diagnosis. Results: Age of the patients varied from 20 to 40 years in 52 &#x 0025; with male preponderance in 82 &#x 0025; of cases. Duration of the disease varied from 15 days to five years, most of the patients were bare-footed farmers (62 &#x 0025; of cases). Hyperhidrosis and pruritus were most frequently observed symptoms in 70 &#x 0025; and 60 &#x 0025; of patients. Most of the patients presented with the characteristic pits which varied from 1 to 50 in number in 56 &#x 0025; of cases, located predominantly on the <b>pressure</b> <b>bearing</b> areas in 92 &#x 0025; of cases and depth of the pits varied from 1 to 2 mm in 60 &#x 0025; of cases.
