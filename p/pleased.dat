5|$|By 2005, Marvel Entertainment began {{planning}} to independently produce its own films and distribute them through Paramount Pictures.

Marvel made relatively little profit from its licensing deals with other studios {{and wanted to}} get more money out of its films while maintaining artistic control of the projects and distribution. Avi Arad, head of Marvel's film division, was <b>pleased</b> with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films at Sony, but was less <b>pleased</b> about others. As a result, they decided to form Marvel Studios, Hollywood's first major independent movie studio since DreamWorks.|$|E
