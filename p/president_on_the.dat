5|$|After Arias' {{death in}} 1988, Endara became a leading {{opponent}} of the Manuel Noriega military dictatorship, heading the opposition coalition in the 1989 presidential election. Though his coalition was judged by international observers as having defeated pro-Noriega candidate Carlos Duque, the results were annulled by the government, and Endara and his running mates were attacked in the streets by the paramilitary Dignity Battalions. The assaults received widespread coverage in international media, helping to build support within the U.S. for military action against Noriega. Seven months later, the United States invaded Panama, and swore in Endara as the new <b>president</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{first night of the}} invasion on a U.S. military base.|$|E

5|$|Born in New Hampshire, Pierce {{served in}} the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate until he {{resigned}} from the latter in 1842. His private law practice {{in his home state}} was a success; he was appointed U.S. Attorney for his state in 1845. Pierce took part in the Mexican–American War as a brigadier general in the Army. Seen by Democrats as a compromise candidate uniting northern and southern interests, he was nominated as the party's candidate for <b>president</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 49th ballot at the 1852 Democratic National Convention. In the 1852 presidential election, Pierce and his running mate William R. King easily defeated the Whig Party ticket of Winfield Scott and William A. Graham.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Bedell {{had decided to}} run for {{political}} office. In 1972, he ran against Wiley Mayne, a Republican incumbent in Iowa's 6th congressional district. Mayne was a staunch supporter of Richard Nixon and secured victory along with the President in a year favorable to the Republicans. Mayne, however, would politically suffer after Watergate (he was one of only a few Republicans to vote against impeaching the <b>President</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> judiciary committee.) The damage had already been done, and Bedell defeated Mayne in a 1974 rematch.|$|E
5|$|During the 1892 presidential campaign, {{there was}} talk of Russell being the Vice Presidential nominee if Senator John M. Palmer were to receive the Democratic Presidential nomination. In early February 1892, Palmer and Patrick A. Collins, a former Democratic Massachusetts Congressman, agreed to make Palmer the Democratic Presidential {{candidate}} and Russell, Collins' personal and political friend, the Vice Presidential candidate. Palmer ended up rejecting the bid, and argued against it at the 1892 Democratic National Convention. Russell received one vote for <b>President</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first ballot.|$|E

5|$|He {{was a close}} {{political}} ally of President John F. Kennedy, a {{fact that}} disturbed some North Carolina Democrats suspicious of Kennedy's Catholicism. According to Kennedy's personal secretary, Evelyn Lincoln, Sanford would have been Kennedy's choice for vice <b>president</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 1964 Democratic ticket if Kennedy had lived. In her 1968 book Kennedy and Johnson she reported that Kennedy, told her that Lyndon B. Johnson would be replaced as Vice President.|$|E
5|$|Ricardo Arias Calderón (May 4, 1933 – February 13, 2017) was a Panamanian {{politician}} {{who served as}} First Vice President from 1989 to 1992. A Roman Catholic who studied at Yale and the Sorbonne, Arias returned to Panama in the 1960s to work for political reform. He {{went on to become}} the president of the Christian Democratic Party of Panama and a leading opponent of the military government of Manuel Noriega. In 1984, he ran as a candidate for Second Vice <b>President</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ticket of three-time former president Arnulfo Arias, but they were defeated by pro-Noriega candidate Nicolás Ardito Barletta.|$|E
5|$|Six {{men were}} {{candidates}} for the Greenback nomination. James B. Weaver, an Iowa congressman and Civil War general, was the clear favorite, but two other congressmen, Benjamin F. Butler from Massachusetts and Hendrick B. Wright from Pennsylvania, also commanded considerable followings. Weaver triumphed quickly, winning {{a majority of the}} 850 delegates' votes on the first ballot. Barzillai J. Chambers, a Texas businessman and Confederate veteran, was likewise nominated for vice <b>president</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> initial vote. More tumultuous was the fight over the platform, as delegates from disparate factions of the left-wing movement clashed over women's suffrage, Chinese immigration, {{and the extent to which}} the government should regulate working conditions.|$|E

Behind him finished Governor Rockefeller, second with 277 delegates, followed by Governor Ronald Reagan, in third place, having just entered the race, accruing 182 delegates.

5|$|The Council {{is made up}} of its Chairman (as of 6 November 2012 the Chief Justice of Singapore, Sundaresh Menon), up to ten {{permanent}} members who are appointed for life, and up to ten ordinary members who are appointed for a period of three years and may be re-appointed. Appointments are made by the <b>President</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> advice of the Cabinet. If the President does not concur with Cabinet's advice, he may veto appointments. However, he is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers ("CPA"), and if the CPA does not concur with his view, Parliament may override his decision with a resolution passed with a two-thirds majority vote. The President has no power to remove current PCMR members.|$|E
5|$|The NMP {{scheme was}} {{introduced}} in 1990 and serves to introduce into Parliament alternative, independent and non-partisan views from minorities and experts. This is said to effectively raises the level of political discourse. Women, for example, who are usually under-represented in parliament, may be appointed as an NMP to provide alternate views. A special select committee of Parliament nominates candidates to be appointed as NMPs by the <b>President</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> advice of the Cabinet. In 2010, the number of NMPs was increased from six to nine. NMPs share the same powers and privileges as NCMPs.|$|E

5|$|The Republic of Ireland is a {{parliamentary}} democracy {{based on the}} British model, with a written constitution and a popularly elected president who has mostly ceremonial powers. The government is headed by a prime minister, the Taoiseach, who is appointed by the <b>President</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nomination of the lower house of parliament, the Dáil. Members of the government are chosen from both the Dáil and the upper house of parliament, the Seanad. Its capital is Dublin.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{convened in}} Chicago and {{nominated}} former Speaker of the House James G. Blaine of Maine for <b>president</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fourth ballot. Blaine's nomination alienated many Republicans who viewed Blaine as ambitious and immoral. The GOP standard bearer was weakened by alienating the Mugwumps, and the Conkling faction, recently disenfranchised by President Arthur. Democratic party leaders saw the Republicans' choice {{as an opportunity}} to win the White House {{for the first time since}} 1856 if the right candidate could be found.|$|E

5|$|When the Republican {{convention}} {{began in}} Philadelphia that June, no {{vice presidential candidate}} had overwhelming support, but Roosevelt had the broadest range of support from around the country. McKinley affirmed that the choice belonged to the convention, not to him. On June 21, McKinley was unanimously renominated and, with Hanna's reluctant acquiescence, Roosevelt was nominated for vice <b>president</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first ballot. The Democratic convention convened the next month in Kansas City and nominated William Jennings Bryan, setting up a rematch of the 1896 contest.|$|E
5|$|Among Breckinridge's {{supporters}} at the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina, {{were several}} prominent Kentuckians. They were former Kentucky Governor and current Senator Lazarus W. Powell, former Kentucky Congressmen William Preston (a distant relative) and law partner James Brown Clay, and James B. Beck. Breckinridge {{did not attend}} the convention, but instructed his supporters not to nominate him as long as James Guthrie remained a candidate. Accordingly, when a delegate from Arkansas nominated Breckinridge for <b>president</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> thirty-sixth ballot, Beck asked that it be withdrawn, and the request was honored. Over the course of 57 ballots, Douglas maintained a wide plurality, but failed to gain the necessary two-thirds majority; Guthrie consistently ran second. Unable to nominate a candidate, delegates voted to reconvene in Baltimore, Maryland on June 18.|$|E
5|$|In 1828, Bolívar {{issued a}} decree {{establishing}} his dictatorship in the country; as a result, {{a group of}} young lawyers gathered to depose Bolívar and proclaim Francisco de Paula Santander as constitutional <b>president.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> night of September 25, 1828 the conspirators attempted to assassinate Bolivar at the presidential palace; Bolívar managed to escape with the help of Manuela Sáenz by jumping from a window until the military forces restored control of the city. Pedro Carujo, born in Barcelona, became a Commander in 1828, hand picked by Simón Bolívar to lead the Military Academy founded in Bogotá. However, Carujo joined the supporters of Santander and attempted to kill Bolívar while on the revolt of September 25, for which he was sentenced to death and moved to the Solano fort in March 1829. After managing to escape several months later, he was recaptured and irons were attached to him. He was deported to Curacao in June 1830, only to return several months later under the government of José Antonio Páez.|$|E
