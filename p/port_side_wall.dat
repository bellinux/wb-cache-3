40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} facade flame heights from an under-ventilated enclosure fire having an opening with <b>side</b> <b>walls.</b> A reduced-scale model, consisting of a cubic enclosure of 0. 4 m with a vertical facade <b>wall</b> and two <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> was constructed for the experiments. The temperature profile inside the enclosure was measured by thermocouples whereas a CCD camera was employed to obtain the mean flame height of the ejected flames. It is found that the presence or the separation distance of the <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> have {{no impact on the}} critical heat release rate of the enclosure (1500 A √H in kW). The effects of the <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> on the mean flame height are pronounced for a relative larger flame than a small one having the same separation distance of the <b>side</b> <b>walls.</b> In addition as the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distance decreases, the effects become larger leading to flame heights much higher than those without sidewalls. A global dimensionless parameter K is proposed to account for the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> effects, based characteristic length scales of the opening, and the distance between the <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> D. The experimental data for different opening dimensions and <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distances are well correlated by this global parameter...|$|R

40|$|A small, lightweight, {{collapsible}} {{glove box}} enables its user to perform small experiments and other tasks. Originally {{intended for use}} aboard a space shuttle or the International Space Station (ISS), this glove box could also be attractive for use on Earth in settings in which work space or storage space is severely limited and, possibly, {{in which it is}} desirable to minimize weight. The development of this glove box was prompted by the findings that in the original space-shuttle or ISS setting, (1) it was necessary to perform small experiments in a large general-purpose work station, so that, in effect, they occupied excessive space; and it took excessive amounts of time to set up small experiments. The design of the glove box reflects the need to minimize the space occupied by experiments and the time needed to set up experiments, plus the requirement to limit the launch weight of the box and the space needed to store the box during transport into orbit. To prepare the glove box for use, the astronaut or other user has merely to insert hands through the two fabric glove <b>ports</b> in the <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> of the box and move two hinges to a locking vertical position (see figure). The user could do this while seated with the glove box on the user fs lap. When stowed, the glove box is flat and has approximately the thickness of two pieces of 8 -in.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> effects on facade flames ejected from the opening (such as a window) of an under-ventilated room fire. Experiments are carried out in a reduced-scale experimental setup, consisting of a cubic fire compartment having an opening with a vertical facade <b>wall</b> and two <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> normal to the façade wall. By changing the distance of the two <b>side</b> <b>walls,</b> the facade flame heights for different opening conditions (width, height) are recorded by a CCD camera. It is found that as the distance of the two <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> decreases the behavior the flame height can be distinguished into two regimes characterized by the dimensionless excess heat release rate, skew 5 dotQ_ex^ast See Formula in PDF, outside the opening: (a) for the “wall fire” (skew 5 dotQ_ex^ast See Formula in PDF ≤ 1. 3), the flame height is shown to change little with decrease of <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distance as the dominant entrainment is from the front direction (normal to the facade wall) independent of the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distances; (b) for the “axis-symmetrical fire” (5 dotQ_ex^ast > 1. 3), the flame height increases significantly with a decrease in <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distance as both the entrainment from the two side directions (parallel to the facade wall) and that from the front direction (normal to the facade wall) together apply. A global physically based non-dimensional factor K is then brought forward based on the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> constraint effect on the facade flame entrainment to characterize the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> effect on the flame height, by accounting for the dimensionless excess heat release rate, the characteristic length scales of the opening as well as the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> separation distance. The experimental data for different opening dimensions and <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distances collapse by using this global non-dimensional factor...|$|R

However, the comparison of shear layer growth rate and wall pressures reveal a better match with the two dimensional simulation results. This better match is explained on the basis of formation of oblique structures due to the presence of <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> which also suppress the distribution of momentum in third direction making the pressures to be higher as compared with the case without <b>side</b> <b>walls.</b> (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
