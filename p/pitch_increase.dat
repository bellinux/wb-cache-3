50|$|The pivoted arm {{produces}} {{yet another}} problem which {{is unlikely to}} be significant to the audiophile, though. As the master was originally cut in a linear motion from the edge towards the center, but the stylus on the pivoted arm always draws an arc, this causes a timing drift that is most significant when digitizing music and beat mapping the data for synchronization with other songs in a DAW or DJ software unless the software allows building a non-linear beat map. As the contact point of the stylus on the record wanders farther from the linear path between the starting point and center hole, the tempo and pitch tend to decrease towards the middle of the record, until the arc reaches its apex. After that the tempo and <b>pitch</b> <b>increase</b> towards the end as the contact point comes closer to the linear path again. Because the surface speed of the record is lower at the end, the relative speed error from the same absolute distance error is higher at the end, and the increase in tempo is more notable towards the end than the decrease towards the middle. This can be somewhat reduced by a curved arm pivoted so that the end point of the arc stays farther from the linear path than the starting point, or by a long straight arm that pivots perpendicularly to the linear path {{in the middle of the}} record. However the tempo droop at the middle can only be completely avoided by a linear tracking arm.|$|E

40|$|Software implementations: MATLAB : [URL] Julia : [URL] {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with an acoustical phenomenon called sweeping echo, which manifests itself in a room impulse response as a distinctive, continuous <b>pitch</b> <b>increase.</b> In this paper, it is shown that sweeping echoes are present (although to greatly varying degrees) in all perfectly rectangular rooms. The theoretical analysis {{is based on the}} rigid-wall image solution of the wave equation. Sweeping echoes are found to be caused by the orderly time-alignment of high-order reflections arriving from directions close to the three axial directions. While sweeping echoes have been previously observed in real rooms with a geometry very similar to the rectangular model (e. g. a squash court), they are not perceived in commonly encountered rooms. Room acoustic simulators such as the image method (IM) and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) correctly predict the presence of this phenomenon, which means that rectangular geometries should be used with caution when the objective is to model commonly encountered rooms. Small out-of-square asymmetries in the room geometry are shown to reduce the phenomenon significantly. Randomization of the image sources' position is shown to remove sweeping echoes without the need to model an asymmetrical geometry explicitly. Finally, the performance of three speech and audio processing algorithms is shown to be sensitive to strong sweeping echoes, thus highlighting the need to avoid their occurrence. status: publishe...|$|E

The transcriptomes of the four song nuclei and three auditory forebrain regions of these two groups were compared using microarray hybridizations, and the results were confirmed using in situ hybridization.

Of the differentially expressed genes, some have already been found to play a role, either directly or indirectly, in learning through previous studies, though most have still yet to have their properties determined. This study, though important in and of itself, is only the first of many pieces to the large process of vocal learning to be put into place; further work will be able to expand upon work here to fill in gaps in our knowledge of the vocal learning process...|$|E

40|$|Dispensing any fluid {{material}} onto a mixed technology {{printed circuit}} board (PCB) substrate has two basic requirements: applying the material to the exact location required, and dispensing a dot of exact volume. Due to the decreasing pad sizes, and the typical density required in the material pattern, these are major challenges [3]. There are two basic types of dispensing mechanisms that are used for practical production: the Archimedes Metering Valve (AMV) and the Positive Displacement Pump [5]. The performance of the Archimedes Screw in the AMV depends {{a great deal on}} screw design and operating conditions. The principle geometric variables of the Archimedes Screw are the channel depths, i. e., the radial distance between the cylinder surface and root diameter of the screw, the pitch of the screw, the type of threads and the number of channels through which the material can flow. The dimensions of the nozzle, such as the nozzle ID and stand off height, and the rheological properties of the material also influence the parameters required for a consistent dot. Dispensing with an AMV is based on the laws of momentum, fluid dynamics, energy, and mass transport. The amount of material dispensed depends upon the pitch of threads, depth of cut, type of thread, length of screw, the number of starts, and angle of rotation of the screw. The quantity of material dispensed increases with an increase in depth of cut, decrease in <b>pitch,</b> <b>increase</b> in encoder counts, and increasing the number of channels.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community at author's request from Jan. 18, 2013 - July 18, 2013 This thesis presents the results from Monte Carlo calculations on classical vector spins in face-centered-cubic (FCC) lattices. The goal {{of the study was}} to understand the effect of interlayer coupling, dilution of magnetic atoms in the lattice, and symmetry-changing strain. Experimental work by T. M. Giebultowicz et al. and J. A. Borchers et al. greatly inspired my work [1, 2]. J. A. Borchers's group studied NiO/CoO superlattices and observed that the magnetic order of CoO persisted above its Neel temperature due to the effect of interlayer coupling with NiO, which has a higher Neel temperature than CoO [1]. Simulating on a model of NiO/CoO bilayer reproduced the experimental results from Borchers et al. [1]. I concluded that exchange pinning on the NiO/CoO interface preserves the magnetic order of CoO above its Neel temperature significantly. Building on this initial result, a ferromagnet/antiferromagnet/ferromagnet (FM/AFM/FM) trilayer model was studied, where the ferromagnetic (FM) layers were antiferromagnetically coupled. First, I calculated the strength of the AF coupling as a function of the number of antiferromagnetic (AFM) spacer monolayers and concluded that the strength of AFM coupling decreases as the number of AFM spacer monolayers increases. Secondly, I added a uniaxial anisotropy to the model and obtained magnetization curves which exhibited hysteresis-like features with an external field and a first order magnetic transition. Lastly, I diluted the AFM spacer layer in the FM/AFM/FM trilayer by replacing magnetic spins with zero spins in the model. The dilution of AFM spacer layer caused fluctuations in the magnetization curves with external field but the strength of AFM coupling decreases as the number of AFM monolayers increases as in the nondiluted cases. The experimental results from T. M. Giebultowicz's group on MnSe/ZnTe superlattices by neutron scattering showed incommensurate helical spin order in MnSe, where MnSe layers were under tensile strain due to a small mismatching in the lattice parameter [2]. In addition, they observed that the pitch of the spin helix increased as the temperature increased [2]. I modeled the MnSe/ ZnTe system with Monte Carlo method and found that the pitch of the spin helix increased with temperature. In fact, the dependence of helix pitch on temperature was present regardless of the thickness of the sample, so I concluded that this <b>pitch</b> <b>increase</b> is not from the weakening of coupling of surface spin...|$|E

40|$|Currently, the {{composite}} materials (CM) {{are widely used}} in the aerospace technology and mechanical engineering where the key parameters characterizing structural components and articles are related to their weight characteristics {{as well as their}} performance under high temperatures. For the experimental investigation of composite-based threaded items, the rod-based 3 Dreinforced carbon-carbon composite material (CCCM) was chosen. The subject of the research was the metric thread. The test samples were cut of the aforesaid material along one of the reinforcement direction. The following thread sizes were analyzed: М 24 × 1. 5; М 24 × 2; М 24 × 3. Dependence of the thread strength on the number of thread turns was determined within the range of 1 to 10 thread turns for М 24 × 2 thread size. The remaining test samples were used to obtain the relationship between the thread load bearing capacity and the thread pitch. The obtained dependence of the thread load bearing capacity on the number of thread turns showed the following: a) An increment in the thread load bearing capacity decreases with increasing number of thread turns. However, this effect is less pronounced than that observed for the metal ‘screw/nut’ pair. b) With the CCCM material under study, it proved to be impossible to test configurations having only 1 or 2 thread turns. c) The wide confidence range (CR) of the failure load {{can be explained by the}} fact that the material under study features an apparent structural heterogeneity, with a different probability of hitting a unit cell of the matrix and filler of the material. Nevertheless, the confidence range is stable, thus indicating indirectly the possibility of using this test method for further study of composite-based threaded items. There is an explicit correlation between the thread load bearing capacity and the thread <b>pitch.</b> <b>Increase</b> in the thread strength with increasing thread pitch depends on the relationship between the pitch size and the characteristic size of the unit cell of the material.
