Threats include the drainage of wetlands, persecution and sport hunting, disturbance at the breeding colonies, and contamination by pesticides and heavy metals.|$|E
40|$|Physical {{inactivity}} is {{an increasing}} public policy issue throughout the United States. This study examines whether physical inactivity, and other wellness indicators, {{have an impact on}} the Human Development Index (HDI) of a county. The variables examined are percent of the <b>population</b> <b>that</b> is physically inactive, percent of the <b>population</b> <b>that</b> is obese, percent of population with access to exercise opportunities, number of fast food restaurants per 1000 population, percent of <b>population</b> <b>that</b> is African American, and percent of <b>population</b> <b>that</b> is Hispanic. We find that the percent of the <b>population</b> <b>that</b> is inactive and percent of the <b>population</b> <b>that</b> is obese both have a negative impact on the HDI of a county. The number of fast food restaurants per 1000 has a positive impact on the HDI of a county. None of the other variables used have a significant impact on HDI. Together, the three significant variables can explain about 43. 5 % of the variation in HDI. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?...|$|R

5|$|Most house sparrows do {{not move}} {{more than a few}} {{kilometres}} during their lifetimes. However, limited migration occurs in all regions. Some young birds disperse long distances, especially on coasts, and mountain birds move to lower elevations in winter. Two subspecies, P. d. bactrianus and P. d. parkini, are predominantly migratory. Unlike the birds in sedentary <b>populations</b> <b>that</b> migrate, birds of migratory subspecies prepare for migration by putting on weight.|$|E

5|$|Understanding {{the changes}} that have {{occurred}} during an organism's evolution can reveal the genes needed to construct parts of the body, genes which may be involved in human genetic disorders.

Breeding together different populations of this blind fish produced some offspring with functional eyes, since different mutations had occurred in the isolated <b>populations</b> <b>that</b> had evolved in different caves. This helped identify genes required for vision and pigmentation.|$|E

According to the IUCN 36 species are listed as vulnerable or worse, with ten critically endangered. Procellariids are threatened by introduced species on their breeding grounds, marine fisheries, pollution, exploitation and possibly by climate change.|$|E
5|$|A 2011 survey {{revealed}} that 78% of Croatians claim knowledge {{of at least}} one foreign language. According to a survey ordered by the European Commission in 2005, 49% of Croatians speak English as the second language, 34% speak German, and 14% speak Italian. French and Russian are spoken by 4% each, and 2% of Croatians speak Spanish. However, there are large municipalities that have minority languages that include substantial <b>populations</b> <b>that</b> speak these languages. An odd-majority of Slovenes (59%) have a certain level of knowledge of Croatian. The country is a part of various language-based international associations most notably, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie and the European Union Language Association.|$|E
5|$|A classic {{site for}} the study of biocolonisation from founder <b>populations</b> <b>that</b> arrive from outside (allochthonous), Surtsey was {{declared}} a nature reserve in 1965, while the eruption was still in active progress. Today only a few scientists are permitted to land on Surtsey; the only way anyone else can see it closely is from a small plane. This allows the natural ecological succession for the island to proceed without outside interference. In 2008, UNESCO declared the island a World Heritage Site, in recognition of its great scientific value.|$|E

5|$|Genetic testing results {{published}} in 2001 indicated that Namib Desert Horses {{are one of}} the most isolated horse populations in the world, with the second-lowest genetic variation of all horse <b>populations</b> <b>that</b> have been studied to date. In part, this is due to their small founding population, and generally small modern population, made smaller during periods of drought. Despite the large domesticated breeding population from which the horses originally descended, at least one genetic bottleneck has occurred in the breed's history, resulting in a significant decline in genetic variation over a relatively short period of time. Although an ideal minimum population size for genetic variability would be around 200 horses, the current range cannot support this population given the average rainfall. Estimates for a necessary minimum population to maintain genetic effectiveness range between 100 and 150 animals.|$|E
5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger <b>populations</b> <b>that</b> have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on the phenotype, or {{the observable}} characteristics of an organism, but the genetic (heritable) basis of any phenotype {{that gives a}} reproductive advantage may become more common in a population. Over time, this process can result in <b>populations</b> <b>that</b> specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation (the emergence of new species, macroevolution). In other words, natural selection is a key process {{in the evolution of}} a population. Natural selection can be contrasted with artificial selection, in which humans intentionally choose specific traits, whereas in natural selection there is no intentional choice.|$|E
