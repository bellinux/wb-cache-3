50|$|In Mexico, {{she says}} {{she fell in love}} with the country {{instantly}} and decided to stay permanently, wanting to provide a bicultural experience for her sons. Except for stays in the United States and Europe she has called Mexico home since. When she decided to live in Mexico, she was a single parent with one child who was ill and needed full-time care. She was not a <b>privileged</b> <b>foreigner,</b> but rather worked giving in English classes. She initially lived in a small town called San Lorenzo Acopilco located just west of Mexico City proper. It was difficult as the area was poor but she needed the peace and quiet it provided. She then moved to Mexico City because of the medical care that one of her sons needed. She became an English teacher in schools such as Garside and the Instituto Politecnico Nacional in Zacatenco. During these years, she never stopped painting but her focuses shifted from landscapes to people as she was impressed with the people she met in the country.|$|E
5|$|From 1254 to 1257, Edward {{was under}} the {{influence}} of his mother's relatives, known as the Savoyards, the most notable of whom was Peter of Savoy, the queen's uncle. After 1257, Edward increasingly fell in with the Poitevin or Lusignan faction – the half-brothers of his father HenryIII – led by such men as William de Valence. This association was significant, because the two groups of <b>privileged</b> <b>foreigners</b> were resented by the established English aristocracy, and they would be at the centre of the ensuing years' baronial reform movement. There were tales of unruly and violent conduct by Edward and his Lusignan kinsmen, which raised questions about the royal heir's personal qualities. The next years would be formative on Edward's character.|$|R
50|$|Apart from {{belonging}} to a vicious but honorable warrior clan known as the D'regs, he is later revealed to be the wali of Klatch, a Klatchian equivalent of a watchman {{on a par with}} Vimes. It also turns out his obsessive clove-chewing and broken Morporkian are in fact a disguise meant to delude foreigners into falsely assuming he is nothing but an uncivilized barbarian. Like many <b>privileged</b> <b>foreigners,</b> he was sent to the Assassins' Guild as a child on the assumption that he would get an excellent education. He confounds Vimes by his fond memories of Ankh-Morpork, and even Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler. He and Vimes eventually develop a wary respect for each other, mostly based on both of them being basically honest cops in unenviable positions.|$|R

50|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the Mennonites in Russia owned large agricultural estates and some had become successful as industrial entrepreneurs in the cities, employing wage labor. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Russian Civil War (1917-1921), all of these farms (whose owners were called Kulaks) and enterprises were expropriated by local peasants or the Soviet government. Beyond expropriation, Mennonites suffered severe persecution {{during the course of the}} Civil War, at the hands of workers, the Bolsheviks and, particularly, the Anarcho-Communists of Nestor Makhno, who considered the Mennonites to be <b>privileged</b> <b>foreigners</b> of the upper class and targeted them. During expropriation, hundreds of Mennonite men, women and children were murdered in these attacks. After the Ukrainian-Soviet War and the takeover of Ukraine by the Soviet Bolsheviks, people who openly practiced religion were in many cases imprisoned by the Soviet government. This led to a wave of Mennonite emigration to the Americas (U.S., Canada and Paraguay).|$|R
40|$|From the introduction]. In the EU, it is {{now well}} {{established}} that the various regimes of rights enjoyed by citizens are dispersed across the national and supranational levels. This is an empirical and not a normative observation, {{and it is not}} intended to pre-empt any further discussion about the theoretical possibility of a true ‘supranational citizenship’ in a world of nation states. But in fact, empirical observation shows that even in the sensitive arena of political rights, a multi-level system of rights allocation exists. Articles 19 (1) and 19 (2) EC interfere, in respect of municipal and European Parliamentary elections respectively, with the sovereignty of the Member States, by requiring that the states respect the equal treatment right of a citizen of the European Union (i. e. a national of one of the Member States) to vote and stand as a candidate under the same conditions as nationals when resident in a Member State of which she is not a national. So far as it is possible and reasonable to treat the EU as an emerging polity which has (at least descriptively speaking) some federal features, this dispersion of political rights across political levels is not really surprising. The EU’s treatment of electoral rights for non-national EU citizens is an important element of an overall package of measures concerned with intra-EU migration, drawing upon not only Articles 17 - 22 EC, but also the other treaty provisions which deal with the free movement of persons, and a variety of secondary legislative instruments (notable the Citizens’ Rights Directive of 20041). While it has long been one of the EU’s raisons d’être as part of the internal market project to ensure the equal treatment of nationals of other Member States as <b>privileged</b> <b>foreigners</b> (or so-called second country nationals) in the host Member State, the EU has also increasingly taken on a role in relation to aspects of the movement of third country nationals into and across (and out of) the Member States, not least by creating a Schengen Borders Code and a Schengen Visa and Information System applicable most of the pre- 2004 Member States. Stretching the limited competences conferred upon it by the Treaty of Amsterdam in this domain also into the realm of post-admission settlement and integration, the EU has adopted a Directive on long term resident third country nationals, 2 in which it has enacted a limited principle of non-discrimination for the benefit of groups of third country nationals who satisfy a minimum period of residence within the Member States. These developments highlight {{the extent to which the}} EU may be faced, in the future, with further challenges relating to the division of competences in relation to questions of immigration...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} devastating effects of the {{economic}} crisis has been the destruction of jobs, a situation that has {{a direct impact on}} the influx of foreign labor. The {{purpose of this article is}} to analyze the changes that have occurred in the access to the national labor market of immigrants in recent years, distinguishing between the two ordinary formulas of access and rooting as an extraordinary way, to finish with a very brief allusion to the facilitation of Entry and stay of foreigners for reasons of economic interest. The conclusion of this work is clear: the crisis has practically entailed the closure of the ordinary access routes to the work of foreigners, who are forced to go to extraordinary ways, also encountering serious problems in the renewal of authorizations, while Which has opened a <b>privileged</b> route for <b>foreigners</b> with resources and / or professional qualification...|$|R
40|$|Envisioning Eden uses {{international}} tourism as {{an analytical}} and ethnographic lens to disentangle the intricate {{ways in which}} processes of globalization and localization intersect, overlap, and clash. Destinations of travel worldwide are adapting themselves to the homogenizing service standards of tourism {{while at the same}} time trying to maintain, or even increase, their own distinctiveness. Central to these deeply intertwined processes are tourism imaginaries, understood as representational systems that mediate reality and form identities, and their (re) production by local tour guides, key agents in the selling and telling of natural and cultural heritage. Based on over two years of fieldwork in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and Arusha, Tanzania, this book offers an in-depth examination of local-to-global dynamics in the context of contemporary tourism. The author examines each destination in all its particularity, illustrating how tour guide narratives and practices are informed by widely circulating imaginaries of the past and personal fantasies of the future. A comparative and discourse-centred analysis reveals how local guides in Yogyakarta and Arusha assure the continued reproduction and localization of tourism fantasies, but also how they use the <b>privileged</b> contact with <b>foreigners</b> to foment their own imaginations of ‘paradise on earth’. The book’s focus on the human mechanics of globalization, on cosmopolitan mobility, and on the role of the imaginary in giving people’s lives meaning, illustrates some creative ways in which anthropologies of tourism and travel can contribute to ongoing theoretical and methodological debates about the local-global nexus. This insightful work will be essential to readers interested in culture contact, globalization, cosmopolitan mobility, and tourism. nrpages: 264 status: publishe...|$|R
