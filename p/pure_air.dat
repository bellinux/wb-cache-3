5|$|While The Loves of the Plants {{celebrates the}} natural world and {{advances}} several scientific hypotheses regarding {{the formation of the}} cosmos, the moon and the earth, The Economy of Vegetation celebrates scientific progress and technological innovation, such as the forging of steel, the invention of the steam engine and the improvements to gunpowder. It depicts scientists and inventors, such as Benjamin Franklin, responsible for this progress as the heroes of a new age; he “mythologizes” them. The poem at some points goes further, into what would now be called science fiction, forecasting that the British Empire will have giant steam-powered airships ("The flying-chariot through the fields of air. Fair crews triumphant, leaning from above") and far-ranging submarines ("Britain's sons shall guide | Huge sea-balloons beneath the tossing tide; The diving castles, roof'd with spheric glass, Ribb'd with strong oak, and barr'd with bolts of brass, Buoy'd with <b>pure</b> <b>air</b> shall endless tracks pursue").|$|E

Its design included a secondary ground-attack capability that was largely unused. The aircraft design proved flexible enough that an all-weather strike derivative, the F-15E Strike Eagle, an improved and enhanced version, which was later developed entered service in 1989 and exported to several nations. As of 2017, the aircraft is being produced in different variants with production set {{to end in}} 2022.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Norris, at {{the time}} living with his birth parents, visited {{the home of a}} female {{relative}} in her early twenties and began talking in sexually suggestive terms to her. In response, this relative ordered him to leave her house. Norris' father was informed of this incident, and threatened to beat his son. In response, Norris stole his father's car and drove into the Rocky Mountains, where he attempted to commit suicide by injecting <b>pure</b> <b>air</b> into an artery in his arm. He was later apprehended as a runaway, and returned to live with his parents. When he returned home, his parents informed Norris that he and his younger sister were both unwanted children, and that they had intended to divorce when both children reached adolescence.|$|E

25|$|Pasteur {{performed}} {{several experiments}} to disprove spontaneous generation. He placed boiled liquid in a flask and let hot air enter the flask. Then {{he closed the}} flask, and no organisms grew in it. In another experiment, when he opened flasks containing boiled liquid, dust entered the flasks, causing organisms to grow in some of them. The number of flasks in which organisms grew was lower at higher altitudes, showing that air at high altitudes contained less dust and fewer organisms. Pasteur also used swan neck flasks containing a fermentable liquid. Air was allowed to enter the flask via a long curving tube that made dust particles stick to it. Nothing grew in the broths unless the flasks were tilted, making the liquid touch the contaminated walls of the neck. This showed that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, on dust, rather than spontaneously generating within the liquid or from the action of <b>pure</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In the lab {{he came up}} {{with the}} {{following}} simple way to obtain [...] "optically pure" [...] air, i.e. air that has no visible signs of particulate matter. He built a square wooden box with a couple of glass windows on it. Before closing the box, he coated the inside walls and floor of the box with glycerin, which is a sticky syrup. He found that after a few days' wait the air inside the box was entirely particulate-free when examined with strong light beams through the glass windows. The various floating-matter particulates had all ended up getting stuck to the walls or settling on the sticky floor. Now, in the optically <b>pure</b> <b>air</b> there were no signs of any [...] "germs", i.e. no signs of floating micro-organisms. Tyndall sterilised some meat-broths by simply boiling them, and then compared what happened when he let these meat-broths sit in the optically <b>pure</b> <b>air,</b> and in ordinary air. The broths sitting in the optically <b>pure</b> <b>air</b> remained [...] "sweet" [...] (as he said) to smell and taste after many months of sitting, while the ones in ordinary air started to become putrid after a few days. This demonstration extended Louis Pasteur's earlier demonstrations that the presence of micro-organisms is a precondition for biomass decomposition. However, the next year (1876) Tyndall failed to consistently reproduce the result. Some of his supposedly heat-sterilized broths rotted in the optically <b>pure</b> <b>air.</b> From this Tyndall was led to find viable bacterial spores (endospores) in supposedly heat-sterilized broths. He discovered the broths had been contaminated with dry bacterial spores from hay in the lab. All bacteria are killed by simple boiling, except that bacteria have a spore form that can survive boiling, he correctly contended, citing research by Ferdinand Cohn. Tyndall found a way to eradicate the bacterial spores that {{came to be known as}} [...] "Tyndallization". Tyndallization historically was the earliest known effective way to destroy bacterial spores. At the time, it affirmed the [...] "germ theory" [...] against a number of critics whose experimental results had been defective from the same cause. During the mid-1870s Pasteur and Tyndall were in frequent communication.|$|E

2500|$|Although the Sea Fury {{had been}} {{originally}} {{developed as a}} <b>pure</b> <b>air</b> superiority fighter, the Royal Navy viewed the solid construction and payload capabilities of the airframe as positive attributes for ground attack as well, accordingly Hawker tested and cleared the type to use {{a wide range of}} armaments and support equipment. Each aircraft had four wing-mounted 20mm Hispano V cannon, with up to 16 rocket projectiles, or a combination of 500lb or 1000lb bombs being carried too. Other loads included 1000lb incendiary bombs, mines, type 2 smoke floats or 90 gallon fuel tanks. [...] The Sea Fury could also be fitted with both vertical and oblique cameras and a dedicated control box in the cockpit, for photo reconnaissance missions. Other ancillary equipment included chaff to evade hostile missile attack and flares.|$|E
2500|$|When red cells {{reach the}} end of their life due to aging or defects, they are removed from the {{circulation}} by the phagocytic activity of macrophages in the spleen or the liver or hemolyze within the circulation. Free hemoglobin is then cleared from the circulation via the hemoglobin transporter CD163, which is [...] exclusively expressed on monocytes or macrophages. Within these cells the hemoglobin molecule is broken up, and the iron gets recycled. This process also produces one molecule of carbon monoxide for every molecule of heme degraded. Heme degradation {{is one of the few}} natural sources of carbon monoxide in the human body, and is responsible for the normal blood levels of carbon monoxide even in people breathing <b>pure</b> <b>air.</b> The other major final product of heme degradation is bilirubin. Increased levels of this chemical are detected in the blood if red cells are being destroyed more rapidly than usual. Improperly degraded hemoglobin protein or hemoglobin that has been released from the blood cells too rapidly can clog small blood vessels, especially the delicate blood filtering vessels of the kidneys, causing kidney damage.|$|E

2500|$|Walter Scott {{referenced}} {{the village}} in [...] "Rokeby" [...] (1813), an epic poem set in the area. The artist J. M. W. Turner made several sketches of the castle on 13 July 1816. The Wesleyan chapel was built in 1822 and is the oldest chapel in the Richmond circuit. From 1834, the parish was placed within the Poor Law Union of Richmond. A national school was built in 1841. The blacksmith's shop has been situated at the same site since 1841. In 1843 the parish was described as being almost entirely agricultural. The Bay Horse Inn public house dates {{as far back as}} at least 1857 (it claims a date of 1725), and its stone door case is 17th century or earlier, almost certainly built using material from the castle. In 1859 [...] "good [...] " [...] was being quarried in the village, although a short-lived copper mine had been discontinued; the father of Christopher Cradock was lord of the manor, and the village was described as [...] "exceedingly neat".

2500|$|In 1901, the cool, {{supposedly}} <b>pure</b> <b>air</b> of Luray Caverns {{was forced}} through {{the rooms of}} the Limair Sanatorium, erected on the summit of Cave Hill by Colonel T.C.

On the hottest day in summer, the interior of the house was kept at a cool and comfortable [...] By sinking a shaft [...] in diameter down to a cavern chamber and installing a [...] fan powered by a [...] electric motor, Northcott's system could change out the air through the entire house about every four minutes. [...] Tests made over successive years by means of culture media and sterile plates were considered to have demonstrated the [...] "perfect bacteriologic purity" [...] of the air, purportedly a benefit to those suffering various respiratory illnesses. This [...] "purity" [...] was explained by a natural filtration process with air drawn into the caverns through myriad rocky crevices, then further cleansing by air floating over the transparent springs and pools, the product finally being supplied to the inmates of the sanatorium. The [...] "Limair" [...] burned down in the early 1900s but was subsequently rebuilt as a brick building.

2500|$|Although Kellogg praised hydropathy for {{its many}} uses, he did {{acknowledge}} its limits. [...] "In nearly all cases, sunlight, <b>pure</b> <b>air,</b> rest, exercise, proper food, and other hygienic agencies are quite {{as important as}} water. Electricity, too, is a remedy which should not be ignored; and skillful surgery is absolutely indispensable in not {{a small number of}} cases." [...] With this belief, he went on to criticize many medical figures who misused or overestimated hydropathy in the treating of disease. Among these, he criticized what he referred to as [...] "Cold-Water Doctors" [...] who would recommend the same remedy regardless of the type of ailment or temperament of the patient. These doctors would prescribe ice cold baths in unwarmed rooms even during the harshest winters. In his opinion, his prejudicial approach to illness resulted in converting hydropathy a more heroic type of treatment where many became obsessed with taking baths in ice cold baths. He addresses the negative consequences that resulted from this [...] "infatuation," [...] among them tuberculosis and other diseases. This dangerous habit was only exacerbated by physicians who used hydropathy in excess. Kellogg recounts an instance where a patient with a low typhus fever was treated with thirty-five cold packs while in a feeble state and, not to the surprise of Kellogg, died. Kellogg posits this excessive and dangerous use of hydropathy as a return to the [...] "violent processes" [...] of bloodletting, antimony, mercury and purgatives. Kellogg also criticizes the ignorance in [...] "Hydropathic Quacks" [...] as well as in Preissnitz, the founder of modern hydropathy, himself. Kellogg states that the [...] "Quacks" [...] as well as Preissnitz are ignorant for overestimating the hydropathy as a [...] "cure-all" [...] remedy without understanding the true nature of disease.|$|E
