40|$|ABSTRACT Deficiency in {{phenylalanine}} hydroxylase (PAH) is {{the main}} molecular characteristic of phenylketonuria (PKU). So far over 500 different mutations in the PAH gene {{have been identified as}} associated with the disease. Mutation analysis of the PAH gene is a time-consuming and cost-effective procedure. Therefore, molecular markers which are highly linked to the PAH gene, have been used in carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis in PKU families. These markers show a population dependent based haplotype frequency. In the present study, the haplotype frequency of three markers including BglII, EcoRI and VNTR, at the PAH gene region were investigated in Iranian population. Nine different alleles for VNTR marker with 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13 core repeats were detected. Alleles 4 and 13 were found specific to the Iranian population. The haplotype frequency was calculated using FBAT, PHASE and Arlequin (haplotype frequency estimation computer programs). Among the 36 possible estimated haplotypes identified for 2 alleles (+ and-) for BglII and EcoRI; and nine alleles for VNTR, ten haplotypes showed relatively high frequency (e ” 5 %), based on the above programs. Therefore, a combination of BglII-EcoRI-VNTR could be suggested as an informative haplotype in <b>performing</b> <b>carrier</b> and prenatal diagnosis of the PAH gene mutations in Iranian population...|$|E

40|$|The {{industry}} of shipping reaches {{far back in}} time but the traditional view with a shipowner offering his services is a mere memory. Developing from one actor offering all services more and more players have taken a role in shipping and the new industry {{that we have seen}} develop over the last 150 years consists of several parties carrying out different functions. Someone does of course own the ship but this is no longer equal to being the party carrying out the transport. More likely, the shipowner is only a name on a paper unaware of the actual shipping involvements on a specific level. Irrespective of which one of these two extremes we are faced with one thing is sure; the functions relevant for shipping today differ from the traditional arrangements. A changing industry requires new tools in order to function efficiently. This concerns everything from communication, financial setups to legal solutions that are in line with the structure we see today. In this thesis the focus is on how the legal solutions can help the market or the industry to work as efficiently as possible and in order to do so {{it is important that the}} content is desirable seen from a practical perspective. Furthermore it is important that the desirable position is unambiguously expressed. This will be the main focus in the following discussion. Concerning trade in bulk, chartering is the reality of today. A carrier enters into a chartering agreement with a charterer. This chartering agreement can be based on transport between destinations, on a specific time or on another basis the parties find appropriate to fulfil their requirements. The point being that there are many different ways to organize your trade today but common to all of them is that they will in almost every case start with a charter party. There are numerous interesting legal issues in regard of charter parties and in this thesis only one of them will be assessed. This is the question of liability. When we have a chain of charter party relationships governed by different terms and transport document between the charterer and a receiver in the end, it follows from the very nature of these contractual relationships that the issue of liability is central and complex. Who are the liable parties in this structure? The starting point for chartering is that this is an area of freedom of contract. The rational for this being that the parties involved are professionals with insight in the industry. With this said the position evaluated in this thesis is the legal position under the maritime code. Apart from the contracts this is the main legal source and it supplements all different contracts when they are silent or unclear. Furthermore it stipulates mandatory rules for some transport. The liability under the maritime code concerning charter parties is regulated in chapter 14. Either the liability derives from the charter party or from a tramp bill of lading. These are the two main documents governing this kind of transport. The carrier can be liable as contractual carrier or as <b>performing</b> <b>carrier</b> depending on whether or not the relationship to the contractual party is directly contractual or based on performance. When the document governing the transport of goods is a charter party the liability of the carrier concerning damaged or delayed goods is regulated in section 347 and section 383. The rules relating to charter parties are materially the same for both time- and voyage chartering in the code. In the first subparagraph the carrier s liability towards the charterer is regulated. The carrier is defined as the person who, through a contract, charters out a ship to another (the charterer). If the <b>performing</b> <b>carrier</b> is someone else than the carrier this party is caught by the reference to section 286 made in section 347 and 383 first subparagraph second sentence. The effect of the first section is in conclusion that the charterer has a claim for damaged or delayed cargo towards the carrier and the <b>performing</b> <b>carrier,</b> if this is not the same party. In the second subparagraph the carrier s and the <b>performing</b> <b>carrier</b> s liability towards a receiver who is not the charterer is regu-lated. When we have a bill of lading issued under a charter party, a tramp bill of lading, and this is endorsed to someone else than the charterer, this party s rights towards the issuer follow from the bill of lading. This is stipulated in section 325 in the maritime code. In order to establish the liability under a tramp bill of lading there are two main questions that has to be answered. First, when the carrier is bound by a tramp bill of lading. In this concern it is the distinction from liner trade that is important as the rules of presumption might result in different parties being bound by the master s signature. The evaluation depends on whether it is liner trade or chartering. Secondly, it is a question about the consequences when the carrier is bound. Or expressed in another way, the substance of the liability. In this thesis these rules will be evaluated from a practical basis according to the commercial patterns in the shipping industry. Who is the carrier under different aspects and more importantly, is the legal position of today also the desirable one seen from a practical perspective? By this I mean that if eth liability following from statute is in line with the structure we see under different charter parties. Is it reasonable that the targeted party under the code is held liable when looking at the contractual or actual functions undertaken...|$|E
30|$|The basic {{distributed}} {{coordination function}} (DCF), defined in Section 9.2. 7 of the IEEE 802.11 protocol specification [5], {{has been used}} as a de facto MAC for broadcast applications in distributed wireless networks. Hereafter, it will be referred to as a B-MAC. It uses a temporal contention window-based channel arbitration mechanism along with carrier sense multiple access (CSMA). Note that the rationale behind using the contention window, even after <b>performing</b> <b>carrier</b> sensing, is to mandate contending users to access the channel only after a further deferral (random backoff) period which would possibly avoid concurrent transmissions (literally, packet collisions) from multiple contending users. Note that the efficiency of such a collision avoidance mechanism depends on two factors: the size of the contention window and the number of contending users. For a given size of the contention window, the collision probability increases with an increase in the contending population size. As a consequence, the throughput efficiency of the network decreases. Moreover, because of the large number of destinations in broadcast operation, unlike the single destination in unicast operation, simultaneously acknowledging reception from multiple destinations is not feasible. Therefore, the transmitting user cannot know whether the transmitted packet has safely reached its destinations. Thus, B-MAC does not invoke MAC layer retransmission or recovery for the collided packets as its unicast counterpart does. Therefore, broadcast reliability (in terms of successful reception at destinations) also quickly decreases with an increase in contending population size.|$|E

In this paper, {{we are able to}} determine the initial phase of a carrier sine wave by <b>performing</b> <b>carrier</b> recovery loop in Digital communication systems of M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) schemes. It is important for the M-ary QAM carrier recovery circuits to have low phase jitter as well as only four stable phase points as we see below.

We saw the symbols on the 3 D Eye Diagram and constellation plot begin to jitter at first, and then settle closer to the ideal symbol locations after a short period of time. Authors of this article present real results, which illustrate the link between number of symbols in M-state QAM modulation, SNR and BER.

40|$|From {{the issue}} {{entitled}} "Special Issue on Embedded Signal Processing Circuits and Systems for Cognitive Radio-Based Wireless Communication Devices"International audienceThe increasing demands for wireless communication especially in consumer electronics applications, result in substantially and continuously increasing reliability and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This trend creates {{a need to}} introduce intelligent functionalities in the wireless devices, {{which leads to the}} concept of Cognitive Radio (CR) technology. In some CR applications such as Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA), the CR terminal should be able to modify its transmission parameters in order to communicate with an efficient utilization of the spectrum resource. In such a case, the CR terminal would be capable of reconfiguring itself with minimum supplementary information to achieve best performance. In this paper we propose a blind carrier recovery loop with respect to the modulation scheme suited to CR applications. Unlike conventional solutions which use a separate modulation identification device before <b>performing</b> <b>carrier</b> recovery, the introduced loop employs a hierarchical symbol decision to achieve phase lock, and then the S-curve and the variance of a Decision-Directed phase error detector are used to extract an information about the modulation scheme of the incoming signal. After the phase lock with the hierarchical decision the constellation used in the received signal is detected and then the true decisions are used to drive the recovery loop. Results obtained with different digital linear modulations (8 -PSK, 16 -QAM, 16 -APSK, 64 -QAM) indicate that the introduced loop is capable of achieving a real-time modulation scheme detection as well as keeping phase lock in case of adaptive modulation scheme transmissions...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} the result of a masters thesis {{performed}} at Linköping University for Saab Bofors Dynamics in Linköping, Sweden. Attitude is defined as the orientation of a coordinate frame in reference to another coordinate frame. This is often referred to as three consecutive rotations, called roll, pitch and yaw (or heading). Attitude determination is generally performed using inertial navigation systems composed of gyros and accelerometers. These systems are highly accurate but are very expensive and experience a drift when used for a long period of time. The global positioning system, or GPS, was developed by the US military to determine a user’s position, velocity and time. These parameters can all be determined by performing measurements on the GPS satellite signal code that is modulated onto the GPS satellite signal carrier. But the GPS signal can also be use to determine attitude by <b>performing</b> <b>carrier</b> measurements for two or more GPS antennas. When determining the relative position between two antennas, by measuring the phase difference between them, information of the baseline is attained. The calculated baseline will be in a local navigation frame. By rotating it to the known body frame, a rotation matrix known as a direction coordinate matrix, or DCM, will be attained. From this rotation matrix, only two of the three attitude angles can be calculated, since the third rotation is about the baseline’s own axis. Using three or more antennas (two or more baselines), all three attitude angles can be determined from the DCM. This thesis work included development of a hardware platform carrying four NovAtel Superstar II GPS receivers. The platform enables serial communications between the receivers and a PC, as well as providing the supply for the receivers and antennas. The attitude determination algorithm was written and tested using a test platform mounted onto a car. The result shows a one degree deviation from an INS reference system in heading and pitch during both static and dynamic tests. The roll angle was not measured during the test drives because only one baseline was locked. The GPS based attitude determination system performed well when the baselines were locked, but it requires some improvements for full functionality...|$|E

Equalization complexity prevents any substantial rate improvement with the existing single-carrier approach, as the channel frequency selectivity increases considerably when the symbol rate increases. Multicarrier modulation {{in the form of}} orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), on the other hand, converts a frequency selective channel into a set of parallel frequencyflat subchannels, thus greatly simplifying receiver equalization. Motivated by the success of OFDM in radio channels, we investigate its use for underwater acoustic channels.
