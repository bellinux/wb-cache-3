5|$|Worldwide {{identified}} {{reserves in}} 2008 were {{estimated by the}} US Geological Survey (USGS) to be 13 million tonnes, though an accurate estimate of world lithium reserves is difficult. One {{reason for this is}} that most lithium classification schemes are developed for solid ore deposits, whereas brine is a fluid that is problematic to treat with the same classification scheme due to varying concentrations and pumping effects. The world has been estimated to contain about 15 million tonnes of lithium reserves, while 65 million tonnes of known resources are reasonable. A total of 75% of everything can typically be found in the ten largest deposits of the world. Another study noted that 83% of the geological resources of lithium are located in six brine, two <b>pegmatite,</b> and two sedimentary deposits.|$|E
40|$|Many rare metals {{used today}} {{are derived from}} {{granitic}} <b>pegmatites,</b> but debate continues {{about the origin of}} these rocks. It is clear that some <b>pegmatites</b> represent the most highly fractionated products of a parental granite body, whilst others have formed by anatexis of local crust. However, the importance of these two processes in the formation of rare-metal <b>pegmatites</b> is not always evident. The Lewisian Gneiss Complex of NW Scotland comprises Archaean meta-igneous gneisses which were highly reworked during accretional and collisional events in the Palaeoproterozoic (Laxfordian orogeny). Crustal thickening and subsequent decompression led to melting and the formation of abundant granitic and pegmatitic sheets {{in many parts of the}} Lewisian Gneiss Complex. This paper presents new petrological, geochemical and age data for those <b>pegmatites</b> and shows that, whilst the majority are barren biotite-magnetite granitic <b>pegmatites,</b> a few muscovite-garnet (rare-metal) <b>pegmatites</b> are present. These are mainly intruded into a belt of Palaeoproterozoic metasedimentary and meta-igneous rocks known as the Harris Granulite Belt. The rare-metal <b>pegmatites</b> are distinct in their mineralogy, containing garnet and muscovite, with local tourmaline and a range of accessory minerals including columbite and tantalite. In contrast, the biotite-magnetite <b>pegmatites</b> have biotite and magnetite as their main mafic components. The rare-metal <b>pegmatites</b> are also distinguished by their bulk-rock and mineral chemistry, including a more peraluminous character and enrichments in Rb, Li, Cs, Be, Nb and Ta. New U-Pb ages (c. 1690 – 1710 Ma) suggest that these rare-metal <b>pegmatites</b> are within the age range of nearby biotite-magnetite <b>pegmatites,</b> indicating that similar genetic processes could have been responsible for their formation. The peraluminous nature of the rare-metal <b>pegmatites</b> strongly points towards a metasedimentary source. Notably, within the Lewisian Gneiss Complex, such <b>pegmatites</b> are only found in areas where a metasedimentary source is available. The evidence thus points towards all the Laxfordian <b>pegmatites</b> being formed by a process of crustal anatexis, with the formation of rare-metal <b>pegmatites</b> being largely controlled by source composition rather than solely by genetic process. This is in keeping with previous studies that have also challenged the widely accepted model that all rare-metal <b>pegmatites</b> are formed by fractionation from a parental granite, and raises questions about the origin of other mineralised <b>pegmatites</b> worldwide. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{swarm of}} {{granitic}} <b>pegmatites</b> occurs in Mzimba district from northern Kasungu to Kafukure near the western international border with Zambia. The granitic <b>pegmatites</b> are hosted by a mobile belt, within the Mozambiquan orogenic belt (c. 900 - 1800 Ma). They have been dated as 485 Ma. They intruded metasediments of high to medium grade metamorphic rocks of a Precambrian Basement Complex. The dominant {{trend of the}} <b>pegmatites</b> is NW - SE, exhibiting a cross-cutting relationship with the country rocks and their contacts with the latter are usually sharp. The six <b>pegmatites</b> investigated {{in this study are}} inhomogeneous, composed of a massive quartz core, an intermediate zone composed of a blocky pink K-feldspar rich sub-zone and muscovite rich sub-zone and a wall zone composed of quartz - pink K-feldspar - muscovite mineral assemblage. The Mzimba <b>pegmatites</b> are classified as lithium-caesium-tantalum (LCT) family of rare element granitic <b>pegmatites</b> as described by Černý and Ercit (2005). They belong to the beryl-columbite subtype and beryl-columbite-phosphate subtype of the rare element <b>pegmatites.</b> It is suggested that the <b>pegmatites</b> are the product of magmatic differentiation and that they form roofs of granite plutons lying deep below the current level of erosion. The six <b>pegmatites</b> were sampled and minerals analysed using standard analytical methods such as petrographic microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis. Mineralogy of the granitic <b>pegmatites</b> indicates that they are predominantly composed of perthitic K-feldspar (perthite), Na-plagioclase (albite), quartz and muscovite as main mineral phases and accessory minerals including beryl, tantalite-columbite (ferrotantalite), iron-titanium oxides (ilmeno-rutile and ilmenite), tourmaline (schorl), garnet (almandine-spessartine) and triplite. Triplite is a very rare mineral found in a few <b>pegmatites</b> around the world, {{and this is the first}} reported account of this mineral in the Mzimba <b>pegmatites</b> and probably in Malawi. These minerals are being exploited by artisanal and small scale miners. Trace elements in K-feldspar and muscovite are significant indicators for the evaluation of economic potential of <b>pegmatites</b> as well as for the differentiation degree and origin of the magma. The K/Rb ratio for K-feldspars ranges between 12. 72 and 109. 38, while for muscovites it is between 16. 66 and 82. 36 indicating that the <b>pegmatites</b> are moderately evolved. The Ta versus Cs and the Ta versus K/Cs discrimination diagram indicates that all the investigated <b>pegmatites</b> plot above the 20 ppm threshold suggesting that the <b>pegmatites</b> have potential for Ta and Nb mineralization...|$|R

5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{has some}} of the most ancient rocks found in any U.S. National Park. The oldest rocks dated so far are 2,680 ± 12million years old, though even older rocks are {{believed}} to exist in the park. Formed during the Archean Eon (4 to 2.5billion years ago), these metamorphic rocks include gneiss, schist and amphibolites. Metamorphic rocks are the most common types found in the northern and southern sections of the Teton Range. 2,545million years ago, the metamorphic rocks were intruded by igneous granitic rocks, which are now visible in the central Tetons including Grand Teton and the nearby peaks. The light colored granites of the central Teton Range contrast with the darker metamorphic gneiss found on the flanks of Mount Moran to the north. Magma intrusions of diabase rocks 765million years ago left dikes that can be seen on the east face of Mount Moran and Middle Teton. Granite and <b>pegmatite</b> intrusions also worked their way into fissures in the older gneiss. Precambrian rocks in Jackson Hole are buried deep under comparatively recent Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary deposits, as well as Pleistocene glacial deposits.|$|E

They intrude pre-Ordovician metasediments {{which were}} metamorphosed to sillimanite-zone conditions near the Lumbrales granite. Field, mineralogical and petrographic data show the following zonal sequence from the granite outward: (1) barren <b>pegmatites</b> (<b>pegmatites</b> T 1, T 2, T 3 and T 4) with quartz, K-feldspar> albite, muscovite, tourmaline + andalusite + garnet; (2) intermediate <b>pegmatites</b> (types T 5 and T 6), {{characterized by the}} occurrence of beryl and Fe-Mn-Li phosphates; and (3) fertile <b>pegmatites</b> (dykes T 7 and T 8), with lepidolite, cassiterite, columbite, albite> K-feldspar, montebrasite and spodumene.

40|$|Abstract: The recent reinterpretation of the Lewisian Complex as {{a series}} of amalgamated terranes {{represents}} a significant advance in our understanding of these rocks. However, on the Outer Hebrides, a key observation that a supposed post- 1675 Ma terrane boundary is based on is flawed. Specifically, on South Harris a group of c. 1675 Ma granite <b>pegmatites</b> has previously been described as occurring only to the NE of, and terminating abruptly within, a supposed terrane-bounding shear zone (the Langavat Shear Zone), which thus post-dates the <b>pegmatites.</b> New mapping indicates that granite <b>pegmatites</b> occur on both sides of, and throughout the Langavat Shear Zone, and that within most of this shear zone the <b>pegmatites</b> are not strongly deformed, inconsistent with them predating this shear zone. Furthermore, new U–Pb geochronological data suggest that the <b>pegmatites</b> SW of the supposed boundary were also intruded around 1675 Ma, similar to those in the NE, and supporting the field evidence that the <b>pegmatites</b> continue through the Langavat Shear Zone without interruption. Two phases of post-pegmatite deformation are identified, but these relate to relatively minor reactivation of the Langavat Shear Zone, not the initiation of this major shear zone, which predates the <b>pegmatites...</b>|$|R
40|$|Four granulite-facies {{beryllium}} <b>pegmatites</b> of Late Archean age intrude ultrahigh-temperature Napier Complex metapelites in Khmara Bay at "Christmas Point" and "Zircon Point" and in Amundsen Bay on Mt. Pardoe. The <b>pegmatites</b> {{evolved in}} three major stages. During the first stage, melt from anatexis of sapphirine-bearing metapelites soon after temperatures peaked during ultrahigh-temperature metamorphism crystallized as <b>pegmatites</b> in inter-boudin spaces during the waning stages of associated deformation. The primary carrier of beryllium in the <b>pegmatites</b> {{at the time}} of their intrusion was a sapphirine-group mineral. The second stage is high-temperature metamorphism at moderate pressure, which resulted in reaction of sapphirine with quartz to form corona assemblages of sillimanite+orthopyroxene (or garnet) in the host rocks and sillimanite+garnet+ surinamite in the beryllium <b>pegmatites.</b> Previous investigators have attributed the corona assemblages to isobaric cooling following ultrahigh-temperature metamorphism, but the relatively large size of the coronas and their deformation in the <b>pegmatites</b> suggests that the coronas formed in both the host rocks and the <b>pegmatites</b> during a separate tectonothermal event. The third stage includes two metamorphic events at lower temperatures and moderate to low pressures when surimanite broke down to beryllian cordierite±Al-poor orthopyroxene. The presence of late-formed kyanite and andalusite in the <b>pegmatites</b> is consistent with decompression inferred by other investigators for these two events. Beryllium in the Late Archean <b>pegmatites</b> could have originated from the host granulites, which at "Christmas Point" and Mt. Pardoe have average Be contents of 3. 8 ± 2. 4 ppm and 3. 5 ± 1. 4 ppm, respectively. Beryllium content of host-rock sapphirine is 61 to 616 times whole-rock Be content, implying an important role for this mineral in supplying Be to the anatectic melt...|$|R

The <b>pegmatites</b> cross-cut host rocks in the Taba Metamorphic Complex (TMC) with sharp contacts and are divided into massive and zoned <b>pegmatites.</b> Massive <b>pegmatites</b> {{are the most common}} and form veins, dykes and masses of variable dimensions; strikes range mainly from E-W through NW-SE to N-S. Mineralogically, the massive <b>pegmatites</b> are divided into K-feldspar-rich and albite-rich groups. Zoned <b>pegmatites</b> occur as lenses of variable dimensions, featuring a quartz core, an intermediate zone rich in K-feldspars and an outer finer-grained zone rich in albite. All compositions are highly evolved and display geochemical characteristics of post-collisional A-type granites: high SiO 2, Na 2 O+K 2 O, FeO*/MgO, Ga/Al, Zr, Nb, Ga and Y alongside low CaO, MgO, Ba and Sr. They are rich in Rare Earth Elements (REE) and have extreme negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu*= 0. 03 – 0. 09). A genetic linkage between the <b>pegmatites,</b> aplites and alkali granite is confirmed by their common mild alkaline affinity and many other geochemical characteristics.

25|$|As magma cools, {{minerals}} typically crystallize {{from the}} melt at different temperatures (fractional crystallization). As minerals crystallize, {{the composition of}} the residual melt typically changes. If crystals separate from the melt, then the residual melt will differ in composition from the parent magma.

Gabbro may have a liquidus temperature near 1,200°C, and the derivative granite-composition melt may have a liquidus temperature as low as about 700°C. Incompatible elements are concentrated in the last residues of magma during fractional crystallization and in the first melts produced during partial melting: either process can form the magma that crystallizes to <b>pegmatite,</b> a rock type commonly enriched in incompatible elements. Bowen's reaction series is important for understanding the idealised sequence of fractional crystallisation of a magma.|$|E
