5|$|Sarah {{continued}} to appeal against court decisions which ruled that funding for Blenheim {{should come from}} the Marlboroughs' <b>personal</b> <b>estate,</b> and not the government. This made her unpopular; she could easily afford the payments herself. She {{was surprised by the}} grief she felt following the death of her eldest living daughter in 1733. Sarah lived to see her enemy Robert Walpole fall in 1742, and in the same year attempted to improve her reputation by approving a biographical publication titled An Account of the Dowager Duchess of Marlborough from her first coming to Court to the year 1710. She died of old age, at the age of eighty-four, on 18 October 1744, at Marlborough House; she was buried at Blenheim. Her husband’s body was exhumed from Westminster Abbey and buried beside her.|$|E
5|$|The {{operations}} became sizeable {{during the}} last quarter of the nineteenth century. Smith died in 1879, leaving an estate valued at under £45,000 (around £4.1 million in 2016 adjusted for inflation), and his assets were jointly inherited by his two brothers, William and Samuel Smith (a tanner). William purchased Samuel's share of his brother's <b>personal</b> <b>estate,</b> and built a modern brewery in 1883–4 at the cost of £130,000 (£9.7 million in 2013). By this time the company had a staff of over 100. William Smith died in 1886, and the firm was inherited in partnership by his two nephews, Henry Herbert (1863–1911) and Frank Riley, henceforth known as Riley-Smith under the terms of his will.|$|E
5|$|Former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson {{was named}} as Oxford's new manager, {{but was unable}} to prevent relegation to the Second Division. He was sacked three months into the 1988–89 Second Division {{campaign}} after a dispute with the chairman over the £1million sale of striker Dean Saunders to Derby County; Derby were owned by Robert Maxwell, father of the then Oxford United chairman, Kevin Maxwell. Following Robert Maxwell's death in 1991, his <b>personal</b> <b>estate,</b> including the club, became insolvent. After a long search for a new owner, during which BioMass Recycling Ltd took over the club, Brian Horton was named as Oxford's new manager. He remained in charge until September 1993, when he moved to Manchester City in the recently formed FA Premier League. Horton led United to mid-table finishes during his management spell, apart from a 21st-place finish {{at the end of the}} 1991–92 season. A 2–1 win over Tranmere Rovers, and a win for Blackburn Rovers over Plymouth Argyle, meant United survived relegation by two points. Oxford, now in the renamed Football League Division One, briefly restored Maurice Evans as manager, before turning to Bristol City manager Denis Smith. Despite Smith's efforts, Oxford was relegated to Division Two at the end of the 1993–94 season, with just four wins in the last eleven games.|$|E

Zhao rose to the rank of Minister of Works and positioned his protege Hu Zongxian as supreme commander, a role that Hu excelled in. Zhao, however, had earned the disdain of other figures in the court, and his disregard for etiquette alienated even Yan Song. After being accused of accepting bribes, exaggerating his victories, and diverting lumber meant for the Forbidden Palace towards the construction of his own <b>personal</b> <b>estate,</b> Zhao lost the Emperor's favor and was removed from his post.

40|$|Despite the {{commonality}} of {{the experience}} of inheritance and estate transfer across cultures and time, and despite the importance of charitable bequests to the sustainability of many charitable organisations, research into how and why people bequeath from their estates remains sporadic at best. Results of a recently published Australian empirical study (Baker and Gilding, 2011) support earlier findings in the US, the UK and Australia (Finch and Mason, 2000; Menchik and David, 1983; O'Dwyer, 2001) on the prevailing normative practice of bequeathing <b>personal</b> <b>estates</b> first to the surviving spouse and then to the children in equal share. The recent bequest data study also finds that very few decedents (5. 4 %) leave a charitable bequest. The non-inclusion of charities in estate distribution is in stark contrast with the very high rate (87 %) of participation by adult Australians in more general charitable giving (Giving Australia, 2005). This paper explores aspects of classical sociology and of giving theory for what this literature reveals as to why there should be such a discrepancy between during life charitable giving, inter vivos, and charitable giving from <b>personal</b> <b>estates,</b> post mortem...|$|R

25|$|By 1905 {{it could}} be stated that the {{national}} Government were supportive {{of the idea of}} setting up a University in Bristol. Here, two piece of fortune occurred. The Blind Asylum on Queen's Rd at the top of Park Street, where the Wills Memorial Building now stands, came up for sale. Travers picked up a telephone line which was shared with the Asylum and was able to eavesdrop and hear the conversation which stated that the Trustees were preparing to sell. Although with a price of £40,000 for the land it seemed unlikely the College could afford to purchase the plot, on 11 January 1906, William Travers was told by Lewis Fry that he had been promised the money to purchase the plot by several members of the Fry family and Wills Family: his brother Joseph Storrs Fry (£10,000), cousin Francis Fry (£5,000), Sir William Henry Wills (£10,000) and Sir Fredrick Wills (£5,000). It was the Wills and Fry families who were the chief benefactors of what became the University of Bristol. Joseph Storrs Fry was a successful businessman but the wealth of the Fry family was small in relation to that of the Wills. Frederick Wills had sat on University College councils and between 1900 and 1906 was the sitting MP for Bristol North, the seat that was previously occupied by Lewis Fry. William Henry Wills was first chairman of Imperial Tobacco and his families <b>personal</b> <b>estate</b> was estimated to make the Wills family one of the richest families in the land.|$|E
