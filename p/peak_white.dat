5000|$|This is a {{particular}} problem with digital cameras which often have a smaller dynamic range than film. In addition, digital sensors have an abrupt cut-off at the <b>peak</b> <b>white</b> level; sensor output typically increases linearly with incident light level until a <b>peak</b> <b>white</b> level, after which higher light levels result in the same peak output from the sensor. The response of film when the incident light is near the white level {{of the film is}} more gradual.|$|E

5000|$|The {{method for}} {{measuring}} ANSI lumens {{is defined in}} the IT7.215 document which was created in 1992. First the projector is set up to display an image in a room at a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius. The brightness and contrast of the projector are adjusted so that on a full white field, {{it is possible to}} distinguish between a 5% screen area block of 95% <b>peak</b> <b>white,</b> and two identically sized 100% and 90% <b>peak</b> <b>white</b> boxes {{at the center of the}} white field. The light output is then measured on a full white field at nine specific locations around the screen and averaged. This average is then multiplied by the screen area to give the brightness of the projector in [...] "ANSI lumens".|$|E

White Mountain contains sediment from a subcategory of the Green River Formation, known as the Wilkins Peak Formation.|$|E
50|$|Radiofax is {{transmitted}} in single sideband {{which is a}} refinement of amplitude modulation. The signal shifts up or down a given amount to designate white or black pixels. A deviation less than that for a white or black pixel is taken to be a shade of grey. With correct tuning (1.9 kHz below the assigned frequency for USB, above for LSB), the signal shares some characteristics with SSTV, with black at 1500 Hz and <b>peak</b> <b>white</b> at 2300 Hz.|$|E
5000|$|The foot-lambert {{is used in}} {{the motion}} picture {{industry}} for measuring the luminance of images on a projection screen.

50|$|The AGC circuit was problematic. First-generation AGC merely {{detected}} the average {{value of the}} transmitted signal; however, due to the positively modulated carrier, peak power represented <b>peak</b> <b>white</b> - not guaranteed to be present. Thus for a completely black picture, the AGC circuit would increase the RF gain to restore the average carrier amplitude. The result was a screen that was not black but mid-grey. In fact, the total light output of early TV sets was practically constant regardless of the picture content.|$|E

5000|$|The display driver chip has an RGB to RGBW color {{vector space}} {{converter}} and gamut mapping algorithm, followed by metamer and subpixel rendering algorithms. In {{order to maintain}} saturated color quality, to avoid simultaneous contrast error between saturated colors and <b>peak</b> <b>white</b> brightness, while simultaneously reducing backlight power requirements, the display backlight brightness is under control of the PenTile driver engine. [...] When the image is mostly desaturated colors, those near white or grey, the backlight brightness is significantly reduced, often to less than 50% peak, while the LCD levels are increased to compensate. When the image has very bright saturated colors, the backlight brightness is maintained at higher levels. The PenTile RGBW also has an optional high brightness mode that doubles {{the brightness of the}} desaturated color image areas, such as black&white text, for improved outdoor view-ability.|$|E
5000|$|The JPEG {{standard}} {{used for}} the compression coding in JFIF files does not define which color encoding {{is to be used}} for images. JFIF defines the color model to be used: either Y for greyscale, or YCbCr derived from RGB color primaries as defined in CCIR 601 (now known as Rec. ITU-R BT.601), except with a different [...] "full range" [...] scaling of the Y, Cb and Cr components. Unlike the [...] "studio range" [...] defined in CCIR 601, in which black is represented by Y=16 and white by Y=235 and values outside of this range are available for signal processing [...] "headroom" [...] and [...] "footroom", JFIF uses all 256 levels of the 8-bit representation, so that Y=0 for black and Y=255 for <b>peak</b> <b>white.</b> The RGB color primaries defined in JFIF via CCIR 601 also differ somewhat from what has become common practice in newer applications (e.g., they differ slightly from the color primaries defined in sRGB). Moreover, CCIR 601 (before 2007) did not provide a precise definition of the RGB color primaries; it relied instead on the underlying practices of the television industry.|$|E
