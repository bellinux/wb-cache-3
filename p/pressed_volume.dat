30|$|The {{mechanical}} {{performance of}} silicon shows a strong {{effect on the}} hillock formation on various silicon crystal planes. The crystal plane with the lower elastic modulus can lead to larger <b>pressed</b> <b>volume,</b> which facilitates more deformation in silicon matrix and higher hillock.|$|E
30|$|Although monocrystalline silicon reveals strong {{anisotropic}} properties {{on various}} crystal planes, the friction-induced nanofabrication can be successfully realized on Si(100), Si(110), and Si(111) surfaces. Under the same loading condition, the friction-induced hillock produced on Si(100) surface is the highest, while that produced on Si(111) surface is the lowest. The formation mechanism of hillocks on various silicon crystal planes can be {{ascribed to the}} structural deformation of crystal matrix during nanoscratching. The silicon crystal plane with lower elastic modulus can lead to larger <b>pressed</b> <b>volume</b> during sliding, facilitating more deformation in silicon matrix and higher hillock. Meanwhile, the structures of Si-Si bonds on various silicon crystal planes show a strong effect on the hillock formation. High density of dangling bonds can cause much instability of silicon surface during tip disturbing, which results {{in the formation of}} more amorphous silicon and high hillock during the friction process. The results will shed new light on nanofabrication of monocrystalline silicon.|$|E
30|$|To {{study the}} effect of crystal plane {{orientation}} on the hillock formation on silicon, the fabrication was performed on three silicon samples by AFM with a vacuum chamber under a constant load (Fn) of 50 μN both in air and in vacuum (< 5.0 × 10 − 6 Torr). A diamond tip (Micro Star Technologies, TX, USA) with R = 500 nm was used. The normal spring constant (k) of the cantilever of the AFM diamond tip was calibrated as 194 N/m through a calibration cantilever (CLFC-NOBO, Veeco Instruments Inc., NY, USA) [13]. The line-shaped hillocks were produced at the sliding velocity of 40 μm/s. The number of scratch cycles (N) was 100 or 200. To study {{the effect of}} <b>pressed</b> <b>volume</b> on the hillock formation, a sharp diamond tip (R = 250 nm) was employed to perform the fabrication test on Si(100) surface in air. The topography of the scratches produced by the NST and the hillocks by the AFM was observed using the silicon nitride tips (MLCT, Veeco Instruments Inc.) with R = 20 nm and k = 0.1 N/m. During the entire experimental process, the temperature was set to 25 ± 2 °C, and the relative humidity was between 50 % and 55 %.|$|E
