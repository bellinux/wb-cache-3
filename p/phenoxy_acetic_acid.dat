"December 2011 "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The N-Acylation of a sulfoximine with carboxylic acids was accomplished with boric acid and several boronic acids. Aliphatic acids give fair yields of products while acids related to phenylacetic and <b>phenoxy</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acids</b> perform much better. Aromatic acids are ineffective in this process. The formation of an interesting benzothiazine from the reaction of S-o-halophenyl-S-methyl sulfoximines in the presence of copper salts is reported. The product's structure was confirmed by spectroscopic and single-crystal X-ray crystal analysis. The benzothiazine shows fluorescent properties. O-Halo sulfoximines show lower reactivity in Buchwald Hartwig coupling reactions than sulfoximines. One pot procedure to obtain o-halo benzothiazines in decent yields is developed. Some derivatives of 2 -hydroxy cyclopentenone esters have been synthesized and their reactivity in Diels-Alder reaction has been evaluated. It is found that the derivative containing phosphate ester leaving group gives better yields in Diels-Alder reaction among the derivatives. The yields of the DA adducts were lower due to the rapid decomposition of the reactive intermediate cyclopentadienone. The effect of Lithium ion concentration in the intramolecular stereoselective Michael reaction of a sulfoximine with α, β unsaturated esters is studied. With the use of complexating agents such as HMPA, only one isomer is produced.

40|$|Duggan and Pitts (1950) {{claim that}} in the dog mercurial diuretics in maxi-mally tolerated doses and under high saline loads {{depressed}} tubular reabsorption of sodium by about 1. 5 to 1. 7 milliequivalents of sodium per minute. This de-pression of sodium reabsorption is about 21 per cent of the sodium filtered. Since this value corresponded to the postulated facultative reabsorption occur-ring in the distal tubular apparatus (Wesson, Anslow and Smith, 1948), Duggan and Pitts {{have suggested that the}} site of action of mercurial diuretics was in the cells of the distal renal tubule. Mudge, Foulks and Gilman (1949), on the other hand, working under somewhat different experimental conditions, have found in a limited number of experiments depression of sodium reabsorption equal to 25 to 28 per cent of the sodium filtered. They suggested an action of mer-curial diuretics on the proximal tubular mechanism. In the present study we have investigated the influence of dosage of mercury and saline load on the renal action of mercurial diuretics. METHODS: The mercurials employed were mersalyl 3 (2 -[(2 -hydroxy-mercuri- 3 -methoxy-propyl) carbamyl] <b>phenoxy</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid)</b> and Esidron Acid 4 (2 -[2 -hydroxy-mercuri- 3 -hy-droxy-propyl-carbamyl] nicotinic acid). Both compounds were given with cysteine (1 : 1 molar ratio) since, in many instances, cardio-toxic quantities of these mercurials had to be injected. Cysteine protects the heart but does not interfere with the diuretic effects of these mercurials (Farah and Iaresh, 1948) ...|$|E

Compound 1 was treated with various substituted aromatic aldehydes which results in 4 -(substituted benzylideneamino) - 5 -(substituted phenoxymethyl) - 2 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazol- 3 (4 H) -thiones (2 a–g), further 2 a–g is converted to 2 -[4 -(substituted benzylideneamino) - 5 -(substituted phenoxymethyl) - 4 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazol- 3 -yl thio] acetic acid (3 a–l) derivatives by the reaction with chloroacetic acid. All the newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for in vivo anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. Among the series 2 -[4 -(2, 4 -dichlorobenzylideneamino) - 5 -(phenoxymethyl) - 4 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazol- 3 -yl thio] acetic acid (3 d), 2 -[4 -(4 -dichlorobenzylideneamino) - 5 -(phenoxymethyl) - 4 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazol- 3 -yl thio] acetic acid (3 e), 2 -[4 -(2, 4 -dichlorobenzylideneamino) - 5 -[(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) methyl]- 4 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazol- 3 -yl thio] acetic acid (3 j) and 2 -[5 -[(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) methyl) ]- 4 -(4 -chlorobenzylideneamino) - 4 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazol- 3 -yl thio] acetic acid (3 k) showed significant anti-inflammatory activity with P< 0. 001 (63. 4 %, 62. 0 %, 64. 1 % and 62. 5 % edema inhibition, respectively), {{as compared to the}} standard drug diclofenac (67. 0 %) after third hour respectively and also compounds 3 j, 3 k exhibited significant analgesic activity with P< 0. 001 (55. 9 % and 54. 9 % protection, respectively) and less ulcerogenic activity as compared with standard drug aspirin (57. 8 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The present {{investigation}} {{relates to the}} study of In vitro regeneration of Solanum melongena (Thengaithittu variety), which is an agronomically important crop grown primarily for its large oval fruit and its medicinal property. The embryo from mature seeds, cotyledon and shoot explants were inoculated on MS medium supplemented with various concentrations and combinations of 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid, Kinetin, 2, 4 -dichloro <b>phenoxy</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> Thidiazuron and Benzyl amino purine. Cotyledon cultures were highly responsive for callus production on medium supplemented with NAA (10. 6 mg/l) alone. However embryo explants cultures showed good responses for callus production and embryogenesis on MS medium supplemented with NAA (8. 0 mg/l) and Kinetin (0. 1 mg/l). Callusing response for shoot culture was low. In the presence of NAA, the embryo and cotyledon cultures showed callusing response of 40 % and 80 % respectively. Callusing response for embryos was comparatively better on 2 - 4 D containing media (45 %). Cotyledon explants responded in a similar manner in the presence of 2 - 4 D and NAA (75 %). The embryo development occurred in the same medium that contained NAA (8. 0 mg/l) and Kinetin (0. 1 mg/l) in two months and a total of 85 embryos were developed. In callus cultures derived from cotyledon explants, a total of 65 embryos were developed in the presence of high concentration of NAA (10. 6 mg/l) alone. All these embryos derived from cotyledon, embryo and shoot explants were transferred to hormone free medium for germination. After 3 - 4 weeks the regenerated plantlets were transferred to green house. Key words: Solanum melongena 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid Callus Embryogenesis Regenerated plantlet...|$|E
