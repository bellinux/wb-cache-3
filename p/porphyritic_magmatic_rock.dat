In a transect in east-central Turkey extending from Baskil (Elazig) to Divrigi (Sivas) to the north, and from Copler (Erzincan) to Horozkoy (Nigde) to the SW, these <b>magmatic</b> <b>rocks</b> vary in time, spatial distribution, and composition. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages supplemented by a few U–Pb ages geochronology from major plutons demonstrate a general younging of magmatism in the transect from c. 83 Ma in the south (Baskil) to c. 69 Ma in the north (Divrigi-Keban), followed by a c. 44 Ma scattered magmatic complex now found along a NE trending arcuate belt between Copler and Horoz. In general, trace element and rare earth element (REE) geochemistry in the <b>magmatic</b> <b>rocks</b> suggest two main sources for the melts: (1) a mantle-wedge and subducted oceanic lithosphere producing arc-type magma; and (2) meta-somatized lithospheric mantle modified by subduction producing <b>magmatic</b> <b>rocks</b> with more metasomatized mantle and within plate signatures.

40|$|The Late Cretaceous Gogher-Baft {{ophiolite}} {{is one of}} {{the best}} preserved remnants of Neo-Tethyan oceanic lithospheric within the inner Zagros ophiolite belt. The ophiolite comprises from bottom to top, harzburgites, pegmatite and isotropic gabbroic lenses within the mantle sequence, pillowed to massive basalts to dacites and pyroclastic rocks associated with blocks of pelagic limestone and radiolarite. Basaltic to dacitic sills crosscut the pyroclastic rocks. The ophiolite sequence is overlain by Turonian-Maastrichtian pelagic limestones (93. 5 - 65. 5 Ma). Mineral compositions of harzburgites are similar to those of fore-arc peridotites and overlap with abyssal peridotites. Most Gogher-Baft ophiolite <b>magmatic</b> <b>rocks</b> show supra-subduction zone affinities, except for some E-MORB type lavas. The geochemical characteristics suggest that Gogher-Baft ophiolite <b>magmatic</b> <b>rocks</b> were generated during subduction initiation. These show progressive source depletion leading to the formation of MORB to boninitic magmas. Early E-MORB-type pillow lavas may have originated by melting mantle that was not affected by subduction components as the Tethyan oceanic plate began to sink beneath Eurasia as subduction began in the Late Cretaceous. Initial εNd (t) values range from + 2. 6 to + 9 for Gogher-Baft <b>magmatic</b> <b>rocks.</b> Samples with radiogenic Nd overlap with least radiogenic MORBs and with Oman and other Late Cretaceous Tethyan ophiolitic rocks.

The Messinian basalts, which are also enriched in LILE, exhibit transitional characteristics between calc-alkaline and alkaline basalts.

40|$|The Late Paleozoic tectonic {{evolution}} of the Lhasa terrane remains poorly understood due to the paucity of the Late Paleozoic <b>magmatic</b> <b>rocks</b> exposed at the surface. Detrital zircons in the sedimentary rocks can provide a record of <b>magmatic</b> <b>rocks</b> that have been eroded. Here we report detrital zircon U-Pb ages, trace-element and Hf isotopic data of metasedimentary rocks from the Nyingchi Complex in the eastern Himalayan syntaxis. Detrital zircons from the metasedimentary rocks yield major age populations of 330 – 364 Ma, 490 – 800 Ma, 1000 – 1200 Ma, and 1500 – 1800 Ma. The weighted mean ages of the youngest three detrital zircons indicate Carboniferous (~ 330 Ma) depositional age for their sedimentary protoliths. Provenance analysis indicates that the sedimentary detritus was sourced from the Lhasa terrane itself. The presence of abundant 330 – 364 Ma detrital zircons indicates that the Lhasa terrane was characterized by Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous magmatism. The trace-element compositions of the 330 – 364 Ma detrital zircons indicate that their <b>magmatic</b> host <b>rocks</b> mainly include mafic rocks and granitoids, and minor carbonatite. Some mafic host rocks probably formed in rift-related tectonic setting, and the others formed in arc-related tectonic settings. The granitic host rocks were S-type granites.

The most primitive ELM and LMR rocks ana- lyzed consistently display similar trace element and isotopic signatures suggesting a common origin, most likely an enriched MORB-type mantle. In contrast, major and trace element geochemistry, as well as radiogenic isotope systematics of the whole sets of ELM and LMR samples, indicate strikingly different evolutions between ELM and LMR rocks. The ELM rocks have consistently low Sr/Y, increasing Rb/Sr, and decreasing Eu/Gd with SiO 2, suggesting an evo- lution through plagioclase-dominated fractional crys- tallization at shallow crustal levels (20 km), and most likely at sub-crustal levels (> 40 – 50 km).
