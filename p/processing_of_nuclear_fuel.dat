These models include a new radiolytic gas production model that tracks the number of radiolytic gas bubbles produced during an excursion. Also, an equation of state, which accounts for the production of inertial pressure due to a "lag" in thermal expansion and the creation of radiolytic gas bubbles, has been developed for both models. The multi-region model can account for the spatial distribution of the nuclear energy deposited in the solution and both axial and radial acceleration of the fuel material caused by the production of inertial pressure. Predicted power and pressure pulses have been compared with experimental data from the KEWB, CRAC, and SILENE experiments.

Used electrorefiner salt that contained actinide chlorides and was highly loaded with surrogate fission products was processed into three candidate waste forms. The first waste form, a high-loaded ceramic waste form is a variant to the CWF produced during the treatment of Experimental Breeder Reactor-II used fuel at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). The two other waste forms were developed {{by researchers at the}} Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI). These materials are based on a silica-alumina-phosphate matrix and a zinc/titanium oxide matrix. The proposed waste forms, and the processes to fabricate them, were designed to immobilize spent electrorefiner chloride salts containing alkali, alkaline earth, lanthanide, and halide fission products that accumulate in the salt during the <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> used <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel.</b> This aspect <b>of</b> the I-NERI project was to demonstrate 'hot cell' fabrication and characterization of the proposed waste forms.

40|$|To {{ensure the}} {{peaceful}} intent for production and <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel,</b> verifiable process {{monitoring of the}} fuel production cycle is required. As part of a U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) -EURATOM collaboration {{in the field of}} international nuclear safeguards, the DOE Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) and Directorate General-Energy (DG-ENER) developed and demonstrated a new concept in process monitoring, enabling the use of operator process information by branching a second, authenticated data stream to the Safeguards inspectorate. This information would be complementary to independent safeguards data, improving the understanding of the plant's operation. The concept is called the Enhanced Data Authentication System (EDAS). EDAS transparently captures, authenticates, and encrypts communication data that is transmitted between operator control computers and connected analytical equipment utilized in nuclear processes controls. The intent is to capture information as close to the sensor point as possible to assure the highest possible confidence in the branched data. Data must be collected transparently by the EDAS: Operator processes should not be altered or disrupted by the insertion of the EDAS as a monitoring system for safeguards. EDAS employs public key authentication providing `jointly verifiable' data and private key encryption for confidentiality. Timestamps and data source are also added to the collected data for analysis. The core of the system hardware is in a security enclosure with both active and passive tamper indication. Further, the system has the ability to monitor seals or other security devices in close proximity.

The surprising discovery that microorganisms in the genus Geobacter are capable of forming highly conductive networks of filaments that transfer electrons along their length with organic metallic-like conductivity, rather than traditional molecule to molecule electron exchange, provides an explanation for the ability of Geobacter species to grow in subsurface environments with insoluble Fe(III) oxides as the electron acceptor, and effectively remediate groundwater contaminated with hydrocarbon fuels or uranium and similar contaminants associated with the mining and <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel.</b> A similar organic metallic-like conductivity may be an important mechanism for microorganisms to exchange electrons in syntrophic associations, such as those responsible for the conversion of organic wastes to methane in anaerobic digesters, a proven bioenergy technology.
