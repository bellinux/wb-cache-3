Such events can cause critical and possibly fatal disruption of the electromagnetic systems on spacecraft and on ground based structures such as electric power grids, so there is a clear need to understand the events in their totality as they <b>propogate</b> through space and time. This poses a fascinating eScience challenge since the data is gathered by many observatories and communities that have hitherto not needed to work together. We describe how we are developing an eScience infrastructure to make the discovery and analysis of such complex events possible for the communities of heliophysics.

Vegetatively <b>propogated</b> cultures are virtually immortal, with a potential for unlimited growth. Deleterious mutant genes and gene combinations are expected eventually to accumulate and slow or terminate growth even in normal growing, nonsenescent cultures. Occasional outcrossing can purge the genome of the accumulated defective genes, but {{in the absence of}} genetic recombination, deleterious mutations are expected ultimately to result in death of a serially <b>propogated</b> normal culture. Exceptions are known, however, where the potential for unlimited growth is severely limited and death of a culture occurs dramatically after only a brief period of clonal growth following origin from a single ascospore. These short-lived cultures are said to undergo senescence. Senescent strains have been obtained that originated by mutation in the laboratory, others were recovered from nature. The genetic basis of short-term senescence may be either mendelian (chromosomal) or nonmendelian (mitochondrial).
