50|$|A <b>plantar</b> <b>reflex</b> is {{a normal}} reflex that {{involves}} plantar flexion of the foot, which moves toes away from the shin and curls them down. An abnormal <b>plantar</b> <b>reflex</b> (aka Babinski Sign) occurs when upper motor neuron control over the flexion reflex circuit is interrupted. This results in a dorsiflexion of the foot (foot angles towards the shin, big toe curls up). This also occurs in babies under c. 1 year, because of low myelination of the corticospinal tracts. As these tracts develop to adult form, the flexion-reflex circuit is inhibited by the descending corticospinal inputs, and the normal <b>plantar</b> <b>reflex</b> develops. Also known as the Babinski reflex, this {{is a sign of}} neurological abnormality in adults (e.g., upper motor neuron lesion).|$|E

Initial {{symptoms of}} HACE commonly include confusion, loss of consciousness, fever, ataxia, photophobia, rapid heart beat, lassitude, and an altered mental state. Sufferers generally attempt to cease physical activities, regardless of their necessity for survival. Severe headaches develop and sufferers lose the ability to sit up. Retinal venous dilation occurs in 59% of people with HACE. Rarer symptoms include brisk deep tendon reflexes, retinal hemorrhages, blurred vision, extension <b>plantar</b> <b>reflexes,</b> and ocular paralysis.

40|$|The {{actions of}} sodium 4 -hydroxybutyrate, γ-aminobutyric acid and {{meprobamate}} {{have been studied}} in unanaesthetized animals, in local anaesthetic tests, on isolated organ preparations, on convulsions induced by picrotoxin and strychnine, and on monosynaptic (patellar) and polysynaptic (<b>plantar)</b> <b>reflexes</b> of the spinal cord. Sodium 4 -hydroxybutyrate induced a sleep-like state with three unusual features: the righting reflex was remarkably persistent, respiration was good throughout and recovery was abrupt. γ-Aminobutyric acid was inactive and meprobamate caused flaccid paralysis with loss of the righting reflex. None of the agents affected {{the responses of the}} rat diaphragm either to direct stimulation of the muscle or to indirect stimulation through the phrenic nerve. Only meprobamate reduced the responses of theguinea-pig isolated ileum preparation, showed local anaesthetic action and had an anticonvulsant action. All three compounds were capable, after intravenous or topical application, of blocking <b>plantar</b> <b>reflexes</b> in doses which did not affect the patellar reflex. The spinal animal responded in the same way, to the same dose of sodium 4 -hydroxybutyrate, as the decerebrate preparation. Topical application to the motor cortex had no effect on spinal reflexes. We conclude that sodium 4 -hydroxybutyrate acts preferentially on the internuncial neurones in the spinal cord but differs from meprobamate in its other actions. The similarity between the actions of sodium 4 -hydroxybutyrate and of γ-aminobutyric acid provides furtherevidence in support of the hypothesis that sodium 4 -hydroxybutyrate is involved in the γ-aminobutyric acid metabolic pathways...|$|R

50|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} are cognitive, motor, behavioral, {{and for a}} significant proportion of patients also affective. These changes typically occur over a period of 5-10 years. Signs are typically the same as in other dementias, but mainly include cognitive decline and memory impairment of sufficient severity as to interfere with activities of daily living, sometimes with presence of focal neurologic signs, and evidence of features consistent with cerebrovascular disease on brain imaging (CT or MRI). The neurologic signs localizing to certain areas of the brain that can be observed are hemiparesis, bradykinesia, hyperreflexia, extensor <b>plantar</b> <b>reflexes,</b> ataxia, pseudobulbar palsy, as well as gait and swallowing difficulties.

Further examinations before the surgery due to approach to anemia showed severely decreased serum vitamin B 12 level. The patient’s symptoms improved after treating with intramuscular cobalamin. Being a very commonly seen disorder in the general population, B 12 deficiency should be born in mind as a probable diagnosis in patients with peripheral neuropathy and no clear underlying cause presenting to the ED.
