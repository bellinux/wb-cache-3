25|$|Concrete piles are {{typically}} made with steel reinforcing and <b>prestressing</b> tendons {{to obtain the}} tensile strength required, to survive handling and driving, and to provide sufficient bending resistance.|$|E

40|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} (PSC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} reliable, durable and widely used construction materials, which overcomes the weakness of concrete in tension by the introduction of a <b>prestress</b> force. Smart strands enabling measurement of the <b>prestress</b> force have recently been developed to maintain PSC structures throughout their lifetime. However, the smart strand cannot give a representative indication of the whole <b>prestress</b> force when used in multi-strand systems since each strand sustains a different <b>prestress</b> force. In this paper, the actual distribution of the <b>prestress</b> force in a multi-strand system is examined using elastomagnetic (EM) sensors to develop a method for tracking representative indicators of the <b>prestress</b> force using smart strands...|$|R
40|$|The {{converse}} {{magnetoelectric effect}} of an asymmetric Piezo-fiber/Metglas bilayer laminate composite subjected to mechanical <b>prestress</b> is presented. The mechanical <b>prestress</b> is applied by either dc electric voltage bias or direct mechanical load bias. It is {{found that a}} mechanical <b>prestress</b> strongly influences the converse magnetoelectric coupling response. The optimum dc magnetic field bias shifts with different <b>prestress</b> and compressive stress requires higher dc magnetic field bias. Additionally, an optimum <b>prestress</b> exists to maximize the converse magnetoelectric response under certain dc magnetic field bias ranges. Therefore, in order to integrate magnetoelectric composite into actual structures, a proper <b>prestress</b> needs to be employed to maximize the CME coefficient...|$|R

25|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} {{is a kind}} of {{reinforced concrete}} used for overcoming concrete's natural weakness in tension. It can be applied to beams, floors or bridges with a longer span than is practical with ordinary reinforced concrete. <b>Prestressing</b> tendons (generally of high tensile steel cable or rods) are used to provide a clamping load which produces a compressive stress that offsets the tensile stress that the concrete compression member would, otherwise, experience due to a bending load.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Prestressing</b> {{concrete}} is {{a technique}} that greatly increases the load-bearing strength of concrete beams. The reinforcing steel in the bottom part of the beam, which will be subjected to tensile forces when in service, is placed in tension before the concrete is poured around it. Once the concrete has hardened, the tension on the reinforcing steel is released, placing a built-in compressive force on the concrete. When loads are applied, the reinforcing steel takes on more stress and the compressive force in the concrete is reduced, but does not become a tensile force. [...] Since the concrete is always under compression, it is less subject to cracking and failure.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} a common {{practice}} both in Sweden and worldwide to enclose nuclear reactors with prestressed concrete structures. The <b>prestress</b> level decreases with time from its initial value due to various degradation mechanisms. To ensure that the <b>prestress</b> level is sufficient the tendon force is measured at regular in-service inspections. The intention with {{this paper is to}} present a reliability-based procedure to evaluate the <b>prestress</b> level on the basis of data from in-service inspections. Existing approaches to evaluate the <b>prestress</b> level do {{not take into account the}} variability in the measured <b>prestress.</b> It is not possible to achieve a complete assurance concerning the <b>prestress</b> level. However, by using a probabilistic model, involving the variability in the measuring result and the structural behaviour, the <b>prestress</b> level could be confirmed in a more stringent way. Both the time dependent loss of <b>prestress</b> and the possibility of tendons being broken (due to defects as corrosion) are considered. To avoid through-wall cracks in the concrete it is required that the <b>prestress</b> shall counterbalances the tensile stresses expected at an internal accident. The factor of interest is the <b>prestress</b> level in the concrete and not the force in individual tendons. Several tendons influence the <b>prestress</b> level in a specific part of the containment. The required <b>prestress</b> level shall be fulfilled in all parts of the containment where each part is influenced by a number of individual tendons. It is suggested in this paper that this problem can be analysed as a structural reliability problem idealized as a series of correlated parallel subsystems. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Screwed {{acetabular}} cups, {{applied in}} total hip replacements, generate stresses {{in the surrounding}} bone during implantation (<b>prestresses).</b> The effect of these <b>prestresses</b> on the endurance of the hip replacement are unknown. The <b>prestresses</b> in the acetabulum were examined both experimentally, using strain gauge techniques, and numerically, using the finite element method. It {{was found that the}} <b>prestresses</b> were of the same order of magnitude, if not larger, than the stresses due to the hip reaction force during one-legged stance. In some cases, the <b>prestresses</b> even approximated the ultimate tensile strength of cortical bone. The <b>prestresses</b> seemed to have a strong dependence on the outer shape of the cup, rather than on the flexibility of the cup or whether the cup had a self-cutting thread or not. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} <b>prestresses</b> are not very susceptible to stress relaxation due to the visco-elastic behaviour of bone. This means that <b>prestresses</b> will remain present over long periods of time. So even when a patient has resumed normal daily activities, the <b>prestresses</b> will still play an important role in the overall stress distributions around the acetabulum. Due to the interaction of <b>prestresses</b> and stresses due to normal loading, the primary stability of a metal-backed screwed cup is better guaranteed than the primary stability of an all-polyethylene screwed cup...|$|R
30|$|The <b>prestress</b> {{force at}} jacking per tendon was 4, 328  kN. The {{effective}} <b>prestress</b> was obtained using AASHTO LRFD procedure [24]. The total loss of <b>prestress</b> was determined as {{the sum of}} the short-term losses (elastic shortening of 20  MPa, friction loss of 54  MPa, anchorage set loss of 76  MPa) and long-term losses (shrinkage/creep, steel relaxation) of 249  MPa, resulting in a total loss of 399  MPa. The approximate method given by AASHTO LRFD, article 5.9. 5.3, was used herein to find the long-term losses, with an assumed relative humidity of 70 %. The resulting effective <b>prestress</b> was 1, 144  MPa. A total <b>prestress</b> loss of 399  MPa was obtained, resulting in the net long-term <b>prestress</b> force of 4, 328  kN per tendon.|$|R
2500|$|Magnetostrictive {{transducers}} were pursued after WW2 as {{an alternative}} to piezoelectric ones. Nickel scroll-wound ring transducers were used for high-power low-frequency operations, with size up to [...] in diameter, probably the largest individual sonar transducers ever. The advantage of metals is their high tensile strength and low input electrical impedance, but they have electrical losses and lower coupling coefficient than PZT, whose tensile strength can be increased by <b>prestressing.</b> Other materials were also tried; nonmetallic ferrites were promising for their low electrical conductivity resulting in low eddy current losses, Metglas offered high coupling coefficient, but they were inferior to PZT overall. In the 1970s, compounds of rare earths and iron were discovered with superior magnetomechanic properties, namely the Terfenol-D alloy. This made possible new designs, e.g. a hybrid magnetostrictive-piezoelectric transducer. The most recent sch material is Galfenol.|$|E

40|$|Structures {{that have}} a reserve {{capacity}} beyond buckling can generally be stiffened against buckling {{through the use of}} <b>prestress.</b> The design of <b>prestress</b> for such cases is treated in a way which leads to the maximization of the buckling load for a prescribed available <b>prestress</b> strain energy. The formulation given for this optimal design problem relates closely to the energy principles of structural analysis. Optimal <b>prestress</b> configurations are determined for the circular plate, and for a second example structure {{in the form of a}} stut-membrane system. Developments from the study of <b>prestress</b> design are related to past results from postbuckling analysis...|$|R
30|$|The {{amount of}} thermal <b>prestress</b> loss depends {{directly}} upon the bond stress–slip relationships during the steam curing process. Although {{it seems to}} be necessary priori knowledge to understand the bond stress–slip relationships of a strand in concrete at elevated temperature, no research has been reported in the literature. Absent such knowledge, inconsistent bonding time has been assumed for the purpose of estimating thermal <b>prestress</b> loss in the literature. Barr et al. (2005) estimated the thermal <b>prestress</b> loss of 3 – 7 % of the initial <b>prestress</b> if bonding occurred within the range of 6 – 10  h after casting. Roller et al. (2003) suggested that thermal <b>prestress</b> loss prior to release was 6 % if bonding occurred within 6  h after casting. Erkmen et al. (2008) assumed that thermal <b>prestress</b> loss occurred until the concrete reached its maximum temperature. To validate the theoretical estimation of thermal <b>prestress</b> loss, the occurrence of bonding in different steam curing regimes must be investigated.|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} developed smart strand {{can be used}} to measure the <b>prestress</b> force in the prestressed concrete (PSC) structure from the construction stage to the in-service stage. The higher cost of the smart strand compared to the conventional strand renders it unaffordable to replace all the strands by smart strands, and results in the application of {{only a limited number of}} smart strands in the PSC structure. However, the <b>prestress</b> forces developed in the strands of the multi-strand system frequently adopted in PSC structures differ from each other, which means that the <b>prestress</b> force in the multi-strand system cannot be obtained by simple proportional scaling using the measurement of the smart strand. Therefore, this study examines the <b>prestress</b> force distribution in the multi-strand system to find the correlation between the <b>prestress</b> force measured by the smart strand and the <b>prestress</b> force distribution in the multi-strand system. To that goal, the <b>prestress</b> force distribution was measured using electromagnetic sensors for various factors of the multi-strand system adopted on site in the fabrication of actual PSC girders. The results verified the possibility to assume normal distribution for the <b>prestress</b> force distribution per anchor head, and a method computing the mean and standard deviation defining the normal distribution is proposed. This paper presents a meaningful finding by proposing an estimation method of the <b>prestress</b> force based upon field-measured data of the <b>prestress</b> force distribution in the multi-strand system of actual PSC structures...|$|R
50|$|The {{durability}} of prestressed concrete is principally {{determined by the}} level of corrosion protection provided to any high-strength steel elements within the <b>prestressing</b> tendons. Also critical is the protection afforded to the end-anchorage assemblies of unbonded tendons or cable-stay systems, as the anchorages of both of these are required to retain the <b>prestressing</b> forces permanently. Failure {{of any of these}} components can result in the release of <b>prestressing</b> forces, or the physical rupture of stressing tendons.|$|E

Alumina tile confined with aluminum alloy, which {{was in a state of}} triaxial compression, was chosen as the target in impact tests to investigate the impact resistance of prestressed ceramics. The results from two types of impact tests indicate that both impact resistance and armor-piercing resistance are greatly enhanced due to the presence of <b>prestress</b> and compact confinements, and that triaxial <b>prestress</b> is much better than biaxial <b>prestress</b> for enhancing the impact resistance of ceramics...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of magnetostrictive Terfenol-D is {{highly dependent on}} the state of the material and in particular on the mechanical <b>prestress.</b> This paper presents an experimental investigation of the effect of <b>prestress</b> on the dynamic {{performance of}} a Terfenol-D transducer. The effects of both <b>prestress</b> and magnetic bias on the near DC transducer performance are also presented. Experimental results demonstrate the sensitivity of the transducer performance in terms of strain, strain rate with applied field, and material properties to relatively small changes in initial mechanical <b>prestress.</b> Trends in material properties, Young’s Modulus, magnetomechanical coupling factor, permeability, dynamic strain coefficient, and mechanical quality factor with <b>prestress</b> and drive level are developed. In addition, the effect of magnetic bias and frequency of operation on the strain at different applied fields are examined and shown to significantly influence transducer output at a given <b>prestress</b> level. For the transducer as operated in this study, including the appropriate magnetic bias, both the magnetomechancial coupling and the strain coefficient are optimized with a <b>prestress</b> of 1. 0 to 1. 25 ksi...|$|R
40|$|A <b>prestress</b> force {{identification}} method for externally prestressed concrete uniform beam {{based on the}} frequency equation and the measured frequencies is developed. For {{the purpose of the}} <b>prestress</b> force identification accuracy, we first look for the appropriate method to solve the free vibration equation of externally prestressed concrete beam and then combine the measured frequencies with frequency equation to identify the <b>prestress</b> force. To obtain the exact solution of the free vibration equation of multispan externally prestressed concrete beam, an analytical model of externally prestressed concrete beam is set up based on the Bernoulli-Euler beam theory and the function relation between <b>prestress</b> variation and vibration displacement is built. The multispan externally prestressed concrete beam is taken as the multiple single-span beams which must meet the bending moment and rotation angle boundary conditions, the free vibration equation is solved using sublevel simultaneous method and the semi-analytical solution of the free vibration equation which considered the influence of <b>prestress</b> on section rigidity and beam length is obtained. Taking simply supported concrete beam and two-span concrete beam with external tendons as examples, frequency function curves are obtained with the measured frequencies into it and the <b>prestress</b> force can be identified using the abscissa of the crosspoint of frequency functions. Identification value of the <b>prestress</b> force is in good agreement with the test results.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in Abrasive Waterjet (AWJ) technology {{have resulted in}} a new process for surface treatment that is capable of introducing compressive residual stresses and a surface texture that facilitates bonding. The current research focuses on quantifying the influences of Abrasive Waterjet Peening (AWJP) with elastic <b>prestress</b> on the surface and subsurface residual stress distributions and surface texture of three engineering metals (ASTM 228, Ti 6 Al 4 V and inconel 718). A design of experiments (DOE) and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to identify the treatment parameters with primary contributions to the residual stress field. The applied elastic <b>prestress</b> ranged from 0 to 75 % of the target yield strength. Surface residual stress resulting from AWJP was compressive and ranged from 500 to 2500 MPa, and the depth of compressive residual stress ranged from nearly 80 to 600 mm. While the elastic <b>prestress</b> had no effect on the surface texture, it was a primary contributor to the magnitude of surface residual stress, which increased with an increase in the elastic <b>prestress.</b> The boundary conditions used to apply the <b>prestress</b> were found to be important to the residual stress field. Load control flexure <b>prestress</b> resulted in larger surface and subsurface compressive residual stress when compared to the displacement control flexure <b>prestress.</b> A finite element analysis of the treatment was used to explore the potential for using alternate <b>prestress</b> configurations to improve the residual stress distributions and to develop an understanding of the treatment mechanics. Three different <b>prestress</b> conditions (flexure, axial and biaxial loading) were simulated on a Ti 6 Al 4 V target subjected to a single impact. Each condition was studied under both load and displacement control boundary conditions. The finite element evaluations identified two mechanisms (plasticization and superposition) that contributed to the increase in magnitude and changes in shape of the residual stress field in treatments with elastic <b>prestress.</b> Overall, application of elastic <b>prestress</b> resulted in a 100 % and 40 % increase in the compressive surface residual stress and maximum residual stress and a 25 % increase in the depth of compressive residual stress. The responses were influenced by the <b>prestress</b> distribution and in all cases load control <b>prestress</b> had a larger influence when compared to the displacement control. Results of the finite element model indicated that a biaxial <b>prestress</b> incorporating a combination of compressive and tensile components could be used to further improve the residual stress characteristics resulting from particle-based surface treatments. According to the results of this study, AWJP with elastic <b>prestress</b> can serve as a viable method of surface treatment in situations that require an increase in surface roughness and a compressive residual stress. The current study has showed that elastic <b>prestress</b> {{could be used as a}} design variable to achieve a desired subsurface residual stress distribution in particle-based surface treatments...|$|R
