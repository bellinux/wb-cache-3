40|$|The Motorola MC 68 HC 11 {{microcontroller}} {{is one of}} {{the semiconductor}} achievements that offers various facilities in microprocessor control applications with no need for excessive external support in hardwares. This new product provides the flexibility, efficiency, economy, and simplicity for the designing job of the microprocessor control applications. This study was conducted to improve the current microprocessor teaching materials which are mostly out-of-date and expensive in conducting lab experiments, and to determine the relative effectiveness of the new microprocessor teaching materials. A set of seven explanatory lab experiments were designed and developed on the Motorola MC 68 HC 11 microcontroller EVB (Evaluation Board), and students 2 ̆ 7 learning achievement tests on implementing these set of experiments have been used to determine the effectiveness of the design as well as applications of the microcontroller;Seven explanatory lab experiments were developed and designed according to the current literature reviews of microcontroller and several Industrial Technology microprocessor courses guidelines. The first four of these seven experiments were chosen as samples of students 2 ̆ 7 design projects;A pretest and posttest with matching statistical model was used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the explanatory experiments in students learning achievements. The pretest and posttest scores were used in several statistical analyses to compute the significant difference between the two groups. The average days in completing a project were used to compute the differences between the two groups;Results from analyses of the data did not reject the first hypothesis H[subscript] 01 : 2 ̆ 2 There is no significant learning achievement difference between the experimental group students who used the Motorola 68 HC 11 microcontroller EVB and the control group students who used the traditional microprocessor as their project design tool, 2 ̆ 2 and rejected the second hypothesis H[subscript] 02 : 2 ̆ 2 There is no significant difference in time required to complete the assigned projects between the two groups. 2 ̆ 2;Recommendations for further studies are investigating larger samples from different colleges and universities, designing microcontroller applications at different course levels, applying the microcontroller features to robotics <b>controls,</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>or</b> <b>hydraulic</b> servo <b>control,</b> and investigating other higher level microcontrollers applications...|$|R

These bearings have gliding pads that are pressed via pressure elements against the gliding disk {{to stabilize the}} nacelle against undesirable movement. The pressure elements can be simple steel springs, <b>pneumatic,</b> <b>or</b> <b>hydraulic</b> pre-tension elements, etc. The use of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>or</b> <b>hydraulic</b> pre-tension elements allows active control of the yaw bearing pre-tension, which provides yaw brake function.|$|R

50|$|The {{simplest}} actuator {{is purely}} mechanical, where linear motion {{in one direction}} gives rise to rotation. The most common actuators though are electrically powered.

50|$|Manually {{operated}} valves {{work with}} simple levers or paddles where the operator applies force {{to operate the}} valve. Spring force is sometimes used to recover the position of valve.

50|$|On smaller autoclaves, {{rotation}} of the locking ring is sometimes accomplished by manually operated geared devices. On larger ones, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>or</b> <b>hydraulic</b> cylinders are used.

5000|$|Originally the {{gas flow}} {{computer}} was a mechanical (1920s technology) <b>or</b> later a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>or</b> <b>hydraulic</b> computing module (1940s technology {{used to the}} early 1990s but still available {{from a number of}} suppliers), subsequently superseded in most applications by an electronic module, as the primary elements switched from transmitting the measured variables from <b>pneumatic</b> <b>or</b> <b>hydraulic</b> pressure signals to electric current as explosion-proof (1960s technology to present)) and then intrinsically safe (1970s to present) transmitters (with low-power transistor circuitry) became available, that simply provided a dedicated gas flow computer function. Today [...] "gas flow computers" [...] as such have become uncommon, since gas flow computing is a subfunction of a data acquisition and control program implemented with programmable logic controller (PLCs) and remote terminal unit (RTUs); with the rise of smart transmitters in the early 1980s, these functions have also been incorporated within the field transmitters themselves.|$|R
50|$|An {{actuator}} {{requires a}} control signal {{and a source}} of energy. The control signal is relatively low energy and may be electric voltage <b>or</b> current, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>or</b> <b>hydraulic</b> pressure, <b>or</b> even human power. The supplied main energy source may be electric current, <b>hydraulic</b> fluid pressure, <b>or</b> <b>pneumatic</b> pressure. When the control signal is received, the actuator responds by converting the energy into mechanical motion.|$|R

50|$|Tube Cleaners-tube {{cleaning}} demands {{vary widely}} by applicationShell and tube heat exchangers and chillers: Deposits are typically sediment from impurities {{in the water}} circulating through the tubes. Manual scrubbing with a wire brush attached to a long rod is the traditional method of cleaning.

50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of an {{aircraft}} APU is to provide power to start the main engines. Turbine engines must be accelerated to a high rotational speed to provide sufficient air compression for self-sustaining operation. Smaller jet engines are usually started by an electric motor, while larger engines are usually started by an air turbine motor. Before the engines are to be turned, the APU is started, generally by a battery <b>or</b> <b>hydraulic</b> accumulator. Once the APU is running, it provides power (electric, <b>pneumatic,</b> <b>or</b> <b>hydraulic,</b> depending on the design) to start the aircraft's main engines.|$|R
50|$|A box crib or {{cribbing}} is {{a temporary}} wooden structure used to support heavy objects during construction, relocation, vehicle extrication and urban search and rescue.

Cribbing is often {{used in conjunction with}} other stabilization equipment, such as <b>pneumatic</b> <b>or</b> <b>hydraulic</b> shoring. Cribbing is also used in sub-surface mining as a roof support. Cribbing has largely been replaced by hydraulic shoring in modern mining applications.|$|R

50|$|A honing machine, ironically, is {{relatively}} accurate and perfect. Instead {{of relying on}} {{the accuracy of the}} machine tool, it relies on the averaging effect between the stone and the workpiece. In fact, compliance is a requirement of a honing machine that is necessary for the averaging effect to occur. This leads to an obvious difference between the two machines: in a grinder the stone is rigidly attached to a slide, while in honing the stone is actuated with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>or</b> <b>hydraulic</b> pressure.|$|R
50|$|The A380 was {{initially}} planned without thrust reversers, incorporating sufficient braking {{capacity to do}} without them. However Airbus elected to equip the two inboard engines with thrust reversers in a late stage of development, helping the brakes when the runway is slippery. The two outboard engines do not have reversers, {{reducing the amount of}} debris stirred up during landing. The A380 has electrically actuated thrust reversers, giving them better reliability than their <b>pneumatic</b> <b>or</b> <b>hydraulic</b> equivalents, in addition to saving weight.|$|R

50|$|A {{mechanism}} is provided {{to move the}} points from one position to the other (change the points).

50|$|The basic {{pressure}} washer {{consists of a}} motor (either electric, internal combustion, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>or</b> <b>hydraulic)</b> that drives a high-pressure water pump, a high-pressure hose and a trigger gun-style switch. Just as a garden hose nozzle is used to increase the velocity of water, a {{pressure washer}} creates high pressure and velocity. The pump cannot draw more water from the pipe to which the washer is connected than that source can provide: the water supply must be adequate for the machine connected to it, as water starvation leads to cavitation damage of the pump elements.|$|R
