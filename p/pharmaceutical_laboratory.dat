By the end of the war, Indiana had become less rural that it previously had been. Overall, the war caused Indiana's industries to grow exponentially, although the state's southern counties experienced growth after the war at a slower rate than its other counties. The state's population shifted to central and northern Indiana as new industries and cities began to develop around the Great Lakes and the railroad depots erected during the war.

Indianapolis was also the wartime home of Richard Gatling, inventor of the Gatling Gun, one of the world's first machine guns. Although his invention was used in some Civil War-era campaigns, it was not fully adopted for use by the U.S. Army until 1866. Charles Conn, another war veteran, founded C. G. Conn Ltd. in Elkhart, Indiana, where the manufacturing of musical instruments became a new industry for the town.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The public {{production}} of medicines in Brazil by Government <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>Laboratories</b> {{has once again}} become the object of incentives, and Industrial Development Partnerships {{are one of the}} mechanisms adopted for the {{production of}} strategic medicines for the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS). Considering that burden-of-disease studies have been used as a tool to define priority and essential medicines, the article compares the product portfolios of the country’s Official <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>Laboratories</b> (OPL) and the list of strategic medicines for the SUS and burden of disease in Brazil in 2008. Of the 205 strategic medicines for the SUS and 111 from the portfolios, 73 % and 89 %, respectively, are on the National List of Essential Medicines (RENAME 2014). Some strategic medicines for the SUS are already produced by OPL and feature the selection of cancer drugs and biologicals. The current study contributes to the discussion on the public production of medicines in light of the country’s current industrial policy and highlights the need to define priority drugs and the role of OPL in guaranteeing access to them...|$|R
