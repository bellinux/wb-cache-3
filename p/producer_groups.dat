25|$|Africa's exports {{come from}} the places such as South Africa, Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. These exports are valued at $24 million USD. Between the years of 2004 and 2006 Africa quickly {{expanded}} their number of FLO certified <b>producer</b> <b>groups,</b> rising from 78 to 171; nearly half of which reside in Kenya, following closely behind are Tanzania and South Africa.

Cocoa-producing countries in West Africa often form cooperatives that produce fair trade cocoa such as Kuapa Kokoo in Ghana. West African countries without strong fair trade industries are subject to deterioration in cocoa quality as they compete with other countries for a profit. These countries include Cameroon, Nigeria, and the Ivory Coast.|$|E
