5|$|In {{the ensuing}} months of winter {{darkness}} Joyce and Wild printed around 30copies of the expedition's book, Aurora Australis, which were sewn and bound using <b>packaging</b> <b>materials.</b> The most important winter's work, however, {{was preparing for}} the following season's major journeys, which were to include attempts on both the South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. By making his base in McMurdo Sound, Shackleton {{had been able to}} reinstate the Magnetic Pole as an expedition objective. Shackleton himself would be leading the South Pole journey, which had suffered a serious setback during the winter when four of the remaining ponies died, mainly from eating volcanic sand for its salt content.|$|E
5|$|Prior to deindustrialisation in the late-20th century, Milnrow's {{economy was}} linked closely with a {{spinning}} and weaving tradition which had evolved from developments in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. Industries ancillary to textile production were also operational, such as coal mining at Tunshill, and metalworking at Butterworth Hall. Butterworth Hall Colliery {{was the largest}} colliery in the Rochdale region, employing around 300 men in 1912. Modern sectors in the area include engineering, <b>packaging</b> <b>materials,</b> the dyeing and finishing of textiles and carpets, and ink production. The main street comprises a variety of shops, restaurants and food outlets.|$|E

25|$|In 1955, {{after the}} {{adoption}} of the first post-war slum clearance plan, new housing estates were built to replace the slums and, gradually, redundant textile mills were occupied by firms in the various light industries. New applications of engineering principles, the manufacture of rubber goods, plastics, chemicals and <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> were all introduced, as well as the addition of synthetic fibres to the textile trade, reducing unemployment.|$|E
25|$|Although {{public concern}} about fallout from nuclear testing {{grew in the}} early 1950s, fallout was {{discovered}} after the Trinity test in 1945. Photographic film manufacturers would later report 'fogged' films; this was traced to <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> sourced from Indiana crops, contaminated by the Trinity and later tests at the Nevada Test Site, over 1,000 miles away. Intense fallout from the 1953 Simon test was documented as far as Albany, New York.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{each new}} food is {{approved}} separately with a guideline specifying a maximum dosage; {{in case of}} quarantine applications the minimum dose is regulated. <b>Packaging</b> <b>materials</b> containing the food processed by irradiation must also undergo approval.

25|$|As {{an example}} of how {{resource}} recycling can be beneficial, many of the items thrown away contain precious metals which can be recycled to create a profit, such as the components in circuit boards. Other industries can also benefit from resource recycling with the wood chippings in pallets and other <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> being passed onto sectors such as the horticultural profession. In this instance, workers can use the recycled chips to create paths, walkways, or arena surfaces.|$|E

These could be partially replaced by bioplastics, which are derived from renewable plant feedstocks such as vegetable oil, cornstarch, pea starch, or microbiota. They are used either as a direct replacement for traditional plastics or as blends with traditional plastics. The most common end use market is for <b>packaging</b> <b>materials.</b> Japan has also been a pioneer in bioplastics, incorporating them into electronics and automobiles.|$|E

25|$|While {{hydrophobic}} polymers beneficially repel {{water and}} contribute to chewiness, they also detrimentally attract oil. The stickiness of gum results from this hydrophobic nature, as gum can form bonds and stick when it makes contact with oily surfaces such as sidewalks, skin, hair, or the sole of one’s shoe. To make matters worse, unsticking the gum is a challenge because the long polymers of the gum base stretch, rather than break. The sticky characteristic of gum may be problematic during processing if the gum sticks to any machinery or <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> during processing, impeding the flow of product. Aside from ensuring that the machinery is free from lipid-based residues, this issue can be combatted by the conditioning and coating of gum {{toward the end of}} the process. By adding either a powder or a coating to the exterior of the gum product, the hydrophobic gum base binds to the added substance instead of various surfaces with which it may come in contact.|$|E
25|$|In Hong Kong and Macau, the {{day after}} the Mid-Autumn Festival is a public holiday rather than the festival date itself (unless that date falls on a Sunday, then Monday is also a holiday), because many celebration events are held at night. There are a number of festive {{activities}} such as lighting lanterns, but mooncakes are the most important feature there. However, people don't usually buy mooncakes for themselves, but to give their relatives as presents. People start to exchange these presents well in advance of the festival. Hence, mooncakes are sold in elegant boxes for presentation purpose. Also, the price for these boxes are not considered cheap—a four-mooncake box of the lotus seeds paste with egg yolks variety, can generally cost US$40 or more. However, as environmental protection has become a concern of the public in recent years, many mooncake manufacturers in Hong Kong have adopted practices to reduce <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> to practical limits. The mooncake manufacturers also explore in the creation of new types of mooncakes, such as ice-cream mooncake and snow skin mooncake.|$|E
