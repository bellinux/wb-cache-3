40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} characterise the fissure field {{provoked}} by the Super-Sauze mudslide (South French Alps) {{in the surface}} material, we conducted a seismic survey and compared the resulting P-wave tomogram to surface observations and cone <b>penetrometer</b> <b>tests.</b> The first {{results show that the}} distribution of the P-wave velocities correlates well with the fissure parameters, i. e. density, depth, and thickness, estimated from digital photographs and field observations.

The results of our study demonstrate that seismic azimuth tomography is efficient for characterising fissure systems with the main advantage of the method lying in the integration capacity of wave propagation compared to local mechanical tests.

50|$|The Fall cone test, {{also called}} the cone <b>penetrometer</b> <b>test</b> is an {{alternate}} to the Casagrande method for measuring the Liquid Limit of a soil sample. It is often preferred to the Casagrande method {{because it is more}} repeatable and less variable with different operators. In the test, a soil sample is placed in a 55 mm diameter, 40 mm deep metal cup. A stainless steel cone weighing 80 g (including the shaft) and having a 30Â° angle is positioned so that its tip just touches the sample. The cone is released for 5 seconds so that it may penetrate the soil. The liquid limit is defined as the water content of the soil which allows the cone to penetrate exactly 20 mm during that period of time. Because it is difficult to obtain a test with exactly 20 mm penetration, the procedure is performed multiple times with a range of water contents and the results are interpolated.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} {{the utility of}} full flow penetrometers such as theT-bar and Ball penetrometers as characterisation tools for peat. Penetration tests were conducted at three peat sites together with in-situ vane tests {{and a number of}} laboratory triaxial tests. The T-bar and Ball are shown to yield a narrower range of N factors relating penetration resistances to undrained shear strength than the Nkt factor of the CPTU. The T-bar and Ball are found to overcome many of the difficulties associated with the CPTU in soft peat. In disagreement with analytical solutions, T-bar resistances tended to be higher than comparative tests using the Ball. It is suggested that {{this is due to the}} structural anisotropy of peat and is a feature of other soils where this phenomenon is observed. N factors based on excess pore water pressures for the CPTU (Nu) and Ball (NuBall) seem to be less scattered than those based on penetration resistances.
