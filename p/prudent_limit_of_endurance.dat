5000|$|On {{the morning}} of 7 May, [...] — a {{modified}} Type VIIC/41 boat under O/L H Emmerich — was two days into her first operational patrol and running submerged, when she was detected by an RAF Catalina under Flt/Lt KM Murray of 210 Squadron, Coastal Command. Murray attacked immediately with a pattern of depth charges. U-320 was damaged but not destroyed; Murray sighted oil, and sonobuoys dropped by the Catalina detected hammering. Murray was unable to continue the attack and by mid-afternoon, at his <b>Prudent</b> <b>Limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>Endurance</b> (PLE), was forced to abandon the hunt. Emmerich meanwhile headed for Norway, abandoning his crippled boat the following day. Emmerich and all his crew survived. U-320 was the last U-boat to be sunk in action during the Battle of the Atlantic.|$|E

50|$|Tests were {{performed}} on groups of men in a large (100 m3) stainless-steel gas chamber to ascertain effectiveness of various materials and designs of protective clothing, during periods of physical exertion and after being subject to normal wear and tear. Other tests were conducted to determine the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>endurance</b> <b>of</b> soldiers in performing arduous tasks after bodily exposure to mustard gas. Gas masks or respirators were used to minimise inhalation of the gas.|$|R

"The {{extensive}} {{distribution of}} troops has strained {{the soldiers of}} the army to the full <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>endurance.</b> Each little command has had to provide its own service of security and information by never ceasing patrols, explorations, escorts, outposts and regular guards[...] [...] In all things requiring endurance, fortitude and patient diligence, the guerilla period has been pre-eminent." ...|$|R
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{successful}} solar-propelled vehicles have been the [...] "rovers" [...] used to explore surfaces of the Moon and Mars.

5000|$|After {{three days}} of battle, with each night spent on the march or {{occupied}} in the sorting out and reorganization of units, the troops - Germans as well as British - were tired almost to the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>endurance.</b> The physical and mental strain of the struggle against overwhelming odds, the heavy losses, the sinister rumours which were rife, all contributed to depress morale.|$|R
60|$|Accustomed, inured, {{as she was}} to {{the coarse}} profligacy of her dullard husband, and {{indifferent}} to his philandering as her contempt of him now left her, yet in the affront thus publicly offered her, she felt that the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>endurance</b> had been reached.

60|$|The Slavic fox {{was of a}} pallid fairness, he had {{a remarkably}} long nose, a thick, short moustache, and small blue eyes that were a little too near {{together}} to be pleasant. It was his habit to worry his moustache with short, nervous tugs whenever his restless mind troubled him, and now this motion was becoming so incessant that it irked Pestovitch beyond the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>endurance.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Capital {{punishment}} {{was introduced in}} Kenya in 1893 by the colonial government; the practice was uncommon in pre-colonial communities, which placed {{a high value on}} human life. In general, most African communities did not impose a death sentence on an individual unless as a last resort for an offender who had repeatedly [...] "made themselves dangerous beyond the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>endurance</b> <b>of</b> their fellows". The Penal Code as created by the British required a mandatory death penalty for murder, treason and armed robbery. Numerous executions, documented as 1,090 in number, were carried out by the British colonial government during the Mau Mau Uprising.|$|R

60|$|A {{certain amount}} of revenue may, as we have seen, be {{obtained}} without injustice by a peculiar tax on rent. Besides (1) the land-tax,(346) and (2) an equivalent for the revenue derived from stamp duties on the conveyance of land, some further taxation might, I have contended, at some future period be imposed, (3) to enable the state {{to participate in the}} progressive increase of the incomes of landlords from natural causes. (4) Legacies and inheritances, we have also seen, ought to be subjected to taxation sufficient to yield a considerable revenue. With these taxes, and (5) a house-tax of suitable amount, we should, I think, have reached the <b>prudent</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> direct taxation. The remainder of the revenue would have to be provided by taxes on consumption, and the question is, which of these are the least objectionable.|$|R

5000|$|Biebow was a {{ruthless}} administrator, {{concerned with the}} ghetto's productivity and his own personal gain. He was directly responsible for starving the ghetto's population beyond <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>endurance,</b> and he assisted the Gestapo in rounding up Jews during deportations. In the days just before the liberation of Lodz by the Red Army, Biebow ordered large burial pits to be dug in the local cemetery, intending that the Gestapo execute the remaining 877 Jews {{who served as a}} clean-up crew in the ghetto. [...] This might have been an attempt by Biebow to eliminate witnesses to his role in the workings of the Ghetto.|$|R

50|$|Merrill has an {{idiosyncratic}} methodology {{which involves}} never taking breaks during a day’s walk, carrying no water, travelling unaccompanied and walking thirty {{miles a day}} and more at a constant rate of three miles per hour. He {{has suggested that the}} <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>endurance</b> is approximately 200 miles per week. He claims on his website that “you need to walk 500 mi before you are settled into the task and have comfy feet. After 1000 mi you are really adjusted and by 1500 mi you can push yourself relentlessly. By 2000 mi of continuous walking you are at your peak performance, but after 2500 mi you are physically declining”.|$|R

(Feb. 11, 1998)There is a {{place on}} earth where all life is pushed to the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>endurance</b> - a {{landscape}} of stark beauty and brutal extremes where survival is constantly challenged. Southwestern Africa's Etosha is a vast and ancient land of seasonal paradox. During the bloom of the wet season, lions, cheetahs, elephants, jackals, giraffes, springboks and zebras continue the timeless cycle of life in glorious abundance. But {{at the peak of}} its scorching dry season, the heart of Etosha is a parched and blistered wasteland where drought and thirst endanger predator and prey alike. For those who survive its harshest interval, Etosha becomes, once again, a Living Eden.|$|R

5000|$|The novel {{features}} HMS Ulysses, a light cruiser {{that is well}} {{armed and}} among the fastest ships in the world. Her crew is pushed well beyond the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>endurance</b> and the book starts {{in the aftermath of}} a mutiny. Ulysses puts to sea again to escort FR-77, a vital convoy heading for Murmansk. They are beset by numerous challenges: an unusually fierce Arctic storm, German ships and U-boats, as well as air attacks. All slowly reduce the convoy from 32 ships to only five. The Ulysses is sunk in a failed attempt to ram a German cruiser after all her other weapons had been destroyed. This echoes events in which British G-class destroyer [...] and , an armed merchant cruiser, sacrificed themselves by engaging larger opponents.|$|R
60|$|The {{backs of}} the soldiers, determined, unyielding, were covered with heavy brown capes that fell below the waist. As Janet's glance wandered down the line it was arrested by {{the face of a}} man in a visored woollen cap--a face that was almost sepia, in which large white eyeballs struck a note of hatred. And what she seemed to see in it, confronting her, were the hatred and despair of her own soul! The man might have been a Hungarian or a Pole; the breadth of his chin was accentuated by a wide, black moustache, his {{attitude}} was tense,--that of a maddened beast ready to spring at the soldier in front of him. He was plainly one of those who had reached the mental <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>endurance.</b>|$|R
40|$|A healthy diet, {{designed}} to meet the specific demands imposed upon by the individual athlete’s training and competition, forms the basis upon which a maximal performance level can be obtained. Most athletes and coaches are well aware that diet and nutritional support should meet nutrient requirements to compensate for the metabolic demands imposed upon by intense exercise training and competition. As a result, nutritional interventions, with or without the use of specifically designed sports nutrition products, are widely applied to extend the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> human <b>endurance</b> and improve exercise performance capacity. In the 76 th Nestlé Nutrition Institute Workshop, a group of expert scientists in the field of nutrition and exercise discussed the ergogenic properties of various nutritional interventions and presented research to show that dietary strategies can be applied to extend the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> human <b>endurance...</b>|$|R
60|$|In that room, the old withdrawing-room of the Elizabethan wing--where {{once had}} been the embroideries, tapestries, and missals of beruffled dames were now books, pamphlets, oak-panels, pipes, fencing gear, and along one wall a {{collection}} of Red Indian weapons and ornaments brought back by Miltoun from the United States. High {{on the wall above}} these reigned the bronze death-mask of a famous Apache Chief, cast from a plaster taken of the face by a professor of Yale College, who had declared it to be a perfect specimen of the vanishing race. That visage, which had a certain weird resemblance to Dante's, presided over the room with cruel, tragic stoicism.

I do not care if she kills me the next time she meets me, for the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>endurance</b> have been passed. If she kills me I shall die a martyr in the cause of the Queen's peace.
