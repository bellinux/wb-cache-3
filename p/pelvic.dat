5|$|Acute <b>pelvic</b> {{inflammatory}} disease {{is highly unlikely}} when recent intercourse has not taken place or an IUD is not being used. A sensitive serum pregnancy test is typically obtained to rule out ectopic pregnancy. Culdocentesis will differentiate hemoperitoneum (ruptured ectopic pregnancy or hemorrhagic cyst) from <b>pelvic</b> sepsis (salpingitis, ruptured <b>pelvic</b> abscess, or ruptured appendix).|$|E
5|$|<b>Pelvic</b> {{inflammatory}} disease or <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory disorder (PID) is an {{infection of the}} upper part of the female reproductive system namely the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic <b>pelvic</b> pain, and cancer.|$|E
5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} {{from the}} two major species {{can be divided into}} two distinct size classes. The smaller class of specimens have small, rounded head crests and very wide <b>pelvic</b> canals, even wider than those of the much larger size class. The size of the <b>pelvic</b> canal probably allowed the laying of eggs, indicating that these smaller adults are females. The larger size class, representing male individuals, have narrow hips and very large crests, which were probably for display.|$|E
5|$|Other {{complications}} include endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, <b>pelvic</b> peritonitis, periappendicitis, and perihepatitis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pelvic</b> and vaginal {{ultrasounds}} {{are helpful}} {{in the diagnosis}} of PID. In {{the early stages of}} infection, the ultrasound may appear normal. As the disease progresses, nonspecific findings can include free <b>pelvic</b> fluid, endometrial thickening, uterine cavity distension by fluid or gas. In some instances the borders of the uterus and ovaries appear indistinct. Enlarged ovaries accompanied by increased numbers of small cysts correlates with PID.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} site of {{recurrence}} {{is in the}} vagina; vaginal relapses of endometrial cancer have the best prognosis. If relapse occurs from a cancer {{that has not been}} treated with radiation, EBRT is the first-line treatment and is often successful. If a cancer treated with radiation recurs, <b>pelvic</b> exenteration is the only option for curative treatment. Palliative chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and radiation are also performed. Radiation therapy (VBT and EBRT) for a local vaginal recurrence has a 50% five-year survival rate. <b>Pelvic</b> recurrences are treated with surgery and radiation, and abdominal recurrences are treated with radiation and, if possible, chemotherapy. Other common recurrence sites are the <b>pelvic</b> lymph nodes, para-aortic lymph nodes, peritoneum (28% of recurrences), and lungs, though recurrences can also occur in the brain (<1%), liver (7%), adrenal glands (1%), bones (4–7%; typically the axial skeleton), lymph nodes outside the abdomen (0.4–1%), spleen, and muscle/soft tissue (2–6%).|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are short}} and angular, while the <b>pelvic</b> fins {{are long and}} relatively large. The dorsal fins are small, with the first dorsal fin origin lying behind the <b>pelvic</b> fin origins. There is no anal fin. The caudal peduncle is robust and lacks notches at the caudal fin origins. The asymmetrical caudal fin has an indistinct lower lobe and an upper lobe without a notch in the trailing margin.|$|E
5|$|The {{sex of the}} {{different}} size classes was determined, not from the skulls, but from the <b>pelvic</b> bones. Contrary to what may be expected, the smaller size class had disproportionately large and wide-set <b>pelvic</b> bones. Bennett interpreted this as indicating a more spacious birth canal, through which eggs would pass. He concluded that the small size class with small, triangular crests represent females, and the larger, large-crested specimens represent males.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} <b>pelvic</b> fins {{are much}} longer than wide; adult males have claspers that extend past the <b>pelvic</b> fin rear tips. The broad and flattened tail is about a quarter longer than the disc and bears prominent skin folds along both sides. There are two dorsal fins of roughly equal size and shape, with the first originating over the rear tips of the <b>pelvic</b> fins. The tail terminates in a low caudal fin; the upper caudal fin lobe is somewhat angular, especially in adult males, while the lower lobe is rounded. The skin often bears creases and is devoid of dermal denticles. The Tasmanian numbfish is plain dark brown above, becoming lighter on the fins. The underside is white, sometimes with a few dark blotches. Many juveniles also exhibit a darker midline stripe along the back, along with darker blotches over the disc and at the dorsal fin bases.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{gynecologic}} ultrasound, {{a potential}} finding is tubo-ovarian complex, which is edematous and dilated <b>pelvic</b> structures {{as evidenced by}} vague margins, but without abscess formation.|$|E
5|$|Because PGAD is {{relatively}} rare and, {{as its own}} concept apart from clitoral priapism, has only been researched since 2001, there is little research into what may cure or remedy the disorder. In some recorded cases, PGAD was caused by, or caused, a <b>pelvic</b> arterial-venous malformation with arterial branches to the clitoris; surgical treatment was effective in these cases.|$|E
5|$|Blood is {{supplied}} to the cervix by the descending {{branch of the}} uterine artery and drains into the uterine vein. The <b>pelvic</b> splanchnic nerves, emerging as S2S3, transmit the sensation of pain from the cervix to the brain. These nerves travel along the uterosacral ligaments, which pass from the uterus to the anterior sacrum.|$|E
5|$|Both dorsal fins are {{immediately}} preceded by stout, grooved spines, {{with the second}} much longer than the first. The small first dorsal fin has a rounded apex and a nearly straight trailing margin, with its origin lying behind the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is rather angular and has about double {{the area of the}} first, with its origin located opposite the midpoint of the <b>pelvic</b> fin bases. The pectoral fins are small and rounded. The <b>pelvic</b> fins are about as large as the second dorsal fin, with rounded tips and nearly straight trailing margins. The caudal peduncle is short and leads to a broad caudal fin comprising {{less than a quarter of}} the total length; the upper lobe has a convex upper margin leading to a squared-off tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is densely covered by tiny dermal denticles; each one is recurved and thorn-like, rising from an irregular star-shaped base. This species is a plain dark brown above, darkening to almost black below, with white dorsal fin spines. Juvenile sharks have white edges on the dorsal, pectoral, and <b>pelvic</b> fins. Minute, luminescent dots are scattered about the skin without a regular pattern.|$|E
5|$|Branches also {{innervate}} {{muscles of}} the perineum and the <b>pelvic</b> floor; namely, the bulbospongiosus and the ischiocavernosus muscles respectively, the levator ani muscle (including the Iliococcygeus, pubococcygeus, puborectalis and either pubovaginalis in females or puboprostaticus in males) the external anal sphincter (via the inferior anal branch), and male or female external urethral sphincter.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial cancer {{frequently}} metastasizes to {{the ovaries}} and Fallopian tubes when the cancer {{is located in}} {{the upper part of the}} uterus, and the cervix when the cancer is in the lower part of the uterus. The cancer usually first spreads into the myometrium and the serosa, then into other reproductive and <b>pelvic</b> structures. When the lymphatic system is involved, the <b>pelvic</b> and para-aortic nodes are usually first to become involved, but in no specific pattern, unlike cervical cancer. More distant metastases are spread by the blood and often occur in the lungs, as well as the liver, brain, and bone. Endometrial cancer metastasizes to the lungs 20–25% of the time, more than any other gynecologic cancer.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for postmortem fetal {{extrusion}} {{may be less}} ambiguous {{when the}} fetal remains are found to lie within the <b>pelvic</b> outlet of the adult, thus indicating that partial extrusion had occurred during decomposition.|$|E
5|$|If {{the fetal}} remains {{are found in}} a fetal {{position}} and are wholly within the <b>pelvic</b> cavity of the adult, the fetus died and was interred prior to delivery. The pregnant woman may therefore have died due to labor complications.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, it was {{reported}} that during the excavation of a medieval cemetery in Kings Worthy, England, fetal remains appeared to lie within the birth canal of the skeleton of a young woman, with the fetal cranium external to the <b>pelvic</b> outlet and between the two femora (thigh bones) and the fetal leg bones clearly within the <b>pelvic</b> cavity. Other cases of coffin birth at archaeological sites have been described, such as in 1978 at a Neolithic site in Germany, at a medieval site in Denmark in 1982, and in 2009 at an Early Christian period site at Fingal, Ireland. A coffin birth was also described in a 2011 episode of the BBC show History Cold Case, featuring the Roman era remains of a woman and three neonates discovered near Baldock, Hertfordshire. Another was identified in 2006 in a 14th-century Black Death cemetery in Genoa, Italy.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{skeletal}} features that distinguish the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire, its closest relative, from pigeons {{have been attributed}} to their flightlessness. The <b>pelvic</b> elements were thicker than those of flighted pigeons to support the higher weight, and the pectoral region and the small wings were paedomorphic, meaning that they were underdeveloped and retained juvenile features. The skull, trunk and <b>pelvic</b> limbs were peramorphic, meaning that they changed considerably with age. The dodo shared several other traits with the Rodrigues solitaire, such as features of the skull, pelvis, and sternum, as well as their large size. It differed in other aspects, such as being more robust and shorter than the solitaire, having a larger skull and beak, a rounded skull roof, and smaller orbits. The dodo's neck and legs were proportionally shorter, and it did not possess an equivalent to the knob present on the solitaire's wrists.|$|E
5|$|No {{single test}} has {{adequate}} {{sensitivity and specificity}} to diagnose <b>pelvic</b> inflammatory disease. A large multisite U.S. study found that cervical motion tenderness as a minimum clinical criterion increases {{the sensitivity of the}} CDC diagnostic criteria from 83 percent to 95 percent. However, even the modified 2002 CDC criteria do not identify women with subclinical disease.|$|E
5|$|Other {{members of}} the clade may include Eoraptor from the same Ischigualasto Formation of Argentina as Herrerasaurus, Chindesaurus from the Upper Petrified Forest (Chinle Formation) of Arizona, and {{possibly}} Caseosaurus from the Tecovas Formation of the Dockum Group in Texas, although the relationships of these animals are not fully understood, and not all paleontologists agree. Other possible basal theropods, Alwalkeria from the Late Triassic Maleri Formation of India, and Teyuwasu, known from very fragmentary remains from the Late Triassic of Brazil, might be related. Paul (1988) noted {{that it had been}} incorrectly suggested that Staurikosaurus pricei was a juvenile Herrerasaurus. This claim was refuted when <b>pelvic</b> bones from a juvenile Herrerasaurus were discovered, which upon examination did not resemble the <b>pelvic</b> bones of Staurikosaurus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pelvic</b> {{inflammatory}} disease {{is more likely}} to reoccur when there is a prior history of the infection, recent sexual contact, recent onset of menses, or an IUD (intrauterine device) in place or if the partner has a sexually transmitted infection.|$|E
5|$|Sharks {{practice}} internal fertilization. The posterior {{part of a}} male shark's <b>pelvic</b> fins are modified {{into a pair of}} intromittent organs called claspers, {{analogous to}} a mammalian penis, of which one is used to deliver sperm into the female.|$|E
5|$|The Rodrigues {{solitaire}} shared traits {{with the}} dodo, its closest relative, such as size and {{features in the}} skull, pelvis and sternum. It differed in other aspects; it was taller and more slender than the dodo and had a smaller skull and beak, a flatter skull roof and larger orbits. Its neck and legs were proportionally longer, and the dodo did not possess an equivalent to the carpal knob of the Rodrigues solitaire. Many skeletal features of the Rodrigues solitaire and dodo that are unique among pigeons have evolved to adapt to flightlessness. Their <b>pelvic</b> elements were thicker than those of flighted birds (to support their greater weight), and their pectoral region and wings were paedomorphic (underdeveloped, retaining juvenile features). However, the skull, trunk and <b>pelvic</b> limbs were peramorphic, which means they changed considerably with maturity.|$|E
5|$|The {{anatomical}} {{structure of the}} internal organs and tissues of the female reproductive tract provides a pathway for pathogens to ascend from the vagina to the <b>pelvic</b> cavity thorough the infundibulum. The disturbance of the naturally occurring vaginal microbiota associated with bacterial vaginosis {{increases the risk of}} PID.|$|E
5|$|The body is deepest {{in front}} of the two tall and falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsal fins. The first dorsal fin is about a third larger than the second and {{originates}} over the <b>pelvic</b> fin origins. The second dorsal fin is located midway between the first dorsal and the caudal fin. The broad and triangular pectoral fins have a deep indentation where their leading margins meet the head. The <b>pelvic</b> fins are much smaller than the pectoral fins, and the anal fin is absent. The tail is much longer than the body and ends in a large, crescent-shaped caudal fin; the lower caudal fin lobe is more than half the length of the upper.|$|E
5|$|The burbot, a {{predatory fish}} native to streams and lakes of North America and Eurasia, is also {{commonly}} mistaken for bowfin. Burbots {{can be distinguished}} by their flat head and chin barbel, long anal fin, and <b>pelvic</b> fins situated beneath the pectoral fins.|$|E
5|$|The dorsal and <b>pelvic</b> fins are angular, {{with the}} first dorsal fin larger than the second. The {{pectoral}} fins are narrow, pointed, and falcate (sickle-shaped); their shape separates this species from the similar-looking nurse shark. The origin of the first dorsal fin is about even with {{the origin of the}} <b>pelvic</b> fins, while the origin of the anal fin is even with or somewhat behind the origin of the second dorsal fin. The caudal fin has a shallow upper lobe and barely present lower lobe, comprising {{about a quarter of the}} total length in adults. The dermal denticles are diamond-shaped, bearing 45 faint ridges radiating from a blunt point. Tawny nurse sharks are yellowish, reddish, or grayish brown above and off-white below, and are capable of slowly changing their color to better blend with the environment. Young sharks have starkly white lower eyelids.|$|E
5|$|The large <b>pelvic</b> fins {{originate}} {{beneath the}} disc and have convex trailing margins. Adult males have very short and thick claspers. The broad and flattened tail is {{shorter than the}} disc and bears a fold of skin along either side. There are two small dorsal fins, both with rounded to angular apices; the first is slightly smaller than the second, and its position varies from over to behind the <b>pelvic</b> fins. The caudal fin is triangular with rounded corners, and is roughly symmetrical above and below. The skin is soft and entirely devoid of dermal denticles.|$|E
5|$|The long, falcate (sickle-shaped) {{pectoral}} fins taper to narrowly pointed tips. The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is tall and}} positioned slightly closer to the pectoral fins than the <b>pelvic</b> fins. The <b>pelvic</b> fins are almost {{as large as the}} first dorsal fin and bear long, thin claspers in males. The second dorsal and anal fins are tiny, with the former positioned ahead of the latter. There are crescent-shaped notches on the caudal peduncle at the upper and lower origins of the caudal fin. The upper caudal fin lobe is enormously elongated as is characteristic of threshers, measuring about as long {{as the rest of the}} shark; the thin, gently curving lobe is held at a steep upward angle and has a notch in the trailing margin near the tip.|$|E
5|$|The partial {{skeleton}} {{was collected}} from the red floodplain mudstone of the Sebeș Formation of Romania. It consists {{of a variety of}} vertebrae, as well as much of pectoral and <b>pelvic</b> girdles, and {{a large part of the}} limbs. It is the first reasonably complete and well-preserved theropod from the Late Cretaceous of Europe.|$|E
5|$|The two dorsal fins are {{of nearly}} equal size and placed far {{back on the}} body, with the first {{originating}} over the latter third of the <b>pelvic</b> fin bases and the second over {{the latter half of}} the anal fin base. The pectoral and <b>pelvic</b> fins are broad and rounded; the males have stout claspers. The <b>pelvic</b> and anal fins are about as large as the dorsal fins. The broad caudal fin comprises about a fifth of the total body length and has a strong notch near the tip of the upper lobe and an indistinct lower lobe. The skin is thick and covered by well-calcified arrowhead-shaped dermal denticles. The coloration of the dark shyshark is highly variable, and particular individuals can resemble any of the other shyshark species. The background color ranges from light brown to reddish to grayish to almost black above, transitioning abruptly to white or cream below, sometimes with dark blotches beneath the paired fins. There may be 68 orange, brown, or blackish variably shaped saddles along the back and tail, edged more or less obviously in black. There may also be white spots within or within and between the saddles.|$|E
5|$|The two dorsal fins {{are roughly}} equal {{in size and}} placed far back on the body: the first {{originates}} behind {{the midpoint of the}} <b>pelvic</b> fin bases and the second behind the midpoint of the anal fin base. The pectoral fins are large, while the <b>pelvic</b> fins are small and low, with angular margins. The anal fin is much larger than either dorsal fin; its base measures 13–18% of the total length and greatly exceeds the distance between the <b>pelvic</b> and anal fins, or between the dorsal fins. The caudal peduncle is laterally compressed, {{with the end of the}} anal fin very close to the caudal fin. The caudal fin comprises around a quarter of the total length; the upper lobe is low with a ventral notch near the tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is very thick and covered by well-calcified dermal denticles. There is a prominent row of enlarged denticles, resembling saw teeth, along the upper edge of the caudal fin. The body is grayish-brown above, with 15–18 dark, rounded saddles, blotches, and/or spots that run onto the tail; each marking is highlighted by a paler border. The underside is white, as are the tips of the dorsal and caudal fins. The inside of the mouth is black.|$|E
5|$|Thoratic scutes on struthiosaurines are oval to {{teardrop}} shaped, and possess sharp ridges {{that rise}} distally. Some scutes {{were long and}} had small domes on them. The first primary osteoderms on the pelvis are large, compressed from the sides, and have a sharp, short point. S. sp. was preserved with five fragmentary scutes from the pelvis. One fragment includes two small scutes with a ridge down the middle, joining the two together, and a compressed osteoderm with a small spike. It is thought that the fragment was {{from the edge of}} the <b>pelvic</b> region. Another fragment includes two oval osteoderms with small ossicles fused between them. <b>Pelvic</b> shields were probably formed on struthiosaurines by these scutes.|$|E
5|$|A bikini {{is usually}} a women's {{abbreviated}} two-piece swimsuit with a bra top for the chest and underwear cut below the navel. The basic design is simple: two triangles of fabric on top cover the woman's breasts and two triangles of fabric on the bottom cover the groin in front and the buttocks in back. The size of a bikini bottom can range from full <b>pelvic</b> coverage to a revealing thong or G-string design.|$|E
5|$|Both sides cite strong evidence, and the {{conflict}} {{has yet to}} be resolved. The shell of testudines distinguishes them from other vertebrates. The shell is not an exoskeleton, but a modified ribcage and part of the vertebral column. Because of the shell, the pectoral and <b>pelvic</b> girdles are located within the ribcage. The limb bones are also modified to accommodate to the shell.|$|E
