Dell calls this feature PowerShare, while Toshiba calls it USB Sleep-and-Charge. On Acer Inc. and Packard Bell laptops, sleep-and-charge USB ports are marked with a non-standard symbol (the letters USB over a drawing of a battery); the feature is simply called Power-off USB. On some laptops such as Dell and Apple MacBook models, {{it is possible to}} plug a device in, close the laptop (<b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> sleep mode) and have the device continue to charge.|$|E
25|$|A slight {{problem with}} {{electrotyping}} of type {{is that the}} new form is slightly smaller than the original - according to Justin Howes, the calculation of the Stephenson Blake type foundry was that the shrinkage was on average 0.0038%. While obviously not very much, this deviance could accumulate if a letterform was repeatedly regenerated. Stephenson Blake's solution was to squash type slightly in a press or file it down to broaden it before <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the electrotype bath.|$|E
25|$|Reprocessing can {{potentially}} recover up to 95% {{of the remaining}} uranium and plutonium in spent nuclear fuel, <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> new mixed oxide fuel. This produces a reduction in long term radioactivity within the remaining waste, since this is largely short-lived fission products, and reduces its volume by over 90%. Reprocessing of civilian fuel from power reactors is currently done in Europe, Russia, Japan, and India. The full potential of reprocessing has not been achieved because it requires breeder reactors, which are not commercially available.|$|E

25|$|For the {{entrepreneurs}} the main challenge was that their newly created computer was {{the property of}} the NDRE, which again had a strategic cooperation with Kongsberg, both government-owned. They expressed interest in the technology and considered themselves <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> production. The other company which showed interest for the technology was the Horten-based Norcontrol, which was working on a project for ship automation but needed a computer to run the system. To raise capital, Skår took contact with his former college-mate Terje Mikalesen, who was working at Norcontrol. Mikalesen had married into a ship-owning family and was thus able to provide capital the others could not.|$|E
25|$|During 1793, the Spanish army won {{victories}} at the Siege of Bellegarde and the Battle of Truillas. These {{battles and}} other actions resulted in Spanish forces overrunning part of Roussillon, where France borders Spain on the Mediterranean Sea. On 16 January 1794, General of Division Jacques François Dugommier took {{command of the}} Army of the Eastern Pyrenees. The victor in the Siege of Toulon immediately reorganized the army, <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a state {{where it would be}} capable of taking the offensive. The new general began stockpiling supplies, establishing arms factories, setting up hospitals, and improving roads. By April, the field army counted 28,000 soldiers. These were backed up by 20,000 garrison troops and 9,000 raw volunteers.|$|E
25|$|A {{well-documented}} {{example of}} social transmission of a behaviour {{occurred in a}} group of macaques on Hachijojima Island, Japan. The macaques lived in the inland forest until the 1960s, when a group of researchers started giving them potatoes on the beach: soon, they started venturing onto the beach, picking the potatoes from the sand, and cleaning and eating them. About one year later, an individual was observed bringing a potato to the sea, <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the water with one hand, and cleaning it with the other. This behaviour was soon expressed by the individuals living in contact with her; when they gave birth, this behaviour was also expressed by their young - a form of social transmission.|$|E

25|$|The lower {{temperature}} of cooking (the boiling point of water) {{is a significant}} safety benefit compared to baking in the oven or frying, because it eliminates the formation of tars and char, which are carcinogenic. Microwave radiation also penetrates deeper than direct heat, so that the food is heated by its own internal water content. In contrast, direct heat can burn the surface while the inside is still cold. Pre-heating the food in a microwave oven before <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the grill or pan reduces {{the time needed to}} heat up the food and reduces the formation of carcinogenic char. Unlike frying and baking, microwaving does not produce acrylamide in potatoes, however unlike deep-frying, it is of only limited effectiveness in reducing glycoalkaloid (i.e. solanine) levels. Acrylamide has been found in other microwaved products like popcorn.|$|E
25|$|The first {{scheduled}} service with a Class 72 train occurred on 8 August 2002 on the Jæren Commuter Rail. NSB {{stated that they}} had never previously spent so much time testing equipment before <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> service, and that the Jæren had been chosen for the introduction because the single-line system was easier to operate than the services around Oslo. The company also stated that they hoped all the trains would be in service by the end of 2003. By January 2003, half the trains had been delivered, and were gradually being put into service on the Oslo Commuter Rail. However, on the Gardermoen Line the electronics from the train were interfering with the signaling systems, so the lights would switch from green to red before the train passed, instead of afterwards. This made it impossible for the NSB to put the train into service on Norway's only high-speed line. Another problem was that the trains would not close the doors if they were at a station without level tracks, although this was quickly solved. In 2003, NSB decided to abandon the Puls concept, and revert to the former single-profile strategy.|$|E

500|$|During the sessions, {{the band}} {{upgraded}} from 4-track recording to 8-track. As work began, Abbey Road Studios possessed, but {{had yet to}} install, an 8-track machine that had supposedly been sitting in a storage room for months. This was in accordance with EMI's policy of testing and customising new gear extensively before <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> use in the studios. The Beatles recorded [...] "Hey Jude" [...] and [...] "Dear Prudence" [...] at Trident because it had an 8-track recorder. When they learned that EMI also had one, they insisted on using it, and engineers Ken Scott and Dave Harries took the machine (without authorisation from the studio chiefs) into Abbey Road Studio 2 for the band's use.|$|E
500|$|Nevada Solar One uses {{parabolic}} troughs as thermal solar concentrators, heating {{tubes of}} liquid which act as solar receivers. These solar receivers are specially coated tubes {{made of glass}} and steel, and about 19,300 of these four meter long tubes {{are used in the}} plant. Nevada Solar One also uses a technology that collects extra heat by <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> phase-changing molten salts, which enable energy to be drawn at night. Using thermal energy storage systems, solar thermal operating periods can even be extended to meet baseload needs. Solar thermal power plants designed for solar-only generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in prosperous areas with significant cooling demands, such as the south-western United States.|$|E
500|$|Although Steven Spielberg {{initially}} negotiated {{to direct}} the film, he declined the offer. Spielberg reportedly wanted the adaptation to be an animated film, with American actor Haley Joel Osment to provide Harry Potter's voice, or a film that incorporated elements from subsequent books as well. Spielberg contended that, in his opinion, it was like [...] "shooting ducks in a barrel. It's just a slam dunk.
