40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{accuracy}} of stress analysis of blade wheels, one way Fluid-Structure Interaction method was introduced based on the comparisons of existing methods. Finite element analysis software ANSYS along with CFD software FLUENT were comprehensively used for the strength analysis of dual-chamber couplings. According to the simulation results from CFD, the node loads at the interface of <b>pump</b> <b>wheel</b> and the working fluid were obtained and the torque and axial force were predicated. Then the static stress of <b>pump</b> <b>wheel</b> was analyzed with ANSYS. The detail processes were described in this paper. The {{results show that the}} blades of <b>pump</b> <b>wheel</b> is loaded by alternating forces, and the maximum stress, which is 64 MPa, locates at the junction area of the blades and shell. And the coupling analyzed in this study meets the strength requirement. Introducion Hydrodynamic couplings are the most commonly used soft-start equipments for armored face conveyors in mining face. A coupling is arranged between the motor and speed reducer to make the conveyor start up smoothly, protect the motor and scraper chains when overloading occurs and improve the transmission quality. Considering the narrow space and explosive risk under coal mine, the large power coupling used in mining face adopts dual-chamber structure and pure water as th...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{field test}} {{results show that}} {{existing}} double-pump confluence hydraulic system with constant displacement <b>pump</b> of <b>wheel</b> loader could only save some energy while the load pressure is rather high(> 15 Mpa in the tests). However, the load pressure is usually low, especially when the wheel Loader is working on bulldozing operation or just steering and running. Thus, an optimized double-pump confluence hydraulic system was designed by adding a proportional valve and adjust operation rule, so that the output oil of steering pump flow into tank by the proportional valve while the load pressure is low and the relative position of joystick is not large(< 72 %), {{and in this way}} the throttle losses is reduced. Simulation results indicate that the optimized confluence hydraulic system could save 26. 2 % throttle losses while the wheel Loader is working on bulldozing operation...|$|R

50|$|The III {{is powered}} by an aluminium-alloy V12 engine of 447in³ (7.32L), having a bore of 3.25 inches (82.5 mm) and a stroke of 4.5 inches (114.3 mm). It is a pushrod engine with {{overhead}} valves operated by a single camshaft in the valley between the cylinder banks. Early cars had hydraulic tappets or, rather, a unique system of eccentric bushings in each individual rocker that was actuated by a small hydraulic piston; the eccentric bushing ensuring zero valve-lash at the rocker/valve interface. This system was changed to solid adjustable tappets in 1938. The Phantom III is unusual for its twin ignition systems, with two distributors, two coils and 24 spark plugs.
