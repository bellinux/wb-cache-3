50|$|The 5-2 Eagle has a (<b>passing)</b> <b>hole</b> in {{the middle}} of the defense, usually dealt with by having outside linebackers jam the ends. Offenses countered by using slot backs instead of tight ends. Consequently, teams began to experiment, around 1954, with pulling the middle guard back a couple yards and putting him in a 2-point stance. The success of the New York Giants in 1956 with their base 4-3 lead to a rapid {{conversion}} to the 4-3 in 1957. Almost all teams switched to the new defense at that time.|$|E

Hole production is provided with hand-guided tool. The review of the most widespread tool backup facilities according to manufacturing process analysis is state. Hole classification for CFRP/metal sandwiches was suggested according to the specific production step. Five types of holes produced in CFRP/ metal sandwiches was classified.

5000|$|Making {{altitude}} (elevation) {{measurements of}} the Sun being simple and direct, requiring the user to aligning {{the image of the}} Sun through the front pinhole (aperture), centered onto the rear back plate which operates more like a mask and not a viewing <b>pass</b> <b>hole</b> for sighting the Sun with the naked eye. Much {{in the same manner as}} performing eyepiece projection with a telescope, one fashioned with a front and rear aperture (font lens and rear eyepiece) along with a projection screen behind the eyepiece, or more rudimentary, the projecting of the Sun’s image upon a small screen plate such as that done with a mariner’s back staff. The rear, or second aperture (<b>pass</b> <b>hole)</b> having the function of working as a blacken attenuator so that any reflecting, annulus shaped sunlight off the metal aperture is not too bright, the Sun’s image (light) passing through the second hole and similar in task though void of a fixed image plane, to that of an iris (diaphragm) in a camera lens to reduce the light intensity. For relative to human physiology, focusing on a bright spot of light such as a pin point image of the Sun for any extended period or repetitively over a short duration of time adversely effects momentarily, a person’s visual acuity, thus making it more challenging to focus one’s eyes to read the angular scale. It being typical to orientate the instrument such that the operator faces looking slightly down upon the scale, the Sun at the users left, with right hand placed in such a way that the rays of sunlight pass through the two, perforated sighting plates, forming a bright illuminated spot on the observer’s finger (see photo), the finger functioning as a projection screen. At the moment an optical alignment with the Sun is established, the angular value of the device is read by the operator at the point where the graduated scale is bisected by the hanging plumb line.|$|R

The signal at the instant {{the electron}}s <b>pass</b> through the <b>hole</b> causes them to be accelerated (or decelerated).

Since the velocity sorting process takes time, the drift tube must often be several feet long.|$|R
