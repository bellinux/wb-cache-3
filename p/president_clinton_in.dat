25|$|Flynt has {{repeatedly}} {{weighed in on}} public debates by trying to expose conservative or Republican politicians with sexual scandals. He did so during the impeachment proceedings against <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>in</b> 1998, offering $1 million for evidence and publishing the results in The Flynt Report. These publications led to the resignation of incoming House Speaker Bob Livingston. In 2007, Flynt repeated his $1 million offer and also wrote the foreword to Joseph Minton Amann and Tom Breuer's The Brotherhood of Disappearing Pants: A Field Guide to Conservative Sex Scandals, which contained some cases published by Flynt.|$|E

In 1999 when the president was prepared to decide who would be pardoned before his final days in office, Gambino's name was on the list for consideration. Ultimately, the President did not grant Gambino a pardon.|$|E

25|$|Medicare {{has been}} in {{operation}} for a half century and, during that time, has undergone several changes. Since 1965, the provisions of Medicare have expanded to include benefits for speech, physical, and chiropractic therapy in 1972. Medicare added the option of payments to health maintenance organizations in the 1980s. Over the years, Congress expanded Medicare eligibility to younger people who have permanent disabilities and receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payments {{and those who have}} end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The association with HMOs begun in the 1980s was formalized under <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>in</b> 1997 as Medicare Part C. In 2003, under President George W. Bush, a Medicare program for covering almost all drugs was passed (and went into effect in 2006) as Medicare Part D.|$|E
25|$|Before it {{was turned}} off on May 2, 2000, typical SA errors were about 50m (164ft) {{horizontally}} and about 100m (328ft) vertically. Because SA affects every GPS receiver in a given area almost equally, a fixed station with an accurately known position can measure the SA error values and transmit them to the local GPS receivers so they may correct their position fixes. This is called Differential GPS or DGPS. DGPS also corrects for several other important sources of GPS errors, particularly ionospheric delay, so {{it continues to be}} widely used even though SA has been turned off. The ineffectiveness of SA in the face of widely available DGPS was a common argument for turning off SA, and this was finally done by order of <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>in</b> 2000.|$|E

During Emanuel's time on the board, Freddie Mac was plagued with scandals involving campaign contributions and accounting irregularities. The Bush Administration rejected a request under the Freedom of Information Act to review Freddie Mac board minutes and correspondence during Emanuel's time as a director. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight later accused the board of having [...] "failed in its duty to follow up on matters brought to its attention." [...] Emanuel resigned from the board in 2001 before his first bid for Congress.|$|E

2500|$|The Lewinsky scandal was an American {{political}} {{sex scandal}} that involved 49-year-old President Bill Clinton and 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The sexual relationship {{took place between}} 1995 and 1996 and came to light in 1998. Clinton ended a televised speech {{with the statement that}} he did not have sexual relations with Lewinsky. [...] Further investigation led to charges of perjury and to the impeachment of <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>in</b> 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives. He was subsequently acquitted on all impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in a 21-day Senate trial. Clinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony in the Paula Jones case regarding Lewinsky and was also fined $90,000 by Wright. His license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years; shortly thereafter, he was disbarred from presenting cases in front of the United States Supreme Court.|$|E

2500|$|The phrase [...] "Groundhog Day" [...] {{has entered}} common usage as a {{reference}} to an unpleasant situation that continually repeats. Goldberg paraphrased the common meaning as [...] "same stuff, different day".

A magazine article about the aircraft carrier [...] mentions its use by sailors in September 1993.
