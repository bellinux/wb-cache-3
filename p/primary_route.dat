5|$|Krohn Air AS was a virtual, {{regional}} airline whose <b>primary</b> <b>route</b> {{was between}} Molde Airport, Årø to Trondheim Airport, Værnes in Norway. The airline {{was established in}} 2010 after Scandinavian Airlines {{pulled out of the}} Molde–Trondheim route. The airline aimed at the business segment, with early morning departures and two daily round trips.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>primary</b> <b>route</b> to southwestern England, the A303 is {{frequently}} congested on its single carriageway sections. As {{it passes through}} the Stonehenge World Heritage Site and the Blackdown Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, attempts to upgrade the road in those areas have been controversial. In particular, the Stonehenge tunnel, which would see the A303 rerouted underground, has been proposed and delayed several times. Nevertheless, the road remains a popular alternative to motorway driving, and was commemorated in a book and BBC Four television documentary by Tom Fort in the early 2010s.|$|E
5|$|Despite this reserve, early {{settlers}} {{extended their}} fences to the river. In 1791, the Land Board ordered that the fences be removed {{to permit the}} reserve's use as a public road. The Niagara Road quickly became the <b>primary</b> <b>route</b> between Fort Erie and Fort George. Its importance grew with the declaration of war against the Americans in June 1812. During the war, the road became vital for the movement of militia and supplies, and accordingly {{it was one of}} the primary frontiers of the war.|$|E
25|$|Some A {{roads are}} {{designated}} trunk roads, which implies that central government rather than local government has responsibility for them.

5|$|K-140's route was {{established}} in 1925 as U.S. Route 40S. By 1936, the route had become the <b>primary</b> <b>route</b> of US-40, with the old US-40N becoming U.S. Route 24. By 1969, after the majority of Interstate 70 had been completed, US-40 was rerouted to be concurrent with the newly constructed highway, and the old route of US-40 between Ellsworth and Salina was resigned as K-140. The routing of K-140 has remained unchanged since. The K-140 route has been a paved road since at least 1932.|$|E
5|$|The future {{eastern half}} of Highway 82 came first, as a rough path over Independence Pass that soon reached Aspen. A private company {{improved}} it into a toll road for stagecoaches, open year-round. The city's rapid growth fostered a race {{to make the first}} rail connection, which displaced the toll road as the <b>primary</b> <b>route</b> to Aspen within a decade. Later, the railroad's right-of-way would {{serve as the basis for}} the highway.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{route of}} SR522 is {{designated}} {{as part of}} the National Highway System, classifying it as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. The State of Washington also designates the SR522 corridor as a Highway of Statewide Significance, which includes highways that connect major communities throughout the state. The highway is the <b>primary</b> <b>route</b> for Seattle-area residents to access Stevens Pass {{and other parts of the}} Cascade Mountains. SR522 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on the state's highways to measure traffic volume in terms of average annual daily traffic. In 2016, WSDOT calculated that 96,000 vehicles used SR522 at its interchange with I-405 and 12,000 vehicles used it at its eastern terminus in Monroe, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{north into}} the town of Sparta, NY63 runs along {{the east side of}} a wide, rural valley {{surrounding}} Canaseraga Creek, with NY36 and I-390 following the west side. The route eventually reaches the town of Groveland and hamlet of Groveland Station, where NY258, a connector to NY36, comes in from the west at the town line. Another long, open stretch brings the route to the vicinity of the village of Mount Morris, where it runs much closer to I-390 and indirectly connects to the expressway by way of NY408 at Hampton Corners. From this point north, the road becomes busier as NY63 is the <b>primary</b> <b>route</b> to the village of Geneseo for northbound traffic on I-390 itself, as there is no exit {{at the point where the}} expressway crosses under NY63. I-390 ultimately bypasses Geneseo to the southeast while NY63 heads north toward the village, briefly joining with U.S. Route20A (US20A) and NY39 just outside the village limits.|$|E
5|$|A 1923 {{restructuring}} of the system re-assigned numbers to almost all the primary state highways. State Road 5 became a <b>primary</b> <b>route</b> and was greatly expanded, taking over the entire McClellan Pass Highway and the National Park Highway east of the Pacific Highway. The former secondary State Road 5 was realigned starting from near Packwood, heading north instead of east, alongside the Ohanapecosh River to the old McClellan Pass Highway at Cayuse Pass, west of {{the summit of the}} Cascades. The new State Road 5, named the National Park Highway System, now included four roads in the vicinity of Mount Rainier National Park, but as the road across the Cascades at Chinook Pass was not yet built, these roads did not connect with each other. Also included in this numbering was the designation of the Inland Empire Highway, including Yakima to Clarkston, as State Road 3. In 1925, a spur was added to State Road 9—the Olympic Highway, looping around the Olympic Peninsula—connecting Elma to the Pacific Highway at Grand Mound, and creating a shortcut between the Cowlitz River route and Aberdeen. The Olympic Highway from Elma west to Aberdeen had been added to the state highway system in 1905 west of and 1913 east of Montesano.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{its central}} location, Launceston is {{the hub of}} five of the state's major highways. The Midland Highway is the <b>primary</b> <b>route</b> to Hobart.

The Tasman Highway is an {{alternate}} scenic route to Hobart via Scottsdale, the East Coast, the West Tamar Highway and East Tamar Highway.|$|E
