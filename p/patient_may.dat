5|$|A <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> be {{discharged}} by revocation {{if he or}} she chooses to relinquish the hospice benefit. Revocation could be due to hospitalization, if the patient chooses to pursue some type of curative treatment or experiences dissatisfaction with hospice care. However, not all hospitalizations of patients require revocation; should the admitting diagnosis to the hospital be unrelated to the condition for which they are in hospice, the <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> remain on hospice while undergoing treatment for it.|$|E
5|$|Others {{contend that}} the first <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> have {{contracted}} the disease while visiting Uyaly or Komsomolsk-on-Ustyurt, two cities where the boat docked.|$|E
5|$|Some {{confusion}} {{still exists}} {{as to what}} treatments a <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> receive in hospice care. Hospices may provide treatments that have been traditionally regarded as curative, including radiation therapy or antibiotics, if these are administered to improve quality of life. Determination of appropriate treatment is made by medical personnel on an individual basis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Patients</b> <b>may</b> have no {{specific}} symptoms. In some cases, <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> complain of lessened visual acuity or {{changes in their}} perceived visual field, and such changes may be secondary to or different from symptoms normally associated with cataracts or glaucoma.|$|R
50|$|On {{examination}} the <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> have weakness, {{and loss}} of deep tendon reflexes (rarely increased or normal). There may be atrophy (shrinkage) of muscles, fasciculations (twitching) {{and loss of}} sensation. <b>Patients</b> <b>may</b> have multi-focal motor neuropathy, as they have no sensory loss.|$|R
5000|$|With time <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> develop {{respiratory}} autophonia. At this stage, {{they hear}} [...] "from inside”. They describe hearing their own respiration and sometimes other bodily functions, like heartbeat. Some <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> find this unbearable and depression is common. Psychological supervision may be indicated.|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} of discharges from hospice {{are due to}} the death of the patient, although hospice treatment may not end then as care also provides for a period of bereavement counseling for the family afterward. However, there are several other scenarios when a <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> be discharged from hospice.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} {{should not}} be used without a medical indication, such as with a reason to expect that a person is at heightened risk of having deep vein thrombosis. This screening is not effective at diagnosing DVT in the absence of other indications that the <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> have this condition. A common example of overuse of this procedure is the practice of performing ultrasonography routinely on patients without indication after knee or hip replacement.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} typically reveals {{fluid in}} the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The tenderness may initially spread, but often reverts to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses. Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies, acute osteochondral fracture {{has a similar}} presentation with tenderness in the affected joint, but is usually associated with a fatty hemarthrosis. Although {{there is no significant}} pathologic gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Patients</b> <b>may</b> {{exhibit a}} “second wind” phenomenon. This is {{characterized}} by the patient’s better tolerance for aerobic exercise such as walking and cycling after approximately 10 minutes. [...] This is attributed to the combination of increased blood flow and the ability of the body to find alternative sources of energy, like fatty acids and proteins. In the long term, <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> exhibit renal failure due to the myoglobinuria, and with age, <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> exhibit progressively increasing weakness and substantial muscle loss.|$|R
50|$|<b>Patients</b> <b>may</b> develop {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed lung).|$|R
50|$|After {{successful}} treatment, 35 {{percent of}} the <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> experience a recurrence within a 40-year span. Also, <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> experience {{a high incidence of}} nodule metastasis, with 35 percent cases of cervical node metastases. Approximately 20 percent of patients will develop multiple tumors within the thyroid gland.|$|R
5|$|Renal {{replacement}} therapy {{may be required}} to bridge individuals with hepatorenal syndrome to liver transplantation, although the condition of the <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> dictate the modality used. The use of dialysis, however, does not lead to recuperation or preservation of kidney function in patients with HRS, and is essentially only used to avoid complications of kidney failure until transplantation can take place. In patients who undergo hemodialysis, there may even be an increased risk of mortality due to low blood pressure in patients with HRS, although appropriate studies have yet to be performed. As a result, the role of renal {{replacement therapy}} in patients with HRS remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{vary depending on}} {{what part of the}} tracheobronchial tree is injured and how severely it is damaged. There are no direct signs of TBI, but certain signs suggest the injury and raise a clinician's suspicion that it has occurred. Many of the signs {{and symptoms}} are also present in injuries with similar injury mechanisms such as pneumothorax. Dyspnea and respiratory distress are found in 76–100% of people with TBI, and coughing up blood has been found in up to 25%. However, isolated TBI does not usually cause profuse bleeding; if such bleeding is observed {{it is likely to be}} due to another injury such as a ruptured large blood vessel. The <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> exhibit dysphonia or have diminished breath sounds, and rapid breathing is common. Coughing may be present, and stridor, an abnormal, high-pitched breath sound indicating obstruction of the upper airway can also occur.|$|E
50|$|Older <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> {{have certain}} {{conditions}} that increase their chance of nail and foot problems. Aging itself {{can result in}} nailbed changes to fingernails and toenails. <b>Patients</b> <b>may</b> have poor vision, poor coordination, or {{not be able to}} bend over {{to take care of their}} nails.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> {{manifest}} premature pubarche and hyperandrogenism.|$|R
50|$|Patients display early {{symptoms}} within 1 to 2 {{weeks after}} tick infection. Early symptoms include fever, headache, malaise, low-back pain, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Some <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> also have myalgias, arthralgias, {{and an estimated}} 10-40% of <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> develop coughing, pharyngitis, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and changes in mental status.|$|R
5|$|Symptoms are {{dependent}} {{on the type of}} TBI (diffuse or focal) and {{the part of the brain}} that is affected. Unconsciousness tends to last longer for people with injuries on the left side of the brain than for those with injuries on the right. Symptoms are also dependent on the injury's severity. With mild TBI, the <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> remain conscious or may lose consciousness for a few seconds or minutes. Other symptoms of mild TBI include headache, vomiting, nausea, lack of motor coordination, dizziness, difficulty balancing, lightheadedness, blurred vision or tired eyes, ringing in the ears, bad taste in the mouth, fatigue or lethargy, and changes in sleep patterns. Cognitive and emotional symptoms include behavioral or mood changes, confusion, and trouble with memory, concentration, attention, or thinking. Mild TBI symptoms may also be present in moderate and severe injuries.|$|E
5|$|The hospice {{interdisciplinary}} team is {{the core}} service which every hospice provides to patients and families. Hospice differs from other forms of care in that the core members of the hospice team function as an interdisciplinary, rather than a multidisciplinary, team. Multidisciplinary teams involve several professionals who independently treat various issues a <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> have. The problems that are being treated {{may or may not}} relate to other issues being addressed by individual team members. Interdisciplinary team approach involves all members of the team working together towards the same goal, which in this case is to afford patients a comfortable dying experience and families the support they need in coping with this. In an interdisciplinary team approach, there can often be role blending by members of the core team, who may take on tasks usually filled by other team members.|$|E
25|$|During the {{duration}} of the two-year period, the <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> have had a perpetual major depressive episode.|$|E
50|$|There is {{evidence}} suggesting that although amnestic MCI <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> not meet neuropathologic criteria for Alzheimer's disease, <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> be in a transitional stage of evolving Alzheimer's disease; patients in this hypothesized transitional stage demonstrated diffuse amyloid in the neocortex and frequent neurofibrillary tangles in the medial temporal lobe.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> develop pneumonia, lymphadenopathy, or septic arthritis.|$|R
50|$|Depending on lesion location, some <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> {{experience}} visual complications.|$|R
25|$|In case of sporotrichosis meningitis, the <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> {{be given}} a {{combination}} of Amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine/Flucytosine.|$|E
25|$|Projection of hope: Also, {{in a more}} {{positive}} light, a <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> sometimes project his or her feelings of hope onto the therapist.|$|E
25|$|The {{programme}} {{suggests the}} provision of treatments to manage pain, agitation, respiratory tract secretions, nausea and vomiting, or shortness of breath (dyspnoea) that the <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> experience.|$|E
5000|$|Even with {{successful}} surgery, <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> {{have long-term}} problems with: ...|$|R
5000|$|... <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> also {{experience}} {{effects on}} {{the central nervous system}} ...|$|R
5|$|<b>Patients</b> <b>may</b> {{also feel}} {{fatigued}} {{for a short}} period following treatment.|$|R
25|$|In hand malformations, {{the thumb}} {{is most often}} affected, {{followed}} by the fifth finger (the little finger). In severe cases, the <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> only have three fingers and in rare cases only one.|$|E
25|$|Grade 2 (moderate edema): Involves {{an entire}} limb or {{corresponding}} quadrant of the trunk. Difference in circumference is 4–6cm. Tissue changes, such as pitting, are apparent. The <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> experience erysipelas.|$|E
25|$|If {{there are}} complications, the <b>patient</b> <b>may</b> {{need to stay}} in the foreign country for longer than planned or if they have {{returned}} home, will not have easy access for follow up care.|$|E
50|$|Neurologic system findings: <b>Patients</b> <b>may</b> have {{learning}} {{difficulties and}} mental retardation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Patients</b> <b>may</b> {{not be able}} {{to receive}} certain types of care due to the risk that other <b>patients</b> <b>may</b> become contaminated. This {{includes}} forms of care that involve use of equipment common to all patients at the facility, or that involve transporting the patient to an area of the facility common to all patients.|$|R
25|$|<b>Patients</b> <b>may</b> better {{cope with}} the dental {{treatment}} when free from pain.|$|R
