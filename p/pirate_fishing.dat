Together, they have pioneered a system that enables government officials and other analysts to identify and monitor unlawful activities in global waters, particularly illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, sometimes referred to as <b>pirate</b> <b>fishing.</b> This cutting-edge technology merges satellite tracking and imagery data with other sources of information, such as fishing vessel databases and oceanographic data, to help monitor seas across the globe...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 This study {{addresses}} the social dimensions of trade (sometimes called “non-trade” issues, values, or objectives) in Southeast Asia. It {{was inspired by}} two major events: the debacle of the third World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting in Seattle in 1999, and the visibility of trade liberalization and economic integration in creating a single market and production base in Southeast Asia - the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Community (AEC) by 2015. Influenced by the school of legal realism and interdisciplinary sociolegal studies, this study seeks to examine {{the way in which}} the global trade governance regarding non-trade issues have been institutionalized and addressed in Southeast Asia. To examine the relationship between the impact of globalization and legal adaptation and development on global trade governance in Southeast Asia, this study investigates three contemporary problems regarding trade-related aspects of labor, environment and culture in Southeast Asia. The three problems to be investigated are: (1) <b>pirate</b> <b>fishing</b> and modern slavery in the Thai fishing industry (trade and labor); (2) illegal Siamese rosewood logging and trade in the Greater Mekong sub-region (trade and environment); and (3) tourism development and the struggles of Andaman sea gypsies (trade in service and culture). Based on a problem-based approach and factually-contextual analysis, this study applies doctrinal legal research and qualitative research methods to draw analytic generalizations and a legal normative proposition regarding ASEAN’s response to global trade governance. The study contends that ASEAN should respond more effectively to global trade governance in the region by revising the ASEAN social policy, ASEAN Social Charter and other legal instruments in such a way as to address “non-trade” issues in a more responsible manner. In particular, ASEAN should strengthen traceability, transparency, international cooperation, recognition and participation as features of global trade governance in order to protect human rights, the environment and local cultures. By doing so, it will not only enhance democracy, good governance and the rule of law in the region, but also pave the way for ASEAN regional stability and sustainability—the underlying principles and purposes stated in the ASEAN Charter...|$|E
40|$|At 0800 the Sea Eagle, the F 406 {{surveillance}} aircraft {{is ready for}} take off from Eros airport, a few kilometres from Windhoek. A lunar landscape separates Windhoek from the ocean but as the aircraft reaches the coast the radar begins to pick up echoes from boats at sea. As the plane comes in close, the fisheries inspector notes the fishing licence numbers which should be clearly visible on {{the two sides of}} the wheelhouse. The navigational position of the ship is also noted and the type of fishing gear in use. On his return the inspector will be able to check his information with the register held at the Ministry of Fisheries office in Swakopmund and identify those fishing without authority. Tomorrow it will be the northern zone on the flight plan for surveillance. The northern zone is a particularly sensitive area because here fishermen rely on the uncertain demarcation between the borders of Angola and Namibia to try and avoid coming under the maritime laws of either country. The seas off the coast of Namibia have some of the best fish stocks in the world and before Independence these were freely plundered by foreign vessels. An aerial surveillance system has now been set up to control illegal fishing. Once spotted from the sky, <b>pirate</b> <b>fishing</b> boats have nowhere to hide. Fishing off the Namibian coast does not always bring good luck to the fishermen, as the shipwrecks that lie broken and battered by the waves can testify. Some are more than 400 years old; the 'Skeleton coast' is well named. It has always been a treacherous coastline, swept by violent storms, shrouded in thick fog and lapped by the cold ocean current, the Benguela, which flows up from the south polar seas. But this coastline borders one of the richest fishing grounds in the world. Along the whole African coast, Mauritania is its nearest rival although its potential production is less than half that of Namibia. Westerly winds force the cold Benguela current against Namibia's narrow continental shelf bringing water rich in oxygen and mineral nutrients to the surface in an effect known as upwelling. The combination of nutrient rich water and the sun results in blooms of plankton, a source of food for the shoals of cod, mackerel, anchovy, hake and sardines. Current production of sardines is 500, 000 tonnes per year, production of cod is 800, 000 tonnes per year and production of crayfish, which are concentrated further south near Luderitz, is 900 tonnes per year. The good times - are over It is clear that in the past fish stocks were greater than they are now. In 1968 catches of all fish totalled 1. 5 million tonnes. But the foreign boats which came to fish had no interest in conserving the fish stock and by 1990 catches were less than a third of those obtained in the 160 s. On 21 March 1990, Namibia gained Independence, and with it the need to earn foreign exchange. Fish are the country's most valuable natural resource, after diamonds, and represent about 15...|$|E

5000|$|Most {{foods are}} {{swallowed}} whole, including most fish and even other gulls. When foods are {{too large to}} be swallowed at once, they will sometimes be shaken in the bill until they fall apart into pieces. Like some other gulls, when capturing molluscs or other hard-surfaced foods such as eggs, they will fly into the air with it and drop it on rocks or hard earth to crack it open. Alternate foods, including berries and insects, are eaten when available. They will readily exploit easy food sources, including chum lines made by boats at sea. They are skilled kleptoparasites who will readily <b>pirate</b> <b>fish</b> and other prey captured by other birds and dominate over other gulls when they encounter them. At tern colonies in coastal Maine, American herring gulls (L. smithsonianus) occasionally also attack nestling and fledging terns but in a great majority of cases were immediately pirated of their catch by great black-backs. In one observation, an adult great black-back was seen to rob a female peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) of a freshly caught gadwall (Anas strepera). In another case, a third-year great black-back was observed fighting an adult female northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) off its kill, although the goshawk attempted to strike the gull before leaving. Due to their method of using intimidation while encountering other water and raptorial birds, the species {{has been referred to}} as a [...] "merciless tyrant". Naturally, these gulls are attracted to the surface activity of large marine animals, from Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) to humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), to capture fish driven to the surface by such creatures.|$|R

Captured as a youth by Irish <b>pirates</b> while <b>fishing</b> at sea, he is said to have escaped by using a wooden buckler for a boat; he landed at the fishing weir of Elffin, one of the sons of Urien (all medieval Welsh sources, however, make Elffin the son of Gwyddno Garanhir). Urien made him Elffin's instructor, and gave Taliesin an estate. But once introduced to the court of the warrior-chief Taliesin became his foremost bard, followed him in his wars, and wrote of his victories.|$|R

He managed to escape in March 1723 when the pirates landed at Roatán Island in the Bay Islands of Honduras, hiding in the jungle until the pirates decided to depart without him. He survived for 16 months, in spite of many insects, tropical heat and alligators.

50|$|Although Michael {{has become}} a more mature {{individual}} since the first film and shows more concern for others, he still feels that by birthright he deserves {{to start at the}} top of his father's law firm. Michael's father does offer him a position at the law firm: a clerking job, and explains that only after throughout knowledge of the firm, a law school graduation and passing the state bar will he ever be considered for a partnership. Michael takes a summer vacation with Tommy to Australia. Michael has big plans to show his cousin Tommy a good time aboard a luxury yacht, until he discovers that the yacht he chartered is actually an old, rusty fishing boat. But when modern-day <b>pirates</b> chase the <b>fishing</b> boat, the boys are forced to jump ship, leaving them stranded on a desert island. The pirates are led by Frakes, whom earlier had pickpocketed Michael and discovered through his ID that he comes from a wealthy family. The pirates plans to kidnap Michael for a large ransom. Meanwhile, Tommy and Michael struggle to find their way on the island to be met by the boat's captain, Jake Hunter, who scuttled the fishing boat to lose the pirates. He later admits he hated being a fishing boat captain and only stuck with it because it was his late father's calling. Frakes find the boys and attempts to shoot them, but fails due to his firearm being gunked up with quicksand he had gotten trapped in earlier while stalking the boys; who then outwit the pirates by absconding in their speedboat, leaving the villains stranded. As the boys escape they call the Australian Coast Guard for help. The pirates are arrested and their speedboat is seized. During a lunch the boys have with Michael's father and Tommy's mom, Michael arrives and tells Jake and Tommy that due to asset forfeiture, Frakes' boat is now their property. Michael proposes using the speedboat, combined with the reward money, to launch a boat tour service with Jake and Tommy as his partners, and Jake captaining the boat. Michael also tells his father that he will begin the process for law school application, and accepts his dad's clerking job to help him prepare for that. Michael's father is proud of him for going into the business with him (but now with a more mature view), now realizing the wrongfulness of blood favoritism, and that there is no royal road to success.|$|R
