We show that the <b>partial</b> <b>dependencies</b> can be characterized by the closure operations of the poset formed by the partial functions on the attributes of the databases. On the other hand, we give necessary and sufficient conditions so that for such a closure operation one can find on the given set of attributes a database whose <b>partial</b> <b>dependencies</b> generate the given closure operation. We also investigate some questions about how to realize certain structures related to databases by a database of minimal number of rows, columns or elements...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} <b>partial</b> <b>dependency</b> parser for Irish, in which Constraint Grammar (CG) rules are used to {{annotate}} dependency relations and grammatical functions in unrestricted Irish text. Chunking is performed using a regular-expression grammar which operates on the dependency tagged sentences. As {{this is the first}} implementation of a parser for unrestricted Irish text (to our knowledge), there were no guidelines or precedents available. Therefore deciding what constitutes a syntactic unit, and how it should be annotated, accounts for {{a major part of the}} early development effort. Currently, all tokens in a sentence are tagged for grammatical function and local dependency. Long-distance dependencies, prepositional attachments or coordination are not handled, resulting in a <b>partial</b> <b>dependency</b> analysis. Evaluations show that the <b>partial</b> <b>dependency</b> analysis achieves an f-score of 93. 60 % on development data and 94. 28 % on unseen test data, while the chunker achieves an f-score of 97. 20 % on development data and 93. 50 % on unseen test data. 1...|$|R

Adding indirect supervision (e. g. language universals and rules) can help, but we show that obtaining small amounts of direct supervision - here, <b>partial</b> <b>dependency</b> annotations - provides a strong balance between zero and full supervision. We adapt the unsupervised ConvexMST dependency parser to learn from <b>partial</b> <b>dependencies</b> expressed in the Graph Fragment Language.

40|$|The {{application}} of linguistic patterns and rules {{are one of}} the main approaches for Information Extraction as well as for highquality ontology population. However, the lack of flexibility of the linguistic patterns often causes low coverage. This paper presents a weakly-supervised rule-based approach for Relation Extraction which performs <b>partial</b> <b>dependency</b> parsing in order to simplify the linguistic structure of a sentence. This simplification allows us to apply generic semantic extraction rules, obtained with a distantsupervision strategy which takes advantage of semi-structured resources. The rules are added to a <b>partial</b> <b>dependency</b> grammar, which is compiled into a parser capable of extracting instances of the desired relations. Experiments in different Spanish and Portuguese corpora show that this method maintains the highprecision values of rule-based approaches while improves the recall of these systems. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Activity {{diagrams}} are {{a well-known}} means {{to model the}} control flow of system behavior. Their expressiveness can be enhanced by using their object flow notation. In addition, we refine activities by pairs of pre- and post-conditions formulated by interrelated object diagrams. To define a clear semantics for refined activity diagrams with object flow, we use a graph transformation approach. Con-trol flow is formalized by sets of transformation rule sequences, while object flow is described by <b>partial</b> <b>dependencies</b> between transformation rules. The theory of algebraic graph transformation {{can be used to}} validate the consistency of control and object flows in refined activity diagrams. This approach is illustrated by a simple service-based on-line university calendar. ...|$|R

Depending on the interests of the communicating parties, some facts lead to conclusions that carry a high risk when ignored, and others may not be worth the resources to share the facts leading to those uninteresting conclusions. This paper studies the worst-case semantic data compression problem for sharing facts that lead to conclusions with such varying priorities. We establish the performance bounds by utilizing the <b>partial</b> <b>dependencies</b> between the ideas and the priority distributions on the conclusions. We show that multiple term descriptions of the facts and conclusions improve the compression performance when combined with judicious partitioning of the fact space. ...|$|R

Aim: To perform a geriatric assessment to elderly subjects consulting in a public outpatient clinic. Patients and methods: A cross sectional assessment of subjects over 60 years old, beneficiaries {{of the public health}} care system and consulting in 4 outpatient clinics of a poor community of Metropolitan Santiago. Evaluation included a complete medical history, the Katz score for activities of daily living (ADL), Lawton score for instrumental activities for daily living (IADL) and Folstein Mini Mental state examination.

We find that including n> 1 parses helps, especially if one incorporates probabilistic weights from the parser. Additionally, we find that matching simple words (along with partial-dependencies) further improves correlations with human judgments.

TAN is a state-of-the-art extension of naive Bayes, that can express limited forms of inter-dependence among attributes. Rough sets theory provides tools for expressing inexact or <b>partial</b> <b>dependencies</b> within dataset. In this paper, we present a variant of TAN using rough sets theory and compare their tree classifier structures, which {{can be thought of as}} a selective restricted trees Bayesian classifier.

To build the index, we use a dependency parser to parse a large corpus. We extract binary dependency relations, such as he-subj-say (he is the subject of say) as index terms and construct the index using publicly available open-source indexing software. The unit we index over is the sentence. The index can be used to extract grammatical relations and frequency counts for these relations. The framework also provides the possibility to search for <b>partial</b> <b>dependencies</b> (say, the frequency of he occurring in subject position), words, strings and a combination of these.

We show how the <b>partial</b> <b>dependency</b> trees projected from English to Dutch, Italian and German can be exploited to train parsers for the target languages. We evaluate the parsers against manual gold standard annotations and find that the projected parsers substantially outperform our heuristic baseline by 9 – 25 % UAS, which corresponds to a 21 – 43 % reduction in error rate. A comparative error analysis focuses on how the projected target language parsers handle subjects, which is especially interesting for Italian as an instance of a pro-drop language. For Dutch, we further present experiments with German as an alternative source language. In both source languages, we contrast standard baseline parsers with parsers that are enhanced with the predictions from large-scale LFG grammars through a technique of parser stacking, and show that improvements of the source language parser can directly lead to similar improvements of the projected target language parser. ...|$|R

40|$|Predicting the {{reliability}} of software systems based on a component-based approach is inherently difficult, in particular due to failure dependencies between software compo-nents.

Exactly how {{the structure of the}} kinetochore changes during mitosis and how its individual components contribute to chromosome segregation is largely unknown. Here we have focused on the contribution of the Mis 12 complex to kinetochore assembly and function throughout mitosis in Drosophila. We show that despite the sequential kinetochore recruitment of Mis 12 complex subunits Mis 12 and Nsl 1, the complex acts as a single functional unit. mis 12 and nsl 1 mutants show strikingly similar developmental and mitotic defects in which chromosomes are able to congress at metaphase, but their anaphase movement is strongly affected. While kinetochore association of Ndc 80 absolutely depends on both Mis 12 and Nsl 1, BubR 1 localization shows only <b>partial</b> <b>dependency.</b> In the presence of residual centromeric BubR 1 the checkpoint still responds to microtubule depolymerization but is significantly weaker. These observations point to a complexity of the checkpoint response that may reflect subpopulations of BubR 1 associated with residual kinetochore components, the core centromere, or elsewhere in the cell. Importantly our results indicate that core structural elements of the inner plate of the kinetochore have a greater contribution to faithful chromosome segregation in anaphase than in earlier stages of mitosis...|$|R

Although linear regression is used routinely in the mineral process industries for this purpose, it may not be useful where the relationships between variables are nonlinear or complex. Under these circumstances, nonlinear methods, such as neural networks or decision trees can be used to develop reliable models, without necessarily giving any particular or explicit insight into the relationships between the process and the target variables. This is a major drawback in situations where such information would be very important, such as in fault identification or gaining a better {{understanding of}} the fundamentals of a process. In this paper, the use of variable importance measures and <b>partial</b> <b>dependency</b> plots generated by random forest models are proposed as a practical tool that can be used to surmount this problem. In particular, it is shown that important variables can be flagged by appropriate threshold generated by inclusion of dummy variables in the system.

CLEC- 2 {{has been shown}} to activate platelets using an ITAM-like sequence in its cytoplasmic tail that is also dependent on Src and Syk kinases, but shows a partial rather than an absolute dependence on adapter SLP- 76 for activation of PLC_y 2. The aim of this thesis is to understand some of the key differences in these signalling pathways. GPVI is in complex with FcRwhich contains the ITAM sequence (Yxx(L/I) x_ 6 - 12 Yxx(L/I)). These two tyrosines provide a docking site for the tandem-SH 2 domains of Syk. In this thesis I show that CLEC- 2 signalling through Syk is mediated by phosphorylation of the CLEC- 2 YxxL sequence, receptor dimerisation and cross-linking by the Syk SH 2 domains.
