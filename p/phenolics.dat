5|$|<b>Phenolics,</b> {{sometimes}} called phenols, consist of an aromatic 6-carbon ring bonded to a hydroxy group. Some phenols have antiseptic properties, while others disrupt endocrine activity. <b>Phenolics</b> range from simple tannins {{to the more}} complex flavonoids that give plants much of their red, blue, yellow, and white pigments. Complex <b>phenolics</b> called polyphenols are capable of producing {{many different types of}} effects on humans, including antioxidant properties. Some examples of <b>phenolics</b> used for defense in plants are: lignin, silymarin and cannabinoids. Condensed tannins, polymers composed of 2 to 50 (or more) flavonoid molecules, inhibit herbivore digestion by binding to consumed plant proteins and making them more difficult for animals to digest, and by interfering with protein absorption and digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|In {{tropical}} Sargassum and Turbinaria {{species that}} are often preferentially consumed by herbivorous fishes and echinoids, there is a relatively low level of <b>phenolics</b> and tannins.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{have evolved}} many {{secondary}} metabolites involved in plant defense, which are collectively known as antiherbivory compounds {{and can be}} classified into three sub-groups: nitrogen compounds (including alkaloids, cyanogenic glycosides, glucosinolates and benzoxazinoids), terpenoids, and <b>phenolics.</b>|$|E

30|$|Basing our {{experimental}} {{work on the}} hypotheses that (i) different <b>phenolic</b> compounds have different limits of toxicity on S. cerevisiae and (ii) mechanisms and activities of inhibition among <b>phenolic</b> compounds may be compound-specific, we have defined the toxicity limits of 13 different <b>phenolic</b> compounds selected from all classes of <b>phenolic</b> compounds commonly found in {{but not limited to}} spruce hydrolysates. We also studied the effects of the various <b>phenolic</b> compounds on the growth of S. cerevisiae and categorised the <b>phenolic</b> compounds into clusters based on their effects on growth. The influence of each cluster of <b>phenolic</b> compounds on metabolite yields were investigated in order to draw parallels and similarities between the <b>phenolic</b> compounds within each cluster and to explore whether compounds within each cluster have similar influence on the physiology of S. cerevisiae, all in order to better understand <b>phenolic</b> inhibition in lignocellulosic fermentation.|$|R

5|$|Soil {{nutrient}} deficiencies {{can cause}} a variety of plant problems that range from malformed plants {{to a lack of}} head growth. Many insects are attracted to lettuce, including cutworms, which cut seedlings off at the soil line; wireworms and nematodes, which cause yellow, stunted plants; tarnished plant bugs and aphids, which cause yellow, distorted leaves; leafhoppers, which cause stunted growth and pale leaves; thrips, which turn leaves gray-green or silver; leafminers, which create tunnels within the leaves; flea beetles, which cut small holes in leaves and caterpillars, slugs and snails, which cut large holes in leaves. Mammals, including rabbits and groundhogs, also eat the plants. Lettuce contains several defensive compounds, including sesquiterpene lactones, and other natural <b>phenolics</b> such as flavonol and glycosides, which help to protect it against pests. Certain varieties contain more than others, and some selective breeding and genetic modification studies have focused on using this trait to identify and produce commercial varieties with increased pest resistance.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{as well as}} {{qualitative}} {{changes of}} <b>phenolic</b> compounds were investigated in different decomposition stages (I-IV) of native alder leaf litter. The Folin-Ciocalteau method was applied for the determination of total <b>phenolic</b> compounds and the reserved phase HPLC for {{the determination of the}} <b>phenolic</b> acids. Both values decreased in dependence on stage of litter decomposition. The reduction of the total <b>phenolic</b> compounds and the <b>phenolic</b> acids was 20 % and 50 %, respectively, in the most decomposed litter (stage IV) in comparison with fresh litter (stage I, 100 %). The ratio of free (simple extracted) and bound <b>phenolic</b> compounds (extracted after acid hydrolysis) in the group of total <b>phenolic</b> compounds and <b>phenolic</b> acids was determined. The characteristic feature of the fresh litter (stage I) was higher amount of the free <b>phenolic</b> acids as well as higher ratio of the free <b>phenolic</b> compounds to the bound ones. The following stage II was characterised by two times higher portion of free to bound total <b>phenolic</b> compounds in contrary to <b>phenolic</b> acids where the bound acids dominat ed over the free ones. Higher level of bound to free compounds in both observed <b>phenolic</b> groups was typical for the most decomposed litter samples (stage III and IV). In addition, the stage III and IV were characterised by new compounds, which were formed in the litter during its decomposition and were not detectable in the previous stages (I,II) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} small <b>phenolic</b> {{compounds}} in pretreated stover on celluase activity is crucial {{but has not}} yet been fully elucidated. This work investigated the effects of both <b>phenolic</b> acid and <b>phenolic</b> aldehyde on cellulase activity. The model substances of small <b>phenolic</b> compounds identified in steam exploded corn stover were used to examine their individual effects on cellulase activity. It was found that <b>phenolic</b> aldehyde significantly inhibited cellulase activity at 0. 05 - 8 g/L.

Small <b>phenolic</b> compounds mixture might also have a concentration-dependent effect on cellulase activity: significant stimulation at 2 - 8 g/L and slight inhibition at 0. 05 - 1 g/L. The small <b>phenolic</b> compounds in pretreated stover were proven to be able to significantly stimulate enzymatic hydrolysis of stover. On the basis of these results, it is proposed that the concentration-dependent effects of small <b>phenolic</b> compounds on cellulase activity should be considered while removing them after pretreatment.

25|$|The {{ratio of}} sugars, acids and <b>phenolics</b> to {{water is a}} key {{determination}} of how well a wine can age. The less water in the grapes prior to harvest, the more likely the resulting wine will have some aging potential. Grape variety, climate, vintage and viticultural practice come into play here. Grape varieties with thicker skins, from a dry growing season where little irrigation was used and yields were kept low will have less water and a higher ratio of sugar, acids and <b>phenolics.</b> The process of making Eisweins, where water {{is removed from the}} grape during pressing as frozen ice crystals, has a similar effect of decreasing the amount of water and increasing aging potential.|$|E
40|$|<b>Phenolic</b> compounds, {{commonly}} found in woods hydrolysates and biorefinery side streams are products of lignin breakdown during wood pretreatment. They are formed alongside other products such as organic acids and furaldehydes. <b>Phenolic</b> compounds are widely varied and {{are known to be}} inhibitory to cell performance, thus making the efficient bioconversion of lignocellulose biomass to products such as bioethanol, a difficult task. As part of our aim at developing robust Saccharomyces cerevisiae for lignocellulosic fermentation, we have studied the interaction of S. cerevisiae cells with a selected subset of <b>phenolic</b> compounds. Three <b>phenolic</b> compounds; 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxycinnamaldehyde, 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid and 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid, were selected as representative <b>phenolic</b> compounds and model substrates. These substances represent <b>phenolic</b> aldehydes and acids thus providing an opportunity to closely compare different <b>phenolic</b> compound groups on the same –cinnamic- structural background, {{at the same time they}} offer a chance to probe the influence of side groups such as the methoxy group on the <b>phenolic</b> compound toxicity. Our studies show that when S. cerevisiae is exposed to the selected <b>phenolic</b> compounds, the cells carry out a process of detoxification that involves several conversion steps in transforming the toxic <b>phenolic</b> compounds to other <b>phenolic</b> compounds with much higher toxicity limits that confirm them to be less toxic. The toxicity limit here has been defined as the concentration at which S. cerevisiae performance in the presence of <b>phenolic</b> compounds is decreased to about 20 % in comparison to the control in Yeast minimal Mineral medium without <b>phenolic</b> compounds. Furthermore, products and observed patterns of the conversion indicate that S. cerevisiae likely employs a common conversion route for the different <b>phenolic</b> compounds...|$|R

To date, few studies have investigated the effect of various agricultural practices on levels of secondary metabolites in crops. The aim of this work was to determine the <b>phenolic</b> acid content in four winter wheat cultivars, grown using conventional and organic agricultural practices.

25|$|In {{white wine}} production, {{pressing}} usually takes place immediately after crushing or/and before primary fermentation. In red wine production, the grapes are also crushed but pressing usually doesn't take place till after {{or near the}} end of fermentation with the time of skin contact between the juice and grapes leaching color, tannins and other <b>phenolics</b> from the skin. Approximately 60-70% of the available juice within the grape berry, the free-run juice, can be released by the crushing process and doesn't require the use of the press. The remaining 30-40% that comes from pressing can have higher pH levels, lower titratable acidity, potentially higher volatile acidity and higher <b>phenolics</b> than the free-run juice depending on the amount of pressure and tearing of the skins and will produce more astringent, bitter wine.|$|E
25|$|Raw {{or fresh}} olives are {{naturally}} very bitter; {{to make them}} palatable, olives must be cured and fermented, thereby removing oleuropein, a bitter phenolic compound that can reach levels of 14% of dry matter in young olives. In addition to oleuropein, other phenolic compounds render freshly picked olives unpalatable and must also be removed or lowered in quantity through curing and fermentation. Generally speaking, <b>phenolics</b> reach their peak in young fruit and are converted as the fruit matures. Once ripening occurs, the levels of <b>phenolics</b> sharply decline through their conversion to other organic products which render some cultivars edible immediately.

25|$|In Beaujolais rosés {{are made}} from the Gamay grape using the same {{carbonic}} maceration techniques as the red wines except that the free-run juice that is released {{by the weight of}} the whole berry grapes in the tank is periodically drained off throughout the process to avoid extracting too much color and <b>phenolics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rosés can be {{produced}} {{in a variety of}} ways with the most common method being early pressing of red grape varieties after a very short period, usually 12–24 hours, of skin-contact (maceration). During maceration, <b>phenolics</b> such as the anthocyanins and tannins that contribute to color as well as many flavor components are leached from the skins, seeds and any stems left in contact with the must. In addition to adding color and flavor, these <b>phenolics</b> also serve as antioxidants, protecting the wine from degradation of oxygen exposure. While red wines will often have maceration last several days to even several weeks, the very limited maceration of rosés means that these wines will have less stable color, potential flavor components and oxygen protection. This contributes to wines with shorter shelf-life that are meant to be consumed soon after release.|$|E

40|$|A {{major concern}} {{regarding}} allelopathic interactions involving <b>phenolic</b> acids in no-till systems {{pertains to the}} fact that concentrations of individual <b>phenolic</b> acids recoverable from field soils are well below levels required for inhibition of germination and seedling growth in laboratory bioassays. Field soils contain a variety of <b>phenolic</b> acids as well as other toxic and nontoxic organic compounds that are available to interact with seeds and roots; whereas in laboratory bioassays, with few exceptions, single <b>phenolic</b> acids have been tested. Studies of mixtures of <b>phenolic</b> acids and other toxic (e. g., methionine) and nontoxic (e. g., glucose) organic compounds in laboratory bioassays indicate that the action of a single <b>phenolic</b> acid is not representative of the actions of such mixtures. Specifically, as the number of <b>phenolic</b> acids added to soil increased, concentrations of the individual <b>phenolic</b> acids required to bring about a growth inhibition declined. The addition of other organic compounds (e. g., glucose, methionine) to the soil also reduced the concentration of a <b>phenolic</b> acid (e. g., p-coumaric acid) required for growth inhibition.

Aims: To assess the <b>phenolic</b> composition and antioxidant properties of above- and under-ground parts of P. angulata at four growth stages and evaluate their potential as chemical quality indicators. Methods: A method of HPLC-DAD was used to assess the <b>phenolic</b> profiles. Anti-radical potential, total antioxidant capacity and iron reducing power were evaluated by spectrometric methods. Sample distinctiveness was determined by cluster analyses. Results: The HPLC-DAD analysis revealed 21 <b>phenolic</b> compounds, which were accumulated in a tissue- and age-specific manner. On the contrary, a clear distinctiveness between <b>phenolic</b> contents and antioxidant properties of samples was not observed. Mature flowers highlighted for its total <b>phenolic</b> content (6. 50 mg/g fresh tissue) and total antioxidant capacity (416. 1 µg/mL). Young leaves were outstanding for its flavonoid content (37. 86 µg/g fresh tissue) and reducing power (A 700 nm = 4. 04). Immature calyces were worthy for its <b>phenolic</b> acid concentration (1. 28 µg/g fresh tissue) and its free radical scavenging activity (EC 50 = 0. 12 mg/mL).
