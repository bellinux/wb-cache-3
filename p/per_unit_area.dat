5|$|Surface tension has the {{dimension}} of force per unit length, or of energy <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>area.</b> The two are equivalent, but when referring to energy per unit of area, {{it is common to}} use the term surface energy, which is a more general term {{in the sense that it}} applies also to solids.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} formulae for {{the energy}} and momentum of electromagnetic radiation can be re-expressed in terms of photon events. For example, the pressure of electromagnetic radiation on an object derives from the transfer of photon momentum per unit time and unit area to that object, since pressure is force <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> and force is the change in momentum per unit time.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} slope-dependent {{variation}} in critical mean bed shear stress for coarse grain motion, and evaluates stream power <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> bed <b>area</b> {{as an alternative}} threshold parameter. Explanations for observed slope dependency and existing approaches for predicting the critical stream power <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> bed <b>area</b> are reviewed. An analysis of secondary bed-load transport datasets is {{used to examine the}} strength of associations between stream power <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> bed <b>area,</b> mean bed shear stress and mean velocity, with bedload transport rate. Data from an original flume study are combined with secondary data from similar flume experiments to investigate the effect of slope on both critical stream power <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> bed <b>area</b> and critical mean bed shear stress. Results suggest that stream power <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> bed <b>area</b> is most closely correlated with bed-load transport rate, and also that critical stream power <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> bed <b>area</b> is less variable with slope than critical mean bed shear stress. Alternative solutions to approximating critical stream power are explored. These include: (1) modifying existing expressions for critical stream power to account for higher critical mean bed shear stresses at higher slopes, and (2) applying a constant dimensionless critical stream power criterion...|$|R

5|$|The Northeastern Pacific is {{the second}} most active basin and has the highest number of storms <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>area.</b> The {{hurricane}} season runs between May 15 and November 30 each year, and encompasses the vast majority of tropical cyclone activity in the region. In the 1971–2005 period, there were an average of 15–16 tropical storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4–5 major hurricanes (storms of Category 3 intensity or greater) annually in the basin.|$|E
5|$|The {{luminosity}} {{of a star}} is {{the amount}} of light and other forms of radiant energy it radiates per unit of time. It has units of power. The luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature. Many stars do not radiate uniformly across their entire surface. The rapidly rotating star Vega, for example, has a higher energy flux (power <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>area)</b> at its poles than along its equator.|$|E
5|$|India ranks first {{worldwide}} in farm output.

Yields <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> of all crops have grown since 1950, due to the special emphasis placed on agriculture in the five-year plans and steady improvements in irrigation, technology, application of modern agricultural practices and provision of agricultural credit and subsidies since the green revolution.|$|E

5|$|Impala are symbiotically {{related to}} oxpeckers, which feed on ticks from {{those parts of}} the antelope's body which the animal cannot access by itself (such as the ears, neck, eyelids, {{forehead}} and underbelly). The impala is the smallest ungulate with which oxpeckers are associated. In a study it was observed that oxpeckers selectively attended to impala despite the presence of other animals such as Coke's hartebeest, Grant's gazelle, Thompson's gazelle and topi. A possible explanation for this could be that because the impala inhabits woodlands (which can have a high density of ticks), the impala could have greater mass of ticks <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> of the body surface. Another study showed that the oxpeckers prefer the ears over other parts of the body, probably because these parts show maximum tick infestation.|$|E
5|$|The {{large amount}} of CO2 in the {{atmosphere}} together with water vapour and sulfur dioxide create a strong greenhouse effect, trapping solar energy and raising the surface temperature to around 740K (467°C), hotter than any other planet in the Solar System, even that of Mercury despite being located farther out from the Sun and receiving only 25% of the solar energy (<b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>area)</b> Mercury does. The average temperature on the surface is above the melting points of lead (600K, 327°C), tin (505K, 232°C), and zinc (693K, 420°C). The thick troposphere also makes the difference in temperature between {{the day and night}} side small, even though the slow retrograde rotation of the planet causes a single solar day to last 116.5 Earth days. The surface of Venus spends 58.3 days of darkness before the sun rises again behind the clouds.|$|E
5|$|Within the abyssal and hadal zones, {{the areas}} around {{submarine}} hydrothermal vents and cold seeps have {{by far the}} greatest biomass and biodiversity <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>area.</b> Fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids, these areas are often home to large and diverse communities of thermophilic, halophilic and other extremophilic prokaryotic microorganisms (such {{as those of the}} sulfide-oxidizing Beggiatoa genus), often arranged in large bacterial mats near cold seeps. In these locations, chemosynthetic archaea and bacteria typically form the base of the food chain. Although the process of chemosynthesis is entirely microbial, these chemosynthetic microorganisms often support vast ecosystems consisting of complex multicellular organisms through symbiosis. These communities are characterized by species such as vesicomyid clams, mytilid mussels, limpets, isopods, giant tube worms, soft corals, eelpouts, galatheid crabs, and alvinocarid shrimp. The deepest seep community discovered thus far is in the Japan Trench, at a depth of 7700meters.|$|E

Total weight and length of roots <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> land <b>area</b> increased with population density, but the proportional increases were much less than for shoot weight. Consequently the root:total weight ratio increased from 0. 3 in the densest stand to almost 0. 5 in the widely spaced crop. The denser stands produced a greater proportion of their roots at depth. In wide rows there was little change in rooting density across the inter-row space. Total dry matter <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> land <b>area</b> increased with population, although the weight per plant was less in denser stands.
