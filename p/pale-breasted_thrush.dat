50|$|The <b>pale-breasted</b> <b>thrush</b> (Turdus leucomelas) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Turdidae.|$|E
50|$|Other birds {{observed}} in the park include the rufous-tailed jacamar (Galbula ruficauda), squirrel cuckoo (Piaya cayana), southern beardless tyrannulet (Camptostoma obsoletum), purple-throated euphonia (Euphonia chlorotica), grey-headed tanager (Eucometis penicillata), barred antshrike (Thamnophilus doliatus), <b>pale-breasted</b> <b>thrush</b> (Turdus leucomelas), toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), white-throated spadebill (Platyrinchus mystaceus), sepia-capped flycatcher (Leptopogon amaurocephalus), silver-beaked tanager (Ramphocelus carbo), planalto tyrannulet (Phyllomyias fasciatus), bananaquit (Coereba flaveola) and red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus).|$|E
50|$|In {{appearance}} it {{is similar}} to the American robin in size and shape, but it lacks the red chest and is more uniformly brown. Its song and feeding habits are also very similar to its distant cousin. In most of its range, it {{is more likely to be}} confused with the creamy-bellied thrush. Unlike the creamy-bellied thrush, the <b>pale-breasted</b> <b>thrush</b> has a clear contrast between the head and mantle, and it lacks blackish lores.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the movement of}} seeds transported by fruit-eating birds in an agricultural, fragmented landscape of the Atlantic forest of southeast Brazil, I asked which bird species are the main seed dispersers in such environment, and how they use the available habitats (small forest fragments, forest thickets, live fences, isolated trees, and active pastures) where they {{are most likely to}} drop the seeds they swallow the relative importance of fruit-eating birds as seed vectors was evaluated {{based on the number of}} fruit species eaten, the number of visits, and visitation rate to fruiting plants. Habitat use was accessed by recording the habitats where birds were seen or heard during walks conducted throughout the study area. Sixteen plant species were observed during 308. 3 plant-hours. Forty-one bird species were observed eating fruits in a total of 830 visits to fruiting plants. Sayaca Tanagers (Thraupis sayaca) and <b>Pale-breasted</b> <b>Thrushes</b> (Turdus leucomelas) ate the greatest number of fruit species, were the most frequent plant visitors in terms of number and rate of visits, and had a broad range of habitat use. These two species and the Rusty-margined Guan (Penelope superciliaris), which is able to swallow large fruits with large seeds that smaller bird species cannot cat, likely have a great contribution to the movement of seeds throughout this highly degraded landscape...|$|R
50|$|The {{creamy-bellied thrush}} (Turdus amaurochalinus) is {{a species of}} bird in the family Turdidae. It occurs {{in a wide range}} of wooded {{habitats}} in a large part of central and eastern South America. It is generally common, even in human altered habitats such as gardens and parks. While the plumage varies from overall greyish to brownish, and the bill from dusky to yellow, adult creamy-breasted thrushes always have distinctive blackish lores. This separates it from other similar thrushes (e.g. the <b>pale-breasted</b> <b>thrush)</b> found in its range.|$|E
50|$|Given the fruit's {{attractive}} {{color and}} the conspicuous display at the branch-tips, this tree appears to be distributed by birds which eat the fruit and spread the seeds. Perching birds, namely tanagers (Thraupidae), thrushes (Turdidae) and tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae), are most commonly seen to feed on the fruit. Some birds, such as the silver-beaked tanager (Ramphocelus carbo), prune off the seedcoat and eat it, discarding the seed, but most swallow the entire fruit. Species such as the swallow tanager (Tersina viridis) and the <b>pale-breasted</b> <b>thrush</b> (Turdus leucomelas), but perhaps most of all the sayaca tanager (Thraupis sayaca), appear to be particularly fond of them. Indeed, the sayaca tanager will defend richly fruiting A. glandulosa trees against similar-sized birds such as the blue dacnis (Dacnis cayana) or the red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus). It may be that at least locally, T. sayaca is crucial for the tree's reproduction and survival.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pale-breasted</b> <b>Thrush</b> (Turdus leucomelas) is {{described}} as an omnivorous bird that forage solitarily or in pairs on the soil. This note reports a rodent predation event by T. leucomelas. The event was recorded on November 14 th 2013, in a riparian Forest fragment of Grande River, in Igarapava Municipality, São Paulo, Brazil. Although the presence of small vertebrates on the diet of T. leucomelas is known, {{this is the first}} record of a mammal being predated by this bird species. This record is important because it contributes to a better understand of the natural history of Neotropical passerines...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the present}} study was to report and {{describe}} Isospora albicollis Lainson and Shaw, 1989 parasitizing a white-necked thrush Turdus albicollis Vieillot, 1818 and a <b>pale-breasted</b> <b>thrush</b> Turdus leucomelas Vieillot, 1818 in two different localities: the Itatiaia National Park and Cacaria, in southeastern Brazil. The oocysts identified were ovoidal, 24. 4 × 19. 7 μm, with a smooth, bilayered wall, around 1. 4 μm thick. Oocyst residuum was absent, but a micropyle and a polar granule were present. The sporocysts were ellipsoidal, 15. 4 × 10. 1 μm. The Stieda body was knob-like to rounded and the sub-Stieda body was prominent and wide. Sporocyst residuum was present, usually as a cluster of granules that appear to be membrane-bounded. The sporozoites were vermiform with one posterior refractile body and a centrally located nucleus. Besides recording the new host T. leucomelas, the identification of I. albicollis in the Itatiaia National Park and Cacaria, in southeastern Brazil, provide records of new localities for its parasitism, and reveals the wide distribution and dispersion of this coccidium in Brazil...|$|E
