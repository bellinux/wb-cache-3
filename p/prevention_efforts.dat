5|$|Suicide is {{the act of}} {{intentionally}} causing one's own death. Risk {{factors include}} mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, and substance abuse, including alcoholism and use of benzodiazepines. Other suicides are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide <b>prevention</b> <b>efforts</b> include limiting access to methods of suicide, such as firearms, drugs, and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, {{there is little evidence}} for their effectiveness.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} health savings accounts (HSAs) on optimal savings, insurance demand and <b>prevention</b> <b>effort</b> {{over the course of}} a lifetime. This paper adds to the literature by investigating HSAs as both a form of insurance and as saving vehicle in an expected utility framework. Assuming no regulatory constraints on the deductible, we show that individuals voluntarily choose a positive deductible and increase their savings with HSAs. If the government-imposed minimum deductible becomes too great, however, individuals may instead choose to remain in traditional insurance. We determine the effect of HSAs on <b>prevention</b> <b>effort.</b> We find that an increased tax subsidy may worsen moral hazard issues. Assuming partial risk aversion to be less than or equal to one, individuals will either invest less in the health preservation effort and more money in the HSA or vice versa. However, they will never increase both effort and savings simultaneously as was intended when HSAs were introduced.

40|$|Abstract:We {{develop a}} model where a free genetic test reveals whether the {{individual}} tested {{has a low}} or high probability of developing a disease. A costly <b>prevention</b> <b>effort</b> allows high-risk agents to decrease the probability of developing the disease. Agents are not obliged to take the test, but must disclose its results to insurers. Insurers offer separating contracts which {{take into account the}} individual risk, so that taking the test is associated to a discrimination risk. We study the individual decisions to take the test and to undertake the <b>prevention</b> <b>effort</b> {{as a function of the}} effort cost and of its efficiency. We obtain that, if effort is observable by insurers, agents undertake the test only if the effort cost is neither too large nor too low. If the effort cost is not observable by insurers, they face a moral hazard problem which induces them to under-provide insurance. We obtain the counter intuitive result that moral hazard increases the value of the test if the effort cost is low enough. Also, agents may perform the test for lower levels of <b>prevention</b> efficiency when <b>effort</b> is not observable. discrimination risk, informational value of test, personalized medecine. ...|$|R

25|$|The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP), {{based in}} {{suburban}} Philadelphia, {{is a nonprofit}} organization devoted to preventing medication errors and the safe use of medications. Its medication error <b>prevention</b> <b>efforts</b> began in 1975 with a column in Hospital Pharmacy to inform healthcare professionals and others about medication error prevention. ISMP operates a voluntary practitioner error-reporting program to tabulate errors nationally, understand their causes, and share “lessons learned” with the healthcare community, known as the Medication Errors Reporting Program (MERP), operated by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) in cooperation with ISMP. In addition, ISMP’s corporate subsidiary, Med-E.R.R.S. (Medical Error Recognition and Revision Strategies), works directly and confidentially with the pharmaceutical industry to prevent errors that stem from confusing or misleading naming, labeling, packaging, and device design. The ISMP list of error-prone abbreviations is distributed nationally.|$|E
25|$|As raids {{occur to}} brothels that may house sex workers {{as well as}} sex trafficked victims, raids affect sex workers in general. As clients avoid brothel areas that are raided but do not stop paying for sex, {{voluntary}} sex workers will have to interact with customers underground. Underground interactions means that sex workers take greater risks, where as otherwise they would be cooperating with other sex workers and with sex worker organizations to report violence and protect each other. One {{example of this is}} with HIV prevention. Sex workers collectives monitor condom use, promote HIV testing, and cares for and monitor the health of HIV positive sex workers. Raids disrupt communal HIV care and <b>prevention</b> <b>efforts,</b> and if HIV positive sex workers are rescued and removed from their community, their treatments are disrupted, furthering the spread of AIDS.|$|E

By then, the structure had developed leaks and displayed cracks along the foundation, walls and ceiling. In 2006, a falling tree caused stones to break away, damaging the house's main gas line. The couple spent $200,000 over four years to reinforce the walls. Lynne and Hefferin also constructed exterior stairs and an underground retaining wall. However, the renovation process was not completed, as they were unable to pay for all repairs required by the city, which had issued $20,000 in fines on the property. The couple also struggled to pay for costly landslide <b>prevention</b> <b>efforts,</b> rising property taxes and high heating bills. Canterbury Castle was listed for sale in the summer of 2008 for $2million. Lynne invited local interior design students and contractors to upgrade the house's interior, without success. The couple left the house in January 2009, and ownership was turned over to JPMorgan Chase. Lynne began a [...] "one-woman crusade" [...] to save the castle, seeking assistance from Portland City Commissioner Randy Leonard and from home improvement expert and This Old House host Bob Vila. In February 2009, the city's bureau of development services found that unstable soil and the risk of stones separating from sheeting underneath posed a landslide risk. The property had missing stones and thick cracks several feet long, which presented hazards to residents and the street below. Rumors of demolition began to surface in March 2009.|$|E

The primary objective was to examine and to find out how the local communities are involved in drug abuse prevention, their community strategies or initiatives in drug abuse control and to find out why drug abuse persists despite the measures taken by the government to control drug abuse in the country. The study findings revealed that, the local have not yet involved in the prevention of drug abuse among youth in the country from the local community level to national legislation and institutions. Most of drug abuse <b>prevention</b> <b>effort</b> has been done by the government and non government organization. The existing policies and legislations also do not recognize the role of local communities in fighting drug abuse among the community and the nation at large. The local communities lack or have inadequate resources and not well informed about the drug abuse and its impact on the community. The main factor that leads youth to engage in drug abuse has been the lack of employment and peer group pressure. Apart from that, the study shows that people believe that participations and involvement of communities in the <b>prevention</b> <b>effort</b> will help reduce the problem and its impact among the youth. Many respondents shown concern that, the government is not doing enough effort to prevent drug abuse in the country since there many loopholes for drug traffickers and dealers to conduct this business in the country.
