Impelled by the combination of Misfortunes under which I laboured, namely Fear, Cold and Hunger I hesitated not to ask admittance which at length I have gained; and now my Adorable Laura (continued he taking my Hand) when may I hope to receive that reward of all the <b>painfull</b> sufferings I have undergone {{during the course of}} my attachment to you, to which I have ever aspired.

60|$|This seems {{also to be}} {{the reason}} why bathing in Mineral waters are such soveraign {{remedies}} for multitudes of distempers, especially chronical; for the liquid & warm vehicles of the Mineral particles, which {{are known to be}} in very considerable quantities in those healing baths, by the body's long stay in them, do by degrees steep and insinuate themselves into the pores and parts of the skin, and thereby those Mineral particles have their ways and passages open'd to penetrate into the inner parts, and mingle themselves with the stagnant juices of the several parts; besides, many of those offensive parts which were united with those stagnant juices, and which were contrary to the natural constitution of the parts, and so become irksome and <b>painfull</b> to the body, but could not be discharged, because Nature had made no provision for such accidental mischiefs, are, by means of this soaking, and filling the pores of the skin with a liquor, afforded a passage through that liquor that fills the pores into the ambient fluid, and thereby the body comes to be discharged.|$|E

Belfast untied himself with blind impetuosity, and all at once shot down to leeward quicker than a flash of lightning. We shouted all together with dismay; but with his legs overboard he held and yelled for a rope. In our extremity nothing could be terrible; so we judged him funny kicking there, and with his scared face. Some one began to laugh, and, as if hysterically infected with screaming merriment, all those haggard men went off laughing, wild-eyed, like a lot of maniacs tied up on a wall. Mr. Baker swung off the binnacle-stand and tendered him one leg. He scrambled up rather scared, and consigning us with abominable words to the [...] "divvle." [...] "You are.... Ough! You're a foul-mouthed beggar, Craik," [...] grunted Mr. Baker. He answered, stuttering with indignation:--"Look at 'em, sorr. The bloomin dirty images! laughing at a chum going overboard. Call themselves men, too." [...] But from the break of the poop the boatswain called out:--"Come along," [...] and Belfast crawled away in a hurry to join him. The five men, poised and gazing {{over the edge of the}} poop, looked for the best way to get forward. They seemed to hesitate. The others, twisting in their lashings, turning <b>painfull,</b> stared with open lips. Captain Allistoun saw nothing; he seemed with his eyes to hold the ship up in a superhuman concentration of effort. The wind screamed loud in sunshine; columns of spray rose straight up; and in the glitter of rainbows bursting over the trembling hull the men went over cautiously, disappearing from sight with deliberate movements.|$|E
60|$|The {{consideration}} of which very pretty structure, has hinted to me, that certainly {{the use of}} these claws seems to be very considerable, as to the main end of this Instrument, for the drawing in, and holding the sting in the flesh; for the point being very sharp, the top of the Sting or Dagger (ab) is very easily thrust into an Animal's body, which being once entred, the Bee, by endeavouring to pull it into the sheath, draws (by reason of the crooks (vxy) and (xyzz) which lay hold of the skin on either side) the top of the sheath (tsrv) into the skin after it, and the crooks t, s, and r, v, being entred, when the Bee endeavours to thrust out the top of the sting out of the sheath again, they lay hold of the skin on either side, and do not onely keep the sheath from sliding back, but helps the top inwards, and thus, by an alternate and successive retracting and emitting of the Sting {{in and out of the}} sheath, the little enraged creature by degrees makes his revengfull weapon pierce the toughest and thickest Hides of his enemies, in so much that some few of these stout and resolute soldiers with these little engines, do often put to flight a huge masty Bear, one of their deadly enemies, and thereby shew the world how much more considerable in Warr a few skilfull Engineers and resolute soldiers politickly order'd, that know how to manage such engines, are, then a vast unweildy rude force, that confides in, and acts onely by, its strength. But (to proceed) that he thus gets in his Sting into the skin, I conjecture, because, when I have observ'd this creature living, I have found it to move the Sting thus, to and fro, and thereby also, perhaps, does, as 'twere, pump or force out the poisonous liquor, and make it hang at the end of the sheath about b in a drop. The crooks, I suppose also to be the cause why these angry creatures, hastily removing themselves from their revenge, do often leave these weapons behind them, sheath'd, as 'twere, in the flesh, and, by that means, cause the <b>painfull</b> symptoms to be greater, and more lasting, which are very probably caus'd, partly by the piercing and tearing of the skin by the Sting, but chiefly by the corrosive and poisonous liquor that is by this Syringe-pipe convey'd among the sensitive parts thereof and thereby more easily gnaws and corrodes those tender fibres: As I have shewed in the description of a Nettle and of Cowhage.|$|E

60|$|He, therefore, first {{requesting}} Mr Pancks {{to remember}} his voluntary declaration that his proprietor had {{no part in}} the disclosure, and that his own intentions were good (two declarations which that coaly little gentleman with the greatest ardour repeated), openly told him that as to the Dorrit lineage or former place of habitation, he had no information to communicate, and that {{his knowledge of the}} family did not extend beyond the fact that it appeared to be now reduced to five members; namely, to two brothers, of whom one was single, and one a widower with three children. The ages of the whole family he made known to Mr Pancks, as nearly as he could guess at them; and finally he described to him the position of the Father of the Marshalsea, and the course of time and events through which he had become invested with that character. To all this, Mr Pancks, snorting and blowing in a more and more portentous manner as he became more interested, listened with great attention; appearing to derive the most agreeable sensations from the <b>painfullest</b> parts of the narrative, and particularly to be quite charmed by the account of William Dorrit's long imprisonment.|$|R

6000|$|History, however, {{in dealing}} with this Reign of Terror, has had her own difficulties. While the Phenomenon {{continued}} in its primary state, as mere 'Horrors of the French Revolution,' there was abundance to be said and shrieked. With and also without profit.

And now, in a new stage of the business, when History, ceasing to shriek, would try rather to include under her old Forms of speech or speculation this new amazing Thing; that so some accredited scientific Law of Nature might suffice for the unexpected Product of Nature, and History might get to speak of it articulately, and draw inferences and profit from it; in this new stage, History, we must say, babbles and flounders perhaps in a still <b>painfuller</b> manner. Take, for example, the latest Form of speech we have seen propounded on the subject as adequate to it, almost in these months, by our worthy M. Roux, in his Histoire Parlementaire. The latest and the strangest: that the French Revolution was a dead-lift effort, after eighteen hundred years of preparation, to realise--the Christian Religion! (Hist. Parl. Introd., i. 1 et seqq.) Unity, Indivisibility, Brotherhood or Death did indeed stand printed on all Houses of the Living; also, on Cemeteries, or Houses of the Dead, stood printed, by order of Procureur Chaumette, Here is eternal Sleep: (Deux Amis, xii. 78.) but a Christian Religion realised by the Guillotine and Death-Eternal, 'is suspect to me,' as Robespierre was wont to say, 'm'est suspecte.' ...|$|R

5000|$|Andrews was {{the author}} of a poem called the ‘Anatomie of Basenesse’ (1615), which was reprinted in the ‘Miscellanies of the Fuller Worthies' Library’ (vol. ii.). The ‘Anatomie’ was {{published}} with only the initials I. A. in the epistle dedicatory to Sir Robert Sydney, but this epistle guides to the authorship. Apologising for his dedication, the writer says, among other things, that he prints not ‘vaine-gloriously,’ or he would have ‘subscribed his name,’ and that he forbore to have his name published ‘out of some respects.’ The ‘some respects’ probably refer to his being a minister of the Gospel; he seems to have held that his satire was too drastic and vehement for a clergyman, and might lay him open to misconstruction. Anthony à Wood in his ‘Athenæ,’ and his editor Dr. Bliss, filled in the initials thus—‘Iohn Andrews’—and wrote of him: ‘John Andrews, a Somersetshire man born, was entered a student in Trinity College 1601, aged 18, took one degree in arts M.A., Fasti Oxon., left the university, became a <b>painfull</b> preacher of God's word, and a publisher of’ certain books. … ‘When he died, or where he was buried, I know not.’ ...|$|E
50|$|After being privately educated {{he became}} an architect, and was for many years {{surveyor}} and architect to the Ironmongers' Company. French was an accomplished scholar, and devoted his leisure to antiquarian researches. He was long {{an active member of}} the council, and subsequently one of the vice-presidents, of the London and Middlesex Archæological Society. In 1841 French published an elaborate account of the ancestries of Queen Victoria and of the Prince Consort; and in 1847 his Address delivered on the sixth anniversary of the College of the Freemasons of the Church. He next traced the royal descent of Nelson and Wellington from Edward I, king of England, and published in 1853 the tables of pedigree and genealogical memoirs in connection therewith. In 1861-9 he prepared and issued a Catalogue of the Antiquities and Works of Art exhibited at Ironmongers' Hall. French published in two parts the result of a careful series of Shakespearean investigations, under the title of Shakespeareana Genealogica (1869). The first part consisted of an identification of the dramatis personae in Shakespeare's historical plays, from King John to Henry VIII, accompanied with observations on characters in Macbeth and Hamlet, and notes on persons and places belonging to Warwickshire alluded to in several plays. The second part consisted of a dissertation on the Shakespeare and Arden families and their connections, with tables of descent. French, who was a temperance reformer, published in 1879 a work entitled Temperance or Abstinence, in which he discussed the question from the scriptural point of view. French died in London on 14 October 1881 after a long and <b>painfull</b> illness, and was interred at the Willesden Cemetery.|$|E
