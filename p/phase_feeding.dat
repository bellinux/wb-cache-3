For these reasons, <b>phase</b> <b>feeding</b> {{had been introduced}} in swine farm for improving animal production. This experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary energy levels and <b>phase</b> <b>feeding</b> by protein levels on growth performance, blood profiles and carcass characteristics in growing-finishing pigs. Methods A total of 128 growing pigs ([Yorkshire[*]×[*]Landrace][*]×[*]Duroc), averaging 26. 62 [*]±[*] 3. 07  kg body weight, were assigned in a 2 [*]×[*] 4 factorial arrangement with 4 pigs per pen. The first factor was two dietary energy level (3, 265  kcal of ME/kg or 3, 365  kcal of ME/kg), and the second factor was four different levels of dietary protein by <b>phase</b> <b>feeding</b> (1 growing(G) - 2 finishing(F) phases, 2 G- 2 F phases, 2 G- 3 F phases and 2 G- 3 F phases with low CP requirement). Results In feeding trial, {{there was no significant}} difference in growth performance. The BUN concentration was decreased as dietary protein level decreased in 6  week and blood creatinine was increased in 13  week when pigs were fed diets with different dietary energy level. The digestibility of crude fat was improved as dietary energy levels increased and excretion of urinary nitrogen was reduced when low protein diet was provided. Chemical compositions of longissimus muscle were not affected by dietary treatments. In backfat thickness (P 2) at 13  week, pigs fed high energy diet had thicker backfat thickness (P[*]=[*] 0. 06) and pigs fed low protein diet showed the trend of backfat thinness reduction (P[*]=[*] 0. 09). In addition, water holding capacity was decreased (P[*]=[*] 0. 01) and cooking loss was increased (P[*]=[*] 0. 07) as dietary protein level reduced. When pigs were fed high energy diet with low subdivision of <b>phase</b> <b>feeding,</b> days to 120  kg market weight was reached earlier compared to other treatments. Conclusion Feeding the low energy diet and subdivision of growing-finishing phase by dietary protein levels had no significant effect on growth performance and carcass characteristics.

40|$|Research of {{chromium}} (VI) separation {{has been}} done using polymer inclusion membrane (PIM) method. This study aims to generate PIM, separate the metal ion chromium (VI) using PIM and {{determine the effect of}} the concentration of the <b>feed</b> <b>phase,</b> the thickness of the membrane and the amount of usage of the membrane for ion chromium (VI) diffusion. Polymer inclusion membrane (PIM) was made by mixing Aliquat 336 -TBP as carrier compounds, PVC as the base polymer, DBE as a plasticizer and THF as a solvent. PIM membrane was placed between the source of analyte as a <b>feed</b> <b>phase</b> and result of the separation as a receiver <b>phase.</b> <b>Feed</b> <b>phase</b> was electroplating waste metal containing chromium (VI) at pH 4, while the receiver phase was a 2 N NaCl solution with a pH 6. 7. The change of variables in this study were the concentration of the <b>feed</b> <b>phase</b> at various dilution i. e., 100 x, 50 x and 10 x, the thickness of the membrane i. e., 25 μm, 20 μm and 10 μm, and the time of membrane using i. e., 1, 2 and 3 times. The concentration of chromium (VI) diffused after separation process was analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The stability of membrane was observed by analyzing the presence of membrane’s component in the <b>feed</b> <b>phase</b> and in the receiver phase. The analysis was conducted by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Meanwhile, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was used to determine the morphology of membrane surface. The results showed that the chromium ion concentration diffused from the <b>feed</b> <b>phase</b> was 99. 24 %, meanwhile the 85. 88 % of it diffused to the receiving phase.

The least cost ration included optimal amounts of nutrients (protein, lysine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, and phosphorus) which were derived from these ingredients: corn, soybean meal, synthetic amino acids (lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan), and di-calcium phosphorus. A methodology for evaluating the use of enzyme phytase to reduce phosphorus excretion was developed. ^ Profits were represented as daily returns to management and operator labor for a feeder pig finishing producer. An evaluation procedure was conducted to help validate the growth relationships and the model 2 ̆ 7 s performance. The model incorporated an innovative method using the concept of transitional growth for modeling <b>phase</b> <b>feeding</b> within the live weight production function.

Pigs fed using <b>phase</b> <b>feeding</b> of the ground corn-supplement blend had greater (P 0. 28) statistical differences in total revenue and income over feed costs (IOFC) across treatments. However, the highest IOFC was obtained from diet blending, which had a numeric advantage of $ 1. 44 to $ 2. 32 /pig over other treatments. In conclusion, the FeedPro system blended separate complete diets and a ground corn-supplement combination without adversely affecting growth performance and carcass characteristics...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} obtain information {{on the concept of}} progres-sively decreasing dietary phosphorus levels (<b>phase</b> <b>feeding)</b> on the performance of three different commercial layer strains. Dietary available phosphorus (AP) levels of. 15,. 30, or. 45 % were fed continuously from 22 to 70 weeks of age. Concurrently, a diet containing. 35,. 25, and. 15 % AP was phase-fed during age intervals of 22 to 34, 34 to 50, and 50 to 70 weeks, respectively. Dietary AP levels did not significantly affect egg production except the. 15 % AP level, which significantly reduced egg production when compared with the other three dietary AP treatments. Efficiency of feed utilization was significantly superior for hens phase-fed AP compared with hens fed the other AP treatments. There were no differences in egg weight or mortality due to dietary AP. Eggshells were significantly thicker when hens received. 15 % AP. The. 15 % AP and phase-fed regimen resulted in hens with significantly lower body weights {{at the end of the}} experi-ment. Hens fed. 30 % AP and phase-fed AP had significantly lower carcass ash and phosphorus levels. Serum phosphorus levels corresponded directly to dietary AP levels. There were no significant differences in egg production due to strain nor were there any strain by dietary treatment interactions that influenced production traits. Significant strain differences were noted in feed efficiency, egg weight, carcass ash, and carcass phosphorus.

40|$|A novel disphase {{supplying}} supported {{liquid membrane}} (DSSLM), containing supplying <b>feed</b> <b>phase</b> and supplying stripping phase for transport behavior of Ni(II), have been studied. The supplying supported <b>feed</b> <b>phase</b> included <b>feed</b> solution and di(2 -ethyhexyl) phosphoric acid (HDEHP) as the carrier in kerosene, and supplying stripping phase included HDEHP as the carrier in kerosene and HCl as the stripping agent. The effects of volume ratio of membrane solution to feed solution (O/F), pH, initial concentration of Ni(II) and ionic {{strength in the}} feed solution, volume ratio of membrane solution to stripping solution (O/S), concentration of H 2 SO 4 solution, HDEHP concentration in the supplying stripping phase on transport of Ni(II), the advantages of DSSLM compared to the traditional supported liquid membrane (SLM), the system stability, the reuse of membrane solution and the retention of membrane phase were studied. Experimental {{results indicated that the}} optimum transport of Ni(II) was obtained when H 2 SO 4 concentration was 2. 00 mol. L- 1, HDEHP concentration was 0. 120 mol. L- 1, and O/S was 4 : 1 in the supplying stripping phase, O/F was 1 : 10 and pH was 5. 20 in the supplying <b>feed</b> <b>phase.</b> The ionic strength in supplying <b>feed</b> <b>phase</b> had no obvious effect on transport of Ni(II). When initial Ni(II) concentration was 2. 00 x 10 (- 4) mol/L, the transport percentage of Ni(II) was up to 93. 1 % in 250 min. The kinetic equation was deduced in terms of the law of mass diffusion and the interface chemistry...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{alternative}} approach is described that is suited for longer wavelength SARs in particular, employing a large, deployable reflector antenna and a much simpler <b>phased</b> array <b>feed.</b> To illuminate a wide swath, a substantial fraction of the <b>phased</b> array <b>feed</b> is excited on transmit to sub-illuminate the reflector. Shorter transmit pulses are required than for conventional SAR. On receive, a much smaller portion of the <b>phased</b> array <b>feed</b> is used to collect the return echo, so that a greater portion of the reflector antenna area is used. The locus of {{the portion of the}} phased array used on receive is adjusted using an analog beam steering network, to 'sweep' the receive beam(s) across the illuminated swath, tracking the return echo. This is similar in some respects to the whiskbroom approach to optical sensors, hence the name: SweepSAR. SweepSAR has advantages over conventional SAR in that it requires less transmit power, and if the receive beam is narrow enough, it is relatively immune to range ambiguities. Compared to direct radiating arrays with digital beam- forming, it is much simpler to implement, uses currently available technologies, is better suited for longer wavelength systems, and does not require extremely high data rates or onboard processing...|$|R
