The first exports to Australia were in 1902 or 1903, with the Large Black being chosen over the Berkshire pig because {{of their ability to}} thrive in hot weather, their foraging abilities and their fecundity. By 1930, Large Blacks represented only 1 percent of Australia <b>pig</b> <b>population,</b> and were raised mainly by breeders in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The breed population continued to hover around 1 percent of the total population, with a slight increase after World War II and a decrease to almost zero new registrations in the 1980s. The first exports to the US were in the 1920s, but the population in that country dwindled to the point where imports were again necessary in 1985. Today, small herds {{can be found in the}} US that descend from the pigs imported in 1985 and 1990, and there are also herds in Canada, Australia, and South Africa.|$|E
25|$|The wild pig (Sus scrofa) {{can take}} {{advantage}} of any forage resources. Therefore, it can live in virtually any productive habitat that can provide enough water to sustain large mammals such as pigs. If there is increased foraging of wild pigs in certain areas, it can cause a nutritional shortage which can cause the <b>pig</b> <b>population</b> to decrease. If the nutritional state returns to normal, the <b>pig</b> <b>population</b> will most likely rise due to the pigs' naturally increased reproduction rate.|$|E

In 2011, Sichuan province had 51 million pigs (11% of China’s total supply). In rural western China, sheep, goats, and camels are raised by nomadic herders. In Tibet, yaks are raised {{as a source of}} food, fuel, and shelter. Cattle, water buffalo, horses, mules, and donkeys are also raised in China, and dairy has recently been encouraged by the government, even though approximately 92.3% of the adult population is affected by some level of lactose intolerance.|$|E

The most serious case of foot-and-mouth outbreak in South Korea's history started in November 2010 in pig farms in Andong city of Gyeongsangbuk-do, and has since spread in the country rapidly. More than 100 cases of the disease have been confirmed in the country so far, and in January 2011, South Korean officials started a mass cull of approximately 12%, or around three million in total, of the entire domestic <b>pig</b> <b>population,</b> and 107,000 of three million cattle {{of the country to}} halt the outbreak.|$|E
25|$|Up to 2,000 feral cats can in {{some years}} {{be found on the}} island; the {{population}} became established in the 19th century. Their depredations seriously harm the birdlife. Since the late 19th century, they have driven about 60% of the seabird species from the mainland completely, and during particular dry spells they will cross the mudflats and feast upon the birds on the motus. Spectacled tern chicks seem to be a favorite food of the local cat population. There are some measures being taken to ensure the cat population does not grow. That lowering the cat population by some amount would much benefit Christmas and its inhabitants is generally accepted, but the situation is too complex to simply go and eradicate them outright (which is theoretically possible; see Marion Island) – see below for details. A limited population of feral pigs exists. They were once plentiful and wreaked havoc especially on the Onychoprion and noddies. Pig hunting by locals has been encouraged, and was highly successful at limiting the <b>pig</b> <b>population</b> to a sustainable level, while providing a source of cheap protein for the islanders.|$|E
500|$|In 1954 {{there were}} 2195 Large Black pigs recorded, 269 {{licensed}} boars and 1926 registered sows, representing approximately 3.4% of the UK <b>pig</b> <b>population</b> of about 65,000. At {{the end of}} 2011 there were 421 Large Black pigs (86 boars and 335 sows) registered, a small increase over the 2010 figure of 405 (65 boars, 340 sows). The Large Black is the rarest historic pig breed in Britain, although numbers are slowly on the rise due {{to an increase in}} demand for meat from traditional pig breeds. In 2011 it was classified as [...] "vulnerable" [...] on the watchlist of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, meaning that there are believed to be between 200 and 300 breeding females.

40|$|Naturally endemic {{infectious}} diseases provide selective pressures for <b>pig</b> <b>populations.</b> Toll-like receptors (TLRs) represent {{the first line}} of immune defense against pathogens and are likely to play a crucial adaptive role for <b>pig</b> <b>populations.</b> This study was done to determine whether wild and domestic <b>pig</b> <b>populations</b> representing diverse global environments demonstrate local TLR adaptation. The genomic sequence encoding the ectodomain, responsible for interacting with pathogen ligands of bacterial (TLR 1, TLR 2 and TLR 6) and viral (TLR 3, TLR 7 and TLR 8) receptors, was obtained. Mitochondrial D-loop region sequences were obtained and a phylogenetic analysis using these sequences revealed a clear separation of animals into Asian (n = 27) and European (n = 40) clades. The TLR sequences were then analyzed for population-specific positive selection signatures within wild boars and domesticated <b>pig</b> <b>populations</b> derived from Asian and European clades. Using within-population and between-population tests for positive selection, a TLR 2 -derived variant 376 A (126 Thr), estimated to have arisen in 163, 000 years ago with a frequency of 83. 33 % within European wild boars, 98. 00 % within domestic pig breeds of European origin, 40. 00 % within Asian wild boars, and 11. 36 % within Asian domestic pigs, was identified to be under positive selection in pigs of European origin. The variant is located within the N terminal domain of the TLR 2 protein 3 D crystal structure and could affect ligand binding. This study suggests the TLR 2 gene contributing to responses to bacterial pathogens has been crucial in adaptation of pigs to pathogens. </p...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of {{the extent}} and range of linkage disequilibrium (LD), defined as non-random {{association}} of alleles at two or more loci, in animal populations is extremely valuable in localizing genes affecting quantitative traits, identifying chromosomal regions under selection, studying population history, and characterizing/managing genetic resources and diversity. Two commonly used LD measures, r 2 and D', and their permutation based adjustments, were evaluated using genotypes of more than 6, 000 pigs from six commercial lines (two terminal sire lines and four maternal lines) at &# 126; 4, 500 autosomal SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms). The results indicated that permutation only partially removed the dependency of D' on allele frequency and that r 2 is a considerably more robust LD measure. The maximum r 2 was derived {{as a function of}} allele frequency. Using the same genotype dataset, the extent of LD in these <b>pig</b> <b>populations</b> was estimated for all possible syntenic SNP pairs using r 2 and the ratio of r 2 over its theoretical maximum. As expected, the extent of LD highest for SNP pairs was found in tightest linkage and decreased as their map distance increased. The level of LD found in these <b>pig</b> <b>populations</b> appears to be lower than previously implied in several other studies using microsatellite genotype data. For all pairs of SNPs approximately 3 centiMorgan (cM) apart, the average r 2 was equal to 0. 1.

40|$|Background Inbreeding {{is among}} the major {{concerns}} in management of local livestock populations. The effective population size of these populations tends to be small, which enhances the risk of fitness reduction and extinction. High-density SNP data {{make it possible to}} undertake novel approaches in conservation genetics of endangered breeds and wild populations. A total of 97 representative samples of domestic and wild <b>pig</b> <b>populations</b> from the Iberian Peninsula, subjected to different levels of threat with extinction, were genotyped with a 60 K SNP panel. Data analyses based on: (i) allele frequency differences; (ii) linkage disequilibrium and (iii) runs of homozygosity were integrated to study population relationships, inbreeding and demographic history. Results The domestic pigs analyzed belonged to local Spanish and Portuguese breeds: Iberian - including the variants Retinto Iberian, Negro Iberian and Manchado de Jabugo -, Bisaro and Chato Murciano. The population structure and persistence of phase analysis suggested high genetic relations between Iberian variants, with recent crossbreeding of Manchado de Jabugo with other <b>pig</b> <b>populations.</b> Chato Murciano showed a high frequency of long runs of homozygosity indicating recent inbreeding and reflecting the recent bottleneck reported by historical records. The Chato Murciano and the Manchado de Jabugo breeds presented the lowest effective population sizes in accordance with their status of highly inbred breeds. The Iberian wild boar presented a high frequency of short runs of homozygosity indicating past small population size but no signs of recent inbreeding. The Iberian breed showed higher genetic similarities with Iberian wild boar than the other domestic breeds. Conclusions High-density SNP data provided a consistent overview of population structure, demographic history and inbreeding of minority breeds and wild <b>pig</b> <b>populations</b> from the Iberian Peninsula. Despite the very different background of the populations used, we found a good agreement between the different analyses. Our results are also in agreement with historical reports and provide insight in the events that shaped the current genetic variation of <b>pig</b> <b>populations</b> from the Iberian Peninsula.
