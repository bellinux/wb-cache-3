40|$|Abstract. The recent H 1 N 1 (“swine flu”) {{pandemic}} {{and recent}} H 5 N 1 (“avian flu”) outbreaks have brought increased {{attention to the}} study of the role of animal populations as reservoirs for pathogens that could invade human pop-ulations. It is believed that <b>pigs</b> acquired <b>flu</b> strains from birds and humans, acting as a mixing vessel in generating new influenza viruses. Assessing the role of animal reservoirs, particularly reservoirs involving highly mobile popu-lations (like migratory birds), on disease dispersal and persistence is of interests to a wide range of researchers including public health experts and evolutionary biologists. This paper studies the interactions between transient and resident bird populations and their role on dispersal and persistence. A metapopula-tion framework based on a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations is used to study the transmission dynamics and control of avian diseases. Simpli-fied versions of mathematical models involving a limited number of migratory and resident bird populations are analyzed. Epidemiological time scales and singular perturbation methods are used to reduce the dimensionality of th...|$|R

40|$|Swine influenza, {{also called}} pig influenza, swine flu, hog flu and <b>pig</b> <b>flu,</b> is an {{infection}} by {{any one of}} several types of swine influenza virus. Swine influenza virus (SIV) or S-OIV (swine-origin influenza virus) is any strain of the influenza family of viruses that is endemic in pigs. In H 1 N 1, the ‘H’ refers to the hemagglutinin protein, and the ‘N’ refers to the neuraminidase protein. While at present the virus is causing a mild disease, the next wave may be more severe. Influenza is a simple virus, with just eight genes, but it makes poor copies of itself, leading to constant mutation. Influenza viruses are by nature unstable and unpredictable and have the unique capability of changing their antigenic characteristics by mutation. Occasionally, novel strains also emerge, often through re-assortment or exchange of genetic material among influenza viruses from different animal, human or bird sources. Such genetic restructuring occurs regularly in nature and, at times, provides the virus with the capability of causing widespread disease in immunologically naïve populations...|$|E
40|$|Swine flu, {{also known}} as swine influenza, pig influenza, hog flu and <b>pig</b> <b>flu,</b> is a {{respiratory}} disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that infect the respiratory tract of pigs, resulting in nasal secretions, a barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behaviour. Swine flu produces most of the same symptoms in pigs as human flu produces in people. Mostly people who are closely associated with pigs (for example, pork processors and farmers) acquire the infection and similarly pigs get infected occasionally human flu infection. The cross-species infections (swine virus to man; human flu virus to pigs) have always been confined to local areas and have not spread across borders in either pigs or humans. Unfortunately, this cross-species situation with influenza viruses has {{had the potential to}} change and cause epidemics and pandemics. Most recent pandemic has been reported in 2009,  where "swine flu" strain, first seen in Mexico, was termed as H 1 N 1 as it was mainly infecting people and exhibited two main surface antigens, H 1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and N 1 (neuraminidase type 1). This unique eight RNA strands from novel H 1 N 1 flu have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains.

40|$|As {{someone who}} raises pigs, whether for show (e. g. 4 -H or Future Farmers of America [FFA]) or {{as part of}} a farming {{operation}} (i. e. commercial pork producer), you may have questions about influenza (the <b>flu)</b> in both <b>pigs</b> and people. This document addresses what is known about <b>flu</b> viruses in <b>pigs</b> and people and what people in contact with pigs can do {{to reduce the risk of}} getting sick or of getting their pigs sick. There are many causes of respiratory disease in pigs, including influenza. Among influenza types, only type A influenza viruses are known to infect pigs. Although pigs and people now share the H 1 N 1 pandemic virus, other viruses circulating in swine are different from viruses circulating in people. At this time, there are three main flu A viruses that circulate in U. S. pigs: influenza A H 1 N 1, influenza A H 1 N 2 and influenza A H 3 N 2. These viruses do not usually infect people and are genetically different from the H 1 N 1 and H 3 N 2 viruses that commonly circulate in people. When swine flu viruses are very different from the human flu viruses causing illness in people, people may have little to no immune protection against these swine viruses. Also human flu vaccines probably would not offer protection against the viruses that are found in pigs.

40|$|Background: The first {{influenza}} pandemic in the 21 st century, the past 2009 {{influenza pandemic}} (pdmH 1 N 1), {{was caused by}} a novel H 1 N 1 influenza virus. The virus was first described in April 2009 and is now believed to emerge from re-assortment of bird, <b>pig</b> and human <b>flu</b> viruses. Although this pandemic was relatively mild compared to the past pandemics, better knowledge about its characteristics in transmission dynamics and severity is still of public health interest in order to better prepare for future pandemics. Data: Clinical surveillance data were obtained from eFlu database maintained by Hong Kong Hospital Authority. Information was extracted from all pdmH 1 N 1 virologically confirmed infections (which were all symptomatic) about their dates of symptom onset, and, if applicable, dates of hospitalization, ICU admission and death. Serological data were obtained from various sources: 1) community cross-sectional serological survey; 2) convalescent serological data (from symptomatic and virologically confirmed infections); and 3) serological response kinetics data (from symptomatic and virologically confirmed infections). These serological data combined described serological responses against pdmH 1 N 1 infections in the Hong Kong population from different aspects. Methods: I constructed an age-structured natural history model to mimic the pdmH 1 N 1 transmission dynamics in Hong Kong. The transmission model was linked to hospitalization and serology in order to match the observed data. Based on all the data comprehensively, characteristic transmission parameters (basic reproductive number R 0, mean generation time E(Tg), attack rates etc.) in the model were estimated using likelihood-based statistical inferences by Bayesian inference with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Results: I estimated that R 0 is 1. 37 and E(Tg) is 2. 16 days, which are both comparable to seasonal flu. Younger age groups < 20 years were found to be more susceptible (2. 72 times compared to 20 - 29 age group) to pdmH 1 N 1 infection but older age groups 30 - 59 years were less susceptible (0. 55 times). School closure reduced 0 - 12 year olds’ within-age-group transmission effectively during the reactive kindergarten and primary school closure from Jun 10 to Jul 9 by 93 %. Summer holidays from Jun 10 to Aug 31 also reduced within-group transmission by 65 % and 13 % for 0 - 12 and 13 - 19 years olds respectively. Estimates of infection hospitalization probabilities ranged from 0. 2 % to 0. 9 % across age groups. I found that not all infected individuals would have serological response strong enough to be positive in serological test but younger age groups {{were more likely to have}} stronger serological response after infection. Conclusions: Clinical surveillance data have been used to estimate the transmission dynamics of pdmH 1 N 1 in 2009. Here, I combined hospitalization surveillance data with serological data collected throughout the first pandemic wave (April to December 2009) from different sources, which could better characterize the transmission dynamics and severity of pdmH 1 N 1 in Hong Kong. Although further validation is needed, serological surveillance should be considered as a supplementary alternative to clinical surveillance in influenza surveillance. published_or_final_versionCommunity MedicineMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
