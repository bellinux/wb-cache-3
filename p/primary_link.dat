5|$|Although the pharaoh {{delegated}} his authority, {{the performance}} of temple rituals was still an official duty, restricted to high-ranking priests. The participation of the general populace in most ceremonies was prohibited. Much of the lay religious activity in Egypt instead took place in private and community shrines, separate from the official temples. As the <b>primary</b> <b>link</b> between the human and divine realms, temples attracted considerable veneration from ordinary Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|There are 52 College Republican state federations, each {{administering}} the College Republican {{activities at the}} state level, in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and in the District of Columbia. The state federation leadership team, which includes a state chairperson and other officers, serve as the <b>primary</b> <b>link</b> between local university chapters and the national College Republican National Committee. The state chairman serves as the representative for College Republicans when dealing with the state Republican Party, local media, and governmental entities. State federations are responsible for organizing and assisting local chapters with securing proper credentials, recruitment efforts, and campus voter canvasses. It is a state federation's responsibility to organize and implement activities for statewide campaigns. Like the national organization, state federations operate as non-profit associations that are not legally affiliated with the Republican Party.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} data layout in dual link is {{designed}} so that the <b>primary</b> <b>link</b> can be fed into a single-link interface, and still produce usable (though somewhat degraded) video. The secondary link generally contains things like additional LSBs (in 12-bit formats), non-cosited samples in 4:4:4 sampled video (so that the <b>primary</b> <b>link</b> is still valid 4:2:2), and alpha or data channels. If the second link of a 1080P dual link configuration is absent, the first link still contains a valid 1080i signal.|$|E

The first link (the <b>primary</b> <b>link),</b> is assigned a link number of 1, subsequent links are assigned increasing link numbers; so the second (secondary) link in a dual-link system is link 2. The link number of a given interface is indicated by a VPID packet located in the vertical ancillary data space.|$|E
25|$|Black preachers {{provided}} leadership, encouraged {{education and}} economic growth, and were often the <b>primary</b> <b>link</b> between {{the black and}} white communities. The black church established and/or maintained the first black schools and encouraged community members to fund these schools and other public services. For most black leaders, the churches always were connected to political goals of advancing the race. There grew to be a tension between black leaders from the North and people in the South who wanted to run their churches and worship in their own way.|$|E
30|$|In our article, we {{introduce}} a resource allocation scheme for secondary users to share spectrum in a cognitive radio network. Secondary users can exploit the spectrum owned by <b>primary</b> <b>links</b> while their interference levels can exceed the given requirements {{with a small}} predefined probability. To tackle the chance constraints, we demonstrate a stochastic approach with sample average approximation method for secondary users to obtain the feedback information from <b>primary</b> <b>links</b> when channel gains are uncertain. Secondary users {{do not need to}} have the full information about the channel gains and they just need to know the outage information from the <b>primary</b> <b>links.</b> We propose two stochastic distributed learning algorithms (SDLA) to optimize the utilities with given feedback information.|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} ICaD-ARQ schemes can {{be extended}} to the case when multiple <b>primary</b> <b>links</b> exist. In this case, SUs should null the interference to any receive antenna of multiple <b>primary</b> <b>links,</b> when they utilize busy timeslots. At the same time, the interference from the transmitters of multiple <b>primary</b> <b>links</b> to the destination should be considered. Thus, the physical layer outage probability of accessing busy timeslots may be reduced. On the other hand, the MAC layer of the proposed protocols remains unchanged, since ICaD-ARQ-PS and ICaD-ARQ-QS schedule the transmission and retransmissions according to the sensing result in each timeslot and the transmission parameters. With the known statistical channel occupancy model by PUs, we can select appropriate transmission parameters by analysis and/or simulations.|$|R

The reign of Charlemagne in Western Europe is particularly noted for bringing the last major Western Arian tribes into communion with Rome, in part through conquest and forced conversion.|$|E

30|$|Resource {{allocation}} {{for secondary}} users {{is an important}} issue in cognitive radio networks. In our article, we introduce a resource allocation scheme for secondary users to share spectrum in a cognitive radio network. Secondary users can exploit the spectrum owned by <b>primary</b> <b>links</b> when the interference level does not exceed certain requirements. Uncertainties of channel gains pose a great impact on the allocation scheme. Since there are uncertainties about the channel states, we apply chance constraints to represent the interference level requirements with uncertainties. Secondary users can exceed the interference level with a predefined small probability level. Since chance constraints are generally difficult to solve and full information about the uncertain variables is not available due to the fading effects of wireless channels, we reformulate the constraints into stochastic expectation constraints. With sample average approximation method, we propose stochastic distributed learning algorithms to help secondary users satisfy the constraints with the feedback information from <b>primary</b> <b>links</b> when maximizing the utilities.|$|R
