40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) for conserving <b>public</b> <b>parks</b> in Nagasaki City. In doing so, contingent valuation method is applied. The results of the study showed that the residents of the Nagasaki City are willing to pay in total 920 million yen (5, 225 yen per household) for preserving the <b>public</b> <b>parks</b> in the city. The negative relationship between the persons visiting the <b>public</b> <b>parks</b> and the WTP, revealed from the multivariate analysis indicates that, non-use value of <b>public</b> <b>parks</b> in Nagasaki City is also very high. Finally, based on the findings of the study, some policy guidelines were given for development and maintenance of <b>public</b> <b>parks</b> in Nagasaki City, which will in turn enhance its livability.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Geographic Information System based Multicriteria Decision Making approach for evaluating accessibility to <b>public</b> <b>parks</b> in Calgary, Alberta. The approach involves the weighted linear {{combination with the}} entropy weighting method for obtaining the criterion (attribute) weights. The paper demonstrates a core-periphery pattern of accessibility to <b>public</b> <b>parks</b> in Calgary. Furthermore, the pattern has shown tendency to be more polarized between the year of 2006 and 2011. The results of this research can help the park planning authorities in identifying the needs for improving the accessibility to <b>public</b> <b>parks,</b> monitoring the changes of accessibility patterns over time, and locating new <b>public</b> <b>parks.</b> The results can also help the general public {{to better understand the}} spatial relationship between their neighbourhoods and <b>public</b> <b>parks</b> in the city...|$|R

40|$|The United States has a {{long history}} of {{providing}} <b>public</b> <b>parks</b> and amenities, especially for children. Unfortunately, children today are spending less time in <b>public</b> <b>parks,</b> less time getting physical activity and more time being indoors and sedentary. While multiple factors may be responsible for this lack of activity, multiple researchers have found the availability of parks is a significant influence on the physical activity levels of children as well as on the occurrence of obesity related illness. <b>Public</b> <b>parks</b> are ideal locations for children to get physical activity, however they are not always equitably distributed within communities. Income and race/ethnicity especially are common variables found to impact availability of parks. Such socioeconomic variables typically have an impact on the availability of <b>public</b> <b>parks</b> within a community. Such variables may also impact the quality of the parks provided. A case study of Scottsdale, Arizona was conducted analyzing the availability of <b>public</b> <b>parks</b> within the City between the years of 1990 and 2000 and the current quality of the parks.
