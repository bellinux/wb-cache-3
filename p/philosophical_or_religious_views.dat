Akan goldweights are used as counterbalances on the scales used in gold trade, visual representations of oral tradition, representations of proverbs, as pictographic script in social and political system, and in the knowledge system of the Akan people. Goldweights were used in everyday trade and commerce, as well as in accounting, as a type of fraction or counter. According to the Akan scholar Nitecki, Akan gold weights were [...] "created and used like spoken language to commemorate social or historical events or entities, to express <b>philosophical</b> <b>or</b> <b>religious</b> <b>views,</b> aspirations, and dreams, or simply to ask questions, or to express displeasure". The Akan pyramids were concrete testimonials to how the artist felt about themselves and major life events and dilemmas such as marriage, children, injustice, and personal and statewide conflicts.|$|E

40|$|Aim: This {{study focused}} on {{the vision of a}} catholic and an orthodox-protestant Dutch {{institution}} for the deaf, concerning the use of sign language in their education. The study attempted to discover underlying <b>philosophical</b> <b>or</b> <b>religious</b> motives for the use of sign language or spoken language in educating the deaf. Methods: The data used for this study was collected from a leading Dutch magazine on the education of the deaf from 1978 till 1983. In this study, a content analysis was carried out on selected articles from this magazine, aiming to find philosophical and religious motives for the acceptance or rejection of sign language. Results: The data show little <b>or</b> no <b>philosophical</b> <b>or</b> <b>religious</b> motives for, <b>or</b> against, the use of sign language in deaf education but do show practical motives. The Catholic Institute held on to the use of spoken language while the Protestant Institute seriously considered the use of signs, but the data do not show a direct relation to a religious standpoint. Conclusion: In the chosen period {{there is no evidence that}} religious arguments influenced the view on the use of sign language in deaf education...|$|R
