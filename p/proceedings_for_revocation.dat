50|$|In its trial {{decision}} the Patent Office (Trial Decision No. 20103 of 1996) {{ruled that}} if a demand for a trial for invalidation is submitted within an exclusion period and the particular statutory provisions providing the grounds for invalidation are specified in the demand, and if within the period ordered for an amendment the demand is supplemented with a detailed account and evidence, even if the date on which these amendments are submitted falls after the lapse of the exclusion period, the amendment of the demand for a trial for invalidation ought to be allowed. The Patent Office held that since the demand for the trial decision {{in this case was}} made within the exclusion period, it should not be dismissed on procedural grounds. On that basis the JPO ruled on the substance of the claim, and it issued a decision of invalidation on the grounds that X's Trademark was in breach of Article 4(1)(xv). In response X brought court <b>proceedings</b> <b>for</b> the <b>revocation</b> of this decision.|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{an effective}} <b>revocation</b> scheme <b>for</b> disconnected Delay Tolerant Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs). Malicious vehicles can exhibit various misbehaviour such as dropping packets due to selfish reasons. Selfishness can {{be due to}} the need to conserve limited resources such as energy and bandwidth. This forces vehicles to either drop all or some of the packets they receive. This is particularly obtainable in multi-hop forwarding networks where packets are routed from one vehicle to another towards their destination. When some packets are dropped, the usefulness of the system is not fully realised since it affects the quality of information available to vehicles for making driving decisions such as road manoeuvres. Additionally, packet dropping can degrade the routing efficiency of the system. In extreme cases of misbehaviour, it is important to stop such vehicles from further participation in network communication. One way of achieving this is through revocation. However, it is important to establish mechanisms for identifying such vehicles before blacklisting them <b>for</b> <b>revocation.</b> Our objective here is to address the question of how much we can use a trust-based scheme where vehicles cannot always be expected to follow normal protocols <b>for</b> <b>revocation.</b> Revocation or suspension of misbehaving vehicles is essential to avoid havoc and possible economic damage...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Providing an {{efficient}} <b>revocation</b> mechanism <b>for</b> attribute-based encryption (ABE) {{is of utmost}} importance since over time an user’s credentials may be revealed or expired. All previously known revocable ABE (RABE) constructions (a) essentially utilize the complete subtree (CS) scheme <b>for</b> <b>revocation</b> purpose, (b) are bounded {{in the sense that}} the size of the public parameters depends linearly on the size of the attribute universe and logarithmically on the number of users in the system, and (c) are either selectively secure, which seems unrealistic in a dynamic system such as RABE, or fully secure but built in a composite order bilinear group setting, which is undesirable from the point of view of both efficiency and security. This paper presents the first fully secure unbounded RABE using subset difference (SD) mechanism <b>for</b> <b>revocation</b> which greatly improves the broadcast efficiency compared to the CS scheme. Our RABE scheme is built on a prime order bilinear group setting resulting in practical computation cost, and its security depends on the Decisional Linear assumption...|$|R
