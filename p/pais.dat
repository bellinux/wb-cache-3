5|$|After {{purchasing}} a decrepit yacht, the Granma, on 25 November 1956 Castro set sail from Tuxpan, Veracruz, with 81 revolutionaries armed with 90 rifles, 3 machine guns, around 40 pistols and 2 hand-held anti-tank guns. The 1,200 mile crossing to Cuba was harsh, {{and in the}} overcrowded conditions of the ship, many suffered seasickness, and food supplies ran low. At some points they had to bail water caused by a leak, and at another a man fell overboard, delaying their journey. The plan had been for the crossing to take 5 days, and on the ship's scheduled day of arrival, 30 November, MR-26-7 members under Frank <b>Pais</b> led an armed uprising against government buildings in Santiago, Manzanillo and several other towns. However, the Granmas journey ultimately lasted 7 days, and with Castro and his men unable to provide reinforcements, <b>Pais</b> and his militants dispersed {{after two days of}} intermittent attacks.|$|E
5|$|There he met Antonio Nariño and Francisco Antonio Zea {{and began}} to develop his ideas on liberty. In 1789, one of his followers, Juan Pio Montufar, arrived in Bogotá, and both men got the {{approval}} of important members of {{the government for the}} creation of the Escuela de la Concordia, called later the Sociedad Patriótica de Amigos del <b>País</b> de Quito (Patriotic Society of Friends of the Country of Quito). The Sociedad Económica de los Amigos del <b>País</b> (Economic Society of Friends of the Country) was a private association established in various cities throughout Enlightenment Spain and, to a lesser degree, in some of her colonies. Espejo successfully defended himself on the charges against him, and on October 2, 1789, he was set free. On December 2 he was notified he could return to Quito.|$|E
5|$|Chiappucci {{believed}} that the descents of the mountains included in the race were very difficult. An El <b>País</b> writer found the route to be more mountainous than in years past. In addition, the writer mentioned {{that the increase in}} mountains within the route coupled with the reduced amount of time trial kilometers, including the lack of a prologue, favored Marco Pantani. Three-time winner Gino Bartali {{believed that}} the route for the Giro was harder than the same year's Tour de France course.|$|E
5|$|Directly {{after the}} war {{he worked as a}} bank clerk and later as a journalist. During this time he began writing plays and poetry. In 1941 Roa Bastos won the Ateneo Paraguayo prize for Fulgencia Miranda, {{although}} the book was never published. In the early 1940s he spent significant time on the yerba mate plantations in northern Paraguay, an experience he would later draw upon in his first published novel, Hijo de hombre (1960; Son of Man). In 1942 he was appointed editorial secretary for the Asunción daily El <b>País.</b>|$|E
5|$|Former President of the United States Barack Obama {{has said}} that The Wire is his {{favorite}} television series. The 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature Laureate, Mario Vargas Llosa, wrote a very positive critical review of the series in the Spanish journal El <b>País.</b> The comedian turned mayor of Reykjavík, Iceland, Jón Gnarr, {{has gone so far}} as to say that he would not enter a coalition government with anyone who has not watched the series.|$|E
5|$|In 1944 the British Council awarded Roa Bastos a nine-month {{fellowship}} for {{journalism in}} London. During {{this time he}} traveled extensively in Britain, France and Africa and witnessed the devastation of WWII first hand. He served as the El <b>País</b> war correspondent, notably conducting an interview with General Charles de Gaulle after the latter's return to Paris in 1945. Roa Bastos also broadcast Latin American programs {{at the invitation of}} the BBC and France's Ministry of Information.|$|E
5|$|In a 16 December 2008 interview, {{when asked}} by the Spanish {{newspaper}} El <b>País</b> if Litvinenko could {{have been killed in}} the interests of the Russian state, Lugovoy – wanted by British police on suspicion of the murder of Litvinenko – replied that he would order the assassination of anyone, for example, President Saakashvili of Georgia and the KGB defector Gordievsky, in the interests of the Russian state.|$|E
5|$|In April, Contador {{claimed a}} convincing {{victory in the}} Vuelta al <b>País</b> Vasco, taking the race lead by winning the mountainous Stage 3 and {{dominating}} the final time trial. Though they did not race as Astana due to UCI rules, Armstrong, Leipheimer, and Chris Horner {{took part in the}} Tour of the Gila at the end of April and early May in what was Armstrong's first race back from the collarbone injury, with Leipheimer and Armstrong finishing in the top two places. With a squad made up of riders that normally ride in support for others, the team took a stage win (Klöden) and second overall (Janez Brajkovič) in the Giro del Trentino, also in April.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} this, {{observers}} such as Nobel Prize-winning physicist Luis Alvarez {{have suggested that}} if he had lived long enough to see his predictions substantiated by experiment, Oppenheimer might have won a Nobel Prize for his work on gravitational collapse, concerning neutron stars and black holes. In retrospect, some physicists and historians consider this to be his most important contribution, though it was not taken up by other scientists in his own lifetime. The physicist and historian Abraham <b>Pais</b> once asked Oppenheimer what he considered to be his most important scientific contributions; Oppenheimer cited his work on electrons and positrons, not his work on gravitational contraction. Oppenheimer was nominated for the Nobel Prize for physics three times, in 1945, 1951 and 1967, but never won.|$|E
5|$|Luis Gómez, an El <b>Pais</b> writer, {{believed}} that the route was designed to benefit the Italian participants, with there being three individual time trials, the team time trial being flat, and most stages being primarily flat. El Mundo writer Javier Dalmases {{believed that}} the route was purposefully less mountainous so that an Italian would win the race, citing that this route favored the likes of Giuseppe Saronni or Moreno Argentin. La Stampas Gian Paolo Ormezzano thought overall easiness of the course — the few mountains and summit finishes — added some mystery as to who could win.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer brought {{together}} intellectuals {{at the height}} of their powers and from a variety of disciplines to answer the most pertinent questions of the age. He directed and encouraged the research of many well-known scientists, including Freeman Dyson, and the duo of Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee, who won a Nobel Prize for their discovery of parity non-conservation. He also instituted temporary memberships for scholars from the humanities, such as T. S. Eliot and George F. Kennan. Some of these activities were resented by a few members of the mathematics faculty, who wanted the institute to stay a bastion of pure scientific research. Abraham <b>Pais</b> said that Oppenheimer himself thought that one of his failures at the institute was being unable to bring together scholars from the natural sciences and the humanities.|$|E
5|$|The current Basque {{coat of arms}} (Spanish: Escudo del <b>País</b> Vasco, Basque: Euskal autonomi erkidegoaren armarria) is the {{official}} coat of arms of the Basque Country, Autonomous community of Spain. It consists of a party per cross representing the three historical territories of Álava, Gipuzkoa and Biscay, {{as well as a}} fourth, void quarter. The arms are ringed by a regal wreath of oak leaves, symbolic of the Gernikako Arbola. The fourth quarter constituted since the late 19th century the linked chains of Navarre; however, following a legal suit by the Navarre Government claiming that the usage of the arms of a region on the flag of another was illegal, the Constitutional Court of Spain ordered the removal of the chains of Navarre in a judgement of 1986.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} peloton did {{include the}} previous year's winner Gianni Bugno. He {{also stated that}} Claudio Chiappucci would likely contend for the overall crown due to his good form coming into the race. According to Paolo Viberti of El <b>País,</b> Bugno came in as the odds on favorite to win the race. Eugenio Capodacqua of La Repubblica and La Stampas Gianni Ranieri believed that the race was going be won by either Chiappucci or Bugno. Despite being favored to win the race, Bugno entered the race with no victories to his name that season. American Greg LeMond told the press he planned to be more competitive at this Giro than he had in years past. Other favorites to win the race were Laurent Fignon, Pedro Delgado, and Marino Lejarreta.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} peloton included Evgeni Berzin, the 1994 winner. Berzin's team, , {{also brought}} Latvian Piotr Ugrumov, a two-time Grand Tour runner-up. The two riders {{had developed a}} mutual distaste for each other. El <b>País</b> writers Paolo Viberti and Carlos Arribas believed that Swiss rider Tony Rominger and Latvian Piotr Ugrumov were the favorites to win the race, while Adrian Huber of Avui named Rominger as the sole favorite. Author Bill McGann believed that Rominger and Berzin were in great form coming into the race. Rominger entered the event after having recently won the Tour de Romandie. Aside from Rominger and Berzin, El Punts Luis Simon named 1988 winner Andrew Hampsten, Russian Pavel Tonkov, and Claudio Chiappucci amongst several other riders that could challenge for the overall title.|$|E
5|$|The team's biggest {{success in}} 2009 was Contador's overall {{victory in the}} Tour de France. Elsewhere, their main successes in 2009 were in small stage races, with Contador winning the Volta ao Algarve and the Vuelta al <b>País</b> Vasco {{as well as two}} stages in Paris–Nice, and Leipheimer winning the Tour of California and the Vuelta a Castilla y León. The team also won the team {{classification}} at numerous events. The team {{failed to live up to}} lofty expectations in the Giro d'Italia; Leipheimer was widely considered a favorite for victory, as was Armstrong before a collarbone injury sustained weeks before, but Leipheimer finished sixth overall and the team did not win any stage.|$|E
5|$|Across Cuba, anti-Batista groups {{carried out}} bombings and sabotage; police responded with mass arrests, torture, and extrajudicial executions. In March 1957, the DR {{launched}} a failed {{attack on the}} presidential palace, during which Antonio was shot dead. Frank <b>País</b> was also killed, leaving Castro the MR-26-7's unchallenged leader. Although Guevara and Raúl were well known for their Marxist–Leninist views, Castro hid his, hoping to gain the support of less radical revolutionaries. In 1957 he met with leading members of the Partido Ortodoxo, Raúl Chibás and Felipe Pazos, authoring the Sierra Maestra Manifesto, in which they demanded that a provisional civilian government be set up to implement moderate agrarian reform, industrialization, and a literacy campaign before holding multiparty elections. As Cuba's press was censored, Castro contacted foreign media to spread his message; he became a celebrity after being interviewed by Herbert Matthews, a journalist from The New York Times. Reporters from CBS and Paris Match soon followed.|$|E
5|$|In April, {{the team}} {{achieved}} great {{success in the}} Vuelta al <b>País</b> Vasco, with Contador winning the opening stage, which had seven categorized climbs, and the final individual time trial, to win the race overall. Just after the tour of the Basque country was the Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey, an event in which Astana won a stage with Grégory Rast and the points classification with Assan Bazayev. Later in the month, the team sent a squad headed by Leipheimer and Chris Horner to the Tour de Georgia. They did not win any stage, but Leipheimer took third overall, and Antonio Colóm fourth. The team was greatly successful at the Tour de Romandie later in the month, with Maxim Iglinskiy and Klöden both winning stages, and Klöden the race overall. In the Volta a Catalunya, which was concurrent to the Giro d'Italia, the team did not win any stage, with Janez Brajkovič's second in Stage 2 their closest result, though they did win the teams classification.|$|E
5|$|Several {{media outlets}} {{attempted}} {{to place the}} work within a particular genre. MTV compared the song's style to the group Devo and new wave music. El <b>País</b> described the piece as an electropop song {{that contributed to the}} viral spread of the Christian Bale rant after its release on the Internet. Dose described it as an electro jam session which made adept use of sampling from the audio of Bale's rhetoric. The Los Angeles Times called the piece a lively pop music tribute to the actor. USA Today called the song fun dance music and creatively motivated. The Toronto Sun praised its original lyrics and use of audio from the incident, and described the piece as a fusion of electro-pop styles and a good song for dancing. New Musical Express recommended the piece, and described it as electro-rock which astutely sampled Bale throughout the song. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch described the piece as a form of new wave music which used the most spasmodic segments of the incident, and commented that the end product was comedic. The Arizona Daily Star described the piece as a pop music dance song.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} peloton did {{include the}} previous year's winner Franco Chioccioli. According to author Bill McGann, Miguel Indurain {{came into the}} race with the aims of riding it for preparation for the Tour de France in July. Claudio Chiappucci came into the race as a contender after finishing on the podium at the previous season's Giro d'Italia and Tour de France. The Spanish newspaper El <b>País</b> believed Indurain to be the favorite heading into {{the first day of}} racing. However, the newspaper did state that his chances were lower since his teammate Jean-François Bernard was not participating in the race due to an injury. l'Unità writer Dario Ceccarelli and Avui writer Recuero believed that Chiappucci and Indurain were the favorites to win the overall crown. Spanish newspaper Diari de Girona named Indurain, Chiappucci, Laurent Fignon, and Massimiliano Lelli the main contenders to win the race.|$|E
5|$|Thirteen Egyptian wrestlers, twelve {{men and one}} woman, {{qualified}} for the Olympics. In the men's freestyle tournament, only Hassan Madany in the 60 kg class defeated an opponent, winning his bout against Didier <b>Pais</b> of France in the round of 16 before losing to North Korea's Ri Jong-Myong in the quarterfinals. Madany was {{a veteran of the}} 2008 tournament, where he lost his first bout against eventual bronze medalist Morad Mohammadi of Iran, and {{qualified for}} the 2012 Games by winning the African and Oceania qualification tournament. Among numerous honors, he was a seven-time African champion (2002, 2005–2009, and 2012) and also won gold medals at the 2005 and 2009 Mediterranean Games and the 2011 Pan Arab Games. The only other Egyptian freestyle wrestler to take part in more than one bout was Ibrahim Farag in the 55 kg class, who lost against eventual silver medalist Vladimer Khinchegashvili of Georgia in the qualification round and Bulgaria's Radoslav Velikov in the repechage. He was African senior champion in 2010 and junior champion in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the primary}} sources, i.e., those {{composed}} by the Jesuits themselves {{during the years}} 1691 through 1767, {{those that have been}} extensively researched (many as yet have not been thoroughly examined) are few. The most useful is the monumental Historia general de la Compañía de Jesús en la Provincia del Perú: Crónica anómina de 1600 que trata del establecimiento y misiones de la Compañía de Jesús en los países de habla española en la América meridional, vol. II, edited by Francisco Mateos (Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, 1944). Also of importance is the unedited archive of correspondence from the Jesuits of Paraguay from the years 1690-1718. Collectively known as “Cartas a los Provinciales de la Provincia del Paraguay 1690-1718,” these manuscripts are housed in the Jesuit Archives of Argentina in Buenos Aires, which also contain the invaluable annals of the Paraguay Province of the Company of Jesus, covering the years 1689-1762. The German edition of Fr. Julián Knogler’s Inhalt einer Beschreibung der Missionen deren Chiquiten, Archivum Historicum Societatis Jesu, 39/78 (Rome: Company of Jesus, 1970) is indispensable, as is his account Relato sobre el <b>país</b> y la nación de los Chiquitos en las Indias Occidentales o América del Sud y en la misiones en su territorio, for a condensed version of which, see Werner Hoffman, Las misiones jesuíticas entre los chiquitanos (Buenos Aires: Fundación para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura, 1979). Fr. Juan de Montenegro’s Breve noticia de las missiones, peregrinaciones apostólicas, trabajos, sudor, y sangre vertida, en obsequio de la fe, de el venerable padre Augustín Castañares, de la Compañía de Jesús, insigne missionero de la provincia del Paraguay, en las missiones de Chiquitos, Zamucos, y ultimamente en la missión de los infieles Mataguayos, (Madrid: Manuel Fernández, Impresor del Supremo Consejo de la Inquisición, de la Reverenda Cámara Apostólica, y del Convento de las Señoras de la Encarnación, en la Caba Baxa, 1746) and Fr. Juan Patricio Fernández’s Relación historial de las misiones de los indios, que llaman chiquitos, que están a cargo de los padres de la Compañía de Jesús de la provincia del Paraguay (Madrid: Manuel Fernández, Impresor de Libros, 1726) are also valuable. There are other primary sources as yet unexamined, the majority of which are archived in Cochabamba, Sucre, and Tarija (in Bolivia); Buenos Aires, Córdoba, and Tucumán (in Argentina); Asunción (Paraguay); Madrid; and Rome.|$|E
