5|$|The mass balance, or {{difference}} between accumulation and ablation (melting and sublimation), of a glacier {{is crucial to}} its survival. Climate change may cause variations in both temperature and snowfall, resulting in changes in mass balance. A glacier with a sustained negative balance loses equilibrium and retreats. A sustained <b>positive</b> <b>balance</b> is also out of equilibrium and will advance to reestablish equilibrium. Currently, nearly all glaciers have a negative mass balance and are retreating.|$|E

25|$|In China, {{recreational}} use {{began in}} the 15th century, but was limited by its rarity and expense. Opium trade became more regular by the 17th century, when it was mixed with tobacco for smoking, and addiction was first recognized. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the tobacco pipe, opium was only taken orally; when smoked, the drug has a far more potent effect, and its addictive effect is greatly magnified. Opium prohibition in China began in 1729, yet was followed by nearly two centuries of increasing opium use. China had a <b>positive</b> <b>balance</b> sheet in trading with the British, which led to a decrease of the British silver stocks. Therefore, the British tried to encourage Chinese opium use to enhance their balance, and they delivered it from Indian provinces under British control. In India, its cultivation, as well as the manufacture and traffic to China, were subject to the British East India Company (BEIC), as a strict monopoly of the British government. Indian farmers were forced by the British East India company to grow poppy against their wishes, often using a combination of strong arm tactics and debt. There was an extensive and complicated system of BEIC agencies involved in the supervision and management of opium production and distribution in India. A massive destruction of opium by an emissary of the Chinese Daoguang Emperor in an attempt to stop opium imports led to the First Opium War (18391842), in which Britain defeated China. After 1860, opium use continued to increase with widespread domestic production in China. By 1905, an estimated 25 percent of the male population were regular consumers of the drug. Recreational use of opium elsewhere in the world remained rare into late in the 19th century, as indicated by ambivalent reports of opium usage.|$|E
2500|$|A glacier with a {{sustained}} negative balance {{is out of}} equilibrium and will retreat, while one with {{a sustained}} <b>positive</b> <b>balance</b> is out of equilibrium and will advance. Glacier retreat results {{in the loss of}} the low elevation region of the glacier. Since higher elevations are cooler than lower ones, the disappearance of the lowest portion of the glacier reduces overall ablation, thereby increasing mass balance and potentially reestablishing equilibrium. [...] However, if the mass balance of {{a significant portion of the}} accumulation zone of the glacier is negative, it is in disequilibrium with the local climate. Such a glacier will melt away with a continuation of this local climate.|$|E
2500|$|Mass {{balance is}} {{measured}} by determining the amount of snow accumulated during winter, and later measuring the amount of snow and ice removed by melting in the summer. The {{difference between these two}} parameters is the mass balance. If the amount of snow accumulated during the winter is larger than the amount of melted snow and ice during the summer, the mass balance is positive and the glacier has increased in volume. On the other hand, if the melting of snow and ice during the summer is larger than the supply of snow in the winter, the mass balance is negative and the glacier volume decreases. Mass balance is reported in meters of water equivalent. [...] This represents the average thickness gained (<b>positive</b> <b>balance)</b> or lost (negative balance) from the glacier during that particular year.|$|E

2500|$|Britain in the 1930s had an exclusionary trading bloc with {{nations of}} the British Empire known as the [...] "Sterling Area". If Britain {{imported}} more than it exported to nations such as South Africa, South African recipients of pounds sterling tended to put them into London banks. [...] This meant that though Britain was running a trade deficit, it had a financial account surplus, and payments balanced. [...] Increasingly, Britain's <b>positive</b> <b>balance</b> of payments required keeping the wealth of Empire nations in British banks. [...] One incentive for, say, South African holders of rand to park their wealth in London {{and to keep the}} money in Sterling, was a strongly valued pound sterling. [...] Unfortunately, as Britain deindustrialized in the 1920s, {{the way out of the}} trade deficit was to devalue the currency.

Methods: After approval from an institutional review board, a retrospective cohort study was conducted. All consecutive patients undergoing thoracotomy between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2011 in a single medical center were recruited. The primary outcome of the study was the incidence of cardiovascular complications, which were defined as cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, heart failure, myocardial ischemia, and pulmonary embolism. Univariable and multivariable risk regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between <b>positive</b> fluid <b>balance</b> and cardiovascular complications. Results: A total of 720 patients were included in this study. The incidence of cardiovascular complications after thoracotomy for noncancer lesions was 6. 7 % (48 of 720). Patients with <b>positive</b> fluid <b>balance</b> > 2, 000 mL had a significantly higher incidence of cardiovascular complications than those with <b>positive</b> fluid <b>balance</b> ≤ 2, 000 mL (22. 2 % versus 7. 0 %, P= 0. 005). Cardiac arrhythmias were the most common complication. Univariable risk regression showed that <b>positive</b> fluid <b>balance</b> > 2, 000 mL was a significant risk factor (risk ratio = 3. 15, 95 % confident interval [CI] = 1. 44 – 6. 90, P-value = 0. 004). After adjustment for all potential confounding variables during multivariable risk regression analysis, <b>positive</b> fluid <b>balance</b> > 2, 000 mL remained a strong risk factor for cardiovascular complications (risk ratio = 2. 18, 95 % CI = 1. 36 – 3. 51, P-value = 0. 001). Causes of <b>positive</b> fluid <b>balance</b> > 2, 000 mL included excessive hemorrhage (48 %), hypotension without excessive hemorrhage (29. 6 %), and liberal fluid administration (22. 4 %). Conclusion: <b>Positive</b> fluid <b>balance</b> was a significant risk factor for cardiovascular complications. Strategies to minimize <b>positive</b> fluid <b>balance</b> during surgery for patients at high risk of cardiovascular complications include preparing adequate blood and blood products, considering appropriate hemoglobin level as a transfusion trigger, and adjusting the optimal dose of local anesthetic for intraoperative thoracic epidural analgesia.

40|$|Introduction: Intravenous fluid {{administration}} {{is an essential}} component of sepsis management, but a <b>positive</b> fluid <b>balance</b> has been associated with worse prognosis. We analyzed whether a <b>positive</b> fluid <b>balance</b> and its persistence over time was an independent prognostic factor in septic patients. Methods: We prospectively studied fluid intake and output for 7 days in 173 consecutive adult patients treated for sepsis in our Department of Intensive Care. Results: Of the 173 patients, 59 died (34 %). Mean daily fluid intake was higher in non-survivors than in survivors (59 ± 24 ml/kg vs. 48 ± 23 ml/kg, p = 0. 03), but output volumes were similar. As a result, the daily fluid balance was more than twice as large in the non-survivors as in the survivors (29 ± 22 vs. 13 ± 19 ml/kg, p < 0. 001). Persistence of a <b>positive</b> fluid <b>balance</b> over time was associated with increased mortality. Using a multivariable time-dependent Cox model, a <b>positive</b> fluid <b>balance</b> was independently associated with higher mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1. 014 [1. 007 - 1. 022] per ml/kg increase, p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Persistence of a <b>positive</b> daily fluid <b>balance</b> over time was quite strongly associated with a higher mortality rate in septic patients.

40|$|During {{the past}} years, {{a large amount}} of {{photovoltaic}} (PV) capacity has been installed in Belgium. The main driver for this was the abundant government support (GreenPower Certicates). However, during the last few years, the support for new installations has been withdrawn and new PV capacity ceased. In previous research, it has been proven that selling PV energy of existing plants directly on the wholesale market is not feasible due to the large share of green power certicates awarded to these plants. However, the price of green power certicates has dropped signicantly and hence the balance between certicate and commodity revenue is restored.
