40|$|As average tariff {{rates have}} fallen, {{countries}} have increasingly turned to GATT-sanctioned ``special protection'' - especially <b>antidumping</b> <b>duties</b> - to restrict imports when import volumes increase suddenly. In this paper, I analyze {{a model of}} dumping among imperfectly competitive firms that face stochastic demand. I show that an <b>antidumping</b> <b>duty</b> can improve an importing-country's welfare when it faces dumping caused by weak foreign demand. Interestingly, the <b>antidumping</b> <b>duty</b> does not completely {{stem the tide of}} dumped imports, but it improves welfare through shifting some of the dumping firm's rents to the home country. Even when faced with an <b>antidumping</b> <b>duty,</b> a foreign firm that serves more than one market will prefer dumping and paying an <b>antidumping</b> <b>duty</b> over negotiating a voluntary export restraint because dumping allows it to earn higher revenues in its own market. <b>Antidumping</b> <b>duties...</b>|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown a {{relationship}} between <b>antidumping</b> <b>duty</b> and collusion. These studies, however, only focus on collusion in output (downstream) market, i. e. collusion between import competing firms and exporters, or among import competing firms. This dissertation explores how the <b>antidumping</b> <b>duty</b> on downstream goods can affect collusive behavior in an upstream market of exporters whom are sub jected to the duty. Bertrand duopoly model with infinite periods is developed to {{examine the effect of}} the <b>antidumping</b> <b>duty</b> on collusive behavior. Under a set of discount rate, whether is influenced by a tariff or the <b>antidumping</b> <b>duty,</b> the exporters will fully cooperate. The unaffected rate might be due to the linearity in input supply and output demand assumptions. Although the discount rate is not suffciently high enough to support the full cooperation, the collusive behavior is still feasible through self-enforcing agreement. With future period self-enforcing agreement, under the <b>antidumping</b> <b>duty,</b> the full cooperation in the initial period that is feasible under a set of the discount rate is called "the restricted full cooperation". The set under free trade that supports the full cooperation is smaller than the one supporting the restricted full cooperation. Therefore, the <b>antidumping</b> <b>duty</b> on downstream goods is pro-collusive in the upstream market. The theoretical result is tested by using Thai shrimp industry data during 1996 - 2009; the industry has been sub jected to the U.

We first develop a theoretical model of worldwide trade in which {{the imposition of a}} special import restraint by one country - an <b>antidumping</b> <b>duty</b> or a safeguard measure - causes significant distortions in world trade flows. We then empirically test this model by investigating the effect of US special import restraints on Japanese exports of roughly 3500 commodities into 29 countries between 1992 and 2001. Our estimation of a fixed-effects model of Japanese exports yields evidence that US import restraints both deflect and depress Japanese export flows. Imposition of a US <b>antidumping</b> <b>duty</b> against Japan deflects trade: export growth to non-US trading partners rises by 11 to 22 percentage points. The simultaneous imposition of a US <b>antidumping</b> <b>duty</b> against both Japan and a third country depresses trade: Japanese export growth to the third country falls by 0 to 18 percentage points. The magnitude of the trade depression effect is also larger when the US imposes an <b>antidumping</b> <b>duty</b> against a third country but not against Japan.

40|$|The voluminous {{literature}} on the U. S. antidumping laws has a curious lacuna. There is little in this literature {{about the effects of}} <b>antidumping</b> <b>duties</b> on the volume of subject imports. One reason this key question has not frequently been investigated is the lack of data. U. S. <b>antidumping</b> <b>duties</b> are firm specific, while information about U. S. imports is collected by commodity and country, but not by firm. This paper avoids this problem by examining a sample of U. S. antidumping orders for which the duties were the same for all firms from a given country, or for which there was only one foreign firm exporting the product from the foreign country in question. Using this sample, the present paper is the first study of which the author is aware that investigates the relation between <b>antidumping</b> <b>duties</b> and subject imports using accurate information about the level of <b>antidumping</b> <b>duties.</b> The paper is also unique in accurately measuring the quantity of imports affected by the <b>antidumping</b> <b>duties.</b> The study uses import quantity data reported by the USITC in its Sunset Review reports, rather than using ten-digit HTUSA categories, which sometimes do not match antidumping product definitions precisely. The price of using this unique dataset is that the current study is restricted to a sample of only 32 of the approximately 350 antidumping orders originating during the relevant years, of which about 188 are still in effect. Some evidence is presented suggesting that the sample of orders used may be representative of the larger universe. For the sample examined, the paper finds an elasticity of subject imports with respect to U. S. <b>antidumping</b> <b>duties</b> of roughly 0. 9. The paper also finds some evidence that age of the antidumping order may be a factor in explaining reduction in volume of subject imports. Study of this effect may be {{complicated by the fact that}} the initial level of all U. S. <b>antidumping</b> <b>duties</b> was lower during the early 1980 s than in the early 1990 s; so older orders tend to have lower duties.
