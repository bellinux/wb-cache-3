Typically, a 25-pair cable coming from the phone company is punched down {{on the left side of}} the block in pairs.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} two experiments {{that show the}} powerful influence of interface complexity and entropy on online information sharing behaviour. 134 {{participants were asked to}} do a creativity test and answer six open questions against three different screen backgrounds of increasing complexity. Our data shows that, as an interface becomes more complex and has more entropy users refer less to themselves and show less information sharing breadth. However, their verbal creativity and information sharing depth do not suffer in the same way. Instead, an inverse U shaped relationship between Interface complexity and creativity as well as information sharing depth can be observed: Users become more creative and thoughtful until a certain tipping <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interface</b> complexity is reached. At that point, creativity and th inking suffer, leading to significantly less disclosure. This result challenges the general HCI assumption that simplicity is always best for computers interface design, as users'creativity and information sharing depth initially increases with more interface complexity.

40|$|We have {{identified}} a putative membrane-interacting domain preceding the transmembrane domain of the Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) glycoprotein H (gH). Peptides derived from this region interact strongly with membranes and show a high tendency to partition at the interface. This region is predicted to bind at the membrane interface by adopting an a helical structure. Peptides representing either the HSV- 1 gH pretransmembrane region or a scrambled control with a different hydrophobic profile at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interface</b> have been studied. The peptides derived from this domain of gH induce the fusion of liposomal membranes, adopt helical conformations in membrane mimetic environments {{and are able to}} inhibit HSV- 1 infectivity. The pretransmembrane region appears to be a common feature in viral fusion proteins of several virus families, and such a feature might be related to their fusogenic function.

40|$|The {{critical}} parameters for propane were determined using an Automation Products Dynatrol Detector. The Dynatrol {{is a system}} of coupled vibrating masses, whose resonant frequencies are functions of {{the density of the}} fluid surrounding one of the masses, namely the paddle which can be immersed in a test fluid. If the paddle is partly surrounded by liquid and partially by vapor, the resonant frequencies are measures of liquid level. An experimental cell was filled at room temperature with propane such that two phases existed. The paddle of the Dynatrol was located in the cell such that, as the cell was rotated, the paddle was immersed first in the vapor phase, next in the liquid phase, and finally partially in both phases. The temperature of the cell was raised and the amount of propane in the cell adjusted so that the Dynatrol frequencies indicated that the cell was half-full of liquid. If the interface of the two phases disappeared at the half-full point, the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interface</b> disappearance was the critical point.

40|$|We {{consider}} growing interfaces as dynamical networks whose nodes are the discrete <b>points</b> <b>of</b> the <b>interface</b> and {{the edges}} the physical interactions among them. We map the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> the <b>interface</b> formed at each time into a graph {{by means of}} a visibility algorithm. As the corresponding interfaces grow, their visibility graphs change over time. We show that the visibility graphs are all scale free for each time. We use the variance of the node degrees as a measure of the dynamical properties of these graphs. This magnitude reveals an unexpected scaling behaviour of these graphs in both the number of nodes and time. This enables to define three robust exponents that characterize any type of dynamics with more detail than the classical scaling analysis applied directly to the physical interfaces. To check the feasibility of this approach we study and classify six different dynamical processes and estimate their critical exponents. We conclude that the dynamics of physical systems far from equilibrium can be determined by its corresponding visibility network. Indeed, this methodology is able to discern among dynamical processes that hitherto have been classified in the same universality class according to the scaling analysis <b>of</b> their <b>interfaces...</b>|$|R

40|$|When {{the colors}} of all the U. S. armed services' uniforms are combined, the color purple appears; therefore, {{military}} insiders refer to inter-service operations as "purple" operations. Now a core concept, the "jointness" of U. S. military strategic response to a critical operational failure encapsulates principles and processes through which two or more armed services are best able to integrate strategies, strengths, and capabilities in ways that yield genuine synergies, despite the differences in mission and culture that naturally separate the services. The now ingrained ability of military services to "go purple" quickly has materially contributed to strategic and operational successes during the last 20 years. The internal circumstances as well as global environmental challenges faced by domestic firms, particularly at the marketing-manufacturing (M-M) interface, resonate with those faced by the U.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with two overlapping issues. In the first instance, we consider the apparent tensions between the visible effects of globalisation upon the Japanese economy and the claims of successive commentators that novel Japanese production systems of co-ordination and vertical supply are particularly conducive both to national and regional industrial stability. Secondly, we set out a critical reassessment of the lessons that the literature has drawn to date from both the evident successes and current difficulties of Japan’s post-Second World War economy; taking as the framework of reference contributions such as Aoki (1988, 1990, 1994) on the J-mode firm, Katzner (1999) on comparative economy and culture, and Porter et. al (2000) on Japan’s present economic crisis. This paper argues that (a) the basis {{for many of the}} claims of historic novelty in forms of material organisation in Japanese industry is surprisingly weak, that (b) these claims have encouraged an unwarranted tendency towards neglect of the problems posed for the national and regional economy by the globalising activities of Japan’s large transnational corporations (TNCs), and that (c) analysis should dwell less on the supposed novelties at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interface</b> between production unit and market or in the conduct o...|$|E
40|$|The {{remarkable}} {{challenges and}} {{possibilities of the}} coming few decades will compel the biogeochemical and astrobiological sciences to characterize the interactions between biology and its environment in a fundamental, mechanistic, and quantitative fashion. The clear need for integrative and scalable biology-environment models is exemplified in the Earth sciences by the challenge of effectively addressing anthropogenic global change, and in the space sciences by the challenge of mounting a well-constrained yet sufficiently adaptive and inclusive search for life beyond Earth. Our understanding of the life-planet interaction is still, however, largely empirical. A variety of approaches seek to move from empirical to mechanistic descriptions. One approach focuses {{on the relationship between}} biology and energy, which is at once universal (all life requires energy), unique (life manages energy flow in a fashion not seen in abiotic systems), and amenable to characterization and quantification in thermodynamic terms. Simultaneously, a focus on energy flow addresses a critical <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interface</b> between life and its geological, chemical, and physical environment.
