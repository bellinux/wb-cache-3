There were claims that the two bore ill will against each other, {{and that they had}} to record the song separately due to constant tension.

5|$|Another wealthy family, the Eccles, {{commissioned}} Arrington {{to write}} a biography of David Eccles, a millionaire who helped form the industrial economy in Utah. David Eccles was a polygamist, and the descendants of his two wives, Bertha Jensen in Ogden and Ellen Stoddard in Logan, did not agree about how the biography should be written. Nora Harrison from the Logan {{part of the family}} originally commissioned the biography, but did not own enough material for the necessary research. Cleone Eccles, David's daughter-in-law from the Ogden side of the family, wanted a biography that focused on only <b>positive</b> <b>things</b> about David Eccles, while Harrison wanted a professional, scholarly work. In order to access Cleone Eccles's collection of David Eccles's manuscripts, Harrison agreed to give Cleone the right to make alterations to the text. Arrington employed JoAnn Bair to do the research and first drafts of the work. Harrison was unhappy with the manuscript and paid their neighbor and writer Wallace Stegner to critique the manuscript; his 15-page guidelines advised the writer to engage the reader through cliffhangers, flashbacks, and speculation. Stegner also found the manuscript too gentle on David Eccles's fraudulent business dealings. To appease Harrison, Arrington had Maureen Ursenbach Beecher improve the manuscript's literary style, but the final biography still lacked real criticism of Eccles's business practices.|$|E

Isham praised Spears' attitude to the filming of the scene, claiming that she [...] "had not a blink of fear" [...] during the shoot, Spears is sitting on top of a cliff, surrounded by cliffs. Isham also considered the music video one of his favorites, commenting that he had [...] "nothing but <b>positive</b> <b>things</b> to say about my experience with her and what she's doing right now" [...] and that Spears [...] "stepped into it with positive energy.

500|$|Hordern {{first met}} the British theatre {{director}} Jonathan Miller in 1968. Miller, {{who had long}} been an admirer of Hordern, offered him {{the part of the}} agonistic Professor Parkin in his forthcoming television drama Whistle and I'll Come to You. Hordern, who had heard <b>positive</b> <b>things</b> of Miller from theatrical friends, likewise thought highly of the director, and was quick to take up location filming in Norfolk that year. [...] He came to like Miller's way of working, such as having the freedom to improvise instead of adhering to the strict rules of a script; the actor wrote in his autobiography that he had never experienced that degree of professional freedom. The programme was released towards the end of 1968 and was a hit with audiences and critics. Mark Duguid of the British Film Institute called it [...] "a masterpiece of economical horror that remains every bit as chilling as the day it was first broadcast", while a journalist for The Telegraph, writing in 2010 about that year's remake starring John Hurt, reminded readers of the [...] "brilliant Sixties production by Jonathan Miller [...] Michael Hordern made a fine, crusty Parkin". The year ended with a role in Peter Hall's production of Edward Albee's A Delicate Balance at the Aldwych Theatre. The piece received lukewarm reviews, with Hilary Spurling of The Spectator thinking Hordern was [...] "ill-served" [...] as the principal character, Tobias.|$|E

Hankinson, however, {{said he had never}} been [...] "floored" [...] by McGinty's voice, [...] "so both of his numbers fell extremely flat to me", and Futterman maintained that both songs were a [...] "weird fit" [...] for the episode, while Votta thought having him perform two solos was [...] "overkill on his character introduction". In general, [...] "Bein' Green" [...] was considered less impressive than [...] "Take Care of Yourself", though it had its supporters: Votta and Bell both referred to it as [...] "a nice introduction", and West declared that his [...] "simple, clear-voiced ode to being an outsider rang true and was hauntingly beautiful", and gave it an [...] "A−". Canning was not impressed: [...] "Perhaps if it had been sung with more feeling, it could have worked better." [...] For [...] "Take Care of Yourself", both West and Goldberg agreed with Rachel's assessment that the performance was [...] "magical", and West graded it with an [...] "A+". The Los Angeles Times Amy Reiter was [...] "blown away", and Chaney gave it an [...] "A" [...] with the comment that Rory [...] "handled it with adorable aplomb".

[...] Anyone who can create this much controversy within a week, I want to meet. I love people like that." [...] He observed that [...] "any song to do with the weekend annoys you. It reminds me of 'Saturday Night'... It's what we call a 'hair-dryer song,' a song girls sing into their hair dryers as they're getting ready to go out. But the fact that it's making people so angry is brilliant." [...] Cowell advised Black not to [...] "listen to anyone over the age of 18. I'm being deadly serious. Whatever she's done has worked. Whether you like her or not, she's the most talked-about artist in America right now. Nobody over the age of 18 should understand her or like her. So she should just do it her way." ...|$|E
