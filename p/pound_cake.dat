RF presented 33 % fat reduction. The increasing amaranth levels darkened crust and crumb of cakes, which decreased color acceptability. Fresh amaranth-containing cakes had similar texture characteristics to (he controls, evaluated both instrumentally and sensorially. Sensory evaluation revealed that replacement by 30 % amaranth flour decreased C cakes overall acceptability scores, clue to its lower specific volume and darker color. Amaranth flour levels had no significant effect on overall acceptability of RF cakes. Hence, the sum of wheat flour and corn starch could be successfully replaced by up to 20 % amaranth flour in C and up to 30 % in RF <b>pound</b> <b>cakes</b> without negatively affecting sensory quality in fresh cakes. Moisture losses for all the cakes were similar, approximate to 1 % per day during storage.

60|$|He {{belonged to}} a {{military}} company of big boys that had real wooden guns, such as the little boys never could get, and silk oil-cloth caps, and nankeen roundabouts, and white pantaloons with black stripes down the legs; and once they marched out to a boy's that had a father that had a farm, and he gave them all a free dinner in an arbor before the house: bread-and-butter, and apple-butter, and molasses and <b>pound</b> <b>cake,</b> and peaches and apples; it was splendid. When the excitement about the Mexican War was the highest, the company wanted a fort; and they got a farmer to come and scale off the sod with his plough, in a grassy place there was near a piece of woods, where a good many cows were pastured. They took the pieces of sod, and built them up into {{the walls of a}} fort about fifteen feet square; they intended to build them higher than their heads, but they got so eager to have the works stormed that they could not wait, and they commenced having the battle when they had the walls only breast high. There were going to be two parties: one to attack the fort, and the other to defend it, and they were just going to throw sods; but one boy had a real shot-gun, that he was to load up with powder and fire off when the battle got to the worst, so as to have it more like a battle. He thought it would be more like yet if he put in a few shot, and he did it on his own hook. It was a splendid gun, but it would not stand cocked long, and he was resting it {{on the wall of the}} fort, ready to fire when the storming-party came on, throwing sods and yelling and holloing; and all at once his gun went off, and a cow that was grazing broadside to the fort gave a frightened bellow, and put up her tail, and started for home. When they found out that the gun, if not the boy, had shot a cow, the Mexicans and Americans both took to their heels; and it was a good thing they did so, for as soon as that cow got home, and the owner found out by the blood on her that she had been shot, though it was only a very slight wound, he was so mad that he did not know what to do, and very likely he would have half killed those boys if he had caught them. He got a plough, and he went out to their fort, and he ploughed it all down flat, so that not one sod remained upon another.|$|E

Cakes containing whey protein isolate (WPI) solutions of varying concentrations (i. e. 20, 17 and 14 % w/v) were first prepared. Complete egg replacement by WPI led to the preparation of cake batter of increased specific gravity as well as to final cake products of inferior quality with regard to volume, texture and hardness increase upon storage, compared to the control. In the case of partial liquid egg replacement by WPI solutions, cakes with acceptable sensory and quality characteristics were obtained, which were further improved following the addition of emulsifiers. During a storage period of four days the egg-reduced cakes exhibited a significantly lower staling rate depending mainly on the concentration of WPI and the presence of emulsifiers. Finally, the analysis of cake microstructure confirmed the positive effect of the co-addition of whey proteins and emulsifiers in egg-reduced cakes. This work made it possible to develop an alternative, egg-reduced cake of satisfactory quality, by using a combination of whey proteins with two common baking additives...|$|R
