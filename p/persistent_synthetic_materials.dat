50|$|Biomimicry is the imitation, or mimicry, of {{biological}} systems, models, or structures, in synthetic areas. Oftentimes, biological materials can produce structures, that have properties and qualities far exceeding what <b>synthetic</b> <b>materials</b> can achieve. Biomimicry {{is being used}} to create comparable properties in <b>synthetic</b> <b>materials,</b> particularly in wettability and self-cleaning abilities of self-cleaning surfaces.|$|R
50|$|<b>Synthetic</b> <b>materials</b> {{also provide}} another method for tissue {{regeneration}} {{in which the}} graft's chemical and physical properties can be controlled. Since the properties of a material may be specified for {{the situation in which}} it is being used, <b>synthetic</b> <b>materials</b> are an attractive option for PNS regeneration. The use of <b>synthetic</b> <b>materials</b> come with certain concerns, such as: easy formation of the graft material into the necessary dimensions, biodegradable, sterilizable, tear resistant, easy to operate with, low risk of infection, and low inflammation response due to the material. The material must also maintain the channel during the nerve regeneration. Currently, the materials most commonly researched mainly focus on polyesters, but biodegradable polyurethane, other polymers, and biodegradable glass are also being investigated. Other possibilities for <b>synthetic</b> <b>materials</b> are conducting polymers and polymers biologically modified to promote cell axon growth and maintain the axon channel.|$|R

40|$|Developing bio-compatible smart {{materials}} that assemble {{in response to}} environmental cues requires strategies that can discriminate multiple specific stimuli in a complex milieu. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>materials</b> have yet to achieve this level of sensitivity, which would emulate the highly evolved and tailored reaction networks of complex biological systems. Here we show that the output of a naturally occurring network can be replaced with a <b>synthetic</b> <b>material.</b> Exploiting the blood coagulation system as an exquisite biological sensor, the fibrin clot end-product was replaced with a <b>synthetic</b> <b>material</b> under the biological control of a precisely regulated cross-linking enzyme. The functions of the coagulation network remained intact when the material was incorporated. Clot-like polymerization was induced in indirect response to distinct small molecules, phospholipids, enzymes, cells, viruses, an inorganic solid, a polyphenol, a polysaccharide, and a membrane protein. This strategy demonstrates {{for the first time}} that an existing stimulus-responsive biological network can be used to control the formation of a <b>synthetic</b> <b>material</b> by diverse classes of physiological triggers...|$|R

40|$|A {{discrete}} element {{approach was}} used in the simulation of rock fracture. The numerical <b>synthetic</b> <b>material</b> was made of rigid circular particles or cylinders that have interaction through normal and shear springs. The cylinders were bonded to each other at the contact points to withstand the applied loads. To characterize the microscopic properties of this <b>synthetic</b> <b>material,</b> a dimensional analysis approach was presented. It was shown that the dimensionless parameters and graphs obtained were useful tools for fast and efficient calibration of a <b>synthetic</b> <b>material.</b> This calibration method was employed for finding a numerical model for Pennsylvania Blue Sandstone. The numerical model could mimic many deformational and failure characteristics of the sandstone in both conventional and some non-conventional stress paths. Upprättat; 2007; 20081218 (tomvil...|$|R
