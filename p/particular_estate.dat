Characters are chased by avengers in masks, some of them experience some paranormal adventures.Today this formula has stopped being a novelty.

5000|$|Testamentary {{capacity}}Testamentary {{capacity is}} the mental capacity {{required to make}} a valid will. The current test comes from the decision in Banks v Goodfellow (1870).8 [...] This case concerned {{the validity of the}} will of John Banks. In modern terms he would most likely be described as a paranoid schizophrenic. He suffered from delusions that he was being persecuted by devils (they were sometimes visible to him) and also by a deceased local grocer. His will was challenged on the basis that he was insane and therefore unable to make a will.9 [...] The will was found to be valid after trial by jury, before Brett J, at Cumberland Spring Assizes in 1869. On appeal, this judgment was confirmed unanimously by a panel of four appeal judges in Queen’s Bench. The will was found to be valid, not influenced by his delusions, and deemed rational, being in favour of his only close relative (who also lived with him). In a strong and eloquent judgment, Cockburn CJ set out the following test of the capacity to make a valid will, which still applied in many Anglophone jurisdictions today:“It is essential to the exercise of such a power that a testator shall understand the nature of the act and its effects; shall understand the extent of the property of which he is disposing; shall be able to comprehend and appreciate the claims to which he ought to give effect; and, with a view to the latter object, that no disorder of the mind shall poison his affections, pervert his sense of right, or prevent the exercise of his natural faculties—that no insane delusion shall influence his will in disposing of his property and bring about a disposal of it which, if the mind had been sound, would not have been made.” 10 [...] This remains the test today, notwithstanding the Mental Capacity Act 2005.11It is now considered as being composed of four distinct elements and that understanding is required of1 the nature of the act of making a will and its effect2 the extent of the property that is to be disposed of3 the claims of family or friendship to which he ought to give effectand as a separate element12 [...] 4 that no disorder of the mind shall poison his affections, pervert his sense of right, or prevent the exercise of his natural faculties—that no insane delusion shall influence his will in disposing of his property and bring about a disposal of it which, if the mind had been sound, would not have been made.In addition, the original wording, 1, 2 and 3 are all approached as not requiring actual understanding, but instead being capable of understanding [...]13As this is a common law test created by judges, it is capable of being modified by judges, as they see fit in the light of modern circumstances. Modern psychiatric knowledge has allowed the test to be developed by having a further element added and that is for the testator to be capable of exercising his decision-making powers.14 This test is focussed on the ability of the particular individual and his <b>particular</b> <b>estate.</b> The outcome is always unique to the particular facts. Where the circumstances and assets of a testator are simple or straightforward the level of capacity required will be lower than that for the testator with complex circumstances and assets.15 ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the leisure and recreation activities {{and experiences of}} people living in urban residential estates in the Lower Hunter, New South Wales. Drawing on data collected in household surveys of residents aged 14 years and over in four residential estates, this paper profiles the respondents themselves, describes their leisure preferences and activities, and explains how they felt about how they experienced the leisure and recreation spaces and settings within, and adjacent to, their residential estates. The findings revealed that although {{the quantity and quality of}} recreation resources varied among the estates, some common themes emerged among respondents with respect to their leisure and recreation needs, perceptions, and demand. In particular, substantial numbers of respondents in each estate expressed dissatisfaction with recreation resource provision. There was an expressed need for larger areas of open space and parkland, and better facilities for a wider range of age groups. The authors concluded that leisure and recreation planning for urban residential estates is generally ad hoc and at best standards based, and characterised by the reproduction of familiar but inadequate leisure and play spaces.
