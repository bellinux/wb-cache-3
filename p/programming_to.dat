5|$|In May 2014, Sinclair {{disclosed}} in an FCC filling {{that it was}} unable to find buyers for the three affected stations, requiring changes to its transaction. In Harrisburg, Sinclair chose to retain WHP-TV, and divest WHTM to Media General. However, in Charleston and Birmingham, the company proposed to shut down stations entirely (rather than selling them to other buyers that would also handle their operational responsibilities) so it could maintain legal duopolies; surrendering the licenses for WCIV and the full-powered repeaters of WBMA-LD (WJSU and WCFT), and moving their ABC <b>programming</b> <b>to</b> Sinclair's existing stations WMMP and WABM respectively – which would shift their existing MyNetworkTV <b>programming</b> <b>to</b> digital subchannels. After nearly a year of delays, Sinclair's deal to acquire Allbritton was approved by the FCC on July 24, 2014.|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, Sinclair {{informed}} the FCC {{that it was}} unable to find buyers for WABM or WMMP – the company's MyNetworkTV stations in Birmingham, Alabama and Charleston, South Carolina that it planned to sell in its purchase of Allbritton Communications. In Birmingham, the company proposed surrendering the licenses of WCFT-TV and WJSU-TV – the two full-powered satellites of ABC affiliate WBMA-LD, converting WABM into a full-powered satellite of WBMA-LD – and moving its existing MyNetworkTV <b>programming</b> <b>to</b> a digital subchannel of WABM (although the WBMA-LD simulcast was placed on WABM's subchannel instead while MyNetworkTV programming was retained on its main channel). Similarly, in Charleston, Sinclair planned to surrender WCIV's license and move its ABC affiliation and <b>programming</b> <b>to</b> WMMP. In both cases, Sinclair believed that its own stations had superior technical facilities than those of the stations it intends to surrender. Sinclair was able to retain WBMA-LD in any event as the FCC does not impose any ownership limits on low-power stations.|$|E

Giordano, Parker and Ted Young mixed the recordings, and Ted Jensen did the mastering; Mike Sapone contributed <b>programming</b> <b>to</b> the songs. Girl Next Door String Quartet provided the strings, arranged by conductor Ray Zu-Artez (who played piano). Neil Rubenstein of These Enzymes and Nick Torres of Northstar contributed vocals to some songs. In retrospect, Fred Mascherino considered the sessions rushed.|$|E

5|$|The Latino {{community}} was deeply {{affected by the}} news of Selena's death; some people traveled thousands of miles to visit her home, boutiques, and the crime scene, while churches with large congregations of Latinos held prayers in her name. All major television networks in the United States interrupted their regular <b>programming</b> <b>to</b> break the news. The public's reaction to Selena's death was compared to those that followed the deaths of John Lennon, Elvis Presley, and John F. Kennedy. Some Americans who were unaware of the singer and her popularity criticized the attention she and her murder received from both {{the media and the}} Latino community. Radio personality Howard Stern mocked Selena's murder, burial, and her mourners and criticized her music, playing her songs with gunshots in the background, causing an uproar among the Latino population. On April 12, 1995—two weeks after her death—then-Texas governor George W. Bush declared her birthday Selena Day in Texas. Some Americans were offended because Selena Day that year coincided with Easter.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons {{uses the}} {{standard}} setup of a situational comedy, or sitcom, as its premise. The series {{centers on a}} family and their life in a typical American town, serving as a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle.

The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant, the show can comment {{on the state of the}} environment. Through Bart and Lisa's days at Springfield Elementary School, the show's writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education.

5|$|Channel 4's {{coverage}} of the Games was billed as the most extensive Paralympic coverage ever broadcast in the United Kingdom; it promised over 150 hours of live coverage throughout the Games on Channel 4 and sister channel More4, and additional coverage online and through special channels carried by Freesat, Sky and Virgin TV (in both standard and high definition). The broadcaster also invested around £600,000 towards training new on-air personalities with expertise in disability sports for the Games, {{many of whom were}} disabled themselves—they would also be joined by Channel 4 News anchor Jon Snow, and BBC Sport personality Clare Balding. Channel 4 also broadcast supplemental <b>programming</b> <b>to</b> lead towards the Games, such as Paralympic-focused documentaries, other IPC championships, and That Paralympic Show, a weekly program focusing on disability sports. During the Games, comedian Adam Hills (who himself was born without a right leg, and hosted the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's {{coverage of}} the Beijing Paralympics) would host The Last Leg, a Paralympic-themed late night talk show that followed the conclusion of each night's coverage. Channel 4's {{coverage of the}} Games drew relatively high viewership; its coverage of the opening ceremony was seen by an average of 7.6 million viewers, a 40% share, and peaked at 11.2 million viewers—making it one of Channel 4's most-watched programmes in network history. Primetime coverage saw an average of 3.3 million viewers nightly, while viewership peaked at 4.5 million viewers during the men's T44 200m final where Alan Oliveira beat Oscar Pistorius for the gold medal.

5|$|Emsleyan or Mertensian mimicry {{describes}} unusual {{cases where}} deadly prey mimic a less dangerous species. It was first proposed by Emsley {{as a possible}} answer for the theoretical difficulties a predator species faces when associating an aposematic phenotype of potentially dangerous animals, such as the coral snake, with unprofitability when the predator has {{an increased risk of}} death, negating any learned behaviour. The theory was developed by the German biologist Wolfgang Wickler in a chapter of Mimicry in Plants and Animals, who named it after the German herpetologist Robert Mertens. Sheppard points out that Hecht and Marien put forward a similar hypothesis ten years earlier. This scenario is a little more difficult to understand, since in other types of mimicry it is usually the most harmful species that is the model. But if a predator dies, it cannot learn to recognize a warning signal, e.g., bright colours in a certain pattern. In other words, there is no advantage in being aposematic for an organism that is likely to kill any predator it succeeds in poisoning; such an animal is better off being camouflaged, to avoid attacks altogether. If, however, there were some other species that were harmful but not deadly as well as aposematic, the predator could learn to recognize its particular warning colours and avoid such animals. A deadly species could then profit by mimicking the less dangerous aposematic organism if this reduces the number of attacks. The exception here, ignoring any chance of animals learning by watching a conspecific die (see Jouventin et al. for a discussion of observational learning and mimicry), is the possibility of not having to learn that it is harmful in the first place: instinctive genetic <b>programming</b> <b>to</b> be wary of certain signals. In this case, other organisms could benefit from this programming, and Batesian or Müllerian mimics of it could potentially evolve. In fact, {{it has been shown that}} some species do have an innate recognition of certain aposematic warnings. Hand-reared turquoise-browed motmots (Eumomota superciliosa), avian predators, instinctively avoid snakes with red and yellow rings. Other colours with the same pattern, and even red and yellow stripes with the same width as rings, were tolerated. However, models with red and yellow rings were feared, with the birds flying away and giving alarm calls in some cases. This provides an alternative explanation to Mertensian mimicry. See Greene and McDiarmid for a review of the subject.|$|E
