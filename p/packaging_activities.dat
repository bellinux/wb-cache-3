If RFID technology is to be implemented in packaging throughout retail supply chains, {{there is a need}} to develop an understanding of how and why the technology affects activities and processes within retail supply chains. Accordingly, the overall purpose of this licentiate thesis is to explore how the application of RFID technology to packaging could affect <b>packaging</b> logistics <b>activities</b> in retail supply chains. The <b>packaging</b> logistics <b>activities</b> discussed in this licentiate thesis are those related to ambient fast-moving consumer goods, from the product-filling point at the manufacturer’s, where the product is merged with the primary packaging, to the point of sale at retail outlets, where the products are sold to the end consumer. This thesis is based on multiple research strategies; a case study and a modelling and simulation study. The case study was conducted to describe and gain an in-depth understanding of and insight into existing <b>packaging</b> logistics <b>activities</b> in retail supply chains. A Dutch retail supply chain was chosen as a single-case study. The single-case study was both data-triangulated and investigator-triangulated with three Swedish case studies to further broaden the understanding of <b>packaging</b> logistics <b>activities</b> in retail supply chains. The case study resulted in a framework of <b>packaging</b> logistics <b>activities</b> in retail supply chains.

40|$|Packaging {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} activities in the distribution systems and supply chains. Nevertheless, it attracts little attention of people, especially in the manufacturing sector because packaging has been intensively used as a protective agent only. One of the prime factors that inhibit manufacturing efficiency and productivity is treating <b>packaging</b> <b>activities</b> as an individual task. In other words, traditional packaging is usually considered as a cost driven center rather than a value added component throughout the manufacturing and distribution processes. If we reconsider the packaging design in a systematic approach, it is easy to develop more cost effective solutions for manufacturing processing that can support handling and distribution as well as providing protection of the product. By the same token, it will bring additional values to a company because of the improvement in manufacturing and distribution efficiency. The aim of the paper is to review and reorganize the major functions and roles of the packaging played in the manufacturing and logistics system and suggest a methodology for a systematic approach to packaging logistics. The proposed approach is demonstrated through a case study. How to transform an existing packaging system to the proposed one is also suggested. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|With this article, {{we aim to}} {{contribute}} to a growing academic and public debate on claims about ‘taking a gap year’ as (an act of) moral tourism, a means of self-development and ultimately resulting in global citizenship. More specifically, we examined how the gap year discourse is exhibited, influenced and shaped through the representation, promotion and construction of gap year <b>packages</b> and <b>activities</b> on websites operated by providers in the Netherlands. Informed by Bourdieu’s model of capital accumulation, we conducted a content analysis of websites operated by providers of gap year <b>packages</b> and <b>activities</b> in the Netherlands. Findings show that narratives about gap years primarily focus on positive and personal (future) benefits of accumulating skills and self-development to potential gappers, and in some cases to their parents. The gap year is represented as a commercial product that allows one to explore the world and the Self. The findings also showed that although Dutch providers promote the gap year product as ethical, emphasis is placed primarily on the ‘ethical’ benefits for the gapper himself or herself.

40|$|AbstractA {{sensitive}} and efficient {{system for the}} functional assay of antisense oligonucleotides (oligos) was developed based on an in vitro viral assembly system. A 120 -base RNA (pRNA), which indispensably participates in bacteriophage φ 29 DNA packaging, was the target for antisense action. Antisense oligos bound to pRNA, as revealed by a slower electrophoretic mobility of pRNA/oligo complexes in comparison with native pRNA. Infectious viruses were assembled in vitro with synthetic pRNA and DNA, {{as well as with}} viral proteins produced from cloned genes. Up to 107 plaque-forming units per milliliter were obtained in the absence of antisense oligos, while as few as zero plaques were detected in the presence of certain antisense oligos. A 1 -base mismatch greatly influenced the inhibitory effect of the antisense oligos, but this 1 -based mismatch was not important when the mismatch was placed {{at the end of the}} oligo. Five oligos did not bind pRNA or inhibit the assembly of the virion, suggesting that the RNA sequences complementary to these oligos are nonessential or buried internally in the RNA. Viral assembly was strongly inhibited by antisense oligos P 15 and P 10, targeting either the 5 ′- or the 3 ′-end of the pRNA, respectively. Viral assembly was also strongly inhibited by oligo P 6, targeting an internal region, residues 75 - 91, of pRNA. Oligo P 6 inhibited DNA <b>packaging</b> <b>activity</b> by blocking the binding of pRNA to the procapsid, while P 10 and P 15 inhibited DNA <b>packaging</b> <b>activity</b> but did not block the binding of pRNA to the procapsid, suggesting that in addition to the reported internal domain for procapsid binding, pRNA contains another domain at the paired 5 ′/ 3 ′-ends with a yet to be defined role in DNA translocation...|$|R

40|$|The global company {{operates}} from {{a number}} of locations worldwide, which entails geographical distances and logistical implications for product and parts transported, as well as the choice of product variety because of numerable worldwide consumer preferences. In these companies, packaging becomes a frequently used object to complement product features and achieve an effective and efficient means of transportation. In this context, it is interesting to integrate packaging development in the product development process to improve development decisions on e. g. manufacturing, assembly and distribution, and also to reduce repeated changes in product design and other development processes. To corroborate these thoughts, the overall objective for this thesis is to explore the potential of improving resource utilisation in the development of product and packaging by an integrated development of product and packaging. In three surveys in Swedish mechanical, pharmaceutical and food industries, which account for approximately 74 % of all packaged products produced in Sweden, the potential for the concept was explored and positively validated. By comparisons across survey results and additional information provided by literature reviews of mechanical, pharmaceutical and food product development, the possibility of introducing integrated product and packaging development into an integrated procedure model has been established. Note that the packaging developer’s perspective is excluded in this thesis. Duc to extensive diversity in composition and organisation for product development across the product areas surveyed, an integrated product and packaging procedure model is heavily dependent upon product area. For the integration of product and packaging it is (1) important to include packaging in the product mission statement, (2) preferable to consider the function decomposition of product and packaging when specifying the product and (3) beneficial to also decide upon packaging hierarchy and packaging materials when deciding on detailed product systems and subsystems. Note that when the product area is known, relevant methods and techniques for the integration of product and <b>packaging</b> <b>activities</b> on an operational leve 1 in the procedure model may be developed Future research should implement a preliminary suggestion into {{one or more of the}} surveyed product areas’ product development activities to achieve a final and verified integrated product and packaging development procedure model...|$|E
