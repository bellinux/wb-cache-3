5000|$|Discretion is {{not always}} being used {{correctly}} despite being a specific requirement of <b>penalty</b> <b>fares</b> schemes. There are, for example, cases of disabled people <b>penalty</b> <b>fares</b> when clearly {{it should not have}} happened.|$|R
50|$|The London Regional Transport (<b>Penalty</b> <b>Fares)</b> Act 1992 and the Greater London Authority Act 1999 allows Transport for London {{to charge}} <b>penalty</b> <b>fares</b> under similar but not {{identical}} rules {{to those on}} National Rail services.|$|R
50|$|Travellers issued with <b>penalty</b> <b>fares</b> {{which they}} {{believe to be}} unfair may appeal the fare within 21 days to an appeal service, which varies {{depending}} on the mode of transport. For National Rail services this is the Independent <b>Penalty</b> <b>Fares</b> Appeal Service which is run by Southeastern Trains Ltd.|$|R

25|$|Historically, {{standard}} Gatwick Express services did {{not charge}} <b>penalty</b> <b>fares</b> and permitted tickets to be purchased on board at no extra charge. Journeys {{to or from}} stations south of Gatwick were subject to <b>penalty</b> <b>fares</b> as normal. This rule applied to the six weekday services each way that start or end at Brighton.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to automatic and staffed faregates at stations, the Underground also operates on a proof-of-payment system. The system is patrolled by both uniformed and plain-clothes fare inspectors with hand-held Oyster-card readers. Passengers travelling without a valid ticket must pay a <b>penalty</b> <b>fare</b> of £80 (or £40 if paid within 21days) {{and can be}} prosecuted for fare evasion under the Regulation of Railways Act 1889 and Transport for London Byelaws.|$|E
25|$|If {{the claim}} is {{accepted}} then the maximum Oyster fare minus {{the cost of the}} journey will be refunded. The user will be asked to nominate and make a journey from a specific Tube, DLR, London Overground or National Rail station, or Tram stop. On touching in or out, the refund is loaded to the card. The only way to collect a refund is as part of an actual journey, otherwise a further <b>penalty</b> <b>fare</b> is charged. This is because when the passenger touches the reader with their Oyster card, not only will the refund go on to the card, but a new journey will start.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, several DM/D {{units were}} reintroduced on peak {{services}} as an interim measure until the Matangi units arrived. Six SE BR Mark 2 carriages were partially refurbished and introduced for express peak services, top-and-tailed by two refurbished EO class electric locomotives. The locomotives, built in 1968, {{were used in}} the Otira Tunnel until its de-electrification in 1997. An additional locomotive was refurbished for backup. Due to mechanical issues and the availability of new rolling stock, the EOs were withdrawn from service in 2011. Slower-than-planned commissioning of the Matangi units and the unreliability of the EO locomotives saw Melling line services temporarily replaced by buses in April 2013 and the permanent removal of the <b>penalty</b> <b>fare</b> for Hutt Valley passengers on the Wairarapa Connection in the southbound direction. On the Johnsonville line in 2012, from 7 February until the introduction of the Matangi trains from 19 March, some peak period trains were replaced by buses because of a shortage of DM/D units.|$|E
50|$|<b>Penalty</b> <b>fares</b> {{cannot be}} issued in some circumstances, including: if {{passengers}} {{were unable to}} purchase a ticket due to faulty ticket machines or closed ticket offices, if warning notices are not displayed correctly, if the train or station is excluded from a <b>penalty</b> <b>fares</b> scheme, or if the National Rail Conditions of Carriage allow an excess fare to be paid.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Penalty</b> <b>fares</b> further complicate {{an already}} complex system of <b>fares</b> and <b>penalties,</b> and as not all TOCs have <b>penalty</b> <b>fares</b> schemes, they mean that ticketless {{passengers}} are treated differently {{according to which}} trains they are on. There are examples of trains run by different companies operating over the same stretch of route but having different policies in place for ticketless passengers.|$|R
50|$|Passengers {{without a}} valid ticket {{boarding}} a train at a station where ticket-buying facilities are available {{are required to}} pay the full Open Single or Return fare. On some services <b>penalty</b> <b>fares</b> apply - a ticketless passenger may be charged the greater of £20 or twice the full single fare to the next stop. <b>Penalty</b> <b>Fares</b> can be collected only by authorised Revenue Protection Inspectors, not by ordinary Guards.|$|R
2500|$|The {{system is}} part of the London fare zone system, and Travelcards that cover the {{appropriate}} zones are valid. There are one-day and season DLR-only [...] "Rover" [...] tickets, plus a one-day DLR [...] "Rail and River Rover" [...] ticket for the DLR and City Cruises river boats. Oyster pay-as-you-go is also available; or NFC enabled bank card holders (contactless) passengers need to touch both in and out on the platform readers or pass through the automatic gates. Tickets can be purchased from ticket machines {{at the entrance to the}} platforms, and are required before entering the platform. There are no ticket barriers at DLR-only stations, and correct ticketing is enforced by random on-train inspections by the PSA. Passengers without a correct ticket, pay-as-you-go Oyster users or a contactless bank card who have failed to touch in at the start of the journey may be liable to a £80 <b>penalty</b> <b>fare</b> or prosecution for fare evasion. There are barriers at Bank, , Woolwich Arsenal, West Ham and , where the DLR platforms are within a London Underground or National Rail barrier line.|$|E
50|$|<b>Penalty</b> <b>fare</b> schemes {{in local}} {{transport}} (suburban rail, buses, underground trains) are administered by local transport authorities (Verkehrsverbund). The <b>penalty</b> <b>fare</b> is usually €60 or twice the ticket price (whichever is higher).|$|E
50|$|In Moscow Oblast, the <b>penalty</b> <b>fare</b> is 1000 rubles. On railways, the <b>penalty</b> <b>fare</b> will be {{increased}} to fifty times the 10 km fare, plus the fare {{from the previous}} station to named station.|$|E
5000|$|... 2016, SWR, another public broadcaster, {{reported}} that Arvato Infoscore handles {{the collection of}} <b>penalty</b> <b>fares</b> for Deutsche Bahn. As part of this, information about travelers is passed without their knowledge. The lawyer Karl-Nikolaus Peifer classified this process as a breach of data protection and fair-trade laws. The SWR also provided evidence that Arvato Infoscore had used information from such <b>penalty</b> <b>fares</b> for credit ratings of some customers, too.|$|R

50|$|During June-July 2009, an {{automatic}} ticket machine was {{installed on the}} Derby-bound platform. This enables passengers to buy tickets (or collect those purchased in advance) before they board. In December 2009, Belper became a <b>Penalty</b> <b>fare</b> station. The <b>penalty</b> <b>fare</b> applies for any southbound travel or on northbound mainline services. Ambergate to Matlock {{is not part of}} the <b>penalty</b> <b>fare</b> scheme. Where the local authority provides a discount, if the vending machine is unable to issue them, they are then bought on the train. The notices at the station, however, give the impression that penalty fares are applicable to all destinations.|$|E

50|$|<b>Penalty</b> <b>fares</b> are fares {{issued for}} {{passengers}} without valid tickets; standard fare {{is a term}} with similar meaning. In the United Kingdom, certain Train Operating Companies, such as South Western Railway and Southern, have Revenue Protection Inspectors who can issue <b>penalty</b> <b>fares</b> to passengers who travel without a valid ticket. This is currently a minimum of £20 or twice the single fare for the journey made. In Canada, the Toronto Transit Commission charges $500 for people evading the $3 fare.|$|R
