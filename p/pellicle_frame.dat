40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} an optical quality membrane mirror with aberrations smaller than the correction limit of an adaptive optical mirror. The shape is generated by a pressure difference. A small overview about historical and state-of-the-art membrane mirrors is given. Hencky’s respec-tively Campbell’s approximations are the most used theories for describing the deformation of a thin membrane subjected to uniform pressure. The main wavefront error is spherical aberration. Shape correction is possible by varying design-parameters or by using adaptive optical systems. Suitable materials are polyester and polyimide. A solar safety film is used for our membrane mirrors. Mechanical and optical properties were determined with experiments. Because the prototype DLR-AOS per-formed poorly, the influence of the initial tension was analyzed. The component creating this tension was replaced by a more satisfying <b>pellicle</b> <b>frame</b> adjustable in 5 axes. The point spread function im-proved significantly. A flexible experimental setup for measuring the deviation from a reference sphere with interference respectively Shack-Hartmann-sensor was designed. Integration of the adap-tive mirror is prepared. The wavefront deviation is within 10 λ (λ = 633 nm) and very smooth. 6 λ are achievable by adjusting the <b>pellicle</b> <b>frame.</b> The dominant wavefront errors are astigmatism and coma caused by non-ideal boundary condition...|$|E
40|$|Pellicle {{is defined}} as a thin {{transparent}} film stretched over an aluminum (Al) frame that is glued on one side of a photomask. As semiconductor devices are pursuing higher levels of integration and higher resolution patterns, the cleaning of the Al flame surface is becoming a critical step because the contaminants on the Al flame can cause lithography exposure defects on the wafers. In order to remove these contaminants from the Al frame, a highly concentrated nitric acid (HNO 3) solution is used. However, it is difficult to fully remove them, which results in an increase in the Al surface roughness. In this paper, the <b>pellicle</b> <b>frame</b> cleaning is investigated using various cleaning solutions. When the mixture of sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4), hydrofluoric acid (HF), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), and deionized water with ultrasonic is used, a high cleaning efficiency is achieved without HNO 3. Thus, this cleaning process is suitable for Al frame cleaning and it can also reduce the use of chemicals.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of 157 nm {{as the next}} optical lithography wavelength has created a need for new soft (polymeric) or hard (quartz) pellicle materials optimized for this wavelength. Materials design and development of ultra transparent fluoropolymers suitable for 157 nm soft pellicle applications has produced a number of promising candidate materials with absorbances below 0. 03 /µm as is necessary to achieve pellicle transmissions above 95 %. We have developed 12 families of experimental TeflonAF ® (TAFx) materials which have sufficient transparency to produce transmissions above 95 %. For the successful fabrication of 157 nm pellicles from these materials, the fluoropolymers must have appropriate physical properties to permit the spin coating of thin polymer films and their lifting and adhesive mounting to <b>pellicle</b> <b>frames,</b> the processes which produce free standing pellicle membranes of micron scale thickness. Relevant physical properties include molecular weight, glass transition temperature, and mechanical strength and toughness. We have successfully developed various of the ultra transparent TAFx polymer families with these physical properties. Upon irradiation these 157 nm pellicle polymers undergo photochemical darkening, which reduces the 157 nm transmission of the material. Measurements of the photochemical darkening rate allow the estimation of the pellicle lifetime corresponding to a 10 % drop in 157 nm transmission. Increasing the 157 nm lifetime of fluoropolymers involves simultaneous optimization of the materials, the pellicles and the end use. Similar optimization was essential to achieve the desired radiation durability lifetimes for pellicles successfully developed for use with KrF (248 nm) and ArF (193 nm) lithography...|$|R
40|$|An {{assessment}} of the mechanical performance of pellicles from different vendors was performed. Pellicle-induced distortions were experimentally measured and numerical simulations were run to predict what improvements were desirable. The experiments included mask registration measurements before and after pellicle mounting for three of the major pellicle suppliers, and adhesive gasket material properties characterization for previously untested samples. The finite element numerical simulations were verified via comparison to experimental data for <b>pellicles</b> with known <b>frame</b> bows, measured by the vendor. The models were extended to simulate {{the effect of the}} chucking of reticles in an exposure tool, as well as the various magnification correction schemes available in such tools. Results were compared to ITRS requirements to evaluate performances. This study enables the AMTC to give important feedback to pellicle suppliers and make proper recommendations to customers for future pellicle choices...|$|R
