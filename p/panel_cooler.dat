40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} numerically the human thermal response that 24 students and 1 teacher feel in a classroom equipped with radiant cooling systems and subjected to uniform convective environments, in lightly warm conditions. The evolution of thermal comfort conditions, using the PMV index, is made by the multi-nodal human thermal comfort model. In this numerical model, that works in transient or steady-state conditions and simulates simultaneously a group of persons, the three-dimensional body is divided in 24 cylindrical and 1 spherical elements. Each element is divided in four parts (core, muscle, fat and skin), sub-divided in several layers, and protected by several clothing layers. This numerical model is divided in six parts: human body thermal system, clothing thermal system, integral equations resolution system, thermoregulatory system, heat exchange between {{the body and the}} environment and thermal comfort evaluation. Seven different radiant systems are combined to three convective environments. In the radiant systems (1) no radiant system without warmed curtain, (2) no radiant system with warmed curtain, (3) radiant floors cooling system with warmed curtain, (4) radiant <b>panels</b> <b>cooling</b> system with warmed curtain, (5) radiant ceiling cooling system with warmed curtain, (6) radiant floor and <b>panels</b> <b>cooling</b> system with warmed curtain and (7) radiant ceiling and <b>panels</b> <b>cooling</b> system with warmed curtain are analysed, while in the convective environments (1) without air velocity field and with uniform air velocity field of (2) 0. 2 m/s and (3) 0. 6 m/s are also analysed. The internal air temperature and internal surfaces temperature are 28 degrees C, the radiant cooling surfaces temperature are 19 degrees C and the warmed internal curtains surfaces temperatures, subjected to direct solar radiation, are 40 degrees C. The numerical model calculates the Mean Radiant Temperature field, the human bodies' temperatures field and the thermal comfort level, for the 25 occupants, for the 21 analysed situations. Without uniform air velocity field, when only one individual radiant cooling system is used, the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied people is lowest when the radiant floor cooling system is applied and is highest when the radiant <b>panel</b> <b>cooling</b> system is applied. When are combined the radiant ceiling or the floor cooling systems with the radiant <b>panel</b> <b>cooling</b> system the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied people decreases. When the uniform air velocity increases the thermal comfort level, that the occupants are subjected, increases. When the radiant floor cooling system or the combination of radiant floor and <b>panel</b> <b>cooling</b> systems without uniform air velocity field is applied, the Category C is verified for some occupants. However, with a convective uniform air velocity field of 0. 2 m/s the Category B is verified and with a convective uniform air velocity field of 0. 6 m/s the Category A is verify for some occupants. In the last situation the Category C is verified, in general, for all occupants. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A <b>panel</b> {{system for}} <b>cooling</b> {{buildings}} is proposed, {{working with an}} absorption-refrigeration unit, the evaporator {{of which is the}} panel itself. Trifluoroethanol (TFE) and N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) are proposed as refrigerant and absorbent, respectively. Use of the TFE-NMP mixture seems to offer advantages over the usual H 2 O-LiBr or NH 3 -H 2 O mixtures, and suits well the modest refrigeration temperatures needed in <b>panel</b> <b>cooling.</b> Analytical expressions are presented for the properties of the TFE-NMP mixture and a calculation procedure for NH 3 -H 2 O units is used after suitable modifications to simulate the operation of the TFE-NMP absorption-refrigeration unit.

40|$|In <b>panel</b> <b>cooling</b> of buildings, {{the heat}} {{produced}} within or inserted {{into a room}} is received by a cold fluid flowing through pipes fitted in {{the ceiling of the}} room. With such systems, considerable energy savings may be obtained because higher cooling temperatures are adequate owing to the available large cooling surfaces and the radiative heat exchange between people's heads and ceiling. Moreover cool storage within structural elements may decrease peak loads. The <b>panel</b> <b>cooling</b> system examined here uses a solar driven H 2 O/LiBr absorption refrigeration unit. A thermodynamic and thermal analysis of the whole system is carried out and the expected performance is predicted for operation during the typical summer in Athens using local climatological data. Because of the very high evaporation temperatures (up to 18 °C), the theoretical coefficient of performance of the H 2 O/LiBr unit is much higher than that obtained in usual refrigeration applications, i. e. it reaches 94 % with specific cooling capacity 2410 - 2450 kJ/kg H 2 O. For ratio of the panel to the solar collector areas equal to 2, the <b>panel</b> <b>cooling</b> power reaches at noon a value of 200 W/m 2 and therefore the proposed system seems to be sufficient for the usual building-cooling needs in Greece.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to design and investigate a radiant <b>panel</b> <b>cooling</b> system on small scale building type (office) under the central Sudan climatic conditions so as to explore the benefits of radiant cooling systems over conventional air conditioning systems (VAV systems). Transient heat conduction of building (finite difference method) was used to evaluate the simulation model. The computer program (Matlab) was used to calculate transient heat flow through the walls and ceiling (variable loads) of the conditioned space. Other heat loads of the conditioned space were determined by the standard ASHRAE method. After the cooling load was calculated, the cooling system (radiant <b>cooling</b> <b>panel</b> system) was designed. This system consists of four (1. 3 m x 1. 05 m) panels made out of aluminum sheet metal and was installed on the ceiling of the conditioned space (4. 22 m x 2 m x 3. 05 m). Each panel consists of thirteen serpentine copper tubes fixed down {{on one side of the}} sheet and insulated with fiberglass at the back of the other side to prevent heat gains from the plenum. The experimental verification was achieved by using a cooling system which consists of a water chiller unit, fan coil unit (ducted fan coil unit) and radiant <b>cooling</b> <b>panels.</b> The duration of the experimental work took around one month (from 19 th September to 21 ist October 2006). Tests were conducted every day starting from 8 am up to 4 pm. In these tests four time intervals are selected for data recording (10 am, 12 pm, 2 pm and 4 pm) to evaluate the validity of the radiant <b>cooling</b> <b>panel</b> system. The experimental results showed that the ceiling radiant <b>cooling</b> <b>panel</b> system with dedicated outdoor air system saves power demand of 21 % and 35. 3 % of VAV system in case if recirculation air and 100 % VII fresh air are used in each respectively.

Finally, the ceiling radiant <b>cooling</b> <b>panel</b> system has great advantages to improve human comfort and to save power demand when compared with VAV system. This system was found to be very suitable for a hot and arid environment (Khartoum) as shown in this investigation due to the fact that Sudan with its tropical and continental location is considered one of the hottest and arid regions in the world.

50|$|Drywall is made {{primarily}} from gypsum (CaSO4•2H2O). As its chemical formula shows, gypsum contains chemically combined water (approximately 50% by volume). When gypsum panels {{are exposed to}} fire, heat is absorbed as {{a portion of the}} combined water is driven off as steam. This chemical process is called calcination. The thermal energy that converts the water to steam is thus diverted and absorbed, keeping {{the opposite side of the}} gypsum <b>panels</b> <b>cool</b> as long as there is crystalline water left to be converted into steam or until the gypsum panel is breached. In the case of regular gypsum board, as the crystalline water is driven off, the reduction of volume within the gypsum core causes large cracks to form, eventually causing the panel to fail due to loss of structural integrity. This is similar to the cracking that can be observed in a dry lake or river bed.|$|R

In recent years phase change materials (PCM) have been extensively researched in different application areas, starting from product packaging and clothing to wide variety of applications within the buildings for temperature fluctuation reduction. In most cases PCM are used to achieve effective passive cooling by enhancing the thermal capacity and thermal inertia of buildings who are made of lightweight constructions. These systems although are effective for temperature fluctuation reduction, they don’t provide comfortable indoor climatic conditions, because often too high temperatures are reached and additional cooling loads need to be operated to overcome this shortcoming. To achieve more comfortable indoor climate conditions and to lower the indoor temperature a mathematical model is developed to examine the phase change temperature influence on the temperature profile on the ceiling panel surface. ...|$|R
