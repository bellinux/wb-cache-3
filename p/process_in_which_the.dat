5|$|Some insects use parthenogenesis, a <b>process</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> female can {{reproduce}} {{and give}} birth {{without having the}} eggs fertilized by a male. Many aphids undergo a form of parthenogenesis, called cyclical parthenogenesis, in which they alternate between one or many generations of asexual and sexual reproduction. In summer, aphids are generally female and parthenogenetic; in the autumn, males may be produced for sexual reproduction. Other insects produced by parthenogenesis are bees, wasps and ants, in which they spawn males. However, overall, most individuals are female, which are produced by fertilization. The males are haploid and the females are diploid. More rarely, some insects display hermaphroditism, in which a given individual has {{both male and female}} reproductive organs.|$|E

5|$|After passing his exam, Woodruff {{entered his}} {{position}} at Sheffield, where he trained in emergency and elective surgery. Originally, {{he had planned}} to do surgical research, but Sheffield had no space for him in its surgical lab. Instead, Woodruff was given a place in the pathology laboratory where he studied transplant rejection, a <b>process</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> immune system of a transplant recipient attacks the transplanted tissue. Woodruff was particularly interested in thyroid allografts to the anterior chamber of the eye because they did not appear to meet with rejection. Woodruff's work with the allografts gave him a solid basis to work in the developing field of transplantion and rejection. To further himself in these areas, Woodruff arranged to meet Peter Medawar, an eminent zoologist and important pioneer in the study of rejection. The two men discussed transplantation and rejection, beginning a lasting professional relationship. Despite his achievements at Sheffield, Woodruff was rejected upon applying for a post at the Royal Melbourne Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Apoptosis is a {{controlled}} <b>process</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in {{death of the}} cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and {{the disintegration of the}} nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.|$|E
5|$|Congress also {{proposed}} the Fourteenth Amendment to the states. Written by Trumbull and others, it was sent for ratification by state legislatures in a <b>process</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> president plays no part, though Johnson opposed it. The amendment {{was designed to}} put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but also went further. The amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the United States (except Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts. It also guaranteed that the federal debt would be paid and forbade repayment of Confederate war debts. Further, it disqualified many former Confederates from office, although the disability could be removed—by Congress, not the president. Both houses passed the Freedmen's Bureau Act a second time, and again the President vetoed it; this time, the veto was overridden. By the summer of 1866, when Congress finally adjourned, Johnson's method of restoring states to the Union by executive fiat, without safeguards for the freedmen, was in deep trouble. His home state of Tennessee ratified the Fourteenth Amendment despite the President's opposition. When Tennessee did so, Congress immediately seated its proposed delegation, embarrassing Johnson.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} have specifically compared baptism with the Isiac initiation described by Apuleius. Before the early fourth century CE, baptism was {{the culmination of}} a long <b>process,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> convert to Christianity fasted for the forty days of Lent before being immersed at Easter in a cistern or natural body of water. Like the mysteries of Isis, then, early Christian baptism involved a days-long fast and a washing ritual. Both fasting and washing were common types of ritual purification found in the religions of the Mediterranean, and Christian baptism was specifically derived from the baptism of Jesus and Jewish immersion rituals. Therefore, according to Hugh Bowden, these similarities come from the shared religious background of Christianity and the Isis cult, not from the influence of one tradition upon the other.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, Chris Hemsworth was in {{negotiations}} {{to portray the}} title role after a back-and-forth <b>process</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> 25-year-old actor was refused early on, then given {{a second chance to}} read for the part. Hemsworth's brother, Liam also auditioned for the role, but was passed on by Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige. The next day, Marvel announced that Tom Hiddleston, who had worked with Branagh before and had initially been considered to portray the lead role, had been cast as Loki. In June 2009, Feige confirmed that both Hemsworth and Hiddleston had signed on. Feige mentioned that the film would take place on both modern day Earth and Asgard but Thor's human host, Dr. Donald Blake, would not be included. In July 2009, Marvel announced that Natalie Portman would portray Jane Foster. Jaimie Alexander and Colm Feore were reported to have joined the cast in September, with Alexander portraying Sif and Feore's role unrevealed, though it was thought to be a villain. In an interview with Swedish news site Ystads Allehanda, Stellan Skarsgård stated that he had joined the cast, though he did not specify his role. By late October Anthony Hopkins had been cast as Odin in the film. The following month, Marvel announced that they had cast the Warriors Three; Fandral was to be played by Stuart Townsend, Hogun was to be played by Tadanobu Asano and Volstagg was to be played by Ray Stevenson. Idris Elba was announced to have joined the cast, portraying Heimdall. Natalie Portman revealed that Kat Dennings would be involved in the project, portraying Darcy, a coworker of Portman's Jane Foster.|$|E

40|$|Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) {{measurements}} on high temperature superconductors, such as BiSrCaCuO, show three main components. These are a quasiparticle spectral peak that develops below the superconducting transition temperature Tc, an accompanying broad background of secondary electrons and a dip feature beside the main quasiparticle peak. The broad background may originate from inelastic <b>processes</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> photoelectron emits and absorbs spin fluctuations. Calculations of the quasiparticle spectral weight are presented incorporating these spin fluctuation mediated inelastic <b>processes</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> {{development of the}} superconducting gap ∆ has been incorporated into the magnetic susceptibility χ(⃗q, E). A dip feature develops below Tc in the quasiparticle spectral weight due to the shifting of spin fluctuation spectral weight, Imχ(⃗q, E), from low energies to energies greater than 2 ∆. These results predict that the dip feature in the ARPES spectrum in high temperature superconductors such as BiSrCaCuO, is evidence {{for the opening of}} a spin gap below Tc. ...|$|R
