5|$|During the First World War, Newfoundland was {{a largely}} rural Dominion of the British Empire with a {{population}} of 240,000, and not yet part of Canada. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 led the Government of Newfoundland to recruit a force for service with the British Army. Even though the island had not possessed any formal military organization since 1870, enough men soon volunteered that an entire battalion was formed, and later maintained throughout the war. The regiment trained at various locations in the United Kingdom and increased from an initial contingent of 500 men to full battalion strength of 1,000 men, before being deployed. After a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>acclimatization</b> in Egypt, the regiment was deployed at Suvla Bay on the Gallipoli peninsula with the 29th British Division in support of the Gallipoli Campaign.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{altitude}} on exercise performance of lowlanders {{has long been}} discussed, {{but it is still}} unclear whether the performance reduction is related to inefficiency of the respiratory system, body tissues or both. In the present work, exergy analysis was applied to the human body in order to compare its exergy efficiency under basal conditions and during physical activity at sea level and high altitudes for different <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>acclimatization.</b> Two control volumes were analyzed: respiratory system and human body as a whole. Data concerning mass and energy balances of the body and respiratory system were obtained from models available in the literature, which were modified based on medical literature to simulate the responses to physical activity at high altitude for different <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>acclimatization.</b> The results indicated that the respiratory system exergy efficiency is reduced at high altitudes and under physical activity, while exergy efficiency of the body increases for both parameters, which may indicate that the discomfort reported at high altitudes is mostly related to the respiratory system than to the other ones. Concerning the acclimatization period, its influence was more pronounced on the respiratory system...|$|R
40|$|Fluctuations in {{autonomic}} cardiovascular regulation during {{exposure to}} high altitude {{may increase the}} risk of heart at-tack during waking and sleep.

The significant increase in sympathetic autonomic cardiovascular modulation at high altitude protects against excessive oxygen deprivation during sleep.

2500|$|In autumn, Price sent Carry Back to France {{to prepare}} for a run in Europe's most famous {{all-aged}} race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris. This was a very unusual move in 1962, when trans-Atlantic travel for race horses was a difficult process. American horses such as Reigh Count and Omaha had been successful in Europe, but only after long <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>acclimatization.</b> Arriving in France in mid-September, Price had only three weeks to prepare Carry Back for the unfamiliar conditions including the turf surface and clockwise track. Price booked the British-based Australian rider Scobie Breasley to ride the American challenger, a move that attracted the approval of experts including Eddie Arcaro who stated that an American jockey would be [...] "buried riding low on that Longchamp track". Breasley placed Carry Back on the wide outside of the field, (following Price's orders to [...] "stay out of trouble") and was never in contention. He finished tenth, beaten by five and a half lengths by the 40/1 long-shot Soltikoff. Price was unhappy at the result and issued a challenge to the owners of the first five horses for a winner-take-all rematch at $25,000 each. The connections of the filly Monade accepted, but the other owners declined.|$|R
40|$|After a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> {{ventilatory}} <b>acclimatization</b> to {{high altitude}} (VAH), {{a degree of}} hyperventilation persists after relief of the hypoxic stimulus. This is likely, in part, to reflect the altered acid-base status, {{but it may also}} arise, in part, from the development during VAH of a component of carotid body (CB) activity that cannot be entirely suppressed by hyperoxia. To test this hypothesis, eight volunteers undergoing a simulated ascent of Mount Everest in a hypobaric chamber were acutely exposed to 30 min of hyperoxia at various stages <b>of</b> <b>acclimatization.</b> For the second 10 min of this exposure, the subjects were given an infusion of the CB inhibitor, dopamine (3 microg. kg(- 1). min(- 1)). Although there was both a significant rise in ventilation (P < 0. 001) and a fall in end-tidal PCO(2) (P < 0. 001) with VAH, there was no progressive effect of dopamine infusion on these variables with VAH.

UENF 114111 and Burkholderia silvatlantica strain UENF 117111) during greenhouse acclimatization was studied by Baldotto and colleagues [33]. The <b>period</b> <b>of</b> pineapple <b>acclimatization</b> is critical due to the low growth rate of roots and shoots. In this phase, structural and physiological adjustments of plantlets to ex vitro conditions are crucial for the success in the subsequent phase, i.e., field transplantation.

The isolated application of HA increased root growth by 50 %, bacteria by 81 % and the combined treatment by 105 %. Pineapple growth was influenced by inoculation with both Burkholderia, and further improved in combination with humic acids, resulting in higher shoot and root biomass as well as nutrient contents (N 132 %, P 131 %, K 80 %) than in uninoculated plantlets.

40|$|The {{biodegradation}} of {{nitrilotriacetic acid}} (NTA), a synthetic replacement detergent builder, in the estuarine environment was examined {{by using a}} laboratory estuarine simulation. Two interdependent microcosms were used; each of five vessels was equilibrated with a saline gradient between 1. 30 and 17. 17 %, with the final vessel subsequently being increased to a maximum salinity of 31. 6 %. Each microcosm was seeded simultaneously with heterotrophic bacteria from both fresh and saline sources. Viable counts demonstrated the ability of each microcosm to sustain a mixed heterotrophic bacterial community throughout the range of salinities for 183 days after a stabilization period. Isolation studies demonstrated that both systems contained four bacterial species, representatives of the genera Vibrio and Flavobacterium {{and members of the}} coryneform group and the family Enterobacteriaceae. Total bacterial numbers and species diversity decreased with increased salinity. NTA was administered at low and high concentrations, one concentration to each microcosm, initially with the least amount of saline. Removal of both concentrations of NTA occurred and was attributed to biodegradation after a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> bacterial <b>acclimatization.</b> Subsequent dosing <b>of</b> NTA to vessels of higher salinity demonstrated that biodegradation was incomplete at observed mean salinities of greater than 9. 18 % at low influent NTA concentrations and greater than 5. 08 % at high influent NTA concentrations. Therefore, acclimatization was dose dependent.
