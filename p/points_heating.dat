This token is the authority to occupy the single line, and it cannot be removed from the train until the driver him/herself releases it. After receiving the token, the driver is then given verbal permission to pass the “Stop Board” and enter that section; the stop board is used instead of signals and therefore needs no electrical supply. The fixed distant board on the approach has a single permanent AWS inductor which gives a warning in the cab regardless of the signal box instruction and has to be cancelled when passed. Points at the entrance to a crossing loop are spring-loaded for the correct track for facing movements, and are pushed across by the wheels for trailing movements; they too require no power or interlocking, other than for <b>points</b> <b>heating</b> purposes. In the facing direction, a 'points indicator' is provided to indicate to the driver that the points are correctly set. The points indicator {{is in the form of}} a yellow light, lit only while the points are electrically detected in the required position. The whole line can be operated by just one or two signallers and needs very little infrastructure other than the track itself, making it a very cost-effective method.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, we {{demonstrate}} self-assembly fabrication {{methods for}} programmable global and localized surface wrinkling by utilizing the shape memory effects of shape memory polymers (SMPs). Heat responsive SMPs, {{due to their}} capability of memorizing and recovering different shapes, can provide unique opportunities to realize smart surface wrinkling, and therefore were used as smart substrates or films. To build the bilayer film-substrate system, thin films, such as Si ribbons and aluminum films, were transferred or deposited {{on the surface of}} programmed SMP substrates. In the Si ribbon-SMP system, time and temperature dependent wrinkling formation and evolution were observed and systematically studied. For the localized heating cases, such as line and <b>point</b> <b>heating,</b> aluminum thin films were deposited on the programmed SMP substrates and heating wires were used to achieve heating the samples locally. The wrinkling patterns by line heating showed good sinusoidal profiles, with wavelength and amplitude decreasing gradually with the distance from the heating source. The area of wrinkling can also be tuned with large range. For the systems <b>heated</b> by <b>point</b> <b>heat</b> sources, hierarchical wrinkling patterns were achieved. Two distinct wrinkling patterns, spoke and ring patterns, formed in a circular area around the heat source. Spoke patterns appeared around the <b>point</b> <b>heat</b> sources due to the free boundary conditions in the radial direction, and ring patterns appeared at the periphery due to the constraint from the outside SMP. We have also demonstrated the method to reversibly control the formation and disappearance of the wrinkling through SMP film-elastomer substrate system. In addition, fabrication of three-dimensional hierarchical structures through sequential wrinkling is presented. These results in this dissertation offer simple methods to fabricate different types of programmable surface wrinkling pattern, with potential applications in stretchable electronics, optical gratings, surface engineering, advanced manufacturing, and other demanding applications...|$|R
