Trapping is not allowed in Oregon, where western <b>painted</b> turtle populations are in decline, and in Missouri, where there are populations of both southern and western subspecies. In Canada, Ontario protects both subspecies present, the midland and western, and British Columbia protects its dwindling western <b>painted</b> turtles.|$|E

5|$|Since {{at least}} 1958, the {{subspecies}} {{were thought to}} have evolved in response to geographic isolation during the last ice age, 100,000 to 11,000years ago. At that time <b>painted</b> turtles were divided into three different populations: eastern <b>painted</b> turtles along the southeastern Atlantic coast; southern <b>painted</b> turtles around the southern Mississippi River; and western <b>painted</b> turtles in the southwestern United States. The populations were not completely isolated for sufficiently long, hence wholly different species never evolved. When the glaciers retreated, about 11,000years ago, all three subspecies moved north. The western and southern subspecies met in Missouri and hybridized to produce the midland <b>painted</b> turtle, which then moved east and north through the Ohio and Tennessee river basins.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Paint</b> {{is used as}} {{top coat}} in Automobile Refinishing that is divided into 1 K <b>paint</b> of base type and 2 K <b>paint</b> of {{urethane}} type. after using 1 K <b>paint,</b> it can be reusable. However 2 K <b>paint</b> is not available that is mixed {{a certain amount of}} base with hardner, so 2 K <b>paint</b> has to be used all at a time or discarded the rest. This study covered that colored Urethane <b>paint</b> and colorless urethane <b>paint</b> in top coating process of AR. Top coat urethane <b>paint</b> is divided into colored urethane <b>paint</b> and transparent urethane <b>paint</b> like clear coat. Colored urethane <b>paint</b> is used for <b>paint</b> that contains resin, pigment, solvent and additives. It is color such as black and white. While transparent urethane <b>paint</b> is used for <b>paint</b> that contains resin, solvent and additives. Urethane <b>paint</b> has a <b>paint</b> system that cur after several hours of mixing base and hardner. By a <b>paint</b> technician of a field and empirical data, we can also recognize that according to worker's <b>paint</b> style and experience, although he or she <b>paint</b> same car model and area, <b>paint</b> use of one's is different. There aren't guidelines workers refer to about <b>paint</b> use by car models and work scope because ARP works various car models that are in different color, size and area. After using urethane <b>paint,</b> the rest of <b>paint</b> has come, and there are highs and lows in <b>paint</b> use each time he or she works. Therefore, this study suggest a basic guideline to use <b>paint</b> efficiently and regularly by understanding area, the type of work, and <b>paint</b> use that are appropriate for each car model and regardless of workers and work scopes in AR...|$|R
