5000|$|While the oral, {{and thus}} changeable, aspect of folk {{literature}} {{is an important}} defining characteristic, much of this oral tradition has been written into a print format. To <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> folklore in a written form can still be considered folklore, Utely <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> folklore [...] "may appear in print, but must not freeze into print." [...] It should be <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> all the examples of folk literature cited {{in this article are}} taken from print, rather than oral sources.|$|R
50|$|Other criticisms <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> {{these studies}} have been small scale, with conspicuously shallow {{participant}} pools and lopsided gender distributions. Researchers have <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> there aren't enough studies {{on the effects of}} any form of Ginseng on the common cold to form any conclusions.|$|R
5|$|Critics have {{objected to}} {{the killing of the}} sea lions, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the level of {{mortality}} permitted as a result of recreational and commercial fisheries in the river and as part of the operation of hydroelectric dams pose a greater threat to the salmon.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the novel}} {{has had its}} {{defenders}} among feminists in the academy, such as Alison Hennegan, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the novel did raise awareness of homosexuality among the British public and {{cleared the way for}} later work that tackled gay and lesbian issues.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the self-immolation, the Falun Dafa Information Center {{denied that the}} self-immolators could have been Falun Gong practitioners, emphatically <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Falun Gong's teachings do not sanction any form of violence, and that suicide is considered a sin.|$|E
50|$|Yanukovych {{was seen}} by opponents as {{representing}} the interests of Ukraine big business; they <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> his campaigns have benefited from backing by Ukrainian billionaire Rinat Akhmetov.

5000|$|The {{takedown}} sparked dialogue among opinion writers. The website's {{critics have}} defended their actions {{based on the}} fact that the intellectual property owners did not directly authorize the website. Its defenders <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the owners did authorize the loaning out of the ebooks and that ignorance of the terms and conditions would not exempt the authors from them. [...] One commentator <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the takedown was a direct side effect of Digital Rights Management. They <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> few people would have complained if people were swapping physical copies of books.|$|R
5|$|Weber's {{explanations}} are highly {{specific to the}} historical periods he analysed. Some academics disagree, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that,</b> {{despite the fact that}} Weber did write in the early twentieth century, his ideas remain alive and relevant for understanding issues like politics, bureaucracy, and social stratification today.|$|E
5|$|Social {{media was}} blamed for {{bringing}} unwanted {{visitors to the}} site and not <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the area is off-limits to the public.

5|$|The {{issue of}} control over the {{northern}} branch of the Silk Road by the Caliphate has been suggested as a further motive for the conflict, but G. Mako disputes this claim by <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> warfare declined at precisely the period of the greatest expansion of traffic along the Silk Road, i.e. after the middle of the 8th century.|$|E

50|$|Supporters of {{the popular}} {{referendum}} <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> it is a safeguard against special interests taking over, and protects the rights of minorities.

On the way, Jack asks about the symptoms of Ben's spinal tumor, particularly <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> it will kill him. Ben professes not to know what Jack is talking about. Privately, Ben asks Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) why she showed his X-rays to Jack. Juliet replies that she never told Jack whose X-rays they were, and remarks that Ben must have inadvertently confirmed Jack's guess.|$|E
5|$|Elton {{does not}} believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of {{specific}} information about the battle—no-one even knows exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as {{just one part of}} Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} is non-linear: {{the gravitational}} influence of two masses {{is not simply}} the sum of those masses' individual gravitational influences, as had {{been the case in}} Newtonian gravity. Ehlers participated in the discussion of how the back-reaction from gravitational radiation onto a radiating system could be systematically described in a non-linear theory such as general relativity, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the standard quadrupole formula for the energy flux for systems like the binary pulsar had not (yet) been rigorously derived: a priori, a derivation demanded the inclusion of higher-order terms than was commonly assumed, higher than were computed until then.|$|E

5|$|However, {{evidence}} <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> {{the number}} of bezants on each shield was greater than five during long periods following Afonso I's reign, {{as well as the}} fact that only in the 15th century was this legend registered on a chronicle by Fernão Lopes (1419), support this explanation as one of pure myth and highly charged with patriotic feeling in the sense that Portugal was created by divine intervention and was destined for great things.|$|E
5|$|Jon and Tyrion see the Wall for {{the first}} time as they arrive with Benjen and the other recruits. En route to the Wall, Tyrion and Jon discuss the Night's Watch. Tyrion is quick to disabuse Jon of his romantic notions of the Watch as a noble calling battling the mythical horrors beyond the Wall (as it was in history), <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> now it is more a dumping ground for the {{unwanted}} of Westeros: criminals, prisoners, and bastards.|$|E
5|$|Others counter {{these claims}} by <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> bathhouses {{are a major}} source of safer sex informationthey provide {{pamphlets}} and post safer sex posters prominently (often on the walls of each room {{as well as in the}} common areas), provide free condoms and lubricants, and often require patrons to affirm that they will only have safer sex on the premises. In cities with larger gay populations, STD and HIV testing and counseling may be offered on-site for no charge.|$|E
25|$|Greece and Rome were {{looked to}} as model republics {{throughout}} this debate, and authors {{on both sides}} took Roman pseudonyms. Brutus <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the Greek and Roman states were small, whereas the U.S. is vast. He also <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the expansion of these republics resulted in a transition from free government to tyranny.|$|R
50|$|Opponents of the {{doctrine}} <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> what a president can say during his tenure is not a source of law, and that this doctrine therefore has no legal value. Proponents <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> it was nevertheless consistently applied till 2002, and consider that the former president had committed the Republic through his words.|$|R
50|$|Some {{commentators}} have <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the complex design of scissor section flats {{leads to a}} more complex, and costly, construction process while architects have <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the use of so many flights of stairs and the half-storey design means that this form of layout would not meet modern building regulations around accessibility.|$|R
5|$|Part of the {{conflict}} between Team Bondi and Rockstar was due to Rockstar's frustration with Team Bondi's direction, and eventually Team Bondi's management in turn resented Rockstar for taking lots of creative control. It's also worth <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Rockstar used to be very keen on making Team Bondi something like 'Rockstar Sydney' - the more they worked with Team Bondi management, the more they {{came to understand that}} this was a terrible idea.|$|E
5|$|President John F. Kennedy {{solicited}} MacArthur's {{counsel in}} 1961. The {{first of two}} meetings was held shortly after the Bay of Pigs Invasion. MacArthur was extremely critical of the military advice given to Kennedy, and cautioned the young President to avoid a U.S. military build-up in Vietnam, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> domestic problems {{should be given a}} much greater priority. Shortly before his death, MacArthur gave similar advice to President Lyndon B. Johnson.|$|E
5|$|The hybrid {{program has}} been criticized, with one of Sulimov's colleagues <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> in other tests the Laika {{performed}} {{just as well as}} the jackal hybrids. The assumption that dogs have lost some of their scent-detection ability may be incorrect, in that dogs {{need to be able to}} scent-detect and identify the many humans that they come into contact with in their domesticated environment. Another researcher crossed German Shepherds with wolves and claimed that this hybrid had superior scent-detection abilities. The scientific evidence to support the claims of hybrid researchers is minimal, and more research has been called for.|$|E
