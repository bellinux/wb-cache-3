40|$|International audienceRecently, the {{interest}} of the coupling between atmospheric solid analysis probe (ASAP) and ion mobility– mass spectrometry has been revealed in the field of polymers. This method associates a direct ionization technique with a bi-dimensional separation method. <b>Poly(ether</b> <b>ether</b> <b>ketones)</b> (<b>PEEK)</b> belong to the family of the poly(aryl <b>ether</b> <b>ketones)</b> (PAEK) which are high performance aromatic polymers usually used in aerospace, electronics and nuclear industries. PEEK are important commercial thermoplastics with excellent chemical resistance and good mechanical properties. Because of their low solubility, few structural characterization studies of PEEK have been reported. In mass spectrometry, only MALDI-TOF analyses for polymer synthesis monitoring have been described with the use of strong acids such as sulfuric acid. This work demonstrates that ASAP is particularly efficient for analysis of PEEK in a solvent free approach with the production of intact small oligomers (n 2). Five types of PEEK oligomers with different end-groups were evidenced. With MALDI-TOF, the same end-groups with almost the same relative abundance were obtained which support the hypothesis that the oligomers detected in ASAP are intact small oligomers and not fragments or pyrolysis products. This is particularly interesting as generally the ASAP analysis of polymers yields pyrolysis products with the loss of end-group information. The end-groups assignments have been confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments on the M+ molecular ions, which allowed highlighting some specific neutral or radical losses as well as two diagnostic product ions. Thus, ASAP-IM/MS/MS proves to be a fast and efficient alternative way to characterize low solubility polymers such as PEEK...|$|R

40|$|The growing {{market of}} liquid and gas {{separation}} (GS) demands for improvements of existing membranes and/or {{development of new}} membranes. In the case of GS, crucial are the anti-plasticization properties of the membrane polymer, while for e. g. solvent resistant nanofiltration (SRNF), solvent stability is important, including stability {{in a wide range}} of pH (1 - 14) and at high temperature. When preparing thin film composite membranes for any kind of membrane applications, the support layer is preferably highly chemically stable to allow coating of the selective layer from any kind of solvent or to allow any kind of chemical or thermal post-treatment. All these very diverse aspects require implementation of cross-linking in membrane synthesis. The most typical method is via chemical cross-linking, realized through a chemical reaction between the membrane polymer (e. g. polyimide) and a cross-linker (e. g. a diamine). Such cross-linking methods have some disadvantages. Firstly, they cannot be used to all polymers, such as polysulfones (PSUs) or <b>poly(ether</b> <b>ether</b> <b>ketones)</b> (<b>PEEKs),</b> because of the lack of reactive groups in the backbone of such polymer chains. In addition, chemical cross-linking also generates waste streams, often very environmentally unfriendly. A new generic way to prepare highly chemical and thermal resistant SRNF membranes is presented in this PhD thesis. The concept is based on the preparation via nonsolvent induced phase separation (NIPS) of an asymmetric membrane consisting of a semi-interpenetrating polymer network (SIPN). As base polymer for the membranes, polysulfone (PSU) was proposed because of its good chemical, thermal, and mechanical properties, as well as its intrinsic photosensitivity and lack of reactive groups. The latter is of importance in e. g. SRNF, where membrane polarity is often undesired. When combined with the appropriate acrylate cross-linkers, SIPN structure was obtained by employing simple UV cross-linking, hence not generating any waste streams. Moreover, this method is quick, easy to use and upscale. In the first part, the photochemical aspects of the synthesis of SRNF membranes via NIPS/UV were studied. Additives suitable for UV cross-linking reaction were chosen, including cross-linkers with a varying functionality, as well as initiators from the group of free-radical photoinitiators type I and type II. The photoinitiators were applied in different concentrations. The influence of the additives, of the UV dose, and of the membrane thickness on the UV curing efficiency was investigated. The resulting membranes were analysed by ATR-FTIR, HPLC, DSC, and screened for solvent resistance. The SIPN network structure was characterized by DSC and TGA analysis. The best type and concentration of photoinitiator were selected for the further studies. In the second part, the morphological aspects and the performance of the resulting membranes in SRNF were explored. Asymmetric membranes consisting of 2, 4, 6 -trimethylbenzoyl-diphenyl-phosphine oxide (TPO) as photoinitiator and acrylate cross-linkers with different functionality were synthesized via NIPS/UV. The effects of various cross-linker types and of the membrane synthesis sequence on morphology, SRNF, and solvent resistant properties of the membrane were examined. Based on the obtained results, various poly(aryl sulfones) (PASUs) were screened in the last part. The influence of PASU type and concentration in the casting solution on UV curing efficiency, membrane morphology, SRNF performance, and solvent resistance was investigated. Polysulfone (with high and low molecular weight), poly(ether sulfone), and poly(phenyl sulfone) membranes were prepared using 3 wt% of TPO and 5 wt% of penta-acrylate cross-linker. The membranes were synthesized by NIPS/UV and characterized by SEM, ATR-FTIR, and SRNF. As a result, SIPN based membranes consisting of linear PSU and cross-linked polyacrylate (PAc) were developed by a very easy, versatile, and environmentally benign method. The optimized asymmetric membranes based on such SIPN, showed good SRNF performance and superior chemical resistance in comparison to conventional PSU membranes. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{progress made}} during Phase I and Phase II of the project: "Pre-Combustion Carbon Capture by a Nanoporous, Superhydrophobic Membrane Contactor Process," under contract DE-FE- 0000646. The {{objective of this}} project {{is to develop a}} practical and cost effective technology for CO{sub 2 } separation and capture for pre-combustion coal-based gasification plants using a membrane contactor/solvent absorption process. The goals of this technology development project are to separate and capture at least 90 % of the CO{sub 2 } from Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power plants with less than 10 % increase in the cost of energy services. Unlike conventional gas separation membranes, the membrane contactor is a novel gas separation process based on the gas/liquid membrane concept. The membrane contactor is an advanced mass transfer device that operates with liquid {{on one side of the}} membrane and gas on the other. The membrane contactor can operate with pressures that are almost the same on both sides of the membrane, whereas the gas separation membranes use the differential pressure across the membrane as driving force for separation. The driving force for separation for the membrane contactor process is the chemical potential difference of CO{sub 2 } in the gas phase and in the absorption liquid. This process is thus easily tailored to suit the needs for pre-combustion separation and capture of CO{sub 2 }. Gas Technology Institute (GTI) and PoroGen Corporation (PGC) have developed a novel hollow fiber membrane technology that is based on chemically and thermally resistant commercial engineered polymer <b>poly(ether</b> <b>ether</b> <b>ketone)</b> or <b>PEEK.</b> The PEEK membrane material used in the membrane contactor during this technology development program is a high temperature engineered plastic that is virtually non-destructible under the operating conditions encountered in typical gas absorption applications. It can withstand contact with most of the common treating solvents. GTI and PGC have developed a nanoporous and superhydrophobic PEEK-based hollow fiber membrane contactor tailored for the membrane contactor/solvent absorption application for syngas cleanup. The membrane contactor modules were scaled up to 8 -inch diameter commercial size modules. We have performing extensive laboratory and bench testing using pure gases, simulated water-gas-shifted (WGS) syngas stream, and a slipstream from a gasification derived syngas from GTIÃ¢ÂÂs Flex-Fuel Test Facility (FFTF) gasification plant under commercially relevant conditions. The team have also carried out an engineering and economic analysis of the membrane contactor process to evaluate the economics of this technology and its commercial potential. Our test results have shown that 90 % CO{sub 2 } capture can be achieved with several physical solvents such as water and chilled methanol. The rate of CO{sub 2 } removal by the membrane contactor is in the range of 1. 5 to 2. 0 kg/m{sup 2 }/hr depending on the operating pressures and temperatures and depending on the solvents used. The final economic analysis has shown that the membrane contactor process will cause the cost of electricity to increase by 21 % from the base plant without CO{sub 2 } capture. The goal of 10 % increase in levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from base DOE Case 1 (base plant without capture) is not achieved by using the membrane contactor. However, the 21 % increase in LCOE is a substantial improvement as compared with the 31. 6 % increase in LCOE as in DOE Case 2 (state of art capture technology using 2 -stages of Selexol{TM}) ...|$|R

The blend membrane {{was found to be}} promising for DMFC applications because of its lower methanol diffusivity (2. 75 × 10 − 7 cm 2 s− 1) and higher proton conductivity (6. 4 × 10 − 3 S cm− 1), than the SPEEK membrane. The DMFC application testing results was also exhibited that during charging process, the SPEEK membrane could produced the voltage similar with the Nafion membrane.
