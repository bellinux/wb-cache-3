5000|$|The GET Program is a prepaid 529 plan, and {{accounts}} {{may only be}} opened by, or on behalf of, residents {{of the state of}} Washington. The value of an account is dictated by the quantity of [...] "units" [...] purchased. Units have a purchase value and a payout value which are subject to increase yearly. The U.S. dollar payout value of one unit is always equal to one percent of the annual full-time, undergraduate, in-state tuition and state-mandated fees at the most expensive public university in the state - either the University of Washington or Washington State University. Through July 31, 2015, the purchase price of one unit is substantially higher than the payout value: $172 vs $117.82, respectively. This premium over current tuition provides financial stability for the program at the expense of program participant returns, since tuition is guaranteed in the future, regardless of how much it increases. For example, tuition in Washington state saw double-digit increases for four straight years from 2008 to 2012. This purchase:payout price ratio has risen from previously more favorable levels in the past. In 2007 the purchase price was $70 per unit while the <b>payout</b> <b>price</b> was $59, for a ratio of only 1.19. Current estimates project that GET units should be held for at least six years to see financial gain, versus other investment options which provide immediate return. GET is aggressively marketed as a long term program for families with young children, but the benefit of enrollment remains questionable.|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} form of {{pollution}} from New Zealand dairy farming is nitrogen, in the form of nitrates, being leached into aquifers and waterways resulting in increased nitrate levels and eutrophication of water bodies. The nitrate pollutants originate from cow urine and chemical nitrogen fertilisers which both contain ammonium nitrogen. The ammonium nitrogen is subsequently transformed into nitrates and nitrites by microbial behaviour in the soil profile. The transformation of nitrogen by soil microbes is called nitrification. In an attempt to reduce the negative environmental impact of New Zealand dairy production the nitrification inhibitor product eco-n™ was developed by scientists at Lincoln University and commercially released by the Ravensdown Fertiliser Cooperative in 2004. Despite the benefits of eco-n™ in both an environmental protection and a production sense there has been lower uptake of eco-n™ than expected by Ravensdown. The usage rate of econ ™ by Ravensdown’s dairy farmer shareholders across Canterbury, Otago and Southland was 17 % in 2008 and 7 % in 2009. This research seeks to investigate the factors influencing these eco-n™ adoption rates while also paying attention to published material about the diffusion and adoption of innovations. The research involved two separate research processes; the first was a quantitative analysis of the Ravensdown dairy customer database to identify the usage patterns of eco-n™. The second stage of the research was a mixed method approach that involved interviewing 108 dairy farmers about eco-n™. The resultant information created a qualitative case study that was then analysed using Microsoft Excel™ as well as more sophisticated statistical computer software. There were three obvious patterns to emerge from the usage analysis. The first pattern showed a decrease in eco-n™ usage between 2008 and 2009 across all sub-groups. The second pattern showed a consistently higher eco-n™ usage with large farms classified by Ravensdown as Key Accounts. The third pattern demonstrated a higher eco-n™ usage rate with farms located closest to and within Canterbury. The second stage of the research project found a range of mediums have helped the spread of eco-n™ information. The two most prominent influences of eco-n™ use have been the Ravensdown Account Managers and other dairy farmers. The 2009 -Users of eco-n™ {{are more likely to have}} adopted the technology for its environmental benefits while the discontinuous users are more likely to have adopted eco-n™ for its potential production and economic benefits. It is evident that the restricted uptake of eco-n™ is a result of inconsistent research messages relating to eco-n™, the limited ability to quantify the on-farm benefits and the variability in the results of eco-n™ use experienced by those who have used the product. Cashflow and price were also given as reasons for restricted uptake of eco-n™ and there is a distinct relationship between 2008 to 2009 eco-n™ usage and the 2008 to 2009 Fonterra <b>payout</b> <b>price.</b> The application restrictions on eco-n™, the up-front costs involved and the lack of sitespecific trial results are other factors adding to the restricted use of the technology. Over 95 % of the interviewed farmers believe they have received enough information about econ ™ to make a sound use decision...|$|E

40|$|There are {{numerous}} examples of assets with identical <b>payout</b> streams being <b>priced</b> differently. These {{violations of the}} law of one price result from two factors. First, investors have heterogeneous asset valuations so that if two groups of investors trade in segmented markets they are likely to set different prices because they have different expectations as to the value of the identical assets. Second, such discrepancies can only persist if arbitrage activities are limited. There appear to be two major limitations, short sales constraints and noise trader risk. Those assets facing short sales constraints have an asymmetric distribution of pricing violations because short sales constraints only bind when asset prices are too high. By contrast, assets facing noise trader risk have symmetric violation distributions because noise trader risk must be born by arbitrageurs both when prices are too low as well as too high. ...|$|R

In a second section we a basic reviews of subjects that will be needed for forecasting financial statements. We discuss the use of plugs for financial forecasting. We show an alternate approach to avoid such popular practice. The approach we propose follows the Double Entry Principle. This principle guarantees consistent and error free financial statements. We show with a simple example how the plug works and its limitations and problems that arise when using it. Next, the reader will find what information is needed for the forecasting of financial statements and where and how to find it. We present the procedure to identify policies that govern the ongoing of a firm such as accounts receivable and payable, inventories, dividend <b>payout,</b> and identify <b>price</b> increases and other basic variables. We also deal with the real life problem of a firm with multiple products and/or services.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a generic method for the Monte-Carlo pricing of (generalized) auto-callable {{products}} (aka. trigger products), i. e., products for which the payout function features a discontinuity with a (possibly) stochastic location (the trigger) and value (the <b>payout).</b> The Monte-Carlo <b>pricing</b> of products with discontinuous payout is known to come with a high Monte-Carlo error. The numerical calculation of sensitivities (i. e., partial derivatives) of such prices by finite differences gives very noisy results, since the Monte-Carlo approximation (being a finite sum of discontinuous functions) is not smooth. Additionally, the Monte-Carlo error of the finite-difference approximation explodes as the shift size tends to zero. Our method combines a product specific modification of the underlying numerical scheme, which is to some extent similar to an importance sampling and/or partial proxy simulation scheme and a reformulation of the payoff function into an equivalent smooth payout. From the financial product we merely require that hitting of the stochastic trigger will result in an conditionally analytic value. Many complex derivatives can be written in this form. A class of products where this property is usually encountered are the so called auto-callables, where a trigger hit results in cancellation of all future payments except for one redemption payment, which can be valued analytically, conditionally on the trigger hit. From the model we require that its numerical implementation allows for a calculation of the transition probability of survival (i. e., non-trigger hit). Many models allows this, e. g., Euler schemes of Itô processes, where the trigger is a model primitive. The method presented is effective across a large range of cases where other methods fail, e. g. small finite difference shift sizes or short time to trigger reset (approaching maturity); this means that a practitioner can use this method and be confident that it will work consistently. The method itself {{can be viewed as}} a generalization of the method proposed by Glasserman and Staum (2001), both with respect to the type (and shape) of the boundaries, as well as, with respect to the class of products considered. In addition we explicitly consider the calculation of sensitivities. Monte-Carlo simulation, pricing, greeks, variance reduction, auto-callable, trigger product, target redemption note...|$|R
40|$|Investors are {{continuously}} {{looking to}} increase the return on their investments. In an ideal world investors want {{to increase the}}re return and outperform the market. Theory states {{that it is impossible}} to do so without increasing your risk. Arbitrage is a concept where investors are able to generate risk-free returns exceeding the market. Dividend is a common tool for publicly listed firms when rewarding their shareholders. On ex- dividend day, the day after the dividend <b>payout,</b> the stock <b>price</b> should according to theory decrease in order for the valuation of the stock to be held constant. In our research we investigate if there are arbitrage opportunities in connection to the dividend payouts, namely the ex-dividend effect. We want to generalize our results across experimental settings, thus across different stock markets. As a basis for our research we picked the OMXS. We base our research on three theoretical areas: the dividend irrelevancy theory, the efficient market hypothesis and the anchoring theory. The dividend irrelevancy relates to how the stock price ought to behave on ex-dividend day whereas the efficient market hypotheses states that prices on a market fully reflects all available information. Both theories concur that no arbitrage opportunities should be available on the financial market. The anchoring theory highlights the fact that investors formulate an anchor price for financial assets, for example stocks. In our research we aim to formulate a practical method on how to make abnormal returns on the ex dividend effect, based on the anchoring theory. Our census sample consists of dividend-paying firms publicly registered on the OMXS, and consists of 694 observations taken from 2009 to 2012. The sample was picked on the basis of characteristics, for example that the firm has been registered for at least four years and paid dividend one time during the four years of investigation. In order to tests for arbitrage opportunities on ex-dividend day, we used a simple mathematical model measuring the deviation between the price drop cum-dividend day to ex-dividend day, and the dividend amount. We conclude that the price drop differs from the dividend amount, only accounting for a price drop of 0. 73 of the dividend amount. Thus, the price drop for each dividend unit is 0. 73, in relation to a perfectly efficient market where there should be no difference; hence the price drop would be equal to the dividend amount, 1. Research on the ex-dividend effect is a thoroughly investigated area, where the first research was presented in 1955. Previous research all attempts to explain why there are market anomalies, but none examine how one can capitalize on the findings. In our research we examine if it is possible to make abnormal returns based on a segmenting of stocks, depending on their price volatility. This research is thereby first in examining how to capitalize on found arbitrage opportunities. ...|$|R
40|$|Antitrust {{litigation}} often confronts {{situations where}} effects point in both directions. Judges sometimes describe {{the process of}} evaluating these factors as “balancing. ” In its e-Books decision the Second Circuit believed that the need to balance is what justifies application {{of the rule of}} reason. In Microsoft the D. C. Circuit stated that “courts routinely apply a…balancing approach” under which “the plaintiff must demonstrate that the anticompetitive harm…outweighs the procompetitive benefit. ” But then it decided the case without balancing anything. The term “balancing” is a very poor label for what courts actually do in these cases. Balancing requires that two offsetting effects can each be measured against each other by some common cardinal unit, such as dollars or tons or centimeters. The factors that courts consider under the rule of reason rarely lend themselves to such measurement. Instead, balancing approaches are usually “binary” rather than cardinal. They are more like off and on switches that go in one direction or the other. The Ninth Circuit’s decision in O’Bannon v. NCAA understood these limitations and performed balancing {{the way it should be}} done. In defending its compensation rules the court observed both the NCAA’s and the courts’ longstanding recognition of amateurism in collegiate athletics as requiring uncompensated play. This created a binary rule that a court could readily follow. The district court’s creation of a trust fund for deferred compensation and judicial determination of the <b>payout</b> was simply <b>price</b> regulation by another name. One place where a more cardinal form of balancing can work is merger analysis, particularly under the 2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines. The government’s prima facie challenge to a merger is based on a prediction of increased prices. If the test is met then the burden shifts to the defendant to show merger specific efficiencies of sufficient magnitude to reduce the predicted price to no higher than premerger levels. Stating consumer price increases as the principal concern creates a unit of measure that makes balancing at least conceptually possible. Second, the consumer price test articulated in the Guidelines is easier to administer than a general welfare test. In order to estimate general welfare effects one must be able to quantify consumer harm, which includes not only higher prices but also deadweight loss. This requires information about the shape of the demand curve. In addition, offsetting efficiencies must always be assessed and netted out. This requires a court to look not only at per unit cost savings, but also at the output over which those costs will be spread. Whether the Merger Guidelines more cardinal approach to balancing can be migrated to general antitrust litigation under the rule of reason depends on the challenged practice. Joint ventures with efficiency potential but threatening higher prices from collusion are a likely candidate. Practices that threaten exclusion will be more difficult to evaluate. Practices whose consequences show up in the longer run will be particularly difficult, as well as practices for which the defense has little to do with measurable prices...|$|R
40|$|Dairy {{production}} in Argentina {{is based on}} grazed pastures, with the inclusion of supplements as a secondary source of feed. The average milk production per hectare in Argentine dairy farms is low and this affects the profitability of the farms. The low efficiency of production per hectare appears {{to be associated with}} low stocking rate and low utilisation of the cheapest source of feed, which is grazed pasture. Data reviewed in the present study suggested that stocking rate (SR) and the amount of imported feed are factors with significant influence on dairy farm productivity and profitability in Argentina, as is also the case in New Zealand and Australia. Stocking rate, expressed as the number of cows per hectare, is a simplification of the relationship between feed demand and feed supply. This relationship can be better expressed as kilograms of live weight per tonne of dry matter total feed supply, defined as comparative stocking rate. The aim of this thesis was to quantify the effects of comparative SR and supplementation (imported feed) on the productivity and profitability of Argentine dairy farms. A simulation model was developed to predict pasture dry matter (DM) intake and the harvesting efficiency of grazing dairy cows in Argentina (Chapter 3). In validation tests, using data from cows grazing lucerne in Argentina and ryegrass-clover in Ireland, the model predicted satisfactorily. Following this, a simulation model was developed to predict milksolids (MS) production and live weight (Lwt) change of Argentine Holstein cows in grazing dairy systems, given a determined intake of metabolisable energy (Chapter 4). Finally, a whole-farm simulation model called the Argentine Dairy System Model (ADSM) was developed (Chapter 5). by integrating the models developed in Chapter 3 and 4, together with a pre-existent economic model for Argentine dairy farms. Model validation was conducted by comparing results from the model against data form eight Argentine dairy farms. The accuracy of model predictions was satisfactory. Twenty-two dairy systems were tested with ADSM, in order to allow the effects of comparative SR and supplementation to be explored. The cow type used was the Argentine Holstein (550 kg Lwt and 6. 8 % MS content). The present study suggests that the low MS production of Argentine dairy farms could be increased by increasing both comparative SR and the amount of supplements imported into the farm. Model predictions indicated that MS production per hectare would be maximised at a comparative SR of approximately 100 kg Lwt/t DM, economic farm surplus ($US/ha) at 90 kg Lwt/t DM, and return on assets at 80 kg Lwt/t DM. Additionally, the model predicted that cows stocked at a comparative SR of about 80 kg Lwt/t DM will neither increase nor decrease Lwt change over a complete season (lactating and dry periods). These results suggest that the optimum comparative SR, in terms of both economic and sustainable physical performance for the Argentine Holstein cows seems to be around 80 kg Lwt/t DM. Annual pasture utilization values were 70 %, 76 %, and 81 % for comparative SRs of 80, 90, and 100 kg Lwt /t DM, respectively. At the milk <b>payout</b> and concentrates <b>price</b> used in this study, it would be profitable {{to increase the amount of}} imported feed up to 3. 6 t DM per hectare, provided that SR is simultaneously increased, in order to achieve pasture utilisation of 70 % or higher. A dairy system with 8. 6 t DM/ha/year produced on-farm, importing 3. 6 t DM concentrates per year and stocked at 81 kg Lwt/t DM (1. 8 cows/ha) would be able to utilise 71 % of pasture and produce 626 kg MS/ha/year, which is about two-fold the average MS production of Argentine farms. Changing either the price of milk or the cost of concentrates by 10 % did not alter the relative profitability of the different systems...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} one of the {{deliverables}} for the project "Commodity Risk Management Group (ARD) seeks a qualified firm for Designing Index-Based Weather Insurance Contracts For Farmers in Central America, Terms of Reference. " In this report, we document the development of eleven revised and improved standardized drought contracts, including six contracts specified in the World Bank's Commodity Risk Management Group's Terms of Reference for this project. Contracts are developed for three locations in Nicaragua (Chinandega, Leon, and Managua) for rice, soy, and sorghum crops and three locations in Honduras (La Conce, Catacamas, and Guayabillas/Olancho) for sorghum, soy, and maize crops. We provide background on the contract structure and design methods used. The final standardized drought contracts perform very well in our statistical analysis using crop models, likely due to the strong potential represented by the initial contracts proposed by project partners. In this report we provide a detailed report and discussion of the contracts and the refinement process. Of course, it is important that project partners make sure to validate this performance through alternate sources of information, such as discussions with farmers, experts, and accurate historical yield data, when available. For the future, for standardization of the process, it could be worthwhile to make a more systematic process for quantitatively evaluating and tuning the contracts for additional risks (such as excess rainfall) based on farmer interviews and agronomic knowledge. Specifically we recommend evaluating each risk of the contract independently prior to bundling. We also recommend development of a process for documentation of farmer and expert interviews that would provide information on the risk, as well as a historical record of when each risk was an issue. More intimate inclusion of Reinsurers in the design process for standardized contracts, as well as development of guidelines for features that may lead to additional expense could help provide for fewer surprises in reinsurance pricing. We also recommend that the contracts for additional risks be structured and designed {{so that they can be}} adjusted to meet <b>price,</b> <b>payout,</b> and coverage constraints through systematic statistically-based tuning of a small number of parameters. In response to queries raised during the project by project partners we have deepened our study of the climate of Central America and its implications for the forecasts, we find that although there appears to be a strong link between the natural ENSO climate cycle and contract payouts, there is probably little scope for geographical hedging, as crops covered do not span the geographic regions with negatively correlated rainfall. It is likely that the best hedging strategy would be to include excess contracts in the drought portfolio. Also, we see little evidence for altering contracts or pricing to address potential long term precipitation trends in the near term. Given the strong potential for index insurance as a mechanism for adapting to climate risk, we highly recommend that products and prices be regularly updated over the years, with care to ensure the value and product continuity with each change. In response to queries raised during the project by project partners, we perform an in depth illustration and analysis of the use of rainfall simulators on the contracts. We illustrate the limitations of rainfall simulators as well as their potential for improving contract design and pricing for areas with short datasets, developing rainfall simulator for the analysis. Certain features of some contracts (the shifting sowing window) led a wide range of rainfall simulators to under-represent variability. Often, subtle contract features can lead to a lack of robustness to sensitivity tests and difficulty in analysis, and potentially could lead to increased reinsurance pricing without substantially adding to the quality of the coverage. We have noticed that the bulk of the protection of many of the contracts could be provided through much simpler indices that are much more robust to sensitivity tests and perform much more predictably on rainfall simulators when practically implementable. It may be that an additional stage of index design might be very valuable following the development of a sophisticated contract. This additional stage would be to determine if the bulk of the coverage of the contract could be duplicated in a simplified statistical approximation of the contract...|$|R
