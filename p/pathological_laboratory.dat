500|$|Although malaria {{was known}} to be endemic in the Milne Bay area, {{precautions}} taken against the disease were haphazard. Men wore shorts and kept their sleeves rolled up. Their mosquito repellent cream was ineffective, quinine was in short supply and many men arrived without their mosquito nets, which were stowed deep in the ships' holds and took several days to unload. A daily dosage of [...] was prescribed but Field's troops were told not to take their quinine until they had been in the area a week. By this time, many had become infected with the disease. The Director of Medicine at Allied Land Forces Headquarters was Brigadier Neil Hamilton Fairley, an expert on tropical medicine. He visited Port Moresby in June, and was alarmed at the ineffectiveness of the measures being taken to combat the disease, which he realised was capable of destroying the entire Allied force in Papua. He made sure that the 110th Casualty Clearing Station left Brisbane for Milne Bay with a fully equipped <b>pathological</b> <b>laboratory</b> and a large quantity of anti-malarial supplies, including 200,000 quinine tablets. Unfortunately, some equipment was lost or ruined in transit, and the danger from malaria was not yet appreciated at Milne Bay.|$|E

60|$|The {{many readers}} who enjoyed The Goodly Fellowship have been eagerly {{awaiting}} something {{more from the}} pen of the same author. This is at last announced. In Metzel Changes His Mind, Miss Schauffler strengthens the impression made by her first book {{that she is a}} writer of marked originality. Here again she has provided an unusual setting for her tale. The scene is largely laid in a <b>pathological</b> <b>laboratory,</b> surely a new background for a romance. It is a background, moreover, which is used most effectively by Miss Schauffler in the furtherance of her plot. Her characters, too, are as interesting as their surroundings--a woman doctor, attractive as well as sensible, a gruff old German doctor, suspicious of womankind, and a young American. Around these the action centers, though half a dozen others, vividly sketched, have a hand in the proceedings. Of course Metzel Changes His Mind is a love story, but not of the ordinary type.|$|E

30|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the sensitivity pattern of clinical isolates of otitis media. During the last few decades, the occurrence of otitis media seems to have been rising probably because of prevalence of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and β-lactamase producing Staphylococcus aureus in the pathogenesis of otitis media. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were the most common causative microorganisms of ear infection. Keeping in view the importance of these pathogens, the present study had been designed to determine the sensitivity pattern of clinical isolates of otitis media. These isolates were collected from different hospitals and <b>pathological</b> <b>laboratories</b> of Karachi and their sensitivity against cefepime and amoxicillin were determined by using disk diffusion method. The results have shown that Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common causative microorganism of ear infection. Cefepime, a fourth generation cephalosporin appeared to be an effective antibiotic against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a new application of superhydrophobic surfaces in conducting biological assays for human blood typing using a liquid drop micro reactor.

This novel blood typing method requires {{only a small amount}} of blood sample.

40|$|Abstract Background Bacteriological {{analysis}} of cardiac valves might be indicated {{in patients with}} suspected endocarditis. Methods We report here a prospective study on fifty-three consecutive patients whose native valves {{were sent to the}} bacteriological and <b>pathological</b> <b>laboratories,</b> to investigate the performance of direct microscopic examination of imprints and valve culture. Results On the basis of a histopathological gold standard to classify the inflammatory valve process, the sensitivity, the specificity, the positive and the negative predictive values of direct microscopic examination of imprints and valve culture were 21 %, 100 %, 100 %, 60 %, and 21 %, 72 %, 38 %, 52 % respectively. This weak threshold of the direct microscopic examination of imprints could be due to antimicrobial therapy prescribed before cardiac surgery {{and the fact that the}} patients came from a tertiary hospital receiving patients with a prolonged history of endocarditis. Conclusion Clinical context and histopathology are indispensable when analyzing the imprints and valve culture. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} Trichosporon species in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections fromwhich visual discrimination of non-glabrata Candida species is mostly ineffective but critical for the choice of antifungals, we tested the usefulness of a newly designed peptide nucleic acid probe (PNA) for in situ hybridization (ISH). Results confirmed the usefulness of ISH with our PNA probe in identifying Trichosporon species from Candida albicans. Trichosporon species have been reported as the second or thirdmost common agents of yeast fungemia (1 – 3), and the preva-lence has increased, particularly in patients with hematologic malignancies (4 – 6). Since Trichosporon spp. exhibit low suscepti-bility to candins (7), histopathological examination is important {{as one of the}} useful diagnostic procedures, even though it is re-garded as poor for the identification of Trichosporon species from other dimorphic yeasts, namely, non-glabrata Candida, species, because of their overall similarities (8 – 10). Therefore, the estab-lishment of an auxiliary diagnostic method for use in routine <b>pathological</b> <b>laboratories</b> is required for diagnosis of disseminated trichosporonosis.

40|$|Objectives: Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum {{antibiotic}} widely prescribed {{in clinical}} and hospital settings. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance against effective antibiotics {{is a global}} issue. The objective of study is the surveillance of ciprofloxacin against common pathogens. Methods: To investigate the present status of antimicrobial resistance against ciprofloxacin, five hundred and twenty four clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (30 %), Staphylococcus aureus (33 %), Salmonella typhi (9 %), Klebsiella pneumonia (14 %) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 %) were collected during study from January, 2008 to February, 2009 from different <b>pathological</b> <b>laboratories</b> running in and out side hospitals located in Karachi, Pakistan. These pathogens were isolated from specimens of {{both in and out}} patients. The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin was carried out by Disc Diffusion Method (Kirby-Bauer test). Results: Showed that ciprofloxacin is 27. 02 %, 21. 95 %, 16. 66 %, 72. 22 % and 44. 44 % resistant to Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa respectively. Conclusion: It is concluded that these clinical isolates have started developing resistance against ciprofloxacin due to its irrational and inappropriate use.

40|$|Introduction: Treatment of {{cervical}} carcinoma {{is affected}} by the stage of the disease, being most likely curable with early detection. High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and persistency are necessary to the development of precancerous and cancerous lesions leaving the possibility to detect in time cells progressing in at risk behaviour. Methods: This study documents the proportion of HPV DNA positivity in 906 samples with cytological result negative for intraepithelial lesion and malignancy (NILM), 220 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) samples and 211 low grade intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) samples collected from various <b>pathological</b> <b>laboratories</b> in Brussels, Belgium. Results: The proportion of samples harbouring one or more HPV types was 10. 8 % (95 % confidence interval, 95 % CI: 8. 8 - 12. 8) in NILM, 34. 5 % (95 % CI: 27. 6 - 40. 3) in ASC-US, 54. 3 % (95 % CI: 47. 5 - 61. 1) in LSIL, with significant variability of HPV proportion in ASC-US and LSIL between laboratories.
