It discussed the acquisition of land for the project's production facilities, which the Army recommended be {{in the vicinity of}} Knoxville, Tennessee, with the Boston firm of Stone & Webster as the project's <b>principal</b> <b>contractor.</b> The meeting on July 30, 1942, was devoted to reviewing progress on isotope separation by the centrifugal and gaseous diffusion methods. The August 26, 1942, meeting considered Lawrence's electromagnetic separation project, and expansion of the program to produce heavy water.|$|E

25|$|On 13 December 2011, the Minister for Finance {{signed the}} Commencement Order {{for the new}} {{electronic}} RCT system which was introduced on 1 January 2012. All principal contractors in the construction, forestry and meat processing sectors are obliged to engage electronically with Revenue. Under the new RCT system, a <b>principal</b> <b>contractor</b> must provide Revenue with details of the contract and the subcontractor. It must also notify Revenue of all relevant payments online before payment is made. Revenue will respond to the payment notification with a deduction authorisation setting out how much tax, if any, must be withheld. The rates are currently set at 0%, 20% or 35%. This deduction authorisation is sent electronically to the <b>principal</b> <b>contractor.</b> The principal must provide a copy or details of the deduction authorisation to the subcontractor if tax has been deducted. The subcontractor can set off the amount deducted against any tax he is liable to pay, or reclaim the difference where the deduction exceeds the amount of tax.|$|E
25|$|Prices are as {{a percent}} of the penal sum (the maximum that the surety is liable for) ranging from around one percent to five percent, with the most credit-worthy {{contracts}} paying the least.

25|$|Inigo Jones {{had brought}} the {{classical}} renaissance style to England in the early 17th century. His followers took the new classical style into the country, characterised by its symmetry and proportion and such classical elements as pilasters, while wide eaves took {{the place of a}} cornice. Often a bricklayer would also be the <b>principal</b> <b>contractor,</b> controlling the other trades, and he could avoid the necessity to employ a mason for stonework if he could produce the classical elements in brick. So in this house we have brick pilasters, one above the other, with capitals and bases shaped in brickwork. The rebuilding seems to have been carried out in two stages, though without a long gap between them. There is a straight joint in the brickwork {{to the left of the}} second pilaster on the north side. In front of this the bricks are laid in English bond, but Flemish bond is used towards the back, indicating that this part was built a little later.|$|E
500|$|In a [...] {{report to}} Colonel Leslie R. Groves, Jr., {{the head of}} the Construction Branch in the Office of the Chief of Engineers, on 11 August 1942, Marshall called for the {{creation}} a new district without territorial limits to administer the DSM project. His proposal was approved on 13 August. As district engineer of the new district, Marshall reported directly to Groves, and not the Chief of Engineers. He established the district headquarters on the 18th floor of 270 Broadway in New York City, with the innocuous name of the Manhattan Engineer District, following the usual practice of naming engineer districts after the city in which their headquarters area were located. He selected the Boston firm of Stone & Webster as the project's <b>principal</b> <b>contractor.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, the EPA {{announced}} {{the result of}} blood tests which showed high white blood cell counts, a precursor to leukemia, and chromosome damage in Love Canal residents. 33% of the residents had undergone chromosomal damage. In a typical population, chromosomal damage affects 1% of people. Other studies were unable to find harm. The United States National Research Council (NRC) surveyed Love Canal health studies in 1991. The NRC noted the major exposure of concern was the groundwater rather than drinking water; the groundwater [...] "seeped into basements" [...] and then led to exposure through air and soil noted several studies {{reported higher levels of}} low-birth weight babies and birth defects among the exposed residents with some evidence the effect subsided after the exposure was eliminated. The National Research Council also noted a study which found exposed children were found to have an [...] "excess of seizures, learning problems, hyperactivity, eye irritation, skin rashes, abdominal pain, and incontinence" [...] and stunted growth. Voles in the area were found to have significantly increased mortality compared to controls (mean life expectancy in exposed animals [...] "23.6 and 29.2 days, respectively, compared to 48.8 days" [...] for control animals). New York State also has an ongoing health study of Love Canal residents. In that year, the Albert Elia Building Co., Inc., now Sevenson Environmental Services, Inc., was selected as the <b>principal</b> <b>contractor</b> to safely re-bury the toxic waste at the Love Canal Site.|$|E
5000|$|After {{this section}} of the ring road was {{constructed}} {{the decision was made to}} separate pedestrians from traffic in the form of underpasses, subways and flyovers. The designer of the ring road Herbert Manzoni, believed that pedestrians should never cross carriageway of the ring road. Laing Construction were appointed as <b>principal</b> <b>contractors</b> for construction. The Hurst Street overpass was the first part of the building to be constructed completed in 1959.|$|R
50|$|Since these {{contractors}} {{had already}} caused minor slowdowns and protests over wages, recently arrived bank owners and merchants organized an owner-interest oriented contracting company called the Western Agricultural Contracting Company (WACC). The WACC quickly replaced the Japanese <b>contractors</b> as <b>principal</b> <b>contractors</b> to the Oxnard Plain and even forced {{some of them}} to subcontract through the WACC. Comprising more than 90 percent of the work force, the WACC had a near monopoly of the workers.|$|R

From the start the street attracted a mixed occupancy and included fine homes and shops. At the time of building it included two apothecaries, a cheesemonger, a tavern and a coffee house. Tailors were also prominent, including 13 listed in the Post Office directory of 1830.|$|R
50|$|The upgrade was {{expected}} to cost £59 million and was {{to be completed by}} December 2008, but the system was only released, for limited testing between Pwllheli and Harlech, in February 2010.

50|$|Whitelee Windfarm {{currently}} has a 75 turbine extension under construction. This will add an additional 217 MW of capacity, enough {{to power the}} equivalent of over 124,000 homes. This will bring the total generating capacity of the wind farm up to 539 MW. Work on this new development commenced in November 2010, with the completion date extended from December 2012 to March 2013. Additionally, the new extension will add a further 44 km of trails to the site.

40|$|Construction {{projects}} {{incorporate the}} input {{of a range of}} tradesmen and different sized firms, ranging from micro to large organisations. Working practices of micro construction firms are carried out in an informal manner while larger organisations tend to adopt more formal on-site management techniques. Many micro firms seek to develop long-term relationships with large <b>principal</b> <b>contractors</b> and a major strain on their relationships stem from the difference in safety management techniques they employ. Faced with a fundamental shift in their style of safety management, workers of micro construction firms must successfully negotiate this challenge. Against this background, records from the Health and Safety Executives show year on year reductions in accident and incident rates in the East Midlands, an indication that the safety practices on projects are being implemented more effectively. Some of this success has been attributed to the efforts of local safety groups, such as Nottinghamshire Occupational Safety and Health Association (NOSHA). As such, {{it is important that the}} interdependencies between large <b>principal</b> <b>contractors</b> and micro firms, and the role that safety groups such as NOSHA play in managing this relationship are better understood. This paper presents interviews conducted with some members of NOSHA. This is the first of two phases of empirical work. The roles that the members of the local safety group perform have been found to go beyond simply promoting safety awareness and safety knowledge on site. They have been found to help in conflict resolution among the various construction parties. Such practices help create a harmonious working environment and subsequently lead to long-term working relations...|$|R
