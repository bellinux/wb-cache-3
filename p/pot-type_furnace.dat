40|$|The {{indirect}} resistance heating {{is one of}} {{many ways}} of heating a melting charge. It is used in metallurgy, mostly for melting of soft metals. Its principle is a direct resistance heating in correspondence with the JouleÂ´s law. The principle of indirect resistance heating is in generating of thermal energy in heating element and heat transferring this heat into the melting charge. The theoretical part of this Bachelor Work (the first three chapters) is focused to thermal energy generation and possibility of thermal transmittance. The fourth chapter is devoted to possibility of utilizing of the indirect heating in praxis. The simplest general design and calculation of a <b>pot-type</b> <b>furnace</b> for aluminium melting is done in the fifth chapter. There is a part in this chapter, which deals with the effectivity of the designed <b>pot-type</b> <b>furnace</b> and possibility of heating optimalization in case when indirect heating system is used. The input and calculated parameters of our designed furnace are summed up in the conclusion. There is also comparison of the designed furnace and a furnace readily available on the Czech market and stress on importance of optimalization of heating at indirect heating systems...|$|E
