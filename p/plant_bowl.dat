5000|$|In 1968 the Plain Dealer reported: [...] "Colt Industries Inc. has {{acquired}} Holley Carburetor Co., of Warren, Michigan, following approval by directors of both companies. Holley Carburetor which makes auto ignition systems and aviation fuel controls, employs about 3,000 at four facilities in three states." [...] At {{this time the}} corporate, engineering and sales headquarters were in Warren, with <b>plants</b> in <b>Bowling</b> Green, Kentucky; Paris, Tennessee and Clare, Michigan. Holley {{was said to have}} a turnover of $40 million in 1967. At the time of the sale the company was primarily owned by members of the Holley family.|$|R
25|$|Minor renovations to the {{property}} began in 1913, but a fire on February 11, 1917, destroyed the hotel's bottling <b>plant,</b> opera house, <b>bowling</b> alley and hospital, forcing their replacement. Several {{years prior to the}} fires, hotel owner Lee Sinclair's health began to fail and his daughter, Lillian, and her husband, Charles Wexford, took over the hotel's operation. When Sinclair died in 1916, management of the hotel was left {{in the hands of the}} Wexfords.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company was}} sold to Roy Burlew in 1918 who used it to create the Kentucky Radio Corporation, later known as Ken-Rad, which {{operated}} {{out of the same}} building. Burlew grew the company significantly as the lamp plant continued to grow, Burlew expanded into the manufacturing of vacuum tubes for radios in 1922. Within seven years of purchasing the company it had expanded with <b>plants</b> in <b>Bowling</b> Green, Kentucky and Tell City and Huntingburg, Indiana. The manufacturing company supplied the light bulbs for the first Major League Baseball game played at night. The game was played on May 24, 1935, between the Cincinnati Reds and the Philadelphia Phillies at Cincinnati's Crosley Field. In 1943, Burlew sold the lamp division which he acquired in 1918 for $55,000 to the Westinghouse Electric Corporation in exchange of 35,000 shares of that company's stock valued at $1,600,000.|$|R
40|$|Because of the {{potential}} health hazards {{associated with the use}} of sludge for agricultural purposes, Dudley et al (1980) published a scheme for the routine analysis of bacteria in municipal sewage sludge. In this study, the Dudley et al scheme (1980) was modified by updating some of the procedures. Aerobically digested sludge generated by the Bowling Green Wastewater Treatment <b>Plant,</b> <b>Bowling</b> Green, Kentucky, was analyzed using the modified scheme. Sludge samples were collected once every two months over a one-year period from October 1989 to August 1990. Egg yolk-free tryptose sulfite cycloserine agar in conjunction with the revewrse CAMP test was used to assay for Clostridium perfringens. This procedure improved the one proposed by Dudley et al. (1980) by achieving a higher confirmation rate, reducing testing time, allowing for easier interpretation of results, and increasing accuracy. Selective and differential media by Rippey and Cabelli (1979) were added to the scheme to isolate Aeromonas, Aeroomonas hydrophila and Aeromonas caviae were successfully isolated wand were identified using the system by Cunliffe and Adcock (1989) for speciating aeromonads. Baird-Parker medium was compared to mannitol salt agar for effectiveness in isolating Staphylococcus from sludge. Statistical analysis showed Baird-Parker medium to be significantly more effective than mannitol salt agar. However, neither agar reduced background flora to acceptable levels. Staphylococcus isolates were subject to species identification by the API Staph Ident system (Analytab Products, Plainview, New York). Staphylococcus xylosus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were found to be present in the sludge. A procedure by Ottolenghi and Hamparian (1987) was employed to isolate Salmonella in sludge. No salmonellae were isolated over the one year period. Over the year-long study, bacterial numbers, with the exception of Clostridium perfringens and the total aerobic count, fluctuated with variations in the aerobic digester temperature. Numbers decreased as temperature increased. Clostridium perfringens counts were the most consistent throughout the year and exceeded fecal coliform and fecal streptococci counts in five of the six samplings...|$|R

50|$|Marcgravia evenia {{relies on}} Monophyllus, a Cuban nectar-feeding bat, for pollination. This <b>plant</b> has evolved <b>bowl</b> shaped leaves which act as reflectors for a bat's biosonar. This helps the bats {{to find the}} plants with greater ease and hence {{pollinate}} them with more frequency. The shape of the leaves also helps to guide the bats in locating the hidden feeders. The reflectors are convergent with those of a Bornean pitcher plant, Nepenthes hemsleyana, that attracts bats to its pitchers as roosting sites and uses bat guano {{as a source of}} nutrition.|$|R
5000|$|The solar bowl design {{resulted}} from a project of the Electrical Engineering Department of the Texas Technical University, headed by Edwin O'Hair, to develop a 5 MWe power <b>plant.</b> A solar <b>bowl</b> was built for the town of Crosbyton, Texas as a pilot facility. The bowl had a diameter of 65 ft, tilted at a 15° angle to optimize the cost/yield relation (33° would have maximized yield). The rim of the hemisphere was [...] "trimmed" [...] to 60°, creating a maximum aperture of 3318 sq ft. This pilot bowl produced electricity {{at a rate of}} 10 kW peak.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{research}} {{on the effect of}} composition ratio on drying quality of the plant bowl-seeding tray, the drying test was done in superheated steam drying test-bed, the regression model was established by performance test data, and the best composition ratio was obtained from optimization results, the best composition ratio is 21 : 7 : 1 : 4, at this condition the dry strength value was 0. 2112 MPa, the wet strength value was 0. 2178 Mpa. The research results has important meaning to enhance the drying quality of the rice seedling-growing tray made of paddy-straw and to promote <b>planting</b> techniques of <b>bowl</b> sterile...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{interior}} view of the den in George Wharton James residence, showing {{a tremendous number of}} Native American artifacts, Pasadena, ca. 1908. The shelves, which were constructed close the to ceiling, house numerous vases and baskets. These vases and baskets all have unique designs and drawings on them. Two short totem poles sit on the shelf directly above a large tribal mask and a wooden cushioned bench. Over a dozen unique rugs (or blankets?) hang from their individual poles mounted on the wall. On the ceiling hang several jugs at the upper left. In the left foreground is a wooden table covered with similar patterned rugs as those that are hanging. On top of the table are two vases, one with a <b>plant,</b> and a <b>bowl.</b> A thick rug and a leopard skin rug cover the wooden floor...|$|R
60|$|Notwithstanding {{the absence}} of all comfort and {{convenience}} in their habitations, and the general squalidness of their appearance, the Shoshokoes {{do not appear to}} be destitute of ingenuity. They manufacture good ropes, and even a tolerably fine thread, from a sort of weed found in their neighborhood; and construct bowls and jugs out of a kind of basket-work formed from small strips of wood plaited: these, by the aid of a little wax, they render perfectly water tight. Beside the roots on which they mainly depend for subsistence, they collect great quantities of seed, of various kinds, beaten with one hand out of the tops of the <b>plants</b> into wooden <b>bowls</b> held for that purpose. The seed thus collected is winnowed and parched, and ground between two stones into a kind of meal or flour; which, when mixed with water, forms a very palatable paste or gruel.|$|R
5000|$|She married {{financier}} Horatio Gates Lloyd, Jr., and redesigned {{the gardens}} on their estate, Allgates, in Haverford, Pennsylvania. The main house at Allgates {{was designed by}} Philadelphia architect Wilson Eyre, and the estate {{is now on the}} National Register of Historic Places. The centerpiece of Lloyd's landscaping was a bowl-shaped iris garden roughly 100 feet in diameter, consisting of four concentric terraces descending to a sunken grassy area with a tiled pool in the middle. By 1921, some 250 varieties of irises were <b>planted</b> in the <b>bowl,</b> with shorter irises towards the bottom. The bowl was divided into quadrants by stone staircases, and each quadrant was planted using a different color scheme, which Lloyd altered several times over the years. John Caspar Wister, the first president of the American Iris Society (AIS), held that it was [...] "by far the finest" [...] of the private iris gardens of the time.|$|R
5000|$|While Jerry trudges up {{and down}} in the heavy snow in a vain attempt to warm himself, Tom fluffs up his cushion and prepares to sleep. He is unable to settle himself; heavenly choirs sing carols, {{pricking}} Toms conscience with the message of Christmas peace and goodwill. He first props open the slot to allow Jerry back in and when the mouse does not reappear, ventures anxiously outside to find Jerry, frozen. Fearing for Jerrys life, he brings the frozen mouse indoors and warms him up by the fire, saving his life. Slowly, Jerry regains consciousness, but is wary of the cat. Tom hands Jerry a candy cane, his Christmas present. A delighted Jerry licks his cane, but then quickly reacts to prevent Tom drinking from his bowl of milk. He dips his cane into the bowl and a loud snap is heard. Jerry uses the cane to fish a mousetrap that he had earlier <b>planted</b> in the <b>bowl.</b> Tom appreciates Jerrys warning and the mouse runs back to his hole. He uses his candy cane to hook the cheese off the mousetrap. Instead of snapping like a usual mousetrap does, the spring slowly comes down, ringing the tune of [...] "Jingle Bells" [...] as Jerry smiles in admiration to the [...] "musical mousetrap".|$|R

Several {{years prior to the}} fires, hotel owner Lee Sinclair's health began to fail and his daughter, Lillian, and her husband, Charles Wexford, took over the hotel's operation. When Sinclair died in 1916, management of the hotel was left {{in the hands of the}} Wexfords. Charles Wexford opposed any major enhancements, but Lillian ignored his wishes and began a major restoration of the hotel in a Greco-Roman architectural style. Between 1917 and 1919, Italian artisans installed a mosaic terrazzo tile floor composed of two million one-inch squares of marble in the atrium. The atrium fireplace was refaced with glazed ceramic tiles from the Rookwood Pottery Company. Marble wainscotting was added to the atrium's ground level walls, while the brick support columns were wrapped with canvas and painted to resemble marble. Outside, an elaborate veranda was constructed. Wooden shelters at the springs were replaced with brick structures, and a sunken garden was created with a fountain featuring an angel. [...] Edward Ballard, who financed the hotel's improvements, began his career as a bowling alley worker in the hotel, but made a fortune by operating an illegal gambling business in the area. Ballard also owned several nationally-recognized touring circuses, including the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus. Between 1918 and 1919, while the hotel was being refurbished, it served as a U.S. Army hospital for wounded soldiers returning from World War I. Lillian Wexford and Lieutenant Charles Cooper fell in love during his stay at the hotel-hospital. The Rexfords divorced in 1922, and Lillian sold {{the property}} to Ballard for $1 million in 1923. Half the money repaid the debt owed to Ballard; Lillian she kept the remainder.|$|R
