40|$|The {{overall goal}} of the Sand Creek Watershed <b>Project</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> improve and protect the {{designated}} uses of the watershed. In order to achieve this overall goal and attain compliance with the TMDL established in Sand Creek, four goals have been established and prioritized. The primary {{goal of the}} Sand Creek Watershed <b>Project</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> restore or improve the cold water fishery. The secondary goal of the <b>project</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> protect and improve the habitats of native aquatic life and wildlife. Both goals {{can be achieved by}} reducing the amount of known pollutants affecting both of these uses. Pollutant reduction can be achieved through proper storm water management that would also serve to address harmful changes in the stream’s flow regime. The third goal of the <b>project</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> improve and protect partial body contact recreational uses, such as wading and fishing, by reducing pathogen concentrations, hydrocarbons, toxic substances, and trash. These four known and suspected pollutants also affect total body contact recreation uses, such as swimming. The fourth goal of the Sand Creek Watershed <b>Project</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> improve and protect total body contact. Structural and vegetative BMPs, policy and management BMPs, and Information and Education (I 2 ̆ 6 E) activities will <b>be</b> needed <b>to</b> reduce known pollutants affecting these impaired and threatened uses...|$|R
5|$|An {{engineering}} report {{dating back}} to 1961 suggested that building a bypass around the last two mainline tunnels {{was the best way}} to solve the congestion. The Commission awarded three contracts to construct the bypass from July 1966 to March 1967. The contracts cost $17.2 million for roadway and another $2.5 million for construction of a new Sideling Hill Service Plaza to replace the Cove Valley Service Plaza, which was along the to-be-bypassed alignment. The $2.5 million <b>project</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> include ramps from both directions to the service plaza, so it could serve both directions. The style of the tunnel bypass was to follow the same style as the Laurel Hill bypass. On November 26, 1968, the three twinned tunnels opened, and the bypass of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels opened. The new bypass also opened the Breezewood Interchange and the number of lanes along the turnpike expanded to four (two in each direction) or five (two in each direction, plus a climbing lane going uphill).|$|E
5|$|In 1930, efforts {{began to}} turn a city dump into a landmark. The <b>project</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{construct}} a municipal stadium (now called Modern Woodmen Park). The project was financed by bonds, and cost more than $150,000. Special features included reserved seats, box seats, and night lighting. The stadium was home to the Saint Ambrose University football games, and boxing matches. Today the stadium {{is home to the}} Quad Cities River Bandits baseball team. By 1932, thousands of Davenporters were on public relief due to the Great Depression. A shantytown grew in the west end of the city along the Mississippi River. Sickness, hunger, and unsanitary living conditions plagued the area. Through county and municipal government, the federal Civil Works Administration gave employment to thousands of men. They worked to extend the seawall along the riverfront. More than 200 jobs were created by the construction of Lock and Dam 15 project, in 1932. Hundreds of state employees worked on completing the Kimberly Road Outerbelt Bypass in 1936.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the New Jersey Department of Transportation {{proposed}} {{the elimination of}} the Netcong Traffic Circle, located at the intersections of U.S. Route 46 and Route 183 just north of the interchange with Interstate 80. The <b>project</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> produce two outcomes: replacement of the New Jersey Transit bridge that Route 183 crosses, and {{the elimination of the}} Netcong Circle with a signalized intersection. The project had issues dealing with the vertical clearance of the overpass for U.S. Route 46 westbound. The removal of the circle would eliminate this bridge, and the land would go to use as the new signalized intersection, with pedestrian and bicycle fittings. The entire project cost about $13.3 million (2009 USD) of state and local funds to construct. The Netcong Circle was replaced with a temporary junction in January 2013; the permanent intersection configuration opened in August of that year. The new bridge over the New Jersey Transit line opened in March 2013.|$|E

5|$|In June 1999, the {{contract}} to jointly develop and produce the Chengdu FC-1/Super 7 was signed. The <b>project</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be a 50:50 partnership; the air forces of both countries would be committed to ordering the fighter. After GEC-Marconi had abandoned the bidding to supply an integrated avionics suite, FIAR and Thomson-CSF proposed a number of avionics suites based on the Grifo S7 and RC400 radars respectively, despite previously hoping to use the PAF's Super 7 to launch its new Blue Hawk radar. Because of sanctions placed on Pakistan after the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests, design work progressed very slowly over the next 18 months, preventing delivery of the Western avionics to the PAF. In early 2001, the PAF decided to decouple the airframe from the avionics, enabling design work on the aircraft to continue. As the airframe was developed, any new avionics requirements by the PAF could be more easily integrated into the airframe.|$|E
5|$|Project A119, {{also known}} as A Study of Lunar Research Flights, was a top-secret plan {{developed}} in 1958 by the United States Air Force. The aim of the <b>project</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> detonate a nuclear bomb on the Moon which would help in answering some of the mysteries in planetary astronomy and astrogeology. If the explosive device detonated on the surface, not in a lunar crater, the flash of explosive light would have been faintly visible to people on earth with their naked eye, {{a show of force}} resulting in a possible boosting of domestic morale in the capabilities of the United States, a boost that was needed after the Soviet Union took an early lead in the Space Race and was also working on a similar project.|$|E

This started the process of Norway becoming a full member of ESA in 1987. The telemetry station received investments of NOK100 million during the 1980s and was organized as a foundation in 1984. It took the name Tromsø Satellite Station in 1988.

5|$|The Seinfeld Chronicles {{was written}} as the pilot {{for the show}} that would {{eventually}} be called Seinfeld, though earlier versions of the script would refer to the program as Stand Up and The Jerry Seinfeld Show. The idea for the show started on November 2, 1988, after NBC executives had approached comedian Jerry Seinfeld to do a project with the network, upon a suggestion by George Shapiro, Seinfeld's manager at the time. Seinfeld enlisted fellow comedian Larry David to help him develop it, and they wrote a concept for a special about where comedians get their material. However, upon further discussion, Seinfeld felt that the concept could not be sustained for 90 minutes, upon which the two decided that the <b>project</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> become a pilot for a TV-series, rather than a special. Developed by NBC executive Rick Ludwin, and produced by Castle Rock Entertainment, it was a mix of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy routines and idiosyncratic, conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life.|$|E
