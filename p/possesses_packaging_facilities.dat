40|$|An {{essential}} element of the Test and Evaluation Facility (TEF) is a waste <b>packaging</b> <b>facility</b> capable of producing a small number Test and Evaluation <b>Facility</b> of <b>packages</b> consisting of several different waste forms. The study envisions three scenarios for such a packaging facility: (1) modify an existing hot cell facility such as the Engine Maintenance Assembly and Disassembly (EMAD) facility at the Nevada Test Site {{so that it can}} serve as a <b>packaging</b> <b>facility</b> for the TEF. This scenario {{is referred to as the}} EMAD Option. (2) Build a new generic <b>packaging</b> <b>facility</b> (GPF) at the site of the TEF. In other words, colocate the GPF and the TEF. This scenario is referred to as the GPF Option, and (3) utilize the EMAD facility in conjunction with a colocated GPF (of minimal size and scope) at the TEF. This scenario is referred to as the Split Option. The results of the system study clearly bring out the fact that transportation has a significant impact on the selection and siting of the waste <b>packaging</b> <b>facility.</b> Preliminary conclusions, subject to the assumptions of the study, include the following: (1) regardless of the waste form, the GPF option is preferable to the other two in minimizing both transportation costs and logistical problems, (2) for any given scenario and choice of waste forms, there exists a candidate TEF location for which the transportation costs are at a minimum compared to the other locations, (3) in spite of the increased transportation costs and logistical complexity, the study shows that the overall system costs favor modification of an existing hot cell facility for the particular case considered...|$|R

40|$|Selection of {{an optimal}} {{facility}} location is a challenging decision for companies, {{since it would}} be costly and dicult to change the location after an installation has been already made. Existing numerical methods {{in the decision-making process}} help companies to perform their operations with minimum cost and maximum value based on their strategic objectives. Decision making process requires the selection of relative processes among several alternatives corresponding to a set of location factors. It can be performed by multi criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods with the point of individuals or a group of decision makers. This study provides a suitable country selection process for a new <b>packaging</b> <b>facility</b> location problem. The problem is formulated by using a combination of fuzzy AHP and TOPSIS, which are the methods for MCDM problems. Since the available information for weighting the factors is subjective and imprecise, fuzzy AHP is used for determining the relative importance of the factors. Afterwards to select the best suitable country, the scores of alternatives are quantied by means of TOPSIS method. Later the results are presented, and the obtained solutions are discussed. Latvia is found as the best country for the new <b>packaging</b> <b>facility.</b> Further, using sensitivity analysis we found that the most stable countries according to predetermined factors were Latvia and Poland...|$|R
