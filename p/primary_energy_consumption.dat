40|$|The {{mismatch}} between the energy demand and energy supply {{is one of}} the major problems in low or zero energy buildings with distributed power generations. The policy of time-sensitive electricity pricing provides a possibility to improve the energy efficiency of the building energy systems. A model predictive control (MPC) -based strategy using nonlinear programming (NLP) algorithm is proposed to optimize the scheduling of the energy systems under day-ahead electricity pricing. Evaluations are conducted using a reference building based on the Hong Kong Zero Carbon Building. A stratified chilled water storage tank is introduced as the thermal energy storage, which makes possible to optimize the scheduling of the building energy systems. The distributed power generation in the building consists of a combined cooling and power system and a photovoltaic (PV) system.

In this scenario the Thermo–Photo–Voltaic generation (TPV) is obtaining an increasing attention; TPV is a system to convert into electrical energy the radiation emitted from an artificial heat source (i. e. the combustion of fuel) by the use of photovoltaic cells. A domestic gas furnace based on this technology can provide the entire thermal need of an apartment and can also contributes to satisfy the electrical demand.
