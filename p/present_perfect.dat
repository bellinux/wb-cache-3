25|$|The Absolute Past has a {{function}} {{distinct from the}} <b>Present</b> <b>Perfect.</b> It is used for events which are distant from the present and no longer directly affect it, for example when telling a story, whereas the <b>Present</b> <b>Perfect</b> is used for more recent events which may have {{a direct impact on}} the present. The Absolute Past may at all times be replaced with the <b>Present</b> <b>Perfect</b> (but not vice versa). In many areas of Southern Italy, it is still used commonly in spoken language, whereas in Northern-Central Italy and Sardinia it is restricted to written language.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{provides}} both a cross-linguistic/diachronical typology and {{a formal}} account of (<b>present)</b> <b>perfects.</b> They are treated here as resultative viewpoint tenses, combining insights from both Parson's (1990) and Smith's (1991) aspectual theories. It {{is a well-known}} cross-linguistic fact that perfects tend to evolve towards perfective viewpoint tenses, following a so-called perfect continuum in their evolution. Along this continuum from <b>present</b> <b>perfects</b> to past perfectives, we believe that (at least) three broad classes of <b>present</b> <b>perfects</b> can be identified, depending on whether {{they are capable of}} (1) describing temporal sequences of events and/or (2) describing temporal sequences of events in discourse. The first criterion hinges on the compositional semantics of perfects, while the second hinges on the interpretation of perfects at the semantics/pragmatics interface [...] it crucially involves the rhetorical structure of discourse. A SDRT account of the three classes of perfects is proposed here, drawing on the explicit implementation of the semantics/pragmatics interface provided by this framework. It is claimed that of one these three classes, embodied by the passé composé in Middle French, proves that tenses possess an arbitrary, conventional pragmatic contribution paving the way for future semantic changes...|$|R

25|$|Pashto is a subject–object–verb (SOV) {{language}} with split ergativity. Adjectives come before nouns. Nouns and adjectives are inflected for two genders (masc./fem.), two numbers (sing./plur.), and four cases (direct, oblique I, oblique II and vocative). There {{is also an}} inflection for the subjunctive mood. The verb system is very intricate with the following tenses: present, simple past, past progressive, <b>present</b> <b>perfect</b> and past perfect. The sentence construction of Pashto has similarities with some other Indo-Iranian languages such as Prakrit and Bactrian. The possessor precedes the possessed in the genitive construction. The verb generally agrees with the subject in both transitive and intransitive sentences. An exception occurs when a completed action is reported {{in any of the}} past tenses (simple past, past progressive, <b>present</b> <b>perfect</b> or past perfect). In such cases, the verb agrees with the subject if it is intransitive, but if it is transitive, it agrees with the object, therefore Pashto shows a partly ergative behavior. Like Kurdish, but unlike most other Indo-Iranian languages, Pashto uses all three types of adpositions – prepositions, postpositions and circumpositions.|$|E
