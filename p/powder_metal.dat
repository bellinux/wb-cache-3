500|$|Plain carbon-iron alloys with {{a higher}} than 2.1% carbon content are known as cast iron. [...] With modern {{steelmaking}} techniques such as <b>powder</b> <b>metal</b> forming, {{it is possible to}} make very high-carbon (and other alloy material) steels, but such are not common. Cast iron is not malleable even when hot, but it can be formed by casting as it has a lower melting point than steel and good castability properties. [...] Certain compositions of cast iron, while retaining the economies of melting and casting, can be heat treated after casting to make malleable iron or ductile iron objects. Steel is also distinguishable from wrought iron (now largely obsolete), which may contain a small amount of carbon but large amounts of slag.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The yield {{criterion}} describing asymmetric behavior of <b>powdered</b> <b>metal</b> compacts in tension and compression is introduced by modifying that used for sintered <b>powdered</b> <b>metals.</b> The plasticity theory {{related to the}} modified {{yield criterion}} is reviewed and summarized for a <b>powdered</b> <b>metal</b> compact. The constitutive equation {{is applied to the}} variational principle and its discritization is also introduced. Axisymmetric die pressings with copper powders were performed to see the deformation mechanics of hollow three-level parts. The simulation includes two different types of multiple-motion tooling compaction of a Class IV part of hollow three-level component. Predictions are made for density distributions, load-stroke relationships, average density as function of height, pressure distributions along the die-walls and punches, average compact densities at each level, and energy consumption for each pressing. The information from simulation can be used to synthesize the various punch motions in a multiple action tooling system...|$|R
