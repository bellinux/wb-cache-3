There is a late nineteenth or early twentieth century half-timbered private residence known as The Hermitage, supposedly constructed on the remains of a Celtic chapel.

40|$|DURINGTHE PAST TWENTY years, {{the school}} library has emerged as {{the school library}} media center. The school library of the past functioned as a central <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>depositing</b> books, periodicals, and {{pamphlets}} for use by students and teachers as needed. Reference materials did not circu-late. Few, if any, nonbook resources were found in the library. Instruc-tion in the use of resources was minimal and not related to the curriculum. The collection was well-organized, silence was the basic rule, and the librarian worked in isolation from teachers. The school library, which mainly existed at the secondary level, was viewed, at best, as an educational support service. Federal funds granted through the Elementary and Secondary Edu-cation Act of 1965 and of 1975 along with technological advancements had a tremendous impact on education. In many schools, the traditional classroom became the open classroom. The textbook was replaced by a multi-media approach to teaching and learning. Team teaching became common, as did individualized instruction and independent study. Teaching and learning moved from rote memorization to an emphasis on discovery, inquiry, problem solving, comprehension, and utilization. The educational changes of the 1960 s and 1970 s have shaped the development of the school library of the 1980 s. The school library media center has become the “laboratory and workshop ” envisioned as early as 1913 by Lucille F. Fargo. ’ Print and nonprint media are availabl...|$|E

Amongthose elements that structure the funerary space, the enclosure trench, understood as a delimiting characteristic or a <b>place</b> <b>for</b> the <b>deposit</b> of objects, seems to have been of decreasing importance. The age of the deceased affects the choice of siting of the grave and treatment of the body, while deposits of grave goods seem little linked to the age of the deceased. An exception to this observation is objects of apotropaic value, which are more frequently found in the graves of the young. On the other hand, gender seems to play a role of little importance and has little influence on the composition of deposits of terracotta and glass objects. Slight differences are seen however in drinking ware, which are frequent and of greater volume in the graves of deceased males...|$|R

40|$|This study {{assess the}} impact of human waste and {{household}} garbage on the concentrations of heavy metals in arable land on two sites located close either to a waste collecting point (WD) or waste water treatment plant (WWTP). Malawi suffers from poverty, low food security and problems with access to land. The aim was {{to find out if the}} assessed areas are contaminated with heavy metals and to evaluate the results and the land use in a historical, social and political context. Another objective is to evaluate the possible positive effects the waste can give in form of plant nutrients against the potential harmful effect that comes from heavy metal contamination. Soil and plant samples were collected from the three sites, and the concentration of Cd, Zn, Cu and Fe was measured with atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) at the University of Malawi. After evaluation of the results, some samples were brought to Sweden for a second AAS-analysis for Cd, Pb and Cr. Unfortunately the results for Cd were considered unreliable and were therefore not used in the assessment. The concentration of metals in the soil was then compared with the general guideline values calculated by the Swedish Agency for Environmental Projection. In the comparison WD and WWTP both showed concentrations of Pb exceeding the general guideline value. The concentration of Pb found was much higher than expected, and the results need to be treated with care. The sites had both a higher soil concentration of N and P compared with a reference site. The study was limited by time constraints and hampered by broken equipment. However, the results can be used for planning a more detailed risk assessment of the areas. Future actions suggested in this study are: a more detailed risk assessment of metal pollution and hygienic aspects, updated information about background levels of metals in soil, control of Cd-content in imported fertilisers and an overall focus on ensuring access to agricultural land and input as well as secure <b>places</b> <b>for</b> <b>depositing</b> waste...|$|R

40|$|The now-defunct Research Quality Framework (RQF) {{required}} all Australian {{higher education}} facilities to create open access institutional repositories for the storage and archival of university research outputs. Most universities followed the University of Southampton model of open access by pursuing mandates for authors to self-submit to their repositories. This well-established workflow <b>places</b> the onus <b>for</b> <b>depositing</b> research, managing copyright and creating metadata on authors, {{and as a}} consequence has typically achieved low contribution rates. Swinburne Research Bank repository managers have pursued a different, more involved, service model-bringing the repository to the researchers, rather than waiting for them to come to the repository. By maintaining responsibility for content sourcing, metadata creation, copyright permissions and deposit, Swinburne has been able to provide a more personalised service to its researchers. This model increases the workload for repository managers, but allows them to build valuable working relationships with individual researchers and research groups, and to gain access to a breadth of research material beyond the scope of HERDC requirements. This engaged, user-centred approach to content recruitment has seen high rates of contribution, and authors have even begun to actively contribute work <b>for</b> <b>deposit.</b> In this paper, we describe the rationale and outcomes of our unique approach, and propose a way forward for content recruitment in institutional repositories...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: New {{editions of}} the TNM staging system for {{colorectal}} cancer {{have been subject to}} extensive criticism. In the current study, we evaluate each edition of TNM and analyze stage migration caused by the different versions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two independent test populations were used: participants derived from a randomized surgical trial from the United Kingdom (n = 455) and patients from a population-based series from Sweden (n = 505). All slides from these patient cases were reviewed with special attention for the presence of tumor deposits. Tumor deposits were classified according to the fifth, sixth, and seventh editions of TNM and correlated with prognosis. RESULTS: Every change in edition of TNM led to a stage migration of between 33 % and 64 % in patients with tumor deposits. Reproducibility was best in the fifth edition of TNM. The prognostic value of the seventh edition was best only when all tumor deposits irrespective of size or contour were included as lymph nodes. The prognostic value of the fifth edition was better than that of the sixth. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate there is a <b>place</b> <b>for</b> tumor <b>deposits</b> in the staging of patients with colorectal cancer. However, many questions remain about their definition and the reproducibility and use of this category in special situations, such as after neoadjuvant treatment. These should be the subject of additional research before use as a factor in TNM staging. This work demonstrates the necessity of testing modifications before their introduction...|$|R

50|$|Thieme {{considered}} it {{his job as}} a pastor-teacher to study and teach Bible doctrine daily in order for positive believers to grow to spiritual maturity and receive their supergrace blessings. He identified biblical passages where God is said to be waiting to provide these blessings to believers. In one such passage in Ephesians 1:3, Thieme concluded that supergrace blessings were <b>placed</b> on <b>deposit</b> <b>for</b> every believer before the creation of mankind, but are conveyed to the believer only at spiritual maturity. Though no believer can ever lose salvation, the believer who fails to advance to spiritual maturity forfeits his supergrace blessings, and receives discipline from God in time. What is lacking in the immature or reversionistic believer is capacity of soul, and that capacity is acquired only through persistent spiritual growth and exercise of the mechanics for the spiritual life.|$|R
