25|$|Two {{theories}} dominate – that in vivo uptake of DNA occurs non-specifically, in {{a method}} similar to phago- or <b>pinocytosis,</b> or through specific receptors. These might include a 30kDa surface receptor, or macrophage scavenger receptors. The 30kDa surface receptor binds specifically to 4500-bp DNA fragments (which are then internalised) and is found on professional APCs and T-cells. Macrophage scavenger receptors bind {{to a variety}} of macromolecules, including polyribonucleotides and are thus candidates for DNA uptake. Receptor-mediated DNA uptake could be facilitated by the presence of polyguanylate sequences. Gene gun delivery systems, cationic liposome packaging, and other delivery methods bypass this entry method, but understanding it may be useful in reducing costs (e.g. by reducing the requirement for cytofectins), which could be important in animal husbandry.|$|E
25|$|As in {{all forms}} of {{necrotic}} cell death, cells undergoing necroptosis rupture and leak their contents into the intercellular space. Unlike in necrosis, permeabilization of the cell membrane during necroptosis is tightly regulated. While many of these mechanisms and components of the pathway are still being uncovered, the major steps of necroptotic signaling have been outlined in recent years. First, extrinsic stimulus through the TNF receptor by TNFα signals the recruitment of the TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) which in turn recruits RIPK1. In the absence of active Caspase 8, RIPK1 and RIPK3 auto- and transphosphorylate each other, leading {{to the formation of}} a microfilament-like complex called the necrosome. The necrosome then activates the pro-necroptotic protein MLKL via phosphorylation. MLKL actuates the necrosis phenotype by inserting into the bilipid membranes of organelles and plasma membrane leading to expulsion of cellular contents into the extracellular space. The inflammatory rupturing of the cell releases Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) into the extracellular space. Many of these DAMPs remain unidentified, however, the “find me” and “eat me” DAMP signals are known to recruit immune cells to the damaged/infected tissue. Necrotic cells are cleared from the immune system by a mechanism called <b>pinocytosis,</b> or cellular drinking, which is mediated by macropinosomes, a subcellular component of macrophages. This process is in contrast to removal of apoptotic cells by the immune system in which cells are removed via phagocytosis, or cellular eating.|$|E
500|$|The binding of a {{specific}} antigen with corresponding BCR molecules results in increased production of the MHC-II molecules. This assumes significance as the same does not happen when the same antigen would be internalized by a relatively nonspecific process called <b>pinocytosis,</b> in which the antigen with the surrounding fluid is [...] "drunk" [...] as a small vesicle by the B cell. Hence, such an antigen {{is known as a}} nonspecific antigen and does not lead to activation of the B cell, or subsequent production of antibodies against it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pinocytosis</b> is used {{primarily}} for the absorption of extracellular fluids (ECF). In contrast to phagocytosis, it generates very small amounts of ATP from the wastes of alternative substances such as lipids (fat). Unlike receptor-mediated endocytosis, <b>pinocytosis</b> is nonspecific in the substances that it transports. The cell takes in surrounding fluids, including all solutes present. <b>Pinocytosis</b> also works as phagocytosis; {{the only difference is}} that phagocytosis is specific in the substances it transports. Phagocytosis engulfs whole particles, which are later broken down by enzymes, such as cathepsins, and absorbed into the cells. <b>Pinocytosis,</b> on the other hand, is when the cell engulfs already-dissolved or broken-down food.|$|E

50|$|Biologists {{distinguish}} {{two main}} types of endocytosis: <b>pinocytosis</b> and phagocytosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pinocytosis</b> is {{non-specific}} and non-absorptive. Molecule-specific endocytosis {{is called}} receptor-mediated endocytosis.|$|E
5000|$|Some amoebae also feed by <b>pinocytosis,</b> imbibing {{dissolved}} nutrients through vesicles formed {{within the}} cell membrane [...]|$|E
50|$|Receptor-mediated {{endocytosis}} is {{a mode of}} <b>pinocytosis.</b> Proteins in the clathrin coat on {{the plasma}} membrane have propensity to bind and trap macromolecules or ligands. However, {{it is not the}} receptors in the pit that caused the <b>pinocytosis.</b> The vesicles would have formed {{regardless of whether or not}} the receptors and ligand were there. This is why it is still a continuous non-triggered event, unlike phagocytosis which is explained below.|$|E

5000|$|In <b>pinocytosis,</b> cells engulf liquid {{particles}} (in humans {{this process}} {{occurs in the}} small intestine, where cells engulf fat droplets).|$|E
50|$|In {{cellular}} biology, <b>pinocytosis,</b> {{otherwise known}} as cell drinking, fluid endocytosis, and bulk-phase <b>pinocytosis,</b> is a mode of endocytosis in which small particles are brought into the cell, forming an invagination, and then suspended within small vesicles. These pinocytotic vesicles subsequently fuse with lysosomes to hydrolyze (break down) the particles. This process requires {{energy in the form}} of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the chemical compound mostly used as energy in the majority of animal cells.|$|E
50|$|In animals, vacuoles {{serve in}} {{exocytosis}} and endocytosis processes. Endocytosis refers to when substances {{are taken into}} the cell, whereas for exocytosis substances are moved from the cell into the extracellular space. Material to be taken-in is surrounded by the plasma membrane, and then transferred to a vacuole. There {{are two types of}} endocytosis, phagocytosis (cell eating) and <b>pinocytosis</b> (cell drinking). In phagocytosis, cells engulf large particles such as bacteria. <b>Pinocytosis</b> is the same process, except the substances being ingested are in the fluid form.|$|E
5000|$|The word <b>pinocytosis</b> (...) uses {{combining}} {{forms of}} pino- + [...] + , all New Latin from Greek, reflecting píno, to drink, and cytosis. The term was proposed by W. H. Lewis in 1931.|$|E
50|$|Granzyme B {{has also}} been {{proposed}} to enter a target by first exchanging its bound serglycin for negative phospholipids in a target's plasma membrane. Entry then occurs by the less selective process of absorptive <b>pinocytosis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Non-specific, adsorptive <b>pinocytosis</b> {{is a form}} of endocytosis, {{a process}} in which small {{particles}} are taken in by a cell by splitting off small vesicles from the cell surface. [...] Cationic proteins bind to the negative cell surface and are taken up via the clathrin-mediated system, thus the uptake is intermediate between receptor-mediated endocytosis and non-specific, non-adsorptive <b>pinocytosis.</b> The clathrin-coated pits occupy about 2% of the surface area of the cell and only last about a minute, with an estimated 2500 leaving the average cell surface each minute. The clathrin coats are lost almost immediately, and the membrane is subsequently recycled to the cell surface.|$|E
50|$|Endocytosis is {{the reverse}} of {{exocytosis}} and can occur {{in a variety of}} forms. Phagocytosis ("cell eating") is the process by which bacteria, dead tissue, or other bits of material visible under the microscope are engulfed by cells. The material makes contact with the cell membrane, which then invaginates. The invagination is pinched off, leaving the engulfed material in the membrane-enclosed vacuole and the cell membrane intact. <b>Pinocytosis</b> ("cell drinking") is essentially the same process, the difference being that the substances ingested are in solution and not visible under the microscope. Phagocytosis and <b>pinocytosis</b> are both undertaken in association with lysosomes which complete the breakdown of the material which has been engulfed.|$|E
50|$|Sialic acids are {{negatively}} charged and hydrophilic, so they don’t readily cross the hydrophobic regions of cellular membranes. It {{is because of}} this that the uptake of Neu5Gc must occur through an endocytic pathway. More specifically, exogenous Neu5Gc molecules enter cells through clathrin-independent endocytic pathways with help from <b>pinocytosis.</b> After the Neu5Gc has entered the cell via <b>pinocytosis,</b> the molecule is released by lysosomal sialidase. The molecule is then transferred into the cytosol by the lysosomal sialic acid transporter. From here, Neu5Gc are available for activation and addition to glycoconjugates. Because Neu5Gc appears to be enhanced in naturally occurring tumors and fetal tumors, {{it is suggested that}} this uptake mechanism is enhanced by growth factors.|$|E
5000|$|Lacking a mouth, opalines feed {{by taking}} in {{nutrients}} from their surroundings by <b>pinocytosis.</b> While the opalines are {{often referred to}} as [...] "parasites", two lines of evidence suggest that they are actually commensals which do no harm to their anuran hosts.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} films {{were made to}} {{illustrate}} the processes Cohn studied, including Phagocytosis and Degranulation (with Hirsch, 1962) and <b>Pinocytosis</b> and Granule Formation in Macrophages (1967). The Journal of Experimental Medicine later noted that Hirsch and Cohn's “elegant films of live phagocytes...remain an ideal component for many courses in biology.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{general rules}} {{describing}} {{the evolution of}} the structure: endocytosis (moving an elementary membrane inside a neighbouring membrane) and exocytosis (moving an elementary membrane outside the membrane where it is placed). More specific rules are given by <b>pinocytosis</b> (engulfing zero external membranes) and phagocytosis (engulfing just one external elementary membrane).|$|E
50|$|Endocytosis {{is when a}} cell absorbs molecules, such as proteins, {{from outside}} the cell by engulfing it with the cell membrane. It is used by most cells, because many {{critical}} substances are large polar molecules that cannot pass through the cell membrane. The two major types of endocytosis are <b>pinocytosis</b> and phagocytosis.|$|E
50|$|As the {{endpoint}} of endocytosis, the lysosome also {{acts as a}} safeguard {{in preventing}} pathogens {{from being able to}} reach the cytoplasm before being degraded. Pathogens often hijack endocytotic pathways such as <b>pinocytosis</b> in order to gain entry into the cell. The lysosome prevents easy entry into the cell by hydrolyzing the biomolecules of pathogens necessary for their replication strategies; reduced Lysosomal activity results in an increase in viral infectivity, including HIV. In addition, AB5 toxins such as cholera hijack the endosomal pathway while evading lysosomal degradation.|$|E
50|$|APCs usually {{internalise}} exogenous antigens by endocytosis, {{but also}} by <b>pinocytosis,</b> macroautophagy, endosomal microautophagy or chaperone-mediated autophagy. In the first case, after internalisation, the antigens are enclosed in vesicles called endosomes. There are three compartements involved in this antigen presentation pathway: early endosomes, late endosomes or endolysosomes and lysosomes, where antigens are hydrolized by lysosome-associated enzymes (acid-dependent hydrolases, glycosidases, proteases, lipases). This process is favored by gradual reduction of the pH. The main proteases in endosomes are cathepsins {{and the result is}} the degradation of the antigens into oligopeptides.|$|E
50|$|Once {{within a}} muscle or nerve cell, the virus {{undergoes}} replication. The trimeric spikes {{on the exterior}} of the membrane of the virus interact with a specific cell receptor, the most likely one being the acetylcholine receptor. The cellular membrane pinches in a procession known as <b>pinocytosis</b> and allows entry of the virus into the cell by way of an endosome. The virus then uses the acidic environment, which is necessary, of that endosome and binds to its membrane simultaneously, releasing its five proteins and single strand RNA into the cytoplasm.|$|E
50|$|Osmotic nephrosis {{refers to}} {{structural}} {{changes that occur}} at the cellular level in the human kidney. Cells, primarily of the straight proximal tubule, swell due {{to the formation of}} large vacuoles in the cytoplasm. These vacuoles occur in the presence of large amounts of certain solutes circulating in the tubules. However, despite the condition's name, the solutes do not cause change through osmotic forces but through <b>pinocytosis.</b> Once inside the cytoplasm, pinocytic vacuoles combine {{with each other and with}} lysosomes to form large vacuoles that appear transparent under microscopic examination.|$|E
50|$|This {{receptor}} {{also helps}} with {{the recovery of}} IgG in adults {{through the process of}} endocytosis in endothelial cells. FcRn in acidic endosomes bind to IgG internalized through <b>pinocytosis,</b> recycling it to the cell surface and releasing it at the basic pH of blood, and thereby preventing IgG from undergoing lysosomal degradation. This mechanism may provide an explanation for the greater half-life of IgG in the blood compared to that of other antibody isotypes (3 weeks). It has been shown that conjugation of some drugs to the Fc domain of IgG significantly increases their half-life.|$|E
50|$|The mesangium {{is exposed}} to macromolecules from the {{capillary}} lumen as they are separated only by fenestrated endothelium without basement membrane. Mesangial cells {{play a role in}} restricting macromolecules from accumulating in the mesangial space by receptor- independent uptake processes of phagocytosis, micro- and macro-pinocytosis, or receptor-dependent processes and then transported along the mesangial stalk. Size, charge, concentration, and affinity for mesangial cell receptors of the macromolecule affects how the macromolecule is removed. Triglycerides may undergo <b>pinocytosis</b> and antibody IgG complexes may lead to activation of adhesion molecules and chemokines by mesangial cells.|$|E
5000|$|The half-maximum {{stimulation}} {{is attained}} at about 100 nM. Stimulation of phagocytosis was obtained with polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) cells from human, dog, rabbit and cow {{as well as}} with macrophages from lung and peritoneal cavity of mice, and guinea pig and mouse bone marrow cells. This effect is inhibited by peptide analog Thr-Lys-Pro-Pro-Arg [...] The basal activity was not inhibited, so basal phagocytosis may follow a different pathway from that which follows stimulation [...]Stimulation of <b>pinocytosis</b> is exerted only on phagocytic cells, not on cultured cell line mouse leukemia [...]|$|E
5000|$|The binding of a {{specific}} antigen with corresponding BCR molecules results in increased production of the MHC-II molecules. This assumes significance as the same does not happen when the same antigen would be internalized by a relatively nonspecific process called <b>pinocytosis,</b> in which the antigen with the surrounding fluid is [...] "drunk" [...] as a small vesicle by the B cell. Hence, such an antigen {{is known as a}} nonspecific antigen and does not lead to activation of the B cell, or subsequent production of antibodies against it.|$|E
5000|$|... 3. Endocytosis: Endocytosis is {{the process}} in which cells absorb {{molecules}} by engulfing them. The plasma membrane creates a small deformation inward, called an invagination, in which the substance to be transported is captured. The deformation then pinches off from the membrane {{on the inside of}} the cell, creating a vesicle containing the captured substance. Endocytosis is a pathway for internalizing solid particles ("cell eating" [...] or phagocytosis), small molecules and ions ("cell drinking" [...] or <b>pinocytosis),</b> and macromolecules. Endocytosis requires energy and is thus a form of active transport.|$|E
5000|$|Trichoplax adhaerens {{feeds on}} small algae, {{particularly}} on green algae (Chlorophyta) {{of the genus}} Chlorella, cryptomonads (Cryptophyta) of the genera Cryptomonas and Rhodomonas, and blue-green bacteria (Cyanobacteria) such as Phormidium inundatum, but also on detritus from other organisms. In feeding, one or several small pockets form around particles of nutrients on the ventral side, into which digestive enzymes are released by the gland cells; the organisms thus develop a temporary [...] "external stomach", so to speak. The enclosed nutrients are then taken up by <b>pinocytosis</b> ("cell-drinking") by the ciliated cells located on the ventral surface.|$|E
