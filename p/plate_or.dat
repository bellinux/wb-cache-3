5|$|By {{the turn}} of the twentieth century the church had little to show from its earlier history, or indeed of its former wealth, beyond the great size of the church. The church was {{relatively}} plainly decorated – see below – and had nothing by way of old fittings, <b>plate</b> <b>or</b> vestments. Amongst its liturgical plate were a chalice of 1788, an alms plate of 1839, a set of chalice, paten and flagon of 1841, and a silver mounted glass cruet of 1909.|$|E
5|$|Alates are {{collected}} when {{the rainy season}} begins. During a nuptial flight, they are typically seen around lights {{to which they are}} attracted, and so nets are set up on lamps and captured alates are later collected. The wings are removed through a technique that is similar to winnowing. The best result comes when they are lightly roasted on a hot <b>plate</b> <b>or</b> fried until crisp. Oil is not required as their bodies usually contain sufficient amounts of oil. Termites are typically eaten when livestock is lean and tribal crops have not yet developed or produced any food, or if food stocks from a previous growing season are limited.|$|E
5|$|In late Precambrian time, {{extension}} {{from a large}} tectonic <b>plate</b> <b>or</b> smaller plates {{moving away}} from Laurentia thinned its continental crust, forming large rift basins that would ultimately fail to split the continent. Eventually, this sunken region of Laurentia was flooded with a shallow seaway that extended from at least present-day Lake Superior to Glacier National Park in Montana to the Grand Canyon and the Uinta Mountains. The resulting Grand Canyon Supergroup of sedimentary units is composed of nine varied geologic formations that were laid down from 1.2billion and 740million years ago in this sea. Good exposures of the supergroup {{can be seen in}} eastern Grand Canyon in the Inner Gorge and from Desert View, Lipan Point and Moran point.|$|E

5|$|The Pichilemu {{earthquake}} {{was caused}} by the change in regional stress from the 27February earthquake. Preliminary analyses by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) of the 11March earthquake locations and seismic-wave radiation patterns suggested that the event resulted from normal faulting within the subducting Nazca <b>plate</b> <b>or</b> the overriding South America plate, unlike the 27 February earthquake, which occurred as thrust faulting on the interface between the two plates. Later in 2010, University of Chile Seismologist Sergio Barrientos stated that the earthquake was produced inside the South American plate. While news media reported the earthquake as an aftershock of the February earthquake in Chile, a preliminary geological summary issued by the USGS considered it to be an independent earthquake, a conclusion which seismologist Jaime Campos of the University of Chile also reached.|$|E

50|$|Inclined flat <b>plates</b> <b>or</b> tubes can {{be added}} to {{traditional}} sedimentation basins to improve particle removal performance.

25|$|Some ammonites {{have been}} found in {{association}} with a single horny <b>plate</b> <b>or</b> a pair of calcitic plates. In the past, these plates were assumed to serve in closing the opening of the shell {{in much the same way}} as an operculum, but more recently, they are postulated to have been, instead, a jaw apparatus.|$|E
25|$|The {{ammunition}} <b>plate</b> <b>or</b> block had to {{be removed}} by hand before another loaded plate could be inserted. Unlike in the Gatling gun and later rapid-firing automatic weapons, the entire loading and firing process was manual. The mitrailleuse's major innovation was that it greatly increased the speed of these processes when compared to standard infantry rifles of the era.|$|E

50|$|In the {{presence}} of a moderately strong magnetic field, unmagnetized magnets of this series will try to align their orientation axis to the magnetic field, thus becoming slightly magnetized. This can be an issue if postprocessing requires that the magnet be <b>plated</b> <b>or</b> coated. The slight field that the magnet picks up can attract debris during the <b>plating</b> <b>or</b> coating process, causing coating failure or a mechanically out-of-tolerance condition.|$|R
