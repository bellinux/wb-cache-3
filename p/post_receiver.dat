50|$|After {{two years}} with the 49ers, Holovak {{remained}} in the Bay Area by accepting the <b>post</b> of <b>receivers</b> coach with the Raiders on March 6, 1971. When the team failed to reach the postseason {{for the first time}} in five years, Holovak was let go, but signed as a scout with the New York Jets on July 10, 1972. Returning to sidelines the next year as running backs coach, he then moved into the Jets' front office following the 1974 NFL season as Director of Player Personnel.|$|R
50|$|The Receiver was {{appointed}} by the Crown. All {{the property of the}} Metropolitan Police was technically owned by the holder of the <b>post</b> of <b>Receiver,</b> who had the legal status of a corporation sole. All contracts were made in his name and all purchases, sales and contracts required his approval. He had equal status with the Commissioners. This had the advantage that the police, holding no property themselves, were protected from accusations of corruption. In 1839, the Receiver also became responsible for the administration of the police courts.|$|R
25|$|According {{to his own}} account, he {{continued}} his education at Durham, learning the trivium and quadrivium, with Virgil, Plato and Plotinus among his favourite authors. If Lawrence's own testimony is to be believed, he was held in high acclaim in his early years for his poetry and fine singing. In Lawrence's time as a teacher, he may have taught Ailred, later abbot of Rievaulx. Lawrence took up {{a place in the}} bishop's court during the episcopate of Geoffrey Rufus (1133–1141). Probably an episcopal chaplain, Lawrence was cantor and may have held the <b>post</b> of <b>receiver</b> general in Bishop Geoffrey's exchequer.|$|R

50|$|When Arthur entered Parliament for {{the family}} borough of Guildford in 1720, he gave up to Richard the <b>post</b> of <b>receiver</b> general of the Post Office, which was not {{compatible}} with a Parliamentary seat and paid almost £400 per year. Richard exchanged into the 30th Regiment of Foot in 1719 and the 15th Regiment of Foot in 1721. During the 1722 election at Haslemere, where the Onslows had an interest, Richard became involved in a brawl with James Oglethorpe. Oglethorpe and his fellow Tory candidate Peter Burrell came upon Onslow and his companion, a Mr. Sharp. Burrell complained of Sharp's insulting electioneering practices, and Oglethorpe struck Sharp with his cane; when Onslow attempted to interpose, Oglethorpe drew on him. Onslow was injured in the thigh, but disarmed Oglethorpe; he was wounded again in the left hand when Oglethorpe attempted to recover his sword, but by now his temper had cooled, and he helped bind Onslow's wounds and summoned a surgeon for him. Onslow was promoted to captain lieutenant (and lieutenant-colonel in the Army) in the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards on 7 July 1724.|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} a song transmission experiment {{to investigate the}} effects of distance, song <b>post</b> height, <b>receiver</b> perch height, signaller sex, and microhabitat on song degradation in rufous-and-white wrens (Thryothorus rufalbus), a neotropical duetting songbird. We quantified {{the effects of these}} factors on excess attenuation, signal-to-noise ratio, tail-to-signal ratio, and blur ratio of male and female songs. As expected, song degradation increased with distance between signaller and receiver. Songs transmitted best when emitted from moderate heights (5 - 7 m), although this pattern varied with receiver distance, receiver height and microhabitat. The patterns regarding receiver height were subtle and inconsistent, but receivers may maximise their ability to hear male and female songs when perched at a height of 7 m and 5 m, respectively. Female songs were generally more degraded than male songs. Rufous-and-white wren songs appeared more attenuated in open field than forest habitats, but microhabitat conditions within the forests exerted a strong influence on song degradation. These findings match previous studies showing an effect of distance, song post height, and habitat, but contrast with other research by showing a minimal effect of receiver perch height. This study represents the first detailed investigation of differences in song transmission between males and females. © 2009 BRILL...|$|R

40|$|Network {{conditions}} in a mobile environment are often difficult {{from the point}} of view of traditional network protocols, such as TCP. Intermittent connectivity, long delays and nonexistent end-to-end paths hinder protocol performance or may prevent it altogether. A delay-tolerant network (DTN) is an overlay network that tackles these problems and allows communication to flow even in severe conditions. In this special assignment, we will devise an architecture for DTN-based blogging and also implement it in a concrete application. Traditional blogs require that a TCP connection from the user to the blog server exists. Our application allows a mobile user to send posts to her blog without a preexisting end-to-end communication path. The underlying DTN takes care of delivering the <b>post</b> to the <b>receiver,</b> on an opportunistic hop-by-hop basis if needed. The user interfaces to the application—both for composing the posts and for reading them—are regular HTML pages, accessible with any web browser. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{first chapter}} studies optimal {{information}} revelation with one-sided asymmetric information. A sender chooses ex ante how her {{information will be}} revealed ex <b>post.</b> A <b>receiver</b> obtains both public information and information revealed by the sender, and then takes one of two actions. The sender wishes to maximize {{the probability that the}} receiver takes the desired action. The sender optimally reveals only whether the receiver's utility is above a cutoff. The cutoff is such that the receiver is indifferent between the two actions when he learns that his utility is above the cutoff. The sender's welfare increases and the receiver's welfare does not change with the precision of the sender's information. The sender's welfare decreases and the receiver's welfare increases with the precision of public information. The second chapter studies optimal information revelation with two-sided asymmetric information. A sender chooses ex ante how her information will be revealed ex post with the goal of persuading an informed receiver to take one of two actions. The sender faces a tradeoff between the frequency and the persuasiveness of messages: sending positive messages more often (in terms of the sender's private information) makes it less likely that the receiver will take the desired action (in terms of the receiver's private information). Under the optimal mechanism, the sender's and receiver's welfare is not monotone in the precision of the receiver's private information. I provide necessary and sufficient conditions when the full information revelation is optimal and when the no information revelation is optimal. The third chapter (co-authored with Li Hao and Wei Li) studies a principal-agent problem where the only commitment for the uninformed principal is to restrict the set of decisions she makes following a report by the informed agent. Compared to no commitment, the principal improves the quality of communication from the agent. An ex ante optimal equilibrium for the principal corresponds to a finite partition of the state space, and each retained decision is suboptimal for the principal, biased toward the agent's preference. Generally an optimal equilibrium does not maximize the number of decisions the principal can credibly retain. by Anton Kolotilin. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|As modern fishery {{assessments}} {{change in}} an effort to be more accurate and encompass the range of potential ecosystem interactions, critical information on the ecology of species including life history, intra and inter-specific competitive interactions and habitat requirements must be added to the standard fishery-dependent and independent data sets. One species whose movements and habitat associations greatly affects exploitation patterns is lingcod, Ophiodon elongatus, which support an economically important fishery along the coastal waters of the Pacific Coast of North America. High site fidelity and limited movements within nearshore areas are hypothesized to have resulted in high catchability, a major factor that has contributed to overfished stocks. Thus, assessing the level of movement and connectivity among lingcod subpopulations inhabiting nearshore habitats is a prerequisite to determining the condition of lingcod stocks. We used the Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking (<b>POST)</b> Project acoustic <b>receiver</b> array in Alaska’s Prince William Sound to monitor movements and residency of 21 acoustic-tagged lingcod for up to 16 months. Eight of sixteen lingcod (50 %) initially aged at 2. 5 - to 3. 5 years-old dispersed from their tag site. Dispersal was highly seasonal, occurring in two, five-week periods from mid-December through January and from mid-April through May. Dispersal in winter may be related to sexually immature lingcod or newly-mature male lingcod being displaced by territorial males. Spring dispersal may be indicative of the onset of migratory behavior where lingcod move out into Prince William Sound and possibly the offshore waters of the Gulf o...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 34) In {{this project}} a Software Defined Radio <b>receiver</b> <b>post</b> processing module {{has been designed}} and simulated in the Universal Serial Radio Peripheral (USRP) using Mathworks Simulink software; it was then translated into Hardware Description Language (HDL) and synthesized using the HDL Workflow Advisor in Simulink {{in order to be}} written {{as a part of the}} FPGA firmware inside the USRP N 210. The design was created to shift and filter an incoming signal in real time using modules from the HDL Coder Simulink library. HDL synthesis results suffered from timing failures that could be prevented if the Simulink block HDL code was properly registered. A basic complex multiplier block available in Simulink could not pass the design???s timing requirements and had to be constructed from multiplication and addition blocks with every operation explicitly registered by the delay blocks. The majority of the rounding methods failed timing when used to configure the multiplication and filter blocks, and floor/zero rounding methods resulted in a DC component present at the circuit output. In order to correct the DC issue one can output complete results and use the data type conversion Simulink blocks to round off the result to an acceptable data width, while registering every operation with a delay block. The ability to move Simulink signal processing modules inside the FPGAs is important because it allows the performance of traditional post processing computations to be performed in real time inside the FPGAs thus taking advantage of the parallel processing capabilities available in the FPGAs and high-level communication system design methods offered by Simulink...|$|R
30|$|Growing {{use of the}} Internet as a major {{means of}} {{communication}} {{has led to the}} formation of cyber-communities, which have become increasingly appealing to terrorist groups due to the unregulated nature of Internet communication. Online communities enable violent extremists to increase recruitment by allowing them to build personal relationships with a worldwide audience capable of accessing uncensored content. This article presents methods for identifying the recruitment activities of violent groups within extremist social media websites. Specifically, these methods apply known techniques within supervised learning and natural language processing to the untested task of automatically identifying forum posts intended to recruit new violent extremist members. We used data from the western jihadist website Ansar AlJihad Network, which was compiled by the University of Arizona’s Dark Web Project. Multiple judges manually annotated a sample of these data, marking 192 randomly sampled posts as recruiting (Yes) or non-recruiting (No). We observed significant agreement between the judges’ labels; Cohen’s κ=(0.5, 0.9) at p= 0.01. We tested the feasibility of using naive Bayes models, logistic regression, classification trees, boosting, and support vector machines (SVM) to classify the forum <b>posts.</b> Evaluation with <b>receiver</b> operating characteristic (ROC) curves shows that our SVM classifier achieves an 89 % area under the curve (AUC), a significant improvement over the 63 % AUC performance achieved by our simplest naive Bayes model (Tukey’s test at p= 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first result reported on this task, and our analysis indicates that automatic detection of online terrorist recruitment is a feasible task. We also identify a number of important areas of future work including classifying non-English posts and measuring how recruitment posts and current events change membership numbers over time.|$|R
