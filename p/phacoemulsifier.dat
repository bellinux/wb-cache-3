40|$|International audienceFive {{consecutive}} {{cases of}} endophthalmitis that developed after cataract extraction {{by a single}} surgeon using the same operating room during one morning session are described. Following preoperative topical administration of ciprofloxacin, surgery consisted of phacoemulsification with peristaltic pump and fluid venting, polymethylmethacrylate intraocular lens implantation, and corneal suture. No complications occurred during surgery. All five patients developed endophthalmitis caused by infection with Alcaligenes xylosoxidans in less than 24 hours. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to prove similarity between strains. Bacterial inquiry on contamination of the operating room environment revealed massive colonization of <b>phacoemulsifier</b> irrigation channels by Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria from an unestablished source. Four of the five patients ultimately recovered visual acuity better than 20 / 60...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To compare {{different}} methods for surgical treatment of cataract {{in patients with}} diabetes melli-tus (DM) and substantiate the choice of its optimal modality. Materials and methods. Analysis included data on 209 patients (221 eyes) treated from January 2008 to December 2009 in the Department of Retinopathy and Ophthalmosurgey, Endocrinological Research Centre. Diabetic cataract was managed using UNIVERSAL-II, LEGACY EVEREST, and INFINITI <b>phacoemulsifiers.</b> Parameters studied included time of ultrasound (US) ex-posure, US power, and retinal characteristics in the early postoperative period. In addition, analysis included data on the location of lens opacity in 1047 patients (1897 eyes) with diabetic cataract. Results. Relatively low corrected and uncorrected visual acuity in the early postoperative period was attributable to concomitant DM-related retinal pathology. Analysis of lenticular opacity showed that {{it in the first}} place affected collagen fibers beneath the posterior capsule. The use of torsional US in INFINITI for cataract phacoemulsification produced almost 4 -fold reduction in the exposure time of ocular tissues. As a result, the postoperative oedema was significantly smaller than in patients undergoing combined treatment (AQUALASE hydromonitoring and OZIL ultrasound system). Conclusion. Combination of ultrasound and hydromonitoring phacoemulsification for the treatment of cataract in DM patients reduces exposure time of ocular tissues and postoperative oedema which creates prerequisites for faster recovery of visual acuity after surgery. Functional results of surgical treatment of diabetic cataract can be further improved by early diagnosis of lens opacity and the use of US and hydromonitoring phacoemulsification techniques...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Corneal and scleral burns, one of {{the main}} {{complications}} that can occur during a cataract operation, are produced by overheating due {{to the use of the}} <b>phacoemulsifier.</b> The temperature of the anterior chamber of the eye can be measured both invasively using thermocouples and non-invasively, but only superficially, using a thermocamera. Methods: To compare the measures obtained from both techniques an in vitro experimental analysis was conducted on pigs' eyes. During a simulated phacoemulsification cataract operation both the surface temperature with a thermocamera and the temperature inside the anterior chamber with a thermocouple were recorded. For each procedure, the maximum temperature values measured by each technique were compared. Results: The results of this research show that the difference between the maximum values measured with the two techniques is on average 0. 5 degrees C. Conclusions: It is possible to employ a thermocamera technique instead of a thermocouple technique to provide an indication of the temperature inside the anterior chamber.

30|$|Before {{disconnecting}} {{the hand}} piece from {{the unit of}} phacoemulsification machine, the hand piece’s ports, tips, and tubing should be flushed. By flushing the hand piece, we can prevent build-up of material (which is difficult to remove) by cleaning inside the hand piece, thus preventing its occlusion. If the tips of hand pieces become occluded, several centers consider that a potential cause of toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS) (Swaddiwudhipong et al. 1995). Many bacterial species including Pseudomonas species {{have the ability to}} form biofilms in different environments as a defense against predation. A biofilm comprises microorganisms multicellular communities in which cells stick to each other and also to a surface. These cells are embedded in an extracellular slimy matrix. The biofilm bacteria are sheltered from harmful factors in the environment, such as antibiotics, and a host body’s immune system. Biofilms may form on living or non-living surfaces, such as implants and tubing. Biofilm formation is an obstacle concerning the uses and design of ocular devices, such as contact lenses, conjunctival plugs, intraocular lenses, scleral buckles, lacrimal intubation devices, <b>phacoemulsifier</b> internal tubing, and orbital implants (Bispo et al. 2015).|$|E
40|$|Purpose : To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} topical anesthesia; topical Benoxinate 0. 4 % (Oxybuprocaine) and Xylocaine (Lidocaine) gel, in selected cataract patients {{as an alternative to}} peribulbar or retrobulbar block anesthesia during cataract surgery. Materials and Methods : Prospective non-comparative evaluation of patients′ and surgeon′s satisfaction {{at the end of the}} procedure. Three hundred patients (300 eyes) were included in the study. The procedure was explained to patients with details regarding what will happen and what to expect during surgery. All patients received topical anesthesia with Benoxinate 0. 4 % eye drops and Xylocaine gel 2 %. All surgeries were done by the same surgeon using the same machine (updated LEGACY <b>phacoemulsifier,</b> Alcon) and approach (clear corneal incision) and followed by a foldable intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Results : None of the patients had severe pain during the procedure; only 2 % (six of 300) required use of intravenous sedation (Propofol), both the surgeon′s and the patients′ satisfaction were high. Eye movements and blepharospasm were not significant problems, and no serious complications occurred. Rate of vitreous loss due to posterior capsule tear/rupture was within literature reported range and not different from our previous experience. Conclusion : Topical anesthesia is a satisfactory and safe alternative to retrobulbar and peribulbar anesthesia for clear corneal phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation in selected cataract patients in the hands of experienced cataract surgeon...|$|E
30|$|Postoperative endophthalmitis is {{a serious}} {{complication}} of cataract and intraocular lens implantation surgery; the incidence ranges from 0.07 to 0.12 % (Kresloff et al. 1998). Many previous studies had reported outbreaks of post cataract surgery endophthalmitis caused by P. aeruginosa (Guerra et al. 2012; Pathengay et al. 2012; Hoffmann et al. 2002; Mateos et al. 2006; Pinna et al. 2010; Sunenshine et al. 2009 a; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 1992; Sunenshine et al. 2009 b; Ramappa et al. 2015; Kenchappa et al. 2009; Arsan et al. 1996). One of the Pseudomonas endophthalmitis outbreaks compromised large numbers of cases of 45 patients with 45 affected eyes in 2 -day period (Guerra et al. 2012).This study included six eyes of six patients (six cultures positive for Pseudomonas) in 1 -day period. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a saprophytic Gram-negative bacterium that is widely distributed in water, soil, and plants. P. aeruginosa is an important opportunistic pathogen in health care-associated infections (HAI) (Hoffmann et al. 2002). The P. aeruginosa epidemics seem {{to be related to}} contaminated intraocular irrigating solutions (Guerra et al. 2012; Mateos et al. 2006), lens solution (Ramappa et al. 2015), and trypan blue dye (Mateos et al. 2006; Sunenshine et al. 2009 a), in povidone-iodine solution (Pinna et al. 2010), at the <b>phacoemulsifier</b> fluid circulation (Pathengay et al. 2012; Hoffmann et al. 2002; Pinna et al. 2010; Eifrig et al. 2003; Cruciani et al. 1998; Zaluski et al. 1999) and air-conditioning units (Boks et al. 2006). In this study, we could not identify the exact source of the outbreak as all the screened environmental samples gave negative results. However, the reused reprocessed cassette of the phaco-machine was used in common for all cases of phacoemulsification performed that day in operative room OT 4. The cassette was disposed of in the infectious bag before the next day of operative surgery; no sample could be obtained for pathogen isolation.|$|E
