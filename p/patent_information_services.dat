40|$|<b>Patent</b> <b>information</b> centres in Europe (PATLIB) have to reorganise their {{business}} model {{because of the}} changing market situation for <b>information</b> <b>services</b> in Europe. It is shown, that the present approach only covers a small segment of the <b>information</b> <b>service</b> market and results in low accessible market volumes for PATLIB centres. Furthermore free-of-charge web-based <b>patent</b> <b>information</b> tends to result in difficulties to achieve cost covering prices for PATLIB services. The future PATLIB market situation can be summarised as expecting danger of reduced economic viability. Based on the specific PATLIB centre characteristics a redesign of business model is described. To generate a profitable future perspective {{it is necessary to}} focus on customer relationship marketing (CRM) for the main customer, respectively the business potential of small and medium enterprise (SME) environment. Six steps are proposed for the reorganisation into IP service centres. The first two steps are the orientation along the SME-customers IP value chain and a process oriented marketing approach. The next two steps are basic business models to meet the new process orientation. Finally the necessity and the arrangement of a tight European service network to offer top quality customer services and redesigned marketing activities is described. <b>Patent</b> <b>information</b> <b>service</b> PATLIB Intellectual property service centre CRM Customer relationship marketing SME Business model redesign Profitability...|$|R

40|$|Forty years ago, a few librarians started {{collecting}} foreign patent documents, {{opening a}} new service to visitors. China's first Patent Library was organized 10 {{years later in}} 1965.

It also questions the costs and royalties demanded by some offices for the use of their raw data for processing by commercial services, and the policy of producing products such as CD-ROMs at extremely low prices, undermining the viability of commercial services. ...|$|R

The initial success of the system in the early 1980 s was so great that its rapidly increasing cost forced some curtailment of its expansion. In 1987 a pilot project was undertaken to determine whether CD-ROM supplied to the PDLs could substitute for some parts of the on-line service. This has proved successful in reducing the cost of the on-line service and further expansion of CD-ROM use to all PDLs is planned in 1989. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} <b>patent</b> <b>information</b> by innovative SMEs. The standard literature tends to focus on obtaining patents; studies of using <b>patent</b> <b>information</b> for different purposes are underrepresented in the innovation literature. Studying the case of SMEs is especially interesting, because they often do not have in-house specialists dealing with patent issues. Our research reveals {{that the most important}} reasons why SMEs do not use <b>patent</b> <b>information</b> are: (i) costs; (ii) unclear procedures. These constraints may be tackled by improving the communication on the usefulness of <b>patent</b> <b>information,</b> improving access to <b>patent</b> <b>information,</b> and integrating more lessons on using <b>patent</b> and <b>patent</b> <b>information</b> in education. Given that using <b>patent</b> <b>information</b> is useful for SMEs, its use should be promoted.

40|$|Patent {{information}} {{is useful to}} {{a wide spectrum of}} users. Chemical patent {{information is}} particularly useful to those concerned with innovations in this area, as the chemical patent literature is almost of {{the same size as the}} chemical journal literature. National and International patent laws and treaties greatly influence the size of patent literature, its dissemination and exploitation for economic development. Paris Convention, WIPO and PCT programmes have all played an important role in the field of patent information. In India, patent information has a very significant role to play because the country's present law offers wide-ranging opportunities from adaptive development on a foreign patent to its commercialization. <b>Patent</b> <b>information</b> <b>services</b> in India are provided by several organisations which include the Patent Office Headquarters at Calcutta and its branches at New Delhi, Bombay and Madras; Patent Information System, Nagpur; National Informatics Centre, New Delhi; Patent Unit, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi; Technical Information Cell, Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, Hyderabad; National Chemical Laboratory, Pune and National Information Centre for Drugs and Pharmaceuticals, Lucknow. Many of these organisations cover all areas of technology whereas others are restricted to particular disciplines. National Information Centre for Drugs and Pharmaceuticals is one such specialised centre restricted to only drugs and pharmaceutical. Its services such as patent bulletin and patent searches on selected drugs have been well accepted by the users. The Centre's holdings of foreign patent literature are meagre and need to be strengthened by acquiring them mainly from the U. S. A., France, F. R. G., Japan, Italy and Switzerland which are the top six nations responsible for introducing new drug substances. With a computer now installed at the Centre, the Centre should acquire INPADOC database and collaborate with existing Patent Information System, Nagpur and National Informatics Centre, New Delhi for better services. A survey of the <b>patent</b> <b>information</b> <b>services</b> in the countries of Asia and the Pacific carried out by the International Bureau of WIPO has put India in the first category because here information services are rendered by both the Industrial property organisation and other outside agencies. ...|$|E

Systems of this type will be able to deliver promptly and comprehensively to either an intermediary or a final user all kinds of messages or notices on every incoming relevant document.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{regional}} economic structure of Luxembourg reveals that some companies are keeping pace with information and communication technologies.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{key issues}} relating to the performance and challenges of publicly funded <b>patent</b> <b>information</b> <b>services</b> in the EU- 27. The results are {{to a large extent}} rooted in a wider benchmarking analysis carried out on behalf of the European Commission as part of its 'PRO INNO Europe activities' the aim of which was to identify and benchmark all available IP-related support services in Europe and a number of overseas countries. For this paper, the relevant findings of the benchmarking study have been amended with an additional literature review and with an outline of the tool of semantic patent analysis. It is found that the competence of the operating staff, easy identification/visibility and timely delivery are among the most significant quality aspects {{from the point of view}} of the SMEs, while the geographical proximity of the SMEs to the service premises is a factor of less importance. Information needs of SMEs extend well beyond technical information on patents, and include interpretative help for search results but also IP management questions for decisions on why to use particular IP protection instruments in specific circumstances. The method of semantic patent analysis is described as one possible future option to extend the service activities of relevant information centres. However, provisions must be made in the governance of the (new and/or extended) services, and the reasoning for the need of the offerings should point to clear cases of market failure in order to avoid conflict with the private service sector.
