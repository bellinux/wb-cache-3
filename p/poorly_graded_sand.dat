The {{exposures}} of the Marshalltown Formation at Ellisdale have basal lenticular bedded estuarine clays underlain by crossbedded coastal sands of the Englishtown Formation. The estuarine clays are overlain by well-sorted, crossbedded sand and offshore glauconites, respectively. The entire sequence is interpreted as preserving the landward migration of a barrier beach/backbay/estuarine/deltaic complex during the Marshalltown transgression. Vertebrate fossils are concentrated with rip-up clasts near {{the base of the}} estuarine clay sequence in a lag deposit consisting of siderite pebbles, <b>poorly</b> <b>graded</b> <b>sand,</b> and lignite. The fossil layer is considered a single-event storm deposit based on sedimentology and stratigraphy. The upper (marine) member of the Marshalltown was formerly considered latest Campanian in age, due to the presence of the foraminifer Globotruncana calcarata; however the G. calcarata zone has since been redated as Middle Campanian in age (75-76 ma). A recent study of fossil pollen from the estuarine strata enclosing the fossil layer has determined an Early to Mid-Campanian age for the stratum (76 - 80 ma) and a fresh or brackish water tidal marsh environment of deposition.|$|E

The pipes prove to be extremely shallow and the pipe depth close to the pipe tip is just large enough to let a particle through. As the pipe grows, the pipe depth increases due to scour and reallocation of grains, allowing for a higher flow rate and more grains to pass. Furthermore, the pipe often consists of a shallow part in the middle and deeper parts at the outside...|$|R

The sand samples used include Okhoro, Ikpoba, Ovia and Okhuahiaerosion sands and Ikpoba, Ovia and Okhuahia river sands. Particle size distribution of the sands was first determined and the result was used to design grades 20, 25, and 30 concretes to Department of Environment (DOE) mix design method. Twelve cubes were cast from one particular sand sample and three cubes were tested at 7, 14 and 28 days for each grade of concrete respectively.

The effects of seepage water elevation in embankments, toe drain, embankment height, base slope inclination, soil compaction, and fill materials on the seismic behaviour of embankments were investigated. The test results showed that: (1) the seepage water {{was one of the}} most important factors for earthquake-induced embankment failure; (2) the seismic performance of both the smaller and higher embankments was remarkably improved by installing the toe drain; (3) larger base slope inclination produced larger earthquake-induced deformation of embankments; (4) well-compacted embankments were not vulnerable to earthquake-induced damage; and (5) the seismic performance of well-compacted embankments consisting of well-graded silty soils with large fines content was higher than that of <b>poorly</b> <b>graded</b> <b>sands</b> under otherwise the same condition. In some tests, as observed during past strong earthquakes, delayed flow failure occurred due possibly to the multiple effects of upward seepage associated with the redistribution of excess pore water pressures generated during main shaking, continued small vibration after main shaking, and driving static shear stresses caused by the embankment weight. A series of triaxial compression and cyclic triaxial liquefaction tests was also conducted to evaluate undrained behaviour of the fill materials.

40|$|A major level {{drawdown}} {{of about}} 20 m, due to low inflows and reservoir operation, was experienced {{at the time}} interval between the hydrographic survey of the Kremasta reservoir (July 1999) and the collection of two sedimentary cores from the reservoir's invert (September 2001). The minimum reservoir level was recorded in December 2000. The sedimentary cores were taken at the Acheloos River mouth within a meandering reservoir section of about 2. 3 km distance from each other. At the latter time, a significant channel change was observed at the upstream core cross section with respect to its configuration in July 1999. At the maximum level drawdown, this cross section was actually upstream of the reservoir and {{the surface of the}} deposited sediment was exposed while the downstream one was only marginally submerged. This change of the channel profile is attributed to a significant erosion of loose, fine grained, deposited sediment during the first winter intense floods {{around the time of the}} reservoirSs minimum level. The channel geometry changed completely and the vertical scour of the deposited sediments was at least 2 m. The eroded sediment was transported downstream to the reservoir's interior and re-deposited according to flow velocity regime. The downstream core is investigated for possible signs of deposition of the eroded sediment. Apart from the analysis of the recent reservoir drawdown, cores were also described and correlated using lithology and sedimentary structures. The sediment deposits are composed of <b>poorly</b> <b>graded</b> <b>sands</b> to low plasticity clays and the horizontal stratification implies major flood events, possibly associated with the historical drawdowns of the reservoir (e. g. silty sand on top of low plasticity clay). The above observations illustrate the dynamic behaviour of the reservoir siltation as a result of reservoir operation, intense flood events and incoming sediment load. The analyses of the sedimentary cores' lithological sections, can serve as a useful tool for reconstructing the siltation history of the Kremasta reservoir...|$|R

The experimental programme {{is part of}} the EU-funded NECER project (Network of European Centrifuges for Environmental Geotechnic Research), whose objective is to investigate the appropriateness of geotechnical centrifuge modelling for the investigation of geoenvironmental problems, particularly with reference to partially saturated soils. The tests were performed at the geotechnical centrifuge laboratories of Cardiff. Bochum. Manchester, and LCPC in Nantes. The aim was to determine the scaling laws of capillary rise under both equilibrium and transient conditions. In all laboratories, column wetting tests in fine <b>poorly</b> <b>graded</b> <b>sands</b> (Congleton Sand, Bochum Normsand, HPF 5 Sand, and Fontaineblau Sand) were performed. Capillary rise above the phreatic surface of the sand model was distinguished in a continuous capillary zone (completely saturated) and a discontinuous capillary zone (partially saturated). The Cardiff Geotechnical Centrifuge Laboratory used matrix potential probes to follow the capillary rise of the continuous zone and, therefore, determine the suction above the phreatic zone during centrifuge testing. Ar Bochum, two cameras were used for optical and volumetric measurements, in order to follow the rise of the visible wetting front (upper limit of discontinuous zone) in the sand within the sample column. At Manchester. the movement of the wetting front was observed by video cameras over periods up to 8 h, whereas in LCPC pore pressure transducers recorded the changes in pressure caused by capillarity. A simple centrifuge similitude law for capillary rise in these sands has been established and the kinetic phenomena have been measured {{as a function of the}} gravitational field. The results from these experiments verify that both the continuous and discontinuous capillary zones are scaled at a factor 1 /N whereas the time for rise seems to be scaled at a factor 1 /N- 2. This research suggests that capillary phenomena can be modelled using a geotechnical centrifuge. Therefore, centrifuge testing can be a useful tool for future modelling of boundary value problems involving complex transport phenomena. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of geological and morphological features to the geotechnical characteristics of coarse grain soils can lead via statistical methods to determinie correlations between strength and its physical properties. The shape and sizes of sand particles reflect the formation {{history of the}} grains where it results from the dis{{integration of}} rocks due to water, weather and glaciers. The particle interactions of sand due to shear deformation and also seismic reactions of different shape and sizes would result in various sedimentological macroscale behaviour. Clean sands are cohesionless (c = 0) but have a finite friction angle (Ø) and its shear strength is entirely dependent on the density, normal stress and interlocking particle structure.

High normal stresses give very little variations in the angle of dilatancy (ψ) between the samples tested as compared to the lower normal stress that was used.

Single element simulation of the triaxial tests was performed to validate the proposed constitutive model. The adopted model allowed non-linear elastic behaviour prior to yielding. After yielding of the sand, the state parameter-based model for the sand permitted non-associated plastic flow. Dilation and frictional strength were both dependent on the current value of the state parameter. The combination of laboratory testing and single element modelling resulted in the selection of a single set of material constants for the soil, which adequately described the full range of triaxial tests.

Because of this, washboarding, protruding rocks, rutting and potholes are common performance problems of many northern gravel roads. Routine blading of these roads is often ineffective because unstable sand does not maintain its shape and compaction, protruding bedrock and boulders damage motor grader blades, boulders may become dislodged leaving holes in the road, and dislodged boulders are a safety hazard when windrowed along road side-slopes.

To achieve the goal, content of plant available potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) were quantified in soil profiles at an interval of 100 m from top to bottom of the mountains. Loss on ignition, pH, particle size and soil types were also examined and described. Organic carbon (C) were determined by loss on ignition. The plant available nutrients were determined by extracting soil with AL-solution (0. 1 M ammonium lactate and 0. 4 M acetate). Soil pH of all samples were determined in a soil: water of 1 : 2. 5 (volume based) with the help of pH meter. Dry sieving was performed to determine the particle size distribution (texture) of the soil. Unified soil classification technique was used to determine the soil type on the basis of uniformity coefficient and coefficient of curvature. Overall, plant available nutrients K, Mg, Ca, organic C is found to be significantly unchanged with respect to the mountain, but, phosphate is significantly different. Soil type is not variate with altitude and slope. Particle sizes D 10, D 60 were found to be almost same in all profiles, but D 30 Varies significantly. Also, pH is not changed too with respect to the mountain, horizon and soil type. Soils were found acidic in all profiles. Organic C, K, Ca and Mg show negative correlations with pH and altitude. In contrast, phosphate is positive correlated with pH and altitude. Organic C is found to be skewed with respect to the mountains and depths. Its concentration is higher in sand than gravel, and it is declining downward as well. Average potassium contents were high in upper soil and <b>poorly</b> <b>graded</b> <b>sand,</b> and the average estimated content were 10 mg/ 100 g. Average Phosphate content was 1 - 2 mg/ 100 g in north face, and it was 0. 5 - 1 mg/ 100 g in south face. The content was higher in gravel than sand. Magnesium content was between 1. 4 and 57. 1 mg/ 100 gm, it was high in well graded sand, and not normally distributed. Ca varied between 10. 4 and 279. 6 mg/ 100 g and it was reducing with depth.

In Hong Kong, the construction industry has used reinforcement with continuous fibres for some time, but it is mainly applied to landscaping of otherwise stabilised slopes, for example as a green cover on an existing shotcreted slope. Using randomly distributed short discrete fibres in Hong Kong completely decomposed granite (CDG) could help stabilise the soil while keeping the density low enough to allow growth of vegetation. It is not guaranteed, however, that a well graded residual soil like CDG would behave {{in the same way as}} sands used by previous researchers. Laboratory tests have been carried out on completely decomposed granite using short discrete polypropylene fibres as a reinforcing material. The fibres are randomly distributed in the soil. It was found that the fibres increase the unconfined compressive strength of the CDG prepared at its maximum dry density by up to tenfold for fibre contents less than 1 %. The behaviour of the fibre-CDG mixture during drained triaxial compression changed from dilative to compressive, with more effects at low confining pressures. These tests seem to indicate that discrete fibres could be considered for improving the performance of CDG. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|According to a 2012 American Coal Ash Association Coal {{production}} Survey Report, US {{coal fired}} power plants {{produced more than}} 109 million tons of waste that year. Approximately half of this waste is the valuable by-product fly ash. There are three classes of fly ash: cementitious class C and non-cementitious classes F and N. Over half of the fly ash produced {{is used in the}} geotechnical/construction industries. Most geotechnical soil stabilization studies using fly ash are focused on controlling shrink-swell potential of clays. This study utilized the less desirable class F fly ash to assess the improvement of shear strength parameters of granular soils. Two mix designs were developed and tested using consolidated undrained, unconfined compression, and triaxial testing. Mix designs consisted of 15 % fly ash with 0. 5 or 1 % cement, and <b>poorly</b> <b>graded</b> Ottawa <b>sand</b> compacted using a standard effort at 10 percent moisture content. Consolidated undrained testing on Mix 1, which included flushing and saturating the specimens, produced higher shear strength parameters than for the sand alone. However, the results were inconsistent with respect to the increase in shear strength parameters with time. Unconfined compression testing was then conducted on both Mix 1 and Mix 2 to assess strength gain with time. Results showed both mixes gained appreciable strength with time but doubling the cement did not double the unconfined compressive strength. Triaxial testing was then conducted on Mix 1 using specimens that were not flushed or saturated. This testing was used to determine if flushing destroyed the specimen soil fabric. The shear strength parameters from the triaxial testing were very similar to those determined from consolidated undrained testing. This demonstrated that flushing did not affect the shear strength parameters. Inconsistent triaxial test results from fly ash-cement-sand mixes have been previously reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|In Australia, {{thousands}} of tonnes of biosolids are produced annually {{and millions of}} dollars expended on their management. Biosolids are derived from wastewater sludge, which is the major solid component collected from the wastewater treatment process. This paper presents some of the results from a study concerning the use of biosolids in fired-clay bricks. The geotechnical characteristics of three biosolids samples from the stockpiles of the Eastern Treatment Plant (ETP) in Melbourne were investigated to assess their suitability as a partial replacement material for the clay in fired-clay bricks. The results of classification tests including liquid limit, plastic limit and sieve analysis indicated that the three biosolids samples were clayey <b>sand</b> and <b>poorly</b> <b>graded</b> silty <b>sand.</b> The linear shrinkage of the biosolids samples varied from 10 % to 15 % and the organic content varied from 6 % to 14 %. Control clay bricks with 0 % biosolids and clay-biosolids bricks with 25 % by weight of biosolids were made and the properties including the compressive strength, shrinkage, density, Initial Rate of Absorption (IRA), and water absorption were determined whereas thermal conductivity was estimated from an empirical model. Furthermore, the effect of adding biosolids on the microstructure of the fired-clay bricks was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that the compressive strength of clay-biosolids bricks were 25. 9, 17. 4 and 16. 2 MPa for the bricks with the three different biosolids samples used in the study. This was mainly because of the addition of biosolids samples with different organic content, which resulted in fired-bricks with higher apparent porosity and thus lower density and compressive strength. The compressive strength of the control fired-clay bricks was 36. 1 MPa...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} was conducted to predict the potential liquefaction that may happen on some areas in Bantul regency the province of Special Region of Yogyakarta. To verify soil profile and N-SPT values, soil exploration was done on 4 (four) selected locations in Bantul regency. The field exploration was then followed by some laboratory experiments in regard to physical and mechanical properties of soil. The results of soil exploration indicates that soil deposit is sand from the ground surface up to the depth of 30, 00 meter, low to medium N-SPT values (15 < N < 30), and high elevation of ground water level (- 5. 00 to - 9. 00). Laboratory tests show that the soil is uniform <b>poorly</b> <b>graded</b> <b>sand</b> with Cu < 3, and Cc < 2, and relatively low internal friction angle in between 24 ° and 31 °. The soil data, then analysed {{by means of the}} method developed by National Centre of Earthquake Engineering Research (NCEER). Analysis of potential liquefaction for 4 selected locations, during low accelerated earthquake (amax/g = 0. 05) there were no liquefaction zone. However, during Yogya earthquake 2006 (amax/g = 0. 09) there were liquefaction zone in between 17. 00 to 19. 00 that was very short and in the depth far below ground level.

In {{order to determine the}} rate of erosion on two type of land surface and their soil properties, several related were soil testing conducted in the Geotechnical Laboratory, UMP. Testing that involved are a particle size distribution, moisture content, specific gravity, falling head, and fine analysis that were carried out in classify properties of the soil sample. The empty surface area is <b>poorly</b> <b>graded</b> <b>sand</b> with Cu 4. The specific gravity test showed that the soil sample empty surface and vegetation surface are 2. 63 mg/m 3 and 2. 58 mg/m 3 respectively. The moisture content for empty surface 1 and surface 2 are 7. 37 % and 9 % respectively. The moisture content for vegetation surface 1 and surface 2 are 4. 56 % and 5. 83 % respectively. Soil erosion is a process of a portion of the soil profile or soil surface detachment to the ambient environment. Four major factors that affect erosion potential are soil characteristics, vegetative cover, topography and climate.

40|$|The dynamic airblast, fragmentation, {{and soil}} ejecta loading environments {{produced}} by the detonation of surface-laid and shallow-buried mines are major threats to lightweight military vehicles. During the past several years, the US Army has focused considerable attention on developing improved methods for predicting the below-vehicle environment from these threats for use by vehicle/armor analysts; thereby, improving the survivability of these platforms. The US Army Engineer Research and Development Center recently completed {{the first year of}} a three-year effort to experimentally and numerically quantify the blast and fragment loading environments on vehicles due to surface and subsurface mine and IED detonations. As part of this research effort, a series of experiments was conducted to quantify the effects of soil parameters on the aboveground blast environments {{produced by the}} detonation of aboveground bottom-surface-tangent, buried top-surface-tangent, and shallow-buried 2. 3 -kg (5 -lb) Composition C 4 charges. The experiments were conducted using three different well characterized soils; 10. 8 % air-filled-voids (AFV) silty sand, 5. 4 % AFV clay, and 29. 8 % AFV <b>poorly</b> <b>graded</b> <b>sand.</b> The combined aboveground loads due to airblast and soil debris were measured by an impulse measurement device. The near-surface airblast overpressure was quantified by a series of side-on measurements above the charges at one elevation and three radial distances.

40|$|Natural sand does always contain {{significant}} amounts of fine particles, known as sand matrix soils. The development of critical state for sand and clay are both well established. However, limited researchers focused on the sand matrix soils. This paper discusses the effect of fines content on the critical state parameters of sand matrix soils. Two types of plastic fines with different plasticity (kaolin and bentonite) were mixed into <b>poorly</b> <b>graded</b> Johor clean <b>sand</b> at different percentages to form the sand matrix soils. The critical state {{was obtained from the}} strain controlled triaxial compression test. All tested soils had been isotropically consolidated to four different effective confining pressures and sheared under consolidated undrained condition until the critical state was ascertained. The critical state line was plotted for each sand matrix soils on space and compression spaces. Based on linear regression analysis, the critical state parameters, M, λ and Γ were obtained and the ranges are from 0. 807 to 1. 102, 0. 062 to 0. 160 and 1. 732 to 2. 431, respectively. The trend of the critical state lines of sand matrix soils in both stress and compression space coincides with the concept of threshold fines content. The threshold fines content identified for sand-kaolin mixtures is 25 % kaolin while it is 20 % bentonite for sand-bentonite mixtures...|$|R
40|$|Sub-surface {{investigation}} was undertaken by drilling boreholes within {{and along the}} Nun River Channel covering three communities of Kaiama, Opokuma and Sabagreia, Bayelsa State, Nigeria. The route extent was over 5 km long and the study was necessitated to provide materials as structural fills for road construction purposes. Eight boreholes were drilled in the three locations to a maximum depth of 14 m from the river bed. Results reveal an overlying ligh grey to dark brown, very fine grained (anhedral), soft to stiff consistency, highly plastic silty clay soil in all the boreholes. This unit varies in depth vary in depth of 1. 0 to 7. 0 m and is proceeding thinner towards the Sabagreia axis from Kaiama. Beneath this overburden lie light grey, medium grained sands, in BH 2 to BH 6 covering the Kaiama and Opokuma axis. The sands are about 7 to 12 m in thickness to the maximum drilled depth of 14 m. In BH 7 and BH 8 in the Sabagreia axis, the underlying sands are coarse grained in texture and about 13 in thickness to the borehole depth. It is recommended that the sand may be derived at minimum depths of about 1. 0 m below the river bed in the Sabagreia area, about 2. 0 m in the Opokuma region and about 4. 5 to 7. 0 at the Kaiama axis.
