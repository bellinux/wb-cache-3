[...] There is criticism from Green Roofs for Healthy Cities {{that the new}} laws are not stringent enough, since they will only apply to residential building that are a minimum of six stories high. By 31 January 2011, industrial buildings were required to render 10% or 2,000m2 of their roofs green. [...] Toronto City Hall's <b>Podium</b> <b>roof</b> was renovated to include a 32,000 square foot rooftop garden, the largest publicly accessible roof in the city.

50|$|Located at 700 2nd Street SW, {{it stands}} at 155 metres (509 feet) or 41 storeys tall and {{was built in}} {{international}} style. It was completed in 1976 {{at a cost of}} $30 million. It was the tallest building in Calgary {{at the time of its}} completion, and once included a restaurant on the top floor. The <b>podium</b> <b>roof</b> currently houses an outdoor patio area with full restaurant and bar. Scotiabank remains one of the tower's key tenants.|$|E

50|$|Different {{techniques}} {{were used to}} make the Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre more environmentally friendly. For example, it has efficient chillers and the <b>podium's</b> <b>roof</b> features solar panels. Moreover, the heat from the condensers of the chillers is recovered. The office and retail parts of the Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre together received a LEED Gold pre-certification in 2013.|$|R

50|$|Designed by Henry Bowyer Lane, the Church of the Holy Trinity is {{approximately}} five storeys tall. Though {{the scale of}} the church is modest, its height is emphasized through details which point upward. In relation to human scale, the church feels big, tall, and strong. Even though it is surrounded by modern buildings, its role as a terminating vista has been preserved for the pedestrian lane from Bay Street to Trinity Square and also for Hagerman Street. It is visible from Toronto City Hall's <b>podium</b> green <b>roof.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1958, an {{international}} architectural competition was launched by Mayor Nathan Phillips {{in order to}} find a design for the new city hall. Revell's winning proposal came first among submissions from 42 countries. It consists of near-twin towers surrounding a white disk-like council chamber, which is mounted on a raised platform with entrances located below. There is also a ramp from connecting the square to the <b>podium</b> <b>roof,</b> from which there is access to the council chamber. The two towers are of unequal height, the east tower being taller than the west. The building was nicknamed [...] "The Eye of the Government" [...] because it resembles a large eye in a plan view. Revell died a year before New City Hall was completed.|$|E
50|$|The plans {{included}} demolishing {{and replacing}} {{the food and}} skate rental kiosk, along {{with the addition of}} an upper level roof terrace overlooking the square; a two-level restaurant at the southwest corner of the square, with outdoor patio and terrace dining; a glass tourist information pavilion at the Queen and Bay Streets corner; a versatile stage structure under a glazed roof canopy; redesigned landscaping along the edges of the square that increases the number of trees, planting, mixed tree species; expansion and enhancement of the Peace Garden, with a flowering tree grove, eternal flame, and reflecting pool; landscaping and a café on the <b>podium</b> <b>roof</b> of City Hall; a restaurant and bar at the Observation Deck level of the east tower of City Hall; upgrading the overhead walkways with wood decking, seating, glass balustrades, light wells and improved access; and a seasonal disappearing water fountain in the centre of the square.|$|E
50|$|Leopoldo Rigoli {{gave the}} {{property}} between the streets Gaona Ave., Segurola, Morón and Sanabria. The club built a <b>roofed</b> <b>podium</b> and five rooms for the players. In 1924 {{they settled in}} at Segurola Street No 1351 and opened its new stadium to play a friendly match against Temperley.|$|R
50|$|On May 29, 2010, Mayor David Miller officially {{opened the}} first phase of the Revitalization project: the <b>Podium</b> Green <b>Roof</b> Garden. The 1.1 ha roof garden {{includes}} diverse plantings of sedums, perennials, and trees; a Central Courtyard beneath the Council Chamber; a Public Terrace at the southeast corner of the roof, shaded by a tree planter; benches and shade structures designed to reveal the movement of the sun; and a 500 m perimeter path which acts as a walking and running circuit around the roof. New lighting has been installed, including new high-efficiency LED floodlights and a perimeter light band, to allow evening events to take place.|$|R
40|$|Many {{cities are}} facing {{problems}} of urban heat island {{and lack of}} greenery space. Green roofs can help mitigate the adverse effects and bring the nature back to the urban area. To apply them effectively, {{it is important to}} evaluate the constraints and identify critical factors for planning and designing the green roofs. Modular green roofs have a good potential to suit high-density urban conditions because they can offer better flexibility, convenience and cost optimisation. This paper presents the research findings to develop modular green roof systems for high-density urban cities. Three different types of modular green roofs, including mat, tray and sack systems, were studied by assessing their designs and characteristics. The urban environment and typical buildings for green roof applications in Hong Kong were evaluated. Useful information was obtained to help design and select modular green roofs that can fit into high-density urban environment. In Hong Kong, the high-rise buildings have very limited roof spaces. It is usually more effective to apply green roofs to the top of medium- or low-rise buildings/structures or the intermediate <b>podium</b> <b>roofs.</b> For existing buildings, as they often have constraints on roof structural loading, it is necessary to select extremely light-weight systems. Modular green roofs can be designed to achieve this by adopting suitable vegetation and components. They can also provide greater flexibility for instant greening, future modification and maintenance. By optimising the manufacturing, nursery and installation processes, it is possible to reduce the unit cost of green roofs and allow wider spread...|$|R

5000|$|The {{ironwork}} {{incorporates the}} lettering [...] "Centenary Place" [...] and supports for the spherical glass lanterns on each side. The <b>podium</b> forms the <b>roof</b> {{of what was}} variously a tramways cash office and lost property office, and is now an automated traffic signal control centre. Access to this basement area is provided by two steep, narrow concrete stairs bounded by Brisbane Tuff retaining walls. The stairs on the western or Wickham Street side are protected by a simple, compressed fibre cement canopy erected in 2000. The Brisbane Tuff loggia {{on the western side}} of the podium was erected as a tramway shelter in 1938.|$|R
50|$|On the {{southern}} side, {{there is a}} statue of Pietà, describing the sadness of Mother Mary while holding the body of Jesus Christ after crucifixion. The wall surrounded the interior have several scenes depicting Stations of the Cross. The cathedral has four pulpits for confession services, two on each side. At the center, {{there is a high}} raised wooden <b>podium</b> with shell-shaped <b>roof</b> for sound reflection. The podium was installed in 1905 and display the images of Hell on the lower side while the images of Jesus' sermons and other scenes are on the middle side. The top of the podium display the scene of Heaven adorned with winged angels. On {{the southern}} side, there is a large Neo-Gothic style organ made in Verschueren, Belgium, then moved and installed in Jakarta in 1988. This organ was taken from Amby village near Maastricht.|$|R
40|$|Sky gardens {{have been}} {{actively}} studied and installed in different cities. Their development potential in compact developing cities has received little attention. Using remote sensing and GIS techniques, this study evaluates the vegetation configuration and development potential of sky gardens in urban Hong Kong, their underlying location, {{land use and}} building factors, and future planning and implementation concerns. Existing sky garden area is limited with sparse vegetation cover and low biomass. Existing <b>podium</b> gardens exceed <b>roof</b> gardens by about nine times. District development age has little effect on existing and potential sky gardens. Old towns have higher potential <b>roof</b> and <b>podium</b> gardens than new towns in most land uses. The effect of land use on potential sky gardens varies greatly by districts. Buildings with 10 - 20 floors have higher potential roof gardens in most districts. Building area is the main determinant of potential roof garden, and population density of potential podium gardens. Three scenarios of realization, namely minimum (20 %), medium (50 %) and maximum (80 %), are adopted to project sky garden provision in individual districts. The projection extends to the contribution of new sky gardens to urban greening in terms of green cover and greening rate in districts. The challenges include susceptibility to typhoon damage in high-rise exposed sites, aggressive weed invasion, lack of roof-slab loading data in old buildings, and poor building maintenance. The opportunities include affordability of the new technology, enabling government policy, and establishment of scientific and research foundation in the local context. The development strategy could aim squarely at stringent technical standards and contractor skill requirement, and programme prioritization based on research findings. The study provides useful hints, approaches and recommendations for a systematic sky-garden action plan in Hong Kong and other similar compact cities. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.
