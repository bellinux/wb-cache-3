40|$|Internet traffic reports {{show that}} YouTube {{is one of}} the major sources of data traffic world-wide. Furthermore, the data traffic shifts from mostly fixed landlines to {{cellular}} data connections where bandwidth is sparse and expensive. Previous studies revealed that YouTube uses a user-friendly HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) strategy which sacrifices bandwidth efficiency to increase the average playback quality for the user. That way, it happens that the same video segment is transmitted in two or more quality levels, but only one can be shown to the user. We denote this as redundant traffic and this work is dedicated to understanding the influence factors on the amount of redundant traffic. This paper presents the results of a large-scale study with over 12, 000 video views over a bottleneck link shaped to various bandwidths. We first evaluate the <b>playback</b> <b>characteristics</b> and show that YouTube’s HAS algorithm linearly increases the average playback quality with the available bandwidth while at the same time video buffering is sublinearly decreased. Furthermore, we identify video-dependent bandwidths which optimize the playback time on a quality level. Afterward, we show that this is achieved by discarding lower layer segments and therefore paid with redundant traffic of up to 40 %. We evaluate the overall efficiency of the system and show that YouTube is able to improve the average quality level by up to 0. 7 quality levels by using this adaptation strategy. However, a penalty of 0. 5 quality levels is paid for it due to the discarded data of the lower quality segments...|$|E

40|$|In September 2008 SanDisk {{announced}} it would begin making music available for purchase on its microSD flash memory card format. 1 The audio files on a slotMusic card are in MP 3 format and are offered free of any digital rights management controls. In addition to containing an 2 ̆ 2 album 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 worth of music (i. e., a slotMusic release generally corresponds to a collection of music issued on other formats such as compact disc), a typical slotMusic card may come pre-loaded with images, video, text, MIDI files, etc. Each card contains 1 GB of memory (well more than what {{is required for the}} pre-loaded content) and the extra memory can be used in whatever way the buyer wishes. Indeed, the preloaded content can be moved to another storage device and the memory card can be formatted and used like any other card. Music on slotMusic cards can be accessed using any device that both accepts microSD cards and is able to play MP 3 files at up to 320 kbps. 2 In addition, some slotMusic cards come packaged with a special microSD-to-USB adapter, which makes it possible to load slotMusic content onto a computer, car stereo, or any other device equipped with a USB jack. Some slotMusic cards are also sold as 2 ̆ 2 bundles, 2 ̆ 2 which in addition to the memory card and USB adapter include special dedicated MP 3 players that accept the microSD format. Many early media responses questioned whether there would be a market for slotMusic, reasoning that music consumers interested in MP 3 s generally are comfortable with downloading them through computer network connections. 3 But a more recent report in the Los Angeles Times argues that the format is doing better than many expected. 4 Still, in April 2010, a search for “slotmusic” in WorldCat retrieves only the record created by this task force as an example, and it is unclear whether any libraries have begun collecting this new format. In terms of cataloging, slotMusic offers a number of challenges. Like much electronic media, the cards exhibit aspects of more than one format, in this case at least sound recordings and electronic resources. Currently, and as the name implies, slotMusic only offers musical sound recordings, but future releases could potentially contain non-musical sound. SlotMusic releases contain no descriptive information on the card itself, making choice of chief sources of information challenging. And slotMusic releases often come 2 ̆ 2 bundled 2 ̆ 2 with peripheral items (such as USB adapters and MP 3 players) that contain no intellectual content, making for interesting accompanying materials notes. And finally, since the devices that can play the cards are numerous, but the technical requirements of those devices are complex, clear notes regarding the <b>playback</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the cards are necessary...|$|E
5000|$|... "Daddy Cool" [...] was {{a novelty}} gimmick record with an unusual, percussive intro by {{producer}} Frank Farian doing rhythmic tic-tic-tics and playing on his teeth with a pencil. Farian also did sing all male voice parts (Bobby Farrell always danced to full <b>playback).</b> His <b>characteristic</b> deep voice sings: [...] "She's crazy like a fool..." [...] and is answered by the bright voices of Liz Mitchell and Marcia Barrett: [...] "...wild about Daddy Cool". This {{line has been}} misheard by listeners as [...] "...what about it Daddy Cool", {{so much that the}} band started singing it that way during live performances. The bass riff kicks in and builds to the instrumental theme followed by the repetitive, nursery rhyme-like verse and chorus twice.|$|R
