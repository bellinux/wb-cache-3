Materials and Methodology: Analysis of the current treatment protocol with respect to safety during CXL. Results: The currently used UVA dose density of 5. 4 J/cm 2 and the corresponding irradiance of 3 mW/cm 2 are below the known damage thresholds of UVA for the corneal endothelium, lens, and retina. Regarding the <b>photochemical</b> <b>damages</b> due to the free radicals the damage threshold for endothelial cells is 0. 35 mW/cm 2. In a 400 μm thick corneal stroma saturated with riboflavin, the irradiance at the endothelial level is about 0. 18 mW/cm 2, which is a factor of 2 smaller than the damage threshold. Conclusion: As long as the corneal stroma treated has a minimal thickness of 400 microns (as recommended), neither corneal endothelium nor deeper structures such as lens and retina will suffer any damages. The light source should provide a homogenous irradiance avoiding hot spots...|$|R

The maximal exposure times based on the ICNIRP safety guidelines for photochemical and thermal injury of the aphakic eye were calculated. Additionally, the effect of various measures that {{reduce the risk of}} phototoxicity was evaluated.  RESULTS—Measurements of the spectrum and energy indicated that the ICNIRP safety guidelines for <b>photochemical</b> retinal <b>damage</b> are exceeded within 1  minute for nine out of 10  combinations tested. With an additional 475  nm long pass filter, light levels below 10  mW, and a distance from light probe to retina of at least 10  mm, the allowable exposure time can be increased up to 13  minutes.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} on light {{damage to the}} retina. <b>Photochemical</b> light <b>damage</b> to the retina can even occur under ambient light {{conditions}} as demonstrated by Noell et al. (1966) They found green light (500 nm) the most powerful in causing retinal damage. Under higher irradiance conditions the action spectrum changes: Short wavelengths are then the most harmful (Ham et al., 1979; Ham, Mueller and Sliney, 1982; Gorgels and van Norren, 1995). With ever increasing irradiance the domain of thermal damage is entered. The highest retinal irradiance used in the experiments in this thesis is approximately 300 mW/ cm. This is a rather high 2 level, but insufficient to increase the retinal temperature over 10 C; the generally accepted safety o limit (Ham et al., 1979). Another argument against thermal damage, is {{the duration of the}} exposure. Thermal damage occurs in less then a second, or not at all (Ham et al., 1979; van Norren, Keunen and Vos, 1998). In the experiments in this thesis longer exposures (from 8 to 100 minutes) were required to cause damage. Thus, we have always dealt with photochemical rather than thermal mechanisms in retinal light damage as investigated in this thesis. The aims of the studies in this thesis were: (1) To document the development of two spectrally determined types of <b>photochemical</b> light <b>damage.</b> (2) To obtain more information about the mechanisms of these two spectral light damage types, and to evaluate possible protectors against retinal light damage...|$|R
5000|$|Nutrients such as nitrate are {{necessary}} for phytoplankton to thrive. Since the ocean’s availability of nutrients varies, diatoms must have ways to adapt under different nutrient levels to maintain healthy populations. When these nutrients are scarce, C. pseudocurvisetus can form alternative dormant life cycles {{to wait out the}} unfavorable conditions. These forms are resting spores and resting cells. The cells not in a dormant state are vegetative cells. Resting spores use excessive amounts of silica to create a heavily silicified cell wall. They then sink to the sediment until conditions are favorable and cause them to germinate into a diatom bloom. If excess silican acid is not available, C. pseudocurvisetus will form resting cells. [...] Silicic acid is limiting to diatoms. In a single population of C. pseudocurvisetus both resting spores and resting cells may be formed, depending on the concentrations of silica. Resting cells resemble vegetative cells, except they have weakly pigmented, shrunken and fragmented chloroplasts. Resting cells and resting spores both have a lower respiratory rate and photosynthetic activity than vegetative cells. Their metabolisms slow down since they are dormant. Both forms accumulate excess neutral lipids to use as stored material to maintain basic metabolic activity and to use for growth once they begin to germinate. Additionally, resting spores also accumulate glucose to store and use as energy while dormant. Both dormant forms have smaller amounts of chlorophyll a than vegetative cells, since neither are actively photosynthesizing. The reduction in chlorophyll a is also necessary because dormant cells in the euphotic zone may accumulate excess photosynthetic energy, causing lethal <b>photochemical</b> <b>damages.</b> Once high enough levels of nitrogen as well as other essential nutrients are available, the dormant forms can germinate into a bloom of vegetative cells. Other environmental factors such as light intensity and temperature must also be at the right levels for germination to occur.|$|R

40|$|Photochemical {{pollution}} is formed {{due to the}} chemical reactions of atmospheric NOx, volatile organic compounds, CO, and CH 4 {{in the presence of}} sunlight. It is a complex, non-linear process influenced by several parameters which change spatially and temporally. Ozone, which is the most common <b>photochemical,</b> <b>damages</b> human health, ecosystems, and man-made materials. It also contributes to climate change. Traditional life cycle impact assessment methodologies have used aggregated impact factors for a country or even for a continent, neglecting these variations. This research assesses the geographical and temporal variability in the characterization factors for emissions of NOx and VOC over the continental US by developing monthly state-level factors. A photochemical air quality modeling system (CAMx-MM 5 -SMOKE) is used to simulate the process of formation, transformation, transport, and removal of photochemical pollutants. Characterization factors are calculated at three levels along the cause-effect chain, namely, fate level, human and ecosystem exposure level, and human effect level. The results indicate that a spatial variability of one order of magnitude and a temporal variability of two orders of magnitude exist in both the fate level and human exposure and effect level characterization factors for NOx. The highest temporal variation in the characterization factors for NOx is seen in the Northeastern US. The summer time characterization factors for NOx are higher than the winter time factors. However, for anthropogenic VOC, the summer time factors are lower than the winter time in almost half of the states. The ecosystem exposure factors for NOx and VOC do not follow a regular pattern and show a spatial variation of about three orders of magnitude. The fate, human exposure, and human effect level factors correlate well as all three are dependent on the atmospheric concentration of ozone. However, they are poorly correlated with the ecosystem exposure factors. Sensitivity analysis of the characterization factors for meteorology and emissions inputs shows variation between negative 90 % and positive 180 %. This is still lower than the spatial and temporal variations. A life cycle assessment case study is included to illustrate the use of the disaggregated characterization factors...|$|R

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that light scattered in the monkey eye during a procedure designed to mimic a clinical panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) can produce a photochemical injury to the foveomacula. METHODS: Ten eyes of 5 adult cynomologous monkeys underwent a PRP using an argon blue-green laser. Three eyes in 2 monkeys underwent a sham PRP, and an additional eye had a PRP with blue filtered slit-lamp illumination. The animals had baseline fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms that were repeated 24 hours after the experimental procedure. Forty-eight hours after the experimental procedure, the eyes were removed and processed for light and electron microscopy. RESULTS: There were no observable changes in the macula on fundus photography or fluorescein angiography 24 hours following PRP. Light and electron microscopy demonstrated changes in the retinal pigment epithelium and the outer photoreceptors, which were confined to the foveola. The control eyes showed no apparent effect from the slit lamp illumination used during the PRP. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of histologic evidence of retinal injury in the foveomacula of the monkey eye after a procedure designed to mimic clinical PRP supports the hypothesis that <b>photochemical</b> retinal <b>damage</b> in the foveola may be associated with this procedure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUVA {{accounts}} for about 95 % of the solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches Earth and most likely contributes to human skin cancer risk. In contrast to UVB, which comprises the remaining 5 % and is absorbed by DNA nucleobases to cause direct photodamage, UVA damages DNA indirectly. It does this largely through its interactions with cellular chromophores that act as photosensitisers to generate reactive oxygen species. Exogenously supplied chemicals, including some widely-prescribed medicines, may also act as photosensitisers and these drugs are {{associated with an increased}} risk of sun-related cancer. Because they amplify the effects of UVA on cells, they provide a means to investigate the mechanisms and effects of UVA-induced photodamage. Here, we describe some of the major lesions induced by two groups of UVA photosensitisers, the DNA thionucleotides and the fluoroquinolone antibiotics. In thionucleotides, replacement of the oxygen atoms of canonical nucleobases by sulfur converts them into strong UVA chromophores that can be incorporated into DNA. The fluoroquinolones are also UVA chromophores. They are not incorporated into DNA and induce a different range of DNA damages. We also draw attention to the potentially important contribution of <b>photochemical</b> protein <b>damage</b> to the cellular effects of photosensitised UVA. Proteins targeted for oxidation damage include DNA repair factors and we suggest that UVA-mediated protein damage may contribute to sunlight-induced cancer risk...|$|R

Mitochondrial viability of all cell types treated with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) or 7 -butyhydroperoxide (BOOH) for 24 hrs revealed that RPE lacking αA-crystallin yielded highly significant decreased cell viability, indicating a possible protection in the presence of αA-. To further investigate the in-vivo protective role of α-crystallins in the retina, in particular αA-. WT mice and αA-crystallin K/O mice were exposed to moderate levels of continuous blue light daily up to 7 days. Visual function was assessed with electroretinography (ERG) on all animals before exposure, immediately after exposure, and after a 10 day recovery period. Retinal morphology was examined immediately after and after a 10 day recovery period from light exposure. Although both strains revealed continual decline in their visual function with little morphological changes, αA- K/O mice degenerated significantly faster during their 10 day recovery period, both functionally and morphologically. Protein analysis revealed that WT mice exhibited statistically significant upregulation of the α-crystallins during their recovery period, while αB-crystallin expression in aA- K/O mice was not significantly upregulated at any time point. Therefore the absence of αA- may effect expression and potency of αB-crystallin in response to stress- related conditions.

To demonstrate that TPE can initiate photochemistry resulting in psoralen–DNA photoadducts, target DNA sequences were incubated with psoTFOs to form triple-helical complexes and then irradiated in liquid solution with pulsed 765 -nm laser light, which is half the quantum energy required for conventional one-photon excitation, as used in psoralen + UV A radiation (320 – 400 nm) therapy. Target DNA acquired strand-specific psoralen monoadducts in a light dose-dependent fashion. To localize DNA damage in a model tissue-like medium, a DNA–psoTFO mixture was prepared in a polyacrylamide gel and then irradiated with a converging laser beam targeting the rear of the gel. The highest number of photoadducts formed at the rear while relatively sparing DNA {{at the front of the}} gel, demonstrating spatial localization of sequence-specific DNA damage by TPE. To assess whether TPE treatment could be extended to cells without significant toxicity, cultured monolayers of normal human dermal fibroblasts were incubated with tritium-labeled psoralen without TFO to maximize detectable damage and irradiated by TPE. DNA from irradiated cells treated with psoralen exhibited a 4 - to 7 -fold increase in tritium activity relative to untreated controls. Functional survival assays indicated that the psoralen–TPE treatment was not toxic to cells.

Various {{aspects of}} the effect of ultraviolet light on mammalian cells grown in vitro are shown and discussed: from photochemical and photobiological aspects of cellular radiobiology to its pertinence to carcinogenesis. The macromolecular basis of the changes in irradiated cells is underlined. An attempt was made to survey some current concepts and ideas that may lead to better understanding of the effects of ultraviolet light on the living mammalian (including human) cells. Although UV-irradiation induces various kinds of molecular damage in mammalian cells two main types of photochemical lesions seem to be critical for the cell survival: pyrimidine dimers and DNA-protein crosslinking. The kinetics of dimer induction, simple in its proportionality with UV exposure, is followed by complex interactions of metabolic processes and repair pathways. The existence of two different modes in removal of pyrimidine dimers from the DNA divides mammalian cells in two main groups. The first group (in which human cells are included) has developed enzymatic mechanism for excising damaged parts from corresponding DNA; the second group (rodent cell lines) has formed the mechanism for postreplication repair of photochemical lesion. UV exposure is followed by intensive reparation activity thus attempting to remove the <b>photochemical</b> <b>damage</b> hindering normal metabolic activities. There are many variations and alternative pathways in these processes which are embracing DNA, various enzymes and other proteins and factors. The repair of each of UV-induced dimers undoubtedly does not function according to the same mechanical cliche, In the first phase of intensive reparation activity the mammalian cell certainly can not remove the complete <b>photochemical</b> <b>damage</b> induced by UV irradiation; perhaps cca 50 - 70 °/o of dimers are repaired in the first few hours after irradiation. To the contrary, it was demonstrated that these cells posses enzymatic mechanisms capable of repairing even greater number of dimers than that induced by exposures on the limit lethality (66). However, in the chromatin of cells there is a portion of <b>photochemical</b> <b>damage</b> that can not be approached by repair mechanism. Nevertheless, mammalian cells can survive in spite of the existence of the fraction of unrepaired dimers in their DNA which was untouched during the first hours after the irradiation. This is managed by bypass mechanism which temporarily enables the cells to »ignore« the existence of fraction of <b>photochemical</b> <b>damage</b> in their DNA. Those remaining dimers are gradually removed in a period of few days. In spite of all its complexity, the phenomena of UV induction of pyrimidine dimers and their repair can not exclusively comprehend mammalian cell tilling by UV light, specially survival variations in distinct phases of the cell cycle. The induction of another photochemical lesion, DNA-to-protein crosslinking, varies through the cell cycle in the similar manner as the cell survival, what indicates the biological importance of this type of damage. Many particularities connected with this type of lesion are still unclear, but there seem to be no repair of DNA-protein crosslinks. In addition with the critical number of unrepaired pyrimidine dimers, DNA-to-protein crosslinking therefore could have the principal role in UV-induced cell killing...|$|E
40|$|When using {{scanning}} laser ophthalmoscopy {{to produce}} {{images of the}} eye fundus, maximum permissible exposure (MPE) limits must be considered. These limits are set out in international standards such as the National Standards Institute ANSI Z 136. 1 Safe Use of Lasers (USA) and BS EN 60825 - 1 : 1994 (UK) and corresponding Euro norms but these documents do not explicitly {{consider the case of}} scanned beams. Our study aims to show how MPE values can be calculated for the specific case of retinal scanning by taking into account an array of parameters, such as wavelength, exposure duration, type of scanning, line rate and field size, and how each set of initial parameters results in MPE values that correspond to thermal or <b>photochemical</b> <b>damage</b> to the retina.

40|$|Abstract: A male welder who {{had been}} working in an {{industrial}} machine plant for more than 20 years experienced acute intense pain in his left eye with continuous lacrimation while performing arc welding in 1997. Later in 1997, at the age of 39 yr, macular edema was found in his left eye. He was diagnosed with macular degeneration (MD) of the left eye in 2002, and with right eye MD in 2004. Radiation in the visible and near infrared (IR) spectra penetrates the eye and is absorbed by the retina, possibly causing thermal or <b>photochemical</b> <b>damage.</b> Such retinal damage may be permanent and, therefore, sight-threatening. The young age and history of an acute painful eye injury are not consistent with age related macular degeneration (AMD) but rather is likely maculopathy caused by welding arc exposure...|$|E
40|$|A {{standard}} operating microscope was modified with a bandpass infrared filter {{in the light}} path and infrared image intensifiers {{for each of the}} 2 eyepieces. We evaluated this system for subretinal injections in normal control dogs and those with a mutation in the rhodopsin gene. Rhodopsin-mutant dogs are a model for human autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, and their retinas degenerate faster when exposed to modest light levels as used in routine clinical examinations. We showed that the mutant retinas developed severe generalized degeneration when exposed to the {{standard operating}} microscope light but not the infrared light. The modified operating microscope provided an excellent view of the ocular fundus under infrared illumination and allowed us to perform subretinal injections in the retinas of the rhodopsin-mutant dogs without any subsequent light-induced retinal degeneration. The first description of light-induced retinal damage showed that exposure of albino rats to visible light intensities ordinarily encountered in the laboratory led to irreversible retinal damage. 1 This finding soon was extended to other species, including rabbits 2 and monkeys. 3 Studies in animal models of retinal degeneration (eg, Royal College of Surgeons rats, ABCA 4 -mutant mice, or rhodopsin-mutant mice and dogs) have emphasized the interplay between the gene mutation and environmental light and demonstrated acceleration of the disease process by light. 4 - 10 The effect of environmental light on disease severity in humans with retinitis pigmentosa has been suggested by case reports, 11 although definitive proof is lacking. However, patients with class B 1 rhodopsin mutations may be at risk of accelerated vision loss with increased light exposures because they have defects in dark (bleaching) adaptation similar to those found in rhodopsin-mutant dogs that demonstrate a high susceptibility to retinal light damage. 8, 12, 13 Many of the emerging therapies for retinal degeneration require the intraocular placement of a reagent or device with the use of an operating microscope. 14, 15 The damaging effect of the microscope light on the normal retina, even with the appropriate filtering of UV light, has been described previously, 16, 17 and there is increased emphasis on reducing the intensity and duration of the exposures. Herein, we describe a modification of an operating microscope with an infrared bandpass filter and a night-vision system to perform surgical interventions in the posterior segment of the eyes of rhodopsin-mutant dogs without the risk of <b>photochemical</b> retinal <b>damage.</b> This modification prevents acceleration of the photoreceptor degeneration that occurs with exposure to modest light levels as used in routine clinical practice. 8 If humans with retinitis pigmentosa are shown to have similar light damage susceptibility, this microscope modification could be considered for surgical procedures such as the subretinal application of gene therapy vectors...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explains}} the term „blue light“. It {{deals with the}} sources of blue light {{and the effects of}} this type of electromagnetic radiance on human body. The focus is concentrate especially on problems, which are evocated of blue light. The biggest danger is the desynchronization of circadian rhythm and <b>photochemical</b> <b>damage</b> of retina – photoretinitis („blue light hazard“). The basic principles of biological processes and the visual system are described here. These processes are controlled by properties of incident light onto the retina of eye. The basic information about artificial sources of blue light commonly used in households and in industry are mentioned {{in the second half of}} work. These light sources were measured and elaborated. The electromagnetic spectrums of sources are portrayed and there is a comparison of sources due circadian effect too...|$|E
40|$|The {{absorption}} of ultraviolet (UV) light by stratospheric ozone {{is crucial to}} the provision of an environment suitable for terrestrial life. Ultraviolet radiation is the part of the solar spectrum with wavelengths between 240 and 400 nm. Photons at wavelengths below about 320 nm can produce <b>photochemical</b> <b>damage</b> to the cells of living organisms. Data suggesting a causative role for UV exposure in squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, melanoma, cataract formation, and (as yet) poorly defined immune suppression comes from epidemiologic studies and, in some cases, clinical observation and experimental work. The author concentrates on the direct health effects of UV radiation, although the factors that lead to stratospheric ozone depletion also exert other powerful influences on the biosphere that will have less predictable direct and indirect effects on human health...|$|E
