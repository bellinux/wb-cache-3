40|$|The {{effects of}} rapid changes of {{circulating}} cortisol levels on ACTH secretion and on corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentrations into hypophysial portal blood were studied in six adult rams. Pharmacological adrenalectomy {{was obtained by}} 3 h metyrapone infusion (100 mg. kg- 1. h- 1). Blockade of cortisol synthesis induced a tenfold increase of plasma ACTH levels accompanied by a moderate increase of CRF secretion (150 % vs <b>preinjection</b> levels) and a large increment of AVP secretion (535 % vs <b>preinjection</b> levels). ACTH levels remained high during the 3 h {{following the end of}} metyrapone infusion. During the same period, CRF secretion was still elevated (231 % vs <b>preinjection</b> levels), while AVP secretion was further stimulated (2, 151 % vs <b>preinjection</b> levels). Subsequent hydrocortisone infusion (66 micrograms. kg- 1. h- 1) for 2 h induced a rapid decrease of both ACTH and AVP secretion, while CRF levels in hypophysial portal blood still remained elevated. These data suggest that changes in ACTH secretion induced by acute modifications of the negative glucocorticoid feedback are, in addition to the well documented direct effect of cortisol on the corticotropes, mainly mediated by variations of hypothalamic AVP secretion...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} {{changes in}} intraocular pressure (IOP) in the 'alternative treatments to Inhibit VEGF in Age-related choroidal Neovascularisation (IVAN) ' trial (registered as ISRCTN 92166560). DESIGN: Randomised {{controlled clinical trial}} with factorial design. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (n= 610) with treatment naïve neovascular age-related macular degeneration were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either ranibizumab or bevacizumab and to two regimens, namely monthly (continuous) or as needed (discontinuous) treatment. METHODS: At monthly visits, IOP was measured <b>preinjection</b> in both eyes, and postinjection in the study eye. OUTCOME MEASURES: The effects of 10 prespecified covariates on <b>preinjection</b> IOP, change in IOP (postinjection minus <b>preinjection)</b> and the difference in <b>preinjection</b> IOP between the two eyes were examined. RESULTS: For every month in trial, there was a statistically significant rise in both the <b>preinjection</b> IOP and the change in IOP postinjection during {{the time in the}} trial (estimate 0. 02  mm Hg, 95 % CI 0. 01 to 0. 03, p< 0. 001 and 0. 03  mm Hg, 95 % CI 0. 01 to 0. 04, p= 0. 002, respectively). There was also a small but significant increase during the time in trial in the difference in IOP between the two eyes (estimate 0. 01  mm Hg, 95 % CI 0. 005 to 0. 02, p< 0. 001). There were no differences between bevacizumab and ranibizumab for any of the three outcomes (p= 0. 93, p= 0. 22 and p= 0. 87, respectively).

Methods: PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were searched to collect relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to July 2016 on the <b>preinjection</b> of dezocine in preventing etomidate-induced myoclonus. Two researchers independently screened literature, extracted data, and evaluated bias risks in accordance with inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then used RevMan 5. 2 to perform the meta-analysis. Results: A total of six RCTs were included in this study. The meta-analysis showed that 1) the <b>preinjection</b> of dezocine can reduce the incidence of etomidate-induced myoclonus (relative risk [RR] = 0. 25, 95 % CI [0. 13, 0. 50], P< 0. 0001), which is consistent with the result of subgroup analysis; 2) the <b>preinjection</b> of dezocine can reduce the incidence of mild, moderate, and severe myoclonus; 3) dezocine was not related to an increasing incidence of etomidate-induced dizziness and nausea (RR = 2. 83, 95 % CI [0. 66, 12. 08], P= 0. 6); and 4) dezocine did not reduce heart rates after the administration of etomidate (mean difference = 1. 06, 95 % CI [– 4. 08, 6. 19], P= 0. 69).

Patients and methods: This was a retrospective examination of cases that received intravitreal ranibizumab for untreated RVO over a period of 12  months. Instead of the conventional three monthly injections, injections were given once during the introductory period. If the recurrence of macular edema was diagnosed during the monthly visit, additional injections were given as needed. There were 21 eyes of 21 patients with branch RVO (BRVO) and ten eyes of ten patients with central RVO (CRVO). The parameters examined included the number of injections over the 12 -month period, improvements in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and the central macular thickness (CMT). For BRVO, <b>preinjection</b> parameters that had an effect on the prognosis of BCVA after the 12 -month period were also examined. Results: The total mean number of injections over the 12 -month period was 3. 4 for CRVO and 2. 1 for BRVO. For CRVO, the BCVA in log minimum angular resolution changed from a <b>preinjection</b> value of 0. 80 to 0. 55 at 12  months. For BRVO, the change was from 0. 51 to 0. 30. For all diseases, BCVA improved after 12  months compared with the <b>preinjection</b> values (P< 0. 05). There was improvement in the CMT, and the CRVO changed from 765. 0  µm at <b>preinjection</b> to 253. 5  µm 12  months later. BRVO changed from 524. 1 to 250. 1  µm, and <b>preinjection</b> BCVA was associated with a prognosis of visual acuity after 12  months of the initial injection (P= 0. 0485).

In {{contrast to the}} saturation kinetics found in rats, intravenous injections of 10 - 300 mg/kg for both NCAs showed a linear correlation between the area under the curve (AUC) and the dose. The elimination t 1 / 2 was 25 and 30 min for Suc-HSA and Aco-HSA, respectively. <b>Preinjections</b> of an excess of formaldehyde-treated albumin (Form-HSA) resulted in plasma levels that were 3 - and 4 -fold higher for Aco-HSA and Suc-HSA, respectively. These data indicate that elimination is at least partly (scavenger) receptor-mediated.

Understanding the {{internal}} dynamics of prostate injections, particularly injection pattern distribution {{is a key}} step to developing new therapies for prostate disease that may be best served with a direct injection approach. Due to excellent properties involving liquid contrast agents, MRI {{can be used for}} targeting and monitoring of injections into organs and tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Eleven intraprostatic injections were performed in vivo with canines using a custom transrectal guiding and imaging system for use in a standard 1. 5 T MR scanner. In addition, 25 injections were performed on excised cadaveric human prostates, using a MedRad Spectris TM injector system. MRI was used to guide the injections and monitor intraparenchymal injection distribution. RESULTS. T 1 and T 2 -weighted MR images were correlated with histology to produce threedimensional data sets {{that can be used to}} analyze trends in injection patterns. This analysis was used to develop strategies for injection prediction such as gadolinium <b>preinjections</b> and diffusion-weighted imaging guidance. In addition, a rough model of prostate injections is described, and a preliminary injection guide is developed that takes into account the individual clinician’s goals for therapy. CONCLUSIONS. MR visualization of injected therapeutic agents allows for prediction and monitoring of drug distributions, possibly improving efficacy and reducing side effects.

40|$|Searching the {{sequence}} databases has revealed two novel cytokines: interleukin- 23 (IL- 23) and IL- 27. These cytokines are quite similar to, but clearly distinct from IL- 12 in their structures and T-cell stimulatory fashions. In contrast to IL- 12, however, {{little is known}} about the roles of IL- 23 and IL- 27 in the immune regulation. Previously, we evaluated the prime-boost immunization consisting of priming and the first boosting with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) -core expression plasmid, followed by a second boosting with recombinant adenovirus expressing HCV core for induction of HCV core-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in BALB/c mice. The present study demonstrates that HCV-specific CTL induction was greatly enhanced by coinoculation of an IL- 12 expression plasmid in the prime-boost immunization, indicating the potent adjuvant activity of IL- 12. We investigated whether similar adjuvant effects could be exerted by either IL- 23 or IL- 27 in a prime-boost immunization with HLA-A* 0201 transgenic mice. Coadministration of either an IL- 23 or an IL- 27 expression plasmid, as well as an IL- 12 expression plasmid, in a prime-boost immunization enhanced induction of HCV-specific CTLs and led to dramatic increases in the numbers of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) -producing, HCV-specific CD 8 + cells. Further, <b>preinjections</b> of IL- 12, IL- 23, or IL- 27 expression plasmids before immunization resulted in great increases in the number of IFN-γ-producing, HCV-specific CD 8 + cells in response to immunization with recombinant adenovirus.

With a rat model of intrastriatal DA injection, we studied the molecular events involved in DA toxicity. Intrastriatal injections of DA in amounts from 1 to 2 micromol result in apoptotic cell death, as indicated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase labeling of DNA strand breaks and Klenow polymerase-catalyzed [(32) P]deoxycytidine triphosphate-labeled DNA laddering. Injections of DA produce a strong and prolonged activated protein 1 (AP- 1) activity that contains c-fos, c-jun, and phosphorylated c-jun protein. DA injections also stimulate the activity of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), an oxidative stress-responsive transcription factor. Injection of curcumin at a dose that selectively inhibits AP- 1 activation without affecting NF-kappaB activity attenuates DNA laddering induced by DA. <b>Preinjection</b> with SN 50, a specific permeable recombinant NF-kappaB translocation inhibitor peptide, reduces DA-induced NF-kappaB activation and apoptosis. Moreover, <b>preinjection</b> of the antioxidant GSH significantly inhibits both DA-induced activation of transcription factors AP- 1 and NF-kappaB and subsequent apoptosis.

Although liver endothelial cells did not contribute any longer to the hepatic uptake of 1 J 5 l-t-PA after <b>preinjection</b> of MjL; (2 mg/kg), an increased uptake by hepatocytes partly compensated for the reduced endothelial cell uptake of t-PA. As this parenchymal cell uptake may be mediated by LRP, it was studied whether an additional reduction in t-PA clearance could be achieved by simultaneous blocking of LRP via <b>preinjection</b> of the 39 kDa protein (RAP; 40 mg/kg). RAP <b>preinjection</b> reduced the clearance of t-PA (t 1 / 8 = 5. 9 ± 0. 5 min; P< 0. 001) and reduced liver uptake from 82. 8 ± 1. 3 % to 60. 4 ± 1. 2 % of the injected dose (P< 0. 01) The combined pretreatment with M and RAP almost fully abolished liver uptake (10. 6 ± 6 % of the injected dose; P< 0. 0001) and t-PA clearance (tt/ 2 = 16 ± 2. 5 min; P< 0. 0001). In conclusion, therapeutic levels of serum t-PA can be maintained for a prolonged time-span by circumventing both LRP and the mannose receptor-mediated liver uptake of t-PA in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the {{efficiency}} of pre-administration of hypoxen in experimental cardiac contusion in order to lower the degree of posttraumatic myocardial dysfunction. Materials and methods: experiments were carried out on non-inbred albino male rats anesthetized with sodium thiopental. Cardiac contusion was reproduced by an original device that imitated a blow of the steering wheel to the anterior chest, as that observed when a moving car clashes against an obstacle. Some animals were traumatized after pre-administration of hypoxen. An electrocardiogram, left carotid blood pressure (BP), an integral rheogram, and the first derivative of a differential rheogram were recorded prior to cardiac contusion simulation and in different posttraumatic periods. Stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and total peripheral vascular resistance were calculated. Results. <b>Preinjection</b> of hypoxen completely prevented the development of sinus arrhythmia, paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia, and intraatrial and intraventricular conduction disturbances, irrespective of the baseline BP. In a subgroup of animals with a baseline low BP, the agent reduced the incidence of bradycardia by 1. 5 times, heterotopic rhythms by 5. 3 times, ventricular premature contractions by 6 times, atrioventricular (AV) block by 5. 3 times and diminished {{the changes in the}} terminal of a ventricular complex by 6. 3 times. In a subgroup of animals with baseline normal BP, bradycardia and heterotopic rhythms were recorded 2 and 7 times more infrequently recorded; ventricular premature beats, AV block, and ST-segment displacement were present in none case. <b>Preinjection</b> of hypoxen improved myocardial contractility, as evidenced by 17 — 25 % SV increases within an hour posttraumatically. However, significant arterial hypotension and lowered CO due to bradycardia in most experimental animals during the <b>preinjection</b> of hypoxen before injury and throughout the posttraumatic period caused a ten-fold increase in mortality rates as compared with the non-hypoxen group. Conclusion. The hemodynamic effects of hypoxen can substantially limit the possibility of using the agent to diminish the degree of posttraumatic cardiac dysfunction. Key words: experimental cardiac contusion, central hemodynamics, hypoxen...|$|E
40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the analgesic effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on <b>preinjection</b> sites in patients scheduled for third molar removal. Study Design. This double-blind randomized controlled trial included 163 healthy patients undergoing third molar extractions. The study participants were randomly divided into an LLLT and a placebo group. Objective and subjective data sets were obtained from physiologic feedback (heart rate and sweat response) and a questionnaire, respectively. In the LLLT group, each targeted injection site was irradiated twice with 198 mW continuous wave for 30 seconds with a 0. 088 cm(2) focal spot at an applied energy of 5. 94 J and fluence of 67. 50 J/cm(2). Measurements were recorded from 4 time-points during data acquisition. Results. There was no significant difference between the LLLT and placebo groups in pain experience scores associated with the injected sites for maxillary or mandibular third molar extractions. Mean heart rates before and during injection were lower in the LLLT group than in the placebo group for both maxillary and mandibular regions. No statistically significant differences were observed for any remaining parameters. Conclusions. The present data indicated that <b>preinjection</b> LLLT did not effectively decrease the pain felt during local anesthetic injections before third molar surger...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We {{investigated}} {{the efficacy of}} transurethral injection of Macroplastique bulking agent (Uroplasty) for male stress urinary incontinence (SUI) after prostate surgery. Materials and Methods: This retrospective review included men with SUI treated by transurethral injection for symptoms resulting from prostate surgery. Patients were evaluated at 1 month and 6 months after injection by determining the number of pads used per day and changes in incontinence symptoms. Treatment success was defined as use of 1 pad or fewer per day combined with subjective symptom improvement. Results: The study population comprised 30 men {{with a mean age}} of 66. 1 ± 5. 3 years. Of the 30 patients, 24 (80. 0 %) underwent prostate cancer surgery and the remaining 6 (20. 0 %) underwent surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia. The <b>preinjection</b> pad number was 2. 9 ± 1. 9 pads per day. After injection treatment, the mean follow-up period was 9. 3 ± 12. 7 months and the success rate was 43 % (13 / 30) at 1 month and 32 % (6 / 19) at 6 months. Injection was more likely to result in a successful outcome in patients with no <b>preinjection</b> radiation treatment history and higher abdominal leak point pressur...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{induction}} of HSP 70 by administration of geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) leads to protection against ischemia/reperfusion injury. The present study was performed to determine the effect of GGA on the survival of mice and on brain damage under acute hypobaric hypoxia. The data showed that the mice injected with GGA survived significantly longer than control animals (survival time of 9. 55 [*]±[*] 3. 12  min, n[*]=[*] 16 vs. controls at 4. 28 [*]±[*] 4. 29  min, n[*]=[*] 15, P[*]<[*] 0. 005). Accordingly, the cellular necrosis or degeneration of the hippocampus and the cortex induced by sublethal hypoxia for 6  h could be attenuated by <b>preinjection</b> with GGA, especially in the CA 2 and CA 3 regions of the hippocampus. In addition, the activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) of the hippocampus and the cortex was increased after exposure to sublethal hypoxia for 6  h but could be inhibited by the <b>preinjection</b> of GGA. Furthermore, the expression of HSP 70 was significantly increased at 1  h after GGA injection. These results suggest that administration of GGA improved survival rate and prevented acute hypoxic damage to the brain and that the underlying mechanism involved induction of HSP 70 and inhibition of NOS activity...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} {{whether there are}} any demographic or urodynamic differences in patients with idiopathic overactive bladder (I-OAB) that respond and {{do not respond to}} intradetrusor injections of botulinum toxin-A (BTX-A). Methods. This represents a secondary analysis of data collected from an investigator initiated randomized trial designed to evaluate clinical differences in outcomes for 100 versus 150 U BTX-A in patients with I-OAB. <b>Preinjection</b> demographic and urodynamic data were collected. Patients were evaluated 12 weeks after injection and were determined to be responders or nonresponders as defined by our criteria. Statistical comparisons were made between groups. Results. In patients with overactive bladder without incontinence (OAB-Dry), there were no variables {{that could be used to}} predict response to BTX-A. On univariate analysis, younger patients with overactive bladder with incontinence (OAB-Wet) were more likely to respond to BTX-A than older patients. However, this relationship was no longer statistically significant on multivariate analysis. Conclusions. We were unable to identify any <b>preinjection</b> demographic or urodynamic parameters that could aid in predicting which patients will achieve clinical response to BTX-A. Future studies are necessary to further evaluate this question. Copyright © 2009 Brian L. Cohen et al.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{intramammary}} injection of recombinant bovine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rboGM-CSF, 400 μg/ 10 mL) on quarter milk levels of chemiluminescence (CL) activity, and somatic cell count (SCC) and shedding pattern of Staphylococcus aureus was investigated. Ten Holstein cows, naturally infected with S. aureus were used, with either early-stage or late-stage subclinical mastitis. Injection of rboGM-CSF caused a remarkable increase in milk CL activity with a peak at 6 h after the cytokine injection in the early- and late-stage groups. In the early-stage group, milk SCC stayed around <b>preinjection</b> level at 6 h, rose significantly on days 1 and 2, and {{was followed by}} a smooth and significant decline to an under <b>preinjection</b> level (below 200 000 cells/mL) on day 7 postinjection. Alternatively, in the late-stage group, milk SCC rose significantly at 6 h after the cytokine injection and maintained high levels thereafter. The milk S. aureus count decreased drastically by the cytokine injection in the early-stage group. The bacterial count was moderately decreased in the late-stage group, but increased back to preinoculation levels on day 7 after the cytokine injection. The results suggest that the rboGM-CSF has a potential as a therapeutic agent for S. aureus infection causing subclinical mastitis of dairy cows, if the cytokine is applied at the initial stage of infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of detomidine {{with or without}} atropine sulfate premedication in producing sedation and analgesia for arthrocentesis was studied in 12 horses. The effects were evaluated by monitoring heart and respiratory rates, borborygmi, distance from the lower lip to the floor, systolic blood pressure, and response to needle insertion. Either atropine or saline (as a placebo) was administered immediately prior to detomidine. All drugs were administered intravenously. Measurements were taken prior to drug injection and at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 120, 180 and 240 minutes postinjection. Detomidine with atropine resulted in significantly higher heart rates than detomidine without atropine for the three hours of observation. Borborygmi were significantly decreased for four hours following detomidine with atropine and for three hours following detomidine without atropine, when compared to <b>preinjection</b> levels. Systolic blood pressure was significantly increased for 15 minutes following detomidine and atropine compared to the <b>preinjection</b> level. The head was markedly lowered for 60 minutes with either treatment. Atropine prevented the bradyarrhythmia and bradycardia induced by detomidine, but it induced a tachycardia. A satisfactory response for needle insertion and adequate synovial fluid aspiration was achieved in 95 % of the trials with detomidine, with or without atropine sulfate premedication. The results suggest that, although atropine prevents bradyarrhythmia and bradycardia following detomidine, administering detomidine without atropine is satisfactory for arthrocentesis in untrained horses...|$|E
40|$|Human {{serum albumin}} (HSA) derivatized with cis-aconitic {{anhydride}} (Aco-HSA) was covalently coupled to liposomes (Aco-HSA-Lip). Aco-HSA-Lip were cleared {{from the blood}} and {{taken up by the}} liver within 30 minutes after injection into a rat. In the liver especially endothelial cells {{and to a lesser extent}} Kupffer cells were responsible for this uptake, which could be inhibited by <b>preinjection</b> with poly inosinic acid. Binding and competition experiments with cultured liver endothelial and Kupffer cells revealed that the uptake of Aco-HSA-Lip was mediated by scavenger receptors.
