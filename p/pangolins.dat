5|$|Several {{species of}} {{elongate}} organisms form their bodies into a loop to roll, including certain caterpillars (which do so to escape danger), tiger beetle larvae, myriapods, mantis shrimp, Armadillidiidae, and Mount Lyell salamanders. Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily {{to protect their}} bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in <b>pangolins,</b> wheel spiders, hedgehogs, armadillos, Armadillo girdled lizards, isopods, and fossilized trilobites. <b>Pangolins</b> and wheel spiders have been observed to purposely roll away from predators. These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering their shape to generate a propulsive force.|$|E
5|$|Allen backed Washington state {{initiative}} 1401 {{to prohibit}} the purchase, sale {{and distribution of}} products made from 10 endangered species including elephants, rhinos, lions, tigers, leopards, cheetahs, marine turtles, <b>pangolins,</b> sharks and rays. The initiative gained enough signatures {{to be on the}} state's ballot on November 3, 2015, and passed.|$|E
5|$|Anteaters, aardvarks, <b>pangolins,</b> {{echidnas}} and numbats {{have special}} adaptations for {{living on a}} diet of ants. These adaptations include long, sticky tongues to capture ants and strong claws to break into ant nests. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) {{have been found to}} feed on ants. About 12%, 16%, and 4% of their faecal volume in spring, summer, and autumn, respectively, is composed of ants.|$|E
50|$|Though {{meat and}} scales {{are the primary}} drivers of the <b>pangolin</b> trade, there are also other less common parts and uses. <b>Pangolin</b> wine is {{produced}} by boiling rice wine with a baby <b>pangolin.</b> It is purported to have various healing properties, such as for treatment of skin disease and improved breathing. <b>Pangolin</b> blood is similarly viewed by some as having medicinal value. <b>Pangolin</b> skins have also been trafficked. In 2015, Uganda reported it had seized two tons of <b>pangolin</b> skins.|$|R

5|$|Bats are placental mammals. They were {{formerly}} grouped in the superorder Archonta, {{along with}} the treeshrews (Scandentia), colugos (Dermoptera), and the primates, because of the apparent similarities between Megachiroptera and such mammals. Genetic evidence places bats in the superorder Laurasiatheria, with its sister taxon as Fereuungulata, which includes carnivorans, <b>pangolins,</b> odd-toed ungulates, even-toed ungulates, and cetaceans. One study places Chiroptera as a sister taxon to odd-toed ungulates (Perissodactyla).|$|E
5|$|Leopards {{are found}} in hilly areas but may also venture into the low land jungles. Small cats in the park include the jungle cat, fishing cat and leopard cat. Other mammals include barking deer, sambar deer, hog deer and chital, sloth and Himalayan black bears, Indian grey mongoose, otters, yellow-throated martens, Himalayan goral, Indian <b>pangolins,</b> and langur and rhesus macaques. Owls and nightjars can be heard during the night.|$|E
5|$|Louse (plural: lice) is {{the common}} name {{for members of the}} order Phthiraptera, which {{contains}} nearly 5,000 species of wingless insect. Lice are obligate parasites, living externally on warm-blooded hosts which include every species of bird and mammal, except for monotremes, <b>pangolins,</b> bats and cetaceans. Lice are vectors of diseases such as typhus.|$|E
50|$|The long-tailed <b>pangolin</b> (Phataginus tetradactyla), {{also called}} the African black-bellied <b>pangolin,</b> or ipi, is an {{arboreal}} <b>pangolin</b> belonging to the family Manidae, in the order Pholidota. The common names for this species stem from physical characteristics, such as the extremely long tail or the dark hairs that cover the underside of their bodies and limbs. <b>Pangolin</b> comes from the Malay word pengguling, meaning “something that rolls up”.|$|R
40|$|The Indian <b>Pangolin</b> (Manis crassicaudata) {{is arguably}} the least studied species of all Asiatic <b>pangolin</b> species and, is the solitary <b>pangolin</b> species {{recorded}} in Sri Lanka. Growing concerns over their population decline due to poaching and trading has triggered a move to uplift Indian <b>Pangolin</b> to Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). However, lack of reliable scientific information on the behavior, ecology and threats {{for the survival of}} Indian <b>Pangolin</b> remains a major limitation in conservation of the species. This narrative review discusses the current knowledge on Indian <b>Pangolin</b> with special reference to Sri Lanka, and identifies key research priorities for better conservation planning of the species...|$|R

5|$|Longrich et al. {{pointed out}} that the robust forelimbs and {{enlargement}} of a single finger in ingeniine oviraptorids is similar to that seen in modern animals that eat ants and termites, such as anteaters and <b>pangolins,</b> but the morpholology of ingeniine jaws does not support them being insectivorous. The researchers found that the function of ingeniine forelimbs was unclear, but suggested that they could have been used for scratching, tearing, or digging, though not prey capture.|$|E
5|$|The robust nasal bones, {{preserved}} {{in a single}} specimen, are widest at the front, a feature unusual among placentals that is also seen in armadillos, and are also unusually flat. The ethmoid labyrinth, in the nasal cavity, was large, suggesting that Plesiorycteropus had {{a good sense of}} smell. A much larger part of the nasal septum, which separates the left and right nasal cavities, is ossified than usual in other mammals; MacPhee could find a similar condition only in sloths, which have a very short nose. The lacrimal bone is relatively large. At it is a single lacrimal canal, which opens near the suture between the frontal and lacrimal bones, like in lipotyphlans. There is a small tubercle (absent in aardvarks) near this opening. The orbital cavity, which houses the eyes, is relatively short, similar to the situation in <b>pangolins</b> and armadillos. A distinct tubercle is present on the suture between the frontal and parietal bones in P.germainepetterae, but not P.madagascariensis. P.madagascariensis has a more expansive braincase and a less pronounced narrowing between the orbits. The foramen rotundum, an opening in the bone of the orbit, is present. The optic canal, which houses the nerves leading to the eyes, is narrow, suggesting that the eyes were small, similar to many other tenrecoids. As in <b>pangolins</b> and xenarthrans, little of the squamosal bone can be seen from above. The temporal lines on the braincase, which anchor muscles, are located lower in P.germainepetterae. Like in aardvarks, the parietals are relatively large. An interparietal bone is present. Unlike in anteaters and <b>pangolins,</b> the occiput (the back of the skull) is flat and vertical. Plesiorycteropus lacks notches above the foramen magnum (the opening that connects the brain to the spinal cord), which are present in aardvarks. The nuchal crest, a projection on the occiput, is straight in P.madagascariensis, but in P.germainepetterae it is interrupted in the middle, similar to the situation in armadillos and hyraxes.|$|E
5|$|Paratheria is an {{obsolete}} {{term for}} a taxonomic group including the xenarthran mammals (sloths, anteaters, and armadillos) and various groups thought {{to be related to}} them. It was proposed by Oldfield Thomas in 1887 to set apart the sloths, anteaters, armadillos, and <b>pangolins,</b> usually classified as placentals, from both marsupial and placental mammals, an arrangement that received little support from other workers. When teeth of the extinct gondwanathere mammals were first discovered in Argentina in the 1980s, they were thought to be related to xenarthrans, leading to renewed attention for the hypothesis that xenarthrans are not placentals. However, by the early 1990s, gondwanatheres were shown to be unrelated to xenarthrans, and xenarthrans are still considered to be placentals.|$|E
50|$|China {{has passed}} much more {{legislation}} for <b>pangolin</b> protection than other countries, because the species' population has drastically declined in China {{over the last}} few decades. This is the direct result of extreme poaching for <b>pangolin</b> scales and meat. Clearly, though, legislation is not enough and alternatives to laws need to be considered. The IUCN SSC <b>Pangolin</b> Specialist Group made a proposal in July 2014 to increase awareness, funding, and research for <b>pangolin</b> conservation. Some of the plan's highlights include making protocols to monitor <b>pangolin</b> populations, establishing a consumption index of <b>pangolin</b> products, using DNA analysis to determine variation between and within species, and identifying species strongholds to determine best allocation of resources. Furthermore, the conservation plan aims to increase patrol-based monitoring around stronghold populations, increase awareness and education about the severity of the problem, and, most importantly, implement a demand reduction strategy for <b>pangolin</b> meat and scales.|$|R
40|$|Wingless (Wg) {{signaling}} regulates {{expression of}} its target genes via <b>Pangolin</b> and Armadillo, and their interacting cofactors. In {{the absence of}} Wg, <b>Pangolin</b> mediates transcriptional repression. In the presence of Wg, <b>Pangolin,</b> Armadillo, and a cohort of coactivators mediate transcriptional activation. Here we uncover Coop (corepressor of Pan) as a Pangolin-interacting protein. Coop and <b>Pangolin</b> form a complex on DNA containing a Pangolin/TCF-binding motif. Overexpression of Coop specifically represses Wg target genes, while loss of Coop function causes derepression. Finally, we show that Coop antagonizes the binding of Armadillo to <b>Pangolin,</b> providing a mechanism for Coop-mediated repression of Wg target gene transcription...|$|R
50|$|The Philippine <b>pangolin</b> or Palawan <b>pangolin,</b> {{also known}} as the balintong (Manis culionensis), is a <b>pangolin</b> species endemic to the Palawan {{province}} of the Philippines. Its habitat includes primary and secondary forests, as well as surrounding grasslands. This species is moderately common within its limited range, but is at risk due to heavy hunting because of its valued scales and meat. This species is distinguished from the closely related Sunda <b>pangolin</b> by its smaller body-to-tail ratio, smaller scales, and a shorter head.|$|R
5|$|Spotted hyenas {{have also}} been found to catch fish, tortoises, humans, black rhino, hippo calves, young African elephants, <b>pangolins</b> and pythons. There {{is at least one}} record of four hyenas killing an adult or subadult {{hippopotamus}} in Kruger National Park. The fossil record indicates that the now extinct European spotted hyenas primarily fed on Przewalski's horses, Irish elk, reindeer, red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, wild boar, ibex, steppe wisent, aurochs, and woolly rhinoceros. Spotted hyenas are thought to be responsible for the dis-articulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons. Such large carcasses were an optimal food resource for hyenas, especially at the end of winter, when food was scarce. Spotted hyenas may consume leather articles such as boots and belts around campsites. Jane Goodall recorded spotted hyenas attacking or savagely playing with the exterior and interior fittings of cars, and the species is thought to be responsible for eating car tyres.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pangolins,</b> {{a type of}} mammal {{covered in}} thick scales, roll into a tight ball when threatened. <b>Pangolins</b> have been {{reported}} to roll away from danger, by both gravity and self-powered methods. A pangolin in hill country in Sumatra, to flee from the researcher, ran {{to the edge of a}} slope and curled into a ball to roll down the slope, crashing through the vegetation, and covering an estimated 30 metres or more in 10 seconds.|$|E

40|$|Indian <b>Pangolin</b> (Manis crassicaudata), an {{endangered}} mammalian species under IUCN red list. In India, small population of Chines <b>Pangolin</b> (Manis pentadactyla) are {{also present in}} the eastern part and protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 as a schedule I species along with Indian <b>Pangolin.</b> In national and international market the Indian <b>Pangolin</b> are highly in trade principally for its meat and scales. In curbing illegal wildlife, trade of Indian <b>Pangolin</b> on national and international level wildlife DNA forensics {{plays an important role in}} the identification of species from the seized material. We received n =  15 wildlife seizures assumed to be the scales of <b>Pangolin</b> from different state forest and the custom department for molecular analysis. The seizures sequenced for two mitochondrial genes i. e. Cyt b and 16 S rRNA, which are often used in wildlife DNA forensic to species identification. The sequences thus generated from these seizures compared to the NCBI database through blast search tool and our laboratory-generated references, yielding 100 % similarity with Indian <b>Pangolin.</b> We identified twelve (n =  12) Cyt b and five (n =  5) 16 S rRNA species specific SNPs, fixed in Indian <b>Pangolin.</b> This study shows, the importance of authenticated references, DNA sequence data availability, highlighting the application of DNA forensics in identifying species from scales...|$|R
