Because <b>type</b> <b>III</b> (free protein <b>S)</b> deficiency {{is still not}} established as risk factor for thrombosis, we assessed the absolute risk of venous and arterial thromboembolism in a family cohort study. Annual incidences in first-degree relatives with and without protein <b>S</b> deficiency <b>type</b> <b>III</b> were compared. Probands had experienced thrombosis and had either the prothrombin G 20210 A mutation, increased factor VIII:C levels or hyperhomocysteinemia. Relatives were tested for these thrombophilic disorders and factor V Leiden. Levels of antithrombin, protein C, total and free protein S, and factor XI:C were additionally measured. Of 500 relatives enrolled, 105 were excluded from analysis {{because they could not}} be classified, due to acquired conditions. Protein <b>S</b> deficiency <b>type</b> <b>III</b> was demonstrated in 60 / 395 remaining relatives (15 %). Other thrombophilic defects were equally distributed among deficient and nondeficient relatives. Annual incidences of venous thromboembolism were 0. 28 per 100 person-years [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 09 - 0. 66] in deficient relatives versus 0. 20 per 100 person-years (95 % Cl, 0. 12 - 0. 30) in non-deficient relatives [hazard ratio, 1. 4 (95 % Cl, 0. 4 - 4. 0) ]. For arterial thromboembolism these values were 0. 16 per 100 person-years (95 % Cl, 0. 03 - 0. 46) versus 0. 10 per 100 person-years (95 % Cl, 0. 05 - 0. 19) [hazard ratio, 1. 5 (95 % Cl, 0. 3 - 6. 0) ].

Phenol-water-extracted lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from all S. flexneri serotypes possessing either group 6 antigen or both <b>type</b> <b>III</b> antigen and group 6 antigen were subjected to de-O-acetylation by weak alkali treatment. Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of serotype 3 a native LPS and de-O-acetylated LPS were completely resolved, confirming the established structure (L. Kenne, B. Lindberg, K. Petersson, E. Katzenellenbogen, and E. Romanowska, Eur. J. Biochem. 91 : 279 - 284, 1978) and proving that no other structural alteration was introduced by the treatment. Both native and de-O-acetylated LPSs of serotypes 1 b, 3 a, 3 b, and 4 b were tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against four absorbed rabbit anti-S. flexneri antisera and three monoclonal antibodies with specificity for different parts of the <b>S.</b> flexneri <b>type</b> <b>III</b> antigen and group 6 antigen.

40|$|SummarySalmonella Typhimurium {{specifically}} targets antigen-sampling microfold (M) {{cells to}} translocate across the gut epithelium. Although M cells represent a small proportion of the specialized follicular-associated epithelium (FAE) overlying mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues, their density increases during Salmonella infection, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Using in vitro and in vivo infection models, we {{demonstrate that the}} <b>S.</b> Typhimurium <b>type</b> <b>III</b> effector protein SopB induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of FAE enterocytes into M cells. This cellular transdifferentiation {{is a result of}} SopB-dependent activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling leading to induction of both receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and its receptor RANK. The autocrine activation of RelB-expressing FAE enterocytes by RANKL/RANK induces the EMT-regulating transcription factor Slug that marks epithelial transdifferentiation into M cells. Thus, via the activity of a single secreted effector, S. Typhimurium transforms primed epithelial cells into M cells to promote host colonization and invasion...|$|R

40|$|Shigella flexneri {{contact with}} enterocytes induces {{a burst of}} protein {{secretion}} via its <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion apparatus (TTSA) as an initial step in cellular invasion. We have previously reported that IpaD is positioned at the TTSA needle tip (M. Espina et al., Infect. Immuno. 74 : 4391 - 4400, 2006). From this position, IpaD senses small molecules in the environment to control the presentation of IpaB to the needle tip. This step occurs without <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion induction or IpaC recruitment to the S. flexneri surface. IpaC is then transported to the S. flexneri surface when target cell lipids are added, and this event presumably mimics host cell contact. Unlike IpaB mobilization, IpaC surface presentation is closely linked to secretion induction. This study demonstrates that sphingomyelin and cholesterol are key players in <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion induction and that they appear to interact with IpaB to elicit IpaC presentation at the TTSA needle tip. Furthermore, IpaB localization at the needle tip prior to membrane contact provides the optimal set of conditions for host cell invasion. Thus, the <b>S.</b> flexneri <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion system can be induced in a stepwise manner, with the first step being the stable association of IpaD with the needle tip, the second step being the sensing of small molecules by IpaD to mobilize IpaB to the tip, and the third step being the interaction of lipids with IpaB to induce IpaC localization at the needle tip concomitant with translocon insertion into the host membrane and <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion induction...|$|R

40|$|SummaryActin {{polymerization}} in the mammalian cytosol can be locally {{activated by}} mechanisms that relieve the autoinhibited state of N-WASP, an initiator of actin assembly, {{a process that}} also requires the protein Toca- 1. Several pathogenic bacteria, including Shigella, exploit this host feature to infect and disseminate efficiently. The Shigella outer membrane protein IcsA recruits N-WASP, which upon activation at the bacterial surface mediates localized actin polymerization. The molecular role of Toca- 1 in N-WASP activation during physiological or pathological actin assembly processes in intact mammalian cells remains unclear. We show that actin tail initiation by S. flexneri requires Toca- 1 for the conversion of N-WASP from a closed inactive conformation to an open active one. While N-WASP recruitment is dependent on IcsA, Toca- 1 recruitment is instead mediated by <b>S.</b> flexneri <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion effectors. Thus, S. flexneri independently hijacks two nodes of the N-WASP actin assembly pathway to initiate localized actin tail assembly...|$|R

In contrast, both free and total protein S levels are low in type I deficiency. To elucidate the molecular mechanism behind the selective deficiency of free protein <b>S</b> in <b>type</b> <b>III</b> deficiency, the relationship between the plasma concentrations of β-chain containing isoforms of C 4 b-binding protein (C 4 BPβ+) and different forms of protein S (free, bound, and total) was evaluated in 327 members of 18 protein S-deficient families. In normal relatives (n = 190), protein S correlated well with C 4 BPβ+ with free protein S (96 ± 23 nmol/L) being equal to the molar excess of protein S (355 ± 65 nmol/L) over C 4 BPβ+ (275 ± 47 nmol/L). In protein S-deficient family members (n = 117), the equimolar relationship between protein S (215 ± 50 nmol/L) and C 4 BPβ+ (228 ± 51 nmol/L), together with the high affinity of the interaction, resulted in low levels of free protein S (16 ± 10 nmol/L). Free protein S levels were distinctly low in proteinS-deficient members, whereas in 47 of the protein S-deficient individuals, the concentration of total protein S was within the normal range, which fulfills the criteria for <b>type</b> <b>III</b> deficiency. The remaining 70 had low levels of both total and free protein S and, accordingly, would be type I deficient. Coexistence of type I and <b>type</b> <b>III</b> deficiency was found in 14 families, suggesting the two <b>types</b> of protein <b>S</b> deficiency to be phenotypic variants of the same genetic disease. Interestingly, not only protein S but also C 4 BPβ+ levels were decreased in orally anticoagulated controls and even more so in anticoagulated protein S- deficient members, suggesting that the concentration of C 4 BPβ+ is influenced by that of protein S. In conclusion, our results indicate that type I and <b>type</b> <b>III</b> deficiencies are phenotypic variants of the same genetic disease and that the low plasma concentrations of free protein <b>S</b> in both <b>types</b> are the result of an equimolar relationship between protein S and C 4 BPβ+...|$|R

De-repression is achieved by a multitude of mechanisms, many of which involve binding of a protein to DNA at the repressed promoter {{in a manner that}} compromises the maintenance of the H-NS-DNA nucleoprotein repression complex. The principal virulence gene promoters in Shigella flexneri, the cause of bacillary dysentery, are repressed by H-NS. VirB, a protein that closely resembles members of the ParB family of plasmid partitioning proteins, derepresses the operons that encode the main structural components and the effector proteins of the <b>S.</b> flexneri <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion system. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that VirB has been co-opted into its current role as an H-NS antagonist in S. flexneri. To test this hypothesis, the potential for VirB to act as a positive regulator of proU, an operon that is repressed by H-NS, was assessed. Although VirB has no known relationship with the osmo-regulated proU operon, it could relieve H-NS-mediated repression when the parS-like VirB binding site was placed appropriately upstream of the RpoD-dependent proU promoter.

Four high-density polyethylene tanks, 2 m in diameter by 2 m in height, were filled with and surrounded by waste rock (active zone lysimeters; AZLs) at the Diavik site to study the upper 2 m of the active zone within a waste-rock pile and to evaluate the quality of effluent released from waste rock with differing <b>S</b> contents (<b>Type</b> I AZLs: 0. 014 wt. % <b>S</b> and <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> AZLs: 0. 035 wt. % S). In addition, three waste-rock test piles also were constructed at Diavik, two uncovered test piles (Type I test pile: 0. 035 wt. % <b>S</b> and <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> test pile: 0. 053 wt. % S) and a third pile was constructed based on the mine-closure plan which consists of waste rock (Type III: 0. 082 wt. % S) capped with a 1. 5 m layer of till and a 3 m layer of Type I material (Covered test pile). Each test pile is underlain by a high-density polyethylene geomembrane that captures and directs water to outflow drains. Results show that the release and transport of blasting residuals {{could be used as}} a resident tracer, indicating the first flush of water through the AZLs and the test piles. Variations in concentrations of blasting residuals and the gradual rate of dissipation provide an indication of the heterogeneity of the distribution of blasting residuals and the relative contributions of water and solutes from different flow paths. As temperatures within the test piles increase in response to ambient air temperature increases, larger proportions of the test pile contributed to the outflow, and increased concentrations of blasting residuals were observed in waste-rock test pile effluent. Effluent from the Type I AZLs and test pile maintained near-neutral pH (ranged from 5. 8 to 8) with concentrations of SO₄²⁻ 1500 mg L⁻¹) suggesting sulfide oxidation was occurring. Maximum concentrations of SO₄²⁻, Al, Zn, Ni, Co, and Cu were observed in 2009 during the first flush of water through the <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> test pile. A sequence of acid-neutralization reactions was inferred based on the water chemistry of the effluent derived from the <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> AZLs and waste-rock test pile. This acid-neutralization sequence is similar to those observed at other AMD impacted sites. A series of mineral dissolution-precipitation reactions controlled pH and metal mobility; carbonate-mineral dissolution consumed H⁺ generated from sulfide-mineral oxidation at near neutral pH and the dissolution of Al and Fe (oxy) hydroxides consumed H⁺ at pH < 5. 0. The cover system on the Covered test pile dampened the effects of ambient air temperature on the internal temperatures within the core of the Covered test pile. As a result, the Covered test pile had a relatively steady change in flow rate, with decreased flow from June to August, which led to a slow but prolonged release of sulfide-mineral oxidation products, such as SO₄²⁻ and dissolved metals, including Ni, Co, Zn, Cd, and Cu, compared to the uncovered <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> test pile. The pH decreased in 2008 and remained low for the duration of the study, whereas the pH in the uncovered test pile was near-neutral at the beginning of each field season in May and decreased to < 4. 2 by the end of the field season in November. The microbiological-community profiles observed in the AZLs and waste-rock test piles suggest typical AMD-related species were present in acidic effluent with elevated concentrations of metals, whereas typical soil microbes were present in effluent with a near-neutral pH and lower concentrations of SO₄²⁻ and dissolved metals. The <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> AZLs, <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> test pile, and Covered test pile maintained populations of acidophilic Fe-oxidizers, whereas, the Type I AZLs and Type I test pile maintained populations of neutrophilic S-oxidizers. Laboratory humidity-cell (1 kg) results were scaled up to estimate the water quality from the <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> AZLs (6 t) using measured physical and chemical parameters. The results suggested over-prediction of SO₄²⁻ and metal concentrations when low mean annual precipitation occurred, limiting flushing of predicted oxidation products. In subsequent years with higher mean annual precipitation oxidation products from previous years were liberated and resulted in the under prediction of SO₄²⁻ and metal concentrations. Additionally, Fe and Al were over-predicted because Fe and Al concentrations in the AZL effluent may be controlled by the solubility and formation of secondary minerals, such as Fe oxyhydroxides, jarosite, and goethite, which were not included in the scaling procedure...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the characterization of}} Swedish families with inherited resistance to activated protein C (APC resistance) and/or protein S deficiency, two genetic disorders associated with functional impairment of the protein C anticoagulant pathway. The APC resistance phenotype {{was linked to the}} factor V gene locus in a kindred with independent inheritance of APC resistance and protein S deficiency. A point mutation changing Arg 506 to a Gln (FV:Q 506) in the factor V gene was the cause of APC resistance. In studies of 50 families with hereditary APC resistance, the FV:Q 506 mutation was identified in 94 % (47 / 50) of the families, and the thrombotic risk was found to be dependent on the factor V genotype. Moreover, 18 families with hereditary deficiency of free protein <b>S</b> were investigated. <b>Type</b> I protein <b>S</b> deficiency (low free and total protein <b>S)</b> and <b>type</b> <b>III</b> deficiency (low free but normal total protein S) coexisted in 78 % (14 / 18) of the families, suggesting the two types to be phenotypic variants of the same genetic disorder. Deficiency of free protein S was caused by equimolar relationship between protein S and beta-chain containing isoforms of C 4 BP. Though protein S deficiency was a strong risk factor for thrombosis, the FV:Q 506 mutation was identified as an additional genetic risk factor in 39 % of the families. Thus, familial thrombophilia is a multiple gene disorder. The thrombophilic tendency associated with APC resistance or protein S deficiency was related to increased levels of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, reflecting increased activation of the common coagulation pathway...|$|R
40|$|Freshly {{isolated}} virulent and nonvirulent {{strains of}} Streptococcus agalactiae <b>type</b> <b>III</b> {{were used to}} study differences in coccal adherence to synchronously dividing, subconfluent human embryonic amnion and fetal lung monolayers in vitro. The adherence frequency by virulent isolates of mid-logarithmically growing cocci to amnion cells varied markedly with host cell age, being highest shortly after eucaryotic cell division. This variation was not observed with lung cell monolayers, suggesting that cyclic production or exposure of coccal receptor sites on the eucaryotic cell surface with age is not a common property of all primary human cells in vitro. However, and regardless of age, not all cells within these synchronously dividing populations bound virulent cocci, indicating that a very small segment of a population may always be unresponsive to host cell interactions with a coccal pathogen. By comparison, adherence of nonvirulent coccal isolates to amnion and lung cells remained constant and of a very low order, regardless of host cell age. Maximal adherence of virulent S. agalactiae to young host cells occurred at early and mid-logarithmic phases of growth. However, at the late stationary growth phase, adherence was reduced to almost that of nonvirulent isolates. Pretreatment of virulent S. agalactiae with anti-lipoteichoic acid (LTA) serum failed to inhibit coccal adherence to these different host cells. Heat negated adherence. Group B coccal LTA was cytotoxic for these host cells. However, pretreatment of amnion and lung cells with nontoxic levels of this amphiphile did not prevent attachment of virulent cocci. Finally, coccal pretreatment with pronase abrogated adherence to either host cell even though surface-exposed LTA was uneffected, as observed by the indirect fluorescent-antibody procedure. Likewise, no observable difference in surface LTA was detected when fresh isolates of virulent and nonvirulent coccal strains were compared by this procedure. These studies suggest that protein involvement, rather than LTA, is primarily responsible for mediating virulent <b>S.</b> agalactiae <b>type</b> <b>III</b> attachment to these synchronously growing, subconfluent eucaryotic monolayers in vitro...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a paucity of data on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus sciuri (MRSS) {{epidemiology}} in European healthcare settings. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the prevalence of nasal and pharyngeal carriage and diversity of MRSS among inpatients and healthcare workers (HCWs) in the largest healthcare centre in Serbia, and to assess performance of different methods for MRSS screening. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs were obtained from 195 patients and 105 HCWs in different departments. Each swab was inoculated directly onto MRSA-ID, oxacillin-resistance screening agar and mannitol salt agar (MSA) with 2 mg/L of oxacillin. After inoculation, each swab was dipped in Mueller-Hinton broth with 6. 5 % NaCl and after overnight incubation, subcultured onto oxacillin-MSA. Characterisation of isolated MRSS strains was determined by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PFGE, SCCmec typing and antimicrobial resistance genes detection. MRSS nasal and pharyngeal carriage rate was high (5 %) in our hospital and department-variable. PFGE revealed a possible cross-transmission of MRSS between a patient and an HCW, and dissemination across hospital wards. All analysed isolates were multidrug resistant. Fusidic acid resistance was discovered in 93. 7 % of isolates, but fusA mutations in EF-G and fusB/C genes were not detected. SCCmec regions of MRSS contained elements of classic methicillin-resistant <b>S.</b> aureus <b>type</b> <b>III.</b> Broth enrichment prior to isolation on oxacillin-MSA was superior to direct cultivation on different media with a sensitivity/specificity of 100 % and 88. 5 %, respectively.

40|$|<b>Type</b> <b>III</b> {{secretion}} system (T 3 SS) plays {{important roles}} in bacteria and host cell interactions by specifically translocating <b>type</b> <b>III</b> effectors into the cytoplasm of the host cells. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the bacterial <b>type</b> <b>III</b> effectors determine their specific secretion via <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion conduits. It is still unclear {{as to how the}} N-terminal sequences guide this specificity. In this work, the amino acid composition, secondary structure, and solvent accessibility in the N-termini of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> and non-type III secreted proteins were compared and contrasted. A high-efficacy mathematical model based on these joint features was developed to distinguish the <b>type</b> <b>III</b> proteins from the non-type III ones. The results indicate that secondary structure and solvent accessibility may make important contribution to the specific recognition of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion signals. Analysis also showed that the joint feature of the N-terminal 6 (th) - 10 (th) amino acids are especially important for guiding specific <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion. Furthermore, a genome-wide screening was performed to predict Salmonella <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secreted proteins, and 8 new candidates were experimentally validated. Interestingly, <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion signals were also predicted in gram-positive bacteria and yeasts.

This research provides the first line of direct evidence that secondary structure and solvent accessibility contain important features for guiding specific <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion. The new software based on these joint features ensures a high accuracy (general cross-validation sensitivity of ∼ 96 % at a specificity of ∼ 98 %) in silico identification of new <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secreted proteins, which may facilitate our understanding about the specificity of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion and the evolution of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secreted proteins...|$|R

40|$|<b>Type</b> <b>III</b> {{secretion}} {{systems are}} toxin delivery {{systems that are}} present in {{a large number of}} pathogens. A hallmark of all <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion systems studied to date is that expression of one or more of their components is induced upon cell contact. It has been proposed that this induction is controlled by a negative regulator that is itself secreted by means of the <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion machinery. Although candidate proteins for this negative regulator have been proposed in a number of systems, for the most part, a direct demonstration of their role in regulation is lacking. Here, we report the discovery of ExsE, a negative regulator of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion gene expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Deletion of exsE deregulates expression of the <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion genes.
