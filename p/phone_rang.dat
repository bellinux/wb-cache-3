5|$|At {{approximately}} 8:00pm on 19 December 2010, Reardon {{returned home}} from a weekend visit to Sheffield to find Yeates absent from their flat on Canynge Road, Clifton. Reardon {{had been trying to}} contact her by phone and text, but without success. While awaiting Yeates' return, Reardon called her again, but her mobile <b>phone</b> <b>rang</b> from a pocket of her coat, which was still in the flat. He found that her purse and keys were also at the flat, and that their cat appeared to have been neglected. Shortly after half past midnight, Reardon contacted the police and Yeates' parents to report her missing.|$|E
25|$|During 1986 {{the series}} became {{dominated}} by Den and Angie's storylines {{and the focus}} of the programme was very much concentrated on their combustible relationship. The emphasis began early in 1986 with the arrival of Den's mistress Jan Hammond (Jane How). Jan had been a powerful off-screen presence for the first year, a menacing voice {{at the end of the}} telephone, which severely affected the mood of both Den and Angie and kept the audience on edge every time the <b>phone</b> <b>rang.</b> Jan's physical arrival at the Vic in January 1986 was one of the show's dramatic highlights. Her invasion of Angie's territory was a springboard to future emotional fireworks and a precursor to Angie's further dependence on alcohol and her attempted suicide.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time Big Brother Australia {{featured}} a telephone in the house. It was situated in the lounge and was shown on the Opening Night broadcast before the housemates entered the house. On Day 37, Big Brother informed housemates that if the <b>phone</b> <b>rang</b> only one housemate could answer it. Joel was nominated to answer it on the housemates' behalf. On Day 52 Joel {{received a call from}} Big Brother advising that he would be away from the house and would communicate via the phone to Joel at various times. On Day 58 Andrew picked up the phone as a joke, and was penalised by being sent to the Punishment Room to polish boots. Michelle joined him in the Punishment Room due to the weekly task which involved housemates remaining partnered.|$|E

For example, if a person were to state [...] "When the <b>phone</b> <b>rings</b> I get happy" [...] and then later state [...] "When the <b>phone</b> <b>rings</b> I get annoyed", the logical inference which is made from this contradictory information is that the person is making a false statement about the <b>phone</b> <b>ringing.</b>|$|R

Loup had shown a strong {{performance}} when he was playing for the Tulane Green Wave and was the second Green Wave player to be drafted. Loup said of the event, [...] "I had 20 people text message me before I even heard anything and then my <b>phone</b> <b>rang</b> and I got the call. It's exciting. They told me they would call {{me as soon as}} the draft was over and we would discuss details, so hopefully everything will shake out." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the end of}} the 2009–10 season, Brad Stevens and Butler {{continued}} to attract considerable attention. President Barack Obama personally called Stevens to congratulate him on Butler's season. David Letterman had Stevens on his show for a guest appearance. Butler admissions inquiries shot up 67%. Stevens received fan letters from around the world, and his <b>phone</b> <b>rang</b> off the hook. He was invited to throw the ceremonial first pitch before the Chicago Cubs vs. Florida Marlins game in Chicago on May 10. [...] "It's all been very surreal," [...] Stevens said. [...] "If you are the runner-up, you don't expect to talk to the president." [...] "It's been a little overwhelming, because I'm a pretty simple guy," [...] he added.|$|E
500|$|She entered The Factory with Warhol, who complimented {{her on her}} {{appearance}} as she was uncharacteristically wearing makeup. Morrissey told her to leave, threatening to [...] "beat the hell" [...] out of her and throw her out otherwise. The <b>phone</b> <b>rang</b> and Warhol answered while Morrissey went to the bathroom. While Warhol was on the phone, Solanas fired at him three times. Her first two shots missed, but the third went through both lungs, his spleen, stomach, liver, and esophagus. She then shot art critic Mario Amaya in the hip. She tried to shoot Fred Hughes, Warhol's manager, in the head but her gun jammed. Hughes asked her to leave, which she did, leaving behind a paper bag with her address book on a table. Warhol was taken to Columbus–Mother Cabrini Hospital, where he underwent a five-hour, successful operation.|$|E

500|$|The first Beach Boy to hear [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] in a semi-completed {{form was}} Carl Wilson, who had {{previously}} participated in rough guide vocals with Brian for the initial February mix. Following a performance with the touring group in North Dakota, he remembered: [...] "I came back up into my hotel room one night and the <b>phone</b> <b>rang.</b> It was Brian on the other end. He called me from the recording studio and played this really bizarre sounding music over the phone. There were drums smashing, that kind of stuff, and then it refined itself {{and got into the}} cello. It was a real funky track." [...] In 1976, Brian revealed that before the final mixdown, he had been confronted with resistance by members of the group, whom Brian declined to name. The subject of their worries and complaints was the song's length and [...] "modern" [...] sound: [...] "I said no, it's not going to be too long a record, it's going to be just right. ... They didn't quite understand what this jumping from studio to studio was all about. And they couldn't conceive of the record as I did. I saw the record as a totality piece." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 4, 2010, Pombo {{announced}} his candidacy for Congress in California's 19th congressional district after Congressman George Radanovich, a fellow Republican, announced he wouldn't run for reelection. The 19th neighbors Pombo's former 11th district and leans more Republican than the 11th. Pombo said he [...] "didn't think [...] would ever run again, but when George Radanovich announced he wasn't running, my <b>phone</b> <b>rang</b> off the hook". Pombo faced Radanovich-backed state Senator Jeff Denham and former Fresno mayor Jim Patterson in the primary, which Jeff Denham won.|$|E
2500|$|Boy was {{recorded}} at Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin from July to September 1980. Lillywhite had first come to prominence {{for his work}} on the 1978's debut single of Siouxsie and the Banshees, [...] "Hong Kong Garden" [...] which featured a peculiar hook played by a glockenspiel. U2, who listened to Siouxsie and the Banshees, used Lillywhite's skills to add the distinctive glockenspiel part on [...] "I Will Follow". The drums were recorded in the stairwell of the studio's reception area due to Lillywhite's desire to achieve [...] "this wonderful clattery sound". They had to wait until the receptionist went home in the evenings as the <b>phone</b> <b>rang</b> through the day and even occasionally in the evening.|$|E

2500|$|Originally, Hadfield was {{to record}} a video which would be {{broadcast}} during the unveiling ceremony, but on 7 March 2013, the plan was changed because an executive at the Bank of Canada wanted a live event. By 12 March, the new plan was in place. The plan was scripted to include press conference speeches by Jim Flaherty and Mark Carney, the latter {{of which would be}} interrupted by a phone call revealed to be from Hadfield. Contingency plans were created in case a communications link to the ISS could not be established (the [...] "green script"), or if it was interrupted or failed at any point (the [...] "blue script"). These were unnecessary, but Flaherty finished his speech early and requested the media to wait because [...] "something is supposed to happen", saying [...] "Hallelujah" [...] when the <b>phone</b> <b>rang.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Leanne Tiernan [...] (27 September 1984 – 26 November 2000), a pupil at West Leeds High School, {{was last}} seen alive at 4.50pm on 26 November 2000 {{when she and her}} friend, 15-year-old Sarah Whitehouse, {{returned}} to Bramley by bus after a shopping trip to Leeds city centre. The [...] girls parted company at Houghley Lane, and Whitehouse last saw her setting off along an unlit path through an area of wooded wasteland known as Houghley Gill. When Whitehouse arrived home, she telephoned Tiernan's home and was surprised to find she was not there. At 5.20pm Tiernan's mother rang her mobile phone to find out where she was, but the <b>phone</b> <b>rang</b> out for some time and then cut off. When she rang it again, it was cut off after four rings. At 7.00pm she rang the police and reported her daughter as a missing person.|$|E
2500|$|DeVille {{recorded}} Miracle in London with Mark Knopfler {{serving as}} his sideman and producer. He said, [...] "It was Mark (Knopfler’s) wife Lourdes {{who came up}} with the idea (to record Miracle). She said to him that you don't sing like Willy and he doesn't play guitar like you, but you really like his stuff so why don't you do an album together?" [...] "Storybook Love", a song from Miracle and the theme song of the movie The Princess Bride, was nominated for an Academy Award in 1987; DeVille performed the song at that year's Academy Awards telecast.Knopfler heard ("Storybook Love") and asked if I knew about this movie he was doing. It was a Rob Reiner film about a princess and a prince. The song was about the same subject matter as the film, so we submitted it to Reiner and he loved it. About six or seven months later, I was half asleep when the <b>phone</b> <b>rang.</b> It was the Academy of Arts and Sciences with the whole spiel. I hung up on them! They called back and Lisa (his wife) answered the phone. She came in to tell me that I was nominated for [...] "Storybook Love." [...] It's pretty wild. It's not the Grammys — it's the Academy Awards, which is different for a musician. Before I knew it, I was performing on the awards show with Little Richard. It was the year of Dirty Dancing, and they won.|$|E

Dobson had been opposed to the suicide storyline from the beginning, she fought hard to get the scripts changed but she was eventually persuaded to play the scenes and was applauded for a [...] "brilliant performance". However Angie's suicide attempt provoked a massive reaction, not all of it favourable. There was a public outcry about the last two shots of the suicide episode, and Julia Smith subsequently had to cut one of them for the omnibus edition. Some accused the programme of sensationalising suicide and giving ideas to copy-cats. The buildup to Angie's desperate action and its sickening aftermath were intended to demonstrate the full despair of her situation and Holland and Smith have maintained that the horror of its on-screen depiction was meant to deter, not encourage, the act.|$|E
2500|$|After {{hiding out}} {{for nearly a}} week, Duane Peak was arrested for the crime on August 28. [...] In his first {{statement}} to police, without having consulted an attorney, Peak {{said that there was}} an envelope for him at NCCF headquarters on Sunday, August 16. Inside, a note told him to go in back of the Lothrop Drug store and pick up a suitcase, which he did before 5 p.m. He was instructed to take the suitcase to an address near 28th and Ohio at 11 p.m. that night and leave it on the field side of a fence. The note told him to go to a particular payphone before 2 a.m. and wait for a phone call. The <b>phone</b> <b>rang</b> and a woman's voice told him to call 911 and report a woman dragged into 2867 Ohio. The police report indicates that he admitted to placing the 911 call. Peak implicated neither Rice nor Poindexter in his first statement. [...] There are no police reports for August 29 or August 30, so it is unknown who talked to him over the weekend, though in his February 4, 1971 deposition, Peak said that Lt. James Perry interrogated him several times over that weekend. On Monday, August 31, Peak told the County Attorney Art O'Leary in a deposition, that Poindexter had made the bomb at Rice's house, told him to plant it, and then lure the police to the vacant house with an anonymous 911 call. (Peak allegedly carried a suitcase bomb with a clothespin triggering device into three vehicles and to two different residences from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. that day, at one point putting it in the trunk of a car because there were seven passengers in the car including his two small nieces.) ATF Agent Tom Sledge, brother of the Omaha police officer assigned to the call, was present during Peak's deposition, as were two Omaha Police officers, Bill Coleman and Pitmon Foxall and Peak's attorney, Tom Carey, although Peak had to ask the County Attorney who Carey was.|$|E
