5|$|Although {{repeated}} theft can be <b>punishable</b> by amputation of {{the right}} hand and aggravated theft by the cross-amputation of a hand and a foot, only one instance of judicial amputation was reported between 2007 and 2010. Homosexual acts are <b>punishable</b> by flogging, imprisonment or death. Lashings are a common form of punishment and are often imposed for offences against religion and public morality such as drinking alcohol and neglect of prayer and fasting obligations.|$|E
5|$|Being {{in prison}} in any country for an offence <b>punishable</b> with {{imprisonment}} for at least 12 months, being under sentence of death, or having been accused or convicted of an offence <b>punishable</b> with at least 12 months' imprisonment and having a warrant of arrest relating to the offence in force.|$|E

5|$|Female {{homosexuality}} has {{not received}} the same negative response from religious or criminal authorities as male homosexuality or adultery has throughout history. Whereas sodomy between men, men and women, and men and animals was <b>punishable</b> by death in Britain, acknowledgment of sexual contact between women was nonexistent in medical and legal texts. The earliest law against female homosexuality appeared in France in 1270. In Spain, Italy, and the Holy Roman Empire, sodomy between women was included in acts considered unnatural and <b>punishable</b> by burning to death, although few instances are recorded of this taking place.|$|E
5|$|Penalty kick: {{awarded to}} the fouled team {{following}} a foul usually <b>punishable</b> by a direct free kick but that has occurred within their opponent's penalty area.|$|E
5|$|Abolition of untouchability: Article 17 of the {{constitution}} abolishes the practice of untouchability. Practice of untouchability is an offence and anyone doing so is <b>punishable</b> by law. The Untouchability Offences Act of 1955 (renamed to Protection of Civil Rights Act in 1976) provided penalties for preventing a person from entering a place of worship or from taking water from a tank or well.|$|E
5|$|As Warden, and {{afterwards}} Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20 {{percent of the}} coins taken in during the Great Recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit. Counterfeiting was high treason, <b>punishable</b> by the felon being hanged, drawn and quartered. Despite this, convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult. However, Newton proved equal to the task.|$|E
5|$|In 1762, George III {{acquired}} Buckingham House {{and it was}} enlarged {{over the}} next 75 years. During the 18th century, London was dogged by crime, and the Bow Street Runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force. In total, more than 200 offences were <b>punishable</b> by death, including petty theft. Most children born in the city died before reaching their third birthday.|$|E
5|$|Rules of the NHL, the North American junior leagues, {{and other}} North American {{professional}} minor leagues punish fighting with a five-minute major penalty. What separates these leagues from other major North American sports leagues {{is that they}} do not eject players simply for participating in a fight. However, fighting is frequently <b>punishable</b> by ejection in European leagues, and in Olympic competition.|$|E
5|$|Suicide is a {{significant}} non-medical {{cause of death in}} Singapore. Although attempted suicide is an offence <b>punishable</b> with jail under section 309 of the Penal Code, Singapore still sees many cases of suicide each year. Between 2000 and 2004, 1,700 people killed themselves, and in 2007 suicides amounted to about 2.2% of all deaths. For every successful suicide attempt, there were seven unsuccessful ones.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court's {{decision}} did {{not specifically}} address {{the constitutionality of}} the older portion of the statute which prohibits the unauthorized wearing, manufacturing, or sale of military medals or decorations. Under the law, the unauthorized wearing, manufacturing, or sale of the Medal of Honor is <b>punishable</b> by a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment of up to one year.|$|E
5|$|The appellants were Jehovah's Witnesses. On 2 July 1992, police seized {{publications}} from them, thirteen {{of which}} turned out to be publications prohibited under Order 123. The appellants were charged under Order 123 for possession of publications by the WTBTS, an offence <b>punishable</b> under section 4(2) of the UPA.|$|E
5|$|Display and {{usage of}} the flag is governed by the Flag Code of India, 2002 (successor to the Flag Code– India, the {{original}} flag code); the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950; and the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. Insults to the national flag, including gross affronts or indignities to it, as well as using it in a manner so as to violate {{the provisions of the}} Flag Code, are <b>punishable</b> by law with imprisonment up to three years, or a fine, or both.|$|E
5|$|Domitian also heavily prosecuted {{corruption}} among public officials, removing jurors if {{they accepted}} bribes and rescinding legislation when {{a conflict of}} interest was suspected. He ensured that libellous writings, especially those directed against himself, were <b>punishable</b> by exile or death. Actors were likewise regarded with suspicion, as their performances provided an opportunity for satire {{at the expense of the}} government. Consequently, he forbade mimes from appearing on stage in public.|$|E
5|$|During the regency, he and {{his mother}} {{abolished}} the Va'a Tai 'Aru, the law, enacted by his father, which had made crimes such as murder, treason and adultery <b>punishable</b> by death. Instead, criminals were exiled to small island of Îles Maria. Teuruarii and his mother also presided over the opening of the Protestant church of Moerai. The construction of the church had been begun by his father and the work was completed by a foreign carpenter named Quittaine Chapman.|$|E
5|$|Exportation of merinos without royal {{permission}} {{was also}} a <b>punishable</b> offense, thus ensuring a near-absolute monopoly on the breed until the mid-18th century. After {{the breaking of the}} export ban, fine wool sheep began to be distributed worldwide. The export to Rambouillet by Louis XVI in 1786 formed the basis for the modern Rambouillet (or French Merino) breed. After the Napoleonic Wars and the global distribution of the once-exclusive Spanish stocks of Merinos, sheep raising in Spain reverted to hardy coarse-wooled breeds such as the Churra, and was no longer of international economic significance.|$|E
5|$|Flogging was {{discontinued}} in the 1940s, {{with the}} last incident occurring in 1943. From that decade, punishments were decided by the superintendent after hearing the case against a prisoner, or by a magistrate for grievous violations. Lesser transgressions could result in solitary confinement, or restriction from visitors, education, and concerts; serious offences were <b>punishable</b> by the cancellation of any remission earned and a bread-and-water diet, normally over a two-week period.|$|E
5|$|In case any of {{this should}} be resisted, Parliament passed the Treasons Act 1534, which made it high treason <b>punishable</b> by death to deny Royal Supremacy. The {{following}} year, Thomas More and John Fisher were executed under this legislation. Finally, in 1536, Parliament passed the Act against the Pope's Authority, which removed {{the last part of}} papal authority still legal. This was Rome's power in England to decide disputes concerning Scripture.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines {{starting}} on the goal line 16.5m (18yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5m (18yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them. This area {{has a number of}} functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul {{by a member of the}} defending team becomes <b>punishable</b> by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, H.non-scripta is a {{protected}} species under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Landowners {{are prohibited from}} removing common bluebells on their land for sale {{and it is a}} criminal offence to remove the bulbs of wild common bluebells. This legislation was strengthened in 1998 under Schedule 8 of the Act making any trade in wild common bluebell bulbs or seeds an offence, <b>punishable</b> by fines of up to £5,000 per bulb. The species is not protected in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{obtained}} IRO {{membership in}} secrecy: the initiation ritual involved a formal {{oath of allegiance}} over the Gospel or a Christian cross, a gun and a knife; treason was <b>punishable</b> by death, and secret police monitored each member's activities. Through clandestine channels of reliable people, relations were maintained with the revolutionary diasporic community. The internal correspondence employed encryption, conventional signs, and fake personal and committee names. Although Levski himself headed the organisation, he shared administrative responsibilities with assistants such as monk-turned-revolutionary Matey Preobrazhenski, the adventurous Dimitar Obshti, and the young Angel Kanchev.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people in}} China {{and other parts}} of Asia have a belief that various tiger parts have {{medicinal}} properties, including as pain killers and aphrodisiacs. There is no scientific evidence to support these beliefs. The use of tiger parts in pharmaceutical drugs in China is already banned, and the government has made some offences in connection with tiger poaching <b>punishable</b> by death. Furthermore, all trade in tiger parts is illegal under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and a domestic trade ban has been in place in China since 1993.|$|E
5|$|On May 6, under {{pressure}} from Willamette Week, Goldschmidt publicly {{announced that he had}} engaged in a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl (the victim later indicated she was 13) for an extended period during his first term as Mayor of Portland. Sex with a person under 16 years of age constitutes third degree rape under Oregon law, a felony <b>punishable</b> by up to five years in prison. By the time the relationship had become public, however, the statute of limitations had expired, making Goldschmidt immune from any prosecution over the matter.|$|E
5|$|Republikflucht {{became a}} crime in 1957, <b>punishable</b> by heavy fines and up to three years' imprisonment. Any act {{associated}} with an escape attempt– including helping an escapee– was subject to this legislation. Those {{caught in the act}} were often tried for espionage as well and given proportionately harsher sentences. More than 75,000people– an average of more than seven people a day– were imprisoned for attempting to escape across the border, serving an average of one to two years' imprisonment. Border guards who attempted to escape were treated much more harshly and were on average imprisoned for five years.|$|E
5|$|Section 4 of the 1971 Act {{sets out}} that {{offences}} under sections 1(2) and 1(3) are <b>punishable</b> by a maximum {{term of life}} imprisonment and all others by a maximum of ten years' imprisonment. Section 30 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 sets out a higher maximum of 14 years' imprisonment for racially or religiously aggravated offences other than those already carrying a maximum of life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Slaves in Toraja society were family property. Sometimes Torajans {{decided to}} become slaves when they {{incurred}} a debt, pledging to work as payment. Slaves could be taken during wars, and slave trading was common. Slaves could buy their freedom, but their children still inherited slave status. Slaves were prohibited from wearing bronze or gold, carving their houses, eating from the same dishes as their owners, or having sex with free women—a crime <b>punishable</b> by death.|$|E
5|$|The play, set in Verona, Italy, {{begins with}} a street brawl between Montague and Capulet {{servants}} who, like their masters, are sworn enemies. Prince Escalus of Verona intervenes and declares that further breach of the peace will be <b>punishable</b> by death. Later, Count Paris talks to Capulet about marrying his daughter Juliet, but Capulet asks Paris to wait another two years and invites him to attend a planned Capulet ball. Lady Capulet and Juliet's nurse try to persuade Juliet to accept Paris's courtship.|$|E
5|$|The sheep {{industry}} in Spain was {{an instance of}} migratory flock management, with large homogenous flocks ranging over the entire country. The management model used in England was quite different but had a similar importance to economy of the country. Up until the early 20th century, owling (the smuggling of sheep or wool out of the country) was a <b>punishable</b> offense, {{and to this day}} the Lord Speaker of the House of Lords sits on a cushion known as the Woolsack.|$|E
5|$|A person {{inside or}} outside a {{security}} area who knows or has reasonable cause to believe that another person has committed an offence under Part III of the ISA, or has information about the present or intended movements or whereabouts of another person whom he or she knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be a terrorist, but who fails to report the matter to a police officer, commits an offence <b>punishable</b> by imprisonment for up to ten years. However, if the person voluntarily gives full information to a police officer before being accused of or charged with an offence, {{he or she will}} not be convicted.|$|E
5|$|Constable Hanks {{reported}} {{the matter to}} his superiors and the case was given to Detective Inspector Frederick Abberline. Inspector Abberline went to the brothel on 6 July with a warrant to arrest Hammond and Newlove for violation of Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. The Act made all homosexual acts between men, as well as procurement or attempted procurement of such acts, <b>punishable</b> by up to two years' imprisonment with or without hard labour. He found the house locked and Hammond gone, but Abberline was able to apprehend Newlove at his mother's house in Camden Town. In the time between his statement to Hanks and his arrest, Newlove had gone to Cleveland Street and warned Hammond, who had consequently escaped to his brother's house in Gravesend.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{projects}} such as these constituted only the most visible part of Domitian's religious policy, which also concerned itself with the fulfilment of religious law and public morals. In 85, he nominated himself perpetual censor, the office that held the task of supervising Roman morals and conduct. Once again, Domitian acquitted himself of this task dutifully, and with care. He renewed the Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis, under which adultery was <b>punishable</b> by exile. From the list of jurors he struck an equestrian who had divorced his wife and taken her back, while an ex-quaestor was expelled from the Senate for acting and dancing.|$|E
5|$|During the Japanese {{occupation}} of Hong Kong, the Japanese army committed atrocities against civilians and POWs, {{such as the}} St. Stephen's College massacre. Local residents also suffered widespread food shortages, limited rationing and hyper-inflation arising from the forced exchange of currency from Hong Kong dollars to Japanese military banknotes. The initial ratio of 2:1 was gradually devalued to 4:1 and ownership of Hong Kong dollars was declared illegal and <b>punishable</b> by harsh torture. Due to starvation and forced deportation for slave labour to mainland China, the population of Hong Kong had dwindled from 1.6 million in 1941 to 600,000 in 1945, when the United Kingdom resumed control of the colony on 2 September 1945.|$|E
5|$|Federal law {{states that}} {{national}} parks {{will have the}} same underage laws as the state that they are located in, and the Assimilative Crimes Act is applicable to New Jersey's underage drinking statute. Thus, in a private location, such as a cabin in a federal enclave in New Jersey, a parent can serve alcohol to their child, and an underage person can possess and consume alcohol. Outside of these exceptions, underage drinking and serving alcohol to a minor are federal misdemeanors, <b>punishable</b> by a fine and up to 6 months in jail. There is a five-year statute of limitations for DUI, underage drinking, and other alcohol violations that take place in federal enclaves.|$|E
5|$|In Gortyn, in Crete, {{according}} to a code engraved in stone dating to the 6th century BC, slaves (doulos or oikeus) {{found themselves in a}} state of great dependence. Their children belonged to the master. The master was responsible for all their offences, and, inversely, he received amends for crimes committed against his slaves by others. In the Gortyn code, where all punishment was monetary, fines were doubled for slaves committing a misdemeanour or felony. Conversely, an offence committed against a slave was much less expensive than an offence committed against a free person. As an example, the rape of a free woman by a slave was <b>punishable</b> by a fine of 200 staters (400 drachms), while the rape of a non-virgin slave by another slave brought a fine of only one obolus (a sixth of a drachm).|$|E
