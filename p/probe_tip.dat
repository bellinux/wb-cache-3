5|$|A {{new method}} to study lipid bilayers is Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM). Rather than using {{a beam of}} light or particles, a very small sharpened tip scans the surface by making physical contact with the bilayer and moving across it, like a record player needle. AFM is a promising technique because {{it has the potential to}} image with nanometer resolution at room temperature and even under water or physiological buffer, conditions necessary for natural bilayer behavior. Utilizing this capability, AFM has been used to examine dynamic bilayer behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores (holes) and phase transitions in supported bilayers. Another advantage is that AFM does not require fluorescent or isotopic labeling of the lipids, since the <b>probe</b> <b>tip</b> interacts mechanically with the bilayer surface. Because of this, the same scan can image both lipids and associated proteins, sometimes even with single-molecule resolution. AFM can also probe the mechanical nature of lipid bilayers.|$|E

Examples of {{scanning}} probe microscopes are the {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM), the Scanning tunneling microscope, the photonic force microscope and the recurrence tracking microscope.

There are also probes that contain switches to select 10:1 or direct (1:1) ratios, but one must be aware that the 1:1 setting has significant capacitance (tens of pF) at the <b>probe</b> <b>tip,</b> because the whole cable's capacitance is now directly connected.|$|E

He also discovered atomic hydrogen, which he put to use by inventing the atomic hydrogen welding process; the first plasma weld ever made.

25|$|A probe {{is placed}} {{through the skin}} and into the tumor using {{real-time}} imaging of both the <b>probe</b> <b>tip</b> and the tumor by computed tomography, ultrasound, or even magnetic resonance imaging guidance, and then destroying the tumor with heat (radiofrequency ablation) or cold (cryotherapy). These modalities are at a disadvantage compared to traditional surgery in that pathologic confirmation of complete tumor destruction is not possible. Therefore, long-term follow-up is crucial to assess completeness of tumour ablation. Ideally, percutaneous ablation is restricted to tumours smaller than 3.5nbsp&cm and to guide the treatment. However, there are some cases where ablation {{can be used on}} tumors that are larger.|$|E
500|$|The probe is {{connected}} to a detector and a display meter (not shown in figure 2). [...] These can be, respectively, a thermistor and power meter, or an envelope detector and VSWR meter. [...] The detector can be a crystal detector or a Schottky barrier diode. [...] The detector is mounted on the probe assembly, usually a distance λ/4 from the <b>probe</b> <b>tip</b> {{as shown in figure}} 3. [...] This is because the detector looks almost like a short circuit to the transmission line, and this distance will convert it to an open circuit through the quarter-wave impedance transformer effect. [...] Thus, the detector has minimal effect on loading the line. [...] The probe tuning stub can be seen on figure 3 branching from the line linking the probe to the detector. [...] Figure 2 has a slightly different arrangement; the main probe into the waveguide leads to a vertical co-axial tuning and adjustment section but the detector is on a horizontal side-section with a secondary probe into the upright co-axial section.|$|E

At the oscilloscope end is {{a box with}} several waveform-trimming adjustments. For safety, a barrier disc keeps one's fingers distant from the point being examined. Maximum voltage is in the low tens of kV. (Observing a high voltage ramp can create a staircase waveform with steps at different points every repetition, until the <b>probe</b> <b>tip</b> is in contact.

2500|$|Most {{oscilloscopes}} {{allow for}} probe attenuation factors, displaying the effective sensitivity at the <b>probe</b> <b>tip.</b> Historically, some auto-sensing circuitry used indicator lamps behind translucent {{windows in the}} panel to illuminate {{different parts of the}} sensitivity scale. To do so, the probe connectors (modified BNCs) had an extra contact to define the probe's attenuation. (A certain value of resistor, connected to ground, [...] "encodes" [...] the attenuation.) Because probes wear out, and because the auto-sensing circuitry is not compatible between different makes of oscilloscope, auto-sensing probe scaling is not foolproof. Likewise, manually setting the probe attenuation is prone to user error and it is a common mistake to have the probe scaling set incorrectly; resultant voltage readings can then be wrong by a factor of 10.|$|E

The pilot of the receiver aircraft extends his probe (if required) and uses normal flight controls to [...] "fly" [...] the refueling probe directly into the basket. [...] This requires a closure rate of approximately two knots (walking speed) {{in order to establish}} solid probe/drogue coupling and push the hose several feet into the HDU. [...] Too little closure will cause an incomplete connection and no fuel flow (or occasionally leaking fuel). Too much closure is dangerous because it can trigger a strong transverse oscillation in the hose, severing the <b>probe</b> <b>tip.</b> Another significant danger is that the drogue may hit the recipient aircraft and damage it—instances have occurred in which the drogue has shattered the canopy of a fighter aircraft, causing great danger to its pilot.|$|E

2500|$|The frit FAB and {{continuous}} flow-FAB (CF-FAB) interfaces {{were developed in}} 1985 and 1986 respectively. Both interfaces were similar, but they differed in that the first used a porous frit probe as connecting channel, while CF-FAB used a <b>probe</b> <b>tip.</b> From these, the CF-FAB was more successful as a [...] LC-MS interface and was useful to analyze non-volatile and thermally labile compounds. In these interfaces, the LC effluent passed through the frit or CF-FAB channels to form a uniform liquid film at the tip. There, the liquid was bombarded with ion beams or high energy atoms (fast atom). For stable operation, the FAB based interfaces were able to handle liquid flow rates of only 1-15 μl and were also restricted to microbore and capillary columns. In order {{to be used in}} FAB MS ionization sources, the analytes of interest should be mixed with a matrix (e.g., glycerol) that could be added before or after the separation in the LC column. FAB based interfaces were extensively used to characterize peptides, but lost applicability with the advent of electrospray based interfaces in 1988.|$|E

Conductive AFM provides pico-amp resolution to identify and localize electrical failures such as shorts, opens, resistive contacts and leakage paths, enabling accurate probe positioning for current-voltage measurements. AFM based nanoprobers enable nanometer scale device defect localization and accurate transistor device characterization without the physical damage and electrical bias induced by high energy electron beam exposure.For SEM based nanoprobers, the ultra-high resolution of the microscopes that house the nanoprobing system allow the operator to navigate the <b>probe</b> <b>tips</b> with precise movement, allowing the user to see exactly where the tips will be landed, in real time.

Navigation of the <b>probe</b> <b>tips</b> in SEM based nanoprobers are typically controlled by precision piezoelectric manipulators.

40|$|MEMS {{storage devices}} are new {{non-volatile}} secondary storages that have outstanding advantages over magnetic disks. MEMS storage devices, however, are {{much different from}} magnetic disks in the structure and access characteristics. They have thousands of heads called <b>probe</b> <b>tips</b> and provide the following two major access facilities: (1) flexibility: freely selecting a set of <b>probe</b> <b>tips</b> for accessing data, (2) parallelism: simultaneously reading and writing data with the set of <b>probe</b> <b>tips</b> selected. Due to these characteristics, it is nontrivial to find data placements that fully utilize the capability of MEMS storage devices. In this paper, we propose a simple logical model called the Region-Sector (RS) model that abstracts major characteristics affecting data retrieval performance, such as flexibility and parallelism, from the physical MEMS storage model. We also suggest heuristic data placement strategies based on the RS model and derive new data placements for relational data and two-dimensional spatial data by using those strategies. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed data placements improve the data retrieval performance by up to 4. 0 times for relational data and by up to 4. 8 times for two-dimensional spatial data of approximately 320 Mbytes compared with those of existing data placements. Further, these improvements are expected to be more marked as the database size grows. ...|$|R

In PSTM and AFM the silicon nitride cantilever can be used as the optical <b>probe</b> <b>tip</b> in order to simultaneously perform (AFM) and PSTM. This allows comparison of the recorded optical signal with the higher resolution topography data obtained by AFM. Silicon nitride is a suitable material for an optical <b>probe</b> <b>tip</b> as it is optically transparent down to 300 nm. However, since it is not optically conducting, the photons collected by the <b>probe</b> <b>tip</b> must be focused through a lens to the detector instead of travelling through an optical fiber. The instrument can be operated in constant height or constant force mode and resolution is limited to 10-50 nm due to tip convolution. Since the optical signal obtained in PSTM is affected by the optical properties of the sample as well as topography, comparison of the PSTM data with AFM data allows determination of the absorbance of the sample. In one study, the 514 nm absorbance of a Langmuir-Blodgett film of 10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid (PCA) was recorded using this method.|$|E
