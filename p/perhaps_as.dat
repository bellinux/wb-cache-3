5|$|When {{discussing}} chess {{history from}} the 1850s onwards, commentators have debated whether Steinitz could be effectively considered the champion from an earlier time, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> early as 1866.

5|$|A basic {{sub-division}} is a {{grouping of}} the eight inner regular moons, which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter's equator and {{are thought to have}} formed with Jupiter. The remainder of the moons consist of an unknown number of small irregular moons with elliptical and inclined orbits, which are thought to be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. Irregular moons that belong to a group share similar orbital elements and thus may have a common origin, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> a larger moon or captured body that broke up.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} an apotropaic, mirrors {{have been used to}} ward off vampires when placed, facing outwards, on a door (in some cultures, vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> a manifestation of the vampire's lack of a soul). This attribute is not universal (the Greek vrykolakas/tympanios was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|Burchard {{continued}} to hold the treasurership until at least October 1194, when he last is mentioned in the office. In 1195, {{after the death of}} Hugh du Puiset, Burchard was a candidate for the see of Durham, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> part of a plan by his relative to pass the office on to his family. In June 1195 both Burchard and his rival, Philip of Poitou, were at the royal court in Le Mans, presumably both attempting to secure the bishopric. Philip was appointed to the see in November 1195.|$|E

Dactyl may have suffered a major impact around 100 million years ago, which reduced its size.|$|E
5|$|Dominik died on 16 November 1910. That same year, Atangana {{returned}} to Jaunde and received an administrative post, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> {{head of the}} Ewondo-Bane court, which presided over civil disputes and small claims and was the conduit through which the Germans transmitted communiqués (and gauged the response to them).

5|$|Edward {{married his}} second wife, Ælfflæd, {{at about the}} time of his father's death, {{probably}} because Ecgwynn had died, although she may have been put aside. The new marriage weakened Æthelstan's position, as his step-mother naturally favoured the interests of her own sons, Ælfweard and Edwin. By 920 Edward had taken a third wife, Eadgifu, probably after putting Ælfflæd aside. Eadgifu also had two sons, the future kings Edmund and Eadred. Edward had several daughters, <b>perhaps</b> <b>as</b> many as nine.|$|E

The body was taken to the Shaftesbury Abbey, a nunnery with royal connections which had been endowed by King Alfred the Great and where Edward and Æthelred's grandmother Ælfgifu had spent her latter years.|$|E
