30|$|We base our {{analysis}} on the Polish labour market. This choice stems {{from a number of}} reasons. Participation rates among persons aged 55 + in Poland are on average low compared to demographic characteristics observed in Europe in the twenty-first century. 5 In Poland, there is a so-called minimum retirement age. 6 It is the earliest age at which a worker can retire. Employers may not lay off workers when they reach the retirement age. A worker may sue an employer for being fired above the minimum retirement age. 7 The present value of paid contributions and the age at which the retiree starts receiving the payment determine the value of the old-age benefits. This amount reduces or even negates the level of tax on continued work. These regulations were implemented with the pension reform of 1999. However, the effective phasing of them started in 2009. Thus, these legal conditions have just begun to affect the situation in the Polish labour market. 8 They have not become strong factors behind retirement decisions yet, but data show a recent increase in participation rates and the actual retirement age in Poland (see Eurostat). 9 However, for {{our analysis}}, a legacy of the previous arrangements strongly matters. Until the new pension system was introduced (1999), it had been relatively easy to retire early in Poland. Average actual retirement age in the mid- 1990 s was roughly 55  years for women and 59 for men—irrespective to its formal level being 60 / 65.10 Although early retirement schemes are much less available now, some occupational groups (miners, uniform services, judges and prosecutors) can still enjoy them. The other groups in certain cases can apply for the so-called <b>pre-retirement</b> <b>benefit</b> (a kind of open-ended unemployment benefit that does not require any job search). The 2008 withdrawal of the early retirement schemes was made less drastic through implementation of bridging pensions that are temporal, difficult to obtain, not very generous and paid by employers. This has strongly reduced availability of early retirement for the future, but this did not wipe out the effects of previous arrangements, namely workers prematurely leaving the labour market.|$|E
