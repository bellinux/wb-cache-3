On the basis of the sound absorption theory of Micro <b>perforated</b> <b>plate</b> proposed by Prof. Daa-You Maa, Danqun Fang successfully developed a series of micro-perforated plate mufflers, which was widely used for sound absorption. From the 1970s, Danqun Fang led a team of acousticians, physiologists and doctors to research the influence of noise on hearing, cardiovascular, nervous system. After working out series of relationship between noise and brain, noise and deafness, noise and neurasthenia, he proposed noise standard for all places in industrial enterprise plants in China. His work led to the issue of the first China National Noise Standard for Industry in 1980. Five years later, with more comprehensive research by analyzing 11794 noise sources of 1034 factories and investigating noise exposure conditions of 62726 workers, Danqun Fang drew up “Industrial Noise Control Design Specification” for China, which was named as [...]|$|E

The finite-element method {{is used to}} {{study the effects of}} plate-support conditions, aspect ratio, and hole size on the mechanical buckling strength of the <b>perforated</b> <b>plates</b> subjected to linearly varying loading. Results show that increasing the hole size does not necessarily reduce the mechanical buckling strength of the <b>perforated</b> <b>plates.</b> It is also concluded that the clamped boundary condition increases the mechanical buckling strength of the <b>perforated</b> <b>plates</b> more than the simply-supported boundary condition and the free boundary conditions enhance the mechanical buckling strength of the <b>perforated</b> <b>plates</b> more effectively than the fixed boundary conditions.

Numerical analyses of square and rectangular <b>perforated</b> <b>plates</b> with centred and eccentric holes were developed. Results provide new insights into post-critical mechanisms in <b>perforated</b> <b>plates</b> subjected to localised loads when the length of the symmetrical compressive load, hole diameter and steel yield limit vary. An increase in the critical slenderness of the plate (a value at which transition from elastic to plastic collapse occurs) and a corresponding reduction in the elastic critical load occur when the dimensions of the hole increase. A further increase in the critical slenderness occurs when the length of the localised load is reduced. High-performance steel may be subject to buckling with a lower possibility of post-critical mechanisms: a reduction in critical slenderness occurs when the steel grade increases.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 8 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Mauritius, 11 - 13 July, 2011. A new method of obtaining flow resistance coefficient for <b>perforated</b> <b>plates</b> in low Reynolds number flows, such as natural air convection, was proposed. And some experimental values are obtained {{from the viewpoint of}} thermal design of electronic equipment casings where some perforations often used in the outlet and inlet vent to prevent dust from entering the casing. The proposed method is based on the two expressions written for the enthalpy balance and for the balance between aerodynamic resistance and buoyancy force in a ventilation model. By these two expressions, flow resistance coefficient values can be evaluated even when only dissipated power and temperature rise is known. As a result, the relationship of the flow resistance coefficient values for <b>perforated</b> <b>plates,</b> Reynolds number and porosity coefficient is presented in a form fitting for practical engineering use. 18 kinds of <b>perforated</b> <b>plates</b> have been used in this study and the range of Reynolds number defined by the hole diameter and the air velocity in the ventilation duct was from 0. 4 to 95.
