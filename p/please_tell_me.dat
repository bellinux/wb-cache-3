Actor and civil-rights activist George Takei (the original Hikaru Sulu in [...] ) posted a comment on Facebook stating that while he normally doesn't [...] "care about Miss America … the uproar over an Indian-American winning (whom many decried for being 'Arab') has me shaking my head. <b>Please</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> I'm not alone in wondering whether we've learned anything at all."

As an African-American woman with an ethnic name, I know the constant sting that comes from hearing how you are not American enough {{no matter how much you}} accomplish in the name of America." ...|$|E
