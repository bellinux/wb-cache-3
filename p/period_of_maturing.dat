40|$|Apricot {{cultivar}} assortment in Serbia {{is characterized}} by a small number of cultivars and a short <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>maturing.</b> Most apricot fruits are harvested in the season of cultivar ‘Hungarian Best’ or at a short time afterwards. There is particularly a lack of early- and late-maturing cultivars of high quality fruit. This study was aimed at evaluating of 14 introduced apricot cultivars of late maturing time in order to recommend the best of them for growing in the Belgrade region. The study was carried out at the Experimental station ‘Radmilovac’ of the Faculty of Agriculture in Belgrade over a period of five years (2009 - 2013). The experimental orchard was established in 2007, the rootstock was Myrobalan seedling, and tree spacing was 4. 5 x 3 m. Control cultivar for comparison was ‘Hungarian Best’, which is the most grown apricot cultivar in Serbia. Flowering of introduced cultivars ranged from three days before to three days after the control cultivar (‘Hungarian Best’), while the maturation time was 7 to 15 days after the control. Compared with the control cultivar, significantly higher yield was achieved in seven cultivars (‘Harogem’, ‘Umberto’, ‘Litoral’, ‘Sophia’, ‘Harlayne’, ‘Bergarouge’, and ‘Silistrenska Kompotna’), while significantly higher fruit weight was achieved in two cultivars (‘Cegledy Arany’ and ‘Sophia’). Compared to the control higher content of soluble solids was found in four cultivars (‘Kabaasi’, ‘Late Dryanovska’, ‘Harlayne’, and ‘Silistrenska Kompotna’). Cultivar ‘Sophia’ got the best score for fruit appearance, while cultivars ‘Late Dryanovska’ and ‘Silistrenska Kompotna’ got the best scores for taste. Among studied apricot cultivars, for the cultivation in the Belgrade region, the following cultivars can be recommended as promising: ‘Sophia’ for fresh consumption, and ‘Harlayne’ and ‘Silistrenska Kompotna’ for processing. In addition, five cultivars of combined traits (both for fresh consumption and processing) can also be recommended: ‘Harogem’, ‘Cegledy Arany’, ‘Bergarouge’, ‘Pisana’ and ‘Late Dryanovska’.

For the {{research}} the fermented cheese “Liliputas” was taken from UAB “Belvederio sūrinė” and the research {{was carried out}} in the laboratory of sensual analysis of the Nutrition Institute of Kaunas University of Technology. Project supervisor – Assoc. Prof. K. Pauliukas. Objective of the project is to adopt the production technology of the fermented cheese “Liliputas”, research the biochemical changes during the course of technological process, and determine the nutrition value. Research was carried out with the fermented cheese “Liliputas”, produced by UAB “Belvederio sūrinė”, by choosing the milk of the cowshed season and the milk of the pasturable season. Changes in the chemical composition and sensual indicators were researched in the laboratory of sensual analysis of the Nutrition Institute of Kaunas University of Technology. The following indicators were researched: pH, humidity (percentage), total nitrogen content (percentage), total protein content (percentage), total soluble nitrogen content (percentage), total soluble protein content (percentage), soluble non-protein nitrogen (percentage), free volatile fatty acids (VFA) NOOH ml, sensual properties (straw-color strength, elasticity when bending, solidity in mouth, viscosity (N), resiliency (mm), etc.). Maximum variation is observed with the free fatty acids when the cheese matures. Season did not have significant influence on the physical-chemical indicators. More intense straw-color strength as well as the smell of the fermented cheese is attributed to that cheese, which was produced during the pasturable season. Moreover, from the sensual properties we could observe that the cheese, produced during the pasturable season, was softer, more elastic, and a little bit more salty than the cheese, produced during the cowshed season. Cheese, produced during the pasturable season, was of the taste, more characteristic to the fermented cheese. After extra aging of the cheese, a slight difference according to the sensual indicators is observed {{under the influence of the}} season, however, it still remains. The most alterations of the indicators are observed during the periods of maturing. It is true to say that the most optimum <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>maturing</b> of the fermented cheese “Liliputas” is 2 months. Cheese, which has been matured for one month, is not mature enough.

Differentiation by somatotypes has been performed by the method of HT Kaarma (1991). All patients of each somatotype have been divided into primiparous (n = 402) and multiparous (n = 256). Preparation for delivery by mechanical means: on the 1 st day it was introduced into the cervical canal for 16 hours, on the 2 nd day — Foley catheter for 8 - 16 hours (before the birth). Results: In multiparous women the application of mechanical preparation of the birth canal has been effective regardless of somatotype. The percentage of operative delivery in mechanical induction has been lower in multiparous women and also not related to somatotype. In nulliparous women of asthenic and normosthenic type greater efficiency of mechanical induction in preparation for delivery has been revealed. In asthenic and pyknictype mechanical induction has been inefficient and therefore has not been recommended for the use.

40|$|T h e American realist artist John Sloan (1871 - 195 I), {{a leading}} member of The Eight and the Ashcan School, {{is best known}} for his {{paintings}} and etchings of New York City life at the turn of the twentieth century-pictures that have endured as major documents in art history. Given the social nature of his early images, contemporaries were perplexed when Sloan became almost exclusively preoccupied with what was perhaps the most unpopular genre in American art-the female nude. Yet despite disapproval from his peers and lack of public interest, he continued to focus o n nude studies for over twenty years, and created a series of unusual and disturbing images that so far have defied explanation. Formal analyses exist, but little has been written about the content of these pictures. My study bypasses the question of aesthetic quality that has troubled other ar t historians, and instead attempts to correlate these works with Sloan’s personal life and his early career. When interpreted in the light of his history and his own words, these images reveal Sloan’s intimate connection to his depicted female figures-a bond that emerges despite his attempt to maintain an objective distance from his subjects. My analysis is based on the work of D. W. Winnicott, who theorized that cultural prod-uction embodies o u r earliest, most profound relationship to o u r parents. As 1 will argue, t h e late nudes represent a n intense <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>mature,</b> re t rospect ive self-exploration.

The cylindrical shape of columnar cacti and the spherical shape of globular cacti produce a low surface area-to-volume ratio, thus reducing water loss, as well as minimizing the heating effects of sunlight. The ribbed or fluted stems of many cacti allow the stem to shrink during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> drought and then swell as it fills with water during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> availability. A <b>mature</b> saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) {{is said to be}} able to absorb as much as [...] of water during a rainstorm. The outer layer of the stem usually has a tough cuticle, reinforced with waxy layers, which reduce water loss. These layers are responsible for the grayish or bluish tinge to the stem color of many cacti.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognized}} since ancient times that malaria fever is highly periodic but the mechanism has been poorly understood. Malaria fever {{is related to the}} parasite growth cycle in erythrocytes. After a fixed <b>period</b> <b>of</b> replication, a <b>mature</b> parasite (schizont) causes the infected erythrocyte to rupture, releasing progeny that quickly invade other erythrocytes. Simultaneous rupture {{of a large number of}} schizonts stimulates a host fever response. Febrile temperatures are damaging to Plasmodium falciparum, particularly in the second half of its 48 -hr replicative cycle. Using a mathematical model, we show that these interactions naturally tend to generate periodic fever. The model predicts chaotic parasite population dynamics at high multiplication rates, consistent with the classical observation that P. falciparum causes less regular fever than other species of parasite...|$|R
40|$|O Ivanu Gunduliću (1589 - 1638) nema opsežnijih biografskih momenata. Kazneni spisi otkrivaju da je više puta bio sudac Kaznenoga suda. Njegova komunikacija s pojedincima iz puka, koji su uključeni proces, nije nikad izravna. Stječe se dojam kao da Gundulić nije izravno nazočan suočenjima na sudu, već prepušta rutiniranom pisaru da postavlja uobičajena pitanja. U radu se spominju i slučajevi u kojima se Gundulić i njegova uža rodbina javljaju kao stranke u postupku. A marked {{feature of}} the old Croatian {{literary}} scholarship {{is the absence of}} biographical data. The life and work of Ivan Gundulić, poet and author of the famous Osman, is also shrouded in mystery. While sifting through the archival records pertaining to the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> Gundulić’s <b>mature</b> years, the appearance of his name in the Criminal Records caught my attention. He had been appointed magistrate on several occasions and was recorded to have made his appearance in court as a plaintiff. The fact that he himself was prosecuted twice, encouraged my research into the trial records of the Criminal Court with the aim of establishing whether the discovered historical data could be of relevance to the study of his literary work and, if so, to what extent...|$|R
30|$|Juvenile {{period is}} defined as the time taken for a floristic species to {{reproduce}} following fire (Gill 1975), and the occurrence of lethal fire during the juvenile period can lead to localised extinction of the species (Gill and Nicholls 1989, Burrows and Friend 1998). Therefore, Gill and Nicholls (1989) suggest that to maintain community composition, the minimum fire return interval should be based around the conservative approach of doubling the juvenile <b>period</b> <b>of</b> the slowest <b>maturing</b> and fire sensitive species. Based on this recommendation, Burrows and co-workers defined a high fire frequency (synonymous with a regime of short fire return intervals) as one fire at fewer than six-year intervals for the environment in which our study occurred (Burrows and Friend 1998, Burrows et al. 2008). Hence, we defined our short fire return interval as being five years or less.|$|R
40|$|Novikoff cells (strain N 1 S 1 - 67) and L- 67 cells, a {{nutritional}} mutant {{of the common}} strain of mouse L cells which grows in the same medium as N 1 S 1 - 67 cells, were infected with mengovirus under identical experimental conditions. The synthesis of host-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) by either type of cell was not affected quantitatively or qualitatively until about 2 hr after infection, when viral RNA synthesis rapidly displaced the synthesis of cellular RNA. The rate of synthesis of protein by both types of cells continued {{at the same rate}} as in uninfected cells until about 3 hr after infection, and a disintegration of polyribosomes occurred only towards the end of the replicative cycle, between 5 and 6 hr. The time courses and extent of synthesis of single-stranded and double-stranded viral RNA and of the production of virus were very similar in both types of cells, in spite of the fact that the normal rate of RNA synthesis and the growth rate of uninfected N 1 S 1 - 67 cells are about three times greater than those of L- 67 cells. In both cells, the commencement of viral RNA synthesis coincided with the induction of viral RNA polymerase, as measured in cell-free extracts. Viral RNA polymerase activity disappeared from infected L- 67 cells during the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> production <b>of</b> <b>mature</b> virus, but there was a secondary increase in activity in both types of cells coincidental with virus-induced disintegration of the host cells. Infected L- 67 cells, however, disintegrated and released progeny virus much more slowly than N 1 S 1 - 67 cells. The two strains of cells also differed in that replication of the same strain of mengovirus was markedly inhibited by treating N 1 S 1 - 67 cells with actinomycin D prior to infection; the same treatment did not affect replication in L- 67 cells...|$|R
