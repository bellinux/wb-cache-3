25|$|Improper toilet {{training}} This {{is another}} disputed cause of bedwetting. This theory was more widely supported {{in the last}} century and is still cited by some authors today.

Recent research has shown more mixed results and a connection to toilet training has not been proven or disproven. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, more child abuse occurs during <b>potty</b> training than in any other developmental stage.|$|E
