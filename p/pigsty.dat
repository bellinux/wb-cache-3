5|$|The <b>Pigsty,</b> a small gardeners shed {{located on}} The Orchard, has been {{preserved}} {{as the first}} campsite at Gilwell Park.

25|$|The former Vorwerk in Neuland {{comprised}} five buildings, {{a residential}} house, a bakehouse, a <b>pigsty,</b> a granary and a crop barn. It is recalled by the field name Vorwerk in Neuland. The Vorwerk at Horst {{was in fact}} located in Breitenwisch on a plot now covered by the Jarck Farm. The outlying former socage farms attached to the Vorwerk at Horst, located at bit more northwest of the Vorwerk now form the village of Horst upon Oste.|$|E
25|$|Mediator sailed for Barbados {{towards the}} end of the 1785 {{hurricane}} season, but was becalmed off La Désirade for a night. The following day she was struck by a sudden squall that laid her on her beam ends. Further damage occurred when A terrible crash took part in the fore part of the ship, accompanied by a tremendous explosion and stench of sulphur, deep groans followed, - sixteen men upon the main deck were knocked down, some were apparently dead and others groaning; relief was instantly afforded, and in about four hours after all were apparently well again. A lightning ball had struck the fore topmast, passed into the <b>pigsty,</b> and through the galley into the waist, where it burst and overthrew seventeen men; eleven pigs in the sty before the mast were killed, belonging to the Captain; the silver buckles in the shoes of the gunner were melted into wire, and himself was knocked out of the roundhouse forward. Despite the dramatic nature of the lightning strike, no one was killed, except for the pigs, which Collingwood gave to the crew as a reward for their work in repairing the foremast. Collingwood took Mediator back to English Harbour to be careened in early 1786, and then returned to England to be paid off in August 1786.|$|E

500|$|In {{concurrence}} {{with the}} chain of events, after continuously getting into arguments, Jeff and Hayley decide to take marriage counseling. They arrive at a class dedicated to pottery where the session is intended to start at, learning the counselor to be Principal Lewis. Hayley opts out of the session, but Jeff insists that she stay with the plan. The couple later arrive at Principal Lewis' home, which is a <b>pigsty,</b> where he tells him that their first goal to accomplish is to clean his house. Confused, Hayley and Jeff refuse to do it, forcing Lewis to hold them at gunpoint to do the laborious tasks. Jeff later pulls out drugs that {{have the ability to}} paralyze, and Principal Lewis takes them and Hayley and Jeff steal his rare Mickey Mouse watch and escape. He returns to get the watch back and tells he has fixed Hayley and Jeff's relationship. After he gets his watch back, he takes more of the [...] "Stephen Hawking pills" [...] and is later used by Stan to teach Steve how to shave and Roger drags him away for unknown (but quite possibly sexual) reasons.|$|E
500|$|McCartney later said, [...] "We lived {{backstage}} in the Bambi Kino, {{next to the}} toilets, and {{you could}} always smell them. The room had been an old storeroom, and there were just concrete walls and nothing else. No heat, no wallpaper, not a lick of paint; and two sets of bunk beds, with not very much covers—Union Jack flags—we were frozen." [...] Lennon remembered: [...] "We were put in this <b>pigsty.</b> We {{were living in a}} toilet, like right next to the ladies' toilet. We'd go to bed late and be woken up next day by the sound of the cinema show and old German fraus [...] pissing next door." [...] After having been awoken in this fashion, the group were then obliged to use cold water from the urinals for washing and shaving. They were paid £2.50 each a day, seven days a week, playing from 8:30-9:30, 10 until 11, 11:30-12:30, and finishing the evening playing from one until two o'clock in the morning. German customers found the group's name comical, as [...] "Beatles" [...] sounded like [...] "Peedles", which meant a small boy's penis.|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of ticks of the Ornithodoros moubata complex in different habitats in Malawi, particularly <b>pigsties</b> and houses, was established from a four-phase survey undertaken between 1982 and 1985. The first phase consisted of preliminary interviews, {{the second phase}} consisted of a questionnaire to Veterinary Assistants (VAs) in rural areas, the third involved tick collections by VAs and the fourth involved both interviews and tick collections {{by members of the}} Central Veterinary Laboratory, Lilongwe. The area in which O. moubata is found in <b>pigsties</b> includes much of the African swine fever (ASF) enzootic area, and {{it seems likely that the}} enzootic area could become larger in future. The occurrence of O. moubata in warthog habitats was also investigated...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{correlation}} between farm characteristics and the occurrence {{and importance of}} rodent pests on outdoor pig farms in Denmark was explored in an extensive questionnaire survey. Mice occurred on most farms but were only rarely considered a problem, as opposed to rats, which were controlled on {{more than half of}} the farms. A series of trapping studies showed a high small-mammal diversity in and around the <b>pigsties.</b> The presence of rats was positively correlated with farm size, the presence of straw stacks near the <b>pigsties</b> and the use of automatic feeders. Rats were considered a problem more often when open drinking basins were used or when feed was stored near the <b>pigsties.</b> The environment of the farm did not play an important role except to some extent the proximity of hedges. Recommendations for preventative rodent management include avoiding conditions indicated previously, frequent mucking out and movement of huts, keeping feed in rodent-proof containers, avoid spillage of fodder, and general cleanliness. Direct control methods include application of rodenticides with proper consideration for the risk of unintended poisoning of production animals, the use of traps, keeping dogs or cats, and possibly shooting...|$|R
500|$|In October 2007, Lukashenko {{was accused}} of making anti-Semitic and anti-Israel comments; {{addressing}} the [...] "miserable state {{of the city of}} Babruysk" [...] on a live broadcast on state radio, he stated: [...] "This is a Jewish city, and the Jews are not concerned for the place they live in. They have turned Babruysk into a <b>pigsty.</b> Look at Israel – I was there and saw it myself ... I call on Jews who have money to come back to Babruysk." [...] Members of the US House of Representatives {{sent a letter to the}} Belarusian ambassador to the US, Mikhail Khvostov, addressing Lukashenko's comments with a strong request to retract them, and the comments also caused a negative reaction from Israel. Consequently, Pavel Yakubovich, editor of Belarus Today, was sent to Israel, and in a meeting with the Israel Foreign Ministry said that Lukashenko's comment was [...] "a mistake that was said jokingly, and does not represent his positions regarding the Jewish people" [...] and that he was [...] "anything but anti-Semitic," [...] and had been [...] "insulted by the mere accusation." [...] The Belarusian Ambassador to Israel, Igor Leshchenya, stated that the president had a [...] "kind attitude toward the Jewish people", and Sergei Rychenko, the press secretary at the Belarusian Embassy in Tel Aviv, said parts of Lukashenko's comments had been mistranslated.|$|E
500|$|Mao's father, Mao Yichang, {{had been}} born in Shaoshanchong to a family of poverty before {{undergoing}} an arranged marriage to Mao's mother, Wen Qimei, when he was fifteen years old. While Yichang had received two years of schooling and could read and write, conversely Qimei was illiterate. Serving for several years in the regional Xiang Army, Yichang saved up his wages and on leaving the army used these to pay off his family's debts and purchase the lands that his father had sold. By the time of Zedong's birth, Yichang owned two-and-a-half acres of rice paddy, which would have been considered a substantial amount {{by the standards of the}} region. Through frugal living and hard work, over the coming years he was able to purchase a further acre and employ two farm laborers, with his farm encompassing a cow shed, a grain storage hut, a <b>pigsty,</b> and a small mill. Expanding the family's wealth, Yichang purchased mortgages on other peasants' land, thus becoming their landlord, while also purchasing the grain from the poorest farmers in the village before selling it on for a profit at the county seat of Xiangtan. In doing so, he amassed a fortune of two to three thousand Chinese silver dollars at a time when the majority of China's peasantry continued to live in poverty. This being the case, Mao biographer Philip Short could assert that the Mao family were [...] "comfortably off" [...] by the standards of the period.|$|E

50|$|Suggested {{explanations}} {{for the name of}} Lose Hill include that it derives from the Old English hlose, meaning <b>pigsties,</b> or that it may be a corruption of ‘loose’, as in ‘free land’. Another author (Murray) argues that Lose Hill should actually be called Laws Hill.|$|R
2500|$|The pig toilet, which {{consists}} of a toilet linked to a <b>pigsty</b> by a chute, is still in use to a limited extent.

Moreover, college lecture assignments were scarce for the male Bells as the nearest university was in Toronto, some 105km (65 miles) away. The Bell family was not well-to-do, but upper-middle class, and depended on the sales of their farm products to make ends meet.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{their arrival}} in France, the former prisoners were brought {{together}} to undergo medical examinations. Then {{they were sent}} to different barracks to fill out forms and be interrogated. The authorities sought to assemble proof of ill-treatment, which the prisoners tended to deny {{so as to be}} reunited more quickly with their families. The poor condition of accommodations in France was noted by a number of men, including Charles Gueugnier: [...] "Entering there, the heart tightened; one was caught by an irrepressible disgust. They dared call this Augias <b>pigsty</b> American Park! Really, we were better and more properly housed by our Prussian enemies! Poor mothers, what will they do with your children?

2500|$|With {{several days}} to spare before they are due in Portsmouth, the trio stop off at the major cities along their route to provide bon-voyage adventures for Meadows. In Washington, DC, their first {{endeavor}} ends in failure when they are denied drinks at a bar, as Meadows is too young. Instead Buddusky gets a few six-packs so they all can get drunk in a hotel room. When Meadows passes out on the room's only real bed, the other two let him stay there and take the uncomfortable roll-away beds for themselves. In Camden they seek out Meadows' mother, only to find her away {{for the day and}} the house a <b>pigsty,</b> cluttered with empty whiskey bottles. They take him ice skating at Rockefeller Center in New York City. Buddusky tells Mulhall, [...] "the kid is 18, he will be out of prison at 26;" [...] they take Meadows to a brothel in Boston, so that he can lose his virginity. In between, they brawl with Marines in a public restroom, dine on [...] "the world's finest" [...] Italian sausage sandwiches, chant with Nichiren Shōshū Buddhists, and open intimate windows for each other in swaying train coaches.
