40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the effect of addition of <b>Poly</b> <b>tetramethylene</b> <b>ether</b> <b>glycol</b> (PTMEG) on the mechanical and flame retardance behaviour of novolac phenolic/carbon fiber composites (NPCC). The miscibility of PTMEG and novolac phenolic resin was studied using DSC. Both modified and unmodified novolac phenolic resins were characterised for chemical structure using FTIR. The 8 wt% PTMEG/NPCC yielded 39 % increase in impact strength {{compared to that of}} unmodified NPCC. Void content of the composites were measured. Both NPCC and PTMEG blended NPCC were tested for tensile strength (UTS), flexural strength (FS), inter laminar shear strength (ILSS) and impact strength. Also morphological studies were carried out using SEM. The UTS, FS, ILSS and impact strength of the modified NPCC showed better results at 8 wt% of PTMEG without any compromise on the flame retardancy. The fracture surface examination showed good adhesion between the fiber and the matrix in the modified NPCC...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Efficient {{delivery}} of anticancer chemotherapies such as paclitaxel (PTX) can improve treatment strategy {{in a variety}} of tumors such as breast and ovarian cancers. Accordingly, researches on polymeric nanomicelles continue to find suitable delivery systems. However, due to biocompatibility concerns, a few micellar nanoformulations have exquisitely been translated into clinical uses. Here, we report the synthesis of novel water-soluble nanomicelles using bioactive polyurethane (PU) polymer and efficient {{delivery of}} PTX in the human breast cancer MCF- 7 cells. Results The amphiphilic polyurethane was prepared through formation of urethane bounds between hydroxyl groups in <b>poly</b> (<b>tetramethylene</b> <b>ether)</b> <b>glycol</b> (PTMEG) and dimethylol propionic acid with isocyanate groups in toluene diisocyanate (TDI). The free isocyanate groups were blocked with phenol, while the free carboxyl groups of dimethylol propionic acid were reacted with triethylamine to attain ionic centers in the polymer backbone. These hydrophobic PTMEG blocks displayed self-assembly forming polymeric nanomicelles in water. The PTX loaded PU nanomicelles showed suitable physical stability, negative zeta potential charge (- 43) and high loading efficiency (80 %) with low level of critical micelle concentration (CMC). In vitro drug release profile showed a faster rate of drug liberation at pH 5. 4 as compared to that of pH 7. 4, implying involvement of a pH-sensitive mechanism for drug release from the nanomicelles. The kinetic of release exquisitely obeyed the Higuchi model, confirming involvement of diffusion and somewhat erosion at pH 5. 4. These nanomicelles significantly inhibited the growth and proliferation of the human breast cancer MCF- 7 cells, leading them to apoptosis. The real time RT-PCR analysis confirmed the activation of apoptosis as result of liberation of cytochrome c in the cells treated with the PTX loaded PU nanomicelles. The comet assay analysis showed somewhat DNA fragmentation in the treated cells. Conclusions Based upon these findings, we propose that the bioactive waterborne polyurethane nanomicelles can be used as an effective nanocarrier for delivery of anticancer chemotherapies such as paclitaxel. </p...|$|E
