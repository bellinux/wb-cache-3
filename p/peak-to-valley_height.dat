An RMS surface roughness of 7  nm was achieved, with a maximum <b>peak-to-valley</b> <b>height</b> of 30  nm. These values meet the smoothness requirements needed for most organic devices. The silver nanowires were successfully embedded in the substrate such that their sheet resistance changed less than 1 % after the tape test.

One {{of the factors that}} affect the measuring accuracy is the sensor 2 ̆ 019 s resolution. A high resolution sensor usually has a short measuring range. However, an unknown component 2 ̆ 019 s profile with a large <b>peak-to-valley</b> <b>height</b> variation can not usually be measured using a short range sensor. We designed and developed a measuring system based on an existing 3 -axis motion system with a laser displacement sensor mounted on its Z axis. This measuring system can be easily integrated to an existing laser processing system by standard communication ports to extend its applications into tool path planning, in-line inspection and monitoring. With the developed system, the real-time distance from the sensor to the component surface is acquired, and used as a feedback signal to control the sensor 2 ̆ 019 s position on the Z axis to automatically maintain its distance with a given value.

For this, they must undergo a sequential treatment, including roughening and hydrophobic coating. This contribution presents various preparation routes along with various characterization methods, such as dynamic contact angle (DCA) measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and spectroscopic techniques (FT–IRRAS, XPS, EIS). Micro-rough surfaces of pure and alloyed aluminum were generated most easily by using a modifie Sulfuric Acid Anodization under Intensifie conditions (SAAi). This produces a micro-mountain-like oxide morphology with <b>peak-to-valley</b> <b>heights</b> of 2 μm and sub-μm roughness components. Additionally, micro-embossed and micro-blasted surfaces were investigated. These micro-roughened initial states were chemically modifie with a solution of a hydrophobic compound, such as the reactive f uoroalkylsilane PFATES, the reactive alkyl group containing polymer POMA, or the polymer Teflo ® AF. Alternatively, the chemical modificatio was made by a Hot Filament Chemical Vapor Deposition (HFCVD) of a PTFE layer. The latter can form a considerably higher thickness than the wet-deposited coatings, without detrimental leveling effects being observed {{in comparison with the}} original micro-rough surface. The inherent and controllable morphology of the PTFE layers represents an important feature. The impacts of a standardized artificia weathering (WTH) on the wetting behavior and the surface-chemical properties were studied and discussed in terms of possible damage mechanisms.

40|$|Cost-effective {{machining}} of {{hardened steel}} (> 60 HRC) components {{such as a}} large wind turbine bearing poses a significant challenge. This thesis investigates a new laser tempering based hybrid turning approach to machine hardened AISI 52100 steel parts more efficiently and cost effectively. The approach consists of a two step process involving laser tempering of the hardened workpiece surface followed by conventional machining at higher material removal rates using lower cost ceramic tooling to efficiently cut the laser tempered material. The specific objectives of this work are to: (a) study the characteristics of laser tempering of hyper-eutectoid 52100 hardened steel, (b) model the laser tempering process to determine the resulting hardness, and (c) conduct machining experiments to evaluate {{the performance of the}} laser tempering based hybrid turning process in terms of forces, tools wear and surface finish. First, the microstructure alterations and phase content in the surface and subsurface layers are analyzed using metallography and x-ray diffraction (XRD) respectively. Laser tempering produces distinct regions consisting of - a tempered white layer and a dark layer- in the heat affected subsurface region of the workpiece. The depth of the tempered region is dependent on the laser scanning conditions. Larger overlap of laser scans and smaller scan speeds produce a thicker tempered region. Furthermore, the tempered region is composed of ferrite and martensite and weak traces of retained austenite (~ 1 %). Second, a laser tempering model consisting of a three dimensional analytical model to predict the temperature field generated by laser scanning of 52100 hardened steel and a phase change based hardness model to predict the hardness of the tempered region are developed. The thermal model is used to evaluate the temperature field induced in the subsurface region due to the thermal cycles produced by the laser scanning step. The computed temperature histories are then fed to the phase change model to predict the surface and subsurface hardness. The laser tempering model is used to select the laser scanning conditions that yield the desired hardness reduction at the maximum depth. This model is verified through laser scanning experiments wherein the hardness changes are compared with model predictions. The model is shown to yield predictions that are within 20 % of the measured hardness of the tempered region. Using the laser scanning parameters determined from the laser tempering model, cutting experiments using Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN) tools and low cost alumina ceramic tools are conducted to compare the performance of laser tempering based hybrid turning with the conventional hard turning process. The machining experiments demonstrate the possibility of higher material removal rates, lower cutting forces, improved tool wear behavior, and consequently improved tool life in the laser tempering based process. In addition, the laser tempered based hybrid turning process produce is shown to yield lower <b>peak-to-valley</b> surface roughness <b>height</b> than the conventional hard turning process. Furthermore, it is found that lower cost ceramic tools can be used in place of CBN tools without compromising the material removal rate.

For the experiments, rhododendron and commercially-manufactured-chip (Pinus sylvestris L. and Quercus robur L.) with 11 % moisture content were used. The mixing ratios of rhododendron with commercially-manufactured-chip were 100 : 0, 75 : 25, 50 : 50, 25 : 75 and 0 : 100 %, respectively. Commercial urea formaldehyde (UF) adhesive was used as a binder. A stylus method was employed to evaluate the surface characteristics of the samples. Roughness measurements by the stylus method were taken perpendicularly to the fiber. There was a significant difference (p= 0. 05) between surface roughness parameters (Ra, Rz, Rq, and Ry). The results obtained in this study revealed that all the panels have met the general purpose-use requirements of European Norm (EN). It was found that panels made with a 25 / 75 ratio of rhododendron to commercially-manufactured-chip had a significantly lower contact angle (88. 14 º) than panels made with a 100 / 0 ratio (117. 91 º).

On the PEO 1 surface SV-HFO cells attached and spread easily using the pores as anchoring sites for their extensions and showing cell-cell contact after 48 hours. The larger pores protruding from the PEO 5 surface suppressed cell adhesion. Deposition of extracellular matrix started earlier on the PEO 1 surface and after 21 incubation days a net-like structure well integrated with the porous surface was visible. Matrix mineralization was evidenced on both surfaces after 21 days. However, more uniform mineralized areas were observed on the PEO 1 surface whereas an accelerated mineralization was noticed after 14 days on the PEO 5 surface. In conclusion, by varying only one PEO process condition, significant changes occurred on the surface of Ti 6 Al 7 Nb alloy, which influenced both the early and late response of SV-HFO cells. The observed surface-induced effects indicated that surfaces produced at shorter oxidation time may be more beneficial for early osteogenesis.

40|$|Incompressible {{turbulent}} ﬂow in irregular rough channels is investigated using a ﬁnite-diﬀerence direct {{numerical simulation}} code which includes an iterative embedded boundary treatment to resolve the roughness. Seventeen industrially relevant rough surfaces with a wide variation in surface topography are considered. Various studies are conducted to understand the ﬂow physics {{and the relationship between}} key ﬂow parameters and surface topography. Studies at low values of friction Reynolds number, Reτ, for a single surface, show that the ﬂow is laminar up to Reτ = 89 and begins to develop quasi-periodic ﬂuctuations at Reτ = 89. 5. Fluctuations in the three velocity components continue to grow until Reτ = 91, and the ﬂow is turbulent for Reτ ≥ 92. Transition depends on the surface topography as some roughness peaks trigger ﬂuctuations before others. For all the surfaces, mean and turbulent ﬂow statistics are computed at Reτ = 180, for which the ﬂow is fully turbulent but transitionally rough. All surfaces are scaled to the same physical roughness height. Nevertheless, a wide range of roughness function, ∆U+, values is obtained, indicating that it depends not only on the roughness height but also on the detailed roughness topography. Other mean and turbulence ﬂow statistics also vary considerably depending on the surface topography. Next, based on the simulation results database at Reτ = 180, a newly formulated method, that determines which surface topographical properties are important and how new properties can be added to an empirical model, is tested. Optimised models with several roughness parameters are systematically developed for ∆U+ and proﬁle peak turbulent kinetic energy. In determining ∆U+, besides the known parameters of solidity and skewness, it is shown that the streamwise correlation length and rms roughness height are also signiﬁcant. The peak turbulent kinetic energy is determined by the skewness and rms roughness height, along with the mean forward-facing surface angle and spanwise eﬀective slope. A Reynolds number dependence study is conducted for a single surface, wherein the roughness height in viscous units, k+, is varied from the transitionally rough to the fully-rough regime in the range 3. 75 ≤ k+ ≤ 120. Excellent agreement with the experimental data of Nikuradse (Laws of ﬂow in rough pipes, NACA Technical Memorandum 1292, 1933) is observed. The value of equivalent sand-grain roughness height, k+s,eq, thus obtained is close to the mean <b>peak-to-valley</b> <b>height.</b> <br/...|$|E
