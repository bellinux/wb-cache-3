5000|$|Shortcrust <b>pastry</b> : Shortcrust <b>pastry</b> is the {{simplest}} and most common <b>pastry.</b> It is made with flour, fat, butter, salt, and water to bind the dough. This is used mainly in tarts. It is also the <b>pastry</b> that is used most often in making a quiche. The process of making <b>pastry</b> includes mixing of the fat and flour, adding water, and rolling out the paste. The fat is mixed with the flour first, generally by rubbing with fingers or a <b>pastry</b> blender, which inhibits gluten formation by coating the gluten strands in fat and results in a short (as in crumbly; hence the term shortcrust), tender <b>pastry.</b> A related type is the sweetened sweetcrust <b>pastry,</b> also known as pâte sucrée, in which sugar and egg yolks have been added (rather than water) to bind the <b>pastry.</b>|$|R
