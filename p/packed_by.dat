She had been about to board an El Al flight from New York to Tel Aviv via London. The bag had been <b>packed</b> <b>by</b> her Jordanian fiancé Nizar Hindawi, who had said he would join her in Israel where they were to be married.|$|E
5|$|In a {{move that}} was {{described}} {{as an act of}} hurt pride by social historian David Smith, but also as a manoeuvre to appease the Welsh supporters, in February 1897 the WFU wrote to the IRFB and withdrew their membership. The WFU claimed that they alone had authority over the matter because the IRFB did not have any rules regarding amateurism. The WFU then reinstated their subscription to Gould, and on Easter Monday 1897 a banquet was arranged at Drill Hall in Newport in Gould's honour. Many civic and sporting worthies were in attendance to witness the WFU president Sir John Llewellyn present Gould with the title deeds of a gift house. The 250 guests, including David A. Thomas, were joined by a reed and string orchestra, the band of the Fourth Battalion of the South Wales Borderers, and galleries <b>packed</b> <b>by</b> members of the public.|$|E
25|$|Most of the years, NDP funpacks were <b>packed</b> <b>by</b> {{selected}} {{members of}} the armed forces. In 2009, they were <b>packed</b> <b>by</b> prisoners through the Yellow Ribbon Project.

A similar funpack, the 'SG Funpack', was given out to every household, regardless of it attending the parade or not.|$|E

25|$|The Boonah Butter Factory {{closed on}} 1 March 1974 due to declining {{production}} {{as a result}} of low prices for milk and shifting agricultural practices in the region. The last batch of butter came off the production line at Boonah at 10:45am. It was <b>packed</b> <b>by</b> Hartley Schumacher with George Kubler, Stan Schlieff, Roydon Kubler and Sel Schneider watching. Milk products from Boonah were subsequently transported to Booval for processing with the majority of employees also transferring to Booval. Booval had ceased operation by 2011 and was demolished by 2016.|$|E
25|$|Before containerization, {{goods were}} usually handled {{manually}} as break bulk cargo. Typically, goods would be loaded onto a vehicle {{from the factory}} and taken to a port warehouse {{where they would be}} offloaded and stored awaiting the next vessel. When the vessel arrived, they would be moved {{to the side of the}} ship along with other cargo to be lowered or carried into the hold and <b>packed</b> <b>by</b> dock workers. The ship might call at several other ports before off-loading a given consignment of cargo. Each port visit would delay the delivery of other cargo. Delivered cargo might then have been offloaded into another warehouse before being picked up and delivered to its destination. Multiple handling and delays made transport costly, time consuming and unreliable.|$|E
25|$|Hume {{used his}} vast bird {{collection}} {{to good use}} as editor of his journal Stray Feathers. He also intended to produce a comprehensive publication on the birds of India. Hume employed William Ruxton Davison, who was brought to notice by Dr. George King, as a curator for his personal bird collection. Hume trained Davison and sent him out annually on collection trips to various parts of India as he himself was held up with official responsibilities. In 1883 Hume returned {{from a trip to}} find that many pages of the manuscripts that he had maintained over the years had been stolen and sold off as waste paper by a servant. Hume was completely devastated and he began to lose interest in ornithology due to this theft and a landslip, caused by heavy rains in Simla, which had damaged his museum and many of the specimens. He wrote to the British Museum wishing to donate his collection on certain conditions. One of the conditions was that the collection was to be examined by Dr. R. Bowdler Sharpe and personally <b>packed</b> <b>by</b> him, apart from raising Dr. Sharpe's rank and salary due to the additional burden on his work caused by his collection. The British Museum was unable to heed his many conditions. It was only in 1885 after the destruction of nearly 20000 specimens, that alarm bells were raised by Dr. Sharpe and the museum authorities let him visit India to supervise the transfer of the specimens to the British Museum.|$|E

2500|$|Taylorism {{approaches}} are largely prevalent in companies where machines can not perform certain activities.

2500|$|Harvesting {{occurs when}} the average size of celery in a field is marketable; due to {{extremely}} uniform crop growth, fields are harvested only once. The petioles and leaves are removed and harvested; celery is <b>packed</b> <b>by</b> size and quality (determined by colour, shape, straightness and thickness of petiole, stalk and midrib length and absence of disease, cracks, splits, insect damage and rot). [...] During commercial harvesting, celery is packaged into cartons which contain between 36 and 48 stalks and weigh up to 60 pounds. Under optimal conditions, celery can be stored for up to seven weeks between [...] Inner stalks may continue growing if kept at temperatures above [...] [...] Shelf life can be extended by packaging celery in anti-fogging, micro-perforated shrink wrap. Freshly cut petioles of celery are prone to decay, which can be prevented or reduced {{through the use of}} sharp blades during processing, gentle handling, and proper sanitation.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{following}} weeks, the Police Battalion 101 pacified towns with direct lines to Treblinka therefore the mass shooting operations were not scheduled. On 19 August 1942 – {{only two days}} after Łomazy – 3,000 Jews were deported from Parczew (2,000 more, several days later); from Międzyrzec 11,000 Jews were sent to Treblinka on August 2526 amid gunfire and screams. From Radzyń 6,000 prisoners, then from Łuków (7,000), Końskowola (2,000 coupled with massacre at the hospital), Komarówka, Tomaszów; all those unable to move or attempting to flee were shot on the spot. At the end of August death transports were temporarily halted. After a brief respite, shootings of Jews resumed on 22 September in Serokomla, than in Talczyn and in the Kock ghetto four days later, by the Second Company. The treatment of condemned prisoners was getting increasingly more terrifying as the time went on. [...] In Izbica, the makeshift ghetto reached a breaking point <b>packed</b> <b>by</b> Gnade with Jewish inhabitants of Biała Podlaska, Komarówka, Wohyń, Czemierniki. The October and November deportations to Bełżec and Sobibór led to a week of mass killings at the cemetery beginning on 2 November 1942. Several thousand Jews (estimated at 4,500) from the transit ghetto were massacred by the Sonderdienst battalion of Ukrainian Trawnikis in an assembly-line-style and dumped in hastily excavated mass graves under total police control. All men drank heavily.|$|E
2500|$|The {{arrangement}} {{and number of}} oarsmen is the first deciding factor {{in the size of}} the ship. [...] For a ship to travel at high speeds would require a high oar-gearing, which is the ratio between the outboard length of an oar and the inboard length; it is this arrangement of the oars which is unique and highly effective for the trireme. [...] The ports would house the oarsmen with a minimal waste of space. [...] There would be three files of oarsmen on each side tightly but workably <b>packed</b> <b>by</b> placing each man outboard of, and in height overlapping, the one below, provided that thalamian tholes were set inboard and their ports enlarged to allow oar movement. Thalamian is the English term for the Greek word, thalamios, which was the name of the oarsmen in the lowest file of the triereis; zygian is the English term for the Greek word, zygios, which were the oarsmen in the middle file of the triereis, and thranite is the English term for the Greek word, thranites, which were the oarsmen in the uppermost file of the triereis. [...] Tholes were pins that acted as fulcrums to the oars that allowed them to move. [...] The center of gravity of the ship is low because of the overlapping formation of the files that allow the ports to remain closer to the ships walls. [...] A lower center of gravity would provide adequate stability.|$|E
