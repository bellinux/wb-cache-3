50|$|Phelsuma grandis is a diurnal {{arboreal}} {{species of}} day gecko (<b>Phelsuma</b> <b>spp.).</b> These geckos {{are part of}} the Phelsuma group, which consists of in excess of 70 species and subspecies. They are commonly referred to as the Madagascar giant day gecko, due to their large size. They are native to areas of tropical and subtropical forest in northern Madagascar, but have been introduced to several other subtropical locations outside their range. P. grandis feeds on various invertebrates, very small vertebrates, and nectars.|$|E
40|$|The Mauritius Black Bulbul Hypsipetes olivaceus is a {{threatened}} passerine endemic to Mauritius. Direct observations of food items {{indicate that it}} is an arboreal omnivore. Animal prey consists mostly of insects and native day-geckoes (<b>Phelsuma</b> <b>spp.).</b> A wide variety of native and exotic fruits is also taken. The species is apparently monogamous, With an egg-laying season extending from at least November to February, usual clutch and brood sizes of two to three, ability rapidly to lay repeat clutches in a new nest, and post-breeding complete moult. In these respects, its annual cycle resembles that of the other native Mauritian passerines. It occurs at very low population density compared to its Indian Ocean congeners; possible reasons for this are given...|$|E
40|$|The {{invasion}} of the giant Madagascar day gecko Phelsuma grandis has increased the threats to the four endemic Mauritian day geckos (<b>Phelsuma</b> <b>spp.)</b> that have survived on mainland Mauritius. We had two main aims: (i) to predict the spatial distribution and overlap of P. grandis and the endemic geckos at a landscape level; and (ii) to investigate the effects of P. grandis on the abundance and risks of extinction of the endemic geckos at a local scale. An ensemble forecasting approach was used to predict the spatial distribution and overlap of P. grandis and the endemic geckos. We used hierarchical binomial mixture models and repeated visual estimate surveys to calculate the abundance of the endemic geckos in sites with and without P. grandis. The predicted range of each species varied from 85 km 2 to 376 km 2. Sixty percent of the predicted range of P. grandis overlapped with the combined predicted ranges of the four endemic geckos; 15 % of the combined predicted ranges of the four endemic geckos overlapped with P. grandis. Levin’s niche breadth varied from 0. 140 to 0. 652 between P. grandis and the four endemic geckos. The abundance of endemic geckos was 89 % lower in sites with P. grandis compared to sites without P. grandis, and the endemic geckos had been extirpated at four of ten sites we surveyed with P. grandis. Species Distribution Modelling, together with the breadth metrics, predicted that P. grandis can partly share the equivalen...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Six {{new species}} of coccidia are {{described}} from endangered <b>Phelsuma</b> <b>spp.</b> geckoes (Sauria: Gekkonidae) endemic to Mauritius, Indian Ocean. Five new species (3 Eimeria and 2 Isospora species) are described from Phelsuma rosagularis Vinson et Vinson; all lack a micropyle and an oocyst residuum, and all have a sporocyst residuum. Oocysts of Eimeria swinnertonae sp. n. are ellipsoidal, 22. 2 × 17. 8 (20. 8 – 24. 8 × 16. 8 – 18. 4) μm; SI 1. 25; polar granule absent. Sporocysts are ellipsoidal, 8. 8 × 7. 0 (8. 0 – 9. 6 × 6. 4 – 8. 0) μm; SI 1. 3; Stieda body absent. Oocysts of Eimeria stebbinsi sp. n. are ellipsoidal, 17. 4 × 11. 7 (16. 0 – 19. 2 × 11. 2 – 12. 8) μm; SI 1. 5; polar granules present. Sporocysts are elongate-ellipsoidal, 7. 7 × 4. 0 (7. 2 – 8. 0 × 3. 2 – 5. 6) μm; SI 1. 9; Stieda body present. Oocysts of Eimeria raleighi sp. n. are spheroidal to sub-spheroidal, 17. 0 × 15. 5 (16. 0 – 19. 2 × 14. 4 – 16. 8) μm; SI 1. 1; polar granule present. Sporocysts are sub-spheroidal, 7. 8 × 6. 6 (7. 2 – 8. 0 × 6. 4 – 7. 2) μm; SI 1. 2; Stieda body absent. Oocysts of Isospora cottinghamae sp. n. are ellipsoidal, 19. 8 × 15. 5 (17. 6 – 21. 6 × 14. 4 – 17. 6) μm; SI 1. 3; polar granules present. Sporocysts are ellipsoi-dal, 10. 8 × 6. 9 (9. 6 – 12. 8 × 6. 4 – 8. 0) μm; SI 1. 6; Stieda body present. Oocysts of Isospora pearlae sp. n. are ellipsoidal, 16. 0 × 11. 5 (15. 2 – 17. 6 × 9. 6 – 12. 8) μm; SI 1. 4; polar granule present. Sporocysts are ellipsoidal, 8. 8 × 5. 4 (8. 0 – 9. 6 × 4. 8 – 6. 4) μm; SI 1. 6; Stieda and substieda bodies present. One new Eimeria species is described from the blue-tailed day gecko, Phelsuma cepediana Merrem. Oocysts of Eimeria hartleyi sp. n. are sub-spheroidal to ellipsoidal, 18. 2 × 14. 5 (16. 0 – 20. 8 × 13. 6 – 16. 0) μm; SI 1. 26; polar granule...|$|E
