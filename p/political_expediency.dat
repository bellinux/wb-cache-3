It was this belief that had led the original STAC documents being leaked to the French.

40|$|The current post-historical {{era that}} we live in has {{transformed}} the transmission of national heritage into a pejorative term, due to humanity‘s commitment to a vague conception of democracy without any specific content and a vast number of subjective rights of uncertain efficacy. Nowadays, people replace the contextually bound notion of polités (Greek citizen), which has a very important historical background, with that of a person who tries to be liberated from the contingencies of history in order to acquire a new universality in abstracto. As a result, the universality of human rights has been regularly opposed to cultural specificities.

50|$|General Krivosheyev became {{widely known}} after the 1993 {{publication}} of the book titled Гриф секретности снят: Потери Вооруженных Сил СССР в войнах, боевых действиях и военных конфликтах (Transliteration: Grif sekretnosti snyat: poteri vooruzhyonnyh sil SSSR v voynah, boevyh deystviyah i voennyh konfliktah), originally in Russian, and about Soviet military casualties in various conflicts of the twentieth century, particularly in World War II. With Krivosheyev being the general editor of the book, this analysis prepared by historians based on declassified Soviet archival data represents the first comprehensive attempt to scientifically address the losses {{of the armed forces}} of the former Soviet Union during World War II. Previously, the number of human casualties was mostly a matter of political speculations, and widely fluctuated with changes in <b>political</b> <b>expediencies.</b> In 1997 Krivosheyev's book was translated and published in English under the title of Soviet Casualties and Combat Losses in the Twentieth Century.|$|R
5|$|In {{reality the}} House of Hohenzollern, of which Albrecht was a member, the ruling {{family of the}} Margraviate of Brandenburg, had been {{actively}} expanding its territorial influence; for example already in the 16th century in Farther Pomerania and Silesia. Motivated by a current <b>political</b> <b>expediency,</b> Sigismund Augustus in 1563 allowed the Brandenburg elector branch of the Hohenzollerns, excluded under the 1525 agreement, to inherit the Prussian fief rule. The decision, confirmed by the 1569 sejm, made the future union of Prussia with Brandenburg possible. Sigismind II, unlike his successors, was however careful to assert his supremacy. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, ruled after 1572 by elective kings, was even less able to counteract the growing importance of the dynastically active Hohenzollerns.|$|E

40|$|Neglected by {{traditional}} literary histories or misrepresented in gender-specific criticism, Eliza Haywood is properly a novelist whose innovations {{can be seen}} in the works of Defoe and Richardson. This thesis examines selected novels by the London-based Haywood (1693 ?- 1756) in light of their contributions to the novel form. It begins by considering her romance novellas as adaptations of the popular scandal novels of Delariviere Manley. Haywood's early fiction combines the concerns of amatory fiction with the <b>political</b> <b>expediencies</b> of satire. Over the course of her career, Haywood's early romance novellas expanded to become conduct novels. In their endorsement of a prudent conjugal happiness over erotic fulfilment, her later works exemplify the changing proprieties at the heart of the eighteenth-century British novel. The argument of this thesis is the contention that Haywood's prose fiction provides a fresh and significant perspective upon a pivotal period in eighteenth-century British fiction...|$|R

The letters described human rights violations and racial tension between prisoner staff and inmates. Filming began that year. Through the example of Wallens Ridge State Prison, the documentary explores the United States prison industry and the social impact of moving hundreds of thousands of inner-city minority offenders to distant rural outposts. The film displays competing political agendas that seem to align government policy with human rights violations, and <b>political</b> <b>expediencies</b> that bring communities into racial and cultural conflict, sometimes with prisoner suicide and prisoner abuse as consequences. Connections exist, in both practice and ideology, between human rights violations in Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo and physical and psychological abuse recorded in U.S. prisons.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} question that this article attempts to address is: {{what are the}} main policy paradigms that guide the opinion leaders throughout energy security matters within protracted conflict environments? Using the de facto divided island of Cyprus as our single case study, we will deliberately follow grounded theory {{in order to create}} conceptual definitions out of rudimentary “working ideas” that involve “protracted conflict environment”, “energy security” and stakes in “decision making”. This research enterprise involves openended interviews with the opinion-makers on the Island and “political discourse analysis” that identifies the quintessential aspects of the recently emerged energy debate. Drawing upon the work of Correlje and van der Linde (2006), we highlight two main paradigms: “markets and institutions” and “regions and empire”. In the first one, the business logic prevails upon <b>political</b> <b>expediencies</b> and geopolitical calculations, while in the second one, national and security concerns outweigh the business logic and the potential international economic integration. Through their interaction, we seek to explore how they drive the debate on energy security within the realm of a conflict environment...|$|R

40|$|Few {{countries}} attribute as much {{importance to}} the Second World War and its memory as Britain; arguably nowhere else has this conflict developed such longevity in cultural memory and retained such presence in contemporary culture. Long Shadows is about how literature and film have helped shape this process in Britain. More precisely, the essays collected here suggest {{that this is a}} continuous work in progress, subject to transgenerational revisions, <b>political</b> <b>expediencies,</b> commercial considerations, and the vicissitudes of popular taste. It would indeed be more accurate to speak of the meanings (plural) that the war has been given at various moments in British cultural life. These semantic variations and fluctuations in cultural import are rooted in the specificity of the British war experience, in the political aftermath of the war in Europe, and in its significance for Britain’s postwar position on the global stage. In other words, the books and films discussed in these essays respond to how the war has been interpreted and remembered; what is at stake {{is the way in which}} the war has been emplotted as a hegemonic cultural narrative about Britain...|$|R

40|$|The {{grid square}} method {{as used in}} Japan has been {{standardized}} by the government, by use of {{the lines of the}} earth's latitude and longitude. The basic unit covers an area of approximately one square kilometer. An evaluation of this method is focused on the geographical distribution of cancer mortality in the city of Tokyo over a period of six years. The results indicated that for stomach and lung cancers, there was a very cleargeographical distribution. High stomach cancer areas were similar for both males and females, and by comparing data with census data, it was evident that the blue-collar areas showed high mortality. High lung cancer areas were also similar for both males and females, but the distribution was opposite to that of stomach cancer, i. e., the higher mortality was observed in white-collar areas. Because the basic area unit of one square kilometer was too small for statistical analysis of geographical distribution, the moving average of nine grid squares as well as a "combined grid square method " based on population density was used. By this study a number of advantages of the grid square method as opposed to methods employing existing government boundaries became evident. The boundary lines do not move with <b>political</b> <b>expediencies.</b> X-Y coordinates can be easily defined for statistical analyses by computer, facilitating computer mapping, calulating the center of distribution, determination of the contour lines, and the estimation of values in places which lie between sampling stations...|$|R

40|$|This study {{engages in}} a {{conceptual}} analysis {{of human rights}} in Islam and international law, and the application of this analytical discourse to explore the nature of women's human rights in the Islamic tradition. It has been argued that women's human rights in Islam are not entirely irreconcilable with current formulations of international human rights instruments emanating from the United Nations. The basic premise of the argument stems from a recognition that the Islamic legal tradition is not a monolithic entity. On the basis of its main sources, namely the Quran, Hadith, Ijma and Qiyas, Islamic law lends itself to a variety of interpretations that have far reaching implications for women's human rights in Islam. (Part I) A further factor raised in this study is the disparity between the theoretical perspectives on women's human rights, and, its application to Muslim jurisdictions determined by elements of cultural practices, socio-economic realities and <b>political</b> <b>expediencies</b> on the part of governments. The present study uses the example of Pakistan to demonstrate the divergence between theory and practice of Islamic law in these jurisdictions. The concept of what has been termed an emerging 'operative' Islamic law, consisting of a combination of elements including principles of Islamic law, secular codes of law and popular custom and usage has also been introduced. (Part II) Part III of the thesis is devoted to an evaluation of the development of the international norm of non-discrimination on the basis of sex and some 'Islamic' human rights documents affecting women's human rights. The analysis provides an insight into the response of Muslim States to international human rights instruments affecting women through a discussion in the light of reservations to the Women's Convention. The study concludes by posing the question whether a move towards convergence between international and Islamic schemes of women's human rights is discernible or not...|$|R
40|$|The United Kingdom Governments’ third stream {{education}} policy {{is becoming increasingly}} important for the higher education sector and, in some universities, has become the second stream, after teaching and learning; replacing research. Third stream, originally described as income generation, has more completely been defined by commentators as the generation and exploitation of knowledge, technology and other university capabilities. The amount of third stream Government funding continues to increase year on year. This study has focused upon the adoption and implementation of third stream activities at a traditional university, a new university, and at a college with {{a significant amount of}} higher education provision. This study has identified the complexity of policy–making and the imprecise nature of the process. There is a strong case that policy does not emerge as intended. Policy-making is complex, dynamic and often incremental; and is subjected to influences such as the power of globalisation and the experiences and <b>political</b> <b>expediencies</b> of politicians. A qualitative approach to this research, drawing upon ethnographic methods, was selected due to the need to collect raw data in a broad range context. Grounded theory provided a means of data analysis that suited the complexity of the subject and the richness of the data. The number of issues that this study has identified is broad; ranging from the divided views on the benefits of third stream policy to the ability and willingness of academics to engage in third stream activities. The study has revealed that dissemination of third stream policy to academics at the three host institutions is not comprehensive. The issue of incentives for academics to engage in third stream is seen as being vital by commentators, interviewees and the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) ...|$|R
