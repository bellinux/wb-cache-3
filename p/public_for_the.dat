5|$|After {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone advisory was issued on Tropical Storm Dorothy, a hurricane watch and storm warning were issued for the Leeward Islands from Dominica northward. As its westward track became more apparent, the watches and warnings were extended southward to include Martinique and Saint Lucia. On Martinique, authorities {{released a statement}} that warned the <b>public</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> potential for strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough waves. Also on the island, officials converted schools and government buildings into shelters for people in low-lying areas. As {{a result of the}} storm, the Martinique Aimé Césaire International Airport in Le Lamentin was closed.|$|E
5|$|At the 1928 {{election}} Bruce's {{government was}} returned to power, but it now had a majority of just nine a fragile result, given the growing propensity for Nationalist member defections. Most of the Nationalists' parliamentary gains from 1925 had been wiped out. James Scullin had assumed {{the leadership of the}} ALP earlier in the year, upon the retirement of Charlton, and the party was invigorated as a consequence. Bruce was undeterred, though, and became convinced that unless costs of production for industry in Australia could be lowered and industrial peace secured, Australia was heading towards a major economic crisis. This doctrine was the basis of his appeals to the <b>public</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next year and a half.|$|E

5|$|Construction of two prototypes {{began in}} February 1965: 001, built by Aérospatiale at Toulouse, and 002, by BAC at Filton, Bristol. Concorde 001 {{made its first}} test flight from Toulouse on 2 March 1969, piloted by André Turcat, and first went {{supersonic}} on 1 October. The first UK-built Concorde flew from Filton to RAF Fairford on 9 April 1969, piloted by Brian Trubshaw. Both prototypes were presented to the <b>public</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time on 7–8 June 1969 at the Paris Air Show. As the flight programme progressed, 001 embarked on a sales and demonstration tour on 4 September 1971, which {{was also the first}} transatlantic crossing of Concorde. Concorde 002 followed suit on 2 June 1972 with a tour of the Middle and Far East. Concorde 002 made the first visit to the United States in 1973, landing at the new Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Airport to mark that airport's opening.|$|E
5|$|Following {{repeated}} heavy bombing by Allied forces during Operation Crossbow, the Germans {{were unable}} to complete the construction works and the complex never entered service. It was captured by the Allies in September 1944, partially demolished on the orders of Winston Churchill to prevent its reuse as a military base, and then abandoned. It remained derelict until the mid-1990s. In 1997 it opened to the <b>public</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time, as a museum. Exhibits in the tunnels and under the dome {{tell the story of}} the German occupation of France during World War II, the V-weapons and the history of space exploration.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, {{the castle}} was leased for 22 years by Anthony and Bunty Kinsman, {{at a cost}} of £1,000. The {{property}} required extensive structural repairs and renovations in order to be made habitable, which the Kinsmans undertook over the next two years. The construction work cost £8,596, and some financial support was provided by the Ministry of Works in exchange for the castle being opened to the <b>public</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next fifteen years. The new oak doors in the castle were fitted with iron hinges that had originally been used in nearby Lowther Castle. In 1967, the castle was visited by Princess Sharada Shah, the daughter of the King Mahendra of Nepal, as part of an official trip to the UK.|$|E

5|$|In August 2007, reports emerged {{suggesting}} My Bloody Valentine would reunite for the 2008 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California, United States. Similar reports had {{circulated in}} 2003, stating that Shields, Butcher and Ó Cíosóig were together in Berlin, Germany, re-recording five songs recorded for Glider, which were due for release on an upcoming box set; and in 2007, reports suggested My Bloody Valentine {{were due to}} perform at a series of Pod-organised concerts at the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Kilmainham, Dublin. Shields later confirmed the reunion {{and said that the}} band's third studio album, which he had begun recording in 1996, was near completion. Three live shows in the United Kingdom were announced in November 2007 and on 13 June 2008, My Bloody Valentine performed in <b>public</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time in 16 years during two live rehearsals at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{birds have}} {{appeared}} in books illustrated by some exceptional artists, producing images that were accurate and beautiful, and that made use of the latest available printing techniques. The wood engraver Thomas Bewick's 1797–1804 A History of British Birds brought affordable illustrations to the <b>public</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time, and the book formed in effect the first field guide to birds, while John James Audubon's enormous and impressive images of birds in his 1827–1838 Birds of America {{are among the most}} admired by art critics and by collectors: early editions fetch among the highest prices paid for any printed books. The ornithologist John Gould's bird illustrations, in books such as A Century of Birds hitherto unfigured from the Himalaya Mountains (1830–1833) with 80 plates, and his 7-volume The Birds of Australia (1840–1848) with 600 plates, related directly to his research, were both beautiful and scientifically useful.|$|E
5|$|No further {{military}} use {{was made}} of the bunker and the land on which it stands reverted to private ownership. It was left abandoned for many years before the owners decided to redevelop the site. In 1973, the bunker was opened to the <b>public</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time under the name of Le Blockhaus d'Éperlecques. The ownership was taken over by Hubert de Mégille in the mid-1980s and on 3 September 1986 the French state declared it a monument historique. The area around the bunker has been re-forested, though it is still heavily scarred by bomb craters, and various items of Second World War military equipment (including a V-1 on a launch ramp) are on display alongside paths around the site. An open-air trail leads to and around the bunker with interpretative signs posted at various points {{to tell the story of}} the site and the German V-weapons programme. In 2009, the museum welcomed 45,000 visitors.|$|E

In 2016, Turner announced his second album with The Last Shadow Puppets, Everything You've Come to Expect. Helders played the drums on Iggy Pop's album Post Pop Depression. On 6 July 2016, all {{four members of}} the band appeared together in <b>public</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time since the end of their AM tour.

5|$|Sega {{announced}} {{the release of}} the Mega-CD in Japan for late 1991, and North America (as the Sega CD) in 1992. It was unveiled to the <b>public</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time at the 1991 Tokyo Toy Show, to positive reception from critics. The Mega-CD would go on to be released in Japan on December 12, 1991, initially retailing at JP¥49,800. Though the unit sold quickly, the small install base of the Mega Drive in Japan meant that sales declined rapidly after launch. Within its first year in Japan, the Mega-CD only sold 100,000 units. Third-party development of games for the new system suffered because Sega took a long amount of time to release software development kits. Other factors impacting sales included the high launch price of the Mega-CD in Japan and only two titles being available at launch.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{performed}} in <b>public</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{first time in}} four years in 2004, appearing with an octet at the Blue Note Jazz Club in New York.

In 2006, Let's Get to the Nitty Gritty: The Autobiography of Horace Silver, was published by the University of California Press. A 2008 release, Live at Newport '58, from a Silver concert fifty years earlier, reached the top ten of Billboards jazz chart.|$|E
