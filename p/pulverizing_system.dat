40|$|Abstract: <b>Pulverizing</b> <b>system</b> is {{the main}} energy-consumption {{equipment}} in coal-fired power plant. In China, coal-fired power plants are obliged to alter operation condition {{in response to the}} frequent change of unit load and coal quality, which results in non-standard operation condition and extra energy consumption of pulverization system in consequence. Hence it is of great significance to study energy-saving and optimization of <b>pulverizing</b> <b>system.</b> This paper first analyzes the influence factors on energy consumption of <b>pulverizing</b> <b>system</b> respectively according to literature survey. Due to the large numbers of influence parameters and their complex interactions, these parameters are certain to influence power consumption synergistically in the form of dynamic non-linear variation. This paper groups and defines these parameters into three categories, namely external parameters, constrained parameters, and controlled parameters. Based on the definition, the general model considering all the three groups of parameters is proposed, which considers all the influence factors for energy consumption under all unit conditions.

40|$|Torrefaction is a thermo-chemical {{process for}} {{upgrading}} biomass {{that is usually}} run at temperatures ranging from 200 to more than 300 °C in an oxygen-free atmosphere and at ambient pressure. It is a useful pre-treatment technology for biomass that significantly alters its physical and chemical composition, making it more efficient in <b>pulverized</b> <b>systems.</b> This paper investigates the grindability of eucalyptus chips torrefied at temperatures ranging from 210 °C to 270 °C for a 15 min residence time, compared to raw material before and after fluidization. The tests were carried out in a cold flow fluidization bed chamber with an internal diameter of 150 mm, with air as the fluidizing medium and a chamber height of up to 750 mm. Biomass grindability was assessed by evaluating the change in particle size distribution.

40|$|A new {{approach}} is proposed to retrace the combined effects of temperature and duration within {{the thickness of}} heat-treated Fagus sylvatica wood. Torrefaction is a mild pretreatment of biomass carried out at 200 - 300 degrees C to improve its properties for <b>pulverized</b> <b>systems</b> such as gasification. The properties of wood treated at high temperature {{are closely related to}} chemical modifications induced by temperature levels and treatment duration. This study involved the spectral analysis of solid wood in the near infrared range with the aim of developing a predictive model for process assessment. Samples of beech wood were used for calibration under high temperature conditions of 220, 250 and 280 degrees C for land 8 h. For prediction, a SO-mm thick solid piece of wood was treated at 250 degrees C for 3 h. It was demonstrated that it is possible not only to distinguish between wood samples that have undergone different heat treatments, but also to retrace the thermal history of a piece of wood. Statistical processing showed the compensatory effects of temperature and duration, along with the existence of an exothermal reaction in the solid piece of wood. It should thus be possible to ensure cheaper and faster quality control in continuous torrefaction processes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a solution for}} the detection and control of coal loads that is more accurate and convenient than those currently used. To date, no research has addressed {{the use of a}} grinding medium as the controlled parameter. To improve the accuracy of the coal load detection based on the kinetic energy of balls in a tubular ball mill, a Discrete Element Method (DEM) model for ball kinematics based on coal loads is proposed. The operating process for a ball mill and the ball motion, as influenced by the coal quality and the coal load, was analyzed carefully. The relationship between the operating efficiency of a coal <b>pulverizing</b> <b>system,</b> coal loads, and the balls’ kinetic energy was obtained. Origin and Matlab were utilized to draw the variation of parameters with increasing coal loads in the projectile and cascading motion states. The parameters include the balls’ real-time kinetic energy, the friction energy consumption, and the mill’s total work. Meanwhile, a method of balanced adjacent degree and a physical experiment were proposed to verify the considerable effect of the balls’ kinetic energy on coal loads. The model and experiment results indicate that a coal load control method based on the balls’ kinetic energy is therefore feasible for the optimized operation of a coal <b>pulverizing</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

40|$|Fluidized bed {{combustion}} (FBC) boilers {{are receiving}} considerable attention by the utility and industrial business sectors in the United States {{and other nations}} for several reasons. The most significant of these are: 1. The FBC boiler can be designed to burn many solid fuels which are troublesome to burn in suspension (<b>pulverized</b> coal) firing <b>systems.</b> 2. The SOX removal process is integral with the combustion process rather than a separate system subject to upsets during combustion transients. 3. NOX production is low because of the lower combustion temperatures. 4. Waste is in a dry form. Although the most attention is directed toward atmospheric fluidized bed combustion (AFBC) because of its simplicity, AFBC does not offer substantial improvement in operating economy over <b>pulverized</b> coal <b>systems.</b> Steam conditions are essentially the same, heat rate is a stand-off, and boiler size is little different. However, significant differences are apparent when pressurized fluidized bed combustion (PFBC) is considered.

Even though the main objective of the power plant is to meet the increasing power demand at low cost, still it is behind the expectations due to low reliability of the power plant. Failures in the boiler side equipment have been considerably responsible for this with a huge financial loss to the country. This project studies the suitable designs for design faults and shortcomings of LVPS to improve {{the reliability of the}} power plant related to the boiler side. By analyzing the past data until the first overhaul of the power plant, it is revealed that the main failures are arisen in the primary air system, coal <b>pulverizing</b> <b>system,</b> secondary air and flue gas systems related to the boiler side. In addition to the low reliability of primary air system, it is not supplying the required total amount of primary air to the system to run the pulverizers within the safe margins.

Failures related to the pitch controllers of forced draft fans and induced draft fans resulting to high vibrations and high bearing temperatures directly affect to the low reliability in the secondary air and flue gas system. Variable speed drivers to control the air flow instead of fan pitch controlling or inlet vane controlling methods are discussed in this paper.

For direct firing <b>pulverizing</b> <b>system,</b> the measuring is essentially affected by pulverized coal particles. Abrasion and occlusion would bring great trouble to the measurement. Many measuring methods are invalid under that circumstance. Lots of efforts have been made to find appropriate ways to measure the flow of primary air containing pulverized coal. Venturi tube had been successfully used to measure the flow of air. If a venturi tube is used to measure the flow velocity of primary air, the differential pressure goes higher with the increase of the concentration of pulverized coal in the primary air. The neglect of the affection of pulverized coal on the measuring would result in remarkable deviation. With the aids of coal flow rate, a method of using venturi tube to measure the velocity of primary air containing pulverized coal was established. The affection of pulverized coal on flow measuring of primary air cannot be ignored...|$|E

Knowing and understanding the hazards involved are the first steps in developing safe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a comprehensive program of experiments in which fly ash particles were impacted under controlled conditions against a flat steel surface. The overall aim of these experiments was to gain an understanding of the ash deposition process in a <b>pulverized</b> coal boiler <b>system.</b> A continuous nitrogen flow carrying fly ash particles was used to examine the effect of particle incident velocity and particle diameter (dp) on the normal restitution coefficient, and of the particle diameter on the critical velocity. The effect of the incident normal velocity and particle diameter on the normal restitution coefficient was also examined. The results show that the normal restitution coefficient increases rapidly with increasing incident velocity when this incident velocity is less than the yield velocity, and rapidly decreases with increasing incident velocity when the incident velocity is greater than the yield velocity. The critical velocity, determined solely by the first-contact energy loss, is proportional to dp− 5 / 6 and therefore becomes larger for smaller particles. For instance, in the present work, the velocity vc of a particle with diameter of 85 μm is 0. 19 m/s, which increases to 0. 42 m/s for particles with a diameter of 65 μm...|$|R
