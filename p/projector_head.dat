50|$|Regardless of {{the sound}} format, any sound {{represented}} on the film image itself {{will not be the}} sound for the particular frame it occupies. In the gate of the <b>projector</b> <b>head,</b> there is no space for a reader, and the film is not travelling smoothly at the gate position. Consequently, all optical sound formats must be offset from the image because the sound reader is usually located above (for magnetic readers and most digital optical readers) or below (for analog optical readers and a few digital optical) the <b>projector</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} way of converting existing projectors {{is to add}} a so-called penthouse digital soundhead above the <b>projector</b> <b>head.</b> However, for new projectors {{it made sense to}} use dual analogue/digital soundheads in the normal optical soundhead position under the <b>projector</b> <b>head.</b> To allow for the dual-soundhead arrangement the data is recorded 26 frames ahead of the picture. If a penthouse soundhead is used, the data must be delayed in the processor for the required amount of time, around 2 seconds. This delay can be adjusted in steps of the time between perforations, (approximately 10.4 ms).|$|E

50|$|One of {{the more}} {{significant}} achievements of High End Systems was {{the introduction of the}} DMX-controlled media server called Catalyst in 2002. Up until that point, media servers were manually-operated systems where the media, either tape or video computer files, were switched using a push button matrix switcher or a T-handle switcher to crossfade between sources. In 2000, High End Systems introduced a digital projection system with a video <b>projector,</b> Orbital Mirror <b>Head,</b> and a DMX-controlled media server that interfaced with a lighting console. It allowed a lighting programmer to program the video switching and effects into the lighting console and play them back as part of the light show. The first such system was called Catalyst, but Catalyst evolved into the DMX-controlled media server while the Orbital Mirror Head was marketed alone.|$|R

40|$|Background: To enhance {{successful}} communication medical {{teachers are}} increasingly using different visual aids. Objective: To determine medical students perception of different visual aids like black board (BB), over <b>head</b> <b>projector</b> transparencies (OHPT) and, LCD and to generate recommendations for their optimal use. Methods: A questionnaire based study {{was carried out}} among first year MBBS students of Government Medical College, Kota, India. The survey was undertaken among 84 Medical students of first year MBBS of batch 2008 after exposing them to different visual aids like BB, OHPT and LCD in Physiology lectures. A few lectures were absolutely on BB, and some were on OHPT and on LCD. Few classes were taken with mixed visual aids. Students were exposed for such visual aids for one year {{and then they were}} requested to complete a questionnaire. Data were statistically analyzed by One Sample Chi-square test. Results: 55 (65. 48 %) students rated chalk & black board as best visual aids in understanding the topic better as compared to OHPT and LCD (P< 0. 01). 47 (55. 95 %) students have good learning experience with black board teaching and it is best mode to note down important points. 56 (66. 66 %) students favored LCD as more interesting and interactive visual aids (P< 0. 01).

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of the inquiry that was carried out among the secondary school teachers of English in Łódź by the Department of Applied Linguistics of the Institute of English, University of Łódź, four years ago. The inquiry concerned the use of audio-visual (AV) aids in the process of teaching English in secondary schools. Majority of the inquired teachers use AV aids during lessons: the most popular aids are tape-recorders and gramophones; film projector is used very rarely. It is striking that <b>head</b> <b>projectors</b> are not used very often though the schools seem to be well provided with the projectors. According to the answers, the advantages of AV aids are (among others) : bringing variety to the lesson, increasing the pupils' interest and giving them the best models of pronunciation. The most important disadvantages are: problems in achieving pupils' full concentration on the lesson, lack of suitable materials for AV aids and the fact that a teacher needs {{a lot of time to}} prepare a lesson with the use of AV aids. The inquired teachers claim they are well prepared to use AV aids during lesson though they may have problems with operating more complicated equipment (language lab, film projector). It appears from the results of the inquiry that there are still difficulties in supplying the schools and the teachers with suitable materials for AV aids. It is also important that the students, prospective teachers of English, should be instructed not only in operating but also the principles of the use of AV aids in the process of teaching English.

40|$|Background: Despite strict guidelines, {{error in}} tooth {{preparation}} was reported {{as one of}} the main causes of failure. Many studies had been performed to evaluate tooth preparation in order to be acquainted with the defects and solve them. Design: A descriptive cross sectional clinical study. Setting: Department of Conservative Dentistry in two different Dental Schools • University of Khartoum /U of K. (governmental) • University of Science and Technology /UST. (Private) Objectives Evaluate the different aspects of tooth preparation for full veneer casting restorations performed by final year dental students. Methods One hundred and seventeen stone dies were evaluated, of which 100 were prepared as abutments for bridges whereas only 17 of them were prepared to receive crowns. Two impression replicas were produced by polyvinyl siloxane (additional silicon); one was sectioned in faciolingual plane and the other in mesiodistal plane. By using a digital caliber occlusal clearance was measured in functional cusp (FC), non functional cusp (NFC) and central fossa (cf) areas. The amount of axial preparation in facial, lingual, mesial, and distal walls were also measured by a digital caliber. Impression silhouettes that were produced by using over <b>head</b> <b>projector</b> were used to measure convergence angle. Working casts were examined for smoothness and evenness of the preparations, existence or absence of additional features of retention and the finishing line was examined for its position and continuity. Results The average taper (convergence angle) of the examined preparations was 39. 98 °, with 44. 1 ° faciolingual, and 35. 8 ° mesiodistal. This is regarded significantly out of ideal range that must be achieved clinically. Occlusal clearance for PFM for both anterior and posterior teeth was acceptable, whereas preparations for full metal restorations were overcut. The amount of axial preparation for PFM was acceptable, and the result was significant; however the amount of facial wall preparation was also acceptable but the result was not statistically significant. In preparations for full metal restoration, the axial walls were over prepared {{with the exception of the}} lingual wall which was ideally prepared for metal. Sub and supra gingival finishing lines were present in equal percentage, however (38. 5 %) of the preparations have mixed finishing lines i. e. areas with subgingival lines and others with supra gingival lines in the same preparation. Most of the students (77. 8 %) were able to maintain continuity of the finishing line all around the preparation, although a significant number of them (19. 7 %) was unable to maintain continuity. All preparations were generally smooth with no sharp angles, and small number of preparations (1. 7 %) had additional retentive features. Conclusions Although students have fresh knowledge about tooth preparation for fixed prosthesis, lack of sufficient preclinical training and their minimal experience affected the quality of tooth preparation especially the convergence angle and finishing line aspects. In spite of large convergence angles, lack of additional retentive features was apparen...|$|R
