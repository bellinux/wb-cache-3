5|$|In September 2013, Rolls-Royce {{announced}} that it had increased the AE-1107C engine's <b>power</b> <b>by</b> 17 percent via {{the adoption of a}} new Block 3 turbine, an increase in fuel valve flow capacity, and accompanying software updates. The upgrade should increase the reliability in high-altitude, high-heat conditions and boost maximum payload limitations from 6,000ft to 8,000ft. A Block 4 upgrade is reportedly being examined, which may increase <b>power</b> <b>by</b> up to 26 percent, producing close to 10,000hp, and improve fuel consumption.|$|E
5|$|After {{boosting}} the trim <b>power</b> <b>by</b> 50 percent, adjusting the aerodynamics, and other modifications, two further mated test flights {{were carried out}} before Schoch {{was able to make}} a successful release and hookup on 14 October 1948. During the fifth free flight on 22 October 1948, Schoch again found it difficult to hook the Goblin to the bomber's trapeze, aborting four attempts before hitting the trapeze bar and breaking the hook on the XF-85's nose. Again, a forced landing was successfully carried out at Muroc.|$|E
