Chris tells Lois that he saw this, so Lois, Peter, Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire track them down at the Barrington Hotel. When they arrive, they see Meg has tied Brian up with <b>packaging</b> <b>tape</b> and is about to rape Brian. Lois tells Meg that she is not {{thinking}} right, although Meg insists that she has never been more sure of anything in her life. Lois struggles to explain and says Meg does not know what she needs, and then Quagmire says (in an erotic tone) [...] "I know what she needs... Bring her by my house around 8:30 tonight I'll take care of her." [...] This implies that he will try to take advantage of Meg and when she arrives at Quagmire's house, it seems even more likely; he tells her to sit down and says [...] "Soon it'll all become clear", puts on seductive music, dims the lights, strips down to a speedo and sits down beside her; but suddenly, Quagmire (uncharacteristically) begins to have a serious heart-to-heart talk with Meg, telling her that her entire life is still ahead of her and she should not be in such a hurry to grow up before assuring her that she will find the right person one day. To help Meg, Quagmire gives her his copy of The Missing Piece to help give her a better perception of things, and sends her away feeling much better. He then walks into his bedroom, where two of his one-night stands await with an array of sex toys, {{and it turns out that}} all of Quagmire's seemingly erotic antics were actually in preparation for this tryst.

40|$|A {{series of}} eight release agent {{solutions}} and emulsions for {{pressure sensitive adhesive}} tapes have been developed. They offer the following unmatched features: water base with no residual solvent, two levels of release, high total solids, dilutable either with water, or acetone (VOC-exempt) and alcohols for fast drying, low-noise unwind, patented urethane technology and cost effectiveness. They provide efficient release from high tack and high adhesion hot-melt PSA’s based on block copolymers used in BOPP-backed <b>packaging</b> <b>tapes,</b> filament tapes and diaper tapes. They are also effective with natural rubber and SBR base PSA’s used in masking tapes and most acrylic PSA’s used in film and cloth-backed tapes. Coater-ready solutions or emulsions are prepared by simply mixing with a diluent, applying on a backing by a conventional coating technique and drying; no curing is involved. Acetone, or acetone-water mixtures, are the choice diluents for coating and printing lines with no solvent recovering capability, or for ones with insufficient capacity for drying water base coatings, since they are fast drying, VOC-free and relatively benign to human health...|$|R

The Mitsubishi FX series programmable logic controller is used to mechanize the system. Sensors such as proximity and load sensor are used to provide the input to the system. The motors, pneumatics, and also the solenoids serve as the output.

40|$|International audienceElastomer based {{pressure}} sensitive adhesives used in various peeling applications are viscoelastic {{and expected to}} be rate sensitive. The effects of varying peel velocity on adhesion energy and its dependence on the peel angle and rate of peeling are investigated. Experiments are conducted on an adhesive tape using a displacement-controlled peel test configuration. By adjusting the peel arm length, the peel velocity can be continuously varied though the extremity {{of the film is}} displaced at a constant rate, which results in nonsteady peeling. Constant peel rate tests are performed over a wide range of peeling rates for a fixed peeling angle, which results in steady state peeling. Based upon the experimental data, a power law relation for the adhesive energy of a <b>packaging</b> <b>tape</b> and its dependence on the rate of peeling is presented. The applicability of the rate dependent law for adhesion energy based upon the steady state experiments to the nonsteady peeling process is critically examined...|$|E
30|$|Cyanoacrylate fuming {{method was}} used to develop latent {{fingerprints}} on bullet casings by Babin (2010). Fieldhouse (2011) suggested the use of cyanoacrylate fuming method for developing both fresh and aged latent fingerprints on smooth and textured plastics. Amata et al. (2015) reported {{a case in which}} cyanoacrylate fuming method {{was used to}} develop latent fingermarks on the trigger of firearm. In another study, the use of cyanoacrylate fuming method was suggested to develop latent fingermarks on the duct tape (Olenik 1984). Tissier et al. (1999) reported a case in which latent fingermarks were developed inside a vehicle by cyanoacrylate fuming method. Vapors of cyanoacrylate were fed into car through a hose and car itself acts as a fumigation chamber. Matthias (2016) used cyanoacrylate fuming method to develop latent fingermarks on both adhesive and non-adhesive sides of different kinds of tapes (black electrical tape, <b>packaging</b> <b>tape,</b> grey duct tape, masking tape) which were previously treated with Un-Du liquid. It was observed that use of Un-Du liquid did not affect the quality of developed prints and also did not interfere in processing of items with cyanoacrylate fuming method. Lam et al. (2014) recommended the sequential processing with cyanoacrylate fuming, vacuum metal deposition and fluorescent dye staining to develop latent fingermarks on Canadian polymer banknotes. They suggested the immediate processing of banknotes with cyanoacrylate fuming in order to minimize the print degradation. In another study, Lam (2014) recommended the use of oblique light to examine and photograph cyanoacrylate developed fingerprints on Canadian polymer banknotes.|$|E
