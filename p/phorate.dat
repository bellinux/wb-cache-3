40|$|Previous {{studies in}} {{euryhaline}} fish {{have shown that}} acclimation to hypersaline environments enhances the toxicity of thioether organophosphate and carbamate pesticides. To better understand the potential mechanism of enhanced toxicity, {{the effects of the}} organophosphate insecticide <b>phorate</b> were evaluated in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) maintained in freshwater (< 0. 5 g/L salinity) and 32 g/L salinity. The observed 96 -h LC 50 in freshwater fish (67. 34 (3. 41 μg/L) was significantly reduced to 2. 07 (0. 16 μg/L in hypersaline-acclimated fish. Because organophosphates often require bioactivation to elicit toxicity through acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, the in vitro biotransformation of <b>phorate</b> was evaluated in coho salmon maintained in different salinities in liver, gills, and olfactory tissues. <b>Phorate</b> sulfoxide was the predominant metabolite in each tissue but rates of formation diminished in a salinity-dependent manner. In contrast, formation of phorate-oxon (gill; olfactory tissues), <b>phorate</b> sulfone (liver), and phorate-oxon sulfoxide (liver; olfactory tissues) was significantly enhanced in fish acclimated to higher salinities. From previous studies, it was expected that <b>phorate</b> and <b>phorate</b> sulfoxide would be less potent AChE inhibitors than phorate-oxon, with phorate-oxon sulfoxide being the most potent of the compounds tested. This trend was confirmed in this study. In summary, these results suggest that differential expression and/or catalytic activities of Phase I enzymes may be involved to enhance <b>phorate</b> oxidative metabolism and subsequent toxicity of <b>phorate</b> to coho salmon under hypersaline conditions. The outcome may be enhanced fish susceptibility to anticholineterase oxon sulfoxides. 1...|$|E

40|$|No {{studies were}} {{identified}} that estimated {{the degree of}} absorption of <b>phorate</b> through the skin following dermal exposure; however, the capacity of <b>phorate</b> to penetrate the skin can be inferred from the findings of acute toxicity studies in rats and {{is supported by the}} predictive algorithm for estimating and evaluating the health hazards of dermal exposure to chemical substances [NIOSH 2009]. The acute dermal toxicity studies in rats [Edson 1960; Gaines 1969] and an occupational exposure study [Kashyap et al. 1984] indicated <b>phorate</b> is highly toxic and potentially fatal in contact with skin, and {{it has the potential to}} cause systemic effects such as ChE inhibition, neurological and gastrointestinal effects, and lethality at low doses following dermal exposure. Although no standard skin irritation tests were identified for animals, a limited number of human patch tests did not indicate that <b>phorate</b> can cause direct skin effects or skin sensitization. Therefore, on the basis of these assessments, <b>phorate</b> is assigned a composite skin notation of SK: SYS (FATAL). Table 3 summarizes the skin hazard designations for <b>phorate</b> previously issued by NIOSH and other organizations.

30|$|The {{experimental}} data {{revealed that the}} toxicity of <b>phorate</b> on early embryonic stages of H. elegans is more sensitive, and it leads to abnormalities of embryos.

Furthermore, the availability of H. elegans throughout the year was favorable and suitable for laboratory toxicity tests. <b>Phorate</b> is an insecticide which has more toxic effects on the early embryonic stages of H. elegans and also leads to environment pollution.|$|E
30|$|In H. elegans, the {{reduction}} in the rotation time in the presence of <b>phorate</b> suggests that the metabolic activity is reduced, as the quantity of the hatching enzyme released {{in the final stages of}} embryonic development may decrease or the secretion process is slowed down.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{recently}} reported {{a link between}} use of the organophosphate pesticide <b>phorate</b> and risk of prostate cancer among applicators with {{a family history of}} prostate cancer in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS). OBJECTIVE: This finding, together with findings of associations between other organophosphate pesticides and cancer more broadly, prompted us to examine <b>phorate</b> exposure and overall cancer incidence in the AHS. Adding 3 years of follow-up and using more detailed exposure information allowed us to see whether the prostate cancer finding held. METHODS: The AHS is a prospective study of licensed restricted-use pesticide applicators from North Carolina and Iowa. To our knowledge, this is the largest examination of workers occupationally exposed to <b>phorate.</b> Pesticide exposure and other information was collected using two selfadministered questionnaires completed from 1993 to 1997. Poisson regression was used to calculate rate ratios (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: <b>Phorate</b> use was not related to the incidence of all cancers combined or to any individual cancer, although we had insufficient numbers to study non-Hodgkin lymphoma or leukemia, which have been linked to organophosphates in other studies. Although prostate cancer risk was not significantly related to <b>phorate</b> use overall or among those without a family history, the risk tended to increase among applicators with a family history of prostate cancer. The interaction RR was 1. 53 (95 % CI, 0. 99 – 2. 37). CONCLUSION: The observed statistical interaction suggests a gene–environment interaction between family history and <b>phorate</b> exposure in the incidence of prostate cancer, but other explanations are also possible...|$|E

40|$|O herbicida {{clomazone}} tem sua seletividade às plantas de arroz aumentada quando as sementes recebem o protetor dietholate. Sabendo que o dietholate atua sobre a atividade da enzima citocromo P- 450 mono-oxigenase e que esta é responsável pela ativação do clomazone, buscam-se outros produtos que possam ser utilizados como protetores. Em vista disso, o objetivo deste experimento foi avaliar o efeito protetor do dietholate e do <b>phorate</b> em função de doses de clomazone. O delineamento experimental foi de blocos ao acaso com quatro repetições, em esquema fatorial. O fator A foi composto pelo tratamento de sementes com dietholate ou <b>phorate,</b> além de uma testemunha, que não recebeu protetor nas sementes. O fator B foi composto por oito doses de clomazone (0, 156, 312, 625, 1. 250, 2. 500, 5. 000 e 10. 000 g i. a. ha- 1). Dezoito dias após a semeadura, foram avaliados a fitotoxicidade, o percentual de redução da estatura e a massa fresca e seca das plantas de arroz. Os dados foram submetidos à análise da variância, por meio da regressão não linear do tipo logístico. Houve diferença entre a testemunha sem protetor e os tratamentos de sementes com os protetores dietholate e <b>phorate.</b> Analisando as curvas de dose-resposta, verifica-se que, quando sementes do cultivar IRGA 417 foram tratadas com dietholate ou com <b>phorate,</b> ambos protegeram as plântulas de arroz do clomazone, ou seja, as plantas foram capazes de tolerar maiores doses de clomazone. Assim, há evidências de que os protetores de plantas dietholate e <b>phorate</b> atuam como inibidores da enzima citocromo P- 450, impedindo que ela ative o clomazone nas plantas de arroz, proporcionando maior seletividade deste herbicida quando comparado à testemunha que não recebeu proteção. Selectivity of Clomazone for rice plants increases when {{seeds are}} treated with the safener dietholate. Considering that dietholate acts on {{the activity of the}} cytochrome P 450 monooxigenase, and that this enzyme also activates the herbicide clomazone, other chemicals capable of acting as safeners should also be sought. Thus, a trial was conducted aiming to evaluate the protective effect of dietholate and <b>phorate</b> against increasing clomazone rates. The trial was carried out in a completely randomized block design, with four replicates in a factorial scheme. Factor A included seeds untreated and treated with dietholate or with <b>phorate.</b> Factor B included eight clomazone rates (0, 156, 312, 625, 1, 250, 2, 500, 5, 000 and 10, 000 g a. i. ha- 1). Plant injury, plant height reduction percentage, fresh mass and dry mass weight were evaluated 18 days after sowing. Data were submitted to analysis of variance by non-linear regression of the logistic type. Significant differences were observed between the control without safener and the treatments with dietholate or <b>phorate.</b> The dose-response curves showed that when rice seeds were treated with either dietholate or <b>phorate,</b> the rice plants were able to tolerate higher rates of clomazone, compared to the untreated control. Thus, this study shows that dietholate and <b>phorate</b> inhibit the enzyme cytochrome P- 450, blocking the activation of clomazone in the rice plants...|$|E
