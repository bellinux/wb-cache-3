5|$|Manufacturers and {{academics}} have conducted studies and experiments {{in an effort}} to improve the stretchiness, melting characteristics, browning, fat content and water retention of <b>pizza</b> <b>cheese.</b> Several patents exist for specialized varieties of <b>pizza</b> <b>cheese</b> and for its processing. A study by Rudan and Barbano found that the addition of a thin layer of vegetable oil atop low- and reduced-fat <b>pizza</b> <b>cheese</b> increased meltability and reduced browning and dehydration when the product was cooked, but the texture remained overly chewy and tough. A study by Perry et al. found various methods to heighten the melt of low-fat <b>pizza</b> <b>cheese</b> by increasing its moisture, including the use of pre-acidification, fat-replacers, and exopolysaccharide starter cultures as well as higher pasteurization temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Mass-produced <b>pizza</b> <b>cheese</b> {{is used by}} the foodservice industry, quick service restaurants, {{and other}} {{industries}} and businesses. The world's largest manufacturer of <b>pizza</b> <b>cheese,</b> Leprino Foods Company, processes 600,000 tonnes (590,000 long tons; 660,000 short tons, 1,322,760,000 pounds) a year. Leprino Foods holds patents for some specialized Mozzarella production processes that enable the quick manufacture of the product. One such product is a frozen shredded cheese used for pizza that is created in a few hours from milk. Other U.S. companies also mass-produce <b>pizza</b> <b>cheese,</b> which is shipped in a frozen state. As of 2000, Glanbia is the largest producer of <b>pizza</b> <b>cheese</b> in Europe. Some retail and commercially mass-produced frozen pizzas have cheese stuffed into the pizza crust.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the {{production}} and consumption of Mozzarella and <b>pizza</b> <b>cheese</b> steadily increased in the mid-20th century, and this trend has continued into {{the first decade of}} the 21st century. In the U.S., several hundred million pounds of <b>pizza</b> <b>cheese</b> is consumed annually. In 1997, it was estimated that annual production of the product was 1 million tons (2 billion pounds) in the United States and 100,000 tonnes (98,000 long tons; 110,000 short tons, 220,460,000 pounds) in Europe. It has been estimated that 30% of all <b>pizza</b> <b>cheese</b> used in the United States is Mozzarella cheese. As of 2000, demand for the product was growing in Europe by 8 percent per year.|$|E

Several studies and experiments have analyzed {{the impact of}} vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, denatured whey proteins and other changes to create ideal and economical pizza cheeses. In 1997, {{it was estimated that}} annual production of <b>pizza</b> <b>cheese</b> products was 2 billion pounds in the United States and 200 million pounds in Europe, and in 2000 demand for the product in Europe was increasing by 8% per year.

5|$|Globally, Mozzarella is {{the most}} popular <b>pizza</b> <b>cheese.</b> However, it has been {{estimated}} that in the United States only 30% of all <b>pizza</b> <b>cheese</b> used is actual Mozzarella. Provolone is the second most popular one. Cheddar may be mixed with Mozzarella to preserve chewiness. Grated Parmesan may be added to the top of a pizza, and typically does not melt well when cooked. A diverse variety of processed pizza cheeses are produced, including analogue cheese. Provel is one example. Other pizza cheeses include Emmental, Romano and Ricotta for calzones or as a topping.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{processed}} <b>pizza</b> <b>cheese</b> is Provel, which uses Cheddar, Swiss, and Provolone cheeses as flavorants. Some analogue types are made with casein, a by-product of milk, and vegetable oil, rather than milk fat. Casein-based Mozzarella-like imitation processed cheeses prepared using rennet are also used as a Mozzarella substitute on frozen pizzas.|$|E
50|$|Low-moisture part-skim mozzarella, {{widely used}} in the food-service industry, has a low {{galactose}} content, per some consumers' preference for <b>cheese</b> on <b>pizza</b> to have low or moderate browning.

5|$|Significant {{amounts of}} <b>pizza</b> <b>cheese</b> {{are used in}} Europe, Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Whole milk mozzarella is popular in pizzas in the East and Southwest regions of the U.S., while one survey showed that Provolone was more popular on {{the east and west}} coast.

5|$|<b>Pizza</b> <b>cheese</b> {{encompasses}} several {{varieties and}} types of cheeses and dairy products that are designed and manufactured for use specifically on pizza. These include processed and modified cheese such as mozzarella-like processed cheeses and mozzarella variants. The term can also refer to any type of cheese suitable for use on pizza. The most popular cheeses used {{in the preparation of}} pizza are mozzarella (accounting for about 30%), provolone, cheddar and Parmesan. Emmental, Romano and ricotta are often used as toppings, and processed pizza cheeses manufactured specifically for pizza are mass-produced. Some mass-produced pizza cheeses are frozen after manufacturing and shipped frozen.|$|E

5|$|In some instances, the {{production}} of analogue <b>pizza</b> <b>cheese</b> can be similar to {{the production}} of cream cheese, although production may be different and homogenization may be avoided. In some varieties, the product is heated to remain at a specific temperature and for a specific amount of time, which causes the proteins in the mix to gelatinize. During this process, salts in the mix serve to emulsify it and thus improve the meltability of the final product. The heated product is then placed in packaging such as bags-in-boxes while still hot, as it is more easily handled in this state compared to when in a solid state. During packaging, these types of pizza cheeses are then quick-cooled to avoid browning of the product, which can occur vis-a-vis the Maillard reaction.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturers aim for a {{moisture}} content of 50-to-52 percent and a fat-in-dry-matter content of 35-to-40 percent. A {{study published in}} the International Journal of Food & Science Technology found that a 12.5:87.5 blend of vetch milk and bovine milk improved stretchiness and melting characteristics. Vetch is a legume that has seeds which are similar to lentils. An experiment published in the International Journal of Dairy Technology suggested that the level of galactose, a monosaccharide sugar that is less sweet than glucose and fructose, can be reduced using different culture techniques. An article in the International Journal of Food Engineering found that trisodium citrate, a food additive used to preserve and add flavor to foods, slightly improved the preferred qualities of <b>pizza</b> <b>cheese.</b> Research published in Dairy Industries International suggested that denatured whey proteins increased moisture retention, but that the improvements were very slight and not economically worthwhile relative to the minor improvements.|$|E
500|$|The International Dictionary of Food and Cooking defines <b>pizza</b> <b>cheese</b> as [...] "a soft spun-curd cheese {{similar to}} Mozzarella made from cow's milk..." [...] that is [...] "...used {{particularly}} for pizzas and contains somewhat less water than real Mozzarella..." [...] Most {{are at least}} 95 percent Mozzarella, with different moisture and fat densities. Cheese for frozen pizzas may be comminuted, in which the cheese is processed into minute granules or fragments. Low-moisture Mozzarella can be formulated specifically for <b>pizza.</b> <b>Cheese</b> may be processed into blocks, from which the product can be grated, made into granules or sliced for use on pizza or other foods. <b>Pizza</b> <b>cheese</b> frequently consists of a blend {{of two or more}} cheeses, such as low-moisture Mozzarella or Provolone. Low-moisture Mozzarella was first manufactured in dairy factories in the Midwestern United States, and was originally called [...] "pizza cheese". Compared to standard Mozzarella, low-moisture Mozzarella has a firmer texture, is easier to grate, has better browning and melting characteristics, and is less perishable.|$|E

500|$|Pasteurized and {{processed}} cheese-like products for pizza that are quicker and cheaper to produce than real cheese {{and designed to}} melt well and remain chewy are used on many mass-produced pizzas in North America and the United Kingdom. These products {{are referred to as}} analogue (or analog) pizza cheese; in the UK the term [...] "cheese analogue" [...] is used, making clear that it is not actually cheese. In the book Technology of Cheesemaking, [...] editors Law and Tamimethat state that analogue <b>pizza</b> <b>cheese</b> appears to be the leading type of cheese analogue produced globally. Each year in the United States, 700 million frozen pizzas are sold, three-quarters of which contain cheese substitutes.|$|E
