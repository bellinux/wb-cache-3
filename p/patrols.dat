5|$|In October 1941 the LRDG was {{expanded}} to 10 <b>patrols</b> {{by the simple}} method of splitting the existing <b>patrols</b> into two-half patrols; the New Zealanders formed A Squadron comprising 'R1', 'R2', 'T1', and 'T2' <b>Patrols</b> and the British and Rhodesians formed B Squadron comprising 'G1', 'G2', 'S1', 'S2', 'Y1', and 'Y2' <b>Patrols.</b> The 'H' Patrol had been disbanded in September 1941 after three months service.|$|E
5|$|After {{this the}} commandos came up against {{part of the}} Siegfried Line defences around Roermond. A short halt {{followed}} and during this time No. 6 Commando sent {{out a number of}} <b>patrols</b> mounted on the tanks of the 8th Hussars. In February, the snow thawed and the ground turned to mud which rendered the tanks useless and as a result the commandos carried out their <b>patrols</b> on foot.|$|E
5|$|Discussions about <b>patrols</b> {{remained}} complicated. Britain and France {{offered to}} replace Germany and Italy in <b>patrols</b> of their sections, but the latter powers believed these <b>patrols</b> {{would be too}} partial. Germany and Italy requested that land controls be kept, and belligerent rights {{be given to the}} Nationalists, so that rights of search could be used by both the Republicans and Nationalists to replace naval <b>patrols.</b> The French considered abandoning border controls, or perhaps leaving non-intervention. However, the French were reliant on the British, who wished to continue with <b>patrols.</b> Britain and France thus continued to labour over non-intervention; whilst they judged it effective, some 42 ships were estimated to have escaped inspection between April and the end of July. The air route had not been covered. The Nationalists' debt to Germany reached 150 million Reichmarks. On 9 July, the Dutch Ambassador suggested that Britain draft a compromise. Lord Plymouth did, called the 'compromise plan for the control of non-intervention'. Naval <b>patrols</b> would be replaced by observers in ports and ships, land control measures would be resumed. Belligerent rights would only be granted when substantial progress was made on volunteer withdrawal. The French were furious, considering that Britain was moving towards Germany and Italy. Grandi demanded the discussion of belligerent rights before volunteer rights; Maisky insisted that volunteers be discussed first.|$|E

In September 1951 Belfast provided anti-aircraft cover for a salvage operation to recover a crashed enemy MiG-15 jet fighter. She conducted further bombardments and <b>patrols</b> before receiving a month's leave from operations, returning to action on 23 December.|$|E
5|$|Each troop {{is divided}} into <b>patrols</b> of eight or so Scouts led by a patrol leader elected from within the patrol. Patrol {{meetings}} are generally held during the weekly troop meeting. The patrol's independence from the troop varies among troops and between activities. Patrols' autonomy becomes more visible at campouts, where each patrol may set up its own camping and cooking area. Divisions between <b>patrols</b> may disappear during an event which {{only a small part}} of the troop attends. <b>Patrols</b> may hold meetings and even excursions separately from the rest of the troop.|$|E

5000|$|... 6-8 Scouts {{make up a}} <b>patrol.</b> The <b>patrol</b> is {{the main}} unit of the Scout {{programme}} and most activities are done in the <b>patrol.</b> The <b>patrol</b> is led by an older Scout known as a <b>patrol</b> leader (pl). He is helped by an assistant <b>patrol</b> leader. All {{other members of the}} <b>patrol</b> are given jobs (e.g. cook, first aider, scribe).

30|$|Typically, a city is {{partitioned}} into command districts or precincts. Each command district {{usually has}} a headquarters and a commanding officer {{to manage and}} supervise the police <b>patrol</b> operations. Each command district is further divided into several beats or sectors [4]. Police can effectively manage their operations through {{the design of the}} command districts and the choice of <b>patrol</b> strategies of the police units within those districts. There are three major types of <b>patrol</b> strategies for <b>patrol</b> officers: active <b>patrol,</b> random <b>patrol,</b> and directed <b>patrol.</b> In active <b>patrol,</b> <b>patrol</b> officers should use every opportunity to discover, detect, observe, and interdict the unusual event. Random <b>patrol</b> means <b>patrol</b> routes should be random and varied so that the <b>patrol</b> behaviors will not be predicted by potential criminals. In directed <b>patrol,</b> <b>patrol</b> officers pay more efforts to hotspots of crime so they can respond quickly and reduce the crimes in hotspots. In practice, <b>patrol</b> officers may choose one strategy or combine them to accommodate the specific conditions in their area [3]. Another important <b>patrol</b> principle is beat integrity. <b>Patrol</b> officer is expected to remain within assigned <b>patrol</b> district. Beat integrity can be absolute or relative, depending on the number of <b>patrol</b> units assigned {{and the size of the}} <b>patrol</b> district and the activity within the area [3]. For absolute beat integrity, <b>patrol</b> officers should remain in the assigned <b>patrol</b> district at all times. In relative beat integrity, <b>patrol</b> officers remain largely within the <b>patrol</b> area and leave it only for good reason, such as back up another officer or respond to a call for service (CFS) incident in another <b>patrol</b> district [3]. When there is a CFS incident, many police departments use the principle that “the nearest police car responds to the call”, which belongs to the case of relative beat integrity.|$|R
5|$|In December 1943, the LRDG re-organised {{into two}} squadrons of eight <b>patrols.</b> Each patrol {{contained}} one officer and 10 other ranks. Major Moir Stormonth Darling was given {{command of the}} British Squadron and Major Kenneth Henry Lazarus the Rhodesian Squadron. <b>Patrols</b> were then parachuted north of Rome to obtain information about German troop movements, and also carried out raids on the Dalmatian Islands and Corfu.|$|E
5|$|In November 1940, the LRP was reorganised and re-designated the Long Range Desert Group. It was {{expanded}} to six Patrols: 'T','W' and 'R' <b>Patrols</b> {{were joined by}} 'G', 'S' and 'Y' <b>Patrols.</b> Each patrol was expected {{to belong to the}} same regimental group, but only the Brigade of Guards and the Yeomanry regiments formed their own <b>Patrols,</b> 'G' and 'Y' respectively. The men of 'G' Patrol were drawn from the 3rd Battalion Coldstream Guards and the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards under command of Captain Michael Crichton-Stuart. The 'Y' Patrol men were drawn from the Nottinghamshire Yeomanry under command Captain P. J. D. McCraith, with additional men from the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. In December 1940, 'W' Patrol was disbanded and its personnel used to bring 'R' and 'T' <b>Patrols</b> up to strength, while 'G' Patrol took over their vehicles. By June 1941 the LRDG was re-organised into two squadrons: the New Zealand and Rhodesian 'A' Squadron with 'S', 'T' and 'R' <b>Patrols,</b> and 'B' Squadron with 'G', 'H' and 'Y' <b>Patrols.</b> There was also a Headquarters Section along with signals, survey and light repair sections. A Heavy section, initially equipped with four 6-ton Marmon-Herrington trucks, was used to provide logistical support by transporting supplies to bases and setting up hidden replenishment points at pre-arranged locations. In addition, there was an Air Section, using Waco ZGC-7 and YKC biplanes that transported key personnel, evacuated wounded and performed other liaison tasks.|$|E
5|$|Some troops {{establish}} Venture <b>patrols</b> as {{an optional}} program for boys thirteen through seventeen years old. Venture <b>patrols</b> experience more autonomy from the troop than ordinary <b>patrols,</b> and provide older Scouts with expanded social contact and physical challenges.

Venture patrol members wear the standard Boy Scout uniform with the Venture strip over the right pocket. Patrol members are Boy Scouts and should never be referred to as Venture Scouts.|$|E
