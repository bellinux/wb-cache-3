Some of the main parameters to be considered while designing parametric arrays are <b>primary</b> <b>frequencies,</b> secondary frequencies, transducer array size, transmitted power and the overall system complexity. Choice of these parameters is contradictory and has to be chosen as a compromise between their effects.

40|$|Bubbles can {{dramatically}} {{change the}} acoustic properties of their host medium {{even if they}} are present in very small amounts. This paper describes the combination-frequency component of tank and field measurements taken using a device which measures bubbles in marine sediments using multiple acoustic techniques (allowing the results of the various techniques to be compared). The combination-frequency method uses the nonlinear scattering property of bubbles when insonified by two <b>primary</b> <b>frequencies.</b> For low void fractions, there is a monotonic relationship between the scattered field and the population of bubbles resonant at either of the <b>primary</b> <b>frequencies</b> or combination of these and-slash or their subharmonics. This principle is used to infer the bubble size distribution. In contrast to the case of gas bubbles in water, in marine sediments the shear properties of the host medium must be incorporated into the model for the bubble dynamics and a new model for this is presented. This model is then inverted to obtain the bubble size distribution. The predictions of this method were compared with the method of inversion of propagation data (detailed in a companion paper), obtained from in situ experiments on the South coast of England. © 2008 Acoustical Society of Americ...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{evidence}} implicates outer {{hair cells}} (OHC) as {{being responsible for}} the generation of distortion products (DP) in cochlear mechanics. Forces exerted on the basilar membrane by OHCs must saturate at high levels and, thereby, become {{a major source of}} nonlinearity. Realistic growth of distortion products requires that the saturation of OHC forces (with increasing level) be gradual. The apparent band-pass filtering of the distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) observed in ear canal sound pressure can be explained as the combination of two effects. (1) The DPOAE becomes smaller as the <b>primary</b> <b>frequencies</b> are separated because the basilar membrane vibration becomes smaller at the place where the two tones interact. (2) The DPOAE becomes smaller as the <b>primary</b> <b>frequencies</b> are brought closer together because reflected energy from the DP place partially cancels the retrograde signal. This explanation does not require the presence of any “second filter ” in the mechanics of the cochlear partition. With a nonlinear, active model of cochlear mechanics, we have explored whether a simulated hearing loss at the DP frequency can influence the apparent band-pass filtering of DPs, which are generated primarily at the f 2 place. Results of this simulation are compared with DP measurements from a subject with low-frequency hearing loss. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{propagation}} of bichromatic wave groups over a constant 1 : 100 beach slope {{and the influence}} of the group modulation is presented. The modulation is controlled by varying the group frequency, fg, which is shown to remarkably affect the energy transfer to high and low frequency components. The growth of the high frequency (hf) wave skewness increases when fg decreases. This is explained by nonlinear coupling between the <b>primary</b> <b>frequencies,</b> which results in a larger growth of hf components as fg decreases, causing the hf waves to break earlier. Due to high spatial resolution, wave tracking has provided an accurate measurement of the varying breakpoint. These breaking locations are very well described (math formula) by the wave-height to effective-depth ratio (γ). However, for any given Iribarren number, this γ is shown to increase with fg. Therefore, a modified Iribarren number is proposed to include the grouping structure, leading to a considerable improvement in reproducing the measured γ-values. Within the surf zone, the behavior of the Incident Long Wave also depends on the group modulation. For low fg conditions, the lf wave decays only slightly by transferring energy back to the hf wave components. However, for high fg wave conditions, strong dissipation of low frequency (lf) components occurs close to the shoreline associated with lf wave breaking. This mechanism is explained by the growth of the lf wave height, induced partly by the self-self interaction of fg, and partly by the nonlinear coupling between the <b>primary</b> <b>frequencies</b> and fg...|$|R

40|$|Distortion-product otoacoustic {{emissions}} (DPOAEs) are sounds {{detected in}} the ear canal which are generated by the nonlinear processes in the inner ear (cochlea) {{in response to the}} external stimulation of two or more tones (primaries). Their generation region in the cochlea can be systematically changed by varying the <b>primary</b> <b>frequencies,</b> and they are currently being evaluated for possible clinical use in screening for hearing defects. The phase and amplitude of various orders of DPOAEs of frequencies, fdp=f 1 -n(f 2 -f 1), (n= 1, 2,. ̇.), were measured in human subjects for two-tone stimuli of frequencies f 1 and f 2 (3 ̆ef 1). A number of experimental paradigms (fixed primary ratio f 2 /f 1, fixed f 1, fixed f 2, and fixed fdp) were used to investigate the nature of peaks and valleys (fine structure) of DPOAEs in their phase and amplitude dependence on the <b>primary</b> <b>frequencies.</b> This fine structure {{must be taken into account}} in any potential clinical applications of DPOAEs. The experimental results largely support a model in which the fine structure stems from interference at the base of the cochlea between distortion product (DP) components coming from the primary DPOAE source region (around the f 2 tonotopic place) and components coming from the DP tonotopic place (via reflection of an apically moving DP wave). The spectral periodicity of the fine structures for several orders of apical DPOAEs corresponds to a tonotopic displacement of about 0. 4 mm along the basilar membrane (BM) (0. 4 bark). In agreement with the reaction model, this spectral spacing is also characteristic of synchronous evoked and spontaneous otoacoustic emission spectra as well as the microstructure of the hearing threshold. Approximate analytic expressions for the mechanisms which are responsible for the fine structure are used to interpret the data. ...|$|R

In October 2013 and March 2015 the NIST-F2 caesium fountain clock reported a uB of 1.5 × 10−16 in the BIPM reports of evaluation of <b>primary</b> <b>frequency</b> standards. However, the uncertainty evaluation of NIST-F2's frequency shift due to distributed cavity phase, which currently limits many other accurate atomic fountain clocks, had a shortcoming {{that makes it}} difficult to assign an accuracy until this error is re-evaluated. In addition, the largest systematic error of NIST-F2 is a microwave amplitude dependent frequency shift, which includes frequency shifts due to the microwave lensing of atomic wave-packets by microwave dipole forces on the atoms and microwave leakage. An independent statistical analysis of the NIST measurements showed that this uncertainty was significantly too small and should be increased from 0.8 × 10−16 to at least 1.5 × 10−16. As a result, the quoted uncertainty of NIST-F2 would increase to approximately 1.7 × 10−16, if the re-evaluation of the uncertainty due to distributed cavity phase shows that it is small. The March, 2015 report to the BIPM did not address the published criticism and there have been neither subsequent reports to the BIPM nor has an updated accuracy evaluation been published.|$|E

The wave train from the Chilean tsunami lasted {{for at least four}} days due to multipath arrivals that may not have included reflections from outside the bay but most likely did include secondary undulations, and energy trapping in the form of edge waves, inside the bay. The SSA decomposition resolved oscillations with periods of 52 - 57, 34 - 35, 26 - 27, and 21 - 22 minutes, all frequencies that have been predicted and/or observed in previous studies. The EEMD decomposition detected oscillations with periods of 50 - 55 and 21 - 22 minutes. Periods in the range of 50 - 57 minutes varied due to measurement uncertainties but almost certainly correspond to the first longitudinal mode of oscillation for Monterey Bay, periods of 34 - 35 minutes correspond to the first transverse mode of oscillation that assumes a nodal line across the entrance of the bay, a period of 26 - 27 minutes, although previously observed, may not represent a fundamental oscillation, and a period of 21 - 22 minutes has been predicted and observed previously. A period of ~ 37 minutes, close to the period of 34 - 35 minutes, was generated by the Great Alaskan Earthquake of 1964 in Monterey Bay and most likely represents the same mode of oscillation. The tsunamis associated with the Great Alaskan Earthquake and the Chilean Earthquake both entered Monterey Bay but initially arrived outside the bay from opposite directions. Unlike the Great Alaskan Earthquake, however, which excited only one resonant mode inside the bay, the Chilean Earthquake excited several modes suggesting that the asymmetric shape of the entrance to Monterey Bay was an important factor and that the directions of the incoming tsunami-generated waves were most likely different...|$|R

For this reason Implicit Large Eddy Simulation (ILES) approach was used in combination with high order, high resolution numerical methods. The numerical methods examined are a 2 nd order Monotonic Upwind Scheme for Scalar Conservation Laws (MUSCL) with Van Leer limiter, a high order (3 rd) interpolation and a 5 th order Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory scheme (WENO). First the numerical data for three low (steady state) Reynolds numbers and for two unsteady (in the form of <b>primary</b> <b>frequencies)</b> were compared to the experimental data and were found in good agreement. A grid convergence study was undertaken for two Reynolds numbers demonstrating grid convergence and justifying {{the selection of the}} grid. The three numerical methods were evaluated for two Reynolds numbers showing good agreement for Reynolds number 412 and discrepancies at Reynolds number 900 between MUSCL and WENO with the MUSCL demonstrating a very dissipative behavior. The physical behavior of the flow {{in a wide range of}} Reynolds numbers were examined. For this range the flow behavior changed from steady to unsteady laminar and finally exhibiting localized transition to turbulence. The behavior of the main recirculation areas was described and the vortex shedding that occur there and how this change with the Reynolds number. The flow was observed to change from an unsteady quasi three dimensional flow at Reynolds number 412 to an increased transitional state with three dimensional vortical structures at Reynolds number 550.
