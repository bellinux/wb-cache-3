25|$|The first large {{precision}} machine tool was the cylinder boring machine used for boring the large-diameter cylinders on early steam engines. The <b>planing</b> <b>machine,</b> the milling machine and the shaping machine were developed {{in the early decades}} of the 19th century. Although the milling machine was invented at this time, it was not developed as a serious workshop tool until somewhat later in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The dock {{maintenance}} workshops {{are also}} survivors from the 1880s but were extended {{in the early}} 20th century. The brick building is topped with a tiled double-pile hipped roof with corbelled eaves. It has sliding doors at each end, giving access to the boiler and engine houses, blacksmith's and engineer's shops. Much of the original machinery survives, including steam-powered plant from the mid-1880s, these include a Whitworth <b>planing</b> <b>machine,</b> a Whitworth slotting machine, punching-and-shearing machines, a long-bed lathe and a steam hammer. There is also wall-mounted line-shafting and a Tangye horizontal engine and Cornish boiler.|$|E
25|$|Murray also {{patented}} {{an automatic}} damper that controlled the furnace draft {{depending on the}} boiler pressure, and he designed a mechanical hopper that automatically fed fuel to the firebox. Murray {{was the first to}} adopt the placing of the piston in a horizontal position in the steam engine. He expected very high standards of workmanship from his employees, and the result was that Fenton, Murray and Wood produced machinery of a very high precision. He designed a special <b>planing</b> <b>machine</b> for planing the faces of the slide valves. Apparently this machine was kept in a locked room, to which only certain employees were allowed access.|$|E

5000|$|After {{spending}} {{years working}} around wood, Woodworth would design and then patent the Woodworth <b>Planing</b> <b>Machine</b> in 1828. [...] Hailed {{as the greatest}} improvement to the <b>planing</b> <b>machine</b> so far {{and one of the}} most important inventions of the century, it added speed and efficiency to the process of creating lumber for domestic usage. [...] The invention could perform the output of 25 laborers, cheapened finished lumber, and greatly increased the supply. In 1829, the Franklin Institute praised the invention. [...] The United States Congress would praise the invention in 1850 along with Eli Whitney's Cotton Gin as the great labor savings inventions of the country.|$|E
5000|$|Latta's first {{jobs were}} for David Bradford Woolen Mills, Samuel Cummings' brass foundry, and William Bylad's machine shop. Latta met Anthony Harkness, {{owner of a}} foundry and machine shop in Cincinnati, while on a {{business}} trip to Washington, D. C. in 1841. He explained to Harkness his mechanical ability and about his invention for a machine that would make parts for steamboat paddle wheels. He made such an impression on Harkness that he was offered a job as a superintendent of Harkness's foundry. His first assignment was that of designing a huge lathe and <b>planing</b> <b>machine</b> for Harkness. The inventor George Escol Sellers believed the <b>planing</b> <b>machine</b> was a mechanical masterpiece.|$|E

50|$|The Woodworth <b>planing</b> <b>machine</b> had {{a direct}} impact on patent law in the United States. Because Woodworth and his heirs {{repeatedly}} attempted, and succeeded many times in having the patent extended by Congress, it was attacked politically as a monopoly. Woodworth's heirs were subjected to one of the earlier special interest, community organizing campaigns in the country, as lumber merchants and carpenters, growing tired of paying a royalty to Woodworth's heirs, mounted a public campaign to have the extension of the patent blocked.|$|E
50|$|A {{cheese factory}} {{was built in}} Pittston in the late-1800s. By 1885, an {{addition}} {{was added to the}} cheese factory which housed a grain crusher and <b>planing</b> <b>machine,</b> diversifying operations. The cheese factory burned down twice, once in the late-1800s and once in 1900, and was rebuilt after both fires. By 1900, the factory had reached its peak, producing 20 cheeses a day. The cheese was transported to Spencerville where it was then shipped to Montreal to be exported internationally. The factory closed in the 1940s.|$|E

40|$|Pyrolytic carbon (PyC) is {{extremely}} biocompatible with high directional strength and unique directional thermal conductivity. PyC {{is used in}} biomedical devices like cardiovascular implants and finger prosthesis. Microfeatures on PyC have been proven as performance-driving agents in many cases. This work is focused on micro-electric discharge machining (micro-EDM) characterization of PyC to understand the effect of material/thermal anisotropy on the process response. An L 9 Taguchi design of experiments has been performed to analyze the effect of gap voltage, capacitance, and frequency on the MRR, surface quality, and dimensional accuracy. MRR increases by 16 % with vibration in AB <b>plane</b> <b>machining.</b> In C <b>plane,</b> the effect of vibration on MRR is not favorable. MRR reduces by 56 % if the <b>machining</b> <b>plane</b> changes from AB to C due to the lower thermal conductivity along C. Surface roughness decreases by {{an order of magnitude}} if <b>machining</b> <b>plane</b> changes from AB to C; surface roughness of 65 nm has been achieved in C plane under certain conditions. The error in dimensional accuracy in C plane is 46 % lower than AB plane. EDS shows noncontaminated machined surface. Finally, micro-EDM process has been used to create microfeatures in PyC, which could potentially improve/alter the desired surface quality...|$|R
