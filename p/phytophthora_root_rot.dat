40|$|<b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> <b>rots</b> are an {{important}} consideration {{in the production of}} container-grown plants in Western Australia. They are present and have been present in a majority of production nurseries for many years. However, with a good understanding of the factors that predispose plants to <b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> <b>rots,</b> it is possible to avoid the problem. It is important for the producer and purchaser {{to be aware of the}} plant production methods that favour the survival, pathogenicity and spread of Phytophthora species under some conditions in the nursery and at the point of end use (home garden, horticulture, forestry and revegetation) ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> of papaya {{seedlings}} is {{most serious}} during rainy periods. Under waterlogged conditions, P. palmivora may attack roots of papaya older than three-months of age, {{the time at}} which they become resistant to the pathogen under normal conditions. Therefore, <b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> may occur on papaya at any age in poorly drained areas. Waterlogged conditions appear to weaken the defense mechanism of papaya roots against invasion by the pathogen. Mobility of zoospores of P. palmivora under such conditions also {{may contribute to the}} severity of the disease due to their attraction by papaya roots.|$|E
50|$|It also grows {{well in the}} cool, wet summers {{of western}} Ireland and England, and {{temperate}} regions of Europe and Asia. Pests include scales and thrips, and diseases include anthracnose, <b>Phytophthora,</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot,</b> and rust.|$|E
50|$|Rhododendrons are {{susceptible}} to vine weevil, rhododendron and azalea whiteflies, leafhoppers, lacebugs, scale insects, caterpillars, aphids, powdery mildew, bud blast, honey fungus, rust, leafy gall, petal blight, silver leaf, <b>phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> and lime-induced chlorosis.|$|E
40|$|<b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> and crown <b>rots</b> (sometimes called collar rot) {{are common}} and {{destructive}} diseases of fruit trees throughout the world. In Ohio, apple, cherry, and peach trees are usually attacked. Pear and plum trees {{appear to be}} relatively resistant. Trees declining and dying from <b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> and crown <b>rots</b> are frequently misdiagnosed as suffering from “wet feet ” (root asphyxiation) or are sometimes confused with those suffering from winter injury...|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} issues of fungal infection. Fungal species cause stem <b>rot</b> (<b>Phytophthora</b> spp.) and <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> (Rhizoctonia spp.) that can {{ultimately}} cause plant death but {{can usually be}} controlled by adequate drainage.|$|R

50|$|Like {{many other}} parts of Tasmania, this area is {{susceptible}} to <b>Phytophthora</b> (<b>root</b> <b>rot).</b> To avoid spreading it, walkers are encouraged to stay to the main trail. In order to reduce mechanical damage to plants, walkers are also encouraged to wade through the middle of muddy track sections.|$|E
50|$|Four species (C. lawsoniana, C. obtusa, C. pisifera, and C. thyoides) are of {{considerable}} importance as ornamental trees in horticulture; several hundred cultivars {{have been selected}} for various traits, including dwarf size, yellow, blue, silvery or variegated foliage, permanent retention of juvenile leaves, and thread-like shoots with reduced branching. In some areas, cultivation is limited by <b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> diseases, with C. lawsoniana being particularly susceptible to P. lateralis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> {{was first}} {{reported}} in the blueberry plant in 1963. In plants surveyed in North Carolina {{it was found that}} 40% of plants were infected. Symptoms of root rot include yellowing or reddening of leaves, heavy defoliation, and stunted plant growth. Today current USDA estimates are that 80% of eastern blueberry acres are infected with root rot and {{it has the potential to}} reduce yields by up to 25%.|$|E
5000|$|Poncirus trifoliata: it {{is a close}} {{relative}} of the Citrus genus, sometimes classified as Citrus trifoliata. It is especially resistant to cold, the tristeza virus, and the fungus <b>Phytophthora</b> parasitica (<b>root</b> <b>rot)</b> and grows well in loam soil. Among its disadvantages are its slow growth—it is the slowest growing rootstock—and its poor resistance to heat and drought. It is primarily used in China, Japan, and areas of California with heavy soils.|$|R

40|$|Greenhouse {{studies were}} {{performed}} to determine the reactions of 10 “California Wonder” (Capsicum annuum) accessions to the three forms of <b>Phytophthora</b> blight (<b>root</b> <b>rot,</b> stem blight and foliar blight) caused by Phytophthora capsici. Differences in <b>root</b> <b>rot,</b> stem blight and foliar blight severities among accessions were significant. The accessions consistently differentiated into two groups across the three disease syndromes. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers showed variability both within and between accessions of California Wonder. The variability in {{the responses to the}} three forms of Phytophthora blight does not warrant its usefulness as a standard susceptible control in studies involving the Capsicum-P. capsici patho-system...|$|R
50|$|Cultural {{practice}} {{is also important}} {{in the management of}} Phytophthora diseases of papaya. Incidence of <b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> of mature trees in waterlogged areas during the rainy periods can be greatly reduced by improving drainage in the orchards. Infected fruit on the trees and those that have fallen to the ground should be removed to reduce the inoculum for aerial infection of fruit and stems, and infection of seedling roots in subsequent plantings.|$|E
50|$|In {{the face}} of urban development, {{inappropriate}} fire management, and invasive alien trees such as pines and gums, silvertrees have been driven from about 74% of their natural range. Mortality of these short-lived trees is negligible after a burn, but then increases to about 5% per annum. During a longer term absence of burns however, sudden die-offs may occur, even {{in a matter of}} hours. This {{is believed to be the}} combined result of (warm) berg winds and diseased roots which are weakened by <b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> which inhibits their water absorption.|$|E
50|$|Lima bean agar (LBA) {{is a kind}} of agar medium {{which is}} used to {{cultivate}} the spore of Phytophthora sojae. Phytophthora sojae causes soybean blight (<b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> of soybeans). Soybean blight can affect the output and quality of soybeans seriously. The spore of phytophthora sojae is difficult to culture in potato dextrose agar; it is generally cultured by lima bean agar and carrot agar. Lima bean agar can cultivate, separate, reproduce and conserve many kinds spore of phytophthora sojae, but it is not suitable for cultivating the pathogen of potato late blight.|$|E
40|$|Caused by a soil-borne, fungus-like {{organism}} (<b>Phytophthora),</b> {{crown and}} <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> occurs worldwide on almost all fruit trees.

5000|$|Maples are {{affected}} {{by a number of}} fungal diseases. Several are susceptible to Verticillium wilt caused by Verticillium species, which can cause significant local mortality. Sooty bark disease, caused by Cryptostroma species, can kill trees that are under stress due to drought. Death of maples can rarely be caused by <b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> and Ganoderma root decay. Maple leaves in late summer and autumn are commonly disfigured by [...] "tar spot" [...] caused by Rhytisma species and mildew caused by Uncinula species, though these diseases do not usually have an adverse effect on the trees' long-term health.|$|E
50|$|In alfalfa, A. eutiches is {{especially}} damaging {{in conjunction with}} Phytophthora medicaginis, which causes <b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> (PRR) in alfalfa. After initial studies in Wisconsin, A. euteiches was identified as an economically significant alfalfa pathogen in other states as well. In Wisconsin, Iowa and Kentucky it often exceeds P. medicaginis in prevalence in fields where alfalfa is grown. Due to these diseases, conventional advice was to avoid growing alfalfa in any wet soils. However, {{with the development of}} ARR- and PRR-resistant varieites, wet soil conditions have become less of a concern for alfalfa production, {{at least as far as}} disease pressure is concerned. Today, modern alfalfa varieties are required to have both PRR and ARR resistance.|$|E
50|$|Owing {{to later}} {{suburban}} sprawl in Southern California, the mother tree stood {{for many years}} in front of a residence in La Habra Heights. The tree died when it was 76 years old and was cut down on 11 September 2002 after a ten-year fight with <b>phytophthora</b> (<b>root</b> <b>rot),</b> which often kills avocado trees. Two plaques by the private residence at 426 West Road mark the spot where it grew. The wood was stored in a tree nursery and from this stock, a nephew of Rudolph Hass, Dick Stewart, made keepsakes, jewelry and other gifts. From 2010 to 2013, in mid-May, the city of La Habra Heights celebrated the Hass avocado at its Annual La Habra Heights Avocado Festival.|$|E
40|$|Phosphite {{controls}} many {{plant diseases}} caused by Phytophthora, even at concentrations in planta which only partially inhibit pathogen growth in vitro. It is unique among fungicides {{in that it}} is translocated in both the xylem and phloem. This property, along with their good water solubility, enables them to be applied to tree crops by trunk injection, aerial application or backpack spray units for the control of <b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> <b>rots.</b> One of the consequences of phosphite treatment is that it induces a strong and rapid defence response in the challenged plant. These defence responses stop pathogen spread in a large number of hosts. The Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM) in Western Australia has conducted research• on the potential of phosphite to control Phytophthora spp. in a few plant species. Recent work completed at Murdoch University in conjuction with Alcoa of Australia Ltd and CALM has indicated that some plants (i) vary in their response to phosphite as the concentration increases, (ii) are affected by and recover from phytotoxicity in different ways and time periods, (iii) distribute phosphite differently within the plant, and (iv) sometimes reduce flowering and seed set. A series of trials are currently being conducted to investigate these points on a range of native plant species from different areas within Western Australia...|$|R

40|$|<b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> and crown <b>rot</b> {{has been}} {{traditionally}} considered a minor disease of olive. However, {{in recent years}} it has been recognized as an emerging problem in several olive-growing countries such as Australia, Italy and Spain probably {{as a consequence of}} the expansion of plantings in new areas with heavy soils and the more intensive use of irrigation in both olive nurseries and commercial groves. The disease has been reported from most olive-growing countries and is caused by several soil -borne species of Phytophthora, including P. cinnamomi, P. citricola, P. cryptogea, P. drechsleri, P. gonapodyides, P. inundata, P. megasperma,P. nicotianae and P. palmivora. Diagnosis is currently based on the isolation and identification of isolates by both traditional and molecular methods. New molecular techniques are currently available that could be applied for both the identification of isolates and Phytophthora infections directly in host-tissues as well as insoil and water samples. A number of dedicated databases could improve the efficiency of these techniques. Moreover, DNA analysis has greatly contributed to phylogenetic studies of Phytophthora. Control of <b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> and crown <b>rot</b> of olive is mainly based on preventive measures...|$|R
5000|$|The {{rootstock}} {{that the}} cherry is grafted onto {{can play a}} significant role in the disease symptoms seen. Rootstocks of Mahaleb cherry exhibit different symptoms from stocks of Colt, Mazzard, or Stockton Morello. When the scion is grafted onto Mahaleb, symptoms consistent with <b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> can be seen. To distinguish between root rot and x-disease the wood under the bark at the graft union should be examined. If it is x-disease the wood at the union will have grooves and pits this causes a browning of the phloem and shows the cells in decline. This rapid decline is caused by the rootstock cells near the graft union dying in large quantities. Foliage begins to turn yellow and the curl upward and inward toward the leaf midrib. Trees infected with Mahaleb rootstock die by late summer or early the following year.|$|E
50|$|Raspberries {{are grown}} for the fresh fruit market and for {{commercial}} processing into {{individually quick frozen}} (IQF) fruit, purée, juice, or as dried fruit used {{in a variety of}} grocery products. Traditionally, raspberries were a midsummer crop, but with new technology, cultivars, and transportation, they can now be obtained year-round. Raspberries need ample sun and water for optimal development. Raspberries thrive in well-drained soil with a pH between 6 and 7 with ample organic matter to assist in retaining water. While moisture is essential, wet and heavy soils or excess irrigation can bring on <b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot,</b> {{which is one of the}} most serious pest problems facing the red raspberry. As a cultivated plant in moist, temperate regions, it is easy to grow and has a tendency to spread unless pruned. Escaped raspberries frequently appear as garden weeds, spread by seeds found in bird droppings.|$|E
50|$|In {{the past}} and recently, trunk {{injection}} of pesticides and plant resistance activators has been investigated in agriculture for control of pathogens and insect pests on fruit tree crops and grapevines. The most investigated are diseases and pests of avocado, apple, and grapevine, such as <b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> of avocado Phytophthora cinnamomi and avocado thrips Scirtothrips perseae, fire blight Erwinia amylovora and apple scab Venturia inaequalis, oblique banded leaf roller Choristoneura rosaceana and codling moth Cydia pomonella, and grapevine downy mildew Plasmopara viticola and powdery mildew Uncinula necator. Apple trees are especially interesting as a research model in agriculture since {{it is known that}} apple production requires intensive spray schedules for control of pathogenic fungus V. inaequalis with as many as 15-22 sprays of fungicides per season in humid climate. Hence, trunk injection of pesticides is considered as an option for precise compound delivery which will reduce the negative impact of drift-driven pesticide losses in the environment, that occur after each spraying. Besides negative consequences of frequent pesticide applications in the environment, stem injection of grapevines is investigated in viticulture for control of pathogens with difficult biologies which infect and destroy woody tissues and that cannot be controlled efficiently by canopy spray applications of fungicides. To increase the efficiency of injected compounds in trees and vines, important considerations are plant anatomy, weather and soil conditions, tree physiology processes, spatial and temporal distribution of injected compound, and the chemical properties of injected compound and formulation.|$|E
40|$|Sudden death {{syndrome}} (SDS) generally strikes soybean {{around the}} middle of August in Iowa. Because of the unusual weather this growing season, the disease is showing up much earlier and was reported last week from several southern Iowa counties. The fields that we visited last week had several disease patches in poor drainage areas. Plants in these areas showed intervienal necrosis on leaves and <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> symptoms. The lower portion of stems, when they were split, was gray. In some plants, bluish fungal colonies could {{be seen on the}} roots, but these colonies were not as common as in plants later in the summer. <b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> and stem <b>rot</b> also was coexisting with SDS in these fields...|$|R
40|$|Soybean cyst {{nematode}} (SCN) causes the greatest yield loss of any single pathogen of soybean in Iowa. An estimated 50 million bushels {{were lost in}} Iowa to SCN in 2004. Damage from SCN {{is not limited to}} yield loss from root feeding; SCN also makes other diseases like sudden death syndrome, iron deficiency chlorosis, Pythium, <b>Phytophthora</b> <b>root</b> and stem <b>rot</b> and brown stem rot worse. Once established in a field, SCN cannot be eradicated. However, the use of multiple management tactics can help minimize yield loss...|$|R
5000|$|Hardy kiwi vines are {{vulnerable}} to several botanical diseases, including <b>phytophthora</b> crown and <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> (the most serious problem), botrytis rot, and sclerotinia blight. Vines are also vulnerable to pest infestations, including root knot nematodes, two-spotted spider mites, leaf rollers, thrips, and Japanese beetles. [...] Cats can also pose a problem, as they are attracted to a catnip-like smell produced by the hardy kiwi vines. Cats {{have been known to}} destroy vines and dig up roots in search of the source of the scent.|$|R
