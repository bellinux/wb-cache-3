5|$|Storage can be {{short-term}} or long-term. Most {{vegetables are}} perishable and short-term storage {{for a few}} days provides flexibility in marketing. During storage, leafy vegetables lose moisture, and the vitamin C in them degrades rapidly. A few products such as potatoes and onions have better keeping qualities and can be sold when higher prices may be available, and by extending the marketing season, a greater total volume of crop can be sold. If refrigerated storage is not available, the priority for most crops is to store high-quality <b>produce,</b> <b>to</b> maintain a high humidity level, and to keep the produce in the shade.|$|E

5|$|The Sibu Central Market is {{the biggest}} indoor market in Sarawak. It is located at Channel Street, {{opposite}} the Sibu wharf terminal. The central market has food stalls on top floor with dry and wet market on the ground floor. Among the items on sale in this market are exotic fruits, jungle produce, handicrafts, Bario rice, and poultry. There are 1,100 stalls in the market on weekdays and 400-500 additional stalls on weekends when the indigenous people from the interior brought their jungle <b>produce</b> <b>to</b> the market.|$|E
5|$|Both Omar's {{father and}} uncle were killed {{following}} a mortar attack on Bakaara Market, where they worked. Omar {{was in the}} eighth grade at the time, and she dropped out of school in response to look after her siblings while her mother sold <b>produce</b> <b>to</b> provide for the family. Following the encouragement of her mother, she decided to take up running. She would train at Mogadishu Stadium, as the family lived nearby in a hovel. The stadium had a gravel running track, pitted with mortar craters from the ongoing Somali Civil War. When not running at the stadium, she would run on the streets of Mogadishu, facing harassment from local militants who did not believe that Muslim women should participate in sporting activities.|$|E
5|$|Gambier {{and pepper}} farming were mainly {{confined}} to the Bintan (formerly spelled as Bentan) and Galang Islands. Similar to the Kangchu system in Johor, gambier and pepper plantations were established on grants of land by the Yamtuan Muda of Riau, who would issue land permits (Surat Sungai) to the Kangchu who would direct {{the operations of the}} plantation and workers within the settlement. In the early and middle 19th century, many Chinese settlers and merchants from Riau relocated their businesses to Singapore, and established trading links between Riau and Singapore. These settlers and merchants still maintained trading links with Riau, as the Kangchu from Riau often shipped their <b>produce</b> <b>to</b> Singapore for free trade to evade taxes imposed by the Dutch colonial government. Like Singapore, competition for the gambier and pepper trade between the Teochews and Hokkiens in Riau led to communal tensions and sporadic violence in Riau during the 1840s and 1850s. In the early 20th century, the Chinese abandoned gambier and pepper plantations in favour of other agricultural practices, as the worldwide prices for gambier experienced a drastic drop in value and many pepper plants fell prey to a disease plaguing the archipelago.|$|E

5|$|Proposals for {{a railway}} were first made in 1870. Routes via Verdal and Røros were soon {{discarded}} and the Meråker Line was approved on 5 June 1873. The first revenue services ran in 1879 {{and the line}} was officially opened on 22 July 1882. The line gave a boom to the local economy, allowing for same-day transport of <b>produce</b> <b>to</b> Trondheim. The line has been upgraded several times to increase the axle load. During World War II, the line {{was the scene of}} both the Hommelvik train disaster and the Meråker train disaster. Steam trains were in use until 1971, following the introduction of diesel locomotives in 1961. From 1900 to 2005 Meraker Smelteverk was a major customer, using the line to haul carbide, and later microsilica, from their mill at Kopperå to the port at Muruvik. The Norwegian National Rail Administration plans to have electrified and installed centralized traffic control by 2023.|$|E
5|$|Tamu Bintulu and Pasar Utama are the {{two main}} markets in the town. Both places have a unique {{cone-shaped}} roof that symbolises the traditional Melanau headgear named Terendak. Tamu Bintulu offers items ranging from jungle <b>produce</b> <b>to</b> native home-made specialties such as Belacan. Meanwhile, Pasar Utama houses both wet market and dry market under one roof, providing fresh vegetables, fruits, fish, and dairy products. The first floor of Pasar Utama {{offers a variety of}} fast food such as Laksa, Kolok Mee, Jawa Mee, Pulut Panggang, ais batu campur, cendol, and teh tarik. The Bintulu night market is located on Kampung Dagang road. There are over 150 stalls selling a variety of items such as garments, electric goods, vegetables, fruits, food and drinks.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} von Spee withdrew his ships, large {{portions}} of the town had been destroyed. Two entire blocks of Papeete had burnt to the ground before the fires were finally put out. A copra store, a market, and several other buildings and residences were among those destroyed by the shellfire and resulting inferno. While the majority of Papeete's civilians fled to {{the interior of the}} island as soon as the fighting began, a Japanese civilian and a Polynesian boy were both killed by German shellfire. Although the two French vessels in the harbor had been sunk, there were no military casualties on either side and the German vessels took no damage. Overall, the bombardment was estimated in 1915 to have caused over 2million francs' worth of property damage, some of which was recouped through the seizure of a German store on the island. In addition to the seizure of their property, several local Germans were interned and forced to repair the damage von Spee's squadron had caused. Perhaps the most lasting effect of the bombardment on the French was the dramatic fall of copra prices in the region, as local suppliers had previously sold a majority of their <b>produce</b> <b>to</b> German merchants in the area who were now interned. Further havoc and distress spread throughout the island 18 days after von Spee's squadron had left, when rumors started to spread that a second German bombardment was about to begin.|$|E

5|$|Canalisation of the River Slea {{began in}} the 1790s. Canals in England were {{constructed}} from the 1760s to make inland trade easier; Sleaford's businessmen were keen {{to benefit from the}} improved communication they allowed. Sleaford Navigation opened in 1794. It facilitated the export of agricultural <b>produce</b> <b>to</b> the Midlands, and the import of coal and oil. Mills along the Slea benefited and wharves were constructed around Carre Street. Between 1829 and 1836 the navigation's toll rights increased in value by 27 times. The railways emerged in the 19th century as an alternative to canals and arrived at the town in 1857, when a line from Grantham to Sleaford opened. It made agricultural trade easier and improved communication, but led to the decline of the Navigation Company. Income from tolls decreased by 80% between 1858 and 1868; it made its first loss in 1873 and was abandoned in 1878. The town's rural location and transport links meant that the late 19th century saw the rise of two local seed merchants: Hubbard and Phillips, and Charles Sharpe; the former took over the Navigation Wharves, and the latter was trading in the US and Europe by the 1880s. The railway, Sleaford's rural location and its artesian wells, were key factors {{in the development of the}} 13-acre Bass & Co maltings complex at Mareham Lane (1892–1905).|$|E
