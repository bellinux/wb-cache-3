These youth plan {{and put on}} a program each summer in Central California. In 2009 they offered for the first time two camps, one at Camp Tamarancho in Marin County in Northern California, and the second at Camp Lindblad in the Santa Cruz Mountains. They have continued to offer two weeks of summer camp and in 2012 based the <b>program</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> site in the Santa Lucia Range near Arroyo Seco.

5|$|On December 5, 1989, Judge Roth found Taylor {{guilty of}} the first-degree child rape and first-degree murder of Charla Nicole King. During the penalty phase of Taylor's trial, his {{half-sister}} Leslie Beale traveled from Florida to testify about his harsh treatment under his stepfather and the three years that Taylor spent in a sex offender <b>program</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Florida mental institution. On December 19, Taylor became the first convict in 40 years {{to be sent to}} death row by a Weber County court. Roth said that {{the facts of the case}} outweighed any mitigating circumstances. Taylor's father Albert attended most of his son's court proceedings until he died of heart failure on October 8, 1990. Taylor said he was not permitted to attend his father's funeral.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the death}} of her mother in spring 1860 to pneumonia, Ladd went to live with her {{paternal}} grandmother in Portsmouth, New Hampshire where she attended school. Ladd's father remarried in 1862 and produced her half-sister Katherine (born 1862) and half-brother George (born 1867). Ladd was a precocious child who sought to find “a mean to continue her education beyond secondary school.”. Ladd's wish was granted when her father enrolled her in a two-year <b>program</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> coeducational Welshing academy in Wilbraham, Massachusetts; she took the same courses that prepared boys in furthering their education to colleges such as Harvard.|$|E
25|$|The IITs had {{initially}} a quota system, but the quota system was scrapped and the modified scheme described below {{was introduced in}} 1983. This procedure was evolved based {{on the experience of}} implementing a quota system for ten years (1973–1983). The logic cited for this procedure is that IITs being Institutes of National Importance, there should not be any compromise on the quality of students studying in them; accordingly, students admitted through the reserved quota have no relaxation in requirements for passing courses or getting the degree. They are, however, allowed to complete the <b>program</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> slower pace (take longer to get the degree).|$|E
25|$|These {{limitations}} {{mean that}} supporting the multitasking {{of more than}} one <b>program</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time would be difficult, without rewriting all of this operating system and application code. Yet doing so, would mean the system would run unacceptably slow on existing hardware. Instead, Apple adopted a system known as MultiFinder in 1987 which keeps the running application in control of the computer as before but allows an application to be rapidly switched to another, normally simply by clicking on its window. Programs which are not in the foreground are periodically given short bits of time to run, but as before, the entire process is controlled by the applications, not the operating system.|$|E

25|$|Mini-MBA is a {{term used}} by many {{non-profit}} and for-profit institutions to describe a training regimen focused on the fundamentals of business. In the past, Mini-MBA programs have typically been offered as non-credit bearing courses that require less than 100 hours of total learning. However, due to the criticisms of these certificates, many schools have now shifted their programs to offer courses for full credit {{so that they may}} be applied towards a complete traditional MBA degree. This is to allow students to verify business related coursework for employment purposes and still allow the option to complete a full-time MBA degree <b>program</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> later period, if they elect to do so.|$|E
25|$|Lunar Prospector was {{the third}} mission {{selected}} by NASA for full development and construction {{as part of the}} Discovery <b>Program.</b> <b>At</b> <b>a</b> cost of $62.8 million, the 19-month mission was put into a low polar orbit of the Moon, accomplishing mapping of surface composition and possible polar ice deposits, measurements of magnetic and gravity fields, and study of lunar outgassing events. Based on Lunar Prospector Neutron Spectrometer (NS) data, mission scientists have determined that there is indeed water ice in the polar craters of the Moon. The mission ended July 31, 1999 when the orbiter was guided to an impact into a crater near the lunar south pole in an (unsuccessful) attempt to analyze lunar polar water by vaporizing it to allow spectroscopic characterization from Earth telescopes.|$|E

25|$|A single-tasking {{system can}} only run one <b>program</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, while a multi-tasking {{operating}} system allows {{more than one}} program to be running in concurrency. This is achieved by time-sharing, dividing the available processor time between multiple processes that are each interrupted repeatedly in time slices by a task-scheduling subsystem of the operating system. Multi-tasking may be characterized in preemptive and co-operative types. In preemptive multitasking, the operating system slices the CPU time and dedicates a slot {{to each of the}} programs. Unix-like operating systems, e.g., Solaris, Linux, as well as AmigaOS support preemptive multitasking. Cooperative multitasking is achieved by relying on each process to provide time to the other processes in a defined manner. 16-bit versions of Microsoft Windows used cooperative multi-tasking. 32-bit versions of both Windows NT and Win9x, used preemptive multi-tasking.|$|E
25|$|To {{obtain a}} Professional certificate, the {{applicant}} must have completed a NYS-approved teacher education <b>program</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> college/university {{and hold a}} master's degree or above. Each state has different requirements to become a permanently certified teacher, and the requirements keep increasing. For example, professional certification in NYS requires three years of classroom teaching experience. It also requires being mentored by a certified teacher within the first year teaching. However NYS no longer offers permanent certification to those who haven't already been certified by February 2004.The Professional certificate replaces it. To maintain a professional certificate, a teacher must complete 100 hours of professional development every five years. These professional development hours are decreased by a few percentages for every year teaching in a non-public school. One {{does not have to}} teach in New York State to maintain their certificate as many New York teachers teach in Connecticut and New Jersey.|$|E
