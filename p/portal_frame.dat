5|$|Opposite the Bill Struth Main Stand is the Sandy Jardine Stand {{formerly}} known as the Govan Stand. It is a two-tier stand, similar in style to the two end stands, which was completed in 1981. To the rear of the Govan Stand is the Argyle House extension, completed in 1990, which provides executive boxes, hospitality areas and office space. The Bar 72 area was added to the rear section of the Govan Stand in 2006. The Copland Road Stand, at the east end of the stadium, was completed in 1979 and now accommodates just over 8,000 fans. It is traditionally the 'Rangers end' of the ground and the team normally chooses to attack that end {{in the second half of}} matches. The western Broomloan Road Stand, which was completed in 1980, is identical to the opposite end. Although constructed as separate structures, the three stands have been linked since the mid-1990s, when two additional areas of seating were added to the corner areas. All of the stands are designed using the 'goalpost' structure, in which a large <b>portal</b> <b>frame</b> supports perpendicular beams on which roof cladding is secured. A Rangers Megastore is located in the corner between the Copland Road and Govan Stands.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Double-bay or multi-bay <b>portal</b> <b>frames</b> of {{hot-rolled}} steel {{have been}} in existence since {{the development of the}} plastic analysis theory, and the behaviour of the eaves connections of these frames are well established. With the increasing use of cold-formed steel in <b>portal</b> <b>frames,</b> it is necessary to develop connecting structural systems that are favourable to these elements, and to understand the behaviour of these connections. The purpose of this investigation is to develop internal eaves connections of double-bay <b>portal</b> <b>frames</b> of cold-formed steel channels, with the main frames members connected back-to-back. In double-bay <b>portal</b> <b>frames,</b> the columns of two single-bay <b>portal</b> <b>frames,</b> positioned adjacent to each other, are replaced by one internal column. Two internal eaves connections were developed and investigated, and are referred in this paper as Eaves Connection Type 1 (ECT- 1) and Eaves Connection Type 2 (ECT- 2). Tests were then performed to determine the capacity and failure mechanism of these connections, including the members forming these connections. Although the failure mechanisms included local buckling of the compression zone of the web and flange of the channels, and bolt-bearing deformations, all frames finally failed by local buckling of the web and flange of the channels. The moment-curvature graphs show that enough plasticity could not be achieved in both connections...|$|R

This paper investigates the influence of two joint configurations having full rigidity and semirigidity, respectively, on the optimum design of cold-formed steel <b>portal</b> <b>frames.</b> A real-coded genetic algorithm is used to search for the most cost-effective design. It is shown that through incorporating joint effects explicitly into the design process, a more appropriate balance between the joints and the member properties can be obtained, thus optimizing material use. The study then investigates the effect of secondary members on the optimum design. It is shown that incorporating the secondary members is important for <b>portal</b> <b>frames</b> having spans less than 12 m.

In this paper, the effect of stressed-skin action on the optimum design of CFS <b>portal</b> <b>frames</b> is investigated by conducting a minimum cost design optimisation on a building of span of 6 m, height-to-eaves of 3 m and frame spacing of 3 m; the effect of different number of bays are considered. For the purpose of this study, it is assumed that gables are rigid. The effect of stressed-skin action is larger for“square-shaped” buildings (i. e. when the span and length are the same on plan) and decreases as more bays are added(i. e. as the building becomes more “rectangular-shaped” on plan). The results of the minimum cost optimisation indicate that if stressed-skin action is taken into account, the cost of the internal frame can be reduced by around half for “square-shaped” buildings. It should be noted that this is a minimum cost optimisation, which {{is not the same as}} a minimum weight optimisation. It is also shown that a safe design of internal frames could be obtained by ignoring wind loads (i. e. designing the frame only for gravity loads),but this is limited to buildings having a “square-shape”...|$|R

Results for three benchmark frames demonstrate {{the efficiency of the}} optimisation methodology. A genetic algorithm (GA) was used to optimise the dimensions of the plates used for the columns, rafters and haunches. Discrete decision variables were adopted for the thickness of the steel plates and continuous variables for the breadth and depth of the plates. Strategies were developed to enhance the performance of the GA including solution space reduction and a hybrid initial population half of which is derived using Latin hypercube sampling. The results show that the proposed GA-based optimisation model generates optimal and near-optimal solutions consistently. A parametric study is then conducted on frames of different spans. A significant variation in weight between fabricated and conventional hot-rolled steel <b>portal</b> <b>frames</b> is shown; for a 50 m span frame, a 14 – 19 % saving in weight was achieved.
