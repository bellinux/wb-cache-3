50|$|The {{chemical}} stability of PETN is of interest, {{because of the}} presence of PETN in aging weapons. A review has been published. Neutron radiation degrades PETN, producing carbon dioxide and some pentaerythritol dinitrate and trinitrate. Gamma radiation increases the thermal decomposition sensitivity of PETN, lowers melting point by few degrees Celsius, and causes swelling of the samples. Like other nitrate esters, the <b>primary</b> <b>degradation</b> mechanism is the loss of nitrogen dioxide; this reaction is autocatalytic. Studies were performed on thermal decomposition of PETN.|$|E

5000|$|Hydrolysis and {{oxidation}} {{are the two}} <b>primary</b> <b>degradation</b> {{processes that}} occur in an oil during cooking. Oxidative stability is how resistant an oil is to reacting with oxygen, breaking down and potentially producing harmful compounds while exposed to continuous heat. Oxidative stability is {{the best predictor of}} how an oil behaves during cooking [...] The Rancimat® method {{is one of the most}} common methods for testing oxidative stability in oils. This determination entails speeding up the oxidation process in the oil (under heat and forced air), which enables the oils’ stability to be evaluated by monitoring volatile substances associated with rancidity. It is measured as “Induction time” and recorded as total hours before the oil breaks down. Canola oil requires 7.5 hours, for example, whereas extra virgin olive oil ("EVOO") and virgin coconut oil will last over a day at 110 °C of continuous heat.

30|$|The FOCUS {{model was}} {{extended}} by Matthies et al. [63] by {{taking into account}} mineralization and NER as separate pools. They applied their kinetic four-pool model to 14 C-labeled residues measured by aerobic soil incubation studies reported in dossiers submitted for authorization of eight PPPs and determined parameters for first-order kinetic rate constants by fitting time series from 40 studies. Correlation of kinetic rate constants for <b>primary</b> <b>degradation</b> and formation of NER from parent pesticide suggested a common mechanism, presumably co-metabolic microbial activity for both processes. Recently, Loos et al. [64] verified these conclusions by applying the same four-pool kinetic model to a data set of degradation time series for 73 pesticides. They also found a high correlation between <b>primary</b> <b>degradation</b> and formation of NER from the parent compound, indicating that the actual degradation half-lives in soil typically do not exceed disappearance half-lives {{by more than a}} factor of 2. They evaluated only data derived with one standard soil (Speyer 2.2), which reduced the influence of the natural soil variability. A difference in the persistence of a factor of 2 is small compared to the observed natural variability of soil degradation half-lives. FOCUS [60] combines all degradative loss processes of the parent compound, i.e., <b>primary</b> <b>degradation,</b> mineralization, and formation of NER, into a DegT 50 which is used for comparison with the P/vP criteria of 120 / 180 days in soil.|$|E

40|$|For many {{short-lived}} eukaryotic proteins, conjugation to ubiquitin, {{yielding a}} multiubiquitin chain, is an obligatory pre-degradation step. The conjugated ubiquitin moieties {{function as a}} 'secondary' signal for degradation, in that their posttranslational coupling to a substrate protein is mediated by amino acid sequences of the substrate that act as a <b>primary</b> <b>degradation</b> signal. We report that the fusion protein ubiquitin [...] proline [...] beta-galactosidase (Ub-P-beta gal) is short-lived in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae because its N-terminal ubiquitin moiety functions as an autonomous, <b>primary</b> <b>degradation</b> signal. This signal mediates {{the formation of a}} multiubiquitin chain linked to Lys 48 of the N-terminal ubiquitin in Ub-P-beta gal. The degradation of Ub-P-beta gal is shown to require Ubc 4, one of at least seven ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in S. cerevisiae.

40|$|Staphylococcus {{epidermidis}} is {{a leading}} pathogen accounting for nosocomial infections. The ability to form biofilms is considered the major virulence factor of this bacterium.

We have identified a subpopulation of bacteria that we believe to be the responsible for the extracellular matrix accumulation in S. epidermidis biofilms as they have comparative significant higher amount of surface N-acetylglucosamine. Flow cytometric evaluation of cell wall permeability and transmission electronic microscopy are highly suggestive of <b>primary</b> wall <b>degradation</b> in these bacteria.

Analysis of soil extracts, using gas chromatography, demonstrated that only 10 % {{of the compound}} remained at initial concentrations of 10 and 100 ppm (wt/wt) of methoxychlor. Evidence is presented that a dechlorination reaction was responsible for <b>primary</b> <b>degradation</b> of methoxychlor. Analysis of soils treated with 100 ppm of methoxychlor {{in the presence of}} 2 % HgCl 2 showed that 100 % of the compound remained after 3 months, indicating that degradation in the unpoisoned flasks was biologically mediated. Methanogenic organisms, however, are probably not involved, as strong inhibition of methane production was observed in all soils treated with methoxychlor. During the 3 -month incubation period, little or no evaluation of 14 CO 2 or 14 CH 4 occurred under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Cometabolic processes may be responsible for the extensive molecular changes which occurred with methoxychlor because the rate of its disappearance from soil was observed to level off after exhaustion of soil organic matter. After this incubation period, soils previously incubated under anaerobic conditions were converted to aerobic conditions. The rates of 14 CO 2 evolution from soils exposed to anaerobic and aerobic sequences of environments ranged from 10 - to 70 -fold greater than that observed for soils exposed solely to an aerobic environment...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) is the <b>primary</b> {{selective}} <b>degradation</b> {{system in}} the nuclei and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, required for the turnover of myriad soluble proteins. The hundreds of factors that comprise the UPS include an enzymatic cascade that tags proteins for degradation via the covalent attachment of a poly-ubiquitin chain, and a large multimeric enzyme that degrades ubiquitinated proteins, the proteasome. Protein degradation by the UPS regulates many pathways and is a crucial component of the cellular proteostasis network. Dysfunction of the ubiquitination machinery or the proteolytic activity of the proteasome is associated with numerous human diseases.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mass spectrometric}} {{technique}} of K+ ionization of desorbed species, K+IDS, is used here {{to characterize the}} <b>primary</b> thermal <b>degradation</b> chemistry of small peptides. In this technique, {{a small amount of}} a compound is rapidly heated in the condensed phase. Desorption of the intact molecule can occur. Also, thermal degradation products are formed which quickly desorb as well, rather than remain on the surface and undergo subsequent chemistry. The desorbed molecules form adducts with gas phase K+ ions, and a mass spectrum is obtained. Deuterium labeling experiments, and the use of derivatizing reagents, allows for the thermal degradation chemistry of small peptides to be elucidated. Apparently, skeletal bond cleavages are accompanied by H-shifts, although the hydrogen atoms shift from “remote” sites, brought into close proximity with the fragmenting skeletal bond via secondary interactions. Experimental results are presented that allow for correlations between thermal degradation chemistry and the resulting K+IDS mass spectra to be made...|$|R
