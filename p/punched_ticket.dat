50|$|In general, {{conductors}} in Switzerland collect or <b>punch</b> <b>tickets,</b> fine {{people the}} first charge of 100 CHF {{for not having}} a valid fare, and make announcements on the public address system. They also may fine passengers if they take a longer trip than normal. For example, if one takes a train to Bern via Biel, having departed from Geneva, which is a longer trip than taking the InterCity via Lausanne, the conductor can fine the passenger a supplementary fare. They sound a warning when the train's doors are going to close. Many conductors, especially those on night shift and on isolated regional lines, are being trained in self-defence against would-be assailants.|$|R

During the 2000s, TRA incrementally replaced older thermal ticket printers with {{automated fare collection}} (AFC) devices using magnetic-backed stock. Busy stations have faregates to speed up validation. Tickets can be inserted in any orientation. Gates align, check, and mechanically <b>punch</b> <b>tickets</b> prior to opening. Validations are fast and can be [...] "pipelined" [...] or [...] "stacked" [...] (i.e. following passenger can insert ticket while previouspassenger is proceeding through the gate). Passenger counting sensors quickly close gates when as many passengers entered as valid tickets processed. When exiting, faregates collect and cancel single trip tickets.|$|R
