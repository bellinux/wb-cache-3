5|$|Healthcare in Tripura {{features}} a {{universal health care}} system run by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of the Government of Tripura. The health care infrastructure {{is divided into three}} tiers– the <b>primary</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> network, a secondary care system comprising district and sub-divisional hospitals and tertiary hospitals providing speciality and super speciality care. As of 2010–11, there are 17 hospitals, 11 rural hospitals and community health centres, 79 primary health centres, 635 sub-centres/dispensaries, 7 blood banks and 7 blood storage centres in the state. Homeopathic and Ayurvedic styles of medicine are also popular in the state. The National Family Health Survey– 3 conducted in 2005–06 revealed that 20 per cent of the residents of Tripura do not generally use government health facilities, and prefers private medical sector. This is overwhelmingly less compared to the national level, where 65.6 per cent do not rely on government facilities. As in the rest of India, Tripura residents also cite poor quality of care as the most frequent reason for non-reliance over public health sector. Other reasons include distance of the public sector facility, long waiting time, and inconvenient hours of operation. As of 2010, the state's performance in major public health care indices, such as birth rate, infant mortality rate and total fertility rate is better than the national average. The state is vulnerable to epidemics of Malaria, Diarrhea, Japanese Encephalitis and Meningitis. In summer 2014 the state witnessed a major Malaria outbreak.|$|E

Data were sourced from a national web-based minimum dataset. RESULTS: Between 1 July 2003 and 30 June 2012, 51 716 young consumers received 245 704 sessions via the <b>primary</b> mental <b>health</b> program. Around two thirds were female and the average age was 19  years. The majority had depressive and/or anxiety disorders. Most services were delivered to individuals (including just the young person and/or the young person with one or both parents), in a face-to-face context and free of charge. Cognitive and behavioral strategies were the most common interventions delivered. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>primary</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> program has been well utilized by people aged 12 to 25  years.

40|$|The Movement for Global Mental Health’s (MGMH) {{efforts to}} scale up the {{availability}} {{of mental health services}} have been moderately successful. Investigations in resource-poor countries like South Africa have pointed to the value of an integrated <b>primary</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> model and multidisciplinary collaboration to support mental health needs in underserved and underresourced communities. However, there remains a need to explore how these policies play out within the daily realities of communities marked by varied environmental and relational complexities. Arguably, the lived realities of mental health policy and service delivery processes are best viewed through ethnographic approaches, which remain underutilised in the field of global mental health. This paper reports on findings from a case study of mental health services for HIV-affected women in a rural South African setting, which employed a motivated ethnography in order to explore the realities of the <b>primary</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> model and related policies in South Africa. Findings highlighted the influence of three key symbolic (intangible) factors that impact on the efficacy of the <b>primary</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> model: power dynamics, which shaped relationships within multidisciplinary teams; stigma, which limited the efficacy of task-shifting strategies; and the silencing of women’s narratives of distress within services. The resultant gap between policy ideals and the reality of practice is discussed. The paper concludes with recommendations for building on existing successes in the delivery of <b>primary</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> in South Africa...|$|R
