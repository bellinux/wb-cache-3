5|$|In the laboratory, <b>{{platinum}}</b> <b>wire</b> is {{used for}} electrodes; platinum pans and supports are used in thermogravimetric analysis because of the stringent requirements of chemical inertness upon heating to high temperatures (~1000°C). Platinum is used as an alloying agent for various metal products, including fine wires, noncorrosive laboratory containers, medical instruments, dental prostheses, electrical contacts, and thermocouples. Platinum-cobalt, an alloy of roughly three parts platinum and one part cobalt, is used to make relatively strong permanent magnets. Platinum-based anodes are used in ships, pipelines, and steel piers.|$|E
5|$|Calcium, {{along with}} its {{congeners}} magnesium, strontium, and barium, was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1808. Following the work of Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Magnus Martin af Pontin on electrolysis, Davy isolated calcium and magnesium by putting a mixture of the respective metal oxides with mercury(II) oxide on a platinum plate which {{was used as the}} anode, the cathode being a <b>platinum</b> <b>wire</b> partially submerged into mercury. Electrolysis then gave calcium–mercury and magnesium–mercury amalgams, and distilling off the mercury gave the metal. However, pure calcium cannot be prepared in bulk by this method and a workable commercial process for its production was not found until over a century later.|$|E
25|$|The silver {{chloride}} electrode is {{most commonly used}} as a reference electrode in pH meters, although some designs use the saturated calomel electrode. The {{silver chloride}} electrode is simple to manufacture and provides high reproducibility. The reference electrode usually consists of a <b>platinum</b> <b>wire</b> that has contact with a silver / silver chloride mixture, which is immersed in a potassium chloride solution. There is a ceramic plug, {{which serves as a}} contact to the test solution, providing low resistance while preventing mixing of the two solutions.|$|E

50|$|Several {{different}} emitter configurations {{have been}} used for FD emitters, such as single tips, sharp blades and thin wires. Single metal tips can be made from etching wires either by periodically dipping them into molten salts or by electrolysis in aqueous solutions. Compared to other emitter types, the single tips have the advantage that they can reach the highest field strengths. In addition, well-defined geometric shape of a single tip allows accurate calculation of the potential distribution in the space between the tip and the counter electrode. For blades used as emitters, their ruggedness under the high electric field is one of their advantages. Different thin wires were also used as emitters, such as <b>platinum</b> <b>wires</b> and tungsten <b>wires.</b> <b>Platinum</b> <b>wires</b> are fragile, and tungsten wires are much more stable than <b>platinum</b> <b>wires.</b> Among those emitters, carbon-microneedles tungsten wires are the most widely used emitters in FD mass spectrometry.|$|R

25|$|In 1839 Major-General Charles Pasley, at {{the time}} a colonel of the Royal Engineers, {{commenced}} operations. Pasley had previously destroyed some old wrecks in the Thames to clear a channel using gunpowder charges; his plan was to break up the wreck of Royal George in a similar way and then salvage as much as possible using divers. The charges used were made from oak barrels filled with gunpowder and covered with lead. They were initially detonated using chemical fuses, but this was later changed to an electrical system using a resistance-heated <b>platinum</b> <b>wire</b> to detonate the gunpowder.|$|E
25|$|Pyrolysis is {{the thermal}} {{decomposition}} of materials in an inert atmosphere or a vacuum. The sample {{is put into}} direct contact with a <b>platinum</b> <b>wire,</b> or placed in a quartz sample tube, and rapidly heated to 600–1000°C. Depending on the application even higher temperatures are used. Three different heating techniques are used in actual pyrolyzers: Isothermal furnace, inductive heating (Curie Point filament), and resistive heating using platinum filaments. Large molecules cleave at their weakest points and produce smaller, more volatile fragments. These fragments can be separated by gas chromatography. Pyrolysis GC chromatograms are typically complex because {{a wide range of}} different decomposition products is formed. The data can either be used as fingerprint to prove material identity or the GC/MS data is used to identify individual fragments to obtain structural information. To increase the volatility of polar fragments, various methylating reagents can be added to a sample before pyrolysis.|$|E

It was the large Grove battery. A current passed from it to copper wires, in a certain manner, produced a dazzling green light, and the copper melted like wax. With silver a still brighter and purer green flame was the result. With platinum an intense white light was given off, and the molten metal fell in globules of exceeding brilliancy. With iron lovely coruscations were exhibited, the boiling vapour flying and burning in all directions; and a <b>platinum</b> <b>wire</b> three feet long was in an instant melted into thousands of minute globules. All this showed the power of electricity to produce intense heat when resistance is opposed to its passage." ...|$|E
6000|$|All that I {{have to say}} is, that, in my belief, {{consciousness}} and molecular action are capable of being expressed by one another, just as heat and mechanical action are capable of being {{expressed in terms of}} one another. Whether we shall ever be able to express consciousness in foot-pounds, or not, is more than I will venture to say; but that there is evidence of the existence of some correlation between mechanical motion and consciousness, is as plain as anything can be. Suppose the poles of an electric battery to be connected by a <b>platinum</b> <b>wire.</b> A certain intensity of the current gives rise in the mind of a bystander to that state of consciousness we call a [...] "dull red light"--a little greater intensity to another which we call a [...] "bright red light;" [...] increase the intensity, and the light becomes white; and, finally, it dazzles, and a new state of consciousness arises, which we term pain. Given the same wire and the same nervous apparatus, and the amount of electric force required to give rise to these several states of consciousness will be the same, however often the experiment is repeated. And as the electric force, the light waves, and the nerve-vibrations caused by the impact of the light-waves on the retina, are all expressions of the molecular changes which are taking place in the elements of the battery; so consciousness is, in the same sense, an expression of the molecular changes which take place in that nervous matter, which is the organ of consciousness.|$|E

50|$|The other {{extremely}} {{widespread use}} for Pt/Ir alloy is fabrication of metal microelectrodes for electrical stimulation of nervous tissue and electrophysiological recordings. Pt/Ir alloy has an optimal combination of mechanical and electrochemical properties for this application. Pure iridium {{is very difficult}} to pull into small diameter wires; at the same time, platinum has a low Young's modulus which makes pure <b>platinum</b> <b>wires</b> bend easily during the insertion in nervous tissue.
