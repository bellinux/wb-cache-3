The result was a treaty that created a condominium among the three powers, allowing all of them access to the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Even though Agatha passed {{close to}} Mexico as it weakened, no impact {{is known to}} have been caused. Waves caused by Agatha did impact a ship called the Polynesian Diakan. A Greek {{freighter}} en route from <b>Pago</b> <b>Pago</b> to Terminal Island, California, the Polynesian Diakan began flooding on June 3, forcing the 32-man crew to abandon the vessel. The exact cause of the initial flooding was unknown, but was speculated to be primarily due to cargo shifting and not the weather. The crew was rescued by the United States Coast Guard. Three members required hospitalization. After being reached on June 6 by a tugboat in a salvage attempt, the vessel capsized and sank near San Clemente Island on June 7, taking its multimillion-dollar cargo of 71 containers of canned tuna with it. The reason for the sinking was unknown.|$|E

5|$|On December 30, TCWC Nadi {{reported}} that a tropical depression had developed about 860km (535mi), to the northeast of <b>Pago</b> <b>Pago</b> in American Samoa. Over {{the next couple of}} days the system moved towards the south-southeast and gradually developed further, before the NPMOC designated the depression as Tropical Cyclone 05P. During January 1, TCWC Nadi {{reported that}} the depression had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone and named it William as it passed near the Cook Island of Autitaki. During the next day William subsequently slowly accelerated as it passed near too or over several other Cook Islands and intensified into a category 2 tropical cyclone. Early on January 3, TCWC Nadi reported that the system had reached its peak 10-minute wind speeds of 110km/h (70mph) as it passed near or over the French Polynesian islands of Maria and Rimatara.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Urmil {{originated}} from a weak tropical disturbance over the open {{waters of the}} south Pacific Ocean on January13. Around 1800UTC, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji classified the system as Tropical Disturbance 06F, while it was located about 370km (230mi) west of <b>Pago</b> <b>Pago,</b> American Samoa. Forming {{in the wake of}} Tropical Cyclone Tam, the disturbance rapidly organized within an environment of favorable diffulence aloft, warm waters (29°C; 84.2°F), and moderate wind shear. Six hours later, RSMC Nadi upgraded 06F to a tropical cyclone and gave it the name Urmil while it was situated near Niuatoputapu, Tonga. Shortly after, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as the storm quickly traveled towards the south-southeast. Around 0600UTC on January14, the JTWC classified Urmil as Tropical Cyclone 07P.|$|E

25|$|In 1985, King of Tonga Taufa'ahau Tupou IV {{visited the}} British Aerospace factory in Woodford, leading to hopes with the {{manufacturer}} that Tonga would purchase the British Aerospace ATP. However, {{the government of}} Tonga and the Tonga Commodities Board purchased a CASA 212 and Britten Norman Islander with which domestic flights could be started. Flights to <b>Pago</b> <b>Pago</b> (American Samoa) and Apia (Western Samoa) were begun with the CASA in 1986. As airfields in Vavaʻu, Haʻapai, ʻEua and the Niuas were upgraded, the airline upgraded the inter-island aircraft. In 1989 the airline leased two de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters to replace the CASA and Islander, and after the initial lease period, purchased the aircraft the lessor, Guinness Peat Aviation. In June 1991, the name was changed from Friendly Island Airways to Royal Tongan Airlines, and international services were begun with a Boeing 737-200 which was leased from Solomon Airlines from Tongatapu to Auckland, New Zealand. The airline was considering acquiring a Douglas DC-8 in order to operate flights to Australia, New Zealand and Honolulu, however this didn't eventuate and in 1994 the airline entered into a codeshare agreement with Polynesian Airlines on routes to Sydney, Honolulu and Los Angeles.|$|E

By 0600UTC on February12, the system's outflow improved and a small area of deep convection, known as the central dense overcast, developed over the center of circulation. Later that day, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji upgraded the system to a Category 1 cyclone and gave it the name Nancy while it was located about 485km (300mi) east-northeast of <b>Pago</b> <b>Pago,</b> American Samoa.

500|$|The United States first {{expressed}} interest in building a naval station at <b>Pago</b> <b>Pago,</b> Samoa in 1872 {{at the behest of}} Henry A. Peirce, the United States Minister to Hawaii. A treaty to that effect was written and submitted, but it was not approved by the United States Senate. On February 13, 1878, a separate treaty was ratified by the Senate that granted the Samoan government diplomatic recognition and reaffirmed permission to build a naval station in the country. There were no further political obstacles, but funding for the station was not allocated and only a small coaling station was built on the island. Construction of the naval station did not begin until 1898, led by civilian contractors. In early 1899, Tilley was assigned the task of overseeing the station construction and becoming its first commandant.

Although warm sea surface temperatures of [...] in the region favored development of a tropical cyclone, the southern trough developed substantially slower than the northern one. On December19, the southern component was classified as Tropical Depression 03F by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji (Fiji Meteorological Service); at this time the depression was situated just east of the Solomon Islands. The northern component eventually developed into Typhoon Faxai, an extremely powerful Category 5 equivalent cyclone. Unlike Faxai, the precursor to Cyclone Waka developed slowly, mainly because of moderate wind shear in the region. Moving southeastward, the system gradually became more organized. On two occasions, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert; however, the agency later canceled them both times. By December27, the depression had entered a region of lesser shear, favoring significant development of the system.

500|$|A {{discernible}} area of {{low pressure}} formed east of Tonga on February 23. The {{area of low pressure}} moved eastward, where it strengthened into Tropical Depression 10F a day later. Since the depression {{was located in}} an area of low wind shear and warm water temperatures, it was able to quickly strengthen into Tropical Storm Percy. At this point in time, Percy was located [...] east of Fongafale, Tuvalu, and was moving towards the east-southeast at 14 kt (16mph, 26km/h). On February 26, Percy reached Category 1 status, while located 400miles (644km) north of American Samoa. While Percy moved east-southeast, a shortwave trough developed southwest of the storm. The trough caused the cyclone to intensify even further to a Category3 storm as it passed between Fakaofa and Swains Island. Percy then reached Category4 status north of <b>Pago</b> <b>Pago</b> as it winds reached over 135mph (115knots, 213km/h) and the barometric pressure at its center fell to 925millibars. On February 27, Cyclone Percy encountered a high pressure ridge which slowed its forward speed. Because of this, the cyclone's structure became elliptical, which caused the cyclone to weaken back to Category3 status. By February 28, Percy bypassed the Pukapuka and Nassau Islands as a Category3 cyclone as it continued to move east-southeast.|$|E
