It is presumed that assimilating the strategies could have positive contribution to business performance, {{in this regard}} alignment between marketing strategy and financial strategy {{seems to be the}} most important strategies being studied. An empirical work in generic pharmaceutical manufacturing companies for evaluating effect of alignment between these two functions on organizational performance was developed in this paper. Methods:All Iranian pharmaceutical generic manufactures listed in Tehran stock market have been tested for period of five years between 2006 [...] 2010 and their marketing strategies were determined by using Slater and Olson taxonomy and their financial strategies have been developed by calculating total risk and total return of sample companies for five years based on rate of risk and return in the frame of a 2 x 2 matrix. For the business performance three <b>profitability</b> <b>indices</b> including Q-Tubin (Rate of market value to net asset value), ROA (Return on Asset), ROE (Return on Equity) have been tested.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} and compare <b>profitability</b> <b>indices</b> of tilapia production under monoculture, polyculture, and integrated culture models. The study covered a total of 47 tilapia farmers in Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Hainan, Yunnan provinces in the southern coastal areas, and Hebei province in Northern China. The study focused on two objectives: (i) Socioeconomic and production characteristics that influence tilapia production; (ii) <b>Profitability</b> <b>indices,</b> and breakeven analysis of tilapia production using a structured questionnaire. All calculations for the 3 culture models in this study are based on 1 mu (667 m 2 or 0. 666 ha). The study found that all tilapia farms visited were owned by males. About 72. 9 % of the farmers were 30 to 50 years of age; 50 % of the farmers had undergone vocational training. Tilapia farm production areas averaged 70. 2 mu (~ 4. 7 ha) per farmer, and pond aquaculture accounted for 87. 5 % of their production. Tilapia production costs were an average of US$ 1168. 4 (1 yuan=US$ 6. 6). Positive Gross Margins (GM) and Net Incomes (NFI) were observed. Tilapia production was economically viable with positive Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) of US$ 0. 24 in monoculture, and US$ 0. 15 in other culture models. Farmers with low yields, especially tilapia cultured in an integrated model were expected to sell fish at US$ 0. 93 per kilogram to recover invested capital within a single production season averaging 6 months. Positive Returns on Investment (ROI) of US$ 0. 22 - 0. 15 /kg were observed in monoculture and polyculture respectively. In conclusion, the study found that for farmers to increase tilapia production profit margins, tilapia stocking densities need to increase, especially under integrated culture, and improvements are needed in fish feed utilization to reduce current feed conversion ratios (FCR). In order to boost sales, farmers must ensure production of quality fish, and seek alternative markets such as Africa...|$|R

A Bayesian econometric model was used considering ridge regression for multicollinearity problems among the variables in the model.

We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the parameters, considering normal and Student t distributions for the error and assumed that the initial values for the lagged dependent variable are not fixed, but generated by a random process. The recursive predictive density criterion was used for model comparisons. Twenty models were tested and {{the results indicated that}} multicollinearity does influence the value of the estimated parameters.

40|$|Climate Change and Cassava Processing in Southeast Nigeria. Climate {{change is}} perhaps the most serious {{environmental}} threat to whom African agriculture is confronted today, essentially because of its impact on pre- and post-harvest agricultural productivity. Available literature shows that most of the recent studies on climate change and agriculture were mainly focused on pre-harvest, with little or no emphasis on post-harvest issues. This study aims to provide empirical information on the effect of climate change on cassava processing and on the cost-effectiveness of indigenous adaptation practices relative thereto. The study was conducted in two randomly selected states of southeast Nigeria and in four randomly selected agricultural zones, two from each state. The data were collected using a well-structured questionnaire administered to 320 randomly selected cassava processors. The result of the analysis shows that the respondents were predominantly women who, in addition to cassava processing, also grow cassava. Virtually all of them were, not only aware of climate change, but also aware that it will have effects on cassava post-harvest operations. The respondents suggest {{that as a result of}} climate change, the length of time cassava tubers can stay in the soil without spoiling has been decreasing while the water content of cassava tubers has been increasing. In addition, the storage quality of all the products has been deteriorating, just as the growth of spoilage moulds in the products during storage has been increasing. Moreover, the fermentation period for akpu and alibo has been increasing while there has been a general decline in the quantity of product yield after processing for all the products. Some of the adaptation measures used by the processors include increased use of water, palm oil, hired labour and wood fuel, increased harvesting of cassava earlier than usual, processing of more adaptive varieties of cassava, shifts in the timing of processing as the weather also shifts and increased fermentation in the open spaces. There were also some relatively new adaptation practices such as the use of detergents, nails, beans and bitter leaf to aid fermentation, especially for the production of akpu and alibo. In terms of profitability, the four adaptation practices with high <b>profitability</b> <b>indices</b> were, in order of decreasing importance, increased use of sundrying, water, hired labor and palm oil. The study therefore recommends that breeding of improved varieties of cassava should begin to target those that are tolerant to excessive and extreme fluctuations of rainfall, heat and flood. In addition, the adaptation practices with high <b>profitability</b> <b>indices</b> should be vigorously disseminated. Also, further studies, especially on the chemistry of the observed relatively new adaptation practices should be explored...|$|R
