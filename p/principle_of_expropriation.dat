More important regulation is included inthe Czech Bill of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms, where is determined constitutional <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>Expropriation</b> and limitation <b>of</b> property rights. These conditions are: "in public interest under {{the rule of law and}} with compensation. " These constitutional principles are specificated in the Czech Civil Code and expropriation act. Very important for Czech regulation are international documents for example the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms from 1950. Specially the First Protocol to the European Convention, signed in Paris in 1952, includes the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possesion in the Article 1. Third chapter is dealing with definition of expropriation: "taking out property by public authority.

Both cases dealt with the issue of whether the mineral rights/mining rights of private holders were expropriated by legislation which prohibited mining in one way or another. A comparison between the cases shows the approaches towards the issues and what exactly constitutes deprivation and/or acquisition of property for purposes <b>of</b> <b>expropriation</b> and whether deprivation and/or acquisition actually took place. The differences between the mineral law systems of Australia and South Africa (before the enactment of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act 28 of 2002 (hereafter “MPRDA”)) and the protection afforded against the resumption/expropriation of mineral rights or mining rights will be set as background information for {{a better understanding of the}} respective decisions.

It's clear that confiscatory or nationalizing states measure doesn't increase its investment attractivity and so states are nowadays in the sphere of takings into foreign investor property interests much more careful and more inventive. The task of submitted work is among other things to characterize these takings referred to by notion indirect expropriation and to differentiate them from legitimate state measures regarding the general social aims and social interests, which don't require any compensation in contrast to indirect expropriation. By reason that the right to expropriate is seen to be part of customary international law, there was especially a developed states effort to regulate the conditions of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objectives}} of this thesis are to clarify and distinguish the existence <b>of</b> regulatory <b>expropriation</b> from other types <b>of</b> indirect <b>expropriation</b> and to propose alternative ways to rescrutinise regulatory <b>expropriation</b> in light <b>of</b> its establishment and justification in international law. In pursuing the first objective, the research delves into certain national, regional, and international contexts, identifying the key features <b>of</b> regulatory <b>expropriation</b> – for instance, regulatory autonomy and regulatory interference – and conducts an extensive exploration <b>of</b> the relevant <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> international law. This exploration concentrates {{especially on the}} doctrine of police power and on principles that can contribute to an elaborated application of the doctrine for the identification <b>of</b> regulatory <b>expropriation.</b> With regard to the second objective, the research examines the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> necessity in international law that functions to preclude the wrongfulness of a state’s act and also {{takes into account the}} interacting relationship between customary international law and bilateral investment agreements. In addition, the research goes a step further by means of its analysis of the necessity exception in WTO law.

40|$|In Arun the Constitutional Court {{held that}} section 28 of the Land Use Planning Ordinance (LUPO) vests all land {{indicated}} as public roads on a development {{plan in the}} local authority upon approval of such a plan. This includes land that is {{in excess of the}} normal need of the development. The appellant must hence be compensated for the "expropriation" of such excess land if the provision is to comply with section 25 (2) of the Constitution. This ruling is problematic for both expropriation law and administrative law. In terms of section 25 (2) four objections may be raised against the Arun decision. Firstly, it disregards the function of the public interest requirement for expropriation, as understood in view of the law-of-general-application requirement (which, in turn, is informed by the legality principle). The state cannot expropriate property for purposes that are ultra vires (or ulterior to) the authorising legislation. Yet the Arun court seems to allow just this by permitting the local authority to acquire land unrelated to the normal need of the development against payment of compensation instead of setting the attempted expropriation aside. The judgment, secondly, ignores the role of compensation under section 25 (2). Merely paying compensation to an affected party cannot turn an invalid expropriation into a valid one, since compensation is merely the result <b>of</b> a valid <b>expropriation</b> and not a justification for it. Thirdly, it makes the distinction between deprivation and expropriation pivot on the effect of the property limitation, which is unable to properly distinguish between these two forms of limitation in all instances. Finally, Moseneke DCJ's ruling seems to afford an election to litigants who are affected by materially defective expropriations to choose whether to accept the expropriation and claim compensation or to have it reviewed and set aside under PAJA. This election, if it indeed exists, subverts the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>expropriation</b> law and may have negative repercussions for both expropriation law and administrative law, especially in view <b>of</b> the single-system-of-law <b>principle.</b> From an administrative law perspective the authors identify four considerations that could assist courts in determining whether administrative law should be considered, if not applied, in a given case. The first is the internal coherency of the law in view <b>of</b> the subsidiarity <b>principles.</b> The subsidiarity principles provide guidelines for courts to decide cases where two fundamental rights might be applicable. A principled approach is necessary in this context to ensure that the law operates as a single system and displays the positive characteristics of such a system. The fact that Moseneke DCJ preferred to award compensation to Arun instead <b>of</b> reviewing the <b>expropriation</b> under PAJA runs contrary to these principles and seems to result in an outcome which endorses – instead of prevents – administrative injustice. Secondly, the Constitutional Court's refusal to follow PAJA by reason of its being onerous on the appellant contradicts earlier case law where the Court held that time-periods under the Act cannot be circumvented by reason of their being burdensome. The rationale behind these time-periods is integral to securing administrative justice, since time-periods are not merely formalistic technicalities. Thirdly, the authors argue that a green-light approach to internal remedies could have resulted in the broadening of the interpretative context and recognition of the legitimate role of the public administration in the state. Finally, deference as understood by Dyzenhaus also exemplifies why administrative law should not be ignored in cases which concern the exercise of public power. According to Dyzenhaus, deference requires courts to actively participate in the justification of administrative decisions by asking whether the administration's "reasoning did in fact and also could in principle justify the conclusion reached"...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} capital movements in the presence <b>of</b> potential <b>expropriation.</b> The threat <b>of</b> <b>expropriation</b> is derived from utility maximizing behavior by host countries. Potential investors, anticipating this behavior, modify their investment plans to avoid expropriation.

The consequent equilibrium may be characterized {{by a number of}} distortions. In the simplest model we analyze, a host country faces a large number of potential, competitive foreign investors. We explore the implications of the threat <b>of</b> <b>expropriation</b> for shadow pricing in the host country and for the optimal technology choice by potential investors. We consider variants of the model in which the potential investor is in a monopoly position vis-a-vis the host country, in which the foreign investment project is subject to risk which is unresolved at the time <b>of</b> the <b>expropriation</b> decision, and in which factors affecting the optimality <b>of</b> <b>expropriation</b> by the host country are unresolved {{at the time of the}} investment decision.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] Verkrygende verjaring word meestal beskou as ’n gedeelte van die Suid-Afrikaanse reg wat redelik regseker en onproblematies is. Die klaarblyklik onkontroversiële aard van hierdie regsreël is egter onlangs in twyfel getrek deur die vierde kamer van die Europese hof vir menseregte in die Pye-saak, waar bevind is dat adverse possession – die common law-eweknie van verjaring – ’n onteiening sonder vergoeding behels, welke gevolg strydig met artikel 1 van die eerste protokol tot die Europese Verdrag vir Menseregte, 1950 is. Alhoewel hierdie bevinding op appèl omvergewerp is, beklemtoon dit die belangrikheid van die vraag of verjaring (wat ook eiendomsverlies sonder vergoeding tot gevolg het) op een lyn met artikel 25 van die Suid-Afrikaanse Grondwet is. Om dit te beantwoord, ontleed ons die prosesse oor verjaring met verwysing na die FNB-metodologie. Hierdie artikel fokus spesifiek op die onteieningsvraagstuk, naamlik of verjaring ’n onteiening van regte ingevolge artikel 25 (2) meebring. Ten einde dié kwessie aan te spreek ontleed ons hierdie regsreël teen die agtergrond van sekere kernaspekte van die Suid-Afrikaanse onteieningsreg, naamlik die aard van die onteieningsbegrip, die relevansie van staatsverkryging, welke regsbronne onteiening magtig, asook die metodes waarvolgens onteiening kan geskied. Laastens ondersoek ons die vraag of verjaring moontlik konstruktiewe onteiening behels. Deur hierdie ondersoek word getoon dat dit hoogs onwaarskynlik is dat verjaring onteiening meebring. Verjaring vind bykans altyd tussen private individue plaas en dus kan daar geen sprake van staatsverkryging van onteiende regte wees nie. Verder verleen die verjaringswette geensins onteieningsbevoegdheid aan die staat nie en maak hulle ook nie voorsiening vir vergoeding nie. Daarby kan verjaring ook nie maklik onder enige van die bestaande onteieningsmetodes tuisgebring word nie. Laastens redeneer ons dat konstruktiewe onteiening waarskynlik nie in die Suid-Afrikaanse reg bestaan nie. Gevolglik is dit dogmaties beter om verjaring te beskou as ’n nie-arbitrêre ontneming van eiendomsreg, welke ontneming nie ’n onteiening van regte tot gevolg het nie. ABSTRACT: Acquisitive prescription {{is one of the}} original methods of acquisition of ownership and is regulated mainly by two prescription acts, read together with the common law. The requirements of this legal institution are reasonably clear and therefore most of the common law sources, the courts and legal scholars regard it as rather unproblematic in South African law. However, the apparently uncontroversial nature of this legal institution was recently challenged (although not in the South African context) in the Pye case where the fourth chamber of the European court of human rights found that adverse possession – the common law equivalent of acquisitive prescription – amounted to an uncompensated expropriation that was contrary to article 1 of the first protocol (the property clause) to the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 1950. Although this decision was subsequently overturned on appeal by the grand chamber of the European court it highlights the question whether the processes surrounding prescription, which in effect results in a forced transfer of ownership, complies with section 25 of the Constitution of South Africa. This question is indeed topical in our law, for it was recently argued before the Western Cape high court that the loss of ownership brought about by prescription results in an uncompensated expropriation. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain clarity in this regard. To address this matter the authors analyse prescription in terms of the FNB methodology, with specific emphasis on the question whether prescription results in an uncompensated <b>expropriation</b> <b>of</b> property in conflict with section 25 (2) of the Constitution. Scrutiny <b>of</b> the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>expropriation,</b> considered together with the difference between expropriation methods, leads to the conclusion that is unlikely that the effect of acquisitive prescription can be seen as <b>expropriation.</b> One <b>of</b> the key factors used by the courts to distinguish between expropriation and deprivation is to determine whether there was state acquisition of the expropriated property. In light of this approach {{it is difficult to see}} how prescription can amount to expropriation, as prescription cases invariably occur between private individuals. The state will seldom, if ever, acquire property in this manner. Furthermore, only the state has the power to expropriate property in South African law, which power must be explicitly granted to the state by way of authorising legislation. In addition, the empowering statute must set out the circumstances, procedures and conditions under which expropriation may take place, as well as the purpose for which property may be expropriated. It is trite law that expropriatory legislation must also provide for compensation. Should the authorising statute not contain any explicit or tacit provision for the payment of compensation, it is presumed that the legislation does not allow expropriation. Against this background it is significant that neither of the two prescription acts authorises the state to expropriate property. Furthermore, they do not set out the circumstances, procedures or conditions under which expropriation may take place either, nor do they mention the specific purpose for which property may be expropriated or provide for compensation. These factors underscore the unlikelihood of a conclusion that prescription results in <b>expropriation</b> <b>of</b> property. The different expropriation methods in South African law also seem to negate the possibility that prescription amounts to expropriation. Firstly, there can be no <b>expropriation</b> by way <b>of</b> administrative action in the case of prescription, as prescription occurs by operation of law and thus in the absence of the exercise of an administrative discretion. No discretion is exercised and hence no administrative decision is taken. Secondly, it is also impossible to regard prescription as a judicial method <b>of</b> <b>expropriation,</b> as the acquisition of ownership through this legal institution does not depend on a court order. Again, this method <b>of</b> <b>expropriation</b> is possible only in circumstances where legislation specifically empowers courts to expropriate property in this manner. As to the question whether prescription perhaps entails some form <b>of</b> statutory <b>expropriation,</b> matters are slightly more complicated due to the supreme court of appeal’s recent judgment in the Agri SA case. In this decision the court merely assumed, without deciding, that statutory expropriation does form part of South African law. Nonetheless, there are convincing arguments that this method <b>of</b> <b>expropriation</b> – if it exists in South African law at all – applies only to very exceptional circumstances where legislation explicitly intends to expropriate certain specific rights in property through mere promulgation of the act and against payment of compensation. As the prescription acts do not satisfy any of these strict requirements it is very unlikely that they could qualify as a source <b>of</b> statutory <b>expropriation.</b> Finally, the authors address the question whether prescription does not perhaps entail constructive <b>expropriation</b> <b>of</b> property. Both the supreme court of appeal and the constitutional court have to date been reluctant to recognise this form of state interference in South African law. This reluctance is based on sound principles, as the FNB methodology, together with Roux’s prediction of the “telescoping effect” of the section 25 (1) arbitrariness test, leaves little – if any – room for recognising a third form of state interference alongside or in between deprivation and expropriation. Nevertheless, even if the courts should abandon the FNB methodology, it remains unlikely that constructive <b>expropriation</b> forms part <b>of</b> our law, partly due to the nature of the requirements for a valid expropriation in South African law. On the basis of all these considerations the authors conclude that it is dogmatically sounder to regard acquisitive prescription as non-arbitrary deprivation of property, which deprivation does not entail an <b>expropriation</b> <b>of</b> property. In this regard prescription forms part of the state’s normal regulatory or police power to resolve conflicting claims to property by shifting ownership – under strictly defined circumstances – from one person to another for a legitimate public purpose...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a multinational’s {{transfer of}} technology to a foreign subsidiary for the case {{where there is a}} risk <b>of</b> <b>expropriation.</b> An expropriation is assumed to give rise to competition between the parts of the previous multinational enterprise. To reduce the benefit <b>of</b> <b>expropriation,</b> the multinational generally transfers an inferior technology, even if the {{transfer of technology}} is costless. With a reduced benefit <b>of</b> <b>expropriation,</b> the multinational has to pay lower taxes to prevent expropriation. The multinational optimally transfers additional technology over time if it has a finite horizon in the country. For this case, tax payments also are shown to increase over time in a tax holiday like fashion. A chief factor in economic development is the transfer of technologies from the industrialized countries to the less developed countries. In the theoretical literature, technology transfers are frequently thought to be coincident with capital inflows. Koizumi and Kopecky (1977), for instance, assume that the rate of technology transfer increase...|$|R

40|$|In the thesis, awards {{under the}} North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) and other {{treaties}} {{that constitute the}} system of investment treaty arbitration are analysed {{with a view to}} the margin of appreciation and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> proportionality. I compare the approach by arbitral tribunals with the approach of the European Court of Human Rights in similar legal and factual situations. The focus of the analysis lies on cases regarding various forms <b>of</b> <b>expropriation.</b> I make the claim that such cases are especially suited for analysing the margin of appreciation and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> proportionality, because they are concerned with essential aspects of state sovereignty. Furthermore, I argue that the current responses of investment treaty tribunals in this area have become a challenge to the legitimacy of investment treaty arbitration. In my opinion, proper appliance by treaty tribunals of the techniques of proportionality and discretion may help sustain the legitimacy of the system...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new channel through which {{expropriation}} risk reduces capital allocation efficiency and decreases firm growth. We build an agency model of corporate disclosure when companies face risks <b>of</b> <b>expropriation.</b> The model predicts that {{in countries with}} insecure property rights, corporations mitigate the risk <b>of</b> <b>expropriation</b> by reducing transparency. We test this channel by employing a difference-in-difference approach. Using a panel of over 16, 000 firms from 84 countries, we find that transparency of companies prone to expropriation is lower in countries with insecure property rights. The reduced transparency has an adverse effect on the efficiency of capital allocation and corporate growth...|$|R
