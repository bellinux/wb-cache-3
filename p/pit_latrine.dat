25|$|The {{ventilated}} improved <b>pit</b> <b>latrine</b> (VIP) is a <b>pit</b> <b>latrine</b> {{with a black}} pipe (vent pipe) {{fitted to}} the pit and a screen (flyscreen) at the top outlet of the pipe. VIP latrines are an improvement to overcome the disadvantages of simple pit latrines, e.g. fly and mosquito nuisance and unpleasant odors. The smell is carried upwards by the chimney effect and flies are prevented from leaving the pit and spreading disease.|$|E
25|$|A {{ventilation}} improved pit (VIP) latrine adds certain {{design features}} {{to the simple}} <b>pit</b> <b>latrine</b> which reduces flies from exiting the latrine, thereby reducing the spread of diseases.|$|E
25|$|On top of {{the drop}} hole there can either be nothing (this is the {{simplest}} form of a <b>pit</b> <b>latrine)</b> or {{there can be a}} squatting pan, seat (pedestal) or bench which can be made of concrete, ceramic, plastic or wood.|$|E

25|$|Pit latrines collect {{human feces}} {{in a hole}} in the ground. The {{principle}} of a <b>pit</b> <b>latrine</b> is that all liquids that enter the pitin particular urine and water used for anal cleansingseep into the ground (the only exception are fully lined pit latrines, see below).|$|E
25|$|Fear {{of the pit}} getting filled: In some places, {{people are}} scared that their toilet pits will get filled very fast if all family members use it everyday. So they {{continue}} {{to go out to}} delay the toilet pit filling up. This is especially true {{in the case of a}} <b>pit</b> <b>latrine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another variant is the pour-{{flush toilet}} (often {{a type of}} <b>pit</b> <b>latrine).</b> This type of flush toilet has no cistern, but is flushed {{manually}} with a few litres of a small bucket. This type of low-cost toilet is common in many Asian countries. It can use as little as 2–3 litres, and this can be greywater or rainwater.|$|E

50|$|Manual {{scavenging}} {{refers to}} the unsafe and manual removal of raw (fresh and untreated) human excreta from buckets or other containers that are used as toilets or from the pits of simple <b>pit</b> <b>latrines.</b> The safe and controlled emptying of <b>pit</b> <b>latrines,</b> on the other hand, is one component of fecal sludge management.|$|R
25|$|The pit or trench can be dug {{large enough}} so that the pit {{can be used for}} many years before it fills up. When the pit becomes full, it may be emptied or the hole covered with earth and the <b>pit</b> <b>latrine</b> relocated. Pit latrines have to be located away from {{drinking}} water sources (wells, streams, etc.) to minimize the possibility of disease spread via groundwater pollution.|$|E
25|$|Fecal sludge {{management}} (FSM) requires {{safe and}} hygienic septic tank and <b>pit</b> <b>latrine</b> emptying services, {{along with the}} effective treatment of solids and liquids and the reuse of treated produce where possible. It may include a range of options including on-site and offsite treatment, and the dispersal or capture and further processing of {{the products of the}} treatment process into such as biogas, compost and energy.|$|E
25|$|A simple <b>pit</b> <b>latrine</b> uses {{no water}} seal and {{collects}} human excreta in a pit or trench. This type of toilet {{can range from}} a simple slit trench to more elaborate systems with seating or squatting pans and ventilation systems. In developed countries they are associated with camping and wilderness areas, whereas they are common in rural or peri-urban areas {{of much of the}} developing world. Pit latrines are used in emergency situations.|$|E
5000|$|A bayakou is {{a manual}} laborer who works {{to empty the}} fecal sludge out of <b>pit</b> <b>latrines</b> in Haiti, {{especially}} in larger cities, such as Port-au-Prince. The word [...] "bayakou" [...] comes from the Haitian Creole. Bayakou are subjected to social stigma for their work in manually emptying septic tanks and <b>pit</b> <b>latrines.</b>|$|R

25|$|Wood ash or sawdust {{can also}} be added {{on top of the}} feces to {{decrease}} the smell. However, this is rarely done for pit latrines (more commonly done for dry toilets) as the users find that too much hassle and generally do not expect a <b>pit</b> <b>latrine</b> to be odour free and rather put up with some smell. In the case of Arborloos it is recommended to add some leaves, soil or compost into the pit after defecation.|$|E
25|$|In many {{developing}} countries, fecal sludge is not properly managed. This {{may be due}} to a lack of mandated institutions and little awareness of the impact of poor sanitation; the lack of technical expertise and experience; inability to source funds for to purchase of vacuum trucks and treatment, or lack of knowledge required to be initiate and implement successful FSM programs. This can result in the poor performance of onsite sanitation facilities (OSSFs), septic tank and <b>pit</b> <b>latrine</b> overflows, unsafe emptying of pit latrines, and the dumping of untreated pathogenic fecal sludge into the environment.|$|E
25|$|The Citizen Report Card {{moreover}} {{indicates that}} septic tanks {{are often used}} for the disposal of wastewater from flush toilets in Mombasa. <b>Pit</b> <b>latrine</b> users from Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa indicated that some wastewater empties into storm sewers, soak-aways and cess pits designed for kitchen waste, thus causing environmental pollution. In 2001 a pollution incident occurred {{in the town of}} Embu. Raw sewage was discharged from sewage treatment works into a nearby river and caused the death of 28 people who used the water downstream for domestic purposes.|$|E

25|$|UDDTs with vaults {{are also}} more {{permanent}} structures than most <b>pit</b> <b>latrines,</b> the latter of which in rural areas are typically relocated when the pit is full rather than emptying the <b>pit.</b> Therefore, <b>pit</b> <b>latrines</b> need more space and people are less willing {{to invest in a}} higher quality super-structure as {{it will have to be}} dismantled and moved at some point.|$|R

25|$|A basic <b>pit</b> <b>latrine</b> can be {{improved}} {{in a number of}} ways. One includes adding a ventilation pipe from the pit to above the structure. This improves airflow and decreases the smell of the toilet. It also can reduce flies when the top of the pipe is covered with mesh (usually made out of fiberglass). In these types of toilets a lid need not be used to cover the hole in the floor. Other possible improvements include a floor constructed so fluid drains into the hole and a reinforcement of {{the upper part of the}} pit with bricks, blocks, or cement rings to improve stability.|$|E
25|$|Access to safe {{drinking}} water is indicated by safe water sources. These improved drinking water sources include household connection, public standpipe, borehole condition, protected dug well, protected spring, and rain water collection. Sources that do not encourage improved drinking water {{to the same extent}} as previously mentioned include: unprotected wells, unprotected springs, rivers or ponds, vender-provided water, bottled water (consequential of limitations in quantity, not quality of water), and tanker truck water. Access to sanitary water comes hand in hand with access to improved sanitation facilities for excreta, such as connection to public sewer, connection to septic system, or a <b>pit</b> <b>latrine</b> with a slab or water seal.|$|E
25|$|A <b>pit</b> <b>latrine</b> or pit toilet {{is a type}} {{of toilet}} that {{collects}} human feces in a hole in the ground. They use either no water or one to three liters per flush with pour-flush pit latrines. When properly built and maintained they can decrease the spread of disease by reducing the amount of human feces in the environment from open defecation. This decreases the transfer of pathogens between feces and food by flies. These pathogens are major causes of infectious diarrhea and intestinal worm infections. Infectious diarrhea resulted in about 700,000 deaths in children under five years old in 2011 and 250 million lost school days. Pit latrines are the lowest cost method of separating feces from people.|$|E

25|$|As a {{very general}} {{guideline}} {{it is recommended}} that the bottom of the pit should be at least 2m abovegroundwaterlevel, and a minimum horizontal distance of 30m between a pit and a water source is normally recommended to limit exposure to microbial contamination.However, no general statement should be made regarding the minimum lateral separation distances required to prevent contamination of a well from a <b>pit</b> <b>latrine.</b> For example, even 50m lateral separation distance might not be sufficient in a strongly karstified system with a downgradient supply well or spring, while 10m lateral separation distance is completely sufficient if there is a well developed clay cover layer and the annular space of the groundwater well is well sealed.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree of}} {{pathogen}} removal strongly varies with soil type, aquifer type, distance {{and other environmental}} factors. For example, the unsaturated zone becomes “washed” during extended periods of heavy rain, providing hydraulic pathway for the quick pass of pathogens. It is difficult to estimate the safe distance between a <b>pit</b> <b>latrine</b> or a septic tank and a water source. In any case, such recommendations about the safe distance are mostly ignored by those building pit latrines. In addition, household plots are of a limited size and therefore pit latrines are often built much closer to groundwater wells than what {{can be regarded as}} safe. This results in groundwater pollution and household members falling sick when using this groundwater as a source of drinking water.|$|E
