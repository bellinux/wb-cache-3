40|$|Annatto {{byproduct}} is {{the residue}} from {{the extraction of}} powder dye that covers the seed pericarp; after processing, between 94 % and 98 % of the original product is considered a byproduct. The aim was to evaluate the influence of increasing levels of annatto byproduct on the components of sheep body weight. Thirty-two male sheep, not castrated, with initial weight of 23. 17 ± 1. 45 kg, without a defined breed, were used in randomized blocks in all four treatments (0, 100, 200 and 300 g kg? 1 of annatto byproduct in the diet dry matter). The increase to 300 g kg? 1 of annatto byproduct had a negative linear effect (P < 0. 05) for hot carcass <b>weight</b> (<b>kg)</b> and cold carcass <b>weight</b> (<b>kg).</b> Increasing levels of annatto byproduct resulted in a linear reduction (P < 0. 05) for palette <b>weight</b> (<b>kg),</b> leg <b>weight</b> (<b>kg),</b> carcass compactness index (kg cm? 1), liver <b>weight</b> (<b>kg)</b> and skin <b>weight</b> (<b>kg).</b> The inclusion of annatto byproduct up to 200 g kg? 1 of dry matter in sheep diets {{did not affect the}} components of sheep body weight...|$|R
