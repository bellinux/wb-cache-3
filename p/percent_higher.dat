5|$|Although {{the group}} of people at risk for SAH is younger than the {{population}} usually affected by stroke, the risk still increases with age. Young people are much less likely than middle-age people (risk ratio 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk continues to rise with age and is 60 <b>percent</b> <b>higher</b> in the very elderly (over 85) than in those between 45 and 55. Risk of SAH is about 25 <b>percent</b> <b>higher</b> in women over 55 compared to men the same age, probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the menopause, such as a decrease in estrogen levels.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSignal-averaged electrocardiograms (X, Y and Z leads) were {{acquired}} from 24 patients with {{coronary artery disease}} and recurrent ventricular tachycardia, 24 control patients with coronary artery disease and 23 normal subjects to assess the discriminant value of fast Fourier transformation of the entire late potential period of the QRS complex. Analysis of the vector magnitude in the temporal domain (25 to 250 Hz bandpass filters) measured high frequency QRS duration, the duration of terminal signals 25 Hz that were < 40 μV. Analysis in the frequency domain used a 120 ms window that encompassed (had onset with) all of the late potential, but the mean value was first subtracted to eliminate a direct current component. High frequency spectral areas (60 to 120 Hz) and the <b>percent</b> <b>high</b> frequency (100 × [60 to 120 Hz/ 0 to 120 Hz]) were calculated. Results in both temporal and frequency domains were similar in control patients with coronary artery disease and normal subjects. Patients with ventricular tachycardia had a longer high frequency QRS complex (p < 0. 0001) and longer high frequency terminal signals < 40 μV (p < 0. 0004), but not significantly lower voltage in the last 40 ms. The most useful temporal domain measurement was high frequency QRS duration (if ≥ 120 ms, odds ratio = 8. 2). Patients with ventricular tachycardia had increased high frequency spectral areas (p < 0. 0002) in the late potential, and the <b>percent</b> <b>high</b> frequency was especially increased (p = 0. 0000; if <b>percent</b> <b>high</b> frequency ≥ 3. 1 %, odds ratio = 18. 4). The odds ratio and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were both greater for <b>percent</b> <b>high</b> frequency than for high frequency QRS duration (p < 0. 03. All patients with ventricular tachycardia had a high frequency QRS complex ≥ 107 ms or <b>percent</b> <b>high</b> frequency ≥ 3. 1 % (sensitivity 100 %). For a high frequency QRS complex ≥ 107 ms and <b>percent</b> <b>high</b> frequency ≥ 3. 1 %, specificity was 96 %. Therefore, high frequencies in late potentials, not their duration or reduced voltage, most usefully identify patients with coronary artery disease who are prone to ventricular tachycardia...|$|R

5|$|The 2010 census {{estimated}} that 1,057 people in Omak have attended college, while 504 residents received an academic degree; {{more than five}} <b>percent</b> <b>higher</b> than the state average. Approximately 91.5 percent {{graduated from high school}} or a more advanced institution; two <b>percent</b> <b>higher</b> than the state average. Omak's schools are administered by the county's largest educational district, Omak School District, which operate two mainstream high schools, one mainstream middle school, two mainstream elementary schools and three virtual schools. Omak High School, built in 1919, had a 2010–11 enrollment of 435 students, while the Omak Alternative High School had an enrollment of 48 students. In contrast to the municipal average as a whole with 2,540 females and 2,305 males, Omak Alternative High School had 28 males and 20 females attending the institution. Omak Middle School, with an enrolment of 339 children, had 171 males and 169 females in the 2010–11 school season. The city's primary schools are East Omak Elementary and North Omak Elementary which had a combined 2010–11 enrollment of 748 children.|$|E
5|$|The five-officer Omak Police Department detachment, which {{covered the}} {{municipality}} and nearby rural communities, reported over 180 criminal code offenses in 2010. The city's crime rate of 154 offenses per 100,000 people is 28 <b>percent</b> <b>higher</b> than the 2010 state average and one <b>percent</b> <b>higher</b> than the 2010 federal average. According to Uniform Crime Report statistics {{compiled by the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 2011, there were 19 violent crimes and 166 property crimes. The violent crimes consisted of one forcible rape, three robberies and 15 aggravated assaults, while 32 burglaries, 104 larceny-thefts, eight motor vehicle thefts and one arson defined the property crimes. The FBI classifies Omak as having 4,921 people located within the Omak Police Department area. The city's highest crime rate was recorded in 2004, with 413 incidents per 100,000 people. Until 2013, when a murder and motor-vehicle theft occurred in the city, {{there had not been}} a homicide for over ten consecutive years. The crime in Omak has decreased throughout the past decade. Before marijuana was legalized in Washington, marijuana users were arrested, per state law. Growers, drug lords and international smugglers residing in the Omak area are still arrested.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, the U.S. {{trucking}} industry employed 1.8million {{drivers of}} heavy trucks. A {{major problem for}} the long-haul trucking industry is that {{a large percentage of}} these drivers are aging, and are expected to retire. Very few new hires are expected in the near future, resulting in a driver shortage. , within the long-haul sector, there is an estimated shortage of 20,000 drivers. That shortage was projected to increase to 111,000 by 2014, however the actual shortage of truck drivers in 2014 was around 38,000. The trucking industry (especially the long-haul sector) is also facing an image crisis due to the long working hours, long periods of time away from home, the dangerous nature of the work, and the average earnings compared to other forms of labor (such as construction, which was 1 <b>percent</b> <b>higher</b> than trucking in 2004).|$|E
40|$|Background Our {{goal was}} to compare {{hospital}} scores from {{the most widely used}} commercial website in the USA to hospital scores from more systematic measures of patient experience and outcomes, and to assess what drives variation in the commercial website scores. Methods For a national sample of US hospitals, we compared scores on Yelp. com, which aggregates website visitor ratings (1 - 5 stars), with traditional measures of hospital quality. We calculated correlations between hospital Yelp scores and the following: hospital <b>percent</b> <b>high</b> ratings (9 or 10, scale 0 - 10) on the 'Overall' item on the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey; hospital individual HCAHPS domain scores (eg, nurse communication, pain control); hospital 30 -day mortality; and hospital 30 -day readmission rates. Results Of hospitals reporting HCAHPS (n= 3796), 962 (25 %) had scores on Yelp. Among hospitals with > 5 Yelp ratings, the correlation of <b>percent</b> <b>high</b> ratings between Yelp and HCAHPS was 0. 49 (p < 0. 001). The <b>percent</b> <b>high</b> ratings within each HCAHPS domain increased monotonically with increasing Yelp scores (p≤ 0. 001 for all domains). <b>Percent</b> <b>high</b> ratings in Yelp and HCAHPS were statistically significantly correlated with lower mortality for myocardial infarction (MI; - 0. 19 for Yelp and - 0. 13 for HCAHPS) and pneumonia (- 0. 14 and - 0. 18), and fewer readmissions for MI (- 0. 17 and - 0. 39), heart failure (- 0. 31 and - 0. 39), and pneumonia (- 0. 18 and - 0. 27). Conclusions These data suggest that rater experiences for Yelp and HCAHPS may be similar, and that consumers posting ratings on Yelp may observe aspects of care related to important patient outcomes...|$|R

5|$|The euro is the second-most {{widely held}} reserve {{currency}} after the U.S. dollar. After its introduction on 4 January 1999 its exchange rate {{against the other}} major currencies fell reaching its lowest exchange rates in 2000 (25 October vs the U.S. dollar, 26 October vs Japanese Yen, 3 May vs Pound Sterling). Afterwards it regained and its exchange rate reached its historical highest point in 2008 (15 July vs U.S. dollar, 23 July vs Japanese Yen, 29 December vs Pound Sterling). With {{the advent of the}} global financial crisis the euro initially fell, only to regain later. Despite pressure due to the European sovereign-debt crisis the euro remained stable.

5|$|The {{sale of the}} Olympic brand {{has been}} controversial. The {{argument}} is that the Games have become indistinguishable from any other commercialised sporting spectacle. Specific criticism was levelled at the IOC for market saturation during the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Games. The cities were awash in corporations and merchants attempting to sell Olympic-related wares. The IOC {{indicated that they would}} address this to prevent spectacles of over-marketing at future Games. Another criticism is that the Games are funded by host cities and national governments; the IOC incurs none of the cost, yet controls all the rights and profits from the Olympic symbols. The IOC also takes a percentage of all sponsorship and broadcast income. Host cities continue to compete ardently for the right to host the Games, even though there is no certainty that they will earn back their investments. Research has shown that trade is around 30 <b>percent</b> <b>higher</b> for countries that have hosted the Olympics.|$|E
