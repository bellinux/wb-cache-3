40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} pressing a small shaped piece with a diaphragm made from light inertial material, intended {{for use as a}} tandem shaped charge principal warhead. The general requirements for the pressing moulds are shown. The pressing method for the small shaped piece is described {{with the use of the}} high explosive OKFOL. It concerns the pressed explosive mass, the method of mould lubrication, pressing pressure, the number of pressing steps, the method of removal of the pressed small shaped piece from the mould, and the proportions of the granulated to crushed OKFOL and its density after pressing. Very high, measured densities of the pressed OKFOL in the small shaped piece at different cross-sections (bottom − top of the shaped piece) 1. 761 - 1. 813 g/cm 3, i. e. (95. 5 - 98. 3) % of the calculated theoretical density of 1. 84 g/cm 3 were obtained for the explosive with a <b>phlegmatizer</b> content of 3. 6 %. During the trials the following damage can occur: cracking along the side of the cone, breaking off of some of the cylinder surface, breaking away of the shaped piece bottom during extraction. The accuracy of the shaped pieces produced, particularly their coaxiality, ensured the proper function of the tandem shaped charge warhead...|$|E

50|$|The {{instability}} of NI3 and NI3 · NH3 {{can be attributed}} to the large steric strain caused by the three large iodine atoms being held in proximity to each other around the relatively tiny nitrogen atom. This results in a very low activation energy for its decomposition, a reaction made even more favorable due to the great stability of N2. Nitrogen triiodide has no practical commercial value due to its extreme shock sensitivity, making it impossible to store, transport, and utilize for controlled explosions. Whereas pure nitroglycerin is also greatly shock-sensitive (although not nearly as much so as nitrogen triiodide, which can be set off with the touch of a feather) and powerful, it was only due to <b>phlegmatizers</b> that its shock sensitivity was reduced and it became safer to handle and transport in the form of dynamite.|$|R
