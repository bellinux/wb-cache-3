5|$|As the {{commander}} of the Permanent Municipal Guard Corps, Luís Alves brought order to the streets of Rio de Janeiro, through his own skill and through partnership with the city's chief of police, Eusébio de Queirós. Luís Alves was promoted from major to lieutenant colonel on 12 September 1837. Eusébio de Queirós {{was a member of the}} Partido Regressista (Reactionary Party), which had come to <b>power</b> <b>that</b> year. Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, one of the leading Reactionaries and a government minister, attempted to attract Luís Alves to his party.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{generators}} {{mounted on}} each of the E-3's four engines provide the one megawatt of electrical <b>power</b> <b>that</b> is required by the E-3's radars and other electronics. Its pulse-Doppler radar (PD) has a range of more than 250mi (400km) for low-flying targets at its operating altitude, and the pulse (BTH) radar has a range of approximately 400mi (650km) for aircraft flying at medium to high altitudes. The radar, combined with an SSR, and electronic support measures (ESM), provides a look down capability, to detect, identify, and track low-flying aircraft, while eliminating ground clutter (radar) returns.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{kept his}} {{pledge not to}} run for re-election, retired {{to his home in}} Ohio, and became an {{advocate}} of social and educational reform. Biographer Ari Hoogenboom said his greatest achievement was to restore popular faith in the presidency and to reverse the deterioration of executive <b>power</b> <b>that</b> had set in after Abraham Lincoln's death. Although supporters have praised his commitment to civil service reform and defense of civil rights, Hayes is generally listed among the high-end of the bottom half in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.|$|E
5|$|If we are {{dedicated}} to this—and to this we are—you, my fellow Canadians, will require all the wisdom, all the <b>power</b> <b>that</b> comes from those spiritual springs that make freedom possible—all the wisdom, all the faith and all the vision which the Conservative Party gave but yesterday under Macdonald, change to meet changing conditions, today having the responsibility of this party to lay the foundations of this nation for a great and glorious future.|$|E
5|$|Kenyon {{taught that}} Christ's {{substitutionary}} atonement secured for believers {{a right to}} divine healing. This was attained through positive, faith-filled speech; the spoken word of God allowed believers to appropriate the same spiritual <b>power</b> <b>that</b> God used to create the world and attain the provisions promised in Christ's death and resurrection. Prayer was understood to be a binding, legal act. Rather than asking, Kenyon taught believers to demand healing since they were already legally entitled to receive it.|$|E

She finds that while there are significant economies of scale in the industry, the barriers to entry are not high and regardless of the extent of market <b>power</b> <b>that</b> US firms have in the industry, the optimal policy is actually an export tax, rather than a subsidy.|$|E

Similarly, author Darlene Wade connects the song's lyrical content to the power within the soul, however also with the inclusion of God.|$|E
