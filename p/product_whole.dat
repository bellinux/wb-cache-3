30|$|This Step determines if the {{assessment}} of the cumulative exposures can be evaluated using toxicity data for a specific mixture of chemicals. The step reflects the relative importance of whole mixture toxicity data in assessments of combined exposures. When performing an assessment of combined exposures to a discrete mixture, such as a formulated consumer <b>product,</b> <b>whole</b> mixture toxicity data has historically been given a higher priority than component-based approaches for human health [4, 10]. The reason for preferring whole mixture data is that such data capture any effects due to interactions that may occur between chemicals and contributions from compounds that have not been measured or for which toxicity information is lacking (e.g. formulation additives in plant protection products) [11].|$|E

40|$|The pathway for the {{anaerobic}} catabolism of {{gallic acid}} by Eubacterium oxidoreducans was studied by using both in vivo and cell-free systems. Cells grown with gallate and crotonate, {{but with no}} formate or H 2, excreted pyrogallol and phloroglucinol into the medium. Gallate was decarboxylated by crude cell extracts, with pyrogallol as the only detectable <b>product.</b> <b>Whole</b> cells converted pyrogallol to phloroglucinol. A phloroglucinol reductase catalyzed the conversion of phloroglucinol to dihydrophloroglucinol when NADPH {{was used as the}} source of electrons. Both formate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 2, 1. 43) and hydrogenase (EC 1. 18. 99. 1) were present in cell extracts of gallate-formate-grown cells. These two enzymes were both NADP linked. Since either H 2 or formate is required for cell growth with galiate or phloroglucinol, these results suggest that the oxidation of the reduced substrate may be indirectly linked to the reduction of phloroglucinol. A dihydrophloroglucinol hydrolase was present, which hydrolyzed dihydrophloroglucinol to 3 -hydroxy- 5 -oxohexanoate. This six-carbon ring cleavage product then presumably can be broken down by a series of reactions similar to n-oxidation. These reactions cleaved the six-carbon acid to 3 -hydroxybutyryl-coenzyme A yielding acetate and butyrate as end products. A number of key enzymes involved in n-oxidation and substrate-level phosphorylation were demonstrated in cell extracts. Recently, Eubacterium oxidoreducens ("Eubacteriu...|$|E

As a consequence of strict price regulation policies enforced {{by the government in}} the poultry products, PROAGRO experienced serious injury to its profitability over the last few years. The most severe regulations were applied to PROAGRO's chief <b>product</b> (<b>whole,</b> ready-to-cook broiler with feet and giblets incorporated in the body cavity); therefore, PROAGRO's management has concentrated research efforts to find alternative ways to increase sales of products with larger margins through the most profitable distribution channels. At the present time the distribution channel with the biggest margin for broilers is through the restaurants specializing in broilers. PROAGRO sells 8 percent of its products to this kind of establishment, but recent efforts to increase distribution in these channels have had limited success due to intense competition from other poultry firms. An alternate way to increase broiler sales through "away-from-home" channels would be through an owned (or controlled) chain operation with high sales volume per unit. To accomplish this it would be necessary to offer faster service and lower prices of the products. These factors have been the basis of the fast-food concept developed successfully in the American market. This report will focus on the development of research methodology appropriate for (1) analyzing the Venezuelan market potential for fast-food poultry products and (2) evaluating PROAGRO's likelihood of increasing profits through entry into this business.

Indeed, they have a requirement to gain a greater understanding of the Cost of Disposal, in order to secure future contracts with MoD in the UK, which ranges across land, sea and air projects. In response, {{the purpose of this study}} is to develop a Generic Framework for Estimation of the Cost of Disposal, identifying all requirements, inputs and best practices techniques for a major defence company. Current cost estimation methods appear to miss out some of the uncertainties involved, or simply assumes a triangular distribution with a default setting of plus or minus 10 %. In order to address this current poor consideration of all cost uncertainties, more than 200 academic papers have been reviewed to develop a structured Framework, which provides the necessary level of information to generate a more appropriate evaluation of the true Cost of Disposal for a range of industries, including Defence, Aerospace, Marine, Nuclear, Oil & Chemical and Automotive.

40|$|The aim of {{this report}} was to {{investigate}} whether the diagnosis of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection by serology might be feasible and useful. Among the various viral proteins, the FeLV env-gene product (SU) and the envelope transmembrane protein p 15 E were considered promising candidates for the serological diagnosis of FeLV infection. Thus, we evaluated p 15 E and three other FeLV antigens, namely, a recombinant env-gene <b>product,</b> <b>whole</b> FeLV, and a short peptide from the FeLV transmembrane protein, for their potential to detect FeLV infection. To evaluate possible exposure of cats to FeLV, we tested serum and plasma samples from experimentally and naturally infected and vaccinated cats {{for the presence of}} antibodies to these antigens by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The serological results were compared with the p 27 and proviral real-time PCR results. We found that p 15 E displayed a diagnostic sensitivity of 95. 7 % and a specificity of 100 % in experimentally infected cats. In naturally infected cats, p 15 E showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 77. 1 % and a specificity of 85. 6 %. Vaccinated cats displayed minimal antibody levels to p 15 E, suggesting that anti-p 15 E antibodies indicate infection rather than vaccination. The other antigens turned out to be too unspecific. The lower specificity in cats exposed to FeLV under field conditions may be {{explained by the fact that}} some cats become infected and seroconvert in the absence of detectable viral nucleic acids in plasma. We conclude that p 15 E serology may become a valuable tool for diagnosing FeLV infection; in some cases, it may replace PCR...|$|E

40|$|Children {{and adults}} {{frequently}} skip breakfast and rates are currently increasing. In addition, the food choices made for breakfast {{are not always}} healthy ones. Breakfast skipping, in conjunction with unhealthy breakfast choices, leads to impaired cognitive functioning, poor nutrient intake, and overweight. In response to these public health issues, Skip To Breakfast, a behaviorally based school and family program, was created to increase consistent and healthful breakfast consumption among ethnically diverse fifth grade students and their families, using Intervention Mapping™. Four classroom lessons and four parent newsletters were used to deliver the intervention. For this project, a healthy, 2 ̆ 23 Star Breakfast 2 ̆ 2 was promoted, and included a serving each of dairy <b>product,</b> <b>whole</b> grain, and fruit, each {{with an emphasis on}} being low in fat and sugar. The goal of this project was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. A pilot-test of the intervention was conducted in one classroom, in a school in Houston, during the Fall 2007 semester. A qualitative evaluation of the intervention was conducted, which included focus groups with students, phone interviews of parents, process evaluation data from the classroom teacher, and direct observation. Sixteen students and six parents participated in the study. Data were recorded and themes were identified. Initial results showed {{there is a need for}} such programs. Based on the initial feedback, edits were made to the intervention and program. Results showed high acceptability among the teacher, students, and parents. It became apparent that students were not reliably getting the parent newsletters to their parents to read, so a change to the protocol was made, in which students will receive incentives for having parents read newsletters and return signed forms, to increase parent participation. Other changes included small modifications to the curriculum, such as, clarifying instructions, changing in-class assignments to homework assignments, and including background reading materials for the teacher. The main trial is planned to be carried out in Spring 2008, in two elementary schools, utilizing four, fifth grade classes from each, with one school acting as the control and one as the intervention school. Results from this study can be used as an adjunct to the Coordinated Approach To Child Health (CATCH) program. ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the initial {{findings of a}} survey of 52 craft breweries (brewpubs, microbreweries, and regional breweries) in the states of Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. The head brewer or owner/operator was surveyed to determine the craft brewing industries’ level of interest in purchasing locally grown and produced grains and locally produced malt, {{as well as the}} procurement needs for the ingredients they purchase. The craft brewing industry, which mushroomed in the early to mid 1990 ’s, slowed to a crawl in the late 1990 ’s, however, the industry began to rebound in 2000 as volume for craft brewers increased substantially. The breweries in this study were very optimistic about the future of craft brewery industry with all of the surveyed breweries believing that demand will grow in the foreseeable future. The vast majority of the breweries (81 %) feel the need to investigate new markets in order to survive in the craft brewing industry. The need for breweries to investigate new markets may be an opportunity for producers and craft breweries to partner and develop a market for beer that is produced with locally grown and produced ingredients and/or malt. Fifty-nine percent of the breweries were very or extremely interested in making the claim that their beer was made with grains produced or grown locally with 31 % indicating that they were extremely interested. The survey also assessed the breweries’ level of interest in making the claim that the malt used in their brewing process was produced locally. Again, the majority (59 %) of breweries were very or extremely interested in making this claim. In order to supply craft breweries with ingredients and malt, it is necessary to understand their procurement needs. The breweries overwhelmingly prefer to purchase malt made with two-row barley (94 % mention) rather than six-row barley (2 % mention). A brewery’s malt needs can be broken down into the base and specialty malt that the brewery purchases to brew its beer. The breweries were surveyed on their use of four principle types of base malt: whole kernel, preground, dry malt extract, and syrup malt extract. Whole kernel malt was the most prevalent type of base malt used with 84 % of the brewpubs, 92 % of the microbreweries, and all of the regional breweries using this <b>product.</b> <b>Whole</b> Kernel Malt was also the predominant specialty malt used with 81 % of the brewpubs, 85 % of the microbreweries, and all of the regional breweries using this product. In order to supply the brewery industry, {{it is important to know}} the size of the malt market. Brewpubs use an average of 45, 000 pounds of whole kernel base malt per year, while microbreweries use an average of 206, 000 pounds annually. Regional breweries use over two million pounds of whole kernel base malt annually on average. In an example given of converting pounds of malt to acres of planted barley, 175 acres of barley could supply nearly three “typical” microbreweries with their annual supply of base malt. In order to supply a brewery, it is important to understand the characteristics that surround a brewery’s malt purchases. Some of these characteristics include: the typical malt order size; the type of packaging preferred by the breweries; their order frequency; where the breweries purchase their malt and how it is shipped to them. These characteristics were assessed for both base and specialty malt purchases and are described in detail in the report. A significant number of brewpubs and microbreweries receive their base and specialty malt through a malt distributor. In addition, the smaller breweries typically order in smaller quantities (possibly paying a higher premium) and order less frequently (possibly to lower their distribution costs and meet minimum order sizes). By ordering on a less frequent basis these breweries may, at times, be forced to use a malt that is not as fresh as they would like to use. This dilemma may present an opportunity to supply these types of breweries. In order to successfully compete in the brewing industry, a producer or producer owned maltster has to meet the needs of its customers (breweries). Four categories of procurement needs or attributes were assessed in the survey for their degree of importance in a brewery’s purchasing decisions. The categories included physical properties, chemical properties, services offered, and price. Among all of the categories, “recourse for poor malt quality”, “timeliness of delivery”, “consistency of taste”, and “malt freshness” were the top ranked attributes in their importance to all breweries. Each of these attributes had an average score of at least 9 (on a scale of 1 - 10) or a ranking of “extremely important” by all breweries. Looking at the microbrewery segment, protein/nitrogen level and moister content were had an average score of 9. 0 or above (extremely important), while malt analysis was extremely important to regional breweries. It is interesting to note that price (mean score of 7. 92) was ranked fifteenth in importance among all breweries and seventeenth (mean of 7. 57) among brewpubs. Although malted barley is the main grain used in the brewing of beer, there are many other ingredients that are part of the brewing process. The most common of these “other ingredients” is wheat. More than 90 % of the surveyed breweries brew wheat beer. The vast majority of the breweries (65 %) prefer to purchase their wheat malted, while 23 % prefer to purchase wheat in a raw form. It was estimated that it would take more than 2, 800 acres of wheat to supply all (malted and non-malted) of the wheat beer breweries in the six-state region including 700 acres to supply Colorado and Nebraska wheat breweries. Overall, 90 % of the breweries agreed with the statement that consumer demand for wheat beer would continue to grow. Other ingredients used to brew beer include oats, rye and corn. Thirty-seven percent of the breweries use some form of oats in their brewing process. Thirty-one percent use rye, flaked rye, or rye hulls, while 13 % purchase varieties of corn. Four percent of the breweries manufacture a beer that is brewed with organic ingredients...|$|E
