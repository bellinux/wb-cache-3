5|$|The {{policy was}} promulgated by Thomas Jefferson in 1801, in {{reference}} to a 1796 address by George Washington. Despite its enduring influence on U.S. foreign-policy discussions, Washington said <b>privately</b> <b>that</b> the view on which his pronouncements were based would probably be irrelevant in 20 years due to a changing geopolitical situation.|$|E
5|$|Although Ethel made {{a return}} visit to England in 1948 to shop and visit family and friends, Wodehouse never left America {{after his arrival}} in 1947. It was not until 1965 that the British {{government}} indicated <b>privately</b> <b>that</b> he could return without fear of legal proceedings, and by then he felt too old to make the journey. The biographers Benny Green and Robert McCrum both take the view that this exile benefited Wodehouse's writing, helping him to go on depicting an idealised England seen in his mind's eye, rather than as it actually was in the post-war decades.|$|E
5|$|Despite that, the {{government}} has stated that the issue might be addressed if France were to be offered something of equal value. The Council itself has indicated <b>privately</b> <b>that</b> it would discuss the Strasbourg seat only if Parliament gives them a signal to start a debate, as they would not do on their own initiative. However, few wish {{to discuss the issue}} while the current constitutional issues are still present. Although political parties have no formal position, the Greens, Liberals and Socialists are all outspoken on having Brussels as a permanent seat.|$|E

5|$|According to Nick Davies in The Guardian, the {{statement}} {{was the result of}} an intense argument in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both the Met and IPCC said {{the statement}} represented the truth as they understood it at the time, and that there had been no allegation at that point that Tomlinson had come into contact with police. Davies asked why the IPCC were involved if they had not realized there had been police contact. He alleged that senior sources within the Met said <b>privately</b> <b>that</b> the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a statement saying they had checked with every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and that none of them had called in such a report.|$|E
5|$|Another {{burden of}} his {{promotion}} to First Lord of the Admiralty was that St Vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers {{and their relatives}} and friends. Soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. The more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. Despite St Vincent having declared both publicly and <b>privately</b> <b>that</b> officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the Admiralty.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{months after}} Percy Jackson's defense of Mount Olympus in The Last Olympian, Percy finds himself alone {{and on the}} run from monsters in {{southern}} California without his memories. Under the initial guidance of Lupa, the wolf-goddess and protector of ancient Rome, he makes his way toward Camp Jupiter, the Roman demigod training camp and counterpart to the Greek demigod's Camp Half-Blood. Upon arriving, he is again attacked by several Gorgons, (Stheno and Euryale) and successfully defends a disguised goddess Juno as well as the camp {{with the help of the}} guards on duty. Because he protected her during the attack, Juno announces his arrival with her approval, identifying that Percy is a son of Neptune. She further tells him <b>privately</b> <b>that</b> he can only regain his memory by learning to be a hero again and successfully survive the challenges he encounters at camp.|$|E

25|$|Some {{banks in}} Hong Kong were {{reported}} to be considering relocation if the proposed Article 23 is passed, out of the fear that the laws would restrict {{the free flow of}} information. On 7 December 2002, it was reported in the press that ten foreign banks had told the government <b>privately</b> <b>that</b> the introduction of Article 23 would have disastrous consequences for Hong Kong, threatening its demise as Asia's financial capital.|$|E

25|$|The papal nuncio to France conferred {{with the}} American {{ambassador}} in Paris, Benjamin Franklin, {{as to how}} the issue might be resolved {{in a way that would}} be acceptable to the United States. Franklin responded by saying that the official separation of Church and State in the United States did not permit the government to have any official opinion on who should govern American Catholics. He suggested <b>privately</b> <b>that</b> perhaps a French bishop might be given oversight of the small but growing Catholic community in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|In late 1938, {{during the}} great crisis in Europe over Czechoslovakia that culminated in the Munich Agreement, Canadians were divided. Francophones insisted on neutrality, as did some top {{advisers}} like Oscar D. Skelton. Imperialists stood behind Britain and were willing to fight Germany. King, who served as his own {{secretary of state for}} external affairs (foreign minister), said <b>privately</b> <b>that</b> if he had to choose he would not be neutral, but he made no public statement. All of Canada was relieved that the British appeasement at Munich, while sacrificing the rights of Czechoslovakia, seemed to bring peace.|$|E
25|$|Abkhazians began mass {{acquisition}} of Russian passports in 2002. It is {{reported that the}} public organisation the Congress of Russian Communities of Abkhazia started collecting Abkhazians’ Soviet-era travel documents. It then sent them to a consular department specially set up by Russian Foreign Ministry officials {{in the city of}} Sochi. After they were checked, Abkhazian applicants were granted Russian citizenship. By 25 June 2002, an estimated 150,000 people in Abkhazia had acquired the new passports, joining 50,000 who already possessed Russian citizenship. The Sukhum authorities, although officially not involved in the registration for Russian nationality process, openly encouraged it. Government officials said <b>privately</b> <b>that</b> President Putin’s administration agreed with the passport acquisition during Abkhazia’s prime minister Djergenia's visit to Moscow in May 2002.|$|E

25|$|At Bishop Auckland, {{where two}} of his {{children}} were born, Frankland confined himself to his parochial duties. After the Restoration {{he was one of}} the first to be attacked for nonconformity. His living was in the bishop's gift, but John Cosin (consecrated 2 December 1660) did not interfere with a peaceable man. An attorney named Bowster demanded of him, ‘publickly before the congregation,’ whether he intended to conform. Frankland thought it would be time to answer this question when the terms of conformity had been settled; and meanwhile relied on the king's declaration (25 October 1660) dispensing with conformity. Bowster, with a neighbouring clergyman, got possession of the keys and locked Frankland out of his church. He indicted them for riot, but the case was dismissed at the assizes for a technical flaw in the indictment. Cosin now offered to institute Frankland and give him higher preferment if he would receive episcopal ordination. He even proposed, but without result, to ordain him conditionally, and ‘so <b>privately</b> <b>that</b> the people might not know of it.’ By the act of 1661 Frankland was confirmed in the possession of his living; but the uniformity act of the following year ejected him.|$|E

The proposal, dubbed [...] "Operation Sandwedge", called for a budget of $500,000, primarily to cover private investigative work and security for the Republican National Convention, however Caulfield intimated <b>privately</b> <b>that</b> it would also include electronic surveillance.|$|E
500|$|Out of office, Fillmore {{continued}} his law practice and made long-neglected repairs to his Buffalo home. He remained {{a major political}} figure, leading the committee of notables that welcomed John Quincy Adams to Buffalo, and the former president expressed his regret at Fillmore's absence from the halls of Congress. Some urged Fillmore to run for vice president with Clay, the consensus Whig choice for president in 1844—Horace Greeley wrote <b>privately</b> <b>that</b> [...] "my own first choice has long been Millard Fillmore"—others thought Fillmore should try to win back the governor's mansion for the Whigs. Fillmore wanted the vice presidency, {{and it did not}} take him long after he came back from Washington for him to seek to return there in that capacity.|$|E

500|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1840s, {{individuals}} of black African descent were prohibited from ordination to the LDS Church's priesthood, normally held by all male members who meet church standards of spiritual [...] "worthiness", and from receiving temple ordinances such as the endowment and celestial marriage (sealing). The origins of the policy are still unclear; during the 20th century, most church members and leaders believed the policy had originated during founding prophet Joseph Smith's time, but church research in the 1960s and 1970s {{found no evidence of}} the prohibition before the presidency of Brigham Young. LDS Church presidents Heber J. Grant and David O. McKay are known to have stated <b>privately</b> <b>that</b> the restriction was a temporary one that would be lifted later by a divine revelation to a church president.|$|E

As Kurt arrives back at McKinley, the Dalton Academy Warblers glee club that he had joined while he was away—fronted by his boyfriend Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss)—serenades him in farewell with a rendition of Keane's [...] "Somewhere Only We Know".

500|$|In June 1911, {{as part of}} the {{celebrations}} surrounding the coronation of King George V, Elgar was appointed to the Order of Merit, an honour limited to twenty-four holders at any time. The following year, the Elgars moved back to London, to a large house in Netherhall Gardens, Hampstead, designed by Norman Shaw. There Elgar composed his last two large-scale works of the pre-war era, the choral ode, The Music Makers (for the Birmingham Festival, 1912) and the symphonic study Falstaff (for the Leeds Festival, 1913). Both were received politely but without enthusiasm. Even the dedicatee of Falstaff, the conductor Landon Ronald, confessed <b>privately</b> <b>that</b> he could not [...] "make head or tail of the piece," [...] while the musical scholar Percy Scholes wrote of Falstaff that it was a [...] "great work" [...] but, [...] "so far as public appreciation goes, a comparative failure." ...|$|E
