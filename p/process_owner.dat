50|$|In a milder form, the proponent (or <b>process</b> <b>owner)</b> of an {{activity}} {{accused of being}} NVA is simply informed that it is seen in that light.

40|$|Abstract—Today’s {{extensive}} {{business process}} landscapes make {{it necessary to}} handle the execution {{of a large number}} of workflows. Especially if workflow steps require the invocation of resource-intensive applications or a large number of applications needs to be carried out concurrently, <b>process</b> <b>owners</b> may have to allocate extensive computational resources, leading to high fixed costs. Instead, <b>process</b> <b>owners</b> could make use of Cloud-based computational resources, dynamically leasing and releasing resources on demand, which could lead to lower costs. In the work at hand, we propose a resource-efficient workflow scheduling algorithm for business processes and Cloud-based computational resources. Through the integration into the Vienna Platform for Elastic Processes and an evaluation, we show the practical applicability and the benefits of our contributions. Specifically, we find that our approach reduces the resource demand if compared with an ad hoc approach...|$|R

Marcelite Harris’s career included many “firsts”, as {{she was the first}} female aircraft maintenance officer, one of the first two female air officers commanding at the United States Air Force Academy, and the Air Force’s first female Director of Maintenance. She served as a White House social aide during the Carter administration. Her service medals and decorations include the Bronze Star, the Presidential Unit Citation, and the Vietnam Service Medal. Harris retired as a major general in 1997, the highest ranking female officer in the Air Force and the Nation’s highest ranking African American woman in the Department of Defense. Upon retirement from the Air Force, Harris served NASA as the Florida Site Director and Logistics <b>Process</b> <b>Owner</b> for United Space Alliance, the company managing the Nation’s Shuttle Program. Besides her Spelman B.A., she holds a B.S. in Business Management from the University of Maryland University College. In 1999, Harris was awarded an Honorary Doctorate Degree from Spelman College.

40|$|Business Process Management, {{both as a}} {{managerial}} {{discipline and}} its supportive information and communication technology, is becoming a concern for many business practitioners and research workers. As organizations develop their processes via modelling, simulation, implementation and continuous improvement, they may demand suitable workforce to secure these initiatives such as <b>process</b> <b>owners,</b> business analysts, <b>process</b> analysts etc. This fact puts demands on higher education institutions to provide these competencies and teach their students. Moreover, to provide quality education and research, universities themselves may utilize benefits of Business Process Management. The main goal {{of this paper is}} thus to explore the current state of Business Process Management utilization among Czech higher education institutions. Its purpose is to answer the research questions of how do universities in the Czech Republic apply process approach and what process maturity do they achieve?

40|$|Process {{owners are}} vital to the {{establishment}} and functioning of process oriented organizations. However, there is a paucity of understanding regarding the tasks process owners should undertake and what competencies they require. In this study, sets of <b>process</b> <b>owner</b> competencies and <b>process</b> <b>owner</b> tasks emerged from interviews with executives from three financial services organizations in South Africa. The findings were compared to the BPTrends report “State of the Business Process Management Market 2016 ”. Common themes were identified and validated against recent literature. Based on the validated themes a business <b>process</b> <b>owner</b> competency framework was developed and discussed. The framework shows that business process owners require competencies in core business process management, strategic alignment, determining organizational goals, governance, documentation, training, and systemic thinking. The competencies and tasks identified provide a practical contribution to practitioners and recruiters in the field, while the framework adds a theoretical contribution {{to the field of}} business process management...|$|E
30|$|In the ‘governance and {{strategic}} alignment’ category, {{we found that}} all four reasons are differently important for routine and nonroutine processes. The reason that a process has no defined <b>process</b> <b>owner</b> {{is very important for}} routine and extremely important for nonroutine processes. In our opinion, this makes sense as the unpredictability of nonroutine processes requires process owners who strongly coordinate process participants and stakeholders (Hammer and Stanton 1999). The reason that the <b>process</b> <b>owner</b> is equipped with insufficient authority is a special case. It is the only reason where the median is equal for routine and nonroutine processes, but the modus and the statistics point to different importance. Thus, we treat this reason as extremely important for nonroutine processes, but also recommend further investigation. This finding complies with the previous reason, supporting that it is crucial for nonroutine processes to not only define a <b>process</b> <b>owner,</b> but also to equip this role with sufficient authority and decision rights. Whereas the <b>process</b> <b>owner</b> is a specific role, our results indicate that, in general, missing or ambiguously specified roles and responsibilities are extremely important for routine processes and very important for nonroutine processes. We think that this is reasonable as the pace and precision of routine processes require clearly defined and specialized roles, whereas the unpredictability of nonroutine processes calls for more flexible job profiles. Finally, the reason that stakeholders have unrealistic expectations regarding process performance is important for routine processes and very important for nonroutine processes. This difference is backed by the modi, but not by the test statistics such that we cannot take it as fully valid. However, we think it is reasonable as the outcome of nonroutine processes is not clearly specified when starting a process and may be subject to substantial change during process execution. Thus, it is much more likely that process stakeholders have unrealistic expectations.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – With {{increasing}} choice from a {{range of}} programs, improvement project selection within broader supply chain context and resource constraints has become a major research challenge. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the different criteria for selecting Six-Sigma (SS) projects based on previous studies. The study is supported by two grounded theories: resource-based view and institutional norms. The criteria include: first, business drivers for improvement and the common performance metrics deployed; second, the organization’s stakeholders needs; and third, <b>process</b> <b>owner’s</b> needs. Design/methodology/approach – To determine the relative importance of influencing factors, opinions were collected from 30 experienced practitioners including SS champions/master black-belts, company directors, consultants, and <b>process</b> <b>owners</b> through a series of interviews in small, medium, and large organizations including multi-national organizations. The evaluation of criteria is based on analytical hierarchy process. Findings – The results show that impact on customer, financial impacts, and impact on operational goals are the most significant factors in selecting SS improvement project. Originality/value – This study is a first attempt to determine the relative weight among SS project selection criteria, which help the practitioner to allocate their limited resources in implementing SS project...|$|R
