5|$|The 2002 San Francisco Bowl {{kicked off}} on December 31, 2002 at <b>Pacific</b> <b>Bell</b> Park in San Francisco, California. The weather {{was clear and}} unseasonably warm for San Francisco in late December, but the field was soggy after several days of rain. In the first seven minutes of the game, Air Force scored 10consecutive points to take an early 10–0 lead. The Tech defense {{eventually}} clamped down on the Falcons' offense, however, and only allowed three points {{for the remainder of}} the game. The Virginia Tech offense slowly climbed back from the initial 10-point deficit, scoring a touchdown in the first quarter and a field goal in the second. By halftime, the Hokies had equalized the score at 10–10.|$|E
5|$|Two subway stations, West Portal Station and Forest Hill Station, {{and five}} of the six light-rail lines, J Church, K Ingleside, L Taraval, M Ocean View, and N Judah, are {{remnants}} of an extensive streetcar system that survived the mass conversion to buses in the 1950s. In 1980, seven subway stations, from Embarcadero Station to Castro Street Station, were opened with the inauguration of the Market Street Subway underneath Market Street, marking the conversion of San Francisco's streetcar system into the Muni Metro. In 1998, four surface stations on The Embarcadero opened, connecting the newly constructed AT Park (then called <b>Pacific</b> <b>Bell</b> Park) and Caltrain to Muni Metro. In 2007, the T Third Street line was started along 18 new surface stations built along new track laid from Caltrain down {{the eastern side of the}} city to the city line.|$|E

25|$|AT Park is a {{baseball}} park {{located in the}} South Beach neighborhood of San Francisco, California.

50|$|<b>Pacific</b> Northwest <b>Bell</b> Telephone Company was an AT&T majority-owned Bell System {{company that}} {{provided}} local telecommunications services in Oregon, Washington, and northern Idaho. <b>Pacific</b> Northwest <b>Bell</b> Telephone Company was formed on July 1, 1961 {{when it was}} spun off from the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company. On January 1, 1984, <b>Pacific</b> Northwest <b>Bell</b> was split from AT&T as ordered in the settlement of United States v. AT&T and became {{a subsidiary of the}} newly formed Regional Bell Operating Company U S WEST, Inc. <b>Pacific</b> Northwest <b>Bell</b> became defunct when U S WEST consolidated its three main subsidiaries, forming U S WEST Communications, Inc. on January 1, 1991. U S WEST merged with Qwest Communications International Inc. in 2000, and the US WEST brand was replaced by the Qwest brand. Qwest Communications merged with Louisiana-based CenturyLink in 2011, and the Qwest brand was replaced by the CenturyLink brand.|$|R
25|$|Like {{most other}} Bay Area cities, USPS, UPS, FedEx, and DHL are readily {{available}} to Milpitas.

ZIP code 95035 is exclusively for Milpitas and is the only standard ZIP code for the city. 95036 is a new ZIP that is used sometimes for post office boxes in Milpitas. Until the merge with SBC, Milpitas had relied on <b>Pacific</b> <b>Bell</b> for its telecommunications services. American Telegraph and Telephone (AT) acquired Southern Bell (SBC) in 2006 and became the land-line telephone provider in the city. As part of the agreement for the merger of AT with SBC, Milpitas residents were offered high speed DSL internet access with AT for only $10 per month until December 2009, although few residents were aware of the offer.|$|E
500|$|The {{tour was}} {{announced}} on 13 February 1992, {{a little more}} than two weeks before opening night on 29 February at Lakeland Civic Center in Lakeland, Florida. For the opening leg, 32 concerts at indoor arenas in North America were scheduled from February through April. Two days after the tour announcement, tickets for some of the shows first went on sale. While the band had toured North America every year between 1980 and 1987, they had been absent from the region's tour circuit for over four years before Zoo TV. The US concert business was in a slump at the time, and the routing of the first two legs generally allowed only one show per city. This was intended to announce the band's return to major cities, to gauge demand for ticket sales, and to re-introduce the notion of a [...] "hot ticket" [...] to concertgoers. Tickets for the opening show in Florida sold out over the phone in four minutes, demand exceeding supply by a factor of 10 to 1. To combat ticket scalping, the band avoided selling tickets in box offices as much as possible, preferring to sell over the telephone instead. Several cities' telephone systems were overwhelmed when Zoo TV tickets went on sale; Los Angeles telephone company <b>Pacific</b> <b>Bell</b> reported 54million calls in a four-hour period, while Boston's telephone system was temporarily shut down.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the oldest}} engineers, Wally was {{originally}} a worker trying to get fired to get a severance package. He hates work and avoids it whenever he can. He often carries a cup of coffee, calmly sipping from it {{even in the midst}} of chaos or office-shaking revelations. Wally is extremely cynical. He is even more socially inept than Dilbert (though far less self-aware of the fact), and references to his lack of personal hygiene are not uncommon. Like the Pointy-Haired Boss, Wally is utterly lacking in ethics and will take advantage of any situation to maximize his personal gain while doing the least possible amount of honest work. Squat and balding, Wally is almost invariably portrayed wearing a short sleeved dress shirt and tie. [...] Adams has stated that Wally was based on a <b>Pacific</b> <b>Bell</b> coworker of his who was interested in a generous employee buy-out program—for the company's worst employees. This had the effect of causing this man—whom Adams describes as [...] "one of the more brilliant people I've met"—to work hard at being incompetent, rude, and generally poor at his job to qualify for the buy-out program. Adams has said that this inspired the basic laziness and amorality of Wally's character. Despite these personality traits Wally is accepted as part of Dilbert, Ted, Alice, and Asok's clique. Although his relationship with Alice is often antagonistic and Dilbert occasionally denies being his friend, their actions show at least a certain acceptance of him.|$|E

2500|$|Aside from {{terms in}} oral or written agreements, terms can be {{incorporated}} by reference. Two main sources are collective agreements and company handbooks. In JI Case Co v National Labor Relations Board an employing corporation argued {{it should not have}} to bargain in good faith with a labor union, and did not commit an unfair labor practice by refusing, because it had recently signed individual contracts with its employees. The US Supreme Court held unanimously that the [...] "very purpose" [...] of collective bargaining and the National Labor Relations Act 1935 was [...] "to supersede the terms of separate agreements of employees with terms which reflect the strength and bargaining power and serve the welfare of the group". Terms of collective agreements, to the advantage of individual employees, therefore supersede individual contracts. Similarly, if a written contract states that employees do not have rights, but an employee has been told they do by a supervisor, or rights are assured in a company handbook, they will usually have a claim. For example, in Torosyan v Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc the Supreme Court of Connecticut held that a promise in a handbook that an employee could be dismissed only for a good reason (or [...] "just cause") was binding on the employing corporation. Furthermore, an employer had no right to unilaterally change the terms. Most other state courts have reached the same conclusion, that contracts cannot be altered, except for employees' benefit, without new consideration and true agreement. By contrast, a slight majority on the California Supreme Court, appointed by Republican governors, held in Asmus v <b>Pacific</b> <b>Bell</b> that a company policy of indefinite duration can be altered after a reasonable time with reasonable notice, if it affects no vested benefits. The four dissenting judges, appointed by Democratic governors, held this was a [...] "patently unfair, indeed unconscionable, result – permitting an employer that made a promise of continuing job security... to repudiate that promise with impunity several years later". In addition, a basic term of good faith which cannot be waived, is implied by common law or equity in all states. This usually demands, as a general principle that [...] "neither party shall do anything, which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party, to receive the fruits of the contract". The term of good faith persists throughout the employment relationship. It has not yet been used extensively by state courts, compared to other jurisdictions. The Montana Supreme Court has recognized that extensive and even punitive damages could be available for breach of an employee's reasonable expectations. However others, such as the California Supreme Court limit any recovery of damages to contract breaches, but not damages regarding the manner of termination. By contrast, in the United Kingdom the requirement for [...] "good faith" [...] has been found to limit the power of discharge except for fair reasons (but not to conflict with statute), in Canada it may limit unjust discharge also for self-employed persons, and in Germany it can preclude the payment of wages significantly below average.|$|E
