5|$|In 1906, Cuba was in {{the midst}} of a {{constitutional}} crisis as a result of a disputed election and an attempt by elected President Tomás Estrada Palma to stay in power after the conclusion of his term. This led to a revolt, and the U.S. military sent in 5,600 men to reassert control over the country in what would be called the Second Occupation of Cuba. This was permitted under the Cuban-American Treaty of Relations of 1903, a treaty that stipulated the degree of United States intervention in Cuba. After a brief <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stabilization</b> by Secretary Taft, Magoon was appointed governor under the Constitution of Cuba, effectively with absolute authority and backed by the U.S. military.|$|E
50|$|Coming off {{long-term}} lorazepam use {{may be more}} realistically {{achieved by}} a gradual switch to an equivalent dose of diazepam and a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stabilization</b> on this, and only then initiating dose reductions. The advantage of switching to diazepam is that dose reductions are felt less acutely, because of the longer half-lives (20-200 hours) of diazepam and its active metabolites.|$|E

40|$|Ground {{penetrating}} radar (GPR) profiles {{across a}} complex linear dune in the Namib Sand Sea {{have been used}} to image sets of cross-stratification and their bounding surfaces. A combination of radar facies analysis and radar stratigraphy has been used to interpret the radar profiles and define a relative chronology. Thick sets of cross-stratification indicate when the dune was most active, whereas thin sets of cross-stratification are interpreted to indicate the increased prevalence of wind reversals and lower rates of dune migration, with bounding surfaces formed during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>stabilization,</b> non-deposition or erosion. A drilling and dating campaign was designed {{on the basis of the}} dune stratigraphy as defined by the GPR survey Sampling was targeted at large sets of cross-stratification formed when the dunes were most active, and avoiding bounding surfaces formed when the dune was stable or even eroded. The results from optical dating give ages between 0. 34 +/- 0. 02 ka and 1. 57 +/- 0. 07 ka, indicating a time-averaged dune migration rate of 0. 12 m a(- 1) over the past 1600 years.

50|$|Given {{that average}} yearly {{temperatures}} are currently increasing, and {{the outlook is}} for this trend to continue, it is actually possible that the glacier might experience a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stabilization</b> or slight advance during its retreating march. This is because increasing amounts of warm, moist air will be carried up {{to the head of}} the icefield, where colder ambient temperatures will cause it to precipitate as snow. The increased amount of snow will feed the icefield, possibly enough to offset the continually increasing melting experienced at the glacier's terminus. However, this interesting phenomenon will fade away if temperatures continue to climb, since the head of the glacier will no longer have cold enough ambient temperatures to cause snow to precipitate.|$|E

40|$|The {{transient}} response of global-mean precipitation {{to an increase}} in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels of 1 % yr(- 1) is investigated in 13 fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) and compared to a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stabilization.</b> During the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stabilization,</b> when carbon dioxide levels are held constant at twice their unperturbed level and the climate left to warm, precipitation increases at a rate of similar to 2. 4 % per unit of global-mean surface-air-temperature change in the AOGCMs. However, when carbon dioxide levels are increasing, precipitation increases at a smaller rate of similar to 1. 5 % per unit of global-mean surface-air-temperature change. This difference can be understood by decomposing the precipitation response into an increase from the response to the global surface-temperature increase (and the climate feedbacks it induces), and a fast atmospheric response to the carbon dioxide radiative forcing that acts to decrease precipitation. According to the multi-model mean, stabilizing atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide would lead to a greater rate of precipitation change per unit of global surface-temperature change...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} was to study the effects of rapid maxil-lary expansion on the pressures exerted by the cheeks on the maxillary arch. The sample consisted of 15 patients (five males, ten females) who received either a Hyrax or Haas type expansion appliance for treatment of a bilateral maxillary constriction of more than 5 mm. The median age of the sample was 12 years. Buccal pressures were measured at the upper first molar on the left and right side, before and after active expansion, and also after an average of 3 - 4 months of retention with the appliance in place. Buccal pressures on the maxillary first molar averaged approximately 3 g/cm 2 before expansion and increased significantly to a value of approximately 9 g/cm 2 after expansion. Pressure change was approximately 0. 6 g/cm 2 for each millimetre of expansion. During the 3 - 4 -month <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stabilization</b> of the appliance, the pressures remained at the post-expansion levels and no adaptation of the soft tissues was observed. These results lead to the conclusion that cheek pressures on the maxillary arch may be implicated in the relapse occurring after rapid expansion, even after the usual 3 -month <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stabilization...</b>|$|E

[...] The Politburo saw the policy <b>of</b> <b>stabilization</b> as the only way to avoid returning to Joseph Stalin's purges and Khrushchev's re-organization of Party-Government institutions.

The Soviet leadership was not entirely opposed to reform, even if the reform movement had been weakened {{in the aftermath of the}} Prague Spring in the Czechoslovakia. The result was a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> overt <b>stabilization</b> at the heart of government, a policy which also had the effect of reducing cultural freedom: several dissident samizdats were shut down.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} continual spike-timing {{dependent}} plasticity (STDP) on the topology of evolving neural networks were assessed. After a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stabilization,</b> {{a number of}} topological features were monitored periodically throughout simulations of network activity to quantify changes in network structure. Under a range of different input regimes and initial network configurations, each network maintained a robust and highly stable global structure.

These findings suggest that on-going STDP provides an efficient means of selecting and maintaining a stable yet flexible network organization. PsychologyDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

On arrival to the Accident and Emergency Department, the patient was tachycardic, hypotensive, hypoxic, and acidotic with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 3. Despite initial interventions, the patient remained persistently hypotensive. An echocardiogram demonstrated a traumatic ventricular septal defect (VSD) with right ventricular strain and increased pulmonary artery pressure. Following a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stabilization,</b> open cardiothoracic surgery was performed and revealed an aneurysmal septum with a single large defect. This was repaired with a bovine patch, resulting in normalization of right ventricular function. This case provides a vivid depiction of a large VSD in a patient following blunt chest trauma with hemodynamic compromise. In all thoracic trauma patients, and particularly those poorly responsive to resuscitation, VSDs should be considered. Relevant investigations and management strategies are discussed...|$|E

The government also issued new securities to provide a source of credit for the banks and began enlisting the help of various cartels (consorzi) that had been created by Italian business leaders since 1922. The government offered recognition and support to these organizations in exchange for promises that they would manipulate prices in accordance with government priorities.|$|R
