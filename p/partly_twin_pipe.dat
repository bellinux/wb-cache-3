40|$|AbstractIn Sweden, around 10 % of {{the energy}} {{supplied}} to the district heating networks are lost through heat losses from the distribution pipes. In cylindrical geometries it is preferable to improve the insulation {{as close to the}} center as possible. This has resulted in a hybrid insulation district heating pipe concept with a combination of vacuum insulation panels at the center, held in place by polyurethane foam. In the <b>twin</b> <b>pipe</b> concept, the vacuum insulation panel cover the supply pipe. This creates a complex temperature profile over the section and measured results on single pipes might not be applicable. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} a method to evaluate the improvement of hybrid insulation <b>twin</b> <b>pipes</b> in the laboratory. This paper presents a method where two guarded hot pipe apparatuses is used, one heating rod for each pipe, to measure the heat losses from hybrid pipes and compare to a conventional polyurethane pipe.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{life-cycle}} environmental impacts from an EPSPEX system for distribution of district heat (a four-pipe system with centrally generated hot tap water) are {{compared with the}} environmental impacts of a twin-pipe system with steel media pipes, if installed in the same area. A life cycle assessment of the EPSPEX system constructed in Vråen, Värnamo, Sweden, has been reported in Miljöbelastning från EPSPEX-systemet. Del 1 : Livscykelanalys av polystyrenisolerat fjärrvärmesystem med PEX-mediarör [1]. In that study the question was raised of how the EPSPEX system compares with a conventional twin-pipe system with polyurethane-insulated steel media pipes. In the present study the EPSPEX system in Vråen is compared with a hypothetical construction of a conventional <b>twin</b> <b>pipe</b> system in the same area. Two different fuel mixes for district heat generation have been studied to increase the understanding of the environmental performance of district heat distribution systems; the fuel mix used in Vråen (heat delivered from Värnamo Energi) and Swedish average district heat. How media pipes from the two different materials (PEX and steel) compare is discussed in a separate part. There are technical differences that must be kept in mind when the systems are compared in this way. The EPSPEX system is designed for low-pressure district heat systems and could only be used in such context. It is unadvisable to install the EPSPEX system below the ground water table; this is not a restriction for the <b>twin</b> <b>pipe</b> system. Under the conditions of this study the environmental performance of the EPSPEX system is better than the <b>twin</b> <b>pipe</b> system. The heat loss from the EPSPEX system is approximately 60 % of the heat loss for a comparable <b>twin</b> <b>pipe</b> system. This is caused by a combination of thick insulation for the EPSPEX system and the possibility to summertime shut down the district heating circuit for this system and only use the hot tap-water circuit. Note, however, that the heat loss from the EPSPEX system is more uncertain compared to the twin-pipe system. From the characterization methods used, the production of the EPSPEX system gives a higher environmental impact compared to the <b>twin</b> <b>pipe</b> system. This heavily depends on the large amount of insulating material used. However, the environmental impacts from production of the insulation are more then outweighed by the emissions avoided from heat generation due to lower heat loss. District heating sub centrals generates a notable part of the total environmental impact when using the weighing method EPS 2000. Note that sub centrals are not technically necessary in low-pressure district heat systems, as the EPSPEX system. The comparison between different fuel mixes for heat generation indicates clearly that the heat generation is an important parameter for environmental performance for all district heating. It is further indicated that also biofuels must be used with sensible and environmentally friendly methods. The media pipes of PEX seem to give lower environmental impacts compared with media pipes of steel. However, the results differ between assessment methods used...|$|R

The resulting model is carefully examined in a parameter study, from which a number of interesting conclusions can be drawn. Firstly, the heat losses {{are found to be}} nearly independent of the mass flow rate in the range of mass flow rates usually encountered in thermal network pipes. The remaining heat loss calculation is simply based on temperature levels and thermal resistance factors, determined by the pipe dimensions and materials. Furthermore, it is found that heat losses from supply to return side should be incorporated in the analysis for better accuracy of the results, even more so with the increasing popularity of <b>twin</b> <b>pipes</b> with common insulation. status: publishe...|$|R

X-ray diffractometry of Pt-Fe crystals suggests a F-centred cubic lattice, characteristic of ferroan platinum.

40|$|In nano-porous thermal {{insulation}} {{there is a}} strong relation between the pressure and the thermal conductivity, even at pressures close to atmospheric pressure. This thesis presents research on applications of nano-porous insulation in hybrid insulation district heating pipes and in building walls. A concept of hybrid insulation district heating pipes has been investigated where the innermost layers of insulation consists of nano-porous insulation and the outer layers consists of polyurethane foam insulation. The concept has been investigated through a mix of laboratory measurements, field measurements and simulations. The presented research indicates that vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) can be used in district heating pipes to reduce the heat losses. For the evaluated configurations the heat losses were reduced by a magnitude of 30 %. The heat losses from the supply <b>pipe</b> in a <b>twin</b> <b>pipe</b> were reduced by 50 %. The two main considerations with using vacuum panels in district heating pipes are the thermal bridges and the long term performance. It is shown that the position of the thermal bridges in the panels has a large effect on the thermal performance of the <b>twin</b> <b>pipes</b> and the results indicate a preferred configuration to minimize heat loss. The thesis presents a model to evaluate the long term performance of the VIPs through temperature measurements. After three years of field measurements on pipes connected to a district heating network with temperatures up to 90 C, {{there is no sign of}} any uncontrolled deterioration of the VIPs. Results from the investigation show that the use of aerogel can reduce the thickness of a load bearing stud wall with 40 % compared to the use of conventional insulation. If done wrong, this can lead to some new consideration regarding mold growth risk. The fact that the thermal conductivity of nano-porous insulation is strongly influenced by the pressure in the pore gas can be used to create variable insulation, where the thermal properties of the insulation is changed to match the current circumstances. By putting the insulation in a diffusion tight bag, connected to a vacuum pump, the pressure in the material can be changed and thereby the thermal conductivity. The pressure was varied in a fumed silica and an aerogel blanket sample between 1 kPa and atmospheric pressure, which gave a variation in the thermal conductivity of 1. 5 for the aerogel blanket and 3 for the fumed silica. Transient measurements during evacuation and refilling show that the thermal performance will be influenced by some transient effects, such as influence from the temperature of the inserted air, but the time scale is too small to have any large effect on the energy performance. When the variation is used in simulations of the energy use for an office building, an interesting result is that a variable construction gave a higher optimum U-value, corresponding to thinner walls...|$|R

However, its performance is adversely affected by point defects, structural and compositional heterogeneities within the crystals, such as <b>twinning,</b> <b>pipes,</b> grain boundaries (polycrystallinity), secondary phases and in some cases, damage caused by external forces. One example is damage that occurs during characterization of the surface by a laser during Raman spectroscopy. Even minimal laser power can cause Te enriched areas on the surface to appear. The Raman spectra resulting from measurements at moderate intensity laser power show large increases in peak intensity that is attributed to Te. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was used to characterize the extent of damage to the CZT crystal surface following exposure to the Raman laser. AFM data reveal localized surface damage in the areas exposed to the Raman laser beam. The degree of surface damage to the crystal is dependent on the laser power, with the most observable damage occurring at high laser power. Moreover, intensity increases in the Te peaks of the Raman spectra are observed even at low laser power with little to no visible damage observed by AFM. AFM results also suggest that exposure to the same amount of laser power yields different amounts of surface damage depending on whether the exposed surface is the Te terminating face or the Cd terminating face of CZT...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the studies}} that {{comprise}} this thesis was to predict the heat loss over time {{from a range of}} district heating pipes insulated with closed-cells foam. The thermal conductivity of the foam changes over time when it is not diffusion-tight encapsulated against the environment, as diffusion alters the cell gas composition until it reaches equilibrium with the surrounding air. Over the first thirty years of use the insulation capacity of a straight pipe of medium size insulated with polyurethane foam decreases by about 10 %. The insulating gases cyclopentane and carbon dioxide initially present in the foam cells diffuse out of the foam over time, while nitrogen and oxygen from the air diffuse into it. Complete ageing increases the thermal conductivity of the insulation by about 10 mW·m- 1 ·K- 1, but it is a slow process that takes several years. Equilibrium is not even reached after 100 years. In this work models have been derived {{that can be used to}} predict the long-term heat flow from the pipes and investigate the influence of factors that have an impact. Finite difference models for the pipes alone are presented, which consider the variation of the cell gas composition over the foam cross section. All gases are considered in the gas phase. But cyclopentane is also considered in dissolved state, as well as potentially in liquid state depending on the amount and the temperature present. In order to determine the solubility of cyclopentane in the polyurethane matrix of the foam measurements were performed. The solubility was found to decrease with temperature. About 50 % of the cyclopentane was dissolved at room temperature, while only about 35 % was dissolved at 50 ᵒC. There is a weak coupling between the heat conduction (i. e. temperature) and the gas diffusion (i. e. cell gas content) due to the fact that the thermal conductivity is dependent both on the temperature and the cell gas content, which has been taken into consideration. Both single and <b>twin</b> <b>pipe</b> geometry have been studied. Complex mathematics in the form of a coordinate transformation is needed to perform the predictions for <b>twin</b> <b>pipe</b> geometry. To model installed pipes, a stationary model for annularly insulated pipes in the ground has been developed, which also involves complicated mathematics. The temperature is represented by series expansions; in each region with differing thermal conductivity a separate expansion is used. The expansions are matched to each other at the region boundaries and chosen to fulfil the boundary conditions. Finally, the measured cell gas status of aged pipes and the results obtained by modelling based on assumptions of their initial status and ageing conditions have been compared. It was found that the actual aged pipes contained less oxygen and more carbon dioxide than predicted. This is probably due to oxidation. It is interesting to note that not only the oxygen but also the carbon dioxide content is influenced by oxidation. By consuming oxygen and producing carbon dioxide the oxidation will slow down the decrease of the insulation performance...|$|R
