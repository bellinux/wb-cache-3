30|$|I interviewed 20 {{people out}} of which we had 16 men who included: pastoralists, butchers, {{livestock}} buyers, veterinary officers, green offal cleaners, splitters, skinners, and those who slaughter the livestock <b>at</b> the <b>slaughterhouse.</b> I also managed to interview 4 women <b>at</b> the <b>slaughterhouse</b> among them were 2 veterinary officers, a single pastoralist woman and one butcher. The proportion of women was less because of their low rate of engagement in slaughterhouse operations as {{compared to that of}} men. This study collected qualitative data only and relied on convenient sampling in selecting informants. Literature on the actors and their roles, and the institutional settings and changes <b>at</b> the <b>slaughterhouse</b> was reviewed. Interviews using key informant interview guides were conducted with pastoralists, livestock buyers, butchers, veterinary officers and flayers as key stakeholders <b>at</b> the <b>slaughterhouse.</b> This elicited information on the specific objectives, establishing actors and their roles in pastoralism <b>at</b> the <b>slaughterhouse</b> and describing the institutional settings and changes in pastoralism. Another data collecting method used <b>at</b> the <b>slaughterhouse</b> was unstructured observations, to give insights into the design and the terrain of the slaughterhouse and the level of physical interactions eliciting economic and social relationships among actors and their roles.|$|R
