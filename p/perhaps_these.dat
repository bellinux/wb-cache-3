25|$|The Phoenicians {{introduced}} sheep from Asia Minor into North Africa and {{the foundation}} flocks of the merino in Spain {{might have been}} introduced {{as late as the}} 12th century by the Marinids, a tribe of Berbers. although there were reports of the breed in the Iberian peninsula before the arrival of the Marinids; <b>perhaps</b> <b>these</b> came from the Merinos or tax collectors of the Kingdom of León, who charged the tenth in wool, beef jerky and cheese. In the 13th and 14th centuries, Spanish breeders introduced English breeds which they bred with local breeds to develop the merino; this influence was openly documented by Spanish writers at the time.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian asked six {{well-known}} {{film critics}} {{for their own}} perceptions of the overall meaning in Mulholland Drive. Neil Roberts of The Sun and Tom Charity of Time Out subscribe to the theory that Betty is Diane's projection of a happier life. Roger Ebert and Jonathan Ross seem to accept this interpretation, but both hesitate to overanalyze the film. Ebert states, [...] "There is no explanation. There {{may not even be}} a mystery." [...] Ross observes that there are storylines that go nowhere: [...] "Perhaps these were leftovers from the pilot it was originally intended to be, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>these</b> things are the non-sequiturs and subconscious of dreams." [...] Philip French from The Observer sees it as an allusion to Hollywood tragedy, while Jane Douglas from the BBC rejects the theory of Betty's life as Diane's dream, but also warns against too much analysis.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{investigations}} of crystalline physics, Friedemann Freund found that water molecules embedded in rock can dissociate into ions if the rock is under intense stress.

Freund suggested that <b>perhaps</b> <b>these</b> currents could {{be responsible for}} earthquake precursors such as electromagnetic radiation, earthquake lights and disturbances of the plasma in the ionosphere. The study of such currents and interactions is known as [...] "Freund physics".|$|E
2500|$|Several {{other authors}} have {{followed}} McLeod in speculating about parallels between Japanese and Israelite rituals, culture and language {{in an attempt}} to support the hypothesis. Arimasa Kubo, an ordained Christian minister, has translated McLeod's book into Japanese, and has published a number of works on the topic. In his article, [...] "Mystery of the Ten Lost Tribes: Japan," [...] he asserts that many traditional customs and ceremonies in Japan are very similar to those of ancient Israel. He postulates that <b>perhaps</b> <b>these</b> rituals came from the Jews through members of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, who might have come to ancient Japan.|$|E

[...] The comparison is overt, as the victim's name in the film is also Elenor. Later, Sam recalls Elenor's friend in a mental institution, alluding to the crazy Pip in Moby-Dick and back to Cassius the [...] "psychopath": <b>perhaps</b> <b>these</b> are crazy characters who speak the truth.

2500|$|Hereafter, {{there is}} a gap of about twenty one months (January 1709 - October 1710) in our {{information}} of Churaman’s movements. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>these</b> days he was silently busy in expanding and consolidating his hold. Sometime in October 1710 possibly on being summoned he presented himself to Bahadur Shah (ca. October 1710) somewhere near Delhi, when the Emperor was on his march against Banda. He was placed under Muhammad Amin Khan, who had been ordered to capture Sarhind. Subsequently, serving the Wazir faithfully, he {{took part in the}} campaigns at Sandhaura and Lohagarh., The Wazir, who had shown his favours, died in February 1711; and this exposed him to the pressures of the Court. We learn form the Akhabarat that the fortress at Halena being built by his brother, Ati Ram, would be demolished [...] It is not clear whether or not this was carried out, Churaman, however, moved on with the Emperor to Lahore.|$|E

2500|$|In 2017, Nature {{published}} an editorial entitled [...] "Removing Statues of Historical figures risks whitewashing history: Science must acknowledge mistakes as it marks its past". The article {{commented on the}} placement and maintenance of statues honouring scientists with known unethical, abusive and torturous histories. Specifically, the editorial called on examples of J. Marion Sims, the 'Father of gynecology' who experimented on African American women (slaves) without their consent, and Thomas Parran Jr. who oversaw the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. [...] The editorial as written {{made the case that}} removing such statues, and erasing names, runs the risk of [...] "whitewashing history", and stated “Instead of removing painful reminders, <b>perhaps</b> <b>these</b> should be supplemented”. The article caused a large outcry and was quickly modified by Nature. The article was largely seen as offensive, inappropriate, and by many, racist. Nature acknowledged that the article as originally written was [...] "offensive and poorly worded" [...] and published selected letters of response. The editorial came just weeks after hundreds of white supremacists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia in the Unite the Right rally to oppose the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, setting off violence in the streets and killing a young woman. When Nature posted a link to the editorial on Twitter, the thread quickly exploded with criticisms. In response, several scientists called for a boycott. On 18 September 2017, the editorial was updated and edited by Philip Campbell, the editor of the journal.|$|E
