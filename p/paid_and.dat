5|$|Feminist economists {{join the}} UN {{and others in}} {{acknowledging}} care work, {{as a kind of}} work which includes all tasks involving caregiving, as central to economic development and human well-being. Feminist economists study both <b>paid</b> <b>and</b> unpaid care work. They argue that traditional analysis of economics often ignores the value of household unpaid work. Feminist economists have argued that unpaid domestic work is as valuable as paid work, so measures of economic success should include unpaid work. They have shown that women are disproportionately responsible for performing such care work.|$|E
40|$|In many {{contemporary}} families, both parents {{are involved in}} <b>paid</b> work <b>and</b> family responsibilities. This creates challenges for the successful reconciliation of work and family. In this study, we examined whether and how the division of <b>paid</b> work <b>and</b> unpaid work between partners is related to work–family interference. Analyses were based on survey data of 147 Finnish, 186 German, and 265 Dutch dual-earner couples with young children and {{show that there is}} no recipe for a division of <b>paid</b> work <b>and</b> unpaid work that guarantees a conflict-free reconciliation of work and family. Although some cultural variation was identified, in general, individual time spent on <b>paid</b> work <b>and</b> unpaid work appeared to be more decisive for parents’ level of work–family interference than couples’ combination strategies. Therefore, to help working parents it seems important to create opportunities to adjust their time spent on <b>paid</b> work <b>and</b> unpaid work. <br/...|$|R

5|$|In early 346 BC, Philip let it {{be known}} that he {{intended}} to march south with the Thessalians, though not where or why. The Phocians thus made plans to defend Thermopylae, and requested assistance from the Spartans and the Athenians, probably around the 14th of February. The Spartans dispatched Archidamos III with 1000 hoplites, and the Athenians ordered everyone eligible for military service under the age of 40 to be sent to the Phocians' aid. However, between the Phocians' appeal and the end of the month, all plans were upset by the return of Phalaikos to power in Phocis; the Athenians and the Spartans were subsequently told that they would not be permitted to defend Thermopylae. It is not clear from the ancient sources why Phalaikos was returned to power, nor why he adopted this dramatic change of policy. Cawkwell suggests, based on remarks of Aeschines that the Phocian army restored Phalaikos because they had not been properly <b>paid,</b> <b>and</b> further that Phalaikos, realizing that the army could not be <b>paid</b> <b>and</b> that the Phocians could no longer hope to win the war, decided to try to negotiate a peace settlement with Philip.|$|E

40|$|<b>Paid</b> family <b>and</b> {{medical leave}} helps workers manage {{their work and}} family {{responsibilities}} {{by allowing them to}} take extended time away from work while receiving some wage replacement and without the threat of being fired. Although New Hampshire currently does not have a <b>paid</b> family <b>and</b> medical leave law or program, these policies are gaining momentum across the United States. In this brief, author Kristin Smith discusses the results of a winter 2016 Granite State Poll in which New Hampshire residents were asked if they would support or oppose a <b>paid</b> family <b>and</b> medical leave law in New Hampshire providing paid leave from work for personal or family reasons. Eighty-two percent of New Hampshire residents, including nearly nine in ten women and three in four men, said they support <b>paid</b> family <b>and</b> medical leave insurance. All groups of men support <b>paid</b> family <b>and</b> medical leave, but men who are married, employed, have higher education levels, or live in higher-income families are the least supportive relative to comparable women. Among employed respondents, 69 percent said {{they would be willing to}} pay $ 5 per week into a <b>paid</b> family <b>and</b> medical leave insurance program...|$|R
5|$|Longchamp went to {{the court}} of Henry VI, the Holy Roman Emperor, who was holding King Richard captive at Trifels.

When the Emperor in January 1194 called a meeting of the imperial magnates to debate King Philip II of France's offer to pay the Emperor to keep Richard captive, Longchamp attended along with Walter of Coutances and Eleanor of Aquitaine, Richard's mother. After further diplomatic wrangling, Richard was freed on 4 February 1194.|$|E
5|$|On 14 March 1772, amid various {{political}} machinations, Count Hieronymus von Colloredo {{was elected to}} the archbishopric as a compromise candidate acceptable to the imperial court in Vienna. Although unpopular among Salzburgers, this appointment appeared at first to be to the Mozarts' advantage: Leopold's withheld salary was <b>paid,</b> <b>and</b> on 31 August Colloredo authorised the payment of Wolfgang's Konzertmeister salary. However, the new archbishop began to look for someone outside the Salzburg court to be his new Kapellmeister. Eventually, he chose the Italian Domenico Fischietti, who was several years younger than Leopold. Realising that his chances of promotion had probably been irrevocably lost, Leopold turned his hopes for a comfortable old age towards Wolfgang, giving new urgency to the third Italian journey which began in October 1772.|$|E

40|$|This {{literature}} review highlights the main findings in current research looking at <b>paid</b> family <b>and</b> medical leave policies, and then examines how these experiences can inform {{the development of}} a paid leave policy in the District of Colombia. The need for <b>paid</b> family <b>and</b> medical leave is high, <b>and</b> <b>paid</b> leave would benefit nearly all employees {{at some point in their}} working lives. One in every five adults has taken family leave in the past three years. Support for these programs is generally very favorable among both employees and employers as well. The most common problem with current paid leave programs is a lack of awareness or ability to use the benefit. Any <b>paid</b> family <b>and</b> medical leave policy implementation must be accompanied with some sort of education campaign whether it is directed at workers or done through employer buy-in. There are many lessons to learn from existing <b>paid</b> family <b>and</b> medical leave programs, but ultimately the current programs are still very successful...|$|R
5|$|Stone keep {{construction}} required skilled craftsmen.

They were also relatively slow to erect, due to {{the limitations of the}} lime mortar used during the period – a keep's walls could usually be raised by a maximum of only 12 feet (3.6 metres) a year; the keep at Scarborough was not atypical in taking ten years to build. The number of such keeps remained relatively low: in England, for example, although several early stone keeps had been built after the conquest, there were only somewhere between ten and fifteen in existence by 1100, and only around a hundred had been built by 1216.|$|E

The cemetery contains a number of German regimental memorials within the cemetery which were <b>paid</b> <b>and</b> provided by the city or town where the regiment was based.|$|E

40|$|The present thesis {{focuses on}} causes <b>and</b> {{consequences}} of <b>paid</b> working hours <b>and</b> housework hours among {{women and men}} in Sweden and Europe. It consists of four studies. Study I investigates changes in the division of housework in Swedish couples when they become parents. The study shows that women adjust their housework hours to the number and age of children in the household, whereas men do not. Longer parental leave periods among fathers have the potential to counteract this change towards a more traditional division of housework. Study II explores the associations between psychological distress <b>and</b> <b>paid</b> working hours, housework hours and total role time in Sweden. The results suggest that women’s psychological distress decreases with increasing <b>paid</b> working hours <b>and</b> housework hours, but that a long total role time is associated with high levels of distress. The gender difference in time spent on housework accounts for 40 per cent of the gender difference in psychological distress. Study III asks whether hours spent on <b>paid</b> work <b>and</b> housework account for the European gender difference in well-being, and whether the associations between well-being <b>and</b> hours of <b>paid</b> work <b>and</b> housework is influenced by gender attitudes and social comparison. The results indicate that gender differences in time spent on <b>paid</b> work <b>and</b> housework account for a third of the gender difference in well-being. Gender attitudes and social comparison do not to any great extent influence the associations between well-being <b>and</b> <b>paid</b> work <b>and</b> housework, respectively. Study IV examines possible differences between European family policy models in the associations between well-being <b>and</b> hours of <b>paid</b> work <b>and</b> housework. Some model differences are found, and they are accounted for by experiences of work-family conflict among men, but not among women. For both women and men, work-family conflict appears to suppress positive aspects of paid working hours...|$|R
