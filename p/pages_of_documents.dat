They also recovered 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on Manning's MacBook hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Julian Assange. Two of the chat handles, which used the Berlin Chaos Computer Club's domain (ccc.de), were associated with the names Julian Assange and Nathaniel Frank.|$|E

25|$|Before the book's publication, the Reagan {{administration}} {{claimed that}} unclassified source documents were released to Bamford in error, and threatened him with prosecution {{if he did}} not return 250 <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> he had obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. The documents in question related to a 1975-76 Department of Justice investigation, and described the NSA's widespread illegal monitoring of domestic communication, warrantless surveillance of Americans, and monitoring of commercial cable and telex traffic. Bamford's attorney, believing that they would prevail in court, invited the Department of Justice to prosecute, but no case was ever brought. In the wake of the dispute, classification rules were revised to allow document reclassification, and the contested documents were reclassified. NSA agents then visited libraries to remove other source documents from circulation.|$|E

25|$|Considering the country's {{brain drain}} and its poor {{political}} {{relationship with the}} United States and some other Western countries, Iran's scientific community remains productive, even while economic sanctions {{make it difficult for}} universities to buy equipment or to send people to the United States to attend scientific meetings. Furthermore, Iran considers scientific backwardness, as one of the root causes of political and military bullying by developed countries over developing states. After the Iranian Revolution, there have been efforts by the religious scholars to assimilate Islam with modern science and this is seen by some as the reason behind the recent successes of Iran to augment its scientific output. Currently Iran aims for a national goal of self-sustainment in all scientific arenas. Many individual Iranian scientists, along with the Iranian Academy of Medical Sciences and Academy of Sciences of Iran, are involved in this revival. The Comprehensive Scientific Plan has been devised based on about 51,000 <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> and includes 224 scientific projects that must be implemented by the year 2025.|$|E

The second is a [...] "work file" [...] which contains 279 <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents,</b> including numerous reports by Bolek on his co-workers at Gdańsk Shipyard, and notes by secret police officers from meetings with him. According to one note, Wałęsa agreed to collaborate out of fear of persecution after the workers’ protest in 1970. The documents also show that at first Bolek eagerly provided information on opinions and actions by his co-workers and took money for the information, but his enthusiasm diminished and the quality of his information decreased until he was deemed no longer valuable and collaboration with him was terminated in 1976.|$|E
