40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the complex three-dimensional flowfield of an oxygen safety <b>pressure</b> <b>relieve</b> <b>valve</b> during an incident, with a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis. Specifically, the analysis will provide a flow pattern that would lead to the expansion of the eventual erosion pattern of the hardware, so as to combine it with other findings to piece together a most likely scenario for the investigation. The CFD model is a pressure based solver. An adaptive upwind difference scheme is employed for the spatial discretization, and a predictor, multiple corrector method is used for the velocity-pressure coupling. The computational result indicated vortices formation near the opening of the valve which matched the erosion pattern of the damaged hardware...|$|E
5000|$|While most Functionalists {{sought to}} link ritual to the {{maintenance}} of social order, South African functionalist anthropologist Max Gluckman coined the phrase [...] "rituals of rebellion" [...] to describe a type of ritual in which the accepted social order was symbolically turned on its head. Gluckman argued that the ritual was an expression of underlying social tensions (an idea taken up by Victor Turner), and that it functioned as an institutional <b>pressure</b> <b>valve,</b> <b>relieving</b> those tensions through these cyclical performances. The rites ultimately functioned to reinforce social order, insofar as they allowed those tensions to be expressed without leading to actual rebellion. Carnival is viewed in the same light. He observed, for example, how the first-fruits festival (incwala) of the South African Bantu kingdom of Swaziland symbolically inverted the normal social order, so that the king was publicly insulted, women asserted their domination over men, and the established authority of elders over the young was turned upside down.|$|R

40|$|Background Pressure ulcer {{is one of}} {{many health}} {{problems}} in the healthcare system. Pressure ulcer prolongs the suffering of patients and the cost of treating them is high. In 2006, in the USA almost US$ 11 billion was spent on hospitalizations in which the patient was dignosed with pressure ulcer as primary or secondary causes, excluding neonatal and maternal conditions. This reflects an increase of nearly 80 % since 1993. Most pressure ulcers are potentially preventable; early and proper intervention to high risk groups can decrease the incidence of newly developed pressure ulcer and its consequence impacts. Moreover, pressure ulcer is a key performance index for assessing the quality of hospital service and patient safety. Maintaining a low incidence and prevalence of the pressure ulcer leads to both reduced health expenditure and patient’s suffering from wound pain. Aims and objectives The paper aims to study the current literature of <b>pressure</b> <b>relieving</b> devices application and its effectiveness to risk group. There are lots of <b>pressure</b> <b>relieving</b> devices in the market and here to assess its effectiveness to the risk group in hospital. Methods The electronic search was done through searching of electronic database, PubMed, MEDLINE ProQest; and hand search through Google Scholar and other online resources. Search strategies and criteria for inclusion and exclusion had been applied. The key words were used in retrieving studies through databases: (pressure ulcer OR decubitus ulcer) AND(prevention) AND (<b>pressure</b> <b>relieving</b> OR repositioning OR mattress OR cushion OR overlay OR re-distributing) Results There were twelve English articles for reviewing finally. Those articles were grouped into three <b>pressure</b> <b>relieving</b> device categories; they are cushion, re-positioning and mattresses for the review. In Defloor 2005, it found an obvious reduction in newly developed pressure ulcer if it combines 4 -hourly turning with pressure reliefing mattress; only 3 % of participants had newly developed pressure ulcer. Furthermore, the frequect turning may not reduce the pressure ulcer development in lower risk group. The proper intervention of <b>pressure</b> <b>relieving</b> and tailor to individuals are essential. Conclusions It demonstrated the effectiveness of <b>pressure</b> <b>relieving</b> devices to patient at risk, but the present of significant differences is not consistent. It is essential to ensure the utilization of the <b>pressure</b> <b>relieving</b> support surfaces function with right skill to the right person in order to maximize patient’s benefit during hospitalization.

40|$|Background. People with {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) are at {{increased}} risk of pressure ulcers due to prolonged periods of sitting. Concordance with <b>pressure</b> <b>relieving</b> movements is poor amongst this population, and one potential alternative to improve this would be to integrate <b>pressure</b> <b>relieving</b> movements into everyday functional activities. Objectives. To investigate both the current <b>pressure</b> <b>relieving</b> behaviours of SCI individuals during computer use and the application of an ergonomically adapted computer-based activity to reduce interface pressure. Design. Observational and repeated measures design. Setting. Regional Spinal Cord Injury Unit. Participants. Fourteen subjects diagnosed with SCI (12 male, 2 female). Intervention. Comparing normal sitting to seated movements and induced forward reaching positions. Main Outcome Measures. Interface pressure measurements: dispersion index (DI), peak pressure index (PPI), and total contact area (CA). The angle of trunk tilt was also measured. Results. The majority of movements yielded less than 25 % reduction in interface pressure compared to normal sitting. Reaching forward by 150 % of arm length during an adapted computer activity significantly reduced DI (P< 0. 05), angle of trunk tilt (p< 0. 05), and PPI for both ischial tuberosity regions (P< 0. 001) compared to normal sitting. Conclusion. Reaching forward significantly redistributed pressure at the seating interface, as evidenced by the change in interface pressures compared to upright sitting...|$|R

40|$|Cough is an {{important}} host-defense mechanism. The elderly and patients who are severely ill cannot cough effectively when lying in the supine position. Furthermore, <b>pressure</b> <b>relieving</b> air-mattresses are recommended for preventing the development of pressure ulcers. In this study, we clarified {{whether or not the}} cough peak flow (CPF), an index of cough strength, is affected by different firmness levels of a <b>pressure</b> <b>relieving</b> air-mattress in healthy volunteers in the supine position. Fifty-two healthy young men participated. All the measurements were carried out on each participant in the supine position on a <b>pressure</b> <b>relieving</b> air-mattress. The participants were assessed at two firmness levels, a "hard" and "soft" mode. The CPF, forced vital capacity (FVC), maximal expiratory pressure (PEmax), and maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) were determined for each mode. The sinking distance of the body into the mattress was measured without any activity and the difference between the sinking distances of the two firmness levels was determined. The CPF, FVC, PEmax, and PImax were determined for each mode. The sinking distance of the body into the mattress was measured and the difference between the sinking distances of the two firmness levels was determined. The CPF, FVC, PEmax and PImax values of the participants coughing on the mattress were significantly lower when the mattress was in "soft" than in "hard" mode. The differences between the sinking distances of the mattress in "soft" and "hard" modes were larger for the anterior superior iliac spine. A harder mattress may lead to increased CPF in healthy young men lying in the supine position, and increased CPF may be important for host defense...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Pressure relief done by {{a spinal}} cord injured patient is of utmost {{importance}} {{in order to prevent}} pressure sore formation. Some pressure-relieving techniques are described in previous literature, but their effectivity has not yet been deter- mined on different wheelchair cushions.

Design: An analytical experimental study design using a convenient sample group of ten complete lesion quadriplegics (C 6 to T 1) was performed at the Physiotherapy Department, University of Pretoria. Method: Interface pressure (in mmHg) over the ischial tuberosities and upper thigh areas was measured using the Talley Oxford Pressure Monitor MKII with a 12 -way matrix cell system.

Various nonsurgical approaches, such as intraabdominal fluid drainage and neuromuscular blockade, have been shown to reduce intraabdominal pressure [8]. A decompression laparotomy should be considered to <b>relieve</b> <b>pressure</b> and restore capillary perfusion in the organs of critically ill patients [4, 5]. In the present case, a relatively long period of time was needed to make a diagnosis of ACS, as there were several points to check to determine the reason for instability of cardiopulmonary bypass due to the small incision and insufficient view of the heart, vessels, and other side of the pleural cavity, which might have caused massive fluid resuscitation and requirement of extracorporeal membrane oxygen. Once a decompression laparotomy was performed and intraabdominal <b>pressure</b> <b>relieved,</b> hemodynamic status dramatically improved, and massive urine output led to early abdominal closure.|$|R
