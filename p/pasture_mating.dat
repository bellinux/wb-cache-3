A multiplicity of systems for <b>pasture</b> <b>mating</b> are presently in use. Bulls are mated singly or in groups, they are set-stocked during the mating period or rotated about the different groups of cows, they are mated {{at the rate of}} 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 bulls per 100 cows, young bulls are mated to cows in company with old bulls or other young bulls (Dickson 1966). There is little scientific basis for any of these mating systems since basic information on the sexual and social behaviour of beef bulls at pasture is lacking. Such data are needed so that optimum use can be made of beef bulls in <b>pasture</b> <b>mating.</b> (For complete abstract open document) Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|An {{association}} between equine recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) and increased resistance to intestinal parasites {{has been demonstrated}} in descendants of an RAO-affected stallion. It was hypothesised that members of another high-incidence RAO family (F) and unrelated RAO-affected Warmblood horses (UA) would shed fewer strongylid eggs than unrelated RAO-unaffected <b>pasture</b> <b>mates</b> (PM) under the same environmental conditions. Faecal worm egg counts were performed on faecal samples (63 F, 86 UA, 149 PM) and classified into three categories: 0, 1 - 100 and > 100 eggs per gram. While results for F {{did not differ from}} PM, UA were 2. 5 -times less likely to shed strongylid eggs than PM. RAO-affected Warmblood horses may be more resistant to strongylid nematodes than unrelated unaffected <b>pasture</b> <b>mates</b> and a family history of RAO does not necessarily confer protection against helminth infections...|$|R

40|$|A {{recent study}} showed {{increased}} resistance against strongylid nematodes in offspring of a stallion affected by recurrent airway obstruction (RAG) compared with unrelated <b>pasture</b> <b>mates.</b> Resistance against strongylid nematodes {{was associated with}} RAG affection. Hypothesis: Resistance against strongylid nematodes has a genetic basis. The genetic variants influencing strongylid resistance also influence RAG susceptibility. Faecal samples from the half-sibling offspring of two RAG-affected Warmblood stallions 98 offspring from the first family (family 1) and 79 from the second family (family 2) were analysed using a combined sedimentation-flotation method. The phenotype {{was defined as a}} binary trait - either positive or negative for egg shedding. The influence of non-genetic factors on egg shedding was analysed using SAS, the mode of inheritance was investigated using PAP and iBay, and the association between shedding of strongyle eggs and RAG was estimated by odds ratios. Previously established genotypes for 315 microsatellite markers were used for QTL analyses using GRID QTL. The inheritance of "strongylid egg shedding" is influenced by major genes on ECA 15 and ECA 20. Shedding of strongylid eggs is associated with RAG in family 1 but not in family 2. Conclusions: The status of "shedding of strongyle eggs" has a genetic background. The results were inconclusive as to whether "egg shedding" and RAG share common genetic components. Our results suggest that {{it may be possible to}} select for resistance against strongylid nematodes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Equine {{recurrent}} airway obstruction (RAO) shares many characteristics {{with human}} asthma. In humans, {{an inverse relationship}} between susceptibility to asthma and resistance to parasites is suspected. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Members of a high-incidence RAO half-sibling family (F) shed fewer strongylid eggs compared with RAO-unaffected <b>pasture</b> <b>mates</b> (PM) and that RAO-affected horses shed fewer eggs than RAO-unaffected half-siblings. ANIMALS: Seventy-three F and 73 unrelated, age matched PM. METHODS: Cases and controls kept under the same management and deworming regime were examined. Each individual was classified as RAO affected or RAO unaffected and fecal samples were collected before and 1 - 3 weeks and 3 months after deworming. Samples were analyzed by combined sedimentation-flotation and modified McMaster methods and classified into 3 categories of 0 eggs per gram of feces (EpG), 1 - 100 EpG, and > 100 EpG, respectively. RESULTS: PM compared with RAO-affected F had a 16. 7 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 2. 0 - 136. 3) times higher risk for shedding > 100 EpG compared with 0 EpG and a 5. 3 (95 % CI: 1. 0 - 27. 4) times higher risk for shedding > 100 EpG compared with 0 EpG. There was no significant effect when RAO-unaffected F were compared with their PM. RAO-unaffected compared with RAO-affected offspring had a 5. 8 (95 % CI: 0. 0 - 1. 0) times higher risk for shedding 1 - 100 EpG. Age, sex, breed, and sharing pastures with other species had no significant confounding effects.

40|$|A {{total of}} 4, 778 cows from 179 herds were tested for {{antibodies}} to N. caninum using a commercially availableELISA. Neospora caninum herd-level seroprevalence ranged from 25. 0 % to 75. 9 % (a herd was considered positive with ¡Ý 2 cows testing positive). The true cow prevalence was estimated as 5. 2 % (95 % CI= 4. 6 ¨C 5. 8). ¡°Pre-calving use of dry lots¡±, ¡°separation of cow-calf pair from other cows after calving¡±, ¡°use of standing water in summer¡±, ¡°use of running water in winter¡±, ¡°feeding heifers with manure handling equipment¡±, ¡°abortion and stillbirths left for canids¡± and ¡°number of sightings of wild canids per year¡± (categorized into three categories: less than 10 times per year, 11 ¨C 25 times per year, and greater than 26 times per year) were positivelyassociated with herd serological status. However, ¡°washing boots between visits to livestock farms¡± was {{negatively associated with}} serological status. These 8 variables were included in a multivariable logistic regression model. Province and herd size were considered potential confounders and kept in the model regardless of significance. Only 4 variables remained significant in the final model. Risk factors associated with prevalence included the use of dry lots/corrals as pre-calving area (OR= 2. 8; 95 % CI = 1. 3 ¨C 6. 2), the use of natural standing water in summer (OR= 3. 2; 95 %CI= 1. 31 ¨C 8. 0), and leaving abortions/stillbirths for dogs or wild canids (OR= 2. 5; 95 %CI= 1. 0 ¨C 5. 9). As the frequency of sighting coyotes and foxes increased so did herd seroprevalence to N. caninum. Risk factors suggested the likely role of horizontal transmission in the transmission of N. caninum in these beef cow-calf herds. Beef herd managers might consider biosecurity practices such as preventing the access of wild canids to fetuses and stillbirths thereby preventing pasture contamination and controlling contamination of water source with oocyst of N. caninum thereby reducing chances of infection. 	Aherd was considered positive for Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) if ¡Ý 1 animal tested positive. Estimates of cow-level seroprevalence was 1. 01 % (95 % CI= 0. 73 % ¨C 1. 29 %) while herd seroprevalence was 12. 4 % (95 % CI= 7. 57 ¨C 17. 23). Potential risk factors examined for BLV transmission included the use of blade or surgical castration without disinfection between animals, using gouger and saw dehorning methods, multi-use of common rectal sleeve between cows without disinfection {{and the use of}} communal <b>pasture</b> where <b>mating</b> occurred. No associations existed between potential risk factors and seropositivity to BLV because the number of herds testing positive to BLV were too few to find any association. However, management practices observed in this study may have the potential to transmit infections. Lapses in biosecurity practices identified were addition of new animals to the herds(73. 7 %, 132 / 179), the use of communal grazing (24. 0 % (43 / 179) of herds using with 28 % (12 / 43) using more than one communal <b>pasture</b> where <b>mating</b> occurred(93 %, 40 / 43) with bulls from other herds.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} the neotropical savannas of Carimagua, Colombia {{to test the hypothesis}} that Brahman females subjected to sustained grazing undernutrition as heifers can attain high reproductive performance as mature cows if allowed to make compensatory gains. In Experiment 1, weaned heifers were subjected to three rates of weight gain (H, M and L) on a poor quality tropical <b>pasture</b> until reaching <b>mating</b> weight of 270 kg. Each group was then subdivided and grazed on pastures that allowed high (h) or low (l) weights gains. Experiment 2 allowed heifers of the same type to achieve continuous high weight gains and served as a control. Regardless of earlier treatment, all h cows in Experiment 1 achieved mature body size and reproductive performance comparable to those of the well-fed animals of Experiment 2. It is concluded that the potential exists {{for a wide range of}} grazing managements of Brahman heifers in the tropics, and it is possible to achieve levels of performance that represent a substantial improvement over current standards at a modest management cost.

40|$|Abstract – A {{hierarchical}} {{animal model}} {{was developed for}} inference on genetic merit of livestock with uncertain paternity. Fully conditional posterior distributions for fixed and genetic effects, variance components, sire assignments and their probabilities are derived to facilitate a Bayesian inference strategy using MCMC methods. We compared this model to a model based on the Henderson average numerator relationship (ANRM) in a simulation study with 10 replicated datasets generated for each of two traits. Trait 1 had a medium heritability (h 2) for each of direct and maternal genetic effects whereas Trait 2 had a high h 2 attributable only to direct effects. The average posterior probabilities inferred on the true sire were between 1 and 10 % larger than the corresponding priors (the inverse {{of the number of}} candidate sires in a <b>mating</b> <b>pasture)</b> for Trait 1 and between 4 and 13 % larger than the corresponding priors for Trait 2. The predicted additive and maternal genetic effects were very similar using both models; however, model choice criteria (Pseudo Bayes Factor and Deviance Information Criterion) decisively favored the proposed hierarchical model over the ANRM model...|$|R
40|$|Exposure {{of female}} fetuses to {{environmental}} chemicals (ECs) during pregnancy {{results in a}} disturbed ovarian adult phenotype. We investigated the influence of pre- and/or post-conception exposure to low-level mixtures of ECs on the structure and function of the fetal ovine ovary. We examined ovarian morphology, expression of oocyte and granulosa cell-specific genes and proteome. Female fetuses were collected at day 110 of gestation, from dams exposed continuously until, and after mating, by grazing in pastures treated with sewage sludge as a fertiliser (TT) or in control fields treated with inorganic fertiliser (CC). In addition, in a cross-over design, fetal ovaries were collected from dams maintained on sludge pastures up {{to the time of}} mating but then transferred to control pastures (TC) and, reciprocally, those transferred from control to treated <b>pastures</b> at <b>mating</b> (CT). On examination, the proportion of type 1 a follicles (activating primordial follicles) was significantly lower in animals from the CT groups compared with CC and TT groups (P&# 60; 0. 05). Of the 23 ovarian gene transcripts studied, 14 were altered in the ovaries of exposed fetuses (CT, TC, and TT) relative to controls, with the largest number of changes observed in cross-exposure pattern groups (CT or TC). Continuous EC exposure (TT) produced fewer transcript alterations and only two genes (INHBA and GSN) presented differential profiles between CC and TT. Fetal ovarian proteome analysis (2 -DE gels) showed, across all exposure groups, 86 differentially expressed protein spots compared to controls. Animals in the CT group exhibited the highest number (53) while TC and TT presented the same number of affected protein spots (42). Fetal ovarian proteins with altered expression included MVP (major vault protein) and several members of the heat-shock family (HSPA 4 L, HSP 90 AA 1 and HSF 1). The present findings indicate that continuous maternal EC exposure before and during gestation, are less deleterious for fetal ovarian development than a change in maternal EC exposure between pre and post-conception. The pathways by which the ovary responds to this chemical stress were common in TT, CT, TC exposed foetuses. In addition to the period of pregnancy, the pre-conception period appears also as crucial for conditioning long-term effects of EC exposure on ovarian development and primordial follicle reserve and hence future fertility...|$|R
40|$|Forty-four Hampshire (H) and 41 Suffolk (S) ewes were allotted within breed {{to one of}} four {{treatment}} groups (VitA, VitE, VitAE, and Control) to evaluate the effect of supplemental vitamin E and A on reproductive performance of ewes <b>mated</b> on <b>pasture</b> or in drylot.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a series of}} four experiments designed to evaluate {{the role of the}} supply of protein in livestock grazing high quality <b>pasture</b> during <b>mating</b> and during pregnancy. The first two studies investigated the effects of high crude protein content of spring or autumn re-growth pasture on the reproductive performance of dairy cows and of ewes at mating. The last two studies investigated how the dietary supply of protein, body condition and their interactions contribute to the breakdown of immunity during the peri-parturient period in ewes and investigated underlying endocrine mechanisms. In the first study (Chapter 3) cows were blood sampled via the tail vein during the breeding period in spring. Plasma was then analysed for urea concentration. Cows with high plasma urea (HPU) or low plasma urea (LPU) were defined as those with plasma urea concentrations of ≥ or 0. 05) between HPU and LPU cows. Gestation length, calving rate, milk yield and milk components were also similar (P > 0. 05) between LPU and HPU cows. There was no difference (P > 0. 05) in plasma urea concentrations between HMP and LMP milk producers. However, calving to conception interval, interval between calving and first service and calving interval were longer (P 0. 05) between HMP and LMP cows. HMP had lower (P 0. 05) between HPP and BH and between HU and LU ewes. Ewes with previous high reproductive performance (HP) as would be expected had higher ovulation rate (P 0. 05) influence embryo mortality. Foetal loss, neonatal loss, total reproductive loss and mean lamb birth weight was were not affected by diet, nor urea category (P > 0. 05). Single ovulations had tended (P = 0. 08) to contribute to higher embryo loss compared to multiple ovulations, and, single foetuses suffered higher (P 0. 05) in lamb performance due to body condition or protein supplementation. FEC of all groups was low (≈ 9 peg) and there was no (P > 0. 05) significant difference between ewes of different body condition or due to effects of protein supplementation. Ewes bearing/bearing multiple lambs had the highest FEC at day - 32 and + 12 relative to lambing, which was significant (P < 0. 05) on the latter date. There were no significant effects of supplementation on parasite status. There were differences in basal plasma glucose concentration between groups (P < 0. 001), being highest in HM/S and least in ML/NS ewes and was generally higher (P < 0. 001) during GTT 2 than GTT 1. Ewes carrying a single foetus had higher (P < 0. 001) basal glucose than those carrying multiple lambs (2. 2 vs. 1. 7 mmol/L, respectively). Other plasma glucose response indexes were similar (P < 0. 05) between groups. There were differences in insulin responsiveness between groups (P < 0. 001), being highest in MH/S and least in ML/S ewes. Insulin responsiveness tended (P = 0. 06) to be lower during GTT 1 than GTT 2, but was higher (P < 0. 01) in ewes carrying singles than multiples. There was tendency for higher though non-significant, basal insulin concentrations in HM ewes. Insulin trends over time after glucose infusion suggest greater insulin response at GTT 1. Basal insulin was not correlated with CT muscle weight. Despite differences in body muscle mass {{at the start of the}} trial and differences induced by nutrition during late pregnancy, positive gains in muscle mass occurred during early pregnancy and muscle mass was similar in all groups by day 56 of lactation. Animals with greatest fat content at parturition (HM) mobilised the greatest amount and those with least fat (LM) deposited fat during lactation. Further experimentation may consider the use of the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp approach to more precisely estimate whether hormonal re-setting through insulin resistance may be involved in relaxation of immunity during the peri-parturient period...|$|R

Os animais foram mantidos em pastagem nativa por 45 dias e, após este período, distribuídos em três sistemas alimentares (SA) por um período de 80 dias (1 / 6 / 2001 a 20 / 8 / 2001) : CN+FA - suplementação em pastagem nativa (CN) com farelo de arroz desengordurado (FA); SB+FA - confinamento a céu aberto com silagem de sorgo de baixa qualidade (SB) e FA; SS+RC - confinamento a céu aberto com silagem de sorgo de qualidade superior e ração comercial (RC). Após o término dos SA, os animais permaneceram, em lote único, em pastagem de azevém (Lolium multiflorum Lam) até final de novembro e em pastagem nativa durante o período de acasalamento. Foram avaliados peso corporal (PC), escore de condição corporal (ECC), ganho de peso médio diário (GMD) e taxa de prenhez (TP). Durante os SA, o GMD das novilhas SS+RC (0, 480 kg) foi superior aos demais e das SB+FA (0, 252 kg), superior às CN+FA (0, 174 kg). Na pastagem de azevém, os ganhos foram semelhantes (0, 436 kg/dia), assim como no período de acasalamento (0, 519 kg/dia). No período de acasalamento, as novilhas SS+RC foram mais pesadas e tiveram maior ECC em relação à do CN+FA. A TP média foi de 17 %, sem diferenças entre os SA. As novilhas Braford apresentaram maior PV e CC ao acasalamento e maior TP que as Hereford. As novilhas prenhes foram as mais pesadas e de maior ECC à desmama, ao início e fim dos SA e do acasalamento, as mais velhas e com maiores GMD no período avaliado. The {{objective of}} this work was to evaluate the development post weaning and the reproductive performance at 13 / 15 months old of 56 Hereford and 52 Braford female calves, with average body weight of 126 kg, body condition score of 2. 5 and six months old. The animals were kept in natural pasture (CN) during 45 days and after this period, allotted to three feeding systems (SA) {{for a period of}} 80 days (06 / 01 / 2001 to 08 / 20 / 2001) : CN + FA - supplementation of CN with defatted rice bran (FA); SB + FA - open sky feedlot with low quality sorghum silage (SB) and FA; SS + RC - open sky feedlot with higher quality sorghum silage (SS) and commercial concentrate (RC). After the end of SA, the animals were kept, as a unique group, on ryegrass pasture (Lolium multiflorum Lam) until end of November and on natural <b>pasture</b> during the <b>mating</b> period. Body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS), average weight gain (AWG) and pregnancy rate (PR) were evaluated. During the SA, the AWG of the SS + RC (0. 480 kg) was higher than the other systems, and of the SB + FA (0. 252 kg) higher than CN + FA (0. 174 kg).

40|$|A {{series of}} grazing {{experiments}} was conducted, in the summer/autumn of 2001, 2002 and 2003, {{to investigate the}} effects of poplar (Populus spp.) and/or willow (Salix spp.) supplementation, during mating, on ewe production and reproduction when grazing drought pasture. Each experiment involved a rotational grazing system with 300 mixed-age Romney ewes, divided into three groups of 100 ewes each. In each year, all ewes were offered low quality simulated drought pasture, containing more than 60 % dead matter, at an allowance sufficient to provide a potential desired intake of 0. 70 kg dry matter (DM) /day, for periods of 9 to 12 weeks, including two mating cycles. Mean pre-and post-grazing pasture masses averaged over the three years were 1100 and 600 kg DM/ha. The pasture consumed in all years was typical of pasture available to grazing livestock in a drought; it was high in neutral detergent fibre (NDF; approximately 600 g/kg DM), low in organic matter digestibility (OMD, approximately 0. 52) and metabolisable energy (ME; approximately 7. 5 MJ/kg DM) and contained approximately 20 g nitrogen (N) /kg DM. The supplementary poplar and willow diets were always superior to drought pasture consumed by the ewes, being higher in OMD (approximately 0. 67), ME (approximately 10 MJ/kg DM) and total N (approximately 26 g/kg DM) and lower in NDF (approximately 383 g/kg DM). Tree fodder diets also contained substantial concentrations of the secondary compounds condensed tannin (CT; range 7 to 52 g/kg DM), salicin (approximately 2 g/kg DM) and other phenolic glycosides (approximately 21 g/kg DM), with willow (27 to 52 g/kg DM) containing greater concentrations of CT compared with poplar (7 to 19 g/kg DM). Mean diameter of the tree fodder stem consumed during the series of experiments was approximately 7 mm for poplar and 4 mm for willow with the diameter increasing over the experimental periods in four cases out of live (P< 0. 05). After the supplementation period, the three groups were joined together and grazed on perennial ryegrass/white clover pasture until the conclusion of each experiment at weaning. In all years, the effect of poplar and/or willow supplementation on ewe live weight (LW) and body condition score (BCS) change; the proportion of lambs (reproductive rate) at pregnancy scanning, lambing, docking and weaning; and wool production and staple length from ewe fleeces with approximately 11 months growth, were measured. Experiment 1 was designed {{to determine how much}} poplar fodder needed to be fed to increase ewe production and reproduction over a 71 -day supplementation period. The experiment involved a high supplementation group, offered 1. 5 kg fresh poplar/ewe/day; a low supplementation group, offered 0. 75 kg fresh poplar/ewe/day; and a control group that was offered no tree fodder. Ewes in the high and low treatments lost less LW (- 67 and - 71 vs. - 82 g/day; P< 0. 05) and BCS (- 0. 78 and - 1. 27 vs. - 1. 31 units; P< 0. 05) compared with unsupplemented ewes. Reproductive rate was relatively low in the control group (121 lambs born/ 100 ewes mated), with poplar supplementation increasing ewe reproductive rate by approximately 20 % units (P< 0. 05) and 30 % units (P< 0. 001) for the low and high treatment groups, respectively, at scanning, lambing, docking and weaning. The increase in reproductive rate in supplemented ewes was due to increases in both conception rate (number of ewes pregnant/ 100 ewes mated) and fecundity (number of lambs born/ 100 ewes mated). Experiment 2 was designed to determine if production and reproduction varied between ewes fed poplar versus willow at the same rate of supplementation, 1. 4 kg fresh forage/ewe/day, for 87 days. Again, reproductive rate was relatively low in the control group (133 lambs born/ 100 ewes mated), with willow supplementation reducing L. W loss (- 86 g/day vs. - 103 g/day; P< 0. 01) and increasing reproductive rate by 15 %, 17 % 21 % and 20 % units at ultrasound scanning (P= 0. 097), lambing (P= 0. 087), docking (P< 0. 05) and weaning (P= 0. 058), respectively. The increase in reproductive rate was due to an increase in fecundity; supplementation did not affect conception rate in this experiment. Unlike the previous experiment, poplar supplementation showed no effect on reproductive rate, despite the increase in DM intake and the apparent reduction in LW loss of 9 g/day (P- 0. 11). It is likely that severe contamination of the poplar fodder with Melampsora larici-populina, or poplar leaf rust, confounded the results. Building on the results of the first two grazing trials, {{the next step was to}} determine the period (days) of tree fodder supplementation necessary to achieve a response in reproductive rate. Experiment 3 involved ewes fed 1. 3 kg fresh willow/ewe/day for a 'long' period, 63 days including 6 weeks of mating, and a 'short' period, 31 days including 3 weeks of mating. The mating period commenced on the same day for all groups and lasted for 6 weeks. Willow supplementation for 63 days reduced ewe LW loss (- 96 g/day vs. - 147 g/day; P< 0. 05) and BCS (- 0. 79 VS. - 1. 09; P< 0. 05) loss, compared with unsupplemented ewes; however, it did not increase reproductive rate at scanning and lambing. The lack of response in willow-supplemented ewes was likely to be due to toxic concentrations of zearalenone (1. 5 mg/kg DM), an oestrogenic mycotoxin, in the drought <b>pasture</b> during <b>mating,</b> which confounded the results by negating any potential benefits due to increased nutrient intakes. Willow supplementation for 63 days did increase reproductive rate at weaning by 13 % units, due to a 9 % unit (P< 0. 05) reduction in post-natal lamb mortality, from 17. 1 to 8. 4 %. Supplementation for 31 days did not appear to influence ewe reproduction and production parameters. Overall, the rate of LW loss was greater in Experiment 3 compared with the first two experiments. Seven indoor in vivo digestibility experiments were conducted at the following times; early April 2001 (poplar), February, March and April 2002 (all poplar), and December, March and April 2003 (all willow). Each 14 -day trial involved 6 male cryptorchid lambs, individually fed in metabolism cages. The experiments showed that the digestibility of poplar and willow tree fodder declined from late spring to autumn (P< 0. 05), but that the decline was much smaller than the decline in digestibility of grass-based pastures in New Zealand over the same time period. The experiments also showed that mean ME and digestibilities were generally higher for willow than for poplar. The seven in vivo digestibility coefficients were then used to develop a standard curve for in vitro prediction of in vivo digestibility, this standard was used to analyse all unknown tree fodder samples from the three grazing experiments. Results from the three grazing experiments showed that supplementing ewes grazing drought <b>pasture</b> during <b>mating</b> with poplar and willow tree fodder consistently increased DM intake by 0. 25 to 0. 33 kg DM/ewe/day for ewes offered 1. 3 to 1. 5 kg fresh willow or poplar each day and increased calculated total DM intakes from 0. 67 to 1. 03 kg DM/ewe/day in Experiment 1, from 0. 59 to 0. 86 kg DM/ewe/day in Experiment 2 and from 0. 47 to 0. 75 kg DM/ewe/day in Experiment 3. Supplementation also consistently reduced LW loss and loss in BCS and substantially increased lambing rate through increased conception rate and fecundity and reduced post-natal lamb mortality. The effects on LW and BCS gradually declined in the post-treatment period and were no longer evident by commencement of lambing. There was no effect of supplementation on wool production or staple length in any of the experiments. One of the unexpected results of the experiments was an average 34 % reduction in post-natal lamb mortality over three years, due to willow/poplar supplementation of ewes during mating. Initial results showed that despite significant increases in fecundity in supplemented ewes in 2001 and 2002, post-natal lamb mortality was not increased. This result, combined with a statistically significant reduction in lamb mortality in Experiment 3 (P< 0. 05), in the absence of any differences in fecundity between the groups, suggested that tree fodder supplementation during mating may have reduced lamb mortality in all three years, but that the effect was masked by the increase in reproductive rate in the first two experiments. Therefore, data from the three field trials were combined and analysed by adjusting all mortality data to equal birth rank and sex; this showed a significant reduction due to supplementation (P< 0. 05) with no treatment-year interaction. The increase in ewe production and reproduction in supplemented ewes was likely due to increases in nutrient intake, through increased DM, ME and CP intakes, prior to and during mating and to increased outputs of undegradable dietary protein and microbial protein from the rumen, per unit of crude protein consumed, thus increasing amino acid absorption. An increase in ovulation rate of 1. 5 % units/MJ of digestible energy consumed (Smith 1985) should result in increases in ovulation rate due to tree fodder supplementation of only 5 and 4 % units in 2001 and 2002, respectively; however, the increases in scanning rate were substantially greater at 41 and 16 % units. Therefore, it is possible that the majority of the increase in reproductive rate was due to increased essential amino acid absorption, which is consistent with increases found in ewes mated on CT-containing forages such as Lotus corniculatus (Birdsfoot trefoil). Gross margin analyses using actual data from unsupplemented ewes in each of the three grazing trials compared with Riverside Farm's commercial ewes from the same years showed that drought reduced scanning rates by an average of 22. 4 % and wool production by 20 % and that this reduction decreases sheep production income by approximately $ 14 /ewe. Further analysis showed that almost half the cost ($ 6 /ewe) could be recovered by supplementing ewes with tree fodder in a drought. On a whole farm basis this represents $ 58 /hectare cost benefit due to tree fodder supplementation. Fungal contamination was a significant factor in the results obtained in Experiments 2 and 3. In all years, simulated drought pasture contained metabolites of zearalenone and the trichothecenes nivalenol and deoxy-nivalenol, produced by Fusarium fungi, while in Experiment 2 the poplar was severely contaminated with Melampsora larici-populina, or poplar leaf rust. Zearalenone concentrations in pasture were at their greatest in Experiment 3 and increased to over 2 mg/kg DM during the mating period. This may explain the lack of increase in reproductive rate expected in willow-supplemented ewes in Experiment 3, which was a feature of previous experiments; however, it did not explain the much greater loss in ewe LW in Experiment 3. Nivalenol (NIV) and deoxy-nivalenol (DON) are common trichothecene toxins found in New Zealand pasture and were found in pasture samples from all three experiments, however, the concentration in Experiment 3 was three- to four-fold greater than in previous experiments. Reports have suggested that trichothecenes may be partly responsible for the reduced growth of otherwise healthy livestock grazing dry autumn pasture, often referred to as 'ill thrift'. However, based on evidence from dosing experiments, it is unlikely that the quantities of NIV and DON present in pasture in Experiment 3 accounted for all of the greater LW loss seen in this experiment. This suggests that these toxins are likely to be indicators of other more potent fungal toxins, which have a much bigger impact on livestock health and production. It is likely that fungal toxins contribute more to reduced reproduction in breeding ewes and to ill thrift in young stock grazing dry autumn pastures in East Coast regions than is currently acknowledge...|$|R
40|$|Five {{rotational}} grazing experiments {{were carried out}} at Massey University's Riverside farm, in the Wairarapa, on the East Coast of the Southern North Island, New Zealand, to compare the effects of feeding Lotus corniculatus L. (birdsfoot trefoil; cv. Grasslands Goldie) or perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) /white clover (Trifolium repens) dominant pasture upon sheep year round productivity. These studies also investigated under grazing, seasonal and annual net herbage accumulation rate and seasonal dynamics of undisturbed (i. e. non-grazed) net herbage accumulation rate of L. corniculatus relative to that of grass-dominant pasture. Aspects of in vivo digestibility of dry matter (DMD), organic matter (OMD), digestible organic matter in the dry matter (DOMD) and metabolisable energy (ME) concentration of L. corniculatus {{at different stages of}} maturity over the spring, summer and autumn were investigated in three indoor digestion trials. 1. Two field experiments (Chapter 2) were conducted during spring to assess the effects of grazing mixed age undrenched ewes on L. corniculatus (n = 50) or pasture (n = 50) and their lambs (mainly twins) on live weight (LW), wool production, faecal nematode egg count (FEC) and dag score. In Experiment 1 (18 October 2000 to 21 January 2001) and Experiment 2 (3 October 2001 to 2 January 2002) both forages were fed ad libitum. Total condensed tannin (CT) concentration in the diet selected was 24 to 27 g CT/kg DM for L. corniculatus and 1. 4 to 1. 5 g CT/kg DM for pasture. The LW gain, weaning LW and wool production were consistently greater (P < 0. 001) for lambs grazing L. corniculatus, in either Experiment 1 (258 vs. 189 g/day; 36. 1 vs. 30. 1 kg; 1. 17 vs. 0. 98 kg) and in Experiment 2 (247 vs. 162 g/day; 31. 8 vs. 24. 1 kg; 1. 17 vs. 0. 81 kg), respectively. Ewe and lamb dag scores were strongly and positively correlated with dag weight (P < 0. 001) and generally increased with time in sheep grazing pasture, whilst grazing on L. corniculatus consistently reduced dag score. FEC in ewes grazing pasture showed a post-parturient rise (PPR) following lambing, whilst ewes grazing L. corniculatus had a reduced PPR in FEC. Up to day 70, FEC in lambs grazing L. corniculatus was lower than that for lambs grazing pasture, but between day 70 and the end of both experiments (approximately day 90), FEC in lambs grazing L. corniculatus increased to similar values as for pasture-fed lambs. FEC was not correlated with dag score or dag weight in ewes or lambs grazing pasture, but these indices were weakly and positively correlated in ewes and lambs grazing L. corniculatus, suggesting that lowering FEC on L. corniculatus also reduced dag formation. It was concluded that under dryland farming conditions, the use of L. corniculatus during the spring/early summer lactation period can increase lamb LW and wool production, whilst eliminating the need for pre-lambing anthelmintic drenching and probably reducing the amount of insecticide needed to control flystrike. These effects compared to pasture are probably due to higher digestibilty, higher ME concentration, higher voluntary feed intake (VFI), and to the effect of CT in reducing rumen protein degradability and controlling internal parasites in sheep grazing L. corniculatus. The absence of endophyte in L. corniculatus may have also have contributed to these effects. 2. During 2001 and 2002 (Chapter 3), grazing trials from February to November were conducted for 279 days (Experiments 1) and 285 days (Experiment 2), to compare the effects of grazing shorn mixed age Romney ewes in light condition on L. corniculatus versus <b>pasture</b> during the <b>mating</b> period (9 weeks, Experiment 1) and 11 weeks (Experiment 2). In Experiment 2, the length of time (days) that ewes need to graze L. corniculatus before mating to maximise reproductive performance was also investigated. Common objectives in both Experiments were to measure forage feeding effects on ewe wool production and LW of their lambs at weaning. In Experiment 1, groups of ewes (n = 100) were fed on either L. corniculatus or pasture at a herbage allowance of 1. 8 kg green DM/ewe/day for the first three weeks of feeding and increased to ad libitum (2. 3 kg green DM/ewe/day) during the mating period for two cycles. In Experiment 2, groups of 75 ewes grazed L. corniculatus for 42, 21, 10 and 0 days before a synchronised oestrus, with pasture being grazed for the balance of the 42 days. All L. corniculatus groups continued grazing L. corniculatus for a further 5 weeks. Feed allowance was initially 2. 0 kg green DM/ewe/day, increased to 2. 3 kg green DM/ewe/day during the mating period over the two cycles. At the end of L. corniculatus feeding in both experiments the groups were combined and grazed on pasture until weaning. Total CT concentration in the diet selected was 18 to 29 g CT/kg DM for L. corniculatus, with only trace amounts in pasture. In Experiment 1 mating ewes on L. corniculatus compared to pasture increased number of lambs born and lambs weaned per ewe lambing by 16 and 32 % units respectively (P < 0. 05), due to more multiple and less single births (P = 0. 06) and to reduced lamb mortality (P < 0. 05) between birth and weaning. In Experiment 2, increasing the numbers of days of grazing L. corniculatus before ovulation (0, 10, 21, 42 days) linearly increased ovulation rate (P < 0. 05), lambs born and lamb weaned by up to 16 % units, but had no effect upon lamb mortality. Mating ewes on L. corniculatus increased wool production (P < 0. 01) and fibre length (P < 0. 05) in Experiment 1 but not in Experiment 2. Grazing L. corniculatus had no effect on lamb birth weight and only small positive effects on weaning LW. It was concluded that, under commercial dryland farming conditions, the use of L. corniculatus during the mating season in late summer/autumn can be used to increase reproductive efficiency and wool production, with the largest responses in years with exceptionally dry autumn periods. These effects are probably due to the higher digestibility and ME concentration of L. corniculatus than pasture and to the CT in L. corniculatus reducing rumen protein degradability and leading to greater essential amino acid (EAA) absorption from the small intestine. Effects of forage CT upon the uterine microenvironment at the time of conception, implantation and early foetal growth, need to be investigated in future studies. It is also suggested that effects of mating on L. corniculatus upon lamb mortality between birth and weaning should be further investigated with ewe numbers/treatment increased from 100 to 350. 3. During the summer of 2002 / 2003, another grazing trial (Chapter 4 : 95 days) compared the effects of grazing L. corniculatus and pasture on LW and the dynamics of nematode parasite infection in Suffolk x Romney weaned lambs fed ad libitum. Half of the lambs (n = 30) grazing either L. corniculatus or pasture received oral anthelmintic at the start and at monthly intervals (regular-drenched groups), whilst the remaining 30 lambs in each treatment only received oral anthelmintic when mean faecal nematode egg counts (FECs) exceed 1, 000 eggs/g wet faeces (trigger-drenched groups), which occurred on day 58 only for both groups. Trigger and regular-drench lambs grazed separate areas. Total CT concentration in the diet selected was 40 to 31 g CT/kg DM for L. corniculatus, with only trace amounts in pasture. Regular-drenched lambs grazing L. corniculatus had significantly higher LW gain (298 g/day) and carcass weight gain (133 g/day) than all the other groups, whilst trigger-drenched lambs grazing L. corniculatus had significantly greater LW gain (228 g/day) and carcass gain (99 g/day) than regular-drenched (200; 66 g/day) and trigger-drenched (187; 63 g/day) lambs grazing pasture. Carcass fatness was significantly lower for trigger-drenched lambs than for regular-drenched lambs, when fed either L. corniculatus or pasture. Dag score was consistently lower for regular-drenched lambs grazing L. corniculatus than pasture; trigger-drenched lambs showed similar effects up to day 48, with no {{differences between the two groups}} thereafter. Regular anthelmintic treatment maintained FECs at low values, while parasitised lambs on L. corniculatus tended to have higher FECs than pasture-fed lambs. Relative to trigger-drenched lambs that grazed pasture, grazing trigger-drenched lambs on L. corniculatus had significantly reduced worm burdens of Haemochus contortus, Teladosargia spp., Nematodirus spp. and Cooperia spp. at slaughter, but greater burdens of Trichostrongylus spp., Chabertia ovina, Oesophagostonum spp. and Trichuris ovis were present in L. corniculatus-fed lambs. It was concluded that grazing L. corniculatus under dryland farming conditions compared to pasture can increase LW gain of weaned lambs, whilst reducing reliance on anthelmintic drenches to control parasites. These effects are probably due to increased protein supply from the action of CT enabling the lambs to have a higher LW gain when carrying a parasite burden, and to L. corniculatus better maintaining its high ME value under drought conditions. Using L. corniculatus to finish weaned lambs without anthelmintic drenches for a seven-week period is proposed. 4. A three-year study (Chapter 5; November 2000 to October 2003) was conducted to compare, under grazing conditions, seasonal and annual grazed net herbage accumulation rate and seasonal dynamics of undisturbed (i. e. non-grazed) net herbage accumulation rate of L. corniculatus relative to grass-dominant pasture. Prediction equations to estimate standing DM in L. corniculatus and pasture from the rising plate meter (RPM) and sward surface height were also generated. L. corniculatus and pasture growing in a moderate fertility and low-pH soil (pH 5. 35) accumulated similar total herbage masses (24. 3 vs. 24. 1 t DM/ha) over the 3 -year period, with the DM production being greater for L. corniculatus than for pasture during 2000 - 2001, producing more DM during summer/autumn drought conditions. The net herbage accumulation rate from undisturbed areas of L. corniculatus and pasture were similar in spring, summer and autumn. Seasonal variation in the calibration regressions fitted to estimate herbage mass of L. corniculatus non-destructively, suggested a combination of destructive and nondestructive methods are needed to assess herbage mass. It was concluded that L. corniculatus has the potential to increase the performance of a pasture-based sheep dryland farming system due to its ability to grow in acidic soils, its tolerance of drought conditions during summer/autumn and its seasonality of feed supply. 5. Three digestion experiments involving cryptorchid weaned lambs were conducted for 14 days over the spring, summer and autumn to determine changes in in vivo digestibility of DM, OM, digestible OM in the DM and ME concentration of L. corniculatus at different stages of maturity. In vivo digestibility samples were then used as standards to investigate if the enzymatic in vitro system of Roughan and Holland (1977) could predict OMD and DOMD of CT-containing L. corniculatus. Digestibility of L. corniculatus declined as it matured, but the rate of decline was much less than occurs for temperate grasses and for white clover. It was concluded that the in vitro enzymatic system of Roughan and Holland (1977) can be used to predict OMD and DOMD of L. corniculatus, provided a standard curve involving in vivo data generated with L. corniculatus is used. Using a standard curve with in vivo data from pasture led to bias which increased at lower OMD values. Reasons for the consistent differences between L. corniculatus and pasture standard curves are discussed, including possible effects of residual bound CT in lowering in vitro digestibility. From this series of experiments, this study is the first to report that relative to conventional perennial ryegrass/white clover, mating ewes on L. corniculatus under grazing conditions may reduce post-natal lamb mortality. It is also the first study to show that grazing sheep on L. corniculatus can maintain productivity during spring and summer with reduced dependence on anthelmintic drench input. It is concluded that whole farm modelling, mechanical harvesting and conservation strategies, selection of L. corniculatus germplasm for creeping-type plants more suited to grazing and the integration of new crops containing secondary compounds, such as chicory, should be considered to support major advances in sustainable dryland sheep farming systems...|$|R
