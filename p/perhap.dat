40|$|Despite {{improvements}} in anticancer-targeted therapies, {{there are still}} lim-ited options for patients that develop metastatic disease in organs such as the bone. Metastasis is a complex process ini-tiated by tumor cell invasion of the sur-rounding stroma, intravasation into the circulation, extravasation and lodging in distant organs. At distant sites, tumor cells overcome dormancy and induce angiogen-esis before they eventually invade the tissue and outgrow into macrometastases. This multistep process is dynamic, involving interactions between tumor cells and other host cells, including immune cells. 1 <b>Perhap...</b>|$|E

40|$|Twenty {{years ago}} it was {{discovered}} that recognition of semantically unexpected words is associated with a special ERP signature – the N 400. Pinpointing the precise functional significance of the N 400 has, however, been difficult. Recent MEG studies of word processing reveal that, in fact, the N 400 decomposes into several functionally distinct subcomponents, allowing for more fine-grained investigation of its significance. What happens in the brain when we recognize words? Within a few hundred milliseconds, we are able to perceive a string of sounds or letters and map the string to a single word representation among tens of thousands in our mental lexicon.

40|$|T he {{debate about}} the {{advantages}} of fibrinolytic therapy orprimary percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PCI) as a superior reperfusion strategy for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has continued for 30 years. In the first decade, primary PCI was limited by first-generation equip-ment, inadequate radiographic imaging systems, suboptimal adjunctive antithrombotic therapy, and delays in time-to-treatment. Successful reperfusion rates were too low and infarct artery reocclusion and restenosis rates were too high, so fibrinolytic therapy was associated with better clinical outcomes. 1 Since then, fibrinolytic therapy improvements have included bolus administration of newer agents, adjunc-tive dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, and cardiac catheterization {{as soon as possible}} for reperfusion failure and within 24 hours after successful reperfusion to maximize sustained infarct artery patency rates. 2 <b>Perhap...</b>|$|E
