5|$|Balzac {{concerned}} himself overwhelmingly {{with the}} darker essence {{of human nature}} and the corrupting influence of middle and high societies. His mission was to observe humankind in its most representative state, frequently wandering through the streets incognito among the masses of Parisian society to undertake his research. He used incidents from his life and the <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> in works like Eugénie Grandet and Louis Lambert.|$|E
5|$|As The World Ends with You {{focuses on}} the {{character}} of Neku Sakuraba, {{in order to create a}} believable story the developers put a lot of focus on his development, such as how he would feel, what thoughts lie behind his actions, how he interacted with other characters, and how the <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> feel about him. The developers included aspects and daily concerns, hoping that they could be things that players would have to deal with their personal lives and therefore would let them relate with Neku.|$|E
5|$|Maher showcased his vocal talent from {{an early}} age, imitating celebrities and <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> An actor {{with a passion for}} the theatre, he has starred in more than 30 {{international}} stage plays, with an extensive portion of his work dedicated to children and their development. Maher also wrote most of the songs performed in these plays. Maher has also starred in a number of TV series across the region.|$|E
60|$|And {{this is how}} {{it happens}} that Grandfather Frog told this story to the little meadow and forest <b>people</b> {{gathered}} <b>around</b> <b>him</b> {{on the bank of the}} Smiling Pool.|$|R
50|$|As {{her husband}} was walking to the City Hall with <b>people</b> {{crowding}} <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> {{he was shot in}} the head by an operative of the opposition. She was left to raise her own five children and also her adopted children, on her own.|$|R
60|$|The <b>people</b> crowded <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> {{demanding}} {{the tale of}} his adventures, and their surprise was only equaled by their horror when they learned he had been captured by a band of monkeys, and shut up in a cage because he {{was thought to be}} a dangerous wild beast.|$|R
5|$|Representations of the city, countryside, and {{building}} interiors {{are essential to}} Balzac's realism, often serving to paint a naturalistic backdrop before which the characters' lives follow a particular course; this gave him a reputation as an early naturalist. Intricate details about locations sometimes stretch for fifteen or twenty pages. As he did with the <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> Balzac studied these places in depth, traveling to remote locations and comparing notes {{that he had made}} on previous visits.|$|E
5|$|As a hermit, Withers {{lives in}} solitude. He does not own {{a car or}} television; he gets his news from the <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and gets around on a bicycle that he found, broken, {{on the side of}} the road. Though he has an open-door policy for people that come to visit him, he himself visits family only twice a year. He does have a computer, which he uses to keep in touch with other hermits via email. To earn his food and {{clothing}} allowance, which amounts to less than $5,500 per year, Withers makes pottery to sell and works one day a week for a scientific-instrument company. At the end of each year, he donates any funds that remain to charity.|$|E
5|$|An away team boards the cube, {{discovering}} that either {{an accident or}} another species disabled the vessel. They take a Borg drone back onto Voyager, where the Doctor (Robert Picardo) accidentally revives it. After being told by Frazier to remain where he is, Chakotay breaks {{out of his room}} where he sees that all the <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> on the alien planet possess Borg implant technology in their bodies. Frazier explains that an electro-kinetic storm broke their link with the Borg hive mind. Instead, the separated drones settled on a nearby planet. Chakotay's health gets worse, and the ex-Borg offer to connect him to a joint mind to heal his injuries, and he reluctantly accepts. Once part of the hive mind, he sees a montage of their memories. After Voyager arrives, Frazier and her group want Janeway to re-activate the neuroelectric generator on the damaged cube to extend a new joint mind across the entire planet.|$|E
50|$|He is {{the main}} protagonist, who is {{a high school student}} that has to deal with the wacky <b>people</b> living <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> much to his chagrin. His father is a former salary man who found himself drafted into Krakozhia Dukedom armed forces, due to the {{clerical}} error on his part.|$|R
60|$|The last chords died away, {{the fire}} faded {{out of the}} jade-coloured eyes, and Ronnie became once more a well-groomed youth in a drawing-room full of well-dressed <b>people.</b> But <b>around</b> <b>him</b> rose an {{explosive}} clamour of applause and congratulation, the sincere tribute of appreciation and the equally hearty expression of imitative homage.|$|R
50|$|He narrated about 1,547 Hadiths (some historians say). After {{the death}} of Muhammad he used to deliver lectures in Masjid Nabwi, Medina, Egypt, and Damascus. Such leading Tabi'en {{scholars}} as Amr ibn Dinar, Mujahid, and Ata' ibn Abi Rabah attended his lectures. <b>People</b> gathered <b>around</b> <b>him</b> in Damascus and Egypt to learn about Muhammad and his Hadiths.|$|R
5|$|Neither {{had much}} money, so they {{determined}} to fund themselves by collecting and selling fine specimens {{of birds and}} insects. Both made extensive travels — {{in different parts of}} the Amazon basin — creating large natural history collections, especially of insects. Wallace sailed back to England in 1852 after four years; on the voyage, his ship caught fire, and his collection was destroyed; undeterred, he set out again, leading eventually (1869) to a comparable book, The Malay Archipelago. By the time he came home in November 1859, Bates had collected over 14,000 species, of which 8,000 were new to science. His observations of the coloration of butterflies led him to describe what is now called Batesian mimicry, where an edible species protects itself by appearing like a distasteful species. Bates's account of his stay, including observations of nature and the <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> occupies his book.|$|E
5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins to look as if it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get a second job and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with the <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> who, in trying to help him, make him feel worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is the very real possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{most of the}} films {{directed}} by Warhol were pulled out of circulation by Warhol and the <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> who ran his business. After Warhol's death, the films were slowly restored by the Whitney Museum and are occasionally projected at museums and film festivals. Few of the Warhol-directed films are available on video or DVD.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, the World Day of the Sick had {{a special}} {{significance}} since {{it was the year}} John Paul died from a sepsis. Many <b>people</b> had gathered <b>around</b> <b>him</b> as he lay dying.|$|R
50|$|After Stefan (Paul Wesley) {{lost his}} memory, Damon (Ian Somerhalder) {{tries to help}} him {{remember}}. He remembers the date and where he is, but he cannot remember who he is, who the <b>people</b> are <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> or even {{that he is a}} vampire. Damon presents Stefan with his diaries to jog his memory with, but he still has no recollection of his past.|$|R

25|$|A 45-year-old {{editor of}} a {{publishing}} company. He lives his daily life on his own schedule, seemingly oblivious to the rhythms of <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> and often calls Tengo {{in the middle of}} the night. Although Komatsu enjoys a good professional reputation for his competence, he is not seen to be an amicable person. Little is known about his private life beyond rumors.|$|E
25|$|Sun was a {{complicated}} man - it cannot only be big music, {{it must also}} be sensitive music....I don’t worry about what is 'Chinese' or 'Western'. I was raised with both musical traditions, with operas from both cultures. I can write what comes naturally; what I feel gives a sense of Sun as a person, and the feelings of the <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dick Su as Seng: Dick Su was {{involved}} in the production only after Serene Chen brought him in. In the film, Seng is the son in the family, who failed in graduating from his overseas studies. There were times when he tries to convince his family, especially his father, that he can succeed in life. Unfortunately, his plans never seem to work out and he ends up disappointing the <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Henry Gowen is a cold, cynical man who {{formerly}} {{owned the}} coal mine. After the mine was shut down, Henry became {{the mayor of}} Hope Valley and still creates a cold, cynical presence whenever <b>people</b> are <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> Henry is highly disliked and feared in the town. He frequently uses bribery {{to get what he}} wants, which is never {{for the good of the}} town.|$|R

He, then, enacted the symbolic marriage with the 'seven virgins'.|$|R
25|$|As they {{proceeded}} {{into and}} through Nebraska, Bierstadt would continuously sketch the land, weather, animals, and <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> During this time, their party passed a fifty-wagon train of German emigrants who were headed to Oregon. This event most likely inspired several {{paintings of the}} Oregon Trail, including Emigrants Crossing the Plains and The Oregon Trail. It was also during this trip through Nebraska that Bierstadt produced a series of sketches titled The Last of the Buffalo, which were possibly referenced later on for his 1888 painting of the same name.|$|E
25|$|The Hadith are {{reported}} sayings of Muhammad and <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> The Hadith containing Jesus legend {{have been influenced}} by the non-canonical ('heretical') Christianity that prevailed in the Arab peninsula and further in Abyssinia. The Hadith developed a canonical status in the third Muslim century as a source of authority for the Muslim community. The Muslim perception of Jesus emerging from the Hadith is of a miraculous, sinless, and eschatological figure, pointing people, again according to the Muslim's perspective of prophethood, to the Muslim faith (Muslim; one who submits to the will of God).|$|E
25|$|One day, three {{children}} {{who claimed that}} Seigi is their father suddenly appears. Two of them are siblings whose mother had recently died, while the other is left at home alone because her mother frequently runs away with her boyfriends.

But he continues {{to search for the}} person who caused it, despite being discouraged by <b>people</b> all <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> and collects evidence one by one at a slow pace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm glad of it," [...] said Mary Louise. [...] "I've often wondered, Lory, {{how your}} father {{could be so}} {{infatuated}} with novel-reading, absorbing stories of human interest, {{if they have any}} interest at all, with such avidity, while the real <b>people</b> all <b>around</b> <b>him</b> failed to interest him at all. I have thought perhaps he read to keep his mind from--from other things that it would make him unhappy to dwell upon." ...|$|R
50|$|By 1958, Elder Sophrony had six <b>people</b> living <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> {{seeking the}} monastic life. Realising {{that such a}} {{situation}} could not continue, he went to Tolleshunt Knights, near Maldon, Essex, England to inspect a property; {{in the spring of}} 1959, the new Community of St John the Baptist was formed at the same property, under Metropolitan Anthony's omophorion. The monastery, from its beginnings, had both monks and nuns, due to Elder Sophrony being unable to oversee two separate communities.|$|R

Jacob {{develops}} a guarded relationship with August and his wife, Marlena, with whom Jacob falls in love. August is suspicious of their relationship and beats Marlena and Jacob. Marlena subsequently leaves August and stays at a hotel while she is not performing. Uncle Al then informs Jacob that August is a paranoid schizophrenic and utters a threat: reunite August and Marlena as a happily married couple or Walter and Camel get red-lighted.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} period, Jobs and Brennan both became {{practitioners}} of Zen Buddhism through the Zen master Kōbun Chino Otogawa. Jobs {{was living with}} his parents again, in their backyard toolshed which he had converted into a bedroom with a sleeping bag, mat, books, a candle, and a meditation pillow. Jobs engaged in lengthy meditation retreats at the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, the oldest Sōtō Zen monastery in the US. He considered taking up monastic residence at Eihei-ji in Japan, and maintained a lifelong appreciation for Zen. Jobs would later say that <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> who did not share his countercultural roots could not fully relate to his thinking.|$|E
25|$|Troughton {{played the}} role {{generally}} in a more lightweight, comical manner, albeit still {{with much of the}} original character's passionate hatred of evil and desire to help the oppressed. He also on occasion showed a darker side, manipulating his companions and the <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> for the greater good (examples include The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Evil of the Daleks). Davis left the show {{at the end of the}} fourth season, and was replaced by Peter Bryant. A few months later, Lloyd left the show and Bryant was promoted to producer. Bryant's successor as script editor was Derrick Sherwin (though Victor Pemberton had filled the job for Bryant's first serial, The Tomb of the Cybermen).|$|E

In a joint effort they helped with the reconstruction of the burial site of Sari Saltuk (also known as Baba Sari Saltik or Saltuk Baba), a 13th-century saint.|$|R
50|$|The year 2002 was {{probably}} the darkest year for Bustamante, especially considering his experience at the World Pool Championships. While the tournament was still going on, Bustamante was most shocked when he {{received a phone call}} from his wife informing him that his daughter, who was less than a year old, had died. Devastated by this, Bustamante strongly considered forfeiting his contention at the tournament to return to the Philippines but some <b>people</b> <b>around</b> convinced <b>him</b> to go on.|$|R
5000|$|According to Henry E. Beck's book Growin' Up With Men And Machines, Ken is {{described}} as a [...] "soft spoken man with a hand like a catcher's mitt".
