25|$|The camera (or 'camera obscura') is a {{dark room}} or chamber from which, as far as possible, all light is {{excluded}} except the light that forms the image. It was discovered and used in the 16th century by painters. The subject being photographed, however, must be illuminated. Cameras can range from small to very large, a whole room that is kept dark while the object to be photographed is in another room where it is properly illuminated. This was common for reproduction photography of flat copy when large film negatives were used (see <b>Process</b> <b>camera).</b>|$|E

50|$|A <b>process</b> <b>camera</b> is a {{specialised}} form {{of camera}} used for mass reproduction of graphic materials. The original document was photographed and the negatives (or positive films)produced {{were used to}} produce printing plates or other graphic media - usually via some kind of process where the negative was put in intimate contact with a printing plate in a vacuum frame(the printing plate having a U.V light-sensitive coating) and exposed to U.V. light.

50|$|Joan Elizabeth Manning {{was born}} in Sidney, British Columbia, on 11 December 1923.She spent her early {{childhood}} on Vancouver Island, then moved to Amherstburg, Ontario.She studied at the Ontario College of Art in Toronto and graduated in 1945.She married, and became known as Jo Rothfels.She returned to the OCA in 1960 to study printmaking as a special student.She took up etching in 1962. After a divorce in 1971 she reverted to her maiden name.In 1971 she studied <b>process</b> <b>camera</b> techniques and color separation at George Brown College, Toronto.|$|E
50|$|Process {{cameras were}} still widely in use {{until the late}} 1980s and early 1990s. At that time, {{computer-to-plate}} technology became economically viable and had significant advantages over the analogue process cameras. There {{was no need for}} staff to operate the cameras or expose the negatives and this also meant that the chemicals and film and subsequent expense required for traditional methods were no longer necessary. In some industries, large production areas were replaced by one relatively compact machine - this also having {{a significant impact on the}} buildings used for graphic reproduction. As a result, the <b>process</b> <b>camera</b> has become obsolete very quickly indeed and very few remain in use.|$|E
5000|$|He invented several {{techniques}} {{related to}} halftone blockmaking, {{of which the}} [...] "screen-adjusting machine" [...] for the automatic focussing of <b>process</b> <b>cameras,</b> was also assembled in England following his design. The British handbook of printing technology, the Penrose Annual, Volume X, 1904-05, mentioned about him in an editorial note that, [...] "Mr. Ray is evidently possessed of a mathematical quality of mind and he has reasoned out for himself the problems of half-tone work in a remarkably successful manner ... (His printing developments) enable the operator to do uniform work with the fullest graduation and detail in it and with the minimum amount of manipulative skill in the negative-making and etching." [...] The Penrose Annual Volume XI of 1905-06 published his paper about the new technique of 60-degree screens in halftone blockmaking.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a preliminary conceptual investigation into an environment representation that has constant space complexity {{with respect to}} the camera image space. This type of representation allows the planning algorithms of a mobile agent to bypass what are often complex and noisy transformations between camera image space and Euclidean space. The approach is to compute per-pixel potential values directly from <b>processed</b> <b>camera</b> data, which results in a discrete potential field that has constant space complexity {{with respect to the}} image plane. This can enable planning and control algorithms, whose complexity often depends {{on the size of the}} environment representation, to be defined with constant run-time. This type of approach can be particularly useful for platforms with strict resource constraints, such as embedded and real-time systems.

50|$|The technique, if {{used with}} a camera not {{specially}} designed for contact printing, {{runs the risk of}} jamming the camera, due to the double thickness of film in the gate, and damaging both the exposed and unexposed stock. On the other hand, because both strips of film are in contact and are handled by the same film transport mechanism at the same time, registration is kept very precise. Special cameras designed for the process were manufactured by Acme and Oxberry, amongst others, and these usually featured an extremely precise registration mechanism specially designed for the <b>process.</b> These <b>process</b> <b>cameras</b> are usually recognisable by their special film magazines, which look like two standard film magazines on top of each other. The magazines allow the separate loading of exposed and unexposed stock, as opposed to winding the two films onto the same reel.|$|R
50|$|The early 20th century saw the {{development}} of photozincography, which allowed maps to be split into layers, for example one layer for vegetation and another for water. This was particularly used for printing contours - drawing these was a labour-intensive task but having them on a separate layer meant they could be worked on without the other layers to confuse the draughtsman. This work was originally drawn on glass plates but later plastic film was introduced, with the advantages of being lighter, using less storage space and being less brittle, among others. When all the layers were finished, they were combined into one image using a large <b>process</b> <b>camera.</b> Once color printing came in, the layers idea was also used for creating separate printing plates for each color. While the use of layers much later {{became one of the}} main typical features of a contemporary GIS, the photographic process just described is not considered to be a GIS in itself - as the maps were just images with no database to link them to.|$|E
50|$|That {{innovation}} {{came about}} {{as a result of}} research conducted by CMX, a joint venture of the CBS and Memorex corporations. The intent was to create a much less haphazard method of editing video directly that had all of the creative control of traditional film editing. The result, the CMX 600, accomplished this goal with a two part <b>process.</b> <b>Camera</b> master tapes were dubbed as black and white analog video to very large computer memory discs. The editor could access any shot exactly, and quickly edit a precise black and white, low quality version of the program. More importantly, re-editing was trivial, as no cuts were actually performed. The shots were simply accessed and played in sequence from the disc in real time. The computer kept track of all the numbers in this offline stage of the process, and when the editor was satisfied, output them as an Edit decision list (EDL). This EDL was used in the final stage of the process, the online edit. To make it work, special computer to video tape recorder (VTR) edit interfaces had to be developed, called I-Squareds. Under the control of a computer reading back the EDL and communications protocols, these I-Squareds took control and shuttled the broadcast quality VTRs exactly to the points necessary to record and edit master with exact edits from the source tapes.|$|E
5000|$|U. Ray and Sons was {{primarily}} {{set up as}} an initiative to remedy the lack of good quality printing of illustrations in Calcutta {{in spite of the}} existence of advanced printing presses in the early 1890s. Upendrakishore, a versatile genius, excelling in the fields of children’s literature, music, painting and printing technology could not therefore have first grade illustrations published for his Children’s Ramayan. A lack of skill in graphic arts and photo-processes resulted in ruined print illustrations. ‘At that time, only a few local firms like Thacker and Spincks (of Thacker's Indian Directory) took commercial orders for halftone blocks but they were very costly. Being of an inventive and mechanical turn of mind, Upendrakishore ordered the necessary equipment from A.W. Penrose & Co., of 109 Farringdon Street, London, and began to study the technical nature of the subject. These studies led him to investigate the theoretical basis of the <b>process</b> <b>camera</b> and arrive at conclusions which standardises the hitherto empirical practices at process work.’ [...] ‘A camera and various pieces of half-tone equipment arrived from Britain … bybullock cart; soon after that, they moved out of 13 Cornwallis Street to a house not far away which Upendrakisore had made into a studio. The money for this came from selling most of his share in the zamindari at his ancestral home in Mymensingh to his foster brother Narendrakisore, {{who was in charge of}} it following his father Harikisore’s death,’ records Andrew Robinson ...|$|E

5000|$|Experimentations began {{immediately}} and the firm’s reputation was aided by its owners contribution to his chosen field. Starting in 1897, Upendrakishore wrote {{a number of}} articles in the best-known British printing journal of the time, Penrose Annual, based on his researches. Their titles, though technical, are self-explanatory: ‘Focussing the Screen’ (1897), ‘The Theory of the Half-Tone Dot’ (1898),‘The Half-Tone Theory Graphically Explained’ (1899), ‘Automatic Adjustment of the Half-Tone Screen’ (1901), ‘Diffraction in Half-Tone’ (1902-3), ‘More About the Half-Tone Theory’ (1903-4), ‘The 60° Cross-Line Screen’ (1905-6), ‘Multiple Stops’ (1911-12). Upendrakishore’s papers about the diaphragm systems, his invention of the sixty-degree screen, his original methods of colour reproduction, his studies in diffraction and his contributions towards standardising half-tone camera work were all intimately connected with {{the progress of the}} photographic method of reproducing illustrations. While Siddhartha Ghosh [...] in his essay on Sukumar Ray’s Abol Tabol tells us that Upendrakishore patented a gadget known as the ‘automatic screen adjustment indicator’ which was sold as an optional accessory to the Penrose company’s <b>process</b> <b>camera,</b> Andrew Robinson quotes a Penrose Annual issue in which its London editor explains a lack of articles by Mr. U. Ray as an outcome of ill health and further informs the printing trade that U. Ray had anticipated by some years the important screen just patented by someone in Britain’ and that ‘unable to prove his theory in Calcutta for lack of resources, Upendrakisore had appealed to his colleagues in Britain for help and one of them had plagiarised his ideas.|$|E
5000|$|A {{new chapter}} {{in the history of}} the firm began in 1913 when the family {{residence}} as well as the workshop and office of the firm were constructed at 100 Garpar Road according to Upendrakishore’s design. This promoted the status of the firm from printers to publishers as well, with the printing of the first Sandesh. Much information can be got from grandson Satyajit Ray’s recollections of this new press as recorded in Andrew Robinson’s The Inner Eye. ‘Satyajit Ray’s main memories of those earliest years revolved around his grandfather’s house-cum-press, U. Ray and Sons at 100 Garpar Road, and the relatives who occupied it. It stood in a peaceful road in north Calcutta with a deaf-and-dumb school on one side and a private school on the other which was no doubt typical of the crammers that Rabindranath Tagore tells us he spent his childhood years trying to escape in the 1860s and 70s. In the heat of midday, when Calcutta traffic of all kinds came to a stop, Satyajit would hear the chant of multiplication tables, of reading out loud and, sometimes, the shouts of angry masters. The building had three storeys and a fine flat roof, which Upendrakishore had used for his astronomy. The printing machinery was housed at the front of the building on the ground floor and directly above that were the block-making and typesetting rooms. The Ray family lived at the back on all three floors. To reach them, a visitor entered a small lane to one side of the house. A door gave on to stairs to the right which led to the family apartments; those turning left were on press business. Satyajit was fascinated from the beginning by the whole paraphernalia of printing, particularly as one of its end products was Sandesh with its three-colour cover. He became a frequent visitor to the first floor. As he entered, the compositors, sitting side by side in front of their multisectioned Type cases, would glance up at him and smile. He would make his way past them to the back of the room - to the block-making section with its enormous imported <b>process</b> <b>camera,</b> and its distinctive smells. ‘Even today,’ wrote Ray in 1981, ‘if I catch a whiff of turpentine, a picture of U. Ray and Sons’ block-making department floats before my eyes.’ The main operator of the camera, Ramdohin, was his friend. He had had no formal education; Upendrakisore had trained him from scratch and he was like one of the family. Presenting Ramdohin with a piece of paper with some squiggles on it, Satyajit would announce: ‘This is for Sandesh.’ Ramdohin would solemnly wag his head in agreement, ‘Of course, Khoka Babu, of course’ and lift Satyajit up to show him the upside-down image of his drawing in the screen of the camera. But somehow it would never appear in Sandesh.’ ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Camera {{networks}} are complex vision systems {{difficult to control}} {{if the number of}} sensors is getting higher. With classic approaches, each camera has to be calibrated and synchronized individually. These tasks are often troublesome because of spatial constraints, and mostly due to the amount of information that need to be <b>processed.</b> <b>Cameras</b> generally observe overlapping areas, leading to redundant information that are then acquired, transmitted, stored and then processed. We propose in this paper a method to segment, cluster and codify images acquired by cameras of a network. The images are decomposed sequentially into layers where redundant information are discarded. Without need of any calibration operation, each sensor contributes to build a global representation of the entire network environment. The information sent by the network is then represented by a reduced and compact amount of data using a codification process. This framework allows structures to be retrieved and also the topology of the network. It can also provide the localization and trajectories of mobile objects. Experiments will present practical results {{in the case of a}} network containing 20 cameras observing a common scene. ...|$|R
