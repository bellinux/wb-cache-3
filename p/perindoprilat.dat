40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to investigate the mechanism underlying the endothelium-dependent relaxations to <b>perindoprilat,</b> a converting enzyme inhibitor, in canine coronary arteries previously exposed to bradykinin. Rings suspended in organ chambers were exposed to bradykinin for 3 min and washed extensively for 150 min. In rings previously exposed to the peptide, bradykinin induced relaxations which were augmented {{in the presence of}} perindoprilat; this response was not affected by indomethacin, but nitro-L-arginine induced a rightward shift of the relaxation to the peptide without affecting its maximal effect. In canine coronary arteries previously exposed to the peptide, <b>perindoprilat</b> caused endothelium-dependent relaxations (IC 50 = 7. 83), which had been observed previously at concentrations where the converting enzyme inhibitor did not augment the response to bradykinin. Carboxypeptidase B 2 but not aprotinin, impaired the relaxation to <b>perindoprilat,</b> suggesting a contribution of bradykinin. The relaxation to <b>perindoprilat</b> was not affected by the B 2 antagonist Leu 8 -des-Arg 9 -bradykinin. However, the bradykinin B 2 antagonist HOE- 140 displayed a noncompetitive antagonism against the response to <b>perindoprilat.</b> The response to the converting enzyme inhibitor was not affected by indomethacin but was impaired significantly by nitro-L-arginine. The present findings suggest that in canine coronary arteries previously exposed to bradykinin, the relaxation to <b>perindoprilat</b> is mediated mainly by endothelium-derived nitric oxide. In addition, the response to <b>perindoprilat</b> may be due to factors other than just protection of bound bradykinin from degradation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

We compared intravenously administered ACE inhibitors, <b>perindoprilat</b> and enalaprilat, for myocardial drug uptake and effects on angiotensin and bradykinin peptides versus hemodynamic effects in 25 patients with stable angina and well-preserved left ventricular systolic function. Myocardial uptake was rapid and more efficient for <b>perindoprilat</b> than for enalaprilat (peak content at 263 and 304 seconds, 0. 580. 12 % and 0. 270. 07 % of the administered dose for <b>perindoprilat</b> and enalaprilat, respectively, P 0. 04 for difference).

40|$|Role of the {{renin-angiotensin system}} on the renal {{functional}} reserve in renal transplant recipients. To determine the renal functional reserve in renal transplant recipients, we measured the glomerular filtration rate by inulin clearance and the renal plasma flow by PAH clearance before and during an amino acid infusion (Totamine, 6 to 8 mg/kg/min for 90 to 120 min) in 18 transplanted patients with stable renal function. To test {{the role of the}} renin-angiotensin {{system on the}} renal functional reserve, we performed a crossover placebo-controlled randomized trial of acute blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by injection of <b>perindoprilat</b> (2 mg i. v.), an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme before amino acid infusion, each patient being studied twice at seven day intervals. Amino acid infusion induced a time-dependent increase in the glomerular filtration rate (P = 0. 04), whether or not the renin-angiotensin system was blocked. Maximal increases were from 49. 1 ± 4. 1 to 58. 9 ± 5. 4, mean ± SE (18. 5 %), in control conditions and from 52. 4 ± 5. 6 to 62. 1 ± 5. 5 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 (19. 7 %) after <b>perindoprilat.</b> The increase in glomerular filtration rate was less pronounced in patients taking cyclosporin A than in patients treated with steroid and azathioprine. Amino acid infusion also induced a significant and time-dependent increase (15. 2 to 20. 2 %) in the renal plasma flow (P < 0. 01) whether or not <b>perindoprilat</b> had been given. Furthermore, <b>perindoprilat</b> alone increased renal plasma flow by 13. 6 %, and this effect seemed additive with that of amino acids. <b>Perindoprilat</b> injection decreased filtration fraction (from 0. 20 ± 0. 01 to 0. 19 ± 0. 01). This parameter returned to basal values after amino acid infusion (0. 20 ± 0. 01). Amino acid infusion decreased renal vascular resistances as did <b>perindoprilat</b> alone.

Rings of either canine femoral, basilar or left anterior descending coronary arteries, pulmonary veins, or thoracic aortas from normotensive and hypertensive rats were suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension measurement. <b>Perindoprilat</b> did not evoke endothelium-dependent or -independent relaxations of femoral arteries, basilar arteries, coronary arteries, or rat aortas. The compound did not affect the endothelium-independent relaxations induced by isoproterenol and nitroglycerin in canine femoral arteries. However, when given to rings of canine basilar and coronary arteries, increasing concentrations of <b>perindoprilat</b> potentiated the endothelium-dependent relaxations to bradykinin. In addition, the drug potentiated the endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine and thrombin in preparations of canine left anterior descending coronary arteries. In contrast, <b>perindoprilat</b> did not cause changes in tension when given in the presence of either adenosine diphosphate, serotonin, or arginine-vasopressin. The compound did not modify the endothelium-dependent contractions evoked by the calcium ionophore A 23187 and acetylcholine in canine basilar arteries. It also did not alter endothelium-dependent contractions to arachidonic acid or to hypoxia in canine pulmonary veins or to acetylcholine in the aorta of the spontaneously hypertensive rat. These experiments suggest that <b>perindoprilat</b> (a) does not release endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) from the endothelial cells, (b) does not interfere with the ability of the endothelium to release endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s), (c) may affect the endothelium-dependent responses to bradykinin by direct interaction with converting enzyme, (d) does not affect endothelium-dependent relaxations induced by acetylcholine and thrombin by an unknown mechanism. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Perindopril is a non-sulphydryl {{angiotensin}} converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor which requires hydrolysis to its active metabolite, <b>perindoprilat,</b> to produce its effects. Ten cirrhotic patients with mild to severe disease were studied after oral administration of a single 8 mg dose of perindopril as its tert-butylamine salt. Compared with a historical control group of young healthy volunteers receiving the same single oral dose of perindopril, mean AUC values of the prodrug perindopril were double in patients with liver cirrhosis (602 +/- 294 s. d. ng ml- 1 h vs 266 +/- 70 s. d. ng ml- 1 h) whereas the mean AUC of <b>perindoprilat</b> {{was found to be}} similar (134 +/- 139 ng ml- 1 h vs 120 +/- 29 ng ml- 1 h).

40|$|The role of {{bradykinin}} in the antifibrotic {{actions of}} <b>perindoprilat</b> on human mesangial cells. BackgroundAngiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) {{protect against the}} development of glomerulosclerosis using mechanisms partly dissociated from their systemic antihypertensive action. The aim {{of the current study}} was to delineate the mechanism of action underlying the antifibrotic effects of the ACE-I <b>perindoprilat</b> in the context of macrophage-mediated scarring in human mesangial cells. MethodsMesangial cells were treated with macrophage-conditioned medium (MPCM) in {{the presence or absence of}} the ACE-I <b>perindoprilat.</b> ResultsForty μmol/L <b>perindoprilat</b> reduced MPCM-induced mesangial cell fibronectin levels by 19. 4 ± 0. 6 % (P < 0. 001). Immunoprecipitation of 35 S-methionine biosynthetically labeled fibronectin and Northern analysis suggested that the decrease in fibronectin levels was not caused by reduced synthesis. MPCM stimulated the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 2, 3, and 9 in mesangial cells; however, these were not significantly altered by ACE-I treatment, and neither was production of their tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP- 1). Addition of exogenous bradykinin to MPCM-treated mesangial cells resulted in a 22. 5 ± 1. 4 % (P < 0. 02) reduction in secreted fibronectin levels, while semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Southern blotting demonstrated that bradykinin B 2 receptor expression was up regulated by 71 ± 30 % in MPCM-stimulated mesangial cells in response to ACE-I treatment (P = 0. 032). Moreover, the bradykinin B 2 receptor antagonist HOE 140 attenuated the beneficial effects of <b>perindoprilat.</b> MPCM-stimulated mesangial cell protein expression levels of plasminogen activator system components tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) were altered after treatment with ACE-I.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] Comparison of {{the first}} dose {{responses}} to low dose constant rate infusions of diacid angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. DESIGN [...] Double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, parallel group prospective study. SETTING [...] General hospital inpatient admissions for supervised diuretic withdrawal (24 - 48 hours) {{and the introduction of}} ACE inhibitor treatment. PATIENTS [...] 36 unselected elderly (aged 60 - 87 years) patients with symptomatic but stable chronic cardiac failure (New York Heart Association grades II-IV). ACE inhibitor started under double blind conditions with blood pressure monitoring. INTERVENTION [...] Patients were randomly allocated to receive intravenous placebo (saline), enalaprilat (1. 5 mg over six hours) or <b>perindoprilat</b> (1 mg over six hours) by constant rate intravenous infusion (5 ml/hour). The protocol allowed for discontinuation of infusion if mean arterial blood pressure fell by 30 % from the value before treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Blood pressure and heart rate responses, drug concentration, plasma renin, and ACE activities. RESULTS [...] The three groups had similar age, severity of heart failure, diuretic dose before treatment, plasma renin activity, and serum electrolyte state. All patients remained symptom free throughout the study. Infusions were only ended early with active treatment: 5 / 12 <b>perindoprilat</b> cases, (mean (SD) dose 0. 88 (0. 18) mg, and 5 / 12 enalaprilat cases (mean (SD) dose 1. 2 (0. 4) mg.

40|$|The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has two natural {{substrates}} and two catalytic domains: one cleaving angiotensin I and one inactivating bradykinin. The aim of {{this study}} was to investigate the comparative binding affinity of ACE inhibitors for the two binding sites of human endothelial ACE. In vitro binding assays were performed to test the ability of bradykinin, angiotensin I, or various ACE inhibitors (enalaprilat, <b>perindoprilat,</b> quinaprilat, ramiprilat, and trandolaprilat) to displace a saturating concentration of [(125) I] 351 A, a radiolabeled lisinopril analogue, from ACE binding sites. The calculated IC(50) values for the ACE inhibitors were in the nanomolar range, while those for the natural substrates were in the micromolar range. The bradykinin/angiotensin I selectivity ratios calculated from double displacement experiments were: <b>perindoprilat,</b> 1. 44; ramiprilat, 1. 16; quinaprilat, 1. 09; trandolaprilat, 1. 08; enalaprilat, 1. 00. The ACE inhibitors generally had higher affinity for the bradykinin than the angiotensin I binding sites, supporting the idea that these agents are primarily inhibitors of bradykinin degradation, and secondarily inhibitors of angiotensin II production. <b>Perindoprilat</b> had the highest selectivity for bradykinin versus angiotensin I binding sites, and enalaprilat has the lowest.

40|$|Inhibitors of {{angiotensin}} converting-enzyme (ACE) {{enhance the}} endothelium-dependent relaxation to bradykinin and cause {{the accumulation of}} kinins in the vascular wall. Bradykinin elicits the production of vasodilator prostanoids and nitric oxide by endothelial cells. However, there is an additional component to the dilator actions of bradykinin, which is mediated by a diffusible endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). The knowledge gathered {{on the nature of}} EDHF and its mechanism of action are reviewed briefly. EDHF causes hyperpolarization and relaxation of arterial smooth muscle by activating K+-channel, the nature of which varies between species. During the inhibition of both cyclooxygenase and nitric oxide synthase, concentration-response relationships of the hyperpolarization and relaxation elicited by bradykinin overlap in canine coronary arteries. Both effects are enhanced equally by the ACE inhibitor <b>perindoprilat.</b> They are inhibited by membrane depolarization that is obtained by raising the extracellular concentrations of potassium ions. Likewise, in the human coronary artery, the hyperpolarization elicited by bradykinin, which is also mediated by EDHF, is augmented in the presence of <b>perindoprilat</b> and prevented by potassium-induced depolarization. In this blood vessel, contrary to the canine coronary artery, the EDHF-mediated responses occur at concentrations comparable to those initiating the nitric oxide-dependent component. Therefore, the increased production of EDHF, which is induced by kinins, may contribute to the cardiovascular effects of <b>perindoprilat,</b> together with an enhanced production of nitric oxide and vasodilator prostanoids. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate {{the interaction of the}} renin–angiotensin system (RAS), bradykinin and the sympathetic nervous system with cholinergic transmission in the rat airways. Experiments were performed on epithelium-intact and epithelium-denuded preparations of rat isolated trachea which had been incubated with [3 H]-choline to incorporate [3 H]-acetylcholine into the cholinergic transmitter stores. Tracheal preparations were subjected to electrical field stimulation (trains of 1 [*]ms pulses, 5 [*]Hz, 15 [*]V) and the stimulation-induced (S-I) efflux taken as an index of transmitter acetylcholine release. In both epithelium-intact and epithelium-denuded tracheal preparations, the α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist UK 14304 (0. 1 and 1 [*]μM) inhibited the S-I efflux, in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibition of S-I efflux produced by UK 14304 (1 [*]μM) was antagonized by the selective α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (0. 3 [*]μM). Idazoxan (0. 3 [*]μM) alone had no effect on the S-I efflux. Angiotensin II (0. 1 and 1 [*]μM) was without effect on the S-I efflux in either epithelium-intact or epithelium-denuded tracheal preparations. When angiotensin-converting enzyme was inhibited by <b>perindoprilat</b> (10 [*]μM), angiotensin II (1 [*]μM) was also without effect on the S-I efflux. Similarly, in the presence of idazoxan (0. 3 [*]μM), to block prejunctional α 2 -adrenoceptors, angiotensin II (0. 1 and 1 [*]μM) did not alter the S-I efflux. When added alone, <b>perindoprilat</b> (10 [*]μM) did not alter the S-I efflux. In epithelium-denuded preparations, bradykinin (0. 01 – 1 [*]μM) inhibited the S-I efflux. In epithelium-intact preparations, there was also a tendency for bradykinin (0. 1 and 1 [*]μM) to inhibit the S-I efflux but this was not statistically significant. However, when angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase were inhibited by <b>perindoprilat</b> (10 [*]μM) and phosphoramidon (1 [*]μM), respectively, bradykinin (1 [*]μM) significantly inhibited the S-I efflux in epithelium-intact preparations as well as in epithelium-denuded preparations. The inhibition of the S-I efflux produced by bradykinin, in the combined presence of <b>perindoprilat</b> (10 [*]μM) and phosphoramidon (1 [*]μM), was unaffected by the additional presence of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 [*]μM) and/or the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine (100 [*]μM), in either epithelium-intact or epithelium-denuded preparations. In conclusion, the findings of the present study suggest that airway parasympathetic nerves are endowed with α 2 -adrenoceptors which subserve inhibition of transmitter acetylcholine release. Under the present conditions, however, transmitter acetylcholine release is not subject to transneuronal modulation by noradrenaline released from adjacent sympathetic nerves in the airways. Moreover, angiotensin II and <b>perindoprilat</b> do not appear to modulate acetylcholine release from parasympathetic nerves of the airways. In contrast, bradykinin inhibits acetylcholine release from airway parasympathetic nerves but this action of bradykinin is limited by the activity of epithelial angiotensin-converting enzyme and/or neutral endopeptidase. The inhibitory action of bradykinin on cholinergic transmission in the airways does not appear to involve the liberation of prostaglandins or nitric oxide...|$|E

The membrane potential of arterial smooth muscle cells (measured by glass microelectrodes) and changes in isometric force were recorded in tissues from six patients undergoing heart transplantation. In the presence of indomethacin and N(G) - nitro-L-arginine (NLA), the membrane potential was - 48. 3 ± 0. 6 and - 46. 9 ± 0. 6 mV, in preparations with and without endothelium, respectively, and was not affected by treatment with <b>perindoprilat,</b> an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.

Glibenclamide did not inhibit membrane hyperpolarization to bradykinin. In rings contracted with prostaglandin F(2 α), the cumulative addition of bradykinin caused a concentration- dependent relaxation during contractions evoked by prostaglandin F(2 α), which was not abolished by NLA and indomethacin.

In the present experiments, we investigated the effects of captopril or <b>perindoprilat</b> treatment on cardiac endothelial cell proliferation and maximal coronary flow. MI was induced by ligation of the left coronary artery in Wistar rats. Sham-operated and infarcted rats were treated with captopril (12 mg/kg. d s. c.) from either day 0 - 21 (early) or day 21 - 35 (late) after surgery. In isolated retrogradely perfused rat hearts, maximal coronary flow was determined following maximal dilatation with nitroprusside and adenosine (1 mM each). In separate groups, sections of hearts of sham-operated and MI rats treated with BrdU (day 7 - 14) and either captopril or <b>perindoprilat</b> (1 mg/kg. d s. c.; day 0 - 14) were double stained with a monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody and the lectin GSI. The total fraction of DNA synthesizing cells and its proportion of endothelial cells was determined. Maximal coronary flow was completely normalized in MI hearts within three weeks after surgery. Early captopril, but not late captopril, inhibited the normalization of maximal coronary flow in MI hearts (Early: sham, 27. 4 +/- 1. 0; MI, 21. 2 +/- 1. 4 ml/min; P < 0. 05; mean +/- SEM) without affecting the hypertrophic response.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in combination with a subthreshold preconditioning (PC) stimulus to elicit delayed preconditioning against infarction in pig myocardium. BACKGROUNDBradykinin triggers early PC. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increase local bradykinin levels via inhibition of kinin breakdown and have been shown in experimental studies to augment early protection afforded by PC. A role for bradykinin in eliciting delayed PC has not so far been identified. METHODSWe used a two-day protocol. On day 1 (closed chest), pigs were either sham-operated (group 1) or preconditioned, using balloon catheter inflation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, with either a full (4 × 5 min PC, group 2) or subthreshold PC stimulus (2 × 2 min PC, group 3). Additional groups were pre-treated with <b>perindoprilat</b> (0. 06 mg/kg i. v.) before sham (group 4) or subthreshold PC (group 5). On day 2 (open chest), all pigs were subjected to 40 min occlusion of the LAD followed by 3 h of reperfusion. Infarct size was determined by tetrazolium staining. RESULTSGroup 1 had a mean infarct size of 42. 8 ± 3. 2 % of the risk zone. Preconditioning with 4 × 5 min reduced the infarct size to 19. 5 ± 3. 9 % (p < 0. 05). Groups 3 and 4 had infarct sizes not statistically different from group 1. However, combining <b>perindoprilat</b> with subthreshold PC resulted in a significant limitation of the infarction (18. 4 ± 3. 1 % p < 0. 05), comparable with group 2.

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} {{to determine whether or}} not acute exposure to elevated pressure would disrupt endothelium-dependent dilatation by increasing local angiotensin II (ANG II) signaling. Vasomotor responses of mouse-isolated carotid arteries were analyzed in a pressure myograph at a control transmural pressure (PTM) of 80 mmHg. Acetylcholine-induced dilatation was reduced by endothelial denudation or by inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, 100 μM). Transient exposure to elevated PTM (150 mmHg, 180 min) inhibited dilatation to acetylcholine but did not affect responses to the nitric oxide donor diethylamine NONOate. Elevated PTM also increased endothelial reactive oxygen species, and the pressure-induced endothelial dysfunction was prevented by the direct antioxidant and NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin (100 μM). The increase in endothelial reactive oxygen species in response to elevated PTM was reduced by the ANG II type 1 receptor (AT 1 R) antagonists losartan (3 μM) or valsartan (1 μM). Indeed, elevated PTM caused marked expression of angiotensinogen, the precursor of ANG II. Inhibition of ANG II signaling, by blocking angiotensin-converting enzyme (1 μM <b>perindoprilat</b> or 10 μM captopril) or blocking AT 1 Rs prevented the impaired response to acetylcholine in arteries exposed to 150 mmHg but did not affect dilatation to the muscarinic agonist in arteries maintained at 80 mmHg. After the inhibition of ANG II, elevated pressure no longer impaired endothelial dilatation. In arteries treated with <b>perindoprilat</b> to inhibit endogenous formation of the peptide, exogenous ANG II (0. 3 μM, 180 min) inhibited dilatation to acetylcholine. Therefore, elevated pressure rapidly impairs endothelium-dependent dilatation by causing ANG expression and enabling ANG II-dependent activation of AT 1 Rs.

Isometric tension, tissue levels of cGMP, and transmembrane potential were measured in isolated canine coronary arteries as indications of the respective contribution of nitric oxide and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor. In rings of coronary artery with endothelium, relaxations to bradykinin were potentiated by the ACE inhibitors cilazaprilat and <b>perindoprilat.</b> N(G) -Nitro-L-arginine (NLA), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, impaired relaxations to bradykinin. But the presence of ACE inhibitors partially restored this activity. Bradykinin stimulated the production of cGMP, and this was enhanced significantly by ACE inhibitors, indicating an augmented release of nitric oxide. NLA abolished the increase induced by bradykinin irrespective {{of the presence of}} ACE inhibitors. Electrophysiological studies revealed that bradykinin elicited an endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization of vascular smooth muscle that was insensitive to NLA and potentiated by ACE inhibitors. The bradykinin-induced hyperpolarization and NLA-resistant relaxations were transient and impaired by potassium depolarization. Thus, production of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor may account for the NLA-resistant relaxations of canine coronary arteries. The relaxations induced by bradykinin were unaffected by the B 1 kinin receptor antagonist des- Arg 9,[Leu 8]-bradykinin either in the absence or in the presence of NLA but were antagonized by the B 2 kinin receptor antagonist D-Arg[Hyp 3,D-Phe 7]- bradykinin. Molecular exclusion chromatography of 125 I-labeled [Tyr 8]- bradykinin and its degradation products demonstrated that the breakdown of the kinin by isolated coronary arteries was prevented in the presence of <b>perindoprilat.</b> The experiments suggest that the potentiating effect of ACE inhibitors on relaxations evoked by bradykinin involves the protection of bradykinin from breakdown by ACE, which results in greater production of endothelium-derived nitric oxide and hyperpolarizing factor, via stimulation of endothelial B 2 kinin receptors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|ACE inhibitors elicit {{the release}} of endothelium-derived {{relaxing}} factors in perfused isolated canine arteries (Mombouli and Vanhoutte, J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1991, 18 : 926 - 927); this action is antagonized by bradykinin- receptor antagonists suggesting that it is mediated by local kinin generation. The effects of exogenous tissular kallikrein (porcine) were examined in vitro in the isolated canine coronary artery. Isometric tension was measured in blood vessel rings (with and without endothelium) contracted with prostaglandin F(2 α). The kallikrein elicited relaxations in rings with, but not in those without, endothelium. This response was augmented by the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor <b>perindoprilat,</b> and it was antagonized by the selective B 2 -kinin receptor antagonist HOE 140 and aprotinin, an inhibitor of tissular kallikrein. These data suggest that in the canine coronary artery, kallikrein causes relaxations that may be mediated by kinins generated from endogenous kininogens present in the vascular wall. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Short-term (one week) {{and chronic}} (six week) {{cardiovascular}} effects of orally administered perindopril {{were examined in}} the rabbit to demonstrate if short-term results can predict chronic outcomes. In short-term treatment, five doses of perindopril were examined in random order separated by a one week recovery period in each of six rabbits. Two doses of perindopril {{which resulted in a}} moderate hypotensive effect (- 14 mmHg) and no hypotensive effect, respectively, were then selected for long-term treatment. Each rabbit in the short-term study received perindopril in doses of 0. 01, 0. 06, 0. 32, 1. 8 and 10 mg kg(- 1) day(- 1) for a week at a time. Rabbits on long-term treatment received either 0. 3 or 0. 01 mg kg(- 1) day(- 1) perindopril for six weeks. All rabbits had their mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate recorded throughout treatment. Plasma angiotensin I (AngI), <b>perindoprilat,</b> angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition were also assayed. Perindopril treatment for one week produced a dose-dependent hypotensive effect with the threshold dose, 0. 06 mg kg(- 1) day(- 1), producing a 6. 5 +/- 1. 8 mmHg fall in MAP. The highest dose (10. 0 mg kg(- 1) day(- 1)) produced a large fall in blood pressure of - 29. 6 +/- 4. 2 mmHg. The 0. 01 and 0. 06 mg kg(- 1) day(- 1) doses of perindopril produced an average 2. 65 fold increase in plasma AngI levels compared to the initial control. The three higher doses (0. 32 - 10. 0 mg kg(- 1) day(- 1)) of perindopril produced an equivalent 5. 7 fold increase in plasma AngI levels compared to the initial controls. However, over six weeks 0. 01 mg kg(- 1) day(- 1) perindopril induced a similar decrease in MAP as the 30 fold higher dose (- 9. 3 mmHg compared to - 11. 7 mmHg,). This was in spite of a 3 fold difference in plasma <b>perindoprilat</b> concentrations between the high and low dose perindopril groups. Plasma ACE inhibition was > 80 % with both doses of perindopril. The results indicate that while perindopril decreases MAP in a dose-dependent manner in short-term (one week) periods, over longer treatment times (six weeks) low concentrations of perindopril, non-hypotensive with shortterm treatment, may be as anti-hypertensive as considerably higher doses.

40|$|Alterations in the {{formation}} and metabolism of bradykinin (Bk) are hypothesized {{to play a role}} in the pathophysiology of hypertension, atherosclerosis and vascular complications of diabetes. However, despite its prominent role in cardiovascular regulation, studies on bradykinin have been limited by various difficulties in accurate measurements of this peptide in biological samples. In this study, using the LC-ESI-MS method we estimated the conversion of exogenous Bk to its main metabolites — Bk-(1 – 5) and Bk-(1 – 7) — in endothelial cell culture and in fragments of aorta of normotensive (WKY) and hypertensive rats (SHR). The effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitors were more pronounced in SHR: <b>perindoprilat</b> inhibited Bk-(1 – 5) formation by 49 % and 76 % in WKY and SHR rats, respectively, and tiorphan tended to decrease formation of Bk-(1 – 5) in both groups of animals. The degradation of bradykinin and generation of both metabolites were significantly higher in the aorta of SHR rats than in WKY controls. Our results show that even in relatively early hypertension (in 4 -month old SHR rats) inactivation of Bk by aorta wall is enhanced...|$|E
40|$|Binding {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Ins) have high chemical affinity for binding sites of human somatic ACE (hsACE). The enzyme has 2 natural substrates and catalytic domains: one cleaving angiotensin-I (Ang-I) and the other inactivating bradykinin 1 - 9 (Bk). AIM: To test binding selectivity of various ACE-Ins - namely Enalaprilat (E), <b>Perindoprilat</b> (P), Quinaprilat (Q), Ramiprilat (R), Trandolaprilat (T) – for specific Ang-I and Bk binding sites of hsACE. Single displacement binding assays showed the following IC 50 for ACE-Ins and hsACE natural substrates: Q: 0. 35 nM, T: 0. 57 nM, R: 0. 76 nM, P: 1. 05 nM, E: 1. 94 nM, Ang-I: 2. 65 microM and Bk: 1. 31 microM. The order of binding affinity of ACE-Ins to hsACE is: Q>T>R>P>E; (2) All ACE-Ins have a higher affinity for Bk respect to Ang-I binding sites, the order of binding affinity being E>Q>T>R>P for Ang-I and Q>E>T>R>P for Bk binding sites, respectively; (3) P is the ACE-In with the highest selectivity for Bk versus Ang-I binding sites, (the order of Bk/Ang-I selectivity being P>R>Q>T>E). These results {{support the hypothesis that}} affinity differences of ACE-Ins towards sites for Bk degradation exist and may constitute the biochemical grounds in explaining differences obtained in secondary prevention of coronary artery disease...|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that inhibition of tissue {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} (ACE) {{is important for the}} pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors. Radioligand inhibitor binding methods using 125 I- 351 A and either tissue homogenates or in vitro autoradiography have allowed in vitro and ex vivo quantitation of tissue ACE inhibition by a variety of ACE inhibitors. The rank order of potency against plasma as well as lung, kidney, and cardiac homogenates was quinaprilat = benazeprilat greater than <b>perindoprilat</b> greater than lisinopril greater than enalaprilat greater than fosinoprilat. The highest concentration of ACE in the heart was found in the cardiac valves followed by the right and left atria, then the right and left ventricles. Ex vivo studies showed that after oral administration of quinapril, ACE was inhibited dose-dependently in the lung, kidney, aorta and heart for more than 24 h. Tissue bioavailability of the inhibitor is also an important determinant of tissue ACE inhibition. Perindopril crossed the blood-brain barrier and inhibited brain ACE at high doses, but after equivalent doses of quinapril no brain ACE inhibition could be demonstrated. These results suggest that {{it may be possible to}} design ACE inhibitors to have specific effects on ACE in different tissues...|$|E
40|$|In this randomized, {{blinded study}} {{the effect of}} the {{angiotensin}} converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril on electrical stability after myocardial infarction in pigs was compared to placebo. The left anterior descending artery was occluded for 45 min. <b>Perindoprilat</b> (0. 06 mg/kg, n = 12) or saline (n = 12) was injected 15 min before reperfusion. Treatment was continued till day 13 with perindopril (12 mg, once daily) or placebo. At day 14 an electrophysiologic study was performed. The release of creatine phosphokinase did not differ significantly. During the subsequent days, seven of 12 placebo-treated pigs died (six within 24 h), whereas two of the 12 perindopril-treated pigs died (one within 24 h; p < 0. 04). Sustained ventricular tachycardia was inducible in one of five placebo-treated pigs versus three of 10 perindopril-treated survivors (NS). Late potentials had developed in one placebo-treated pig but not in pigs that received perindopril. Characteristics of infarct border zone heterogeneity (percentages of a reference electrode in viable myocardium) such as dispersion of current thresholds (127 +/- 96 vs. 238 +/- 463 % in perindopril-treated pigs, NS) and refractoriness (9. 8 +/- 8. 4 vs. 11. 9 +/- 6. 0 % in perindopril-treated pigs, NS) were comparable. This treatment with perindopril significantly improved survival while electrical stability was comparable between survivors. The latter indicates that a comparable electrical stability 2 weeks after myocardial infarction is obtained in perindopril-treated pigs at a significantly higher survival rate...|$|E
40|$|T he {{cardiovascular}} continuum is {{a sequence}} of related pathological predispositions and events running inexorably (if untreated) from risk factors to end-stage heart disease. Although its intimate mechanism is unknown and presumably multifactorial, key starting points include endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis, making inhibition of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS) the prime treatment target. As a class, angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have an established preventive and therapeutic role across the continuum, enjoying {{the highest levels of}} evidence for efficacy and tolerability. But ACE-inhibitor profiles differ in critical pharmacological and clinical respects. Perindopril and ramipril markedly reduce cardiovascular risk in stable coronary artery disease (CAD), unlike quinapril or trandolapril. Major differences exist in tissue ACE affinity, bradykinin selectivity and potentiation, and effects on endothelial apoptosis. Perindopril (active form: <b>perindoprilat)</b> has a relative tissue affinity much greater than that of other ACE inhibitors, correlating with its antiatherosclerotic activity. Its effect on bradykinin potentiation is particularly marked: the bradykinin/angiotensin I selectivity ratio is much greater in vitro than with other ACE inhibitors, accounting for its greater efficacy in reducing cardiovascular events. In vivo, perindopril increases endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression and activity more than trandolapril, quinapril, ramipril, and enalapril at equihypotensive doses. Perindopril, and to a lesser degree ramipril, are the only ACE inhibitors to significantly reduce apoptotic rate. The burden of the experimental and clinical evidence supports that an ACE inhibitor such as perindopril or ramipril is a superior therapeutic option, in particular in low-dose combination therapies, than certain other ACE inhibitors in stable CAD...|$|E
40|$|Low density {{lipoprotein}} receptor-related protein (LRP) is a multifunctional endocytic receptor {{implicated in}} the modulation {{of a number of}} cellular processes, including the turnover of proteases and the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins. As such, it can {{play a key role in}} the control of fibrosis. The aim of this investigation was to ascertain whether the anti-fibrotic effects exerted by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) <b>perindoprilat</b> on macrophage-conditioned medium (MPCM) -injured human mesangial cells can be modulated by this receptor. Addition of receptor-associated protein to MPCM-injured mesangial cells with and without ACE-I increased the amount of tissue plasminogen activator protein detected in mesangial cell culture supernatants without affecting the protein levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1. The ability of ACE-I to reduce fibronectin was diminished in the presence of receptor-associated protein. ACE-I induced an increase in mesangial cell MMP 9 mRNA, but reduced the MMP 9 enzyme activity detected in mesangial cell supernatants. Mesangial cell lysates from ACE-I-treated cells were able to bind immobilized fibronectin at higher dilutions than cell lysates from untreated cells. Flow cytometry showed that MPCM induced an increase in LRP surface expression in mesangial cells over that in control cells and that this expression was further increased by ACE-I treatment. The increase in LRP expression in response to ACE-I was also observed by Western blotting. Northern blot analysis of RNA extracted from cells following a 24 -h exposure to MPCM with and without ACE-I demonstrated that there was no change in LRP mRNA expression upon ACE-I treatment. In conclusion, we show that ACE-I treatment is able to modulate mesangial cell-surface expression of LRP, providing an additional mechanism whereby ACE-Is can mediate anti-fibrotic actions independent of their hemodynamic actions...|$|E
40|$|The acute {{effects of}} ACE {{inhibition}} on neurohormonal activation are complex. Sympathetic tone decreases {{as a direct}} result of angiotensin II reduction; however, an increase in bradykinin may stimulate sympathetic tone. Consequently, divergent coronary and systemic hemodynamic effects may ensue. As these acute ACE inhibitor effects are incompletely identified in humans, 49 pts with significant (> 70 %) CAD received enalaprilat, <b>perindoprilat</b> or captopril intravenously, which resulted in immediate (≤ 5 ’) 73 % ACE inhibition and a 52 % reduction in arterial angiotensin II. Twenty-two patients received placebo. During a 15 -minute study protocol, placebo induced no changes. In the treated group, arterial norepinephrine (NE) increased at 5 and 15 minutes by 11 % and 12 %, respectively, and arterial epinephrine (E) by 11 % and 14 %, respectively. Heart rate did not change, but contractility (VMAX) increased by 13 % and 4 %, respectively. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased by 2 % and 5 % and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreased by 4 % and 7 %, respectively. Despite the reduction in coronary perfusion pressure, coronary blood flow (CBFj increased by 8 % at 5 minutes, while coronary vascular resistance ICVR) decreased by 10 % and 11 %, respectively, at 5 and 15 minutes. Arterial 6 -keto-F 2 α, the prostacyclin metabolite, was 52 % higher compared to placebo, but increased late, at 15 minutes. Other prostaglandins and cardiac neurohormonal balances remained unaltered. Thus, in contrast to the well-known modulation of sympathetic activity by chronic converting enzyme inhibition, acute ACE inhibition results in an immediate increase in circulating catecholamines and improves myocardial contractility and coronary flow. The effect on sympathetic tone and contractility cannot be explained by changes in circulating angiotensin II and prostaglandins or cardiac renin-angiotensin, which suggests a bradykinin-related effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{angiotensin}} converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril and the diuretic indapamide {{have been shown to}} be effective antihypertensive agents in patients with chronic renal failure. A fixed low-dose combination of these two agents has been proposed in the treatment of hypertension. We evaluated this combination in 26 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and mild to severe chronic renal failure that did not require dialysis. This was a multicenter, open trial consisting of a 2 -week single-blind placebo washout period followed by 12 weeks of active treatment. At week 0, the patients received 2 mg perindopril/ 0. 625 mg indapamide once a day or every other day, with the possibility of dosage adjustment to perindopril 4 mg/indapamide 1. 25 mg at week 2, week 4, or week 8. A pharmacokinetic analysis using a population pharmacokinetic approach was performed at week 8. Twenty-three patients completed the 12 -week study, at which time 14 patients were receiving 2 mg perindopril/ 0. 625 mg indapamide daily, three were receiving 2 mg perindopril/ 0. 625 mg indapamide every other day, and six perindopril 4 mg/indapamide 1. 25 mg. Blood pressure readings (supine) decreased from 170. 4 ± 19. 2 / 101. 5 ± 6. 7 mm Hg before active treatment to 146. 5 ± 19. 7 / 86. 5 ± 10. 6 mm Hg at the end of treatment (P <. 0001). Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that for indapamide and <b>perindoprilat</b> (the active metabolite of perindopril) the area under the curve (AUC 24) increased with the severity of renal failure. No interaction was noted between the two drugs. Mean serum creatinine and sodium and serum potassium levels remained stable during the study. Impairment of renal function occurred in one patient and was considered unrelated to treatment. We conclude that a fixed low-dose perindopril-indapamide combination as first- line treatment has a good safety/efficacy ratio in hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure.

40|$|In a blind, {{randomized}} study, {{the effects}} of perindopril, a nonsulfhydryl-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, were {{compared with those of}} placebo in a closed-chest pig model of myocardial infraction. In anesthetized pigs, my ocardinal ischemia and reperfusion were induced by inflation and deflation of a catheter balloon in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), respectively. Thirty minutes after induction of ischemia and 15 min before reperfusion, a bolus injection of 0. 06 mg/kg <b>perindoprilat</b> (n = 12), the active compound of peridopril, or placebo (n = 12) was administered in the pulmonary artery of these animals. After the acute phase of myocardial infarction, treatment with 12 mg/day perindopril or placebo was continued orally for 2 weeks. During the entire treatment period, 7 of 12 animals died in the placebo group versus 2 of 12 animals in the perindopril group (Fisher's exact test p < 0. 04). This beneficial effect of perindopril on mortality could not be attributed to salvage of myocardial tissue because the increases in creatine phosphokinase and coronary venous purine levels were similar in perindopril- and placebo-treated animals. Neither were there any significant between-treatment differences in the hemodynamic and (neuro) humoral parameters during the acute phase of myocardial infarction. The difference in mortality was observed within 24 h after myocardial infarction. Prevention of acute pump failure and, especially, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias may explain this improvement in survival by perindopril. Retrospectively, logistic regression analysis showed that, irrespective of treatment, survival was inversely correlated to plasma renin activity (PRA) before induction of ischemia (r = - 0. 33; p < 0. 02). High initial PRA levels most likely reflected increased angiotensin II (ANGII) activity, which might have been beneficially influenced by perindopril. In addition, during the acute phase of myocardial infarction, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) levels were significantly higher in animals that survived than in animals that died, but to establish the role of these humoral parameters to morality in myocardial infarction definitively prospective studies are needed...|$|E
40|$|Summary: We {{previously}} demonstrated differing {{blood pressure}} (BP) {{responses to the}} first dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in congestive heart failure (CHF). We wished to confirm the disparate responses to the first dose of these agents, study the response to repeated dosing, and explore possible explanations (slow, tight binding, and steric hindrance) for the phenomenon. Forty-eight elderly patients (aged 51 - 85 years) with stable CHF were studied for 48 hours. Groups (n = 12) received one of the following: (a) perindopril 2 mg orally (p. o.) + placebo intravenously (i. v.) (day 1) and perindopril 2 mg p. o. (day 2); (b) enalapril 2. 5 mg p. o. + placebo i. v. (day 1) and enalapril 2. 5 mg p. o. (day 2); (c) placebo p. o. + <b>perindoprilat</b> 0. 167 mg i. v. (day 1) and perindopril 2 mg p. o. (day 2); or (d) placebo p. o. + placebo i. v. (day 1) and placebo p. o. (day 2). Supine BP was measured on day 1. On day 2, BP was recorded by ambulatory BP monitor. Blood samples were taken at baseline and at intervals during the 48 -h study period for estimation of neurohumoral parameters. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was estimated by plasma ACE inhibition and also by the ratio of angiotensin II (Ang II) /Ang I + Ang II. On day 1, enalapril 2. 5 mg caused a greater decrease in BP than did placebo response between 6 and 9 h postdose. Perindopril 2 mg produced a profile of BP response {{similar to that of}} placebo. Ambulatory BP on day 2 was consistently lower with enalapril as compared with perindopril. Profiles of plasma ACE inhibition were similar with each active therapy. Enalapril therapy produced a greater increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) than did other treatments. There was no temporal dissociation between plasma ACE inhibition and profile of Ang peptides for any treatment. We have confirmed the disparate BP responses to perindopril and enalapril in CHF. We noted no evidence of slow, tight binding or steric hindrance to explain these differences...|$|E
