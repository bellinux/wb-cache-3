40|$|For many years, {{accounting}} discourse {{has been}} concerned with the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> attributes of accounting events. The concept <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> forms one <b>of</b> the central pillars on which the preparation of financial statements is based. For example, financial statements can only be prepared if economic events meet the definition of {{an element of the}} financial statements and have a cost or value that can be measured with reliability. This has created the belief that accounting practices are practices <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> The <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> require that every process <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> be based on an appropriate theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> Given the belief in the accounting discipline that accounting practices are synonymous with practices <b>of</b> <b>measurement,</b> it is to be assumed that acceptable theories <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> exist in the discipline. However, over the decades, researchers in this field have been unsuccessful in creating an acceptable theory <b>of</b> accounting <b>measurement.</b> This suggests that there is a gap between the accounting concept <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> and the scientific <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> The main goals of this thesis are to determine whether the concept <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> in accounting is in harmony with the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the representational theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> and to develop a conceptual model <b>of</b> the accounting <b>measurement</b> problem. Representational theory establishes measurement in the social sciences. Accounting is regarded as a social science. This study applies the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the representational theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> to determine the nature of the gap between the accounting concept <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> and the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> this theory. The very fact of referring to accounting as a measurement discipline implies the presence of an established and well-known theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> in that discipline: a discipline cannot be referred to as a measurement discipline without the existence of such a theory. Therefore, the lack of success of researchers in creating a theory <b>of</b> accounting <b>measurement</b> suggests that accounting is not a measurement discipline and that accountants are currently unaware of this. To test this hypothesis: 1. A critical literature analysis was conducted, investigating whether the accounting concept <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> is in harmony with the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the representational theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> The results <b>of</b> this analysis indicated that the accounting concept <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> is not in harmony with the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the representational theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> 2. A questionnaire was sent to accountants, testing whether they were familiar with the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the representational theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> and their application to the accounting discipline. The results of the survey indicated that accountants are not familiar with the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the representational theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> or their application to the accounting discipline. The main contributions of this study lie in the fact that it reveals that current accounting practices are not in harmony with the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> representational <b>measurement.</b> Accountants should be educated in the purpose <b>of</b> the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> in the social sciences in order to ensure their proper application during accounting measurement.
