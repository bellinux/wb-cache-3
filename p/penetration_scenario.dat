40|$|Transportation {{is one of}} {{the areas}} where Sweden could not yet manage to reduce the CO 2 emissions. One {{solution}} that has been suggested to reduce the CO 2 emissions in this sector is through the mass adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). However, mass EV adoption brings complications with it. Drivers behavior is a critical aspect since people often charge their car at home after work. This could negatively affect the evening load peak and thus cause a high impact on the electricity system. A survey was sent out to current private EV owners in Sweden, to learn about their charging schedules, driving patterns and battery capacity. 226 of 403 replied to the survey which gave a survey reply rate of 56 %. The goal of this work was to estimate the future adoption of EVs, based on the current trends and national targets in order to develop different scenarios. With the scenarios in mind, the projected consumption of EVs for different periods of the day, the magnitude and time of the peak load as well as the overall consumption and CO 2 reduction per year were calculated. Three scenarios were analyzed with 96 000, 650 000 and 1 000 000 electric vehicles where 25 % are defined to be running entirely on electricity in the middle and high <b>penetration</b> <b>scenario</b> since even plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, PHEV where included. The scenarios are estimated as the possible situation in 2030 and a simulation is done in MATLAB for summer and winter cases as well as weekdays and weekends. Results showed that the charging pattern of the EV drivers would cause a peak load at around 20. 00 where the peak load from the overall household consumptions also takes place. The highest consumption takes place during the weekend cases but there were no significant difference between summer and winter. For example the peak consumption of the EVs was 150 MWh during winter and weekends at 20. 00. The annual consumption of the EVs would be 238 GWh, 342 GWh and 616 GWh for the low, middle and high <b>penetration</b> <b>scenario.</b> By analyzing the current installed power of renewable energy sources in Sweden, {{it was found that the}} demand for EVs could be met by renewables entirely today. It was also found that using EVs instead of conventional fossil fueled cars can save up to 264 Mton CO 2 for the low <b>penetration</b> <b>scenario,</b> 447 Mton for the middle <b>penetration</b> <b>scenario</b> and 688 Mton for the high <b>penetration</b> <b>scenario.</b> Different assumptions could have caused deviation from the actual result and it was found during the implementation of the simulation that the survey questions could be improved for future surveys. It was concluded that mass adoption of EVs is possible in terms of electricity production and installed power. However, increase in the evening peak led to the conclusion that balancing of the grid is necessary for example through Vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G), controlled charging or energy storage.

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} Plug-in Electric vehicles(PEVs) on power demand and voltage change when PEVs {{are connected to the}} domestic distribution system. Specifically, it assesses PEVs charging load by charging method in accordance with PEVs penetration scenarios, its percentage of total load, and voltage range under load conditions. Concretely, we develop EMTDC modelling to perform a voltage distribution analysis when the PEVs charging system by their charging scenario was connected to the distribution system under the load condition. Furthermore we present evaluation algorithm to determine whether it is possible to adjust it such that it is in the allowed range by applying ULTC when the voltage change rate by PEVs charging scenario exceed its allowed range. Also, detailed analysis of the impact of PEVs on power distribution system was carried out by calculating existing electric power load and additional PEVs charge load by each scenario on new-town in Korea to estimate total load increases, and also by interpreting the subsequent voltage range for system circuits and demonstrating conditions for countermeasures. It was concluded that total loads including PEVs charging load on new-town distribution system in Korea by PEVs <b>penetration</b> <b>scenario</b> increase significantly, and the voltage range when considering ULTC, is allowable in terms of voltage tolerance range up to a PEVs penetration of 20 % by scenario. Finally, we propose the charging capacity of PEVs that can delay the reinforcement of power distribution system while satisfying the permitted voltage change rate conditions when PEVs charging load is connected to the power distribution system by their charging <b>penetration</b> <b>scenario...</b>|$|E

30|$|Regulating {{power in}} a {{deregulated}} power system is always needed to increase system reliability and to ensure power supply security. The need for regulating reserves is growing {{with the increase of}} wind power integration in power systems. Beside this, effective way of bids activation is also of high importance. In this article, an algorithm has been designed in order to simulate the actions similar to the control room with respect to real time active power balance control. The algorithm ‘rolling balance’ is exemplified and implemented for the case of a power system that reflects the dynamics of the future Danish power system with a high wind <b>penetration</b> <b>scenario.</b> The dynamic model of a power system uses input time series from an hour-ahead power balancing model (SimBa) for power generation, load demand and power exchange corresponding to one particular day with high wind speed and high load demand.|$|E
30|$|All of {{the noted}} issues provide {{context for the}} scope of analysis. A study {{examining}} the wind potential in China stated that changes in thermal plant operations under a 30 -percent wind <b>penetration</b> <b>scenario</b> caused net carbon dioxide emission reductions to be 20 percent less than projections that ignored such changes [22]. China, which currently has {{more than double the}} installed coal capacity of the U.S., has a required uniform coal plant utilization rate of 47.7 percent, which is the lowest observed rate since the 1970 s [25]. When comparing the 100 most efficient coal plants in the U.S. and China, Chinese plants, on average, generate the same amount of electricity with 8.2 percent lower carbon dioxide emissions, largely due to the presence of new supercritical and ultra-supercritical technology deployment [25]. It is unclear how falling utilization rates, which have experienced a 22 percent decline since 2011, have affected Chinese coal greenhouse gas emission intensities.|$|E
40|$|Wind power {{introduces}} variability into {{electric power}} systems. Due {{to the physical}} characteristics of wind, most of this variability occurs at inter-hour time-scales and coal units are therefore technically capable of balancing wind. Operators of coal-fired units have raised concerns that additional cycling will be prohibitively costly. Using PJM bid-data, we observe that coal operators are likely systematically under-bidding their startup costs. We then consider {{the effects of a}} 20 % wind <b>penetration</b> <b>scenario</b> in the coal-heavy PJM West area, both when coal units bid business as usual startup costs, and when they bid costs accounting for the elevated wear and tear that occurs during cycling. We conclude that while 20 % wind leads to increased coal cycling and reduced coal capacity factors under business as usual startup costs, including full startup costs shifts the burden of balancing wind onto more flexible units. This shift has benefits for CO 2, NOX, and SO 2 emissions {{as well as for the}} profitability of coal plants, as calculated by our dispatch model...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recently, many {{countries}} have been pushing for a higher share of renewable energy sources, especially wind, in their generation mix. However, the intermittent and uncertain nature of wind power imposes a limit on the extent it can replace the conventional generation resources. In a high wind <b>penetration</b> <b>scenario,</b> the Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) offers {{a solution to the}} grid operation problems. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to evaluate the merits of price-based operation of BESS in a real-time market with high wind penetration using frequency-linked pricing.

Simulations for different wind penetration scenarios are carried out on an isolated area test system. Wind speed sequence is generated using composite wind speed model.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{energy analysis}} software tool (THESIS) {{has been developed}} for assessing the impact of major technological shifts {{in the provision of}} energy for integrated transport, electrical power, and heating/cooling applications. Historically, transport and electrical power have been treated as independent sectors, but, in the case where hydrogen fuel cells are extensively used in motive applications, complex inter-dependencies arise between the two (e. g. production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water, alternative use of hydrogen for electricity storage and subsequent regeneration). The THESIS model characterises a country’s (or region’s) primary energy flows, energy distribution system, secondary energy production processes (e. g. electricity generation), and end-use consumption, including a major sub-model of the Transport sector which keeps track of the size of vehicle fleets and the penetration rate of alternative fuels.

30|$|Equipment {{performance}} is plant specific and providing hourly forecasts by region several years out {{can be highly}} inaccurate, so quantifying the economic costs of startups {{is beyond the scope}} of the analysis. Estimates for large coal units have been reported to be $ 54 per MW, $ 64 per MW, and $ 104 per MW for cold, warm, and hot starts, respectively [20]. Under a scenario where 33 percent of total generation in western states originated from wind and solar sources, cycling costs have been estimated to be between $ 35 million and $ 157 million for the region. This translates to costs of $ 0.14 to $ 0.67 per MWh over the system, representing 2 percent to 7 percent of total production costs [21]. Other sources note that when examining overall wholesale electricity prices, startup costs were inconsequential [22]. It has been projected that under a 30 -percent renewable <b>penetration</b> <b>scenario</b> in western states, a 500 MW coal plant would experience a dramatic increase in cycles below a 50 percent capacity factor, moving from fewer than five annual occurrences to more than 50 [11].

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problems associated}} with security of the electricity supply in the UK. The British electricity supply industry has experienced a significant structural change. Competition has been brought into the electricity industry and a single wholesale electricity market of Great Britain has been established. The evolution of the British electricity market raises new challenges, such as improving the liquidity of wholesale markets and developing clean energy. The wholesale electricity prices are less transparent and trading arrangements are very complex in the British electricity market. In this thesis a fundamental model, called a stack model, has been developed in order to forecast wholesale electricity prices. The objective of the stack model is to identify the marginal cost of power output based on the fuel prices, carbon prices, and availability of power plants. The stack model provides a reasonable marginal cost curve for the industry which can be used as an indicator for the wholesale electricity price. In addition, the government's targets for climate change and renewable energy bring new opportunities for wind energy. Under the large wind energy <b>penetration</b> <b>scenario</b> the security of the energy supply will be essential. We have modelled the correlations between wind speed data for a set of wind farms. The correlation can be used to measure the portfolio risk of the wind farms. Electricity companies should build their portfolio of wind farms with low or negative correlations in order to hedge the risk from the intermittency of wind. We found that the VAR(1) model is superior to other statistic models for modelling correlations between wind speeds of a wind farm portfolio...|$|E

In this thesis, I investigate the impact of electric vehicles based on this interaction {{in order to determine}} the possible benefits of controlling electric vehicle charging and how they compare to other vehicle options based on optimization models of electricity systems. I estimate the cost reductions from controlled charging of electric vehicles in the New York power system both with and without a high wind penetration and with and without the need for capacity expansion. In this power system, controlled charging can reduce the generation costs associated with charging the vehicles in half, with slightly higher cost reductions in high wind scenarios. I also estimate the cost reductions along with the changes in carbon and criteria air pollutant emissions due to controlled charging in the PJM power system. I examine both current and future grid scenarios, several plug-in vehicles types, and a high wind <b>penetration</b> <b>scenario.</b> Again I find that controlled charging can significantly reduce the costs of charging the vehicles, on the order of 30 % of the generation costs to meet the charging demand. However, the environmental and health damages from the emissions cause total social costs to be higher with controlled charging in most cases. Finally, using the charging emissions from PJM, I evaluate the lifecycle emissions of plug-in, hybrid, and conventional vehicles in this region to determine which has lower environmental and health damages. I find that given the representative vehicles studied, plug-in electric vehicles have higher lifecycle damages than hybrids in PJM in 2010 but have lower lifecycle damages in a forecasted 2018 PJM power system...|$|E
40|$|Wind {{power has}} the {{potential}} to significantly reduce air emissions from the electric power sector, but the best wind sites are located far from load centers and will require new transmission lines. Texas currently has the largest installed wind power capacity in the U. S., but a lack of transmission capacity between {{the western part of the}} state, where most wind farms are located, and the major load centers in the east has led to frequent wind curtailments. State policymakers have addressed this issue by approving a $ 5 billion transmission project, the Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ), which will expand the transmission capacity to 18, 456 MW by 2014. In this paper, we examine the impacts of large-scale wind power in ERCOT, the power market that serves 85 % of the state’s load, after the completion of the CREZ project. We assess the generation displaced and the resulting emissions reductions. We then examine the public costs of wind to estimate the CO 2 abatement cost. We develop an economic dispatch model of ERCOT to quantify the generation displaced by wind power and the emissions reductions in 2014. Since there is uncertainty about the amount of new wind developed between now and 2014, three wind penetration scenarios were assessed that correspond to wind supplying 9 %, 14 % and 21 % of ERCOT’s total generation. In the 21 % wind energy <b>penetration</b> <b>scenario,</b> the CREZ transmission capacity is fully utilized, and wind displaces natural gas 74 % of the time and coal 26 % of the time.

Lower wind penetrations result in gas being displaced more frequently, lower emissions reductions and an abatement cost up to $ 91 per ton of CO 2.
