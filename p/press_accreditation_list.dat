From 1929 he was {{the secretary general of}} the Société des auteurs de films which sought to establish greater recognition for the authorial rights of filmmakers.

The union achieved improvements in rates of pay, hours of work, and insurance arrangements for accidents at work, as well as <b>press</b> <b>accreditation</b> for film journalists. The union could also speak with one voice for all aspects of the industry. After the war L'Herbier continued his lobbying for French cinema by chairing the Comité de défense du cinéma français.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 191 - 214) This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} role of women war correspondents in the Vietnam War between the years 1961 and 1975. Although war correspondence is male-dominated field, women have followed the profession for more than one hundred years. Women journalists have often been considered as footnotes to journalism history, and most studies of war correspondence in Vietnam treat women superficially, if at all. There were more than forty women correspondents in Vietnam. They represented major news media such as the New York Times and United Press International, and they won major journalism awards, including a Pulitzer Prize. As early as 1961, when the American role in Vietnam was an advisory one, a woman correspondent named Dickey Chapelle was covering the war. As the American commitment increased so did the number of women correspondents also increased, with more than twenty on the <b>accreditation</b> <b>list</b> in 1968. Most were Americans, but women correspondents also came from France, Holland, Greece, Australia, and Great Britain. They wrote on subjects ranging from human interest to battlefields. Their attitudes from patriotic to strongly anti-war. One women covered the war from the North Vietnamese side. Several of the women were wounded, four were taken prisoner, and two were killed. The thesis is arranged chronologically from 1961 until the American withdrawal in 1975. Women were found to have covered almost every aspect of the war...|$|R

50|$|The first Standing Committee of Correspondents {{was created}} in 1879 to {{eliminate}} lobbyists from the press galleries. With the approval of House and Senate leaders, reporters drafted a set of requirements for <b>accreditation.</b> <b>Press</b> passes were issued only to those whose primary source of income was journalism, and who reported by telegraph to a daily newspaper. The rules eliminated lobbyists, but also women and minorities. Nineteenth-century womenreporters were confined to social news coverage, which did not justify the cost of telegraphing. African American reporters were limited to the black press, which were then all weekly papers. Not until the 1940s did women and minorities overcome these obstacles.|$|R
