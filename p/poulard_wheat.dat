25|$|Many genera {{and species}} of Triticeae are allopolyploids, having more {{chromosomes}} than seen in typical diploids. Typical allopolyploids are tetraploid or hexaploid, XXYY or XXYYZZ. The creation of polyploid species results from natural random events tolerated by polyploid-capable plants. Natural allopolyploid plants may have selective advantages and some may permit the recombination of distantly related genetic material. <b>Poulard</b> <b>wheat</b> {{is an example}} of a stable allotetraploid wheat.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} aim {{of plant}} breeding {{is to improve}} the agronomic or nutritional qualities of a crop. Typical goals are improved yield, reduced susceptibility to diseases and pests, homogeneous maturation (to optimize harvest) and increased tolerance to environmental stressesâ€”i.e., drought, acid soil, high or cold temperature, etc. Most of the known wheat species today are polyploid.Whereas common bread wheat is hexaploid, Khorasan wheat is tetraploid. To do further breeding with this tetraploid Khorasan wheat, the genetic pool to use is a little bit limited to the tetraploid subspecies of triticum turgidum such as Durum (subsp. durum), Polish (subsp. polonicum), Persian (subsp. carthlicum), Emmer (subsp. dicoccum) and <b>Poulard</b> (subsp. turgidum) <b>wheat.</b> Especially to develop resistances against common fungi (e.g. Fusarium Head Blight), this genomic pool is interesting. Problematic in this case, is the economic unimportance of most of the tetraploid subspecies of wheat (except Durum), which limits the investment to do intensive breeding, especially compared to the highly important common bread wheat.|$|R
