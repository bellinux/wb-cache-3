40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the {{monoterpene}} ketone l-[G- 3 H]-menthone is reduced to the epimeric alcohols l-menthol and d-neomenthol in leaf discs of flowering peppermint (Mentha piperita L.), and that a portion of the menthol is converted to menthyl acetate while the bulk of the neomenthol is transformed to neomenthyl-β-d-glucoside (Croteau, Martinkus 1979 Plant Physiol 64 : 169 - 175). The metabolic disposition of the epimeric reduction products of the ketone, which is a major constituent of peppermint oil, is highly specific, in that little neomenthyl acetate and little menthyl glucoside are formed. However, when l-[3 - 3 H]menthol and d-[3 - 3 H]neomenthol are separately administered to leaf discs, both menthyl and neomenthyl acetates and menthyl and neomenthyl glucosides are formed with nearly equal facility, suggesting that the metabolic specificity observed with the ketone precursor was not a function of the specificity of the transglucosylase or transacetylase but rather a result of compartmentation of each stereospecific dehydrogenase with the appropriate transferase. A UDP-glucose:monoterpenol glucosyltransferse, which utilized d-neomenthol or l-menthol as glucose acceptor, was demonstrated in the 105, 000 g supernatant of a peppermint leaf homogenate, and the enzyme was partially purified and characterized. Co-purification of the acceptor-mediated activities, and differential activation and inhibition studies, provided strong evidence that the same UDP-glucose-dependent enzyme could transfer glucose to either l-menthol or d-neomenthol. Determination of Km and V for the epimeric monoterpenols provided nearly identical values. The acetylcoenzyme A:monoterpenol acetyltransferase previously isolated from <b>peppermint</b> <b>extracts</b> (Croteau, Hooper 1978 Plant Physiol 61 : 737 - 742) was re-examined using l-[3 - 3 H]menthol and d-[3 - 3 H]neomenthol as acetyl acceptors, and the Km and V for both epimers were, again, very similar. These results demonstrate that the specific in vivo conversion of l-menthone to l-menthyl acetate and d-neomenthyl-β-d-glucoside cannot be attributed to the selectivity of the transferases, and they clearly indicate that the metabolic specificity observed is a result of compartmentation effects...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{turnover}} {{analysis of}} chlorophylls, carotenoids and tocopherol in green leaves by LC-MS and FTICR-MSBjörn Thiele*, Andrea Neuwohner, Siegfried Jahnke, Ingar Janzik, Shizue MatsubaraIBG- 2 : Pflanzenwissenschaften, Forschungszentrum Jülich, D- 52425 Jülich, GermanyAbstract: Chlorophylls and carotenoids are {{belonging to the}} photosynthetic pigments in chloroplasts of plants playing central roles in light absorption and photoprotection. Synthesis and degradation of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) have been mostly studied in leaves during greening or senescence but not in mature leaves. The question how much biosynthesis and degradation of different photopigments occurs in photosynthesizing green leaves is still open. In order to gain insight into photopigment turnover of mature leaves we conducted long-term 13 CO 2 labelling with peppermint (Mentha x piperita) and analyzed the 13 C/ 12 C signature of chlorophylls (Chls), carotenoids and tocopherols (Toc) by LC-MS and FTICR-MS. Materials and Methods: Peppermint plants were cultivated in a 13 CO 2 containing atmosphere for 34 d [1]. Hereupon they were transferred to ambient CO 2 where samples were collected from mature leaves over 7 days. Leave samples from day 0, 1, 2 and 7 were extracted and analyzed by LC-PDA-ESI(+) -MS using a C 30 column. High resolved FTICR mass spectra were obtained from some exemplary samples in order to distinguish peaks of pigment isotopomers from those of co‐eluting matrix compounds and to assign mass peaks to distinct empirical formulae. The 13 C degrees of labelling (DoL) of various photopigments over time were determined from the mass spectra. Additional MS/MS experiments were performed to gain insight into the position of 13 C in the photopigment molecules. Results: The main photopigments in <b>peppermint</b> <b>extracts</b> were Chls a and b, -Toc and the xanthophylls lutein, zeaxanthin, antheraxanthin, neoxanthin (Neo) and violaxanthin and finally -carotene (-Car). While Chls and -Toc predominantly formed [M + H]+ adducts in the positive ESI mode, [M]+ and [M + H – H 2 O]+ adducts were additionally detected for carotenoids. After clearing up the mass spectra from matrix compound derived peaks DoLs were determined. Their time courses showed a high turnover for Chl a and -Car, a lower non-linear decline in DoL for xanthophylls but almost {{no change in the}} DoL for Neo. A distinct maximum peak in the mass spectra of -Toc from day 1 – 7 located between the extreme values for non-labelling and full labelling indicated a recycling of the phytol moiety during turnover of -Toc [2]. MS/MS experiments supported this hypothesis. Further results concerning turnover of Chls and xanthophylls will be also presented and discussed in the biological context.

This plasma-based, wavelength-selectable ionization source, which can use Xe, Kr, Ar, Ne, or He as the plasma gas, enables ionization of GC-amenable compounds with ionization energies below 8. 4, 10, 11. 6, 16. 5, or 22. 4  eV, respectively. The advantages of soft ionization include enhanced molecular ions, reduced fragmentation, and reduced background noise as compared to electron ionization. In the study presented here for two plasma gases, we demonstrate that Kr plasma, which is softer than Ar plasma, yields molecular ions with a relative intensity. 60 % for 11 of the 16 test compounds. When using this “tunable ” plasma to ionize the analytes, {{there is the possibility}} for selective ionization and less fragmentation, which may lead to increased sensitivity and may help structure elucidation, especially when using high-resolution mass spectrometry that generates accurate masses within a few parts per million (ppm) mass errors. Data generated with the Ar plasma and real matrices such as a <b>peppermint</b> <b>extract,</b> a plum extract, and an orange peel extract, spiked with 16 test compounds, indicate that the test compounds can be detected at 1 – 10  pg/μL of extract, and compounds such as menthone, limonene, eucalyptol, pinene, caryophy-lene, and other C 15 H 24 isomers, which are present in the peppermint and the orange peel extracts at ppm to percent levels, do not appear to interfere with the determination of the chlorophenoxy acid methyl esters or the chlorinated herbicides, although there were matrix effects when the test compounds were spiked at 1 – 10  pg/μL of extract.

This study discusses the use of peppermint (Mentha piperita L.) methanolic extract against bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus and fungal species such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton verrucosum, and Candida albicans. Objectives This research aimed to investigate the inhibitory potential of M. piperita methanolic extract against some bacteria and fungi isolated from humans. Materials and Methods The methanolic extract was prepared by standard procedure, and total phenol, total flavonoid, and total anthocyanin content were determined using a spectrophotometer. Antimicrobial activity against the aforementioned bacteria and fungi strains was evaluated using the disc diffusion method. Results The contents of total phenol, flavonoid, and anthocyanin as well as antimicrobial activities and antifungal properties were enhanced by the increase of extract concentration. The results showed that the antimicrobial activity of leaf extract was more powerful against Bacillus subtilis (1. 39 mm) than Staphylococcus aureus (1. 29 mm), Escherichia coli (1. 20 mm), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1. 10 mm) based on the growth inhabitation zone. The most powerful antifungal activity of <b>peppermint</b> <b>extract</b> was observed against Trichophyton verrucosum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes (1. 49 and 1. 48 mm, respectively). Conclusions Due to phenolic content, methanolic extract of M. piperita has moderate antibacterial and antifungal properties against the aforementioned gram positive and gram negative bacteria and fungi strains...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Neryl pyrophosphate, {{rather than}} geranyl pyrophosphate, is {{believed}} to be the immediate biological precursor of the cyclohexanoid monoterpenes because the cis- 2, 3 -double bond readily permits cyclization. Biosynthesis of neryl pyrophosphate could occur by either of two principal mechanisms: direct cis condensation of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate with isopentenyl pyrophosphate or trans-cis isomerization of geranyl pyrophosphate, Flavin-dependent enzymes that catalyze the isomerization of geraniol and geranyl phosphate to nerol and neryl phosphate, respectively, have now been isolated from peppermint and pea leaves, and carrot tops. Isomerization also occurs non-enzymatically but is greatly accelerated in the presence of the enzyme extracts. Various factors are required in order to demonstrate enzymatic isomerization. These factors are: (1) a flavin (FAD or FMN); (2) a thiol or sulfide (glutathione, dithiothreitol, (i-rnercaptoethanol, or Na₂S); and (3) light (400 - 500 nm wavelength). If the flavin is partially reduced chemically, light is not required. Non-enzymatic isomerization also occurs if sulfite is the sulfur compound added. When a cell-free <b>peppermint</b> <b>extract</b> is utilized, enzymatic isomerization in the light is a function of: enzyme, substrate, FAD, and dithiothreitol concentrations; temperature (at 35 ° the rate is twice the rate at 25 °); and pH (7. 5 optimum). Isomerization is also increased by anaerobic conditions. Complete reduction of the flavin inhibits isomerization. Inhibition is also observed if N-ethylmaleimide is present during the reaction, but pretreatment of the enzyme with NEM or 2 -hydroxymercuribenzoate, which is removed prior to incubation with substrate, causes no inhibition. The various substrates are isomerized at different rates, Nerol appears to be isomerized twice as fast as geraniol, and the apparent equilibrium for the reaction is 67...|$|E
40|$|In {{industry}} today standard oxidative quality {{parameters are}} based on measurements of primary and secondary oxidation products, measured by PV and AV respectively. These methods are all prone to limitations and weaknesses, and their suitability for application on marine oils is not well documented. An increase in fish oil products with added flavor, color compounds, antioxidants and vitamins has entered the market in recent years. However, no documentation {{on the effect of}} these additives on the oxidation parameters has been found. The aim of this thesis was therefore to study the effect of variations in procedures in an attempt to highlight weaknesses and further to establish the most suitable procedures for each method when performing measurements on marine oils. In addition, the effect of antioxidants and additives on the oxidation parameters in cod liver oil has been evaluated. In this thesis, PV measurements by iodometric titration and by the ferric thiocyanate method were used to measure primary oxidation products, and AV and TBARS measurements were used to measure secondary oxidation products. Uncertainty of the methods was determined by performing n -measurements at different stages of the oxidation process. Measurement by the iodometric titration method was found to have a lower detection limit of PV > 2. 0 mEq peroxide kg- 1 oil, with an uncertainty of &# 177; 2 %. Measurement by the ferric thiocyanate method was found to have a lower detection limit of PV &# 8805; 3. 6 mEq peroxide kg- 1 oil, with an uncertainty of &# 177; 10 %. Measurement by the AV method was found to have a lower detection limit of AV&# 8805; 1. 3, with an uncertainty of &# 177; 5 %. Measurements by the TBARS method was found to have a lower detection limit of 0. 7 &# 956;M TBARS /g sample, with an uncertainty of &# 177; 12 %. The published method of the International Dairy Federation (IDF) for PV determination was evaluated by comparison with {{a modified version of the}} method. Factors such as type of solvent used, deaeration of reagents, premixing of reagents and addition of antioxidant were differences between the methods. It was observed significant difference in absorbance in the two methods, and it was therefore concluded that the varied factor had an influence on the method. It is necessary to perform further experiments to determine which of the varied factors that cause variations in the absorbance measurements. PV measurements by the iodometric titration method were found to be influenced by the stirring method, reagent reaction time and oxygen removal. Stirring by magnetic stirring was found to give a higher PV compared to gentle stirring. The importance of the 1 minute reagent reaction time was strengthened as the PV was found to rapidly increased at prolonged reagent reaction times. It was demonstrated that this to a higher degree is important for marine oils compared to vegetable oils, as new hydroperoxides are formed more rapidly in the unstable marine oils. A significant influence of oxygen removal in reagents was detected in cod liver oil. The findings in this thesis suggests that stirring by magnetic stirring, 1 minute reagent reaction time and deaeration of all reagents should be standard procedure when PV is determined in marine oils by the iodometric titration method. Among eight investigated antioxidants and additives, Q 10, tocopherol, vitamin K 1, lemon &# 150; and <b>peppermint</b> <b>extract</b> was found to significantly elevate the PV measured by iodometric titration. For PV determination by the ferric thiocyanate method, lemon extract was found to significantly elevate the PV. Rosemary extract was found to significantly lower the AV measurement, while lemon extract to a very high degree elevated the AV measurement. In measurements by the TBARS method only lemon extract was found to significantly interfere with the method, leading to an elevated TBARS value. Both methods for PV detection were influenced by several of the investigated antioxidants and additives. Clearly there is need for reevaluation of the methods is use today and development of new methods. New methods for measurements of secondary decomposition products are especially needed for fish oils with added lemon extracts as today&# 146;s measurements by the AV and TBARS method give highly unreliable results. </p...|$|E
