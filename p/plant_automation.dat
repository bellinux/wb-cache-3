50|$|Electrical and {{electronic}} devices have always {{played an important}} role in chemical process <b>plant</b> <b>automation.</b> However, initially, simple thermometers such as those containing mercury, and pressure gauges which were completely mechanical in nature were used to monitor process conditions (such as the temperature, pressure and level in a chemical reactor). Process conditions were adjusted based largely on a human operator's heuristic knowledge of the process behavior. Even with electronic automation installed, many process still require substantial operator interaction, particularly during the start-up phase of the process, or during deployment of a new technology.|$|E

50|$|As {{technology}} developed, {{the control}} system and control methods were tasked to continue to advance {{a higher degree of}} <b>plant</b> <b>automation</b> with each passing year. Highly complex material processing called for highly complex control methodologies. Also, global competition pushed manufacturing operations to increase production while using less energy, and producing less waste. In the days of the panel boards, a special kind of engineer was required to understand a combination of the electronic equipment associated with process measurement and control, the control algorithms necessary to control the process (PID basics), and the actual process that was being utilised to make the products. Around the mid 80's, we entered the digital revolution. Distributed control systems (DCS) were a boon to the industry. The engineer could now control the process without having to understand the equipment necessary to perform the control functions. Panel boards were no longer required, because all of the information that once came across analogue instruments could be digitised, stuffed into a computer and manipulated to achieve the same control actions once performed with amplifiers and potentiometers.|$|E
50|$|The same {{sequence}} in reverse order is effected for loading, {{with the side}} slots being replaced by the retaining pins on the wagon.In the unloading cycle, the side slots of the corner fitting are as an achievement of the VIT project also partly funded by the European Union.Operating under the catenary, though disconnected during the operation for safety reasons, Metrocargo eliminates the cost and time associated with shunting (coupling and decoupling wagons, transfer to marshalling yards by diesel locos, train breakdown and composition) {{that take place in}} traditional terminals, where trains need to be removed from the electrified line for unloading. Metrocargo was originally developed as a technical means necessary for creating a network for the intermodal transport of containers and swap bodies, distributed over a territory. In the process, it proved to be very fast (projections show a 40 wagon train can be unloaded and reloaded in less than one hour), which opened up new business possibilities, typically shuttling load units between ports and dry-ports. The construction technology being modular, equipment can be planned according to available space and number of containers to be handled, and increased as necessary. Today the system is fitted with a stand-alone active safety system detecting human presence in the work area, (which means that sound alarms {{do not have to be}} used). This system has been developed within the VIT project.Metrocargo is perfectly consistent with the goal of minimising environmental impact, because both atmospheric and acoustic pollution are almost totally eliminated by the electrically powered automation system. There are no local GHG emissions other than by trucks servicing the terminal, and noise level is very low.Electro-mechanical parts and <b>plant</b> <b>automation</b> software for load/unload were subjected to an exhaustive stress test under the control of an independent entity with specific knowledge of automated plants: Functionality and performance of all components were analysed and data collected and validated. The two main applications of Metrocargo are distributed intermodality and Port to dry-port shuttling.|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} process in steel making involves plenty of variables {{to know the}} actual status in plant operations and the deviations from optimal and safe operating conditions. The deviations depend on diverse uncertainties due to the material variability and, more in general, the complexity of modeling the physical and chemical transformations occurring in the production assets. The transformations are partially observable by means of measurable parameters. The “man in the loop” is then essential {{to cope with the}} tasks of monitoring, controlling and diagnosing the asset health status. Today, these tasks can be aided by the <b>plant</b> <b>automation</b> as a lever to support supervision and decision by the operators. The project reported by this paper was developed in this context, leading to enhance the decision-making capabilities. In particular, a condition monitoring tool was deployed by seeking the opportunities provided by <b>plant</b> <b>automation</b> enhanced according to Industry 4. 0 paradigm. The tool is now running on an Electric Arc Furnace of the steel making plant of Tenaris Dalmine, in Italy. The project used the experience and knowledge gained by Tenaris Dalmine process and maintenance operators as foundation for initiating the conceptualization of a novel and approach. Thus, the tool – resulting from engineering and implementation of the concept – is integrating <b>plant</b> <b>automation</b> with intelligent data analytics, as a result of close collaboration between Tenaris Dalmine and the Manufacturing group of the Department of Management, Economics and Industrial Engineering of Politecnico di Milano. The tool enables to detect incipient failures through monitoring of the furnace panels and of the hearth/bottom of the furnace; thus, it allows to enhance the operations by avoiding downtimes that may lead to risky consequences on people safety. The tool has to be considered an example of smart maintenance and its implementation reflects a path towards building cyber-physical systems in production...|$|E
