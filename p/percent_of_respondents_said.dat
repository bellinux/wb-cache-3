The 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey results permit an examination of the proportion of women who reported receiving some of the recommended procedures. Women were asked if they received six of the recommended procedures (blood pressure measurement, urine test, blood test, weight and height taken, pelvic examination, and pregnancy history) in the first two visits, and whether they received seven types of advice or counseling (nutrition; vitamin use; smoking, alcohol, and drug use cessation; breastfeeding; and maternal weight gain) any time during their pregnancy.

For our study, a thirty-three-item survey and cover letter were electronically mailed to academic deans at sixty-five accredited dental schools in the United States and Canada in the fall of 2007. The response rate was 77 percent. According to the responses to this survey, the primary topics covered in the didactic curriculum regarding periodontal oral-systemic disease are aging, CVD, diabetes, and tobacco use. Eighty-eight <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>respondents</b> reported that their students are knowledge-able about the role of inflammation and its impact on oral-systemic conditions.
