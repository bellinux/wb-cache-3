5|$|In Budapest Tales (1976), Szabó traded his earlier, complex {{narrative}} structures, {{characterized by}} flashbacks and dreams, {{for a more}} linear one. At the same time, he traded the literal representation of history for an allegorical one. The film follows a disparate group of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> together {{on the outskirts of}} an unnamed city {{at the end of an}} unnamed war to repair a damaged tram and ride it into the city. Allegorically, the film was interpreted by critics variously as representing Hungarian history specifically or universal human responses to war and reconstruction more generally.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, an ex-student of Scully's (Kate Twa) asks the agents to help her with her first {{investigation}} concerning a number of disappearances with very few clues. Mulder ponders the idea of spontaneous human combustion but rethinks it when they find a man, Chester Ray Banton (Tony Shalhoub), who is afraid of his own shadow. Banton is a scientist researching dark matter, and his shadow has somehow developed the ability to disintegrate <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> across it.|$|E

25|$|The band {{is not in}} {{competition}} with other Christian bands. We feel we are competing with Journey, Styx and REO Speedwagon. We {{need to be aware}} of them, because the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> to see Petra go to see those bands as well. We are being very naïve if we don't keep that in mind. We need to have a light system, sound system and presentation that will be competitive with those groups.|$|E
25|$|Drilling has {{increased}} {{two out of}} six “criteria” pollutants (particulate matter and ozone) that the EPA regulates due to their negative impacts. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> in contact with these air pollutants can have severe health problems such as respiratory issues, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.

25|$|Mecca {{has been}} the site of several {{incidents}} and failures of crowd control {{because of the large}} numbers of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> to make the Hajj. For example, on 2 July 1990, a pilgrimage to Mecca ended in tragedy when the ventilation system failed in a crowded pedestrian tunnel and 1,426 people were either suffocated or trampled to death in a stampede.

25|$|In Gaza, desalinated {{brackish}} groundwater {{has become}} {{an important source of}} drinking water. Over 20,000 consumers in over 50% of the Gaza households have installed domestic ‘reverse osmosis’ (RO) units to desalinate water for drinking purposes. The water quality is high, though the water lacks basic minerals. As of January 2014, there were 18 neighborhood desalination plants in the Gaza strip, providing safe drinking water for free to 95,000 <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> to fill their canisters at the plants. 13 of these plants are operated by UNICEF.|$|E
25|$|The Noongar {{themselves}} are tackling their own issues, for example, the Noongar Patrol, {{which is an}} Aboriginal Advancement Council initiative. It {{was set up to}} deter Aboriginal young people from offending behaviour and reduce the likelihood of their contact with the criminal justice system. Most people in Perth would associate this with patrols run in the entertainment hotspot Northbridge. The patrol uses mediation and negotiation with indigenous youth in an attempt to curb anti-social and offending behaviour of young <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> into the city at night.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the rains}} comes, and the villagers {{celebrate}} with ancient rituals and dances. During this time, Karega starts a correspondence with the lawyer {{that he met}} in Nairobi, wishing to educate himself further. To celebrate the rain's coming, Nyakinyua brews a drink from the Thang'eta plant, which all of the villagers drink. Karega tells the story the love between him and Mukami, the older sister of Munira. Mukami's father looked down on Karega because of his brother's involvement with the Mau Mau. Forced to separate, Mariamu and Karega do not see each other again, and Mukami later commits suicide by jumping into a quarry. This {{is the first time}} Munira hears the story. Later, an unknown plane crashes in the village; the only victim is Abdulla's donkey. Wanja notices that there are several large groups of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> to survey the wreckage, and suggests to Abdulla that they begin to sell the Thang'eta drink in Abdulla's bar. The drink attracts notoriety, and many people come to the bar in order to sample it. Out of fury for Karega's connection to his family and jealousy of his relationship with Wanja, Munira schemes to have Karega fired from his teaching post with the school. Karega then leaves Ilmorog.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "old immigrants" [...] of the 1970s, <b>who</b> mainly <b>came</b> to Israel for Zionist feelings, viewed <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>came</b> {{during the}} wave of the 1980s and 1990s as people {{escaping}} a harsh economic situation who did not have much appreciation for their new homeland. The last Soviet census of 1989 indicated 1,449,000 Jews living in the country, of which about 877,000 had moved to Israel by October 2000. The wave of immigration in this short period of time was the greatest influx of people to Israel since the date of its creation. Immigrants from the former Soviet Union composed 50%–70% of the newcomers. The number of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>came</b> to Israel in the late 1980s and early 1990s outnumbered the number of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>came</b> during the 1970s by four times, which made it harder for them to be integrated into the mainstream society of such a small country.|$|R

Robert Rozett, head librarian at Yad Vashem and author of the entry on the [...] "Auschwitz Report" [...] in the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, said of the Vrba controversy in 2005: [...] "There are <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> into the subject from a certain angle and think that they've uncovered the truth.

Williams revealed a section of the lyrics for the song 'Part II' which the winners were able to hear at the listening parties on a LiveJournal post.

[...] He also revealed that some of the original cast will leave as early as 2012: [...] "I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> and go in these teachers' lives." [...] Although four graduating seniors were confirmed in January 2012 as returning in the fourth season—Rachel, Finn, Kurt and Santana—there had been no announcement regarding Quinn or any other seniors as of the end of February 2012.

500|$|Although the Daddies were {{experiencing}} commercial success {{under the guise}} of swing revivalists, having been declared the [...] "leaders" [...] of the movement by Rolling Stone, the band openly contested being labeled a retro act at the exclusion of their dominant ska and punk influences and modernist lyricism. While still vocal supporters of both the swing revival and its bands, the Daddies adamantly tried to disassociate themselves from the swing scene and in particular its nostalgia-based mentality. Perry explained to Spin in July 1998, [...] "it's not our mission to be a swing band. I'm not a guy from the '40s. That's why we play ska and use heavy guitars", noting elsewhere [...] "I can't fully take us out of the retro classification, but we harp on the fact that we're contemporary music". Thusly, the Daddies avoided touring with swing bands, selecting Latin rock group Ozomatli and ska/soul band The Pietasters as support on their first headlining U.S. tour, and opening for Argentine rock band Los Fabulosos Cadillacs on their 1998 North American tour. At one point, the Daddies attempted to arrange a tour with Primus which never materialized; said Perry, [...] "I know there are <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> to our shows who'd like nothing more than for us to play swing 24/7...there are plenty of bands who want to be swing bands and swing bands only. We're trying to find the audience who'll let us write songs and just be who we are".|$|E
