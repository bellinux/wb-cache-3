The definitions of the <b>power</b> <b>components</b> (active, reactive and apparent power, as well as, power factor) under sinusoidal conditions are well accepted among the metering community. But in recent years, due to the increase of non-linear loads, the presence of harmonics in the current and voltage waveforms in the power network has increased notably, and in the future years the presence of harmonics is expected to increase even more. For that reason in many situations, the definitions for sinusoidal conditions are no longer valid. There are no universally accepted definitions for the <b>power</b> <b>components</b> under non-sinusoidal conditions and there is still a discussion on this topic among the experts and a general agreement has not been reached yet. The availability and affordability of the digital technology today has made possible for the utilities to implement new automation systems, which include, among other functions, the remote measurement systems. The new generation of meters is capable of calculating almost any definition for the <b>power</b> <b>components.</b> The problem now is which definitions are going to be implemented. The objective of this document is to review the definitions of <b>power</b> <b>components</b> under sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal conditions, to review the standards for revenue metering including the standardization of the communications architecture, and finally, to analyze and compare the algorithms for the calculation of the <b>power</b> <b>components</b> that are used for revenue metering by simulating them in the MATLAB and SIMULINK environments...|$|R

This method improves the dynamic response of the power sharing control and eliminates the double-frequency oscillation over the voltage and frequency synthesized by the inverter.
