30|$|As {{a variant}} of the {{conventional}} IM problem, Kim and Yoneki [8] introduced the problem called Influential neighbor selection (INS) to select the most influential neighbors of a node, rather than the most influential arbitrary nodes in a network. Kim [10] extended this epidemiological model by introducing several parameters (user propagation weight, content interestingness, and decay factor) to provide a more general and practical information diffusion model. However, they still used synthetic parameters that might significantly affect the information diffusion process. More recently, Kim et al. [10] found that the information diffusion speed of some schemes (e.g., propagation weight and random) in the previous study [17] was quite overestimated.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} the effects of temperature and frequency on the fatigue crack propagation behaviour. The fatigue behaviour at elevated temperature has been reviewed with emphasis on the mechanisms of propagation proposed to explain the effects of temperature and frequency. The crack propagation characteristics of a single crystal superalloy have been investigated at various temperatures and frequencies. Determination of the fatigue crack <b>propagation</b> <b>rates</b> was combined with the measurement of crack tip plastic zone sizes and observation of the deformation behaviour. At elevated temperature, the fatigue crack <b>propagation</b> <b>rates</b> were determined to be dependent on the frequency of loading. At low and high crack growth <b>rates</b> increased crack <b>propagation</b> <b>rates</b> were associated with higher cycling frequencies. At intermediate crack growth <b>rates,</b> the highest <b>propagation</b> <b>rates</b> were associated with the lowest frequency. Selected area channelling pattern techniques were used to determine the plastic zone sizes and revealed that at high frequencies (> 10 Hz) the plastic zone sizes at elevated and ambient temperature are similar. With decreasing frequency at elevated temperature creep may lead to increased plastic zone sizes but may also affect the crack tip geometry thereby restricting further effects. At room temperature crack propagation is observed to occur by shear of the γ' precipitate on { 111 } resulting in { 111 } crystallographic facets on the fracture surface. At elevated temperature (> 6000 C) however, the crack growth mechanism changes and propagation takes place on { 100 }. Observations of the dislocation structure indicate that deformation is concentrated within the γ matrix. It is proposed that the observed crack propagation in the γ matrix on { 100 } arises by the constraints imposed by the surrounding γ' precipitate. A model is presented for the frequency dependence of the intermediate crack growth rate in terms of the observed strain gradients within the plastic zone and the achievement of a critical local fracture strain. </p...|$|R

40|$|Results of a {{study of}} {{heterogeneous}} and homogeneous combustion of metals in reduced gravity are presented. Cylindrical titanium and magnesium samples are radiatively ignited in pure-oxygen at 1 atm. Qualitative observations, <b>propagation</b> <b>rates,</b> and burning times are extracted from high-speed cinematography. Time-resolved emission spectra of gas-phase reactions are acquired with an imaging spectrograph. Lower <b>propagation</b> <b>rates</b> of the reacting mass on titanium and of ignition waves on magnesium are obtained at reduced gravity. These rates are compared to theoretical results from fire-spread analyses with a diffusion/convection controlled reaction. The close agreement found between experimental and theoretical <b>propagation</b> <b>rates</b> indicates the strong influence of natural-convection-enhanced oxygen transp 6 rt on burning rates. Lower oxygen flux and lack of condensed product removal appear {{to be responsible for}} longer burning times of magnesium gas-phase diffusion flames in reduced gravity. Spherically symmetric explosions in magnesium flames at reduced gravity (termed radiation-induced metal explosions, or RIME) may be driven by increased radiation heat transfer from accumulated condensed products to an evaporating metal core covered by a porous, flexible oxide coating. In titanium specimens, predominantly heterogeneous burning characterizes the initial steady propagation of the molten mass, while homogeneous gas-phase reactions are detected around particles ejected from the molten mixture. In magnesium specimens, band and line reversal of all the UV spectral systems of Mg and MgO are attributed to the interaction between small oxide particles and the principal gaseous emitters...|$|R

40|$|Peak {{stress levels}} {{predicted}} in {{finite element analysis}} (FEA) usually depend on mesh density, due to singular points in the model. In an earlier study, an FEA algorithm was developed to simulate the damage accumulation process in the cement mantle around total hip replacement (THR) implants. It allows cement crack formation to be predicted, {{as a function of}} the local cement stress levels. As the simulation is driven by mesh-dependent peak stresses, predicted crack formation rates are also likely to be mesh dependent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mesh dependence of the predicted crack formation process, and to present a method to reduce the mesh dependence. Crack-propagation experiments were simulated. Experimental specimens, representing transverse slices of cemented THR reconstructions, were subjected to cyclic torsional loading. Crack development around the corners of the stem was monitored. The experiments were simulated using three meshes with increasing levels of mesh refinement. Crack locations and orientations were accurately predicted, and were virtually independent of the level of mesh refinement. However, the experimental crack <b>propagation</b> <b>rates</b> were overestimated considerably, increasing with mesh refinement. To eliminate the effect of stress singularities around the corners of the stem, a stress averaging algorithm was applied in the simulation. This algorithm redistributed the stresses by weighted spatial averaging. When damage accumulation was computed based on averaged stresses, the crack <b>propagation</b> <b>rates</b> predicted were independent of the level of mesh refinement. The critical distance, a parameter governing the effect of the averaging algorithm, was optimized such that the predicted crack <b>propagation</b> <b>rates</b> accurately corresponded to the experimental ones.
