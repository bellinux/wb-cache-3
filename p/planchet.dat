5|$|The Susan B. Anthony {{dollar is}} a United States dollar coin minted from 1979 to 1981, when {{the series was}} {{suspended}} due to poor public acceptance, and then again in 1999. Proposed as a smaller replacement for the cumbersome Eisenhower dollar, several shapes and compositions were tested, but all were opposed by the vending machine industry, a powerful lobby affecting coin legislation. Finally, a round <b>planchet</b> with an eleven-sided inner border was chosen for the smaller dollar.|$|E

50|$|Some {{examples}} include cents struck on dime <b>planchets,</b> nickels on cent <b>planchets,</b> or quarters on dime <b>planchets.</b> This type of error {{should not be}} confused with the much rarer mule which is a coin struck between dies that were never intended to be used together such as a coin with nickel obverse and a dime reverse.|$|R
5000|$|Mints {{purchase}} long {{strips of}} metal which are fed through blanking machines that punch out disks known as blank <b>planchets</b> (or simply as <b>planchets</b> or blanks) on which coins are struck. This determines {{the size and}} shape of eventual coins.|$|R
5000|$|A major error {{occurred}} in 2000 when the reverse die of a Sacagawea dollar was {{combined with the}} obverse die of a state quarter on dollar-coin <b>planchets</b> to form {{what is known as}} a [...] "mule". Only eleven of these specimens, produced on dollar <b>planchets,</b> escaped from the mint.|$|R

25|$|On 1 April 1850 {{the auction}} was {{announced}} of equipment from the defunct Soho Mint, created by Matthew Boulton around 1788. At the auction on 29 April Ralph Heaton II bought the four steam-powered screw presses and six <b>planchet</b> presses for making blanks from strip metal. These were {{installed at the}} Bath Street works, and in that year trade tokens were struck for use in Australia. In 1851 coins were struck for Chile using the letter H as a mintmark. The same year copper planchets were made for the Royal Mint to make into pennies, halfpennies, farthings, half-farthings and quarter-farthings. In 1852 the Mint won a contract to produce {{a new series of}} coins for France. In this the Mint pioneered the minting of bronze. Ralph Heaton III (son of Ralph II) took key workers to Marseilles to equip and operate the French mint there, staying to fulfil the contract, and producing 750 tons of Napoléon III bronze coins from 1853 to 1857.|$|E
500|$|... 1904: The <b>planchet</b> of the Army {{version of}} the Medal of Honor was {{redesigned}} by General George Lewis Gillespie. The purpose of the redesign was to help distinguish the Medal of Honor from other medals, particularly the membership insignia issued by the Grand Army of the Republic.|$|E
500|$|In 1974 {{and again}} in 1977, the Denver Mint struck {{a small number of}} pieces on silver-clad <b>planchets,</b> or blanks. Both times, these came from <b>planchets</b> which had been shipped from the San Francisco Assay Office to Denver. The first ones in 1974 were found {{independently}} by two Las Vegas blackjack dealers. The 1974 <b>planchets</b> were initially intended to be used for [...] "brown Ike" [...] proof strikings; Mint policy then was that rejected silver proof <b>planchets</b> were to be used for uncirculated [...] "blue Ikes", but these were placed in the bin for rejected copper-nickel proof <b>planchets,</b> intended to be shipped to be coined for circulation at Denver. The 1977 pieces resulted from pieces rejected for Bicentennial silver proof use, which were again placed in the wrong bin (they should have been melted, as the Mint was no longer striking silver uncirculated Eisenhower dollars). Between 10 and 20 of each date are known. Wexler, Crawford, and Flynn report an even rarer 1776–1976-D dollar in silver, but state that none have been offered at auction or submitted to the major coin grading services.|$|R
2500|$|A major error {{occurred}} in 2000 when the reverse die of a Sacagawea dollar was {{combined with the}} obverse die of a state quarter on dollar-coin <b>planchets</b> to form {{what is known as}} a [...] "mule".

500|$|Some sources {{suggest that}} Longacre may have based the {{features}} of Liberty on those of his daughter, Sarah. [...] This story would be more often associated with Longacre's Indian Head cent, but {{the features of}} Liberty on both coins (and also the Type I gold dollar, the double eagle, and the three-cent nickel piece) are nearly identical. To help distinguish the new coin from the quarter eagle or $2.50piece, Longacre used a thinner <b>planchet,</b> or blank, to make the piece greater in diameter. [...] He also flattened the <b>planchet</b> of the gold dollar to enlarge it, and gave it the same Indian princess design. [...] The reverse originates Longacre's [...] "agricultural wreath" [...] of corn, tobacco, cotton, and wheat which would also appear on the gold dollar, Flying Eagle cent, and his revised reverse for the Seated Liberty dime and half dime. [...] This blended the produce of the South and North {{at a time of}} intersectional tension. Numismatist Walter Hagans deems the wreathed reverse [...] "as uniquely American as is the Indian maiden on the obverse." ...|$|E
500|$|Numismatists Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, {{in their}} {{encyclopedia}} of early commemoratives, {{suggested that the}} [...] "flawed" [...] first specimen was not destroyed, but was given to Ellsworth, a noted coin collector who possessed rarities such as the Brasher doubloon and two specimens of the 1804 dollar. They deemed it unlikely that experienced Mint workers would have selected a flawed <b>planchet</b> {{to use in the}} first strike, and that Ellsworth obtained the piece with Bosbyshell's agreement.|$|E
500|$|In 1851, Congress had {{authorized}} {{a silver}} three-cent piece so that postage stamps of that value could be purchased without using the widely disliked copper cents. [...] Two years later, a bill was passed which authorized a three-dollar coin. [...] By some accounts, the coin was created so larger quantities of stamps could be purchased. [...] Longacre, {{in designing the}} piece, sought {{to make it as}} different as possible from the quarter eagle or $2.50 piece, striking it on a thinner <b>planchet</b> and using a distinctive design.|$|E

500|$|In 1853, Congress {{authorized}} a three-dollar piece. In a note {{found among}} his papers, Longacre wrote that his {{task was to}} make the coin as easy as possible to distinguish from the quarter eagle, which at $2.50 was close in value. Longacre produced a design for a Native American princess, which he made different from Gobrecht's Liberty design on the quarter eagle with a thinner and wider <b>planchet.</b> [...] At the time, a female Native American was often used to represent America in art, and a depiction of Liberty as an Indian princess was in accord with contemporary practices. The chief engraver wrote to Mint Director Snowden that the three-dollar piece, which went into production in 1854, {{was the first time he}} had been allowed artistic freedom in designing a coin. [...] The gold dollar was altered the same year to make the <b>planchet</b> both thinner and wider; Longacre modified his princess design for the gold dollar. [...] For the reverse of the coins, Longacre created a wreath of wheat, corn, tobacco, and cotton, blending the agricultural products of the North and the South. [...] This wreath would also be used on the reverse of the Flying Eagle cent in 1856; reused on the dime beginning in 1860, the [...] "cereal wreath" [...] would be Longacre's last surviving design on coinage, remaining with modifications until the 1916 abandonment of the Barber dime.|$|E
500|$|In 1907, the Mint had experimented by {{striking}} {{about two dozen}} pieces of the same weight as the double eagle, bearing Saint-Gaudens's design, but which had a smaller, thicker <b>planchet.</b> [...] These [...] "checker" [...] pieces were destroyed (except two placed in the Mint's coin collection) when {{it was discovered that}} the consent of Congress was needed to change the diameter of any coin. [...] In 2009, the Mint struck a similar piece in [...]999 gold, using Saint-Gaudens's original ultra high relief design for both sides of the coin, though modified to a 50-star obverse. [...] These pieces contain one ounce of gold, slightly more than the original double eagle.|$|E
500|$|Six {{thousand}} silver medals on a thin (1.6mm) <b>planchet</b> {{were struck}} between May 21 and 23, 1925, at the Philadelphia Mint. They were handled like ordinary coins: They were counted, bagged, and {{transported to the}} Fourth Street National Bank of Philadelphia for the centennial commission's use. Between May 29 and June 13, a total of 33,750 pieces were struck on a thick (2mm) silver <b>planchet.</b> The reason for the two varieties is uncertain; Swiatek theorizes that the Norse-American Centennial Commission might not have liked how the thin ones looked, or might have wanted collectors to buy two medals. One hundred were struck in gold, on June 3 and 4—Kvale received the second one struck. The medals cost the commission 30 cents each for the thin ones, 45 cents for the thick, and $10.14 for the gold. The retail price of the thin ones is uncertain (Swiatek estimates $1.75), the thick ones {{are known to have}} cost $1.25, and the gold pieces about $20. They were sold by mail order; none were sold at the celebrations or in person. There was a sales limit of one per person, but purchasers could buy on behalf of as many family members as they wanted. The thin pieces were not offered for sale until November or December 1925, and sold mostly to numismatists—the commission's secretary, J.A. Horvik, was frustrated that more [...] "Norsemen" [...] were not buying the medal. After the celebrations, Kvale took 5,000 medals to New York, hoping to sell them, but was not successful. Of the 100 gold pieces struck, 47 were eventually returned to the Treasury when they could not be sold, and some of the silver pieces (most likely thick ones) were as well.|$|E
5000|$|The 2 franc coin was minted by the United States in 1944 in {{preparation}} for the Allied liberation of Belgium. An Allied Occupation Issue, this coin was made with the blank <b>planchets</b> of the 1943 steel Wheat penny. [...] Some of these coins have a slightly different weight, and thus their blank <b>planchets</b> would have been specifically made for this foreign denomination.|$|R
25|$|In {{an error}} {{similar to the}} 1943 cents, a few 1944 cents were struck on steel <b>planchets</b> left over from 1943. There are two {{explanations}} given for why this happened. One explanation is that steel <b>planchets</b> were left in the press hopper and press machines {{from the previous year}} mixed in with copper <b>planchets.</b> Another explanation credits the error to the production of 25 million Belgian two franc pieces by the Philadelphia mint after that country's liberation from the Nazis. These coins were of the same composition and the same <b>planchets</b> as the 1943 cents, but they differed slightly in weight. In all, 1944 steel cents are fewer in number than their 1943 copper counterparts, and are even more valuable; one such example minted in San Francisco sold for $373,750 in an August 2008 auction held by Heritage Auctions; this was the highest auction price ever for a Lincoln cent until September 23, 2010, when it was superseded by a 1943-D bronze penny.|$|R

500|$|The new coins proved {{difficult}} to produce; {{owing to the}} hardness of the <b>planchet,</b> the coins were not of high quality {{and the life of}} the striking dies was brief. The design was widely criticized; Wharton described the obverse as suggesting [...] "a tombstone surmounted by a cross and overhung by weeping willows." [...] The American Journal of Numismatics described the Shield nickel as [...] "the ugliest of all known coins". The rays were eliminated from the reverse design in 1867, in the hope of eliminating some of the production problems. The design change created confusion among the population—many people assumed that one design or the other was a counterfeit—and the Mint briefly considered abandoning the shield design entirely. After heavy production in its first years, by late 1869, enough nickels had been struck {{to meet the needs of}} commerce; fewer were coined in the following years.|$|E
500|$|As a boy, {{inventor}} George Escol Sellers knew Eckfeldt; as Sellers's {{father was}} {{partner in a}} firm which sold machinery to the Mint Bureau, Eckfeldt often dined at his house. [...] In the final years both of the 19th century and of Sellers's life, he published his memoirs, including memories of the first Philadelphia Mint. [...] He recalled in 1812 peering through a window to see cents coined, and Eckfeldt coming into the room to stop the work {{at the end of}} the day. [...] Seeing the young Sellers, he had the boy come in, had him place a cent <b>planchet</b> on the press, and struck it for him. [...] Sellers nearly dropped it because it was so hot, and Eckfeldt reminded him it had been cold when placed in the press. Eckfeldt bade him keep the coin until he learned why the cent had become hot, and then he could spend it on candy.|$|E

The design of the coins was widely criticized, with Wharton describing the shield design as suggesting [...] "a tombstone surmounted by a cross and overhung by weeping willows."

More seriously, the reverse design reminded many of the [...] "stars and bars" [...] motif of the defeated Confederate States. The rays were eliminated from the design in early 1867, in the hopes of eliminating some of the production problems. The transition to the new design was to occur on February 1, 1867, but it is likely the mint used up the remaining dies with the old design in the interest of economy. The design change created confusion among the population, with many people assuming one design or the other was a counterfeit, and the Mint considered abandoning the shield design entirely.|$|E
50|$|Between the 2015-16 {{financial}} year 2.4 billion coins and <b>planchets</b> were minted {{for the international}} market and 2,007 million for the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|A uni-face coin {{results when}} two <b>planchets</b> are stacked one atop {{the other at}} the time of striking. This {{produces}} two coins: one with only an obverse image, and a second with only the reverse image. The <b>planchets</b> may be centered over the die producing one complete image on each coin or off-centered producing partial images on each side. In the accompanying image of the blank reverse, the shadow or outline of Lincoln's profile from the obverse side of the coin is visible.|$|R

2500|$|A coin struck on a <b>planchet</b> that {{is thicker}} than normal, {{typically}} twice as thick. [...] "Piefort" [...] {{is a common}} misspelling.|$|E
2500|$|When a coin is struck, the <b>planchet</b> is not heated. Although the <b>planchet</b> {{would be}} softer and more malleable, {{the extra time}} and expense would prove too great for the Mint. The <b>planchet</b> is {{therefore}} struck at room temperature, {{and the only thing}} which makes the coin form is the tremendous pressure used to strike it. With a metal such as nickel, which is harder than a normal coin metal like silver, gold or copper, the pressure must be greater. When a nickel coin, or any coin, is struck, the metal must [...] "flow" [...] into the contours of the front and back dies. It is through the atoms of the metal flowing into the dies that flow lines are created. However, when metal flows over a sharp corner in the die, like the edges of a mintmark or words, it tends to roll the detail out. It wears on the die, and a little detail is lost with every strike. Die Deterioration Doubling is most prevalent on the date and mintmark because these fine details are alone {{in the middle of the}} field, and the metal must flow into these without the help of other valleys nearby. When the metal rolls into the mintmark or date, it wears away the corner of the die, and after long enough will appear on the coin as Die Deterioration Doubling.|$|E
2500|$|Caused when a coin <b>planchet</b> {{fails to}} be placed between two dies during the minting process, causing the dies to smash together. The design of one or both may impress into the {{opposite}} die, causing a [...] "shadow" [...] of the design to appear on subsequent coins minted with the damaged dies. The impact of the two dies may also result in die cracks or defects.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the coins}} could be struck, the edge {{lettering}} and devices {{had to be}} impressed {{on the edge of}} the <b>planchets.</b> This action was performed with a device known as the Castaing machine; the machine stamped the edge with the words [...] "Hundred Cents One Dollar or Unit" [...] along with ornamentation. As production was inexact, many <b>planchets</b> intended for silver dollars were overweight. This was remedied by filing the face of the planchets; for this reason, the coins vary in weight more dramatically than later issues, which were minted with more precise equipment.|$|R
25|$|The {{quality of}} the strike is {{exceptionally}} sharp, especially around the rim, because the soft copper <b>planchets</b> were struck with the same (higher) pressure used for the steel cents.|$|R
500|$|In May 2000, {{an error}} coin bearing the George Washington obverse {{design of a}} U.S. state quarter and the eagle reverse of a Sacagawea dollar was {{discovered}} in a roll of dollar coins purchased from a bank in Mountain Home, Arkansas. [...] The undated coin, known as a double-denomination mule, {{was the first of}} eleven discovered and authenticated. Mint officials estimate that the coins, which bear the 'P' mint mark for Philadelphia, were struck from late April to early May 2000. [...] They were produced on dollar-coin <b>planchets</b> clad with manganese bronze, not quarter <b>planchets</b> with copper-nickel cladding.|$|R
