5000|$|Mercantilism {{developed}} {{at a time}} of transition for the European economy. Isolated feudal estates were being replaced by centralized nation-states as the focus of power. Technological changes in shipping and the growth of urban centres led to a rapid increase in international trade. Mercantilism focused on how this trade could best aid the states. Another important change was the introduction of double-entry bookkeeping and modern accounting. This accounting made extremely clear the inflow and outflow of trade, contributing to the close scrutiny given to the balance of trade. Of course, the impact of the discovery of America cannot be ignored. New markets and new <b>mines</b> <b>propelled</b> foreign trade to previously inconceivable volumes, resulting in [...] "the great upward movement in prices" [...] and an increase in [...] "the volume of merchant activity itself".|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. After several decades of economic decline, mining's growing importance in many African economies has been welcomed, but {{the rate of}} sectoral transformation from rural agrarian to more urbanised mining economies, has not afforded sufficient time for policymakers to fully appreciate {{the nature of the}} developmental processes underway. This study focuses on the economic, social and cultural change associated with rapid and/or erratic rates of urban growth <b>propelled</b> by <b>mining</b> expansion in three contrasting countries: Angola (diamonds) Ghana (gold) Tanzania (gold/diamonds) As a prelude to field studies, an international conference will be held to overview the impact of mining on urbanisation in Africa's major emergent mining economies. Phase 2 encompasses key informant interviews, focus group discussions and surveys in small and large-scale mining settlements to probe miners' migration, earnings, work and living conditions. Phase 3 involves interviews with national policymakers about their perceptions of mining's influence on urbanization and poverty. Phase 4 concentrates on dissemination of research findings. A 'Digging Deeper' participatory programme involving youth groups expressing their perceptions of life in mining settlements in various art forms explores the local population's consciousness of their cultural and social identity transformation. The overall aim is to disseminate knowledge of actual as opposed to rumoured outcomes of mining livelihoods to facilitate the formulation of policies tailored to current realities...|$|R
40|$|Deep-space {{travel is}} limited by the costly voyage to leave Earth's {{atmosphere}} and gravitational pull. The volume of propellants per unit mass of the payload required for that segment constrains the payload size and payload destination. To circumvent that limitation, this paper presents the feasibility of a refueling station using Lunar resources, called Lunarport. On Earth's moon, an unmanned station will robotically mine, produce, and store fuel and oxidizer from water ice at the poles. A first-stage-like rocket, called the Lunar Resupply Shuttle (LRS), stationed there and <b>propelled</b> with <b>mined</b> resources, will launch and dock with a passing payload-carrying rocket. That rocket will be reloaded with propellants by the LRS, after which the LRS will detach and the payload-carrying rocket will continue its journey to its desired trajectory. The LRS will wait in Lower Lunar Orbit (LLO, to avoid deterioration from Lunar regolith) until another payload-carrying rocket is launched from Earth, after which, the LRS will land back on the Moon, reload propellants, and launch again to dock with the next rocket. This paper elaborates on Lunarport, presenting proof-of-concept calculations of the increase in payload size sent to various payload destinations as well as a cost-benefit analysis. By way of example, NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) en-route to Mars that refuels at Lunarport can have a payload approximately 17 metric tons (mT) heavier than one traveling straight to Mars from Earth. This increase of more than 50 % [1] is just to a relatively nearby planet — Mars. Sending a payload farther offers larger benefits with Lunarport. Wear-and-tear issues the port will be subjected to are also discussed. A full analysis of Lunarport will be done during the 2017 Caltech Space Challenge sponsored by Airbus Defence and Space held from March 26 – 31, 2017...|$|R
40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} multi length scale modeling of polymer matrix composites reinforced with high specific strength, high specific stiffness continuous aramid fibers. These composite materials are commonly used in various light weight protective systems the main requirement {{of which is a}} high level of penetration resistance against high kinetic energy projectiles (e. g. bullets, exploded <b>mine</b> <b>propelled</b> soil ejecta, fragments of improvised explosive devices, turbine blades, etc.). Within the proposed multi length scale modeling approach, the following distinct length scales have been identified and their respective mechanical constitutive relations derived and parameterized: (a) molecular chain; (b) fibril; (c) fiber; (d) yarn; (e) fabric/ply; (f) single lamina; (g) stacked lamina; and (h) laminate. In addition, issues related to identification of the type and the extent of data generated at a finer length scale to the adjacent coarser length scale, as well as seamless integration of different length scales into a unified material model, are addressed. Finally, results are presented pertaining to the implementation of the multi scale material model into a transient, nonlinear dynamics/finite element analysis of a few simplified ballistic impact scenarios. 1...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Botswana, {{which is}} widely {{known for its}} {{remarkable}} economic growth and prudent macro-economic management, {{was one of the}} poorest countries in the world prior to independence in 1966. The country was primarily a subsistence economy largely founded on agriculture, with a modicum of tourism. However, Botswana has since experienced rapid economic growth. This growth has been <b>propelled</b> by the <b>mining</b> sector, particularly the diamond industry. The reliance of Botswana on a single commodity has prompted the government to engage in efforts to diversify the economy. This objective has been an important thread in the country's economic policy since the 1980 's and forms the key theme of recent national development plans. Due to a small domestic market, Botswana has embarked on a strategy to promote export orientated companies and the facilitation of Foreign Direct Investment, (FDI). Manufacturing, which is our primary focus, has been identified as a possible vehicle for economic growth and diversification, {{due to the fact that}} certain subsectors are labour intensive and could alleviate the country's pressing employment problem. We conducted a survey of fifteen manufacturing firms with the research objective of capturing their views on Botswana as an investment environment, the level of incentives, economic diversification and other related issues. The field research was based on individual interviews using a questionnaire. We argue that factors, which previous studies identified as impediments to investment in the manufacturing sector, have largely been addressed. However, we concur that investment into this sector has not been as high as expected. Although incentive programmes have been established to promote investment, particularly into the manufacturing sector, research on the effectiveness of incentives is inconclusive. We argue that these incentives have to be retained in their current form. In neighbouring countries the development of the manufacturing sector has frequently necessitated the establishment of Export Processing Zones (EPZs). EPZs have found support from institutions such as the World Bank. which regards them as a powerful signal of a country's departure from import substitution to being an export-orientated economy. It is this paper's contention that the establishment of an EPZ is not the best policy option for Botswana. We argue that the objectives of diversification can best be achieved through a multi-tiered investment promotion strategy that will raise awareness of Botswana as an investment destination, facilitate the entry of foreign firms into the country, and identify valuable projects. The investment promotion strategy should seek to raise awareness of Botswana as a preferred investment destination...|$|R
5000|$|Rank and organization: Captain, U.S. Army, Company D, 3d Battalion. 187th Infantry, 3d Brigade, 101st Airborne Division. Place and date: Near Phuoc Vinh, Binh Duong Province, Republic of Vietnam, 16- March 19, 1968. Entered service at: U [...]S. Military Academy, West Point, N.Y. Born: August 1, 1943, Washington, D.C.For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{at the risk of}} his life above and beyond the call of duty. Capt. Bucha distinguished himself while serving as commanding officer, Company D, on a reconnaissance-in-force mission against enemy forces near Phuoc Vinh. The company was inserted by helicopter into the suspected enemy stronghold to locate and destroy the enemy. During this period Capt. Bucha aggressively and courageously led his men in the destruction of enemy fortifications and base areas and eliminated scattered resistance impeding the advance of the company. On 18 March while advancing to contact, the lead elements of the company became engaged by the heavy automatic weapon, heavy machine gun, rocket <b>propelled</b> grenade, Claymore <b>mine</b> and small-arms fire of an estimated battalion-size force. Capt. Bucha, with complete disregard for his safety, moved to the threatened area to direct the defense and ordered reinforcements to the aid of the lead element. Seeing that his men were pinned down by heavy machine gun fire from a concealed bunker located some 40 meters {{to the front of the}} positions, Capt. Bucha crawled through the hail of fire to single-handedly destroy the bunker with grenades. During this heroic action Capt. Bucha received a painful shrapnel wound. Returning to the perimeter, he observed that his unit could not hold its positions and repel the human wave assaults launched by the determined enemy. Capt. Bucha ordered the withdrawal of the unit elements and covered the withdrawal to positions of a company perimeter from which he could direct fire upon the charging enemy. When 1 friendly element retrieving casualties was ambushed and cut off from the perimeter, Capt. Bucha ordered them to feign death and he directed artillery fire around them. During the night Capt. Bucha moved throughout the position, distributing ammunition, providing encouragement and insuring the integrity of the defense. He directed artillery, helicopter gunship and Air Force gunship fire on the enemy strong points and attacking forces, marking the positions with smoke grenades. Using flashlights in complete view of enemy snipers, he directed the medical evacuation of 3 air-ambulance loads of seriously wounded personnel and the helicopter supply of his company. At daybreak Capt. Bucha led a rescue party to recover the dead and wounded members of the ambushed element. During the period of intensive combat, Capt. Bucha, by his extraordinary heroism, inspirational example, outstanding leadership and professional competence, led his company in the decimation of a superior enemy force which left 156 dead on the battlefield. His bravery and gallantry at the risk of his life are in the highest traditions of the military service, Capt. Bucha has reflected great credit on himself, his unit, and the U.S. Army.|$|R
