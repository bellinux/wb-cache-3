25|$|The hairy rove beetle is {{considered}} beneficial {{in the environment}} {{because it is a}} successful scavenger and predator. However, infestation of houses has been reported by this beetle. A reason why C. maxillosus infests houses is not known for certain, but a study of rearing this beetle in the laboratory has shown that adults like to lay eggs in fresh sand and not sand that is old or contaminated. To solve the problem of infestation certain pesticides have been found to affect the adults and larvae of this beetle and can be used to control their numbers. Atroban, a chemical pesticide composed of permethrin (0.05%), decreases the number of adults and larvae of the family Staphylinidae. Short term reductions of this family were caused by a chemical named demethoate (0.05%). Both of these pesticides were tested on moist spots on <b>poultry</b> <b>dung.</b>|$|E

The setup was performed as a batch process at an average ambient temperature of 29 ± 2 0 C and a retention time of 15 days. Comparisons were made with two other experiments which were both begun at ambient atmospheric pressure; one was inoculated with digestate from a previous layer-hen dung AD, while the other was not inoculated. The bioreactors initiated at sub-atmospheric pressure, ambient atmospheric pressure without inoculum, and ambient atmospheric pressure with inoculum showed the following for biogas and biomethane yields respectively: 16. 8 cm 3 g- 1 VS and 15. 46 cm 3 g 1 VS, 25. 10 cm 3 g- 1 VS and 12. 85 cm 3 g- 1 VS, 21. 44 cm 3 g- 1 VS and 14. 88 cm 3 g 1 VS.

The feedstock showed values of 83. 93 % and 3. 98 x 106 cfu mL- 1 for volatile solids and total viable count respectively. There was a slight difference in the volatile solids of the digestates of the three bioreactors after AD. The pH recorded for the feedstock slurry before AD was 7. 9 at 30 oC, while after AD, the digestates from all the three bioreactors showed the same pH of 5. 9 at 29 0 C. Statistical analysis using ANOVA showed {{no significant difference in}} biogas yields of the feedstock for the three bioreactors (A, B, C). ANOVA showed no significant difference for biomethane yields in the bioreactors initiated at sub-atmospheric pressure and for those initiated at ambient atmospheric pressure with inoculums. However, it showed significant difference in the bioreactor initiated at sub-atmospheric pressure and that initiated at ambient atmospheric pressure without inoculums, and significant difference in the two sets of bioreactors initiated at ambient atmospheric pressure (with and without inoculum). Initiating AD at reduced atmospheric pressure (- 30 cmHg) and the addition of inoculum at ambient atmospheric pressure both increased biomethanation, by 20. 31 % and 15. 80 % respectively. The AD initiated at sub-atmospheric pressure yielded the least amount of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas), and improved biodegradation and biomethanation. The results also suggest that biomethane production is dependent on specific methanogenic growth. Analyzing the populations of methanogens isolated from the different bioreactors in relation to their biomethane yields suggests that Methanosarcina barkeri may have been largely responsible for the differences in biomethane yields...|$|E

Biogas can be used for all applications designed for natural gas, assuming sufficient purification. ie: by extraction and separation of these impurities by scrubbing process, we can purify and enrich the percentage of CH 4 in raw biogas make its compression and bottling enable. Biogas can be converted in bio CNG after enrichment and bottling LBG, it becomes just like CNG...|$|R
40|$|Pot {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} the year 2010 and repeated in 2011 to examine the eff ects of organic manure (<b>poultry,</b> cow <b>dung,</b> domestic waste) and inorganic manure (NPK 15 : 15 : 15) on the yield, soil and root population of Meloidogyne incognita that infected Ethiopian eggplant Solanum aethiopicum in a greenhouse at Kabba College of Agriculture, Ahmadu Bello University, Kabba, Nigeria. Each of the organic manure was applied as soil amendment {{at the rate of}} 5 t/ha and the inorganic fertilizer (NPK) was applied at the rate of 200 kg/ha while there was an untreated control that acted as standard check. Th e experimental design was a completely randomized design comprising of fi ve treatments including control and each of the treatments was replicated four times. Th e results of the experiment showed that all the organic manures considered and NPK fertilizer were eff ective in suppressing nematode negative eff ects on the plant as manifested in improved yield, reduced soil and root population as well as in reduced gall index of the organic and inorganic manure treated plants compared with the control. Th e mean fruit yield of the manure treated plant was 18 + 1, of NPK fertilizer treated ones was 17, while the average fruit number in untreated control was 6. 5. Th e organic and inorganic manures treated plants had bigger fruit size compared with control and were signifi cantly diff erent from the control. Th e soil and root population as well as root gall index were reduced in all the manure treatments compared with the control and they were signifi cantly diff erent from the control.

40|$|The {{effects of}} poultry manure and cow dung in {{comparison}} with the nematicide, carbofuran on the yield of okra infested with root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita Race 2 were investigated. Two plots of 17 × 11 m, each naturally infested with the mentioned nematode, were selected for the study. Treatments were poultry manure and cow dung each at the rates of 5 and 10 t ha- 1, carbofuran 3 G at the rates of 1. 5 and 3. 0 kg ai ha- 1, and a control. One week after application, okra seeds were sown at two seeds per hole and thinned to one plant, one week after planting. Number of pods, cumulative weight of okra pods, root gall-index, soil chemical properties, and soil nematode densities in soil were determined {{at the beginning and end}} of the study. The results showed that the highest rates of <b>poultry</b> manure, cow <b>dung,</b> and carbofuran significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) reduced root gall-index and nematode population density in soil and correspondingly increased fruit yield in comparison to those at lower rates and the control. The results of this study suggest that incorporation of poultry manure or cow dung in nematode-infested field has the potentials to suppress nematode population and reduce nematode damage on okra...|$|R
40|$|Studies on {{the effects}} of some organic manure types on plantparasitic {{nematode}} (Meloidogyne incognita) of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) was conducted at Kabba College of Agriculture, Ahmadu Bello University, Kogi State, Nigeria in the year 2008 and repeated in 2009. The organic manure types (<b>poultry</b> manure, cow <b>dung,</b> compost and domestic waste) were applied as soil amendment and were incorporated into the soil at the rate of 5 tons per hectare while there was an untreated control treatment that acted as standard check. The experiment design was complete randomization comprising of five treatments and each treatment was replicated 4 times. The result of the experiment shows that all the organic manures types were effective in reducing the population of root- knot nematodes with resultant increase in growth and yield of tomato. Poultry manure is more effective than other organic manures with respect to the tested parameters. There were significant differences between the various treatments and all the treatments were significantly different from the control with respect to the tested parameters. The result of this experiment confirmed organic manure as an effective farm input for managing M. incognita in all endemic areas with a resultant increase in the growth and yield of the plant...|$|R
40|$|Poultry litter (a {{mixture of}} rice hulls, sawdust and chicken excreta of broilers) {{mixed with the}} co-substrate cow <b>dung</b> and <b>poultry</b> {{droppings}} was evaluated under anaerobic conditions {{for the production of}} biogas (methane). Four laboratory scale reactors, R 1, R 2, R 3 and R 4, were set up with different proportions of waste <b>poultry</b> litter, cow <b>dung</b> and <b>poultry</b> droppings and had a 6 % total solid concentration. Digestion was carried out for 50 days at room temperature, 32  ±  3  °C. Volatile solid degradation and specific gas production in the four reactors was 46 %, 51. 99 %, 51. 96 %, 43 % and 0. 263, 0. 469, 0. 419, 0. 221  l/g, respectively, based on the volatile solid (VS) feed. The methane yields were 71 %, 72. 5 %, 72. 6 % and 70 %, respectively. The COD reductions were 46. 1 %, 50. 76 %, 48. 23 % and 45. 12 %, respectively. A kinetic analysis showed that the anaerobic digestion of poultry litter with a co-substrate followed first order kinetics. Among the experimental reactors, R 2 (25 % cow <b>dung,</b> 75 % <b>poultry</b> litter) gave the optimum results: a VS reduction of 51. 99 %, a specific gas yield of 0. 469  l/g and a methane yield of 72. 5 %...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the effect of rice straw, Sesbania, mungbean residue, <b>poultry</b> manure and <b>dung</b> manure coupled with 30 % or 50 % reduction of the recommended NPKS fertilizers (100 %) on crops in a T. Aman (autmn) -Boro (winter) rice cropping sequence at two locations of Bangladesh over three years (1998 - 2001). The experiment was {{laid out in a}} randomized complete block design with three replications. Each year, organic manure and crop residues were applied to T. Aman rice (1 st crop) and the residual effect was evaluated on Boro rice (2 crop). Effectiveness of different manures and crop residues with respect to crop yields followed the order of poultry manure (3 t ha) > mungbean residues (10 t ha) > Sesbania (15 t ha) > dung manure (5 t ha) > rice straw (5 t ha). An application of 70 % NPKS fertilizers plus 3 t ha poultry manure gave the highest grain yield which was identical to 100 % NPKS fertilizers with no use of manure or crop residues. The same treatment resulted in the highest N, P, K and S uptake by the crops. The lowest crop yield was always recorded in unfertilized control plots. An appreciable increase in soil organic matter was observed due to combined use of fertilizer and manure...|$|R
30|$|Table 4 shows {{results of}} the effect of {{application}} of agricultural wastes and NPK fertilizer on seed weight per plant, 100 -seed weight, number of seeds per cob, and grain yield. The results show that there were significant differences in the values of these parameters under combined application of agricultural wastes and NPK fertilizer. Generally, grain weight per plant, 100 -seed weight, number of seeds per cob, and grain yield increased in organically amended plots (treated with Chromolaena, Parkia, neem seed cake, cow <b>dung,</b> <b>poultry</b> manure, and melon shell) and wastes combined with reduce level of NPK compared with the unamended (control) plot. In Table 3, it is also shown that the plots treated with combined application of organic residues (7 t/ha) + NPK 120 kg/ha produced highest seed weight per plant, 100 -seed weight, and number of seeds per cob when compared with plots where agricultural wastes alone (10 t/ha) were applied. Combined use of poultry manure and NPK fertilizer recorded the highest seed weight and number of seed per cob which were statistically better than when NPK fertilizer was applied at a recommended rate (400 kg/ha). The unamended (control) plot, however, produced the least value of seed weight, 100 -seed weight, number of seed per cob, and grain yield. The combined application of agricultural wastes and NPK fertilizer improved the grain yield of maize as indicated by the increase in seed weight per plant, 100 -seed weight, number of seed per cob, and seed yield.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} nutrient contents of some selected organic materials within Sokoto metropolis. The organic materials sampled included; neem leaves, neem seeds, <b>poultry</b> manure, sheep <b>dung,</b> cow dung, refuse dump, millet husk, wood ash and rice husk. The samples were collected in three replicates from different locations, making a total of 27 samples. These samples were air-dried, gentle crushed and sieved through 2 mm sieve mesh. The following chemical properties of the samples were analyzed using standard methods; pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, exchangeable bases (Ca, Mg, Na, and K) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) and percentage base saturation (PBS) was also calculated. The result showed that the pH value ranged from 5. 4 (neem seeds) to 7. 54 (sheep dung). The organic matter content ranged from 2. 03 % in neem leaves to 22. 05 % in sheep dung, sodium ranged from 0. 39 cmol/kg in millet husk to 7. 10 cmol/kg in refuse dump, total nitrogen values ranged from 0. 30 % in wood ash to 1. 42 % in poultry manure.
