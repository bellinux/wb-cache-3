40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from February 5, 2016 - August 5, 2016 As the forest industry moves toward the use of younger trees and production of {{an increasing number of}} composite products improving durability has gained importance. Coatings {{are one of the most}} widely used methods for improving wood durability because they improve resistance to water penetration, and subsequent shrinking and swelling, which improves performance. From a wood panel manufacturing perspective, the hot-press may offer an opportunity to use in-situ wood chemistry reactions to chemically modify just the wood surface, decreasing the level of hydroxyl species in the weak boundary layer, improving moisture resistance, and reducing the need to apply a coating. This research focused on establishing whether or not wood surface chemistry and performance could be effected by hot <b>press</b> <b>platen</b> metallurgy under hot pressing conditions and if so, to determine if these effects were due to thermo-mechanical or chemical changes. The significance of chemical changes and their characterization was investigated. In addition, this research also sought to contribute to fundamental knowledge in the area of metal mechanochemical modifications of wood and other renewable materials under normal wood composite processing conditions. Results confirmed at a high level that different press surfaces do indeed support statistically significant differences in wood surface chemistry. FTIR -ATR analysis showed consistent differences in the surface chemistry between different platen metal types at changing process conditions. DART-TOF-MS analysis showed that statistically significant concentrations of platen specific wood surface ion species could be identified. FTIR microscopy diffuse reflection analysis supported that organic residues present on a platen surface after pressing are at least somewhat specific to the platen metallurgy. Some statistically significant relationships between water permeance and diffusion performance and hot <b>press</b> <b>platen</b> metallurgy were also established. RSM models in combination with ANOVA, Tukey, and Correlation analysis suggest that thermal and mechanical effects are likely more important than chemical catalytic effects in terms of moisture resistance, but that chemical effects do play a role. Improvements in water resistance imparted by different pressing surfaces were notable, but not as significant as conventional paint coatings. A platen-wood surface relationship appears to exist and if platen metal selection can be used to slow or advance reactions that lead to more rapid or higher production of desired chemical traits, this area of study may possibly have important implications for a variety of wood product applications...|$|E

40|$|A new testing technique, named Double-Edge Wedge Splitting Test (DEWST), for {{determining}} the direct tensile strength of quasi-brittle materials – such as concrete – has been recently developed at the Politecnico di Milano. The principal aim is to simplify the loading device and the test set-up generally used in direct-tension tests: for example, the specimens need not to be glued to the <b>press</b> <b>platens.</b> Moreover, the crack pattern observed in a few preliminary tests is regular, and cracking can be easily controlled via the stroke of the loading machine. The present work aims to investigate the possibility of applying such technique to cha-racterize thermally-damaged plain concrete specimens. Three different concretes were considered (fc = 50, 80 and 90 MPa) {{and the results are}} compared to those obtained by means of traditional and well-defined tech-niques (splitting tests on cylinders, four-point bending displacement-controlled tests on prisms), in order to highlight {{the pros and cons of}} the proposed technique...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{numerical}} {{solution for the}} mathematical modeling of the hot-pressing process applied to medium density fiberboard. The model {{is based on the}} work of Humphrey (1982), Humphrey and Bolton (1989), and Carvalho and Costa (1998) with some modifications and extensions in order to take into account mainly the convective effects on the phase change term and also a conservative numerical treatment of the resulting system of partial differential equations. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 65 M 60, 82 C 70, 76 S 05, 76 T 30. 1. Hot-pressing mathematical model. Hot pressing is the process in which a mat-tress composed of wood fibers and resin is cured by applying heat and pressure in a press (see Figure 1. 1). Continuum and batch presses do exist, and one of the main issues in reducing the cost of the final product is to reduce the press cycle time. In order to improve the heat transfer between the <b>press</b> <b>platens</b> and the inner layers, some amount of water is added to the mat. Another issue is to adjust the parameters and the temperature history of the cycle in order to obtain a given density profile in the board. Normally, it is desirable to have lower densities at the center of the board i...|$|R
40|$|Steel fibre {{reinforced}} concrete (SFRC) {{is more often}} considered as a profitable re-placement of diffused reinforcement, like welded steel mesh, especially for thin cross section. In this case, fire becomes a crucial condition for design. An experi-mental investigation {{was carried out in}} order to evaluate the benefits in fire resis-tance of steel fibre when structural elements are bent (di Prisco et al. 2003). First of all, four point bending tests were carried out on notched 600 mm long beams with a 150 x 150 mm cross section and a notch/depth ratio equal to 0. 3. Once car-ried out the bending tests, two cylinder specimens were cored from each beam: one was tested in uniaxial compression while the other, once notched, was tested in direct tension. The average uniaxial tension and compression test results are first used as con-stitutive relationships to reproduce the bending tests, neglecting notch effects. A brief description of the experimental set-up used in direct tension is instru-mental to present and discuss the eccentric tension imposed in the specimens by an active control designed to keep the <b>press</b> <b>platens</b> fixed. The measured bending moment was adopted to quantify the heterogeneity degree of SFRC specimens, be-fore and after cracking...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The {{standard}} (ASTM) steady-state {{method for}} determining the thermal conductivity of insulating materials (like wood based composite materials) is time-consuming, and its use is therefore limited to dry material; moisture migration occurs in hydrated materials and this limits accuracy. The proposed unsteady-state method is fast and therefore enables thermal properties of hygroscopic materials to be measured. The specimens are <b>pressed</b> by hot <b>platens</b> and the temperature rise inside them is measured. By comparing experimental data with the theoretical solutions of the "heat equation", thermal properties are determined using error minimization computer programs.

40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} {{thermoplastic}} composites (TPC) {{increased significantly}} because of their low cost, fast processing cycles and recyclability. In an effort to provide a manufacturing technique well suited for large TPC parts, Delft University of Technology has developed an infusion process based on a reactive anionic polyamide- 6 (APA- 6) resin system. Following recent work where significant differences in mechanical and physical laminates property with respect to flow direction were identified, the work presented in this thesis aims at improving laminate uniformity by testing different heating set-ups and infusion strategies. First, the fibre coupling agent, contained in the proprietary 8225 finish, was tested to asses its compatibility with APA- 6. Results show that this fibre coupling agent {{is compatible with the}} APA- 6 matrix system, but is not better or worse that the previous 8207 finish used in previous work done at TU Delft. Through a second study, key laminate properties were evaluated (ILSS, crystallinity and degree of conversion) using two different heating set-ups (<b>platen</b> <b>press</b> and infrared panels) over three different curing temperatures (160 - 180 ℃). The results of this study identified that the infrared method yielded better laminates than the <b>platen</b> <b>press</b> set-up. However, most laminate produced still had non-uniform properties with respect to flow direction, but laminates cured at 180 ℃ showed better average properties. Based on these results, to improve property uniformity, a third study was conducted using the double infusion strategy: a low infusion temperatures (110 - 150 ℃) followed by a curing step performed at 180 ℃. The results showed that the best laminate uniformity could be achieved with this double infusion strategy at infusion temperatures between 110 ℃ and 130 ℃. The Tm and ILSS of these laminates exhibited lower standard deviation when compared to the one infused at 150 ℃ and the one polymerised with a non-isothermal strategy. This uniformity enhancement was also validated with comparative laminate C-scans and optical microscopy results...|$|R
