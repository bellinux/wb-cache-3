25|$|The lake is in {{the region}} of dry {{subtropical}} forest and hence the vegetation around the lake is sparse, with cacti and scrub-type shrubs.

50|$|The Muisca {{established}} their civilisation typically as of 800 AD. They were an advanced culture and performed agriculture {{on the high}} plains of the savanna. In the Muisca times maize, potatoes, arracacha, quinoa, sweet potatoes, yuca, peppers, tomatoes, beans and pumpkins were cultivated in Mosquera. The Muisca were predominantly farmers and traders and their economy {{was based on the}} extraction of salt from the northern parts of the Bogotá savanna. Fruits and other agricultural products growing in different climates were traded on the frequent markets of the Muisca. In Mosquera pineapples, avocadoes, guanabanas, ice-cream beans, <b>pitahayas</b> and guayabas were the fruits traded with warmer climates. Tobacco also came from more tropical regions while cotton was traded with the colder climate Lache.|$|R

25|$|The {{ecological}} system here {{is considered to}} be recently evolved with a number of endemic species. The lower elevations are dominated by desert and arid condition plants. This includes the world’s largest species of cactus, the cardón cactus, which can reach heights of 15m. Other plant species include mesquite, chironola, lechuguilla, nopal and barrel cactus, choyas, paloadan and <b>pitahaya.</b> The higher elevations have forests of pine and holm oak with some deciduous forests, with leaves falling in the dry season, generally no taller than fifteen meters. Wildlife in the desert areas is restricted to birds, reptiles and small to medium mammals such as rabbits and coyotes. Upper elevations with more vegetation can have wild rams, pumas, other wild cats, raccoons, deer, foxes and wild cats. Marine species include whales, seals, dolphins, gray whales, manta rays and sea turtles.|$|E
500|$|Almost any fleshy cactus {{fruit is}} edible. The word pitaya or <b>pitahaya</b> (usually {{considered}} to have been taken into Spanish from Haitian creole) {{can be applied to}} a range of [...] "scaly fruit", particularly those of columnar cacti. The fruit of the saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) has long been important to the indigenous peoples of northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States, including the Sonoran Desert. It can be preserved by boiling to produce syrup and by drying. The syrup can also be fermented to produce an alcoholic drink. Fruits of Stenocereus species have also been important food sources in similar parts of North America; Stenocereus queretaroensis is cultivated for its fruit. In more tropical southern areas, the climber Hylocereus undatus provides <b>pitahaya</b> orejona, now widely grown in Asia under the name dragon fruit. Other cacti providing edible fruit include species of [...] Echinocereus, Ferocactus, Mammillaria, Myrtillocactus, Pachycereus, Peniocereus and Selenicereus. The bodies of cacti other than opuntias are less often eaten, although Anderson reported that Neowerdermannia vorwerkii is prepared and eaten like potatoes in upland Bolivia.|$|E

2500|$|Most of the {{territory}} is used for pasture and forestry, with total about ninety percent. The rest is used for agriculture, most of which is done only during the rainy season. Just over 43% of the economically active are working agriculture, livestock, forestry and fishing. [...] Thirty of the municipality’s communities engage in agriculture to some degree {{with most of the}} production for self consumption. The soil is fertile although it is sometimes hard with some drainage problems. These problems are greatest where the topsoil is less than ten centimeters. One problem with agriculture here is that the soil erodes easily. [...] Fruit trees include mango, oranges, limes, bananas, guavas, avocados and papaya. Other crops such as sugar cane, corn, beans, green chili peppers, cascabel chili peppers, tomatoes, watermelon, squash, chickpeas, sorghum, barley [...] and <b>pitahaya.</b> Most livestock is raised in the communities of El Refugio, San Juan Buenaventura, La Florida, San José de la Flores, Río de Carrizal, Ayutla, Salitrillo and Tepame.

The initial symptoms of the disease, appearing {{two to three days}} after inoculation, are yellowish lesions that are water soaked, which progress to a brown color. Seven to ten days after initial appearance of lesions, the rot expands to form large areas of rot which grow dark colored spores. The rot then dries, and the plant dies.|$|E
