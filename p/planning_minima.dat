The machining process is considered by computing the workpiece-tool engagement along the toolpath and setting local feed limits to maintain a specified resultant cut-ting force. The drive constraints are considered by limiting the velocity, acceleration, and jerk magnitudes commanded to each actuator. Feed profiling is realized with uninterrupted accelera-tion transitions, capable of spanning multiple toolpath segments.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{consider}} {{the use of multiple}} mobile software agents to perform different tasks in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). To this regard, determining the number of mobile agents in the WSN remains an open issue in solving multi-agent itinerary planning (MIP) problem. We propose a novel scheme entitled MST-MIP based on minimum spanning tree, where each branch stemmed from the sink corresponds to a group of source nodes assigned for a mobile agent to visit. Furthermore, a balancing factor α is introduced to achieve a flexible trade-off control between energy cost and task duration, and the balanced MST-MIP algorithm is named BST-MIP. Extensive experiments show that MST-MIP has lower energy consumption than previousMIP proposals, while BST-MIP decreases the task duration up to 50 %.

This paper designs a mathematical model of drought resilience to assess farmers' survival strategies when {{faced with the prospect of}} repeated droughts. A key distinction is being made here between consecutive droughts and one-off droughts, as it is the former, which is of most concern to farmers as well as policy makers. The mathematical model is generalized to incorporate the possibility of more than one set of a certain number of consecutive droughts occurring in the future. Findings indicate varying implications for groundwater sustainability when resilience outcomes are directly linked to the length of a farmer's drought planning horizon as well as to the <b>planned</b> <b>minimum</b> consumption during drought years. 22 page(s...|$|R

40|$|<b>Planning</b> <b>minimum</b> time trajectories among {{obstacles}} {{would seem}} to require the availability of an accurate global representation of environment geometry. This poses several problems for path planning for autonomous mobile robots (AMR's) which are not provided with an a priori description of their environment. First, AMR's may need to travel along previously unseen routes. Second, even when the routes have been traversed previously, {{it can be difficult}} to acquire an accurate description of the geometry of the environment along the route. A path-planning approach is described whose initial trajectory along some route may be guaranteed safe on the basis of local information alone.

40|$|Abstract—A new {{approach}} based on interval analysis is devel-oped {{to find the}} global minimum-jerk (MJ) trajectory of a robot manipulator within a joint space scheme using cubic splines. MJ trajectories are desirable for their similarity to human joint move-ments and for their amenability to path tracking and to limit robot vibrations. This makes them attractive choices for robotic appli-cations, {{in spite of the}} fact that the manipulator dynamics is not taken into account. Cubic splines are used in a framework that as-sures overall continuity of velocities and accelerations in the robot movement. The resulting MJ trajectory planning is shown to be a global constrained minimax optimization problem. This is solved by a newly devised algorithm based on interval analysis and proof of convergence with certainty to an arbitrarily good global solu-tion is provided. The proposed planning method is applied to an example regarding a six-joint manipulator and comparisons with an alternative MJ planner are exposed.

Methods Forty-five simulation CT scans of 39 patients previously treated for thoraco-lumbar spinal bone metastases were used. Three different treatment plans were created: (1) single posterior field plans using the ICRU reference points (ICRUrps); (2) single posterior field plans using the International Bone Metastasis Consensus Working Party reference points (IBMCrps); (3) two opposed anterior-posterior (AP-PA) field plans using the ICRUrps. The intended dose range for planning target volume (PTV) was 90 % to 110 % of the prescribed dose for AP-PA field plans. Cumulative dose-volume histograms were generated for each <b>plan,</b> and <b>minimum,</b> maximum and mean doses to the PTV, medulla spinalis, esophagus and intestines were analyzed. Results The mean percentages of minimum, maximum and mean PTV doses ± standard deviation were, respectively, 91 ± 1. 3 %, 108. 8 ± 1. 3 % and 99. 7 ± 1. 3 % in AP-PA field plans; 77. 3 ± 2. 6 %, 122. 2 ± 4. 3 % and 99. 8 ± 2. 6 % in ICRUrp single field plans; and 83. 7 ± 3. 3 %, 133. 9 ± 7. 1 % and 108. 8 ± 3. 3 % in IBMCrp single field <b>plans.</b> <b>Minimum</b> doses of both single field plans were significantly lower (p Conclusion In palliative spinal bone irradiation, 2 D conventional single posterior field radiotherapy did not accomplish the ICRU Report 50 recommendations for PTV dose distribution, while the AP-PA field plans did achieve the intended dose ranges with a homogenous distribution and reasonable doses to the medulla spinalis, esophagus and intestines. </p...|$|R
