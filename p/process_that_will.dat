5|$|Ms. Hartman and Jackie {{are taken}} by the Cybermen for conversion, but the Cyber Leader orders the Doctor held aside because he has {{valuable}} information about the Daleks. The Cyber Leader is destroyed by a strike team led by Jake Simmonds, who have travelled from their universe {{in pursuit of the}} Cybermen. Ms. Hartman is converted, but Jackie escapes into a stairwell. Jake uses a device around his neck to take the Doctor to the parallel universe and their version of Torchwood. The Doctor meets with the alternate universe Pete Tyler, who tells him that after he left the Cybermen were sealed in their factories while humanity decided what to do with them. In the meantime, the Cybermen vanished and the breach began causing unprecedented global warming on the parallel Earth, which the Doctor theorises is the start of the <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> lead to both planets falling into the Void. Pete demands the Doctor seal the breach before his Earth is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} gas a super-Earth that formed in situ acquires {{may depend on}} when the {{planetary}} embryos merged due to giant impacts relative to the dissipation of the gas disk. If the mergers happen after the gas disk dissipates terrestrial planets can form, if in a transition disk a super-Earth with a gas envelope containing a few percent of its mass may form. If the mergers happen too early runaway gas accretion may occur leading {{to the formation of}} a gas giant. The mergers begin when the dynamical friction due to the gas disk becomes insufficient to prevent collisions, a <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> begin earlier in a higher metalicity disk. Alternatively gas accretion may be limited due to the envelopes not being in hydrostatic equilibrium, instead gas may flow through the envelope slowing its growth and delaying the onset of runaway gas accretion until the mass of the core reaches 15 Earth masses.|$|E

25|$|Following similar {{declarations}} by Auckland City and the Auckland Regional Council, {{political and}} design processes were underway {{in the mid}} and late 2000s to define the future shape of the area, a change <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> take up to 20 years. One of the main public inputs {{at that time was}} a wish for increased waterfront access, as well as the desire for more parkland on the point. However, some of these wishes were muted from political sources, as the redevelopment of the area is to be paid by the development of residential areas, with the available land for this use shrinking with an increase of the proposed park space. Already mostly agreed on was a bridge connecting the new quarter to the Viaduct Basin.|$|E
25|$|Qutb's written {{works are}} still widely {{available}} {{and have been}} translated into many Western languages. His best known work is Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq (Milestones), {{but the majority of}} Qutb's theory can be found in his Qur'anic commentary Fi zilal al-Qur'an (In the Shade of the Quran). This 30-volume work is noteworthy for its innovative method of interpretation, borrowing heavily from the literary analysis of Amin al-Khuli, while retaining some structural features of classical commentaries (for example, the practice of progressing from the first sura to the last). For Qutb, the Qur'an was seen as the final arbiter in all matters relating to faith, while his main goal in writing the book, In the Shade of the Qur’an, was to restore the centrality of faith in the consciousness and imagination of Muslims, and to kindle a cognitive revolution that would bring about a political and social <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> lead to the renewal of the Islamic tradition.|$|E

25|$|Since bone {{healing is}} a natural <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> occur most often, {{fracture}} treatment aims to ensure the best possible function of the injured part after healing. Bone fractures typically are treated by restoring the fractured pieces of bone to their natural positions (if necessary), and maintaining those positions while the bone heals. Often, aligning the bone, called reduction, in good position and verifying the improved alignment with an X-ray {{is all that is}} needed. This process is extremely painful without anesthesia, about as painful as breaking the bone itself. To this end, a fractured limb usually is immobilized with a plaster or fiberglass cast or splint that holds the bones in position and immobilizes the joints above and below the fracture. When the initial post-fracture edema or swelling goes down, the fracture may be placed in a removable brace or orthosis. If being treated with surgery, surgical nails, screws, plates, and wires are used to hold the fractured bone together more directly. Alternatively, fractured bones may be treated by the Ilizarov method which is a form of external fixator.|$|E

The circus had previously put together a nine-minute pregame show at the 2007 Super Bowl.

500|$|In critiquing {{the rise}} of Internet-based computing, the {{philosophical}} {{question of whether or}} not a society can control technological progress was raised. At the online scientific magazine Edge, Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger argued that individual will was all that was necessary to maintain the cognitive capacity to read a book all the way through, and computer scientist and writer Jaron Lanier rebuked the idea that technological progress is an [...] "autonomous <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> proceed in its chosen direction independently of us". Lanier echoed a view stated by American historian Lewis Mumford in his 1970 book The Pentagon of Power, in which Mumford suggested that the technological advances that shape a society could be controlled if the full might of a society's free will were employed. Lanier believed that technology was significantly hindered by the idea that [...] "there is only one axis of choice" [...] which is either pro- or anti- when it comes to technology adoption. Yet Carr had stated in The Big Switch that he believed an individual's personal choice toward a technology had little effect on technological progress. According to Carr, the view expressed by Mumford about technological progress was incorrect because it regarded technology solely as advances in science and engineering rather than as an influence on the costs of production and consumption. Economics were a more significant consideration in Carr's opinion because in a competitive marketplace the most efficient methods of providing an important resource will prevail. As technological advances shape society, an individual might be able to resist the effects but his lifestyle will [...] "always be lonely and in the end futile"; despite a few holdouts, technology will nevertheless shape economics which, in turn, will shape society.|$|E
