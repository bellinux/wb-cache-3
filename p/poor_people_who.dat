5|$|During the Panic of 1893, Lilly {{created a}} {{commission}} to help provide food and shelter to the <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were adversely affected. His work with the commission led {{him to make a}} personal donation of funds and property to the Flower Mission of Indianapolis in 1895. Lilly's substantial donation allowed it to establish Eleanor Hospital, a children's hospital in Indianapolis named in honor of his deceased daughter. The hospital cared for children from families who had no money to pay for routine medical care; it closed in 1909.|$|E
5|$|In December 1483, Richard instituted what {{later became}} known as the Court of Requests, a court to which <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> could not afford legal {{representation}} could apply for their grievances to be heard. He also improved bail in January 1484, to protect suspected felons from imprisonment before trial and to protect their property from seizure during that time. He founded the College of Arms in 1484, he banned restrictions on the printing and sale of books, and he ordered the translation of the written Laws and Statutes from the traditional French into English. He ended the arbitrary benevolences (a device by which Edward IV raised funds), made it punishable to conceal from a buyer of land that a part of the property had already been disposed of to somebody else, required that land sales be published, laid down property qualifications for jurors, restricted the abusive Courts of Piepowders, regulated cloth sales, instituted certain forms of trade protectionism, prohibited the sale of wine and oil in fraudulent measure, and prohibited fraudulent collection of clergy dues, among others. Churchill implies he improved the law of trusts.|$|E

25|$|The Food Stamp Plan—a {{major new}} welfare program for urban poor—was {{established}} in 1939 to provide stamps to <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> could {{use them to}} purchase food at retail outlets. The program ended during wartime prosperity in 1943, but was restored in 1961. It survived into the 21st century with little controversy because it was seen to benefit the urban poor, food producers, grocers and wholesalers, as well as farmers. Thus it gained support from both liberal and conservative Congressmen. In 2013, however, Tea Party activists in the House tried to end the program, {{now known as the}} Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, while the Senate fought to preserve it.|$|E
25|$|Conspicuous compassion, the {{practice}} of publicly donating great sums of money to charity to enhance the social prestige of the donor, is sometimes described {{as a type of}} conspicuous consumption. This behaviour has long been recognised and sometimes attacked—for example, the New Testament story Lesson of the widow's mite criticises wealthy <b>people</b> <b>who</b> make large donations ostentatiously while praising <b>poorer</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> make small but comparatively more difficult donations in private.|$|R
5000|$|The {{church was}} built in 1848 as a chapel of ease in the parish of St Mary the Virgin's Church, Tetbury. [...] At that time the richer people paid a fee {{for the use of}} a pew in St Mary's (a pew rent).

25|$|Another part of {{restructuring}} the movement comes from education; bell hooks {{points out that}} there is an anti-intellectual stigma among the masses. Poor people do not want to hear from intellectuals because they are different and have different ideas. As bell hooks points out though, this stigma against intellectuals leads to <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have risen up to become graduates of post secondary education, to be shunned because they are no longer {{like the rest of the}} masses. In order for us to achieve equality, people must be able to learn from those who have been able to smash these stereotypes. This separation leads to further inequality and in order for the feminist movement to succeed, they must be able to bridge the education gap and relate to those in the lower end of the economic sphere. If they are able to do this, then there will be more success and less inequality.|$|E

[...] The following week Wright proposed the idea to Martin Luther King Jr., who subsequently organized the Poor People's March on Washington. Around the same time CBS broadcast a major documentary, Hunger in America, which had been made on the suggestion of Kennedy to television executive Don Hewitt.|$|E

40|$|This article, {{which is}} both {{conceptual}} and a synthesis of the literature, considers the research component of poverty alleviation strategies for people whose livelihoods depend significantly on tree and forest resources. Two policy approaches are contrasted: enhancing the utilisation of indigenous tree species within the household and the local economy, and integrating tree and forest-dependent peoples into the wider economy by promoting the commercialisation of conventional tree crop production. It is argued that the discussion is relevant for other <b>poor</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>who</b> depend on perennial production systems, and that the conclusions contribute to the wider debate about remoteness, market access, decentralisation and targeting in policy formulation, and globalisation...|$|R
500|$|On August 1, about 7,000 people {{gathered}} at Braddock's Field. The crowd consisted primarily of <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> owned no land, and most did not own whiskey stills. The furor over the whiskey excise had unleashed anger about other economic grievances. By this time, {{the victims of}} violence were often wealthy property owners who had no connection to the whiskey tax. Some of the most radical protesters wanted to march on Pittsburgh, which they called [...] "Sodom", loot {{the homes of the}} wealthy, and then burn the town to the ground. Others wanted to attack Fort Fayette. There was praise for the French Revolution and calls for bringing the guillotine to America.

2500|$|Another {{issue with}} rising affluence in India and China was {{reducing}} the [...] "shock absorber" [...] of <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{are forced to}} reduce their resource consumption when food prices rise.

Abundance of perfumes and preparations were prescribed by physicians, some of one kind and some of another, in which the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> listened to them put themselves to a great, and indeed, in my opinion, to an unnecessary expense; and the <b>poorer</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> only set open their windows night and day, burned brimstone, pitch, and gunpowder, and such things in their rooms, did as well as the best; nay, the eager <b>people</b> <b>who,</b> as I said above, came home in haste and at all hazards, found little or no inconvenience in their houses, nor in the goods, and did little or nothing to them.|$|R
2500|$|Slavery {{was banned}} in the Province of Georgia soon after its {{founding}} in 1733. The colony's founder, James Edward Oglethorpe, fended off repeated attempts by South Carolina merchants and land speculators to introduce slavery to the colony. In 1739, he wrote to the Georgia Trustees urging them to hold firm: [...] "If we allow slaves we act against the very principles by which we associated together, which was to relieve the distresses. Whereas, now we should occasion the misery of thousands in Africa, by setting men upon using arts to buy and bring into perpetual slavery the <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> now live there free."

2500|$|Countess Waldegrave {{was a local}} benefactor {{who paid}} for many {{improvements}} to the religious and social life in Hastings and St Leonards-on-Sea in the 19th century. [...] Holy Trinity Church was built in central Hastings at her expense in 1857–58. [...] Its site had been a wasteland which was home to hundreds of itinerant workers and <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> lived in shacks; they were displaced when the church was built, and many had to move to St Leonards-on-Sea, exacerbating the problem {{of a lack of}} accommodation for worship. [...] Lady St John (Louisa Boughton), the widow of Sir John Vaughan and St Andrew St John, 14th Baron St John of Bletso [...] and a friend of Countess Waldegrave, was concerned by the situation, and paid for a new church for central St Leonards-on-Sea which would be free of pew rents. [...] Built on the site of a former quarry and paid for entirely by Lady St John, Christ Church opened on 9September 1860 and was served by clergy from St Mary Magdalene's Church.

40|$|Relative poverty (which categorises as ‘poor’ {{those who}} fall seriously below normal {{nationwide}} material standards) is undoubtedly a useful and important concept in social science. However, this article {{argues that the}} widespread view that the word ‘poverty’ means ‘relative poverty’, which in mainstream social policy academic writing often extends into implying that those (including many <b>poorer</b> <b>people)</b> <b>who</b> do not define poverty this way are necessarily misguided, {{has led to an}} incomplete portrayal of the lived experience of <b>poorer</b> British <b>people.</b> The article examines published empirical work, before presenting findings from British Social Attitudes surveys and interviews with 40 unemployed Jobseeker’s Allowance claimants and 30 employed people. Both the existing and new findings exposed aspects of public attitudes and experience which resonate with noted unanswered academic criticisms of defining poverty as relative poverty, and which have tended to be glossed over or treated dismissively by social policy authors...|$|R
2500|$|From the 4th to 16th Century AD, Christian philosophers, while {{maintaining}} the condemnation of abortion as wrong, had varying stances on whether abortion was murder. Under the first Christian Roman emperor Constantine, there was a relaxation of attitudes toward abortion and exposure of children. Bakke writes, [...] "Since {{an increasing number of}} Christian parents were poor and found it difficult to look after their children, the theologians were forced to take into account this situation and reflect anew on the question. This made it possible to take a more tolerant attitude toward <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> exposed their children." [...] Saint Augustine believed that an early abortion is not murder because, according to the Aristotelian concept of delayed ensoulment, the soul of a fetus at an early stage is not present, a belief that passed into canon law. Nonetheless, he harshly condemned the procedure: [...] "Sometimes, indeed, this lustful cruelty, or if you please, cruel lust, resorts to such extravagant methods as to use poisonous drugs to secure barrenness; or else, if unsuccessful in this, to destroy the conceived seed by some means previous to birth, preferring that its offspring should rather perish than receive vitality; or if it was advancing to life within the womb, should be slain before it was born."(De Nube et Concupiscentia 1.17 (15)) St. Thomas Aquinas, Pope Innocent III, and Pope Gregory XIV also believed that a fetus does not have a soul until [...] "quickening," [...] or when the fetus begins to kick and move, and therefore early abortion was not murder, though later abortion was. Aquinas held that abortion was still wrong, even when not murder, regardless of when the soul entered the body. Pope Stephen V and Pope Sixtus V opposed abortion at any stage of pregnancy.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of Western Pennsylvania was 17,000 in 1790. Among the {{farmers in the}} region, the whiskey excise was immediately controversial, with many people on the frontier arguing that it unfairly targeted westerners. Whiskey was a popular drink, and farmers often supplemented their incomes by operating small stills. Farmers living west of the Appalachian Mountains distilled their excess grain into whiskey, which was easier and more profitable to transport over the mountains than the more cumbersome grain. A whiskey tax would make western farmers less competitive with eastern grain producers. Additionally, cash was always in short supply on the frontier, so whiskey often served as a medium of exchange. For <b>poorer</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were paid in whiskey, the excise was essentially an income tax that wealthier easterners did not pay.|$|R
