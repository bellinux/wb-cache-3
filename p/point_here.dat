After Paradise Point Road, the highway follows a winding, southeasterly course along Tupper Lake, passing little more than dense forests while crossing over the Bog River near its mouth. NY421 follows the lake to its southern tip, where the route ends at an intersection with NY30 {{just west of the}} St. LawrenceFranklin county line.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} thought to stand on, or near, {{the site of the}} first church {{established}} by St Erchard, the patron saint of Kincardine O'Neil, who brought Christianity here in the 5th century. He was taught at nearby Banchory by St Ternan. The church is located near a river (as common in early Christian sites), in this case the River Dee. There was an important river crossing <b>point</b> <b>here,</b> on the main route between Strathmore and Mar. The current church remains are thought to date to the 14th century. It was recorded that the church was built as a gift by Duncan, Earl of Fife. Alexander Kyninmund, Bishop of Aberdeen, rebuilt the church some time in the mid 14th century. A hospital was attached to the east of the church (thought to be in 1330) but was demolished some time before the church itself went out of use, leaving just the foundation stones (There was also an earlier hospital site in Kincardine O'Neil - see other site, 'Kincardine O'Neil Hospital Site'.). The church became ruinous after a new church was built in 1862. The interior was later converted into burial plots. The graveyard surrounding the church has many gravestones, mostly from the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|The {{estimates}} {{assume that}} a business knows what is required and does not waste time. Satisfying regulatory requirements will obviously take longer if the business lacks information or is unable to follow up promptly. A related <b>point</b> <b>here</b> is that DB may not understand “work-arounds”, “facilitating fees”, and “learning time” that speed or delay approvals and causes variation costs.|$|E
25|$|The {{relevant}} <b>point</b> <b>here</b> was, that price-value divergences occurred {{both with}} regard to inputs to production and {{with regard to}} outputs; but Marx himself had ignored the input price-value divergences in his simple quantitative illustrations {{of the distribution of}} profit. Since outputs become inputs, and inputs become outputs, critics alleged that unless input values are transformed in the calculation as well, the absurd mathematical effect in the model is that capitalist producers selling a good obtain a sale price that differs from the price paid by capitalist producers buying the same good.|$|E
25|$|For example, if E is a vector bundle over X, {{then there}} is a bundle E* over X, called the dual bundle, whose fiber at x ∈ X is the dual vector space (Ex)*. Formally E* can be defined as the set of pairs (x, φ), where x ∈ X and φ ∈ (E'x)*. The dual bundle is locally trivial because the dual space of the inverse of a local trivialization of E is a local trivialization of E*: the key <b>point</b> <b>here</b> is that the {{operation}} of taking the dual vector space is functorial.|$|E

25|$|In 1961 the British {{historian}} Edward Hallett Carr {{published his}} What is History?, which became well known. Therein Carr conjectured {{that the very}} nature of writing history will cause historians as a whole to reveal themselves to their readers as 'prisoners' subject to the context of their own age and culture. As a consequence, one may add, every generation feels the need to rewrite history so that it better fits their own situation, their point of view. To illustrate his <b>point</b> <b>here,</b> Carr selected as exemplars a number of well-regarded historians, among them being Theodore Mommsen.|$|E
25|$|Generalizing from static {{electricity}} to electromagnetism, {{we have a}} second potential, the magnetic vector potential A, which can also undergo gauge transformations. These transformations may be local. That is, rather than adding a constant onto V, one can add a function that takes on different values {{at different points in}} space and time. If A is also changed in certain corresponding ways, then the same E and B fields result. The detailed mathematical relationship between the fields E and B and the potentials V and A is given in the article Gauge fixing, along with the precise statement {{of the nature of the}} gauge transformation. The relevant <b>point</b> <b>here</b> is that the fields remain the same under the gauge transformation, and therefore Maxwell's equations are still satisfied.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} the organization, Christman began protesting in Florida against Scientology {{with members of the}} Lisa McPherson Trust. She picketed with signs outside of the organization's Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwater, Florida. Scientology representatives in Clearwater complained to police in November 2000 about the picketing, and Christman and Minton were fined US$100. On February 21, 2001, Judge Thomas E. Penick {{dismissed}} other charges in the case, and criticized Scientology for its treatment of critics, commenting, [...] "I'm missing the <b>point</b> <b>here.</b> I hope someone will let us know when the great invasion is coming." [...] This experience was a defining period for Christman, as she was concerned that her former church would attempt to characterize her as a criminal.
