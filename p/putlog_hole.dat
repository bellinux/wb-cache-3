Latitude: 37. 42. 47. 16 Longitude: 28. 41. 06. 18 Elevation: 458 mDimensions: H (total) : 2. 5 m ** W (total) : 1. 2 m ** p. L: 7 m ** Th (conduit side walls) : 0. 40 – 0. 50 m ** Interior H (conduit) : 1. 80 m ** Interior W (conduit) : 0. 50 m (above channel); 0. 30 m (within channel) ** p. H (shaft) : 0. 3 m ** p. W (shaft) : 0. 9 m by 0. 5 m ** Th (west wall of shaft) : 0. 65 mDescription: Preservation: The conduit running along the west (right) bank of the Ören Deresi has been exposed where the stream has eroded the earth of the stream bank into which it was originally constructed. The conduit wall along the stream has collapsed, revealing the longitudinal section and cross section of the structure as well as the longitudinal section of a rectangular shaft rising from the vault of the conduit. ** Construction: The vault is made of a single layer of fieldstones with rubble packing on the exterior, all bonded with a beige lime mortar with small stone inclusions. On the interior surface of the conduit wall, a very hard mortar with a reddish orange color covers not the stones of the wall but their interstices. ** Description: The external dimensions of the conduit are 2. 5 m high by 1. 2 m wide. In cross section, the interior of the conduit is 0. 50 m wide with a 0. 30 m wide channel centered in the floor. The channel is 0. 90 m in height, {{and the rest of the}} conduit rises another 0. 90 m above the channel. The conduit side walls are 0. 40 – 0. 50 m thick. An opening in the roof of the vault leads to an inspection shaft that rises vertically from the conduit and is preserved to a height of 0. 3 m above the vault. Both the opening in the vault and the shaft itself have interior width dimensions of about 0. 9 m parallel to the conduit and 0. 5 m perpendicular to the conduit. The well-preserved west wall of the shaft, which is built into the stream bank, is 0. 65 m thick. The east walls of the shaft and conduit have collapsed. The shaft walls perpendicular to the conduit have damaged interior surfaces and a preserved thickness of 0. 4 m. A single <b>putlog</b> <b>hole,</b> 0. 15 m by 0. 17 m, is located 1. 05 m above the ledge in the interior west wall of the shaft. The conduit is filled with sediment to a height of 1. 2 m...|$|E
40|$|Local Name: Işıklar DeresiLatitude: 37. 44. 46. 02 Longitude: 28. 43. 25. 08 Elevation: 609 mAxis: 120 degreesDimensions: Preserved H: 6. 10 m. ** Preserved length: 6. 60 m. ** Pier width (base) : 1. 65 m. ** Projected arch span: 6. 60 m. ** Height of {{projected}} arch bottom from streambed: c. 10. 50 m. Description: One complete pier of the aqueduct {{bridge with}} partial remains of two springing arches {{stands on the}} south side of a small stream. Other remains of the bridge include two masses of mortared rubble, one approximately 18 m. from the standing pier on the opposite bank of the stream and another adjacent to the standing pier at a distance of (**) m. These structures may be the remains of additional pier footings. The standing pier is not preserved to the height of the channel, and no trace of the channel can be found in either bank along the stream. ** Collapse or settling of the pier has resulted in a large hole through the structure, revealing its mortared rubble core. The upstream (east) face of the structure is more heavily damaged, with greater loss of facing blocks than the downstream side. The standing pier is 6. 10 m. at its maximum preserved height, 6. 60 m. long, and rests on a base 1. 65 m. wide. ** The bridge pier is constructed in petit appareil with blocks of roughly worked fieldstone (schist) in courses facing a mortared rubble core. The facing blocks are 0. 10 -. 60 m. long, 0. 05 - 0. 20 high, and 0. 20 -. 40 deep, with extensive use of chinking stones as small as 0. 05 m. long and 0. 01 m. high. This great variety of stone sizes is apparent in the rubble core as well, with stones ranging from 0. 05 -. 50 in length. Courses of blocks of standard size are interchanged with courses of smaller, more irregular stones. The mortared rubble core of unworked stones in a great variety of sizes, from 0. 05 -, 50 m. long, is densely packed and laid in rough levels. The blocks of the facing and rubble core are bonded with a pale grey/tan lime-based mortar with stone inclusions, most less than 0. 01 m. long. Where the pier is closest to the stream, large blocks form a foundation resting on bedrock to obviate damage due to water-induced erosion. ** The voussoirs of the arch spanning the stream (north) are recessed from the pier face 0. 15 m. at a height of 3. 60 m. from the base. Three courses of voussoirs rest on this level before the arch is recessed 0. 15 m. a second time, approximately 0. 40 m. above the lower recess. The resulting double-stepped profile of the arch provides two ledges to support scaffolding. At the same height, the entire length of the broad sides (east and west) of the pier are recessed 0. 07 m. above a course of stones larger than the average size, so that above this point the structure narrows 0. 20 m. in width. This upper recess extends even to the voussoirs of the arch spanning the stream, with the result that the lowest three courses of the arch are wider than the rest. The arch {{on the south side}} of the pier has no recess to support scaffolding, but a <b>putlog</b> <b>hole</b> just above the springing of the arch fulfills the same purpose. It is noteworthy that both arches are equipped with support for scaffolding at a point that is three voussoirs above the spring point, and that two different methods are used. ** While a few of the facing voussoirs are schist, most are marble blocks that are more finely worked than the facing stones of the pier and have visible chisel marks on their worked faces. They range from 0. 30 -. 40 m. long, 0. 10 -. 15 m. wide at the extrados, and 0. 20 -. 40 deep. Courses of four to five blocks span the width of the arch. The arch has a projected span of 6. 60 m. The height of the projected arch bottom from the streambed is c. 10. 50 m. Nothing remains of the hypothetical pier on the opposite stream bank resulting from this arch span projection...|$|E
50|$|<b>Putlog</b> <b>holes</b> or putlock {{holes are}} small holes {{made in the}} walls of {{structures}} to receive the ends of poles (small round logs) or beams, called putlogs or putlocks, to support a scaffolding. <b>Putlog</b> <b>holes</b> may extend through a wall to provide staging {{on both sides of}} the wall.|$|R

50|$|A {{historically}} {{common type}} of scaffolding, <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> date from ancient Roman buildings. The term putlock and the newer term putlog date from the 17th century and are still used today. Putlogs may be supported on the outer ends by vertical poles (standards), cantilevered by one end being firmly embedded in the wall, or cantilevered by penetrating the wall to provide scaffolds on both sides. Putlogs may be sawn off flush with the wall if they cannot be removed, but exterior <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> are typically filled in as the scaffold is removed to prevent water from entering the walls. Interior <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> may be left open, particularly if not in a finished space.|$|R
50|$|All that survives of {{the castle}} are a few wall remains, {{numerous}} <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> and rock chambers.|$|R
25|$|From {{the line}} of the walls, there may have been another {{entrance}} on the west side, but this is uncertain. A bank of earth appears to have been erected some distance away {{to the north of the}} castle, either as a form of defence, or perhaps to obscure the castle from a former road that ran past it from that direction. The towers seem not to have had ground-floor entrances. <b>Putlog</b> <b>holes</b> suggest that they had upper floors. <b>Putlog</b> <b>holes</b> in the curtain walls suggest the presence of hoardings to protect defenders. This large, lime-washed, stone, moated castle would have been visually impressive.|$|R
50|$|The inconsequential {{size and}} the spacing of the holes meant {{that they did not}} affect the {{solidity}} of the walls, and in well-preserved castles, like Beaumaris, the ancient <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> can be seen to this day.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The putlog is the {{horizontal}} piece {{on which the}} platform rests, the upright pole is called a standard. In some masonry buildings the holes into which the putlogs are inserted remain unfilled and are called <b>putlog</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|R

5000|$|It is {{suspected}} that in peacetime, hoardings were stored as prefabricated elements. Construction of hoardings was often facilitated by <b>putlog</b> <b>holes,</b> sockets {{that were left}} in the masonry of castle walls for wooden joists called [...] "putlogs". However, some hoardings were supported on permanent stone corbels.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} hole in {{the roof}} for the entry of the pigeons was covered by a flat stone and is now covered with glass to keep the interior dry. The interior of the roof has <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> rather than nesting boxes but {{may also have been}} used by pigeons.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower is}} {{rectangular}} in plan and fronts the street. The building façade shows the typical rows of stone externally {{as well as}} some <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> which were used in medieval times as supports for scaffolding (used to complete particularly high construction) or as placement holes for the support beams of exterior balconies.|$|R
50|$|The {{elevated}} entrance {{with its}} Gothic archway, with jambs made of tuff, lies at about four metres {{above the ground}} on the northern side and leads to the first floor. <b>Putlog</b> <b>holes</b> on the exterior show where the staircase access was. The doors turned in a carefully hewn out stone ring and could be locked with a bar.|$|R
500|$|The barbican {{was built}} at the {{beginning}} of the 14th century and contained a guard-room on the first floor. The barbican contains numerous <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> from its construction, although these would have been masked by exterior plasterwork in the medieval period. A passageway led up from the barbican to the gatehouse, probably originally guarded by a drawbridge and containing the accommodation for the castle's constable.|$|R
50|$|The Collegiate Church of Notre Dame dominates {{views of}} Mantes, {{particularly}} when approaching {{from the north}} or east, where it sits on a bluff above {{a bend in the}} River Seine. From the exterior, its most distinctive features are the large round windows (oculi) at gallery level (see below), the cage-like flying buttresses and the general pock-marked appearance, caused by the unusually prominent <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> (left over from where the original builders attached their wooden scaffolding).|$|R
50|$|The cella is a tall, {{circular}} shaft rising all the {{way through}} the center of both the podium and the rotunda. The cella is about 6.6 m in diameter at the bottom but tapers as it rises to a 5.6 m diameter at the top. The top features an oculus allowing for light. Throughout the cella, there are over 143 cut outs, divided into 12 rows of 10-14, in the walls of the cella that were used as <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> in the creation of the monument.|$|R
500|$|Cow Tower is {{a three-story}} {{circular}} {{building with a}} protruding turret, the main building being [...] across and [...] tall, tapering towards the top. Its walls, [...] thick at the base, are made of a core of flint stone, faced {{on the inside and}} outside with brick, and various <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> can still be seen in the walls. The turret, which contained a spiral staircase, would originally have been higher than the parapets, forming a look-out position. The walls rest on a stone plinth and several layers of mortared flint.|$|R
5|$|The {{architecture}} of Conwy has close to links to {{that found in}} the kingdom of Savoy in the same period. These include window styles, the type of crenellation used on the towers and positioning of <b>putlog</b> <b>holes,</b> and are usually ascribed to the influence of the Savoy architect Master James. The links between Conwy and Savoy are not straightforward, however, as in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built after James had left the region. The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider role played by Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the Conwy project.|$|R
50|$|In 1189, Pembroke Castle was {{acquired}} by William Marshal. The Earl Marshal then set about turning the earth and wood fort into an impressive Norman stone castle. The inner ward, which was constructed first, contains the huge round keep with its domed roof. Its original first-floor entrance was through an external stairwell. Inside, a spiral stairwell connected its four stories. The keep's domed roof also has several <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> that supported a wooden fighting-platform. If the castle was attacked, the hoarding allowed defenders to go out beyond the keep's massive walls above {{the heads of the}} attackers.|$|R
500|$|The castle has a {{rectangular}} plan and {{is divided into}} an Inner and Outer Ward, separated by a cross-wall, with four large, [...] tall towers on each side; originally the castle would have been white-washed using a lime render. The outside of the towers still have the <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> from their original construction, where timbers were inserted to create a spiralling ramp for the builders. Although now somewhat decayed, the battlements originally sported triple finial designs and featured a sequence of square holes running along {{the outside of the}} walls. It is uncertain what these holes were used for – they may have been drainage holes, supports for defensive hoarding or for displaying ornamental shields.|$|R
50|$|The {{elevated}} entrance {{was usually}} reached {{on a wooden}} or stone staircase or from a footbridge from {{another part of the}} building. Immediately in front of the entrance there was usually a wooden platform; on particularly long stairways there could be intermediate landings. A steep stairway and narrow landing in front of the entrance made it difficult for attackers to use heavy demolition equipment such as battering rams. Below the entranceway the corbels or <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> have often survived. Even the fixtures of the original wooden stairways are frequently still visible. In several cases, elevated entranceways built in the Late Middle Ages or Early Modern times were accessed by staircase towers with spiral staircases.|$|R
40|$|Local Name: Ciğlek DeresiLocal Information: The bridge, conduit, and tunnel {{are located}} on a small gully {{branching}} off {{the east side of}} the Ciğlek Deresi, a dry dere that runs north–south and connects to the Kepiz Çayı to the south. The Ciğlek Deresi forms the western limit of the Yahşiler plateau. The remains are located 4 km southwest of the modern village of Yahşiler, 2 km southeast of the modern village of Yeşilköy, and 16 km southeast of Aphrodisias. Latitude: 37. 36. 32. 024 Longitude: 28. 51. 40. 591 Elevation: 851. 3 mDescription: Preservation: The bridge that crossed the small gully north of the conduit no longer stands (E 034), but a cross section of the foundation, floor, and lower portion of the side walls of the conduit itself is preserved in the south hillside of the gully (E 035). The entire conduit is preserved inside the subterranean tunnel for 22 m, at which point the vault has collapsed. A short segment of conduit is preserved after this collapse, but a second collapse seals it off completely. ** Construction: Nothing can be said about the construction of the bridge that no longer stands (though see the projected original dimensions below). The conduit is a vaulted masonry structure built of regular blocks of the local sandy conglomerate rock, bonded with pink-beige lime mortar with densely packed stone inclusions smaller than 0. 01 m. The blocks are 0. 10 – 0. 40 m long, 0. 16 – 0. 20 m high, and ** 0. 15 – 0. 20 deep. Mortared rubble packing supports the exterior of the side walls and vault. The conduit floor also rests on a foundation of mortared rubble of smaller stones that is 0. 30 – 0. 35 m thick. The foundation is topped by a bedding of white-gray lime mortar ** with densely packed stone inclusions smaller than 0. 01 m. The mortar bedding is 0. 25 m thick under the center of the conduit floor but tapers to a thickness of 0. 10 m about 0. 20 – 0. 35 m from both edges of the floor. On top of this bedding is a very thin layer, 0. 001 m thick, of pink waterproofing mortar. On top of the pink waterproofing mortar is a layer of sinter, 0. 05 m thick. ** Description: The bridge must have originally been 5. 5 m high, 3. 8 m wide, and 8. 0 m long. The interior of the conduit is 1. 50 m wide and has a reconstructed height of 2. 25 m. Where the side walls are visible, they are 1. 15 m wide (east) and 1. 18 m wide (west). The portion of the conduit that has collapsed is 6. 7 m long. The preserved conduit within the hillside, which includes a 125 ° bend, can be divided into three segments according to differences in masonry. The first segment (as one enters the conduit from the north) is 8 m long on the outer side wall (west) of the bend and 7 m long on the inner (east) side wall, which is executed more sharply than the gently curving outer side wall. In this segment the vault is built of rubble masonry bonded with beige-pink lime mortar with small, loosely packed stone inclusions. A seam separates the rubble-vault segment from the next segment, which is 8. 8 m long and has a vault built of the same regular blocks as the side walls. The third segment has a vault of regular blocks, a portion of which has been rebuilt in rubble masonry with white-blue lime mortar with large, densely packed stone inclusions, most between 0. 005 m and 0. 012 m. The stones of the rebuilt portion are placed lengthwise across the width of the conduit and have a level profile, making it not a true vault at all. The <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> of the conduit are located at different heights within the three segments. They {{are located on}}e course lower in the regular-vault segment than in the other two segments. The <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> of the rubble-vault segment are set at intervals ranging from 0. 35 m to 1. 40 m in no clear pattern and are matched only roughly in pairs across the conduit. The <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> are set at shorter intervals at the inner part of the conduit curve. In the regular-vault segment, the <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> are set at intervals ranging between 0. 40 m and 2. 90 m, and are not matched across the conduit due to the bend. In the "false"-vault segment, the <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> are matched in pairs across the conduit, but those on the northeast side wall are located about 0. 14 m below those on the opposite side wall...|$|R
5|$|The Edwardian {{sites have}} strong {{architectural}} links to castles and town walls {{built in the}} kingdom of Savoy in North Italy during the same period. The resemblance between the two sets of buildings was first noted by historian Arnold Taylor in the 1950s. Similarities include the semi-circular door arches, window styles, corbelled towers, the positioning of <b>putlog</b> <b>holes,</b> tall circular towers and crenellations with pinnacles found in Edward's works in North Wales; in Savoy these can be seen in constructions such as the defences of Saillon, La Bâtiaz and Chillon Castles. Many of these similarities have been considered {{to be the result of}} the influence of the Savoy architect Master James of St George, employed by Edward I, and who brought other Savoyard architects with him to North Wales.|$|R
50|$|Today, of {{the entire}} fort survived only Donjon Tower that the people called Vojinović Tower with part of wall {{in the form of}} a square. Donjon itself belongs to the most {{beautiful}} tower of its kind in this part of the Serbia because of its fine proportions and properly sort stones in its walls. On that walls (thick about 3 m), the remains of Machicolation, <b>Putlog</b> <b>holes</b> or Hoardings can be seen, and in addition to the closed ground, had the floor, over which there was an open top of the tower with battlement on. As all Donjon, Vojinović Tower also had no entrance in the basement, but only on the floor with the southern side and it is approached by wooden stairs that in a case of emergency could be easily removed.|$|R
50|$|The 28-feet-high arches at {{the east}} and west ends of the {{crossing}} appear to be original, and their west faces are outlined by strip work of projecting tiles. A tall round-headed, stone-faced doorway (now blocked and with not much left of its original stripwork outline, but with its typically Saxon alternating horizontal and vertical slabs) gave access to the nave from the south. Unusual double splayed round-headed windows pierce the nave's north and south walls, and Scott (who found them during his restoration) suggested there were another pair near the west end of the nave's side walls. He saw this pair of windows, and <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> in the walls for supporting timbers, as evidence for a west gallery, for which space needed to be left between that pair of windows and the west wall.|$|R
50|$|Located {{in the old}} {{center of}} Cesena near the station and the Corso Cavour, the {{building}} makes an imposing impression, being taller than the adjacent historic buildings and having quoins of Istrian marble decorated with the papal insignia of Pius VI, {{who was a member}} of Ghini family. The massive exterior facade has <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> indicating incompleteness. The courtyard facade is one of the most evocative in Cesena, with a splendid three-storey gallery, with white stone columns on the two lower levels, which affords a view of the front of the Malatestiana Library. The stairway leads to a hall decorated with four statues by Francesco Calligari (Minerva, Ceres, Glory and Mars), from which one enters the great hall of honor, characterized by a cycle of 13 frescos (originally 15) on mythological subjects, created by Giacomo Bolognini between 1719 and 1721.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{research}} on Venetian and Ottoman architecture in Crete, this paper introduces a first inventory of fortified mansions and tower-houses. They formed a network controlling coasts, plains, and cultivated lands. It is hard to retrace the origin of these houses without deploying stratigraphic and chemical analysis. However, a first morphological study has identified recurring elements: a small plan with several floors and an access on the first level; embrasures, bretèches and <b>putlog</b> <b>holes,</b> {{as well as a}} fireplace; and a decorative sobriety. In a surveyed tower-house we find that military devices refer to a first constructive phase, while residential elements refer to a second phase. These hybrid features are common to fortified houses in the Mediterranean and beyond, which were strong elements of military and spatial organization. This vernacular and colonial heritage has got a significant value in terms of architectural models and possible reuse...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to expand our {{knowledge}} of the building techniques practised in Rome in the first decades of the fifth century. Starting with an analysis of the largest construction project in the city at that time – the great Honorian heightening of the imperial wall of Rome – comparisons were made with other buildings of that era in order to reconstruct the building process. We were particularly interested in the materials used (mainly bricks and tufa blocks), their origins (whether new or spolia), how they were used, how scaffolding was constructed (worked out by observing <b>putlog</b> <b>holes)</b> and recognising the various tasks of labourers put to work on this construction project. This study is part of a body of research on Roman construction techniques, a matter of interest to architects and archaeologists, particularly those that focus on Rome’s Aurelian Wall...|$|R
500|$|Architectural {{research}} in the late 20th and early 21st centuries focused less on the military aspects of the fortifications, however, and more on their roles as luxurious palaces and symbols of royal power. Each of the castles {{was designed to be}} suitable to support the royal court, should it visit. In the late 13th century, this meant having several sets of private chambers, discreet service facilities and security arrangements, producing, in effect, a royal palace in miniature. Some of these survive largely intact; Conwy, for example, has what historian Jeremy Ashbee considers to be the [...] "best preserved suite of medieval private royal chambers in England and Wales", including a private garden {{for the use of the}} queen. When built, the castles would have been more colourful than today, in keeping with the fashions of the 13th century.

This line of <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> is situated about 1 m above the top of an interior coating of mortar within the cistern, which extends up about 2 m {{from the bottom of the}} cistern. The <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> are placed about every 0. 30 m. ** Description: The cistern is situated near a Byzantine settlement where a large, vaulted subterranean cistern and agricultural blocks have been documented (F 009). The cylindrical drum of the cistern has an exterior circumference of about 32 m at ground level and an overall diameter of 10 m. The cistern incorporates a drum approximately 2. 5 m high, on top of which sits a dome covered in white-gray cement. An instep or ledge between the drum and the dome is obscured by this layer of cement. The thickness of the drum varies from 1. 10 m at the ground level to 0. 75 m where the dome begins. The dome is approximately 3 m high, has an internal diameter of approximately 9 m, and is topped by a vertically placed stone. ** The doorway faces east and pierces the drum. The jambs and lintel are all reused marble blocks. The bottom of the lintel has been carved with a semicircular opening. A stone slab with an Arabic inscription is cemented into the wall above the lintel. The dome and the upper courses of the drum are coated in a damaged layer of gray cement, into which is carved the year 1964 above and to the right of the doorway. This exterior coat of cement and the interior mortar waterproofing seem to date to the same time, perhaps 1964. ** Within the left (south) interior wall of the doorway is placed a recessed, triangle-shaped niche. The niche is 0. 24 m wide, 0. 20 m high, and 0. 30 m deep. The flat surface of this niche is smooth, and the worn edge of the marble block that forms the bottom of the niche indicates a long period of use, perhaps to hold a water container. ** The current floor inside the cistern is 2 m below the ground level outside. A staircase leads down from the doorway of the cistern to the floor. From inside the cistern, three entryways are visible at the level of the top of the 2 m high mortar lining. They are about 0. 25 m by 0. 30 m and are topped by large stone slabs. Two of these entryways have been filled with stones...|$|R
40|$|Local Name: Aphrodisias, Southeast NecropolisLocal Informant: Erdal BeyLocal Information: E/ SE of Southeast GateLatitude: 37. 42. 16. 259 Longitude: 28. 44. 14. 773 Elevation: 530 mAxis: northDimensions: Antechamber Length: 4. 60 m ** Antechamber Width: 2. 50 mDescription: Underground {{chambers}} {{very well}} preserved, nothing visible above ground; entirely excavated by Aphrodisias Museum in April 2005; the description relies on both observation {{and the museum}} report. Birds are msiting in all the <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> in the antechamber. The tomb consists of three interconnected vaulted spaces. They are accessed by a steep staircase (nine stairs, W: 0. 45 m, rise: 0. 20 - 0. 25 m, tread: 0. 15 - 0. 18 m) that descends toward the north, and the uppermost stair is a threshold block for a door that opens toward the north. The stairway enters an antechamber (Room A), an e-w vaulted space (L: 4. 50 m, W: 1. 35 m), through a vaulted doorway at {{the eastern end of}} the southern wall; the two vaults intersect at a groin vault, and the final stair is 0. 80 m above the floor, which is paved in sandy gravel. At the crest of the tympanum on each end wall is the opening for an air vent (H: 0. 32 m, W: 0. 40). A robber's pit through the north wall of the antechamber shows that it is 0. 78 m thick. The main burial chamber is reached through an arched doorway (H: 1. 70, W: 0. 85, D: 0. 80) at the western end of the south wall of the antechamber. The extrados of the arch reaches the height of the springing point of the vault. ** The main burial chamber is a complex vaulted space. It is roofed by three vaults: two n-s oriented vaulted spaces (L: 4. 10 m, W western: 1. 90 m (Room B), W eastern (Room C) : 1. 80 m,) joined on the northern side by an e-w oriented barrel vault. The intersections between the wider n-s vaults and the narrower e-w vault are groin vaults. The wall between the two n-s vaulted spaces is 0. 60 m thick. Square piers (L: 0. 40 - 0. 60 m) project into the four outer corners of the main burial chamber, probably an aspect of the foundation for the monumental superstructure. The vaults abut on the corner piers, and in the northeast corner, the undersides of the stair blocks interrupt the corner pier and the intrados of the vault. An airshaft near the ceiling opens up through the south end of Rooms B and C. The walls are built of regularly coursed petit appareil masonry. The individual blocks are on the larger side (H: 0. 20 - 0. 26 m, w: 0. 36 - 0. 58 m, D: 0. 32 - 0. 53 m), and throughout the mortar beds are scored at a careful downward angle. The most carefully finished masonry is {{on the south side of}} the arch between the antechamber and the burial chamber; seventeen well cut voussoirs form the arch, and the mortar beds are finished with a pyramidal ridge that makes a shallow apex between the stones. Each of the vaults in the substructure is built in two stages. The lower half is constructed of petit appareil masonry, and the upper half appears to be a poured mass of mortared rubble (Th: 0. 30 m). At the groin vaults – between the stairs and A, and at the northern end of B and C – indentations into the mortar follow the line of the intersecting vaults, perhaps the impression left by lath strips that covered joints in the centering. A second impression is also seen in mortar, that of a loosely woven rough cloth, like a burlap mat, on the eastern wall of room A and in the area of the lowest stairs. Square <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> are seen at the base of each vault. Three evenly spaced pairs are in the north and south walls of A (H: 14 - 20 cm, W: 18 - 20 cm, D: 20 cm), and further <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> in each end wall at level of the bottom of the air vents. One pair each are in the southern parts of Rooms B and C, just north of the corner piers; in each space there is also a single hole in the outer wall that is level with a shelf at the bottom of the arch between the two; and three tightly spaced holes are in the wall north of the B and C, opposite the shelf below the arch. Round <b>putlog</b> <b>holes</b> are found at the apex of the crossing vault north of B and C (eastern diam. 0. 13 m, western diam. 0. 08 cm). Six built cists of varying widths (L: 1. 80 - 1. 90 m, W: 0. 55 to 1. 05 m, D: 0. 55 m) are located in B and C, three on each side. The plastered dividing walls (W: 0. 32 - 0. 40 m) are coursed, but they are more roughly built than the walls of the tomb itself. The n-s dividing wall in the northern crossing vault between B and C is the roughest, and the final cist wall built across the doorway between A and B was removed during excavation. A narrow shelf (0. 06 - 0. 14 m) projects from all the walls of B and C at the height of the dividing walls of the cists to provide additional support to the cover slabs. Undisturbed soil was found 2. 90 m below the crest of the vaults. The architecture and finds suggest to the excavators a "late Roman date, perhaps fourth century. Finds: From the museum records: bones; charcoal; brick fragments; iron nails; 4 complete small glass unguentaria, and 4 fragmentary ones; and 7 complete lamps (one with a palmette handle), and 10 fragmentary lamps...|$|R

Description: The extant remains of the hypothetical aqueduct bridge include a section of the channel preserved in the hillside, with corresponding channel sidewalls across a small gully that must have been spanned by the bridge. The rubble walls are bonded with white lime-based mortar with small stone inclusions and rest upon a foundation layer of smaller stones that is 0. 30 -. 35 thick. The channel floor is laid on a mortar bedding 0. 10 m. thick with few stones, topped by a 0. 05 -m. thick layer of sinter. Though the channel walls appear to have no cement lining, such a layer for waterproofing does line the walls of the subterranean channel nearby.
