5|$|Mail {{service was}} chaotic during the stampede. Apart {{from the number}} of prospectors, two major {{obstacles}} stood in its way. To begin with, any mail from America to Dawson City was sent to Juneau in South-east Alaska before being sent through Dawson and then down the Yukon to Circle City. From here it was then distributed by the US Post Office back up to Dawson. The huge distances involved resulted in delays of several months and frequently the loss of protective envelopes and their addresses. The second problem was in Dawson itself, which initially lacked a post office and therefore relied on two stores and a saloon to act as informal delivery points. The NWMP were tasked to run the mail system by October 1897, but they were ill-trained to do so. Up to 5,700 letters might arrive in a single shipment, all of which had to be collected in person from the post office. This resulted in huge queues, with claimants lining up outside the office for up to three days. Those who had no time and could afford it would pay others to stand in line for them, preferably a woman since they were allowed to get ahead in line out of politeness. Postage stamps, like paper in general, were scarce and rationed to two per customer. By 1899, trained <b>postal</b> <b>staff</b> took over mail delivery and relieved the NWMP of this task.|$|E

40|$|Background: Type 2 {{diabetes}} is an increasingly prevalent chronic illness {{and an important}} cause of avoidable mortality. Patients are managed by the integrated activities of clinical and non-clinical members of primary care teams. This study aimed to: investigate theoretically-based organisational, team, and individual factors determining the multiple behaviours needed to manage diabetes; and identify multilevel determinants of different diabetes management behaviours and potential interventions to improve them. This paper describes the instrument development, study recruitment, characteristics of the study participating practices and their constituent healthcare professionals and administrative staff and reports descriptive analyses of the data collected. Methods: The study was a predictive study over a 12 -month period. Practices (N = 99) were recruited from within the UK Medical Research Council General Practice Research Framework. We identified six behaviours chosen to cover a range of clinical activities (prescribing, non-prescribing), reflect decisions that were not necessarily straightforward (controlling blood pressure that was above target despite other drug treatment), and reflect recommended best practice as described by national guidelines. Practice attributes and {{a wide range of}} individually reported measures were assessed at baseline; measures of clinical outcome were collected over the ensuing 12 months, and a number of proxy measures of behaviour were collected at baseline and at 12 months.

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} equipment scheduling problem under disruptions in United States Postal Service mail processing and distribution centers. These facilities contain a large variety {{of equipment and}} employ a non-homogeneous workforce that work on shifts of various lengths and start times. The scheduling of equipment (the determination of the configuration and usage of equipment to match mail arrivals) and the scheduling of workforce (the determination of the optimal size and composition of the workforce, their days off / lunch assignments, and overtime usage) to meet processing service commitment with a constantly changing demand {{are some of the}} most challenging problems. Over the years, there have been many research studies that focused on solution of the <b>postal</b> equipment and <b>staff</b> scheduling problems. A comprehensive review of these studies is conducted. In the most general sense, each of the equipment and staff schedule problems can be decomposed temporally so and hierarchical analytic approaches have been adopted. Along the time axis, these studies can be classified into strategic, tactical and operational levels. This thesis focuses on the operational equipment scheduling problem or equipment scheduling under disruptions and addresses the adjustment of production plans and workforce schedules through the use of overtime and flexible employees in the face of disruptions such as demand fluctuation and absenteeism that happen on a daily basis and may significantly change demand and the size of workforce. This problem is modeled as a large-scale integer program, which contains equipment scheduling, shift scheduling and overtime management, and break assignment modules. Comprehensive experiments have been designed to investigate the effects of the use of overtime, the control of absenteeism, and the importance of integrating equipment and workforce scheduling simultaneously. The model integrates seamlessly with other research studies and provides the necessary tools to manage the resources in a facility on a routine basis. To improve computational time, an efficient LP based decomposition algorithm has been developed. The algorithm uses linear programming solutions as target solutions to construct a local search process to examine neighboring integer solutions. The heuristic was first proposed for the equipment scheduling under disruptions and then extended to the staff scheduling problem where multiple diverse initial solutions were generated to cover the solution landscape. These heuristics were computational efficient and were able to quickly obtains high-quality feasible solutions and delivers final solutions on par with the state of the art branch and bound algorithm in the solution of integer programs...|$|R

Clinical questionnaires were completed by 326 / 361 (90. 3 %) primary care doctors and 163 / 186 (87. 6 %) nurses. At a practice level, we achieved response rates of 100 % from clinicians in 40 practices and > 80 % from clinicians in 67 practices. All measures had satisfactory internal consistency (alpha coefficient range from 0. 61 to 0. 97; Pearson correlation coefficient (two item measures) 0. 32 to 0. 81); scores were generally consistent with good practice. Measures of behaviour showed relatively high rates of performance of the six behaviours, but with considerable variability within and across the behaviours and measures. Discussion We have assembled an unparalleled data set from clinicians reporting on their cognitions in relation to the performance of six clinical behaviours involved in the management of people with one chronic disease (diabetes mellitus), using a range of organisational and individual level measures as well as information on the structure of the practice teams and across a large number of UK primary care practices.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{begins by}} outlining the theoretical and policy {{context for the}} Single Assessment Process (SAP), tracing this {{to the development of}} New Labour's Third Way' approach. This necessitates modernisation of the welfare state, with social services seen as a key area, particularly in terms of promoting independence and active participation by service users. SAP is intended to contribute to 'person centred care' - treating clients as individuals and providing them with real choices about their care - by integrating health and social services assessments into one overarching framework, with the client at the centre. Plymouth Social Services implemented SAP on 4 '^ April 2005. The discussion then turns to the design of the methodology for evaluating Plymouth's SAP implementation. Discussions with project sponsors resulted in a five strand methodology, incorporating a quantitative postal survey of service users, a quantitative <b>postal</b> survey of <b>staff</b> involved in operating SAP, staff focus groups, a file audit, and examination of management information drawn from the Plymouth Social Services client database. The evaluation revealed many interesting findings about the implementation, and about the operation of SAP within the Department, which are covered in detail in the results chapter. The core issue was failings in the implementation project itself, which impacted upon the robustness of the SAP process, and upon the quality of training, support and guidance documentation for staff, leaving them confused about the process. The increased length of time taken to record assessments on forms and IT systems caused backlogs and increased assessment waiting times. This, in conjunction with the confusion around processes and inadequate training and guidance, was blamed for poor recording quality. Staff were confident in their abilities to work in a person centred and multidisciplinary way, but analysis of the qualitative data revealed underlying problems in embedding these key concepts in assessment practice. Service users were relatively satisfied with the assessments they received; meanwhile, the many perceived problems with the operation of SAP was found to be causing high stress levels and low morale among staff. The final conclusions chapter evaluates the evaluation itself, outlining {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the methodology, identifying lessons learned, and providing suggestions for future research. Overall conclusions are then drawn about Plymouth's SAP implementation, finding that the vast majority of the intended project outcomes were only partially achieved, or not achieved at all. Given that SAP aimed to improve person centred care through strengthened multidisciplinary working, the failure of the implementation in these two areas was especially worrying. The evaluation, however, revealed a strong commitment from staff and service users to participate in consultation; workers in particular showed great insight, and a desire to become more actively involved in project management and implementation, providing a solid base to draw on for the future development of personal social services in the city. Ideas for such future developments form the final part of the dissertation, with a list of recommendations for the improvement of SAP, and for the management of future projects within the Department.
