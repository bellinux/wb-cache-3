5|$|With a Goodyear blimp overhead, Michigan got {{the ball}} to start the game, and on their first play from scrimmage, they lost three yards when DaQuan Jones made a tackle for a loss {{stopping}} Fitzgerald Toussaint; the loss decimated the drive, which ended in a three-and-out. Penn State's drive was no more successful – after one first down, Christian Hackenberg threw an interception. On Michigan's ensuing drive, however, they were set up on another third down and long, and Penn State's Jordan Lucas picked off Michigan quarterback Devin Gardner's pass, setting <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> up in the red zone. <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> capitalized, as Hackenberg threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to senior receiver Brandon Felder. Michigan struck right back, getting two first downs in the running game prior to Gardner throwing a 59-yard touchdown pass to Devin Funchess to tie the game. <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> {{did not get a}} first down on their next drive and tried to convert fourth down deep in their own territory, but failed, setting Michigan up with excellent field position. Penn State's defense, however, responded, with Glenn Carson sacking Gardner to put Michigan out of field goal range, forcing a punt that Michigan downed around the five yard line. On Michigan's next drive, their kicker Brendan Gibbons made a 47-yard field goal. After <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> again punted, Michigan embarked on a drive that included a third-and-long conversion, but ultimately ended when Gardner threw an interception to <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> defensive end Anthony Zettel, who started over Deion Barnes. It took <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> only one play to capitalize; Hackenberg threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Jesse James to put <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> back up 14–10. <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> struck again later in the quarter, again via a touchdown pass from Hackenberg to Felder. Late in the first half, <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> defensive end C. J.

5|$|In week 9, {{and after}} a bye week, Michigan {{traveled}} to State College, Pennsylvania {{to take on the}} <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> Nittany Lions. This game was seen as an important game in Michigan's season, as it was a nationally broadcast primetime game and allowed Michigan a chance for redemption after two consecutive losses. Michigan entered the game needing just one win to become bowl eligible, while Penn State's head coach Joe Paterno entered the game in search of his 399th career win. During the week leading up to the game, <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> was unsure of starting quarterback Robert Bolden's status for the game due to a head injury suffered during the previous week's game against Minnesota. It was later announced that former walk-on Matt McGloin would start the game for <b>Penn</b> <b>State.</b> Michigan lost to <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> the previous year by a score of 35–10, which was Penn State's first win at Michigan Stadium since 1996.|$|E
5|$|<b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> {{received}} the opening kickoff, and after achieving a first down, Christian Hackenberg threw a 68-yard pass to fellow freshman Adam Breneman for a touchdown, the first offensive touchdown Wisconsin had {{allowed in the}} previous eight quarters. Wisconsin failed to respond, going three-and-out, and punting on their subsequent drive. <b>Penn</b> <b>State,</b> though they began with poor field position, converted a few third downs, gained 52 yards on a bubble screen to Allen Robinson, and ultimately {{was faced with a}} fourth down and inches in the red zone, but committed a false start penalty bringing on the field goal unit. The field goal was blocked, continuing Penn State's special teams woes, however their defense remained stout, forcing another punt, however on the Lions' ensuing drive, Hackenberg threw his first incomplete pass of the day, forcing a punt. In the waning minutes of the first quarter, the Badgers embarked on a drive in which they scored several first downs from both the running game and passing game. At the end of the quarter, they trailed 7–0, but were threatening, and a few minutes later, tied the game via a 4-yard pass from Joel Stave to tight end Brian Wozniak. Later in the quarter, Wisconsin converted a third down and 16 situation, and ultimately scored a touchdown on a pass from Stave to Jeff Duckworth. On their next drive, <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> was set up in the red zone after a pass interference call in the end zone that broadcaster Ed Cunningham criticized, and a few plays later scored a touchdown via a 3-yard pass to Geno Lewis. Lewis was uncovered on the goal line play, and though Wisconsin coach Gary Andersen ran down the sideline signalling for a timeout, it was not granted, and the play stood. At the half, the score was tied at 14. After Wisconsin's opening drive stalled, the Nittany Lions embarked on a demoralizing drive that fostered widespread defensive confusion from Wisconsin and ultimately ended when Jesse James caught a 7-yard touchdown pass from Hackenberg to put <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> on top 21–14. On the ensuing Wisconsin drive, <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> freshman linebacker sacked Stave and forced a fumble that defensive end C. J. Olaniyan returned deep into Wisconsin territory. <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> earned points, with Ficken redeeming himself on a 28-yard field goal to put <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> up by 10 points. On the next two drives, each team went three-and-out. At {{the end of the third}} quarter, Wisconsin was near midfield during a drive in which they looked to pull within a field goal; at the end of the quarter, <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> led 24–14. On one of the first plays of the fourth quarter, Trevor Williams intercepted Stave's pass, ending a scoring threat, and furthering the Nittany Lions' momentum. <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> started their drive at their own 28-yard line, and had a third down and short, but a false start backed them up to a third and long; Hackenberg was unfazed, however, as he threw a 59-yard touchdown pass to Geno Lewis, putting <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> up by three possessions, 31–14. Down three scores, Wisconsin desperately needed a touchdown, and tried to convert a fourth down and 23, but <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> recorded a sack, and subsequently got the ball with 9:49 to play. They failed to execute, and about a minute later, punted the ball away. Wisconsin drove down the field and pulled within 10, 31–21, on a Wozniak reception, his second touchdown catch of the day. <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> got the ball off an onside kick with good field position, and faced a third down and three, but Donovan Smith committed his fourth false start of the day, and <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> had to throw the ball, and the pass was incomplete. Penn State's subsequent punt was blocked. On the ensuing drive, Jack Russell kicked a career long 48-yard field goal to pull Wisconsin within seven points. <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> started their drive after Wisconsin kicked it deep inside their own 20-yard line. <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> got some decent yardage on first down, but committed another false start, backing them up. Zwinak came through for the Lions, however, rushing on third-and-nine for 61 yards, his longest run of the season. From there, Penn State's drive stalled, and with 35 seconds left, Ficken attempted a 31-yard field goal, but missed, and Wisconsin consequently needed to drive the length of the field to score a touchdown, and they did get into <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> territory, but ultimately, with nine seconds left, Stave threw the ball into the end zone, and <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> safety Ryan Keiser came away with the interception for a touchback. Christian Hackenberg took a knee to end the game, and the Nittany Lions concluded their upset, winning 31–24.|$|E

5|$|<b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> {{received}} the opening kickoff, {{and on their}} first play from scrimmage, featured six offensive linemen (albeit unsuccessfully, as Bill Belton rushed for a one-yard loss), before driving down the field on a 13-play, 75-yard drive that culminated with Belton rushing for a five-yard touchdown; he carried the load on the drive, rushing the ball eight times for 36 yards. <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> would never relinquish that lead. Purdue subsequently went three-and-out, and <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> responded with another long drive (10 plays, 66 yards) that again culminated with a rushing touchdown, this time from Zach Zwinak on a one-yard run, his tenth touchdown of the season, becoming the 16th <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> player to eclipse 10, and the first since 2008, when both Evan Royster and Daryll Clark did. Purdue's ensuing drive ended {{in the second quarter}} when quarterback Danny Etling threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Justin Sinz, making the score 14–7 <b>Penn</b> <b>State.</b> Bill Belton lost a fumble on Penn State's next drive, but Purdue turned the ball over right back to <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> when Jordan Lucas intercepted an Etling pass. Zwinak rushed for his second one-yard touchdown of the game on the ensuing possession. The Nittany Lions scored once more in the first half, via an eight-yard pass from Christian Hackenberg to Adam Breneman, but on the ensuing kickoff, Purdue's Raheem Mostert scored a touchdown on a 100-yard return, thus ending the first half with a score of 28–14, <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> holding the advantage. Purdue came out of halftime with a vengeance, driving down the field for 84-yards, ultimately pulling within 7 points on an 11-yard rush by Etling. The first field goal of the game occurred on Penn State's subsequent drive, a 29-yarder from Sam Ficken putting the Nittany Lions ahead 31–21. The Boilermakers turned the ball over again on their next drive, and <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> capitalized when Zwinak rushed for his third touchdown of the game. Purdue turned the ball over on downs their final drive of the third quarter, though Hackenberg threw an interception giving Purdue an opportunity early in the fourth quarter; again, a fumble eliminated any chance of a scoring drive coming to fruition, and <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> went up 45–21 when Hackenberg rushed for a 4-yard touchdown to culminate an 11-play, 74-yard drive that encapsulated over a third of the fourth quarter, and ended with 4:27 to play. That would be the final scoring drive of the game, which <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> won by the aforementioned score, 45–21.|$|E
5|$|<b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> {{received}} the opening kickoff, however {{on their first}} play from scrimmage, Bill Belton lost a fumble and Minnesota recovered and kicked a field goal after failing to achieve a first down. Penn State's punt on the subsequent drive was downed at the four-yard line, but the poor field position did not adversely affect Minnesota, who drove down the field for a 15-play, 96-yard drive, highlighted by a 24-yard pass from Philip Nelson to Maxx Williams to convert a fourth down {{to get down to}} the <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> four-yard line, from which point they scored two plays later via a 1-yard run by David Cobb. <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> responded, however, with Zach Zwinak rushing the ball 5 times for 61 yards including a 38-yard run, and ultimately a 6-yard touchdown scamper. At the end of the first quarter, Minnesota led 10–7. In the second quarter, Minnesota wasted no time, embarking on a 13-play, 70-yard drive that lasted 6:54 and ended with Nelson rushing for a 6-yard touchdown. <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> responded, driving down the field on 13 plays for 65 yards lasting 5:57, culminating with Ficken kicking a 27-yard field goal after the drive stalled in the red zone. Late in the half, Minnesota drove down the field, and Nelson completed a 24-yard touchdown pass to Williams, putting Minnesota on top 24–10 at the half. Receiving the second half kickoff, Minnesota initiated a drive that included a 39-yard run by Cobb, but ultimately ended in their first punt of the day, which they downed inside the one-yard line. <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> achieved two first downs, but an illegal block in the back on Jesse James decimated the drive, which ended with a punt, but they caught a break a play later when Minnesota fumbled and Malcolm Willis recovered in Minnesota territory. The break did not materialize with any points, but their subsequent punt was downed inside the five yard line. Dreadful field position continued when, after driving for several yards, Minnesota's punt settled inside the five yard line, again setting <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> up with a long field. In the waning moments of the third quarter, <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> relied on Zwinak, who rushed several consecutive times to garner <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> breathing room. There was no scoring in the third quarter. <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> failed to convert a third down (they had still not converted any in the game), but Minnesota committed a roughing the kicker penalty, giving <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> a second chance with which they converted their first third down of the game, but ultimately turned the ball over on downs. After a Minnesota punt, <b>Penn</b> <b>State,</b> for the first drive of the game, relied on their passing game to drive down the field, but, when faced with a fourth down and ten deep in Minnesota territory, failed to convert. On Minnesota's ensuing possession, however, they managed to run only 47 seconds off the clock, and went three-and-out. Hoping not to again blow an opportunity, <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> moved promptly down the field, and got into the red zone. While there, a pass to Allen Robinson resulted in a pass interference penalty called against Minnesota, giving <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> the ball at the two-yard line, from where they fumbled, and Minnesota recovered, and embarked on a possession from which they would not relinquish the ball, winning the game 24–10, after no scoring in the second half.|$|E
5|$|UCF got {{the ball}} to start the game at their nine-yard line after a penalty on the kickoff return, and their junior quarterback Blake Bortles orchestrated an {{efficient}} drive in which he converted two third downs and was 6/7 passing for 65 yards and a 4-yard touchdown pass to Storm Johnson. <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> took over and got two first downs, the latter of which as a fourth down conversion, before a 44-yard pass to Allen Robinson immediately followed by a 6-yard touchdown run by Zach Zwinak to tie the game. <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> moved the ball on their next drive, but ultimately turned the ball over on downs giving UCF good field position, with which they ran a two play drive culminating with a 58-yard touchdown run by Johnson to make it 14–7 UCF. Penn State's special teams responded with a 44-yard kickoff return by Geno Lewis, but their offense went three-and-out, and though they punted the ball deep into UCF territory, the Knights marched down the field with a strong running game and scored another touchdown to go up 21–7. On Penn State's ensuing drive, Sam Ficken kicked a career-long 47-yard field goal. UCF got some decent yardage on their next drive, but Bortles threw his first interception since October 27, 2012 with 1:17 in the half, but they ran down the clock and Ficken missed his first field goal attempt of the season, a 57-yard try as time expired. At the half, UCF had 290 total yards including 170 rushing yards, compared to 220 total yards for <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> with only 89 rushing yards. <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> {{got the ball}} to start the second half, but punted on their first drive. UCF responded with a touchdown via a 25-yard pass. <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> came right back with a touchdown of their own. UCF's ensuing drive {{brought them to the}} one yard line, but <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> held them to a field goal, making the score 31–17. Zwinak rushed for his third touchdown of the game on Penn State's next drive, and Shawn Moffitt kicked his second field goal of the game. <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> drove 51 yards on their next drive before Zwinak lost a fumble with 5:43 remaining in the game. UCF went three-and-out, and on their punt, the snap went over the punter's head, and <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> got the ball at the UCF 25. <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> took advantage, scoring on a 5-yard touchdown pass to Allen Robinson with 57 seconds left. <b>Penn</b> <b>State</b> needed to regain possession of the ball after the score, and failed to do so, so ultimately UCF held on to win by three.|$|E
