40|$|Drawing from dual-process theories, {{this paper}} {{examines}} how generic design factors influence consumer <b>price</b> <b>expectation</b> with judgments of attractiveness and quality as mediators. In addition, it determines how centrality of visual product aesthetics (CVPA), an individual difference variable that captures a consumer's interest {{and involvement in}} aesthetics, affects these processes. Results indicate that the influence of natural designs on consumer <b>price</b> <b>expectation</b> is mediated through judgments of quality and attractiveness, harmonious designs exert a direct effect on <b>price</b> <b>expectation</b> and an indirect effect through quality judgments, and elaborate designs exert both direct and indirect effects via quality and via attractiveness. Compared to low-CVPA consumers, high-CVPA individuals base both quality and attractiveness judgments {{to a greater extent}} on design, and base their <b>price</b> <b>expectation</b> more strongly on the package's attractiveness. However, high-CVPA individuals do not infer higher quality from attractive packages than do individuals low in CVPA. Implications focus on assisting managers in pricing decisions and on advancing research on design effects. Ulrich R. Orth, Daniela Campana, Keven Malkewit...|$|R

Lyapunov exponents and Kolmogorov entropy determined that the oil price and the stock return series exhibited chaotic behavior. TAR-TR-GARCH and TAR-TR-TGARCH copula methods were applied to study the co-movement among the selected variables. The results showed significant evidence of nonlinear tail dependence between the volatility of the oil <b>prices,</b> the <b>expectations</b> of investors and the stock returns. Further, upper and lower tail dependence and co-movement between the analyzed series could not be rejected. Moreover, the TAR-TR-GARCH and TAR-TR-TGARCH copula methods revealed that the volatility of oil price had crucial effects on the stock returns and on the expectations of investors in the long run.|$|R

50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} with penetration pricing {{is that it}} establishes long-term <b>price</b> <b>expectations</b> for the product, {{and image}} preconceptions for the brand and company. That {{makes it difficult to}} eventually raise prices. Some commentators claim that penetration pricing attracts only the switchers (bargain hunters) and that they will switch away as soon as the price rises. There is much controversy over whether it is better to raise prices gradually {{over a period of years}} (so that consumers do not notice), or employ a single large price increase. A common solution to this problem is to set the initial price at the long-term market price, but include an initial discount coupon (see sales promotion). That way, the perceived price points remain high even though the actual selling price is low.|$|E

The survey showed that home buyers were knowledgeable about current conditions, they saw little or no risk in the housing market, they had very positive <b>price</b> <b>expectations,</b> they thought of housing as an investment, and they indicated they would hold out in a down market.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2013. Major: Economics. Advisor: Amil Petrin. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 70 pages, appendices A-C. This dissertation {{consists of two}} related chapters. In Chapter 1, I {{examine the effects of}} measurement errors in <b>price</b> <b>expectation</b> and shopping plans on the estimates of a consumer demand model. To this end, I estimate a household level store choice model in the supermarket industry. Errors in forecasting expected costs of planned shopping lists are prevalent in estimating a demand system for multi-product retail stores because price beliefs and shopping plans of individual households are not observed by researchers. Previous studies parsimoniously use realized shopping bundles as a proxy for the unobserved shopping list and assume homogeneous <b>price</b> <b>expectation</b> for all households and over the entire sample periods. This measurement errors introduce attenuation biases in the estimates of price elasticities toward zero. I improve on this approach in earlier studies by modeling endogenous shopping bundles by estimating good-household-time specific good purchase probability and quantity of purchased goods. I also construct household-time-store-good specific <b>price</b> <b>expectation</b> based on households' previous trips to the store. I show that heterogeneity in <b>price</b> <b>expectation</b> substantially reduces attenuation biases in the estimates of own price elasticities. In Chapter 2, I estimate the effects of pricing on storewide profitability in the supermarket industry. I use the estimated store choice model in Chapter 1 to measure the effects of price promotions on store choice decisions. Household-, time-, store-, and good-specific <b>price</b> <b>expectation</b> introduced in this model allows me to understand how price changes affect price beliefs of households over time and this facilitates measuring the dynamic effects of price promotions on store sales or profits. A straightforward extension of this analysis is to measure the effects of loss-leader pricing with price advertising of stores. I show that storewide effects of price discounts are larger and last longer when price promotions are offered for a long period and deteriorate over time. Also, price promotions more effectively attract customers to the store when they are applied {{to a wide variety of}} products even with a moderate level of price reduction than deeper price cuts over a small group of products. Lastly, feature advertising has substantial effects of boosting store traffics and this result supports the loss-leader stories where deep price cuts in a selected set of products lure customers to the store and improve storewide profits...|$|R

Upon delivery to an elevator, farmers received an initial payment for their grain from the CWB that represented {{a percentage of the}} expected return for that grade from the pool account. After the end of the crop year, July 31, an interim payment and a final payment were paid to farmers, in addition to their initial payment so they would have received 100 percent of the return from the sale of the grain they delivered, minus all overhead costs of the CWB. The initial payments were guaranteed by the Government of Canada so that farmers received payment even if there was a deficit in the pool account.

50|$|This {{behavior}} by agents {{is contrary to}} that which is assumed by much of economics. Economics has firm foundations in assumption of rationality, so the systematic errors made by agents in macroeconomic theory were considered unsatisfactory by Sargent and Wallace. More importantly, this behavior seemed inconsistent with the stagflation of the 1970s, when high inflation coincided with high unemployment, and attempts by policymakers to actively manage the economy in a Keynesian manner were largely counterproductive. When applying rational expectations within a macroeconomic framework, Sargent and Wallace produced the policy-ineffectiveness proposition, according to which the government could not successfully intervene in the economy if attempting to manipulate output. If the government employed monetary expansion {{in order to increase}} output, agents would foresee the effects, and wage and <b>price</b> <b>expectations</b> would be revised upwards accordingly. Real wages remain constant and therefore so does output, no money illusion occurs. Only stochastic shocks to the economy can cause deviations in employment from its natural level.|$|E

Otherwise, municipal officials stated that the museum's name Centre Le Corbusier - Heidi Weber Museum was damned by Mrs Weber. In mid-May 2016 Heidi Weber vacated the museum and removed images, sketches, sculptures, tapestry, furniture, the original models of the building, and an archive of Corbusier's letters and notes, after negotiations with the city of Zürich failed from her perspective.
