However, high soil concentrations of greater than 1.0ppm lead to marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth <b>performance.</b> <b>Levels</b> as low as 0.8ppm produce these same symptoms in plants that are particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly all plants, even those somewhat tolerant of soil boron, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when soil boron content is greater than 1.8ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0ppm, few plants will perform well and some may not survive.|$|E

30|$|There are {{two reasons}} why the {{criterion}} is optimised <b>performance</b> <b>level.</b> First, in some cases, the conventional <b>performance</b> <b>level</b> {{is not good enough}} for frugal innovation. An example of this is car horns in Indian cars. Since car horns are used excessively in India, they must be able to withstand much greater strain than in developed markets and even more than in other emerging markets (Herstatt et al. 2008). Thus, a higher <b>performance</b> <b>level</b> than that for horns in most premium cars in Europe is needed. This demonstrates that the <b>performance</b> <b>level</b> in frugal innovation is not always lower, to avoid over-engineering; in some cases, the requirement can be higher, as this example shows. The <b>performance</b> <b>level</b> must optimally fit the intended purpose and the specific requirements of the environment in which the frugal innovation will be used, especially for emerging and developing markets, with their special needs, but even for developed markets. The second reason is that the required level must be met very precisely. If the <b>performance</b> <b>level</b> is too high, as it is with the premium Western construction equipment, costs are too high. As noted, to significantly reduce costs is a primary aspect of frugal innovation. If the <b>performance</b> <b>level</b> is too low, specific requirements are not met and frugal innovation’s aspiration to deliver “high value”, “maintain quality”, and “maximising value to the customer” (see Table  2 and Table 3 in the Appendix) is not met. Thus, an optimal <b>performance</b> <b>level</b> is crucial.|$|R

25|$|When {{accounting}} for the costs (both real costs, such as time taken to select and recruit a replacement, and also opportunity costs, such as lost productivity), the cost of employee turnover to for-profit organizations has been estimated to be between 30% (the figure used by the American Management Association) to upwards of 150% of the employees' remuneration package. There are both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs relate to the leaving costs, replacement costs and transitions costs, and indirect costs relate {{to the loss of}} production, reduced <b>performance</b> <b>levels,</b> unnecessary overtime and low morale. The true cost of turnover is going to depend on a number of variables including ease or difficulty in filling the position {{and the nature of the}} job itself. Estimating the costs of turnover within an organization can be a worthwhile exercise, especially since “turnover costs” are unlikely to appear in an organization’s balance sheets. Some of the direct costs can be readily calculated, while the indirect costs can often be more difficult to determine and may require “educated guesses.” Nevertheless, calculating even a rough idea of the total expenses relating to turnover can spur action planning within an organization to improve the work environment and reduce turnover. Surveying employees at the time they leave an organization can also be an effective approach to understanding the drivers of turnover within a particular organization.|$|E
