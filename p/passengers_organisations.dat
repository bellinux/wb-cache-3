40|$|Fatigue is an {{important}} workplace risk management issue. Within the rail industry, the passing of a stop signal (signal passed at danger; SPAD) {{is considered to be}} one of the most major safety breaches which can occur. Train drivers are very aware of the negative consequences associated with a SPAD. Therefore, SPADs provide a practical and applied safety relevant context within which to structure a discussion on fatigue. Focus groups discussing contributing factors to SPADs were undertaken at eight <b>passenger</b> rail <b>organisations</b> across Australia and New Zealand (n = 28 drivers). Data relating to fatigue was extracted and inductively analysed identifying three themes: causes, consequences, and countermeasures (to fatigue). Drivers experienced negative consequences of fatigue, despite existing countermeasures to mitigate it. Organisational culture was a barrier to effective fatigue management. A fatigue assessment tool consistently informed rostering, however, shift swapping was commonplace and often unregulated, reducing any potential positive impact. In discussing fatigue countermeasure strategies, drivers talked interchangeably about mitigating task related fatigue (e. g. increasing cognitive load) and sleepiness (e. g. caffeine).

40|$|The signal passed at danger (SPAD) is {{the rail}} {{equivalent}} of crashes and near-crashes in road. SPADs continue to impact collision risk on railways, despite {{the prevalence of}} technology-based countermeasures. This study explored the contribution of task-related distraction and inattention on SPAD-risk. A qualitative methodology was used to collect data from 28 train drivers in eight <b>passenger</b> rail <b>organisations</b> operating in Australia and New Zealand. The approach included focus groups and a scenario Invention Task to determine specific risks and identify amelioration strategies, effectively charactering the experience of distraction and inattention for the driver. Thematic analysis identified four factors that contributed to SPAD-risk. All were task-related, and associated with self regulatory disconnects in service delivery and in the driver-signal dynamic. Manifest distraction channelled through the factors by assigning primacy to non-safety critical driving goals. The findings are presented in a multifactorial model of distraction linking the risks with mechanisms that induced attentional shift. Three interrelating strategies for ameliorating these SPAD-risk factors were also identified. These were to prioritise goals, remain focused, and remember signal states. The paper conceptualises the driver distraction-inattention relationship in the rail context and considers the taxonomic implications of some subtle yet significant distinctions...|$|R
40|$|Background: In train driving, {{a signal}} passed at danger (SPAD) event is a {{significant}} mode of safe working failure that has implications for network safety, rail service delivery, and train driver welfare. Human-error related SPAD outcomes are frequently attributed to driver distraction, but very little rail research has sought to explore distractors that not only divert attention, but also subvert the regulation of safety-performance goals. Aim: The aim {{of this paper was}} to provide a better understanding of SPAD-risk factors from the perspective of task-related distraction in passenger train drivers operating in Australia and New Zealand. Method: Data were collected using a qualitative methodology that combined focus groups with a novel and generative technique designed to stimulate situational insight. In total, twenty-eight train drivers participated from 8 different <b>passenger</b> rail <b>organisations.</b> Data were analysed in a combined deductive and inductive thematic framework. Results: The data revealed several common risk factors to train driver distraction consistent with misprioritised attention. The experience of time-keeping pressure and station dwelling created tensions between safety and performance. These issues interacted with sighting restrictions to disconnect the driver from their route knowledge. Conclusion: The findings implicated significant SPAD-risk from task-related distraction, and suggested the experience of distraction was intensified when time-keeping pressure, station dwelling and sighting restrictions converged...|$|R

40|$|The {{incidence}} of driving a train through a stop signal {{continues to have}} implications for safety on railways. Industry rulebooks advise how to manage these events, {{but there has been}} very little investigation of causality from the systems-view. The increasing trend for maximising rail capacities could be exacerbating the issue and warrants investigation from this perspective to determine the factors impinging on safety decisions in train driving. A participative research approach incorporating cab rides, focus groups, and a generative scenario simulation exercise was used to investigate how train movements and safety risk was managed, and the implications of this on the rail organisation. Twenty-eight train drivers participated from eight <b>passenger</b> rail <b>organisations</b> across Australia and New Zealand. Inductive thematic analysis of the data revealed factors associated with (1) changes to signal meaning, (2) the nature of the driver-signal relationship, and (3) the confounding practice of asking a driver if they were ‘‘fit to continue’’ driving after going through a stop signal. The findings reflected a strong pattern of a normalisation of deviance. The results are discussed in terms of the mechanisms underlying the observed phenomenon and a model outlining prospective solutions for future research is presented to {{contribute to the development of}} novel ideas for further thinking and research...|$|R
40|$|Signal passed at danger (SPAD) events {{continue}} to impact safety-risk on rail networks, despite theintroduction of novel technologies aimed at addressing {{the cause and}} effect. This paper presents datafrom a study that set out to explore the key contributors to SPAD-risk. Focus groups were conductedwith train drivers from 8 urban <b>passenger</b> rail <b>organisations</b> across Australia and New Zealand using agenerative forward scenario simulation task to identify the specific risks and strategies being used toameliorate them. Distraction and inattention scenarios were most prevalent. A thematic analysis ofthese data found that time pressure and controller interactions increased {{the likelihood of a}} SPADoutcome, and this risk was intensified when the factors converged. The two factors were intrinsicallytask-related and associated with disconnects between service delivery and driver-signal dynamicswhere attention was not so much being diverted as ‘subverted’ by workgroup norms. The mosteffective strategy used to ameliorate these risks was task prioritisation. A conceptual model illustratingthe relationship between these risk factors and how inattention gave rise to distraction is given. Thisstudy illustrates the problems with self-regulation that may manifest from contributing factors that arealso work norms, and goes someway to unravelling the mystery behind SPADs that may be classifiedas ‘driver misjudged’ in metropolitan rail operations...|$|R
40|$|Background: A Signal Passed at Danger (SPAD) {{happens when}} a train passes a rail signal set to a stop {{indication}} and encroaches into railway where {{it does not have}} authority to be. In this respect, it is rather like a car going through a red light. SPAD events continue to impact safety risk on railways, despite the introduction of technologies aimed at addressing their cause and effect. Previous work has identified time pressure, and certain aspects of the way train drivers (Locomotive Engineers) and controllers (Dispatchers) interact, as key risk factors. Exposure to these could give rise to distraction and/or inattention from safe driving, distort service delivery requirements, and fundamentally alter the driver’s perception of risk. Purpose: This study undertook a new and more specialized analysis of existing data to investigate how drivers perceived time and conceptualized its loss and recovery within their driving task, and how they mitigated time pressure. Methods: Focus groups were conducted with train drivers from eight urban <b>passenger</b> rail <b>organisations</b> across Australia and New Zealand using a generative scenario simulation task. Results: Drivers had varying perspectives of time, either as a fixed aspect of the task, or as something that was uncontrollable. However, every driver perceived time as an aspect of the task that was being patrolled. Time pressure mitigation strategies associated with reprioritizing tasks and molding time were identified, both of which had specific relationships with other themes. A conceptual model is given integrating {{the findings of this study}} to previous work. Conclusions: Train drivers have diverse perspectives of the time requirement of their task, which influences their understanding of time loss and recovery. Whilst some strategies to mitigate time pressure aim to reprioritize sub-tasks, others aim to remove time requirements fromservice delivery goals altogether. The three time-related themes and related mitigated strategies were novel to the study conducted and reported in this manuscript...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} paper explores {{the manner in}} which <b>passenger</b> rail transit <b>organisations</b> plan for and manage unplanned service disruptions through an international survey of practices. This included semi-structured interviews of those staff responsible for service disruption management within 48 international passenger rail transit agencies. Results suggest that only 11 % of agencies had parallel transit systems which can be used for riders on disrupted services. Most of these were in inner urban contexts. Track intrusions/ medical emergencies, weather extremes, track and rolling stock failures were common causes of unplanned disruptions. Bus bridging was the most common response to line blockages whilst transfer of passengers to the next train was the most common approach to individual train rolling stock failures. Track crossovers were widely seen as critical to managing responses to disruptions, however, a small minority in mostly very cold and freezing climates also saw crossovers as a cause of unplanned failures. Most agencies used available spare buses to source bus bridging vehicles, however, just over 40 % actively retracted buses from existing scheduled bus services. It is rare for agencies to have a strategic reserve of buses for bus bridging purposes. The paper discusses the implications of the study findings for future research and practic...|$|R
40|$|M. Comm. The {{subject of}} the study {{is the way in which}} the coordinated marketing-logistics {{interface}} through the fourteen coordination techniques creates a sustainable competitive advantage. The investigation is limited to the passenger car manufactures in South Africa (SA). The literature has acknowledged that marketing and logistics are inseparable and managers from these functions have been working on the relationship in order to use it as a competitive advantage strategy. The fourteen marketing-logistics interface coordination techniques were identified in order to assist these managers to improve the interface and increase the level of cooperation with the intention of achieving a sustainable competitive through the interface. The use of fourteen marketing-logistics interface was not tested during the identification process of such techniques and it is important to find out if they are used in the passenger car industry in SA. Each of the fourteen coordination techniques differs on the basis of the level of use in the <b>passenger</b> car manufacturing <b>organisations.</b> Some techniques are mostly used in organisations than others. For example, top management support and information sharing are mostly used in these organisations while unified department and third-party intervention are not used and there is no plan to use them. There are techniques that have very high- to-high impact on the interface. It is important for the organisations to focus on those techniques that have very high and high impact on the interface since this can assist in improving cooperation between marketing and logistics and create the interface that can serve as a way to a sustainable competitive advantage. The level of cooperation between marketing and logistics functions in the manufacturing <b>organisations</b> in the <b>passenger</b> car industry was measured followed by questions relating to the use, the impact and the importance of the fourteen marketing-logistics interface coordination techniques in order to build and improve the cooperation and create a sustainable competitive advantage through the interface. Other techniques, except the predetermined fourteen techniques were identified however most respondents stated that organisations use the fourteen existing techniques. Some techniques such as a top management support, joint outings and information sharing were mostly used by organisations. It is interesting to note that mostly used does not imply that the technique has a high to very high impact on the interface. Although joint outing is mostly used it was found to have a moderate impact on the marketing-logistics interface. Recommendations provided should be applied in order to identify the difference in cooperation between marketing and logistics before and after the study. The marketing-logistics interface coordination can be a strategic tool for creating a sustainable competitive advantage if there is high level of cooperation between marketing and logistics through the use of coordination techniques...|$|R
