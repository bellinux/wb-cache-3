40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the effect of the length of the n-acyl portion on the autocatalytic thermal elimination reaction, five of the shorter members of the homologous series of <b>poly(vinyl</b> n-alkyl <b>esters)</b> (PV-n-AEs) {A figure is presented} were studied under identical experimental conditions; namely, by a static procedure at several temperatures. The -R group was varied from one to five carbon atoms. All the PV-n-AEs were obtained by chemical modification of a unique sample of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). Thus, by using a homologous series of PV-n-AEs with the same backbone molecular weight, any possible effect due to a change in molecular weight of the backbone and/or tacticity, structural chemical irregularities, etc., is eliminated. The shortest member of the series, i. e. poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) clearly degrades by an autocatalytic mechanism more readily than do longer ones. Thus, PVAc exhibits pure autocatalytic thermal degradation kinetics. On the contrary, the longest member of the series, <b>poly(vinyl</b> n-hexanoate <b>ester)</b> (PV-n-HE), degrades by very well defined first order kinetics. The other members of the series, poly(vinyl propionate) (PVPr), poly(vinyl butyrate) (PVBu) ≡ <b>poly(vinyl</b> n-butanoate <b>ester)</b> (PV-n-BE) and <b>poly(vinyl</b> valerate (PVVa) ≡ <b>poly(vinyl</b> n-pentanoate <b>ester)</b> (PV-n-PE) degrade by first order kinetics but with the participation, although to an insignificant extent, of the autocatalytic mechanism. For this and certain other reasons we have analyzed our experimental results by taking into account both types of mechanisms, separately. The three latter compounds followed first order rate kinetics quite well, the rate constants depending upon the n-alkyl chain length of the acyl portion. The energy of activation of the first order reaction decreases markedly as the length of the n-acyl portion increases. This decrease is neither constant nor regular as the acyl moeity increases in length but rather takes place in a quasi zig-zag fashion particularly with the longer members, suggesting an odd-even effect. On the basis of our experimental results we have arrived at the two following conclusions. Firstly, less stable <b>poly(vinyl</b> n-alkyl <b>esters),</b> i. e. <b>poly(vinyl</b> n-hexanoate <b>ester)</b> and, of course, higher members of the series which have not been investigated in the present work, would allow lower pyrolysis temperatures, thus increasing the synthetic applicability of this stripping reaction to the preparation of polyacetylene-like structures. Secondly, it was hoped that the kinetic study itself would shed more light on the mechanism of these decompositions in high molecular weight compounds. © 1989. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{the first of a series}} on the pyrolyses of <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>esters)</b> in which the {{kinetics}} of the isothermal degradation up to high conversions of five unfractionated heterotactic samples of poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) ranging in viscosity-average molecular weight Mv from 3 · 7 × 104 to 2 · 4 × 105 has been investigated by a static procedure in a nitrogen atmosphere over a wide temperature range. The experimental results can be explained by assuming the occurrence of a catalyzed deacetylation reaction which is first order with respect to CH 3 COOH simultaneously with an uncatalyzed reaction. This kinetic model, based on the stripping mechanism, has been shown to be in very good agreement with the experimental data not only for low, but also for moderately high, degrees of conversion. Rate constants k 1 and k 2, Arrhenius parameters E and A and ΔS≠ values have been determined for both the autocatalyzed and uncatalyzed elimination reactions. They are reasonable, since they compare quite favorably with those taking place by a unimolecular dissociation mechanism in homogeneous gas-phase reactions of simple ester molecules which we can consider as model substances for our stripping elimination reaction. The dependence of the kinetic parameters of the samples on molecular weight has been interpreted. © 1988. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The present PhD thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of oligomeric <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>esters)</b> as additives for the preparation of ductile poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) barrier materials with low oxygen permeability by melt compounding. In order to synthesize the <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>esters)</b> exhibiting an aliphatic side chain length of 2 – 18 carbon atoms and degrees of polymerization of 10 and 20, the telomerization of vinyl esters using carbon tetrachloride as chain transfer agent proved to be a convenient method. The thermal properties of these chlorinated oligomers were significantly affected by the side chain length. It was highly important that the use of a longer side chain increased drastically the resistance to degradation resulting in stable oligomers from a length of 8 carbon atoms. In contrast, a reduction became necessary to stabilize the chlorinated poly(vinyl acetate). Oligomeric poly(vinyl acetate) with a degree of polymerization of 10 presented an efficient plasticizer for brittle, commercial PVAc during melt mixing in a microcompounder and acted as compatibilizer to improve the dispersion of an organically modified layered silicate in the PVAc matrix. The latter was based on its low molecular weight leading to a lower radius of gyration compared to the interlayer spacing of the filler. At this, the masterbatch method presented the most successful approach for the compounding with the layered silicate. Using this method, plasticized nanocomposites with a significantly higher oxygen barrier than the pure poly(vinyl acetate) were obtained up to a filler content of 7. 5 wt %. Therefore, the study demonstrates that ductile PVAc materials with low oxygen permeability can be prepared via two-step melt compounding (masterbatch method) using oligomeric poly(vinyl acetate) as additive and layered silicate as nanofiller. In case of poly(vinyl acetate), this approach opens up new fields of application since it eliminates the brittleness of PVAc and, unlike the conventional use of PVAc in dispersions, is solvent-free and compatible with current industrial processes. For example, the plasticized PVAc films provide a promising alternative for barrier materials due to the good thermoplastic processability of PVAc and lower oxygen permeability in comparison to polyolefins. However, it has {{to be taken into account}} that an exfoliation was not achieved. The PVAc-layered silicate nanocomposites could not substitute the common barrier polymers in terms of oxygen barrier properties due to higher O 2 permeability. In addition, a scale-up, a more precise migration analysis of the oligomer and a review of the regulations for nanoparticles will be inevitable for a commercialization of the PVAc materials. Nevertheless, due to the advantages of extrusion processing, the masterbatch method used in this work presents an interesting way to enhance the compatibility of a polymer matrix with layered silicates and simultaneously ensure its effective plasticization by the addition of an oligomer with chemical constitution being identical to the matrix. This could provide an attractive approach for other commercially important polymers and should be extensively investigated in the future...|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} to surface modification of materials has been formulated and explored in great detail. It was shown that polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) quickly and irreversibly adsorbs to hydrophobic surfaces producing smooth, continuous, hydrophilic, robust films in the thickness range of tens of angstroms. Surfaces of all hydrophobic materials studied could be successfully turned hydrophilic by this adsorption, which is performed from dilute aqueous solutions of PVOH. The ultra-thin films of adsorbed PVOH were studied by means of contact angle, ellipsometry, XPS, AFM, FT-IR, and DSC. Adsorption conditions, such as time, polymer concentration and molecular weight, temperature, salt type and concentration, and polymer composition all {{have an effect on}} the properties of the adsorbed film. The unique character of PVOH irreversible adsorption among other water-soluble polymers is explained by polymer crystallization that occurs concurrently with adsorption. Crystallinity within adsorbed films is demonstrated by the means of FT-IR and DSC. Chemical properties of adsorbed PVOH were studied, and a number of synthetic procedures were developed for further modification of PVOH ultra-thin films. Cross-linking of adsorbed PVOH imparted great stability in hot water. PVOH in the ultra-thin films was successfully converted into a variety of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>esters</b> and urethanes; polyethylene glycol was grafted “to” and “from” these films. Prospective applications of PVOH adsorption and its ultra-thin films were studied. Improved adhesion in glued joints of polyethylene was demonstrated when PVOH was pre-adsorbed on PE before applying adhesive. PVOH adsorption and subsequent PEG grafting significantly reduced protein adsorption on a hydrophobic surface. A possibility to create defined features on PVOH surface by chemical patterning was demonstrated. A novel design of vapor sensing devices based on the adsorbed and modified PVOH was proposed and studied in detail. It was shown that remarkable reproducibility in PVOH adsorption on surface acoustic wave devices can be achieved and that further chemistry of the adsorbed films permits the preparation of sensitive and selective vapor sensors. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Polyvinyl</b> alkyl <b>ester</b> of {{carboxylic}} acids are {{a family}} of macromolecules in which the side chain esters (pendant groups) increase in molar mass and hydrophobicity and decrease in structural polarity {{as the number of}} carbons in the carboxylic acid increases. The most important polymer in this family is Polyvinyl Acetate (PVAc). The Solubility Parameter (δ) is a unique physical property of any polymeric material and can be a useful guide to understanding the miscibility or compatibility of two polymeric substances. It is therefore essential in working with polymeric blends of PVAc that the experimental solubility parameter be accurately and precisely known. We have experimentally determined the solubility parameter of food grade PVAc by measuring the intrinsic viscosity of several different molecular weight PVAc samples (ranging from 11 K- 75 K Daltons) in four different solvents (acetone, methanol, tetrahydrofuran, toluene,) at 25 °C using glass capillary viscometry. We also estimated the solubility parameter using the principles of group additivity contribution due to the atoms, groups and bonds present in PVAc based on the theories of Small, Hoy, and Van Krevelen. The Mark-Houwink constants for PVAC in the four solvents were also experimentally determined. Our experimentally determined solubility parameter was 9. 35 (cal/cm 3) 1 / 2 which compared well with the computational values obtained by Hoy (9. 56), Small (9. 45) and Va...|$|R

Similarly, polymer derived from phospholipid monomer 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -[12 -(acryloyloxy)dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphorylcholine exhibits reduced platelet deposition and has been applied as biomaterial for cardiovascular repair (Marra et al. 1997). Phosphate-based polymers have also received critical attention for their role in biomineralization process for bone tissue engineering. This is inspired from the natural biomineralization process wherein phosphate moieties attached to phospholipids, phosphoproteins and phopsphoproteoglycans act as nucleation sites for hydroxyapatite formation and also control mineral morphologies (Collier and Messersmith 2001; George and Veis 2008; He et al. 2005; Hunter and Goldberg 1993; Wise et al. 2007). In addition, many regulatory signals of the body are controlled by phoshphorylation of key proteins either present in form of growth factors or matrix-bound scaffold proteins (Alessi et al. 1997; Good et al. 2011; Van Hoof et al. 2009). Apart from above applications, phosphate groups grafted to polymer backbones have also been demonstrated to improve function of osteoblast cells and augment performance of bone grafts (Sailaja et al. 2009; Xu et al. 2011). In our previous studies, we have also observed that phosphate groups grafted on polyvinyl alcohol and chitosan show markedly improved osteoblast like cell proliferation compared to their parent non phosphorylated polymers (Datta et al. 2013). In this study, we further wanted to investigate if the improvements in cell functionalities are correlated with the degree of phosphate modification and what types of relationship exist between the polymers modified to different degrees of phosphate content and cell behavior.|$|R
