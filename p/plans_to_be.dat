5|$|Plans to have trams {{run through}} the city center have existed since 1919. In the late 1940s, Holmenkolbanen revised the plan, and {{proposed}} extending the Common Tunnel eastwards. From 1951, the municipality started working on plans for the Oslo Metro {{in the eastern part}} of the city. The large difference in traffic between the eastern and western lines caused the <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> changed during the 1960s, and the eastern network was equipped with third rail power supply. The eastern lines at first terminated at Jernbanetorget, and the plans were to continue the lines onwards towards Bislett. But by the 1970s, these plans changed, largely because of the increase of traffic in the west and decrease in the east. On 7 March 1987, the services from the west, including the Røa Line, were extended from Nationaltheatret to Stortinget, a station that allowed transfer to the metro.|$|E
5|$|Some Denver streets have bicycle lanes, {{leaving a}} {{patchwork}} of disjointed routes throughout the city. There are over 850 miles of paved, off-road, bike paths in Denver parks and along bodies of water, like Cherry Creek and the South Platte. This allows for {{a significant portion of}} Denver's population to be bicycle commuters and has led to Denver being known as a bicycle-friendly city. Some local residents are very opposed to bike lanes, which have caused some <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> watered down or nixed. The review process for one bike line on Broadway will last over a year before city council members will make a decision. In addition to the many bike paths, Denver launched B-Cycle– a citywide bicycle sharing program– in late April 2010.
