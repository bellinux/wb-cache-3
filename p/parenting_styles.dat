Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, <b>parenting</b> <b>styles,</b> sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.|$|E

40|$|Despite broad {{consensus}} {{about the effects}} of parenting practices on child development, many questions about the construct <b>parenting</b> <b>style</b> remain unanswered. Particularly pressing issues are the variability in the effects of <b>parenting</b> <b>style</b> {{as a function of the}} child's cultural background, the processes through which <b>parenting</b> <b>style</b> influences the child's development, and the operational-ization of <b>parenting</b> <b>style.</b> Drawing on historical review, the authors present a model that integrates two traditions in socialization research, the study of specific parenting practices and the study of global parent characteristics.

2500|$|Research {{has shown}} that the {{relationship}} between parent and child distress may be influenced by parenting psychological flexibility. When parents are psychologically inflexible they cause more stress in their families. [...] A similar study looked at the longitudinal relationship between perceived parenting style and psychological flexibility among students over six years (7th-12th Grade). [...] Results showed that psychological flexibility decreased with age, illustrating that as children grow older they become more set in their thoughts and habits, being less likely to change them due to circumstances. [...] Results also indicated that authoritarian <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> predicted low psychological flexibility in children. [...] This demonstrates that parents who over-control their children tend to restrict how well their children cope with stressors in life. [...] Lastly, results showed that children with psychological flexibility in 9th grade {{were more likely to have}} decreases in authoritarian and increases in authoritative parenting style later on. [...] Authoritative <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> seem to be associated with psychological flexibility in children. [...] Authoritative parents tend to be more warm, fair, and encouraging than other <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> which may be why children raised by this style have more psychological flexibility.

[...] Responsive teaching is an early intervention curriculum designed to address the cognitive, language, and social needs of young children with developmental problems. [...] Based on the principle of “active learning”, responsive teaching is a method that is currently being applauded as adaptable for individual caregivers, children and their combined needs [...] The effect of <b>parenting</b> <b>styles</b> on the development of children is an important area of research that seems to be forever ongoing and altering.

RESULTS—An authoritative paternal <b>parenting</b> <b>style</b> predicted better glycemic control and adherence in the child; a permissive maternal <b>parenting</b> <b>style</b> predicted poor adherence.

40|$|Background: The {{authoritative}} <b>parenting</b> <b>style</b> {{is linked}} with greater academic competence {{in children and}} it provides an optimal environment {{for the development of}} self-regulation of children. Parents with an authoritative <b>parenting</b> <b>style</b> are more consistent and are also sensitive to their child’s specific needs during parentchild interactions. Therefore, the authoritative <b>parenting</b> <b>style</b> has a positive influence on the interaction skills of parents during parent-child interactions. Besides parents, pre-school teachers {{play an important role in}} the development of children. Aim: The aim of this study is to determine whether the authoritative <b>parenting</b> <b>style</b> of pre-school teachers in child day care influences their interaction skills in interacting with children between 2 and 4 years of age, in particular the interaction skills in Facilitating of learning and development and Behaviour guidance.
