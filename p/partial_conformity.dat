40|$|In this work, an {{optimization}} based approach {{presented in}} previous {{work of the}} authors for Discrete Fracture Network simulations is coupled with the Virtual Element Method (VEM) for the space discretization of the underlying Darcy law. The great ﬂexibility of the VEM in allowing rather general polygonal elements, allow to easily describe irregular solutions starting from a general triangulation which can be built independently of the mesh on other fractures. Only a <b>partial</b> <b>conformity</b> is in fact obtained with this approach. Numerical results performed on several DFN conﬁgurations conﬁrm the viability and eﬃciency of the resulting method...|$|E
30|$|The study {{focussed}} on the asymptotic {{performance of}} the QDF under correlated and uncorrelated normally distributed training samples. Under this distribution, the {{performance of the}} QDF under varying sampling ratios, selected number of variables and different group centroid separators were extensively studied. The QDF recorded minimum misclassification error rates and high variability as the sample size increased asymptotically under correlated normal distribution, thereby increasing the accuracy of classification of observations with the function. The performance of the QDF deteriorated when the sample size ratio was 1 : 2 : 3 as δ increased with increasing sample size. However, {{the performance of the}} function was appreciably good under both correlated and uncorrelated normal distributions when their estimated average misclassification error rate decreased with increasing number of variables (from 4 to 8). This results shows some <b>partial</b> <b>conformity</b> with the study of Lawoko (1988) where the researcher found that the efficiency of the QDF and other classifiers are generally lowered by positively correlated training observations. Generally, the study found that, the QDF performed better resulting in the reduction in misclassification error rates as group centroid separator increases with non increasing sample size and under correlated training samples. This results therefore shows some <b>partial</b> <b>conformity</b> with the studies by Marks in 1974. Marks approached the problem of discrimination by comparing the performance of QDF with other classifiers. Although he considered only two populations, the QDF performance was abysmal under small sample size selection when covariance matrices were nearly equal with large dimensions.|$|E

Its specific character constitutes a need of unusual approach in its regulation and supervision. In general, regulation is goal-directed effort to construct consistent framework of rules, which moderates behavior of regulated entities. Supervision is continuous inspection of such behavior and penalizing infringements of defined rules. This paper's intention is to contribute to debate on purposes, means and extend of execution {{of financial}} market's regulation in Czech Republic. Nature of financial market, especially its progress dynamic, makes this intention difficult to fill. Every specific financial market requires unique solution of regulation framework's construction. Nevertheless similar trends can be recognized on them. This <b>partial</b> <b>conformity</b> enable to create several types of regulatory framework, which can be applied to number of markets. Law is a basic instrument of financial market's regulation. Economic nature of financial market necessitates consistent comparison of legal acts' interpretation with market's true needs. Flexibility of regulation framework is crucial factor of its efficiency. Its system should be able to [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} general {{election}} outcomes {{can be helped}} by finding better approaches for visualizing large quantities of information and asking questions about its patterning. We review the Nagayama or ‘all possibilities' triangle display, and show that it can only legitimately be used to show an overall ‘field’ of results that is logically feasible, called the effective space of competition, which varies {{with the number of}} observable parties. We apply this reductionist view to analysing outcomes in three leading plurality rule systems (the USA, India and Great Britain), focusing on evidence of the Duvergerian psychological effect acting on voters during campaign periods. The Effective Competition Space view illuminates some key differences across countries, and variations with rising numbers of parties competing. We next consider a more holistic approach, the ‘crown’ diagram, which links electoral district outcomes more closely to the most important politico-ideological dimension in each country. Both views suggest some tentative evolutionary hypotheses for the variegated development of plurality rule systems over time. Britain is a highly nationalized party system, but one that has moved substantially away from Duvergerian predictions of two-party focusing, and towards multiparty politics. The USA seems to be a case of ‘stunted development’. India shows a <b>partial</b> Duvergerian <b>conformity,</b> yet combined with a substantial vertical scatter of non-Duvergerian results. Applications to over-time and regional analysis within countries are also sketched...|$|R
40|$|The {{persistence}} of the book-tax gap, or excess of companies’ reported financial accounting income over their taxable income, suggests that accounting manipulation and tax sheltering remain significant problems, even {{in the aftermath of}} the “Enron era. ” Some have therefore suggested making the United States a “one-book” country, in which the same income measure would be used for both purposes. This Article offers the first systematic exploration of the optimal relationship between the two income measures, based on the distinct purposes they serve and the significance of two distinct sets of incentive problems: those pertaining to corporate managers, and to the political decisionmakers who make the rules. Absent these incentive problems, the two ideal measures would differ, reflecting that allocating tax burdens is not the same exercise as informing investors. The incentive problems cut in favor of uniformity, however, by supporting the creation of a “Madisonian” offset between managers’ and politicians’ twin quests for high accounting income and low taxable income. But this offset has more promise as a device to constrain managers than politicians, given the difficulty of binding Congress and the existing partial insulation of accounting rules from direct political influence. In light of the political incentive issues, pure one-book and two-book approaches may both be inferior to <b>partial</b> <b>conformity,</b> such as that which would result from generally requiring a 50 percent adjustment by large, publicly traded companies of taxable income towards financial accounting income...|$|E
40|$|The {{starting}} point {{of this article is}} the comparison of selected aspects of Czech and Japanese spa industries, especially the historical roots, the legislative framework, the development of num- ber of spas in recent decades and the concept of traditional Czech a Japanese Spa Industry. The spa industry gains the importance in the context of changing lifestyles, development so- -called health tourism and finally with a dynamically increasing rate of population aging. Using of geothermal or mineral springs for therapeutic purposes is possible to see today in the territory of the present Czech Republic since 12 th century. Approximately from the same time re- ferences to monitored Japanese onsen are available. Classification criteria for spas and onsen are very similar. a certain (but not identical) legal form exists of these spas. Specifics of spas in the Czech Republic and traditional spa in Japan show a strong linking to the aspects preferred within promoting corporate social responsibility (CSR). A survey that was made was focused on i) identifying way of the perception of various aspects of CSR in the spa / onsen, ii) identifying way of the perception of various aspects of CSR by the public authority („government“) in the spa resort, iii) comparing the level of conformity of both types of groups in the Czech Republic, and iv) comparing the results of the survey of Czech spas, Czech spa resorts and Japanese onsen in order to identify conformity and differences in the groups. Results show that there are differences in the level of overall perception of aspects of CSR in the Czech Republic and in Japan, differences {{from the point of view}} of ordinal perception of various areas and from the point of understanding of the strengths and weaknesses in appraisal of chosen detailed factors. On the other hand, there are certain elements of conformity or <b>partial</b> <b>conformity</b> of perception of various areas and factors of CSR in two such distant countries such as Japan and the Czech Republic, especially in the sector, that has the same natural and medical basis but a different cultural background and realistic method of operation...|$|E
