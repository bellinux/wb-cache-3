5|$|Whether Neferhotep I usurped {{the throne}} {{at the expense}} of Sobekhotep III or {{inherited}} it, he possibly acceded to power over a fragmented Egypt. The Egyptologist Kim Ryholt believes that the Canaanite 14th Dynasty was already in existence at the time, forming an independent realm controlling at least the Eastern Nile Delta. This could explain why Neferhotep's only attestation in Lower Egypt is a single scarab seal. While this analysis is accepted by some scholars, among whom are Gae Callender, Janine Bourriau and Darrell Baker, it is rejected by others, including Manfred Bietak, Daphna Ben-Tor and James and Susan Allen, who contend that Neferhotep I reigned over the whole of Egypt. Possible vindications of this are the several attestations of Neferhotep found northeast of Egypt, in the Levant, in particular the stela of the Governor of Byblos Yantinu and 4 scarab seals from Canaan, indicating that he retained enough <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> trade relations with this region.|$|E

The four most senior officers of Northern origin were also killed. It was alleged to be an Igbo coup because Nnamdi Azikiwe, the President, of Igbo extraction, and the premier of the southeastern {{part of the country}} were not killed and the commander of the army, General Aguiyi Ironsi seized <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> order.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} control costs, Honda {{decided not to}} include the electric-assist air {{conditioning}} compressor used in the Civic Hybrid. The Civic Hybrid's electric-assist allows the air conditioning compressor to continue running (using battery pack <b>power)</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> cabin temperature when the engine is shut off in Idle Stop mode. Instead, the Insight limits {{the duration of the}} Idle Stop mode during air conditioning use and restarts the engine, when needed, to maintain cabin temperature. However, when the Insight's ECON function is engaged, a longer Idle Stop time is invoked for improved fuel efficiency at the expense of rapid cabin cooling. In other words, the air conditioning stops whenever the car stops, as in stop-and-go traffic. During Idle Stop the blower continues to run albeit at a low speed.|$|E
25|$|Under the empire, the {{citizens}} {{were divided into}} three classes, and for members of each class, a distinct career path was available (known as the cursus honorum). The traditional magistracies were only available to citizens of the senatorial class. The magistracies that survived {{the fall of the}} republic were (by their order of rank per the cursus honorum) the Consulship, Praetorship, Plebeian Tribunate, Aedileship, Quaestorship, and Military Tribunate. If an individual was not of the senatorial class, he could run for one of these offices if he was allowed to run by the emperor, or otherwise, he could be appointed to one of these offices by the emperor. During the transition from republic to empire, no office lost more power or prestige than the Consulship, which was due, in part, {{to the fact that the}} substantive powers of republican Consuls were all transferred to the emperor. Imperial Consuls could preside over the senate, could act as judges in certain criminal trials, and had control over public games and shows. The Praetors also lost a great deal of power, and ultimately had little authority outside of the city. The chief Praetor in Rome, the Urban Praetor, outranked all other Praetors, and for a brief time, they were given power over the treasury. Under the empire, the Plebeian Tribunes remained sacrosanct, and, in theory at least, retained the power to summon, or to veto, the senate and the assemblies. Augustus divided the college of Quaestors into two divisions, and assigned one division the task of serving in the senatorial provinces, and the other the task of managing civil administration in Rome. Under Augustus, the Aediles lost control over the grain supply to a board of commissioners. It wasn't until after they lost the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> order in the city, however, that they truly became powerless, and the office disappeared entirely during the 3rd century.|$|E
500|$|Accommodation is {{the process}} by which the eye {{increases}} optical <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> focus on the retina while shifting its gaze to a closer point. The long-standing medical consensus is that this is accomplished by action of the ciliary muscle, a muscle within the eye, which adjusts the curvature of the eye's crystalline lens. This explanation is based in the observed effect of atropine temporarily preventing accommodation when applied to the ciliary muscle, as well as images reflected on the crystalline lens becoming smaller as the eye shifts focus to a closer point, indicating a change in the lens' shape. Bates rejected this explanation, and in his 1920 book presented photographs that he said showed that the image remained the same size even as the eye shifted focus, concluding from this that the lens was not a factor in accommodation. However, optometrist Philip Pollack in a 1956 work characterized these photographs as [...] "so blurred {{that it is impossible to}} tell whether one image is larger than the other", in contrast to later photographs that clearly showed a change in the size of the reflected images, just as had been observed since the late nineteenth century.|$|E

[...] President Woodrow Wilson, speaking from Montana, branded the walkout [...] "a crime against civilization" [...] that left the city [...] "at the mercy of an army of thugs." [...] He said that [...] "the obligation of a policeman is as sacred and direct as the obligation of a soldier. He is a public servant, not a private employee, and the whole honor of the community is in his hands. He has no right to prefer any private advantage to the public safety." [...] Elihu Root, a former Secretary of War and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, told a Carnegie Hall audience on September 17 that the strike was an attack on constitutional government because it represented [...] "the passing of power to enforce laws, the power to punish crime, the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> order from the whole people of the United States" [...] to the 3% of the population represented by the AFL.|$|E

2500|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the usefulness of}} these reactions, {{in addition to the}} reactants, the products, and the energy released, one needs to know something about the cross section. Any given fusion device has a maximum plasma pressure it can sustain, and an economical device would always operate near this maximum. Given this pressure, the largest fusion output is obtained when the temperature is chosen so that /T2 is a maximum. This is also the temperature at which the value of the triple product nTτ required for ignition is a minimum, since that required value is inversely proportional to /T2 (see Lawson criterion). (A plasma is [...] "ignited" [...] if the fusion reactions produce enough <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> the temperature without external heating.) This optimum temperature and the value of /T2 at that temperature is given for a few of these reactions in the following table.|$|E
