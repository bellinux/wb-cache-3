50|$|Peer-to-peer carsharing {{is a form}} of <b>person-to-person</b> <b>lending</b> or {{collaborative}} consumption, as part of {{the sharing}} economy. The business model is closely aligned with traditional car clubs such as Streetcar or Zipcar, but replaces a typical fleet with a ‘virtual’ fleet made up of vehicles from participating owners. With peer-to-peer carsharing, participating car owners are able to charge a fee to rent out their vehicles when they are not using them. Participating renters can access nearby and affordable vehicles and pay only for the time they need to use them.|$|E

50|$|Dealing with {{financial}} securities {{is connected to}} the problem about ownership: in case of person-to-person loans, the problem of who owns the loans (notes) and how that ownership is transferred between the originator of the loan (the <b>person-to-person</b> <b>lending</b> company) and the individual lender(s). This question arises especially when a peer-to-peer lending company does not merely connect lenders and borrowers but also borrows money from users and then lends it out again. Such activity is interpreted as a sale of securities, and a broker-dealer license and the registration of the person-to-person investment contract is required for the process to be legal. The license and registration can be obtained at a securities regulatory agency such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the U.S., the Ontario Securities Commission in Ontario, Canada, the Autorité des marchés financiers in France and Québec, Canada, or the Financial Services Authority in the UK.|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Over the last decade, Internet-based platforms have emerged that allow individuals to lend money to other individuals {{in what has become}} known as <b>person-to-person</b> <b>lending.</b> These online platforms present a new source of credit for borrowers and a potential investment opportunity for those with capital to lend. Both for-profit and nonprofit options exist, allowing for income-generating and philanthropic lending to a variety of people and groups around the world. The Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act directed GAO to conduct a study of person-toperson lending. This report addresses (1) how the major <b>person-to-person</b> <b>lending</b> platforms operate and how lenders and borrowers use them; (2) the key benefits and risks to borrowers and lenders and the current system for overseeing these risks; and (3) {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the current and alternative regulatory approaches. To do this work, GAO reviewed relevant literature, analyzed regulatory proceedings and filings, and interviewed federal and state officials and representatives of the three major <b>person-to-person</b> <b>lending</b> platforms currently operating in the United States. GAO assessed options for regulating <b>person-to-person</b> <b>lending</b> using a framework previously developed for evaluating proposals for financial regulatory reform. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Securities and Exchange Commission provided written comments on the report, and they all noted the need to continue to monitor the development of the industry. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{estimate}} {{risk aversion}} {{from the actual}} financial decisions of 2, 168 investors in Lending Club (LC), a <b>person-to-person</b> <b>lending</b> platform. We develop a methodology {{that allows us to}} estimate risk aversion parameters from each portfolio choice. Since the same individual makes repeated investments, we are able to construct a panel of risk aversion parameters that we use to disentangle heterogeneity in attitudes towards risk from the elasticity of investor-specific risk aversion to changes in wealth. In the cross section, we find that wealthier investors are more risk averse. Using changes in house prices as a source of variation, we find that investors become more risk averse after a negative wealth shock. These preferences consistently extrapolate to other investor decisions within LC. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{advances}} {{the first}} historically informed typology of housing finance systems. Using a novel collection of historical mortgage-market data, we identify four different ‘ideal type’ systems, {{which developed in}} mature economies when organised housing finance institutions began to emerge with the advance of industrialism and urbanism throughout the long nineteenth century: informal <b>person-to-person</b> <b>lending,</b> and state lending as solutions outside specialised banking circuits; and deposit-based and bond-based institutions as banking solutions. We adapt Alexander Gerschenkron's economic backwardness thesis in order to explain the temporal and spatial emergence of these distinct types, arguing that these systems created path-dependent logics, which made their influence felt over a century later.

40|$|Abstract: We {{analyze the}} role of {{intermediaries}} on electronic markets using detailed data of more than 14, 000 originated loans on an electronic P 2 P (<b>person-to-person)</b> <b>lending</b> platform. On such an electronic credit market lenders bid for supplying a private loan. Screening of potential borrowers and the monitoring of loan repayment can be delegated to designated group leaders. We find that these market participants act as financial intermediaries and significantly improve borrowers ’ credit conditions. As suggested by traditional intermediation theory (e. g. Diamond 1984; Leland and Pyle 1976), the intermediary creates value by reducing information asymmetries between borrowers and lenders. Our findings are robust to self-selection and characteristics of the financial transactions, and may be surprising given the long discussion on disintermediation due to electronic marketplaces...|$|E
40|$|<b>Person-to-Person</b> <b>lending</b> (P 2 PL) {{is a new}} and {{exciting}} Internet application. Currently, there is limited understanding {{of the behavior of}} P 2 PL markets and their participants because of the uniqueness and youth of these markets. In this paper, we make the case that lenders’ search for listings to bid on {{is an integral part of}} lender behavior, and analyses of P 2 PL that do not give explicit consideration to the nature of this search may very well draw inappropriate conclusions. This paper presents empirical evidence which supports the notion that P 2 P lenders conduct search. We also analyze a simple model of optimal search in P 2 PL markets. In the context of this model we introduce the concept of a search premium, which is the difference between the interest rate borrowers would pay in a market with costless search and the minimum interest rate they must offer to induce search. ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, online <b>person-to-person</b> <b>lending,</b> also called {{peer-to-peer}} or P 2 P lending, {{emerged as an}} alternative form of consumer borrowing and investing. It grew throughout the recession, even as consumer credit markets faltered, {{and it continues to}} grow today. P 2 P lending platforms match individuals looking to borrow with individuals looking to lend in anonymous online marketplaces. They offer attractive interest rates, debt consolidation, access to liquidity, and inexpensive diversification. Despite its growth, however, the P 2 P lending market faces significant challenges. In 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (2 ̆ 2 SEC 2 ̆ 2) declared that notes issued by P 2 P lending platforms to be unregistered securities. This forced the platforms-as web startups-to register for initial public offerings. SEC regulation now creates substantial compliance costs, barriers to entry, and risks to consumers in the P 2 P lending market. P 2 P lending should therefore be exempted from SEC regulation and placed under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (2 ̆ 2 CFPB 2 ̆ 7) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{estimate}} {{risk aversion}} {{from the actual}} 8 ̆ 5 nancial decisions of a sample of 2, 168 U. S. in-vestors participating in Lending Club, a <b>person-to-person</b> <b>lending</b> platform. We 8 ̆ 5 nd a large degree of heterogeneity in the relative risk aversion (RRA) parameter, {{with an average of}} 2. 85, and a median of 1. 62. We exploit the panel dimension of the data to estimate independ-ently the correlation between risk aversion and wealth in the cross section of investors, and the elasticity of risk aversion with respect to changes in wealth for a given investor. Using house prices as an indicator of investor wealth, we 8 ̆ 5 nd a positive although economically small, correlation between relative risk aversion and wealth in the cross section. In contrast, exploiting the substantial decline in house prices during our sample period and employing investor xed e¤ect to obtain within-investor estimates, we 8 ̆ 5 nd that the elasticity is neg-ative and substantial (- 4. 18). Our estimation procedure allows us to test rationality and consistency of investor behavior. We are grateful to Lending Club for providing the data and for helpful discussions on this project.

40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that the {{complexion}} of housing finance systems in OECD countries, both now and historically, has a significant bearing {{on a number of}} core housing-related indicators, including housing form, tenure composition, and urban development. Existing literature in the fields of housing studies and comparative political economy, however, has often neglected the historical dynamics of housing finance, while contemporaneously, financial historians have focused almost exclusively on company and not mortgage finance. We identify four different "ideal types" of housing finance systems that developed in mature capitalist economies when organized housing finance institutions began to emerge throughout the long nineteenth century: informal <b>person-to-person</b> <b>lending</b> and state lending as solutions outside specialized banking circuits, and deposit-based and bond-based institutions as banking solutions. We adapt Alexander Gerschenkron's theory of economic backwardness in order to explain the temporal-spatial emergence of these distinct types. We draw a path-dependent conclusion, noting that the more countries developed bond-based mortgage banks in the nineteenth century, the more they tended towards multi-story building structure, low homeownership rates and lower securitization levels in the twentieth century. A collection of unique historical city and country data supports these findings. In diesem Artikel behaupten wir, dass heutige und historische Wohnfinanzsysteme in OECD-L 4 ndern einen starken Einfluss auf eine Reihe zentraler Wohnungsindikatoren wie die Bauform, die Wohneigentumsstruktur und die st 4 dtische Entwicklung hatten. Die Literatur des Wohnungswesens und der Vergleichenden Politischen 6 konomie hat die historische Wohnfinanzentwicklung bisher stiefm behandelt, w 4 hrend Finanzhistoriker sich fast ausschlie auf Unternehmens- und nicht Hypothekenfinanzierung konzentriert haben. Wir identifizieren vier verschiedene Idealtypen der Wohnfinanzregime, die sich in entwickelten 6 konomien im zum organisierten Realkredit im langen 19. Jahrhundert entwickelten: informelle personale Kredite und Staatskredite als Typen au von Banken, einlagen- und pfandbrieffinanzierte Typen von Hypothekenbanken. Wir nutzen Alexander Gerschenkrons Theorie der 6 konomischen R 4 ndigkeit, um die raumzeitlich unterschiedliche Entstehung dieser Typen zu erkl 4 ren, und ziehen einen pfadabh 4 ngigen Schluss: Je mehr L 4 nder im 19. Jahrhundert pfandbrieffinanzierte Hypothekenbanken entwickelten, desto mehr haben sie damals wie heute Mehrgeschossst 4 dte und desto niedriger ist bis heute ihre Wohneigentumsquote sowie ihr Umlauf an hypothekenbesicherten Wertpapieren.
