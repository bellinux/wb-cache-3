50|$|The {{events of}} the Hamidian massacres and Sultan Abdul Hamid II's {{continued}} anti-Armenian policies gave way for the Armenian Revolutionary Federation to plan an assassination attempt on the sultan to enact vengeance.

Christapor Mikaelian, alongside his friend Vramshabouh Kendirian, died in an accidental explosion. Despite losing the instigators of the operation, it continued as planned.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{before the}} war started among the many designs {{initiated}} by the Drawing Office was one known as the 'Hydravion', based {{on the notion that}} an aeroplane should be able to take off from water as well as from land. Floats, made of Duralumin, made at the Dartford works were tested in the nearby River Darent. Archives at the company headquarters imply that the Hydravion was to be constructed at Dartford, despite the factory only <b>producing</b> <b>explosives</b> and projectiles at the time.|$|E
50|$|Arsenal Park Transilvania is {{an outdoor}} theme park in Orăştie, Hunedoara County, and {{reportedly}} Romania's largest exclusive retreat. It was opened in June 2009 {{and is the}} only military themed park in the country {{and one of the few}} in Europe. The theme park is located on a 80 ha plot of land and it involved total investments of US$14 million. The location is the former site of an arsenal factory, Rompiro Orăştie specialised in <b>producing</b> <b>explosives,</b> land mines and ammunition, now a four star resort owned by the Timişoara based Bega Group. At completion the theme park will total US$26 million of investments.|$|E
50|$|In the 20th century, {{the town}} was a major base for Nobel Industries and later ICI, whose Ardeer site {{employed}} many thousands of workers <b>producing</b> <b>explosives</b> and chemicals. ICI added a nylon plant in the 1960s which had a short lived production life, and a nitric acid plant. The closure of these facilities, along with the general decline in ICI's presence in the town has had a devastating long-term effect on the town's economy. The site is now owned by Inabata, a Japanese trading firm, and operates as Nobel Enterprises. The energetic technologies {{side of the business}} is now owned by Chemring Ltd, with the nitrocellulose manufacture retained under Nobel Enterprises. To the south of Stevenston, on the border of the Nobel Plant, sits the South African Pavilion. Known locally as Africa House, this building was once part of the Empire Exhibition, Scotland 1938 in Bellahouston Park, Glasgow. The pavilion was rebuilt at Ardeer {{after the end of the}} exhibition and served as the staff restaurant for many years. The building now lays derelict and in disrepair, having suffered vandalism and extensive fire damage.|$|E

5000|$|Breivik {{prepared}} a document titled 2083: A European Declaration of Independence. It has 1,518 pages, credited to [...] "Andrew Berwick". Breivik admitted {{in court that}} it was mostly other people's writings he had copy pasted from different websites.The file was e-mailed to 1,003 addresses about 90 minutes before the bomb blast in Oslo. The document describes two years of preparation of unspecified attacks, supposedly planned for late 2011, involving a rented Volkswagen Crafter van (small enough not to require a truck driving licence) loaded with 1160 kg of ammonium nitrate/fuel oil explosive (ANFO), a Ruger Mini-14 semi-automatic rifle, a Glock 34 pistol, personal armour including a shield, caltrops, and police insignias. It also reports that Breivik spent thousands of hours gathering email addresses from Facebook for distribution of the document, and that he rented a farm as a cover for a fake farming company buying fertilizer (3 tons for <b>producing</b> <b>explosives</b> and 3 tons of a harmless kind to avoid suspicion) and as a lab. It describes burying a crate with the armour in the woods in July 2010, collecting it on 4 July 2011, and abandoning his plan {{to replace it with}} survival gear because {{he did not have a}} second pistol. It also expresses support for far-right groups such as the English Defence League and paramilitaries such as the Scorpions.|$|E
5000|$|After 1945 free {{elections}} were held, {{in which many}} parties (among them the Smallholders, the Social Democrats, and the Communists) were voted into Parliament. Due to Soviet pressure the government coalition, led by the Social Democrats, accepted the small Communist Party into the coalition. By the next election, most of the former government MEPs were entered into the Communist Party. In the election of 1949, the party, with Soviet backup resources, used the flaw in the so-called 'blue-ticket' election system, from which this election got its name, to have its voters transported in trucks to all voting offices, where with reproduced and collected blue tickets they could vote away from their home address district.The Communists gained power while the Soviet Army propped up the Hungarian state. Under their auspices, the former Arrow Cross torture chambers in the prisons filled up with their opponents. Arrests, beatings or summary executions were used as a standard tool by the Secret Police, who employed an extensive net of informants. Random arrests without charge were commonly initiated by regime informants, some of these abductees were never heard from again. By this time the administration was composed predominantly of hardline communists or careerists, who made up the Soviet-accepted controllers of wealth and power. Materials were routinely confiscated from the Hungarian populace and taken to the USSR for [...] "War Repairs". These administrators' actions were rewarded with position and favour. In Budapest this administrative approach was paired with aggressive industrialisation, militarisation, collectivisation and politicisation of the economy. Factories, chimneys, bridges, and railways were rapidly constructed. Workers during rest time were often subjected to Soviet propaganda and had to practice self-criticism in public meetings, negatively appraising their own performance. Rákosi's government {{was one of the}} most dictatorial and most exploitative of the Warsaw Pact countries.The political situation was centred on advancing the interest of those informal factions, which had their primary focus on well-being. In this situation, Imre Nagy was elected as next Prime Minister. He had gained widespread popularity by distributing land to farmers, and the support of the elite by practicing self-criticism and completing party programs, even when it conflicted with his proposals. He moved to create a multiparty system, winning the support of the MEP majority. He declared Hungarian sovereignty and self-governance, its departure from the Warsaw Pact and its willingness to co-operate with all countries. During this time, the CIA-sponsored Radio Free Europe broadcast effective methods of urban combat, including constructing barricades and <b>producing</b> <b>explosives.</b> In Budapest, peaceful protests demanding Soviet withdrawal, free press, freedom of expression and {{free elections}}, were organized by university students, professors and intellectuals. The Soviet Minister for War Issues ordered the brigades to move into the city. In response to this action, the protesters set up defenses. When the tanks and elite forces opened fire on the mass protest situated in front of the Parliament buildings, they caused a national uprising overnight. There were examples of long-stationed Soviet soldiers refusing to accept the authority of their officers and defecting to the revolutionary forces.|$|E
