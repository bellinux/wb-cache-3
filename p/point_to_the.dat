5|$|Although the station's {{capacity}} is {{small compared to}} other London terminals, it has a high footfall, averaging around 16 million passengers annually. A report in 2001 showed approximately 3,000 people commuted daily from Castle <b>Point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city via Fenchurch Street, while a 2013 report {{said it was the}} busiest station on the LTSR route, with 46,000 daily peak-time passengers.|$|E

5|$|The {{flags and}} pennants <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> low pressure, so it is {{possible}} to determine at which hemisphere the station is standing. The barbs in the figure at the right are located at the Northern Hemisphere, because the wind is circling counter clock-wise around a low-pressure area at the Northern Hemisphere (the wind is blowing in the opposite direction at the Southern Hemisphere, see also Buys Ballot's law).|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Peh-oe-ji has been heavily {{influenced}} by official attitudes towards the Southern Min vernaculars and the Christian organizations that propagated it.

5|$|The {{reason for}} this {{grouping}} is unclear; they certainly cannot be attributed to an attempt to match {{the lay of the}} river bed.

5|$|A {{possible}} {{issue with}} the causeway's identification as a Roman structure {{in the latter half}} of the twentieth century was its incorporation of many small bends along its course. Roman military roads are usually straight in both their overall course, and also typically from one vantage <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next. Both the Foss Way and the Stanegate, roads of established Roman provenance, have sinuous courses similar to Wade's causeway, so the objection is not conclusive.|$|E
5|$|Arlington was {{established}} in the 1880s by settlers and the area was platted as two towns, Arlington and Haller City. Haller City was absorbed by the larger Arlington, which was incorporated as a city in 1903. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Arlington area became home to projects under the direction of federal relief agencies, including a municipal airport that would serve as a naval air station during World War II. Beginning in the 1980s, Arlington experienced the effects of suburbanization, growing by over 450 percent by 2000 and annexing the unincorporated area of Smokey <b>Point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southwest.|$|E

During this year, she also saw a refit in Norfolk Navy Yard where five 5-inch guns were removed and three additional 3-inch/50 caliber AA guns were added, bringing the total to five. The secondary battery was reduced to sixteen 5-inch/51 caliber guns. In late 1919, she sailed to the Pacific Ocean and joined the newly formed United States Pacific Fleet. She continued to conduct training and patrol duties in the Pacific until the mid-1930s when she was transferred again to the Atlantic, and began operating out of the North Atlantic, with the exception of several occasional trips to the West Coast of the United States.|$|E
5|$|At the {{concluding}} Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced {{his and his}} descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca. Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean. Spain also ceded {{the rights to the}} lucrative asiento (permission to sell slaves in Spanish America) to Britain.|$|E
5|$|At the {{designated}} time of 05:25, the British opened {{up with an}} artillery barrage on the German positions just as the Australian forces entered no man's land for the attack. Heavy machine gun fire assaulted the troops from all directions as they bunched together on the firmer ground to avoid sinking in the boggy mud. Serious resistance was encountered at Hilside Farm, a strong <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of Augustus Wood in {{the centre of the}} highest part of the Passchendaele ridge. The position consisted of two pillboxes, supported by fifty metres of trench that was occupied by approximately thirty men with four machine guns. The fire from these machine guns forced the men of the 34th Battalion to seek cover on the exposed crest and threatened to halt the entire advance.|$|E
