6000|$|Your Committee finds but one instance, in {{the whole}} course of Parliamentary impeachments, in which {{evidence}} offered by the Commons has been rejected on the <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility</b> or incompetence. This was {{in the case of}} Lord Strafford's trial; when the copy of a warrant (the same not having any attestation to authenticate it as a true copy) was, on deliberation, not admitted,--and your Committee thinks, as the case stood, with reason. But even in this one instance the Lords seemed to show a marked anxiety not to narrow too much the admissibility of evidence; for they confined their determination [...] "to this individual case," [...] as the Lord Steward reported their resolution; and he adds,--"They conceive this could be no impediment or failure in the proceeding, because the truth and verity of it would depend on the first general power given to execute it, which they who manage the evidence for the Commons say they could prove."[36] Neither have objections to evidence offered by the prisoner been very frequently made, nor often allowed when made. In the same case of Lord Strafford, two books produced by his Lordship, without proof by whom they were written, were rejected, (and on a clear principle,) [...] "as being private books, and no records."[37] On both these occasions, the questions were determined by the Lords alone, without any resort to the opinions of the Judges. In the impeachments of Lord Stafford, Dr. Sacheverell, and Lord Wintoun, no objection to evidence appears in the Lords' Journals to have been pressed, and not above one taken, which was {{on the part of the}} Managers.|$|E
40|$|The General Court (Fourth Chamber, Extended Composition) annulled Commission Decision 2010 / 169 /EU of 19 March 2010 {{concerning}} the non-inclusion of 2, 4, 4 ’-trichloro- 2 ’-hydroxydiphenyl ether in the Union list of additives {{which may be}} used in the manufacture of plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs under Directive 2002 / 72 /EC. The General Court concluded that the Commission infringed Regulation No 1935 / 2004 and Directive 2002 / 72 in adopting a decision not to include an additive {{solely on the basis of}} the withdrawal of the initial application for inclusion of triclosan in the positive list, in circumstances where there was no legal basis allowing the adoption of such a decision; and also declared that it could not be held that the contested decision entailed implementing measures: therefore declared that that decision constituted a regulatory act of direct concern to the applicants, which did not entail any implementing measures, so that the <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility</b> raised by the Commission had to be dismissed without it being necessary to consider whether it was of individual concern to the applicants...|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{agreed that the}} European Court of Human Rights is in crisis; a "victim of its own success", with an {{ever-increasing}} caseload and a backlog of over 18, 000 applications pending. This article critically examines various proposals for alleviating the problem, as submitted by the Working Party on Working Methods of the European Court of Human Rights. The author argues that while it is clearly necessary {{to ensure that the}} Court functions as efficiently as possible, this should not be achieved at the expense of undermining the right of individual petition. In particular it is contended that eliminating "warning letters", transferring most decisions <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility</b> to three-judge committees, expanding the grounds <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility,</b> dispensing with giving reasons for declarations <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility,</b> avoiding fact-finding missions and pushing for friendly-settlements are all measures that undermine the very principle of democratic justice which {{lies at the heart of}} the Court's existence...|$|R

5000|$|Mr. Figueroa's {{case has}} set some {{important}} legal precedents {{that relates to}} the legal definition of different terms, such as: the legal definition of [...] "membership", [...] "organization", [...] "terrorism", and how those legal terms are used to advance on findings <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility</b> under Section 34(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) against immigrants and refugees who {{at any point in}} life were part of or sympathizers of movements that fought in struggles for liberation. The finding <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility</b> by the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board(IRB)against Mr. Figueroa on May 5, 2010, when compared with the fact that if the allegation had been brought against a prominent figure such a Nelson Mandela, highlights an evident paradox in the law. Mr. Mandela would have been found inadmissible into Canada due to his membership with the African National Congress (ANC), however, Nelson Mandela was an honorary citizen of Canada.|$|R

2500|$|A 1999 policy {{letter from}} {{immigration}} officials defined [...] "public charge" [...] and identified which benefits are considered in public charge determinations, {{and the policy}} letter underlies current regulations and other guidance on the public charge grounds <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility</b> and deportability. Collectively, the various sources addressing the meaning of public charge have historically suggested that an alien's receipt of public benefits, per se, is unlikely to result in the alien being deemed to be removable on public charge grounds.|$|R
40|$|Shrinkage {{estimation}} {{has become}} a basic tool {{in the analysis of}} high-dimensional data. Historically and conceptually a key development toward this was the discovery <b>of</b> the <b>inadmissibility</b> <b>of</b> the usual estimator of a multivariate normal mean. This article develops a geometrical explanation for this inadmissibility. By exploiting the spherical symmetry of the problem it is possible to effectively conceptualize the multidimensional setting in a two-dimensional framework that can be easily plotted and geometrically analyzed. We begin with the heuristic explanation for inadmissibility that was given by Stein [In Proceedings of the Third Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability, 1954 – 1955, Vol. I (1956) 197 – 206, Univ. California Press]. Some geometric figures are included to make this reasoning more tangible. It is also explained why Stein’s argument falls short of yielding a proof <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility,</b> even when the dimension, p, is much larger than p = 3. We then extend the geometric idea to yield increasingly persuasive arguments for inadmissibility when p ≥ 3, albeit at the cost of increased geometric and computational detail...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> [...] "autrefois convict" [...] (Law French for [...] "previously convicted") is one {{in which}} the {{defendant}} claims to have been previously convicted of the same offence and that he or she therefore cannot be tried for it again. In the instance where a defendant has been summonsed to both criminal and civil proceedings, a <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> autrefois convict is essentially an application to 'merge' proceedings, giving rise to res judicata or a cause of action estoppel in civil proceedings. This means that the secondary proceedings should not go ahead and the complaint stopped. A <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> autrefois convict can be combined with a <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> not guilty.|$|R
