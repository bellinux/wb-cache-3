5|$|Norton Internet Security 2000, {{released}} January 10, 2000, was Symantec's {{first foray}} beyond virus protection and content control filters. Its release followed an alliance between Internet provider Excite@Home and antivirus vendor McAfee.com to provide Internet subscribers with McAfee's new firewall software, McAfee <b>Personal</b> <b>Firewall.</b> Version 2000s firewall, based on AtGuard from WRQ, filters traffic at the packet level. It can block ActiveX controls and Java applets. Other functionalities include cookie removal, and banner ad blocking. ZDNet found the ad blocker removed graphics {{that were not}} ads, breaking pages. Adjusting the settings fixed the problem, however the process was complicated. ZDNet noted {{the lack of information}} presented concerning attacks the firewall blocked. Norton LiveUpdate downloads and installs program updates.|$|E
5|$|On 18 November 2008, Microsoft {{announced}} plans for a free consumer security product, codenamed Morro. This development marked a change in Microsoft's consumer AV marketing strategy: instead of offering a subscription-based security product {{with a host of}} other tools, such as backup and a <b>personal</b> <b>firewall,</b> Morro would offer free AV protection with a smaller impact on system resources. Amy Barzdukas, senior director of product management for the Online Services and Windows Division at Microsoft, announced that Morro would not directly compete with other commercial AV software; rather it was focused on the 50 to 60 percent of PC users who did not have or would not pay for AV protection. By 17 June 2009, the official name of Morro was revealed: Microsoft Security Essentials.|$|E
5|$|In October 2009, AV-TEST {{conducted}} {{a series of}} trials on the final build of the product in which it detected and caught 98.44 percent of 545,034 computer viruses, computer worms and software Trojan horses as well as 90.95 percent of 14,222 spyware and adware samples. It also detected and eliminated all 25 tested rootkits, generating no false-positives. Between June 2010 to January 2013, AV-TEST tested Microsoft Security Essentials 14 times; in 11 out of 14 cases, MSE secured AV-TEST certification of outperforming AV industry average ratings. Microsoft Security Essentials 2.0 was tested and certified on March 2011. The product achieved a protection score of 2.5 out of 6, a repair score of 3.5 out of 6 and a usability score of 5.5 out of 6. Report details show that although version 2.0 was able to find all malware samples of the WildList (widespread malware), it was not able to stop all Internet-based attacks because it lacks <b>personal</b> <b>firewall</b> and anti-spam capabilities. In an April 2012 test, version 2.1 achieved scores of 3.0, 5.5 and 5.0 for protection, repair and usability. Version 4.0 for Windows 7 SP1 (x64) was tested in June 2012 and achieved scores of 2.5, 5.5 and 5.5 for protection, repair and usability. In October 2012, the product lost its AV-TEST certification when Microsoft Security Essentials 4.1 achieved scores of 1.5, 3.5 and 5.5 for its protection, repair and usability.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—By {{accurately}} measuring {{risk for}} enterprise networks, attack graphs allow network defenders {{to understand the}} most critical threats and select the most effective countermeasures. This paper describes substantial enhancements to the NetSPA attack graph system required to model additional present-day threats (zero-day exploits and client-side attacks) and countermeasures (intrusion prevention systems, proxy <b>firewalls,</b> <b>personal</b> <b>firewalls,</b> and host-based vulnerability scans). Point-to-point reachability algorithms and structures were extensively redesigned to support “reverse ” reachability computations and <b>personal</b> <b>firewalls.</b> Host-based vulnerability scans are imported and analyzed. Analysis of an operational network with 85 hosts demonstrates that client-side attacks pose a serious threat.

Third-party anti-virus, anti-spyware and <b>personal</b> <b>firewall</b> software vendors primarily register with Security and Maintenance through the WMI provider.

These APIs allow programs to confirm that the system is in a healthy state before engaging in certain actions. For example, a computer game can ensure that a firewall is running before connecting to an online game.|$|E
25|$|In August, 1996, FSA was {{acquired}} by antivirus maker McAfee Associates, which wanted to expand its products from antivirus into the more general security area. The FSA team developed 12 new product lines for McAfee in the following 12 months, including NetCrypto, PCCrypto, WebScan, McAfee <b>Personal</b> <b>Firewall,</b> {{and a number of}} other products only some of which were successful. With little interest in UNIX software at that time, McAfee sold the PowerBroker product line to Symark Software (now known as BeyondTrust) in a non-exclusive deal. Ironically, McAfee also sold rights to PowerBroker to Raxco, which was later acquired by arch-rival Symantec. McAfee continued its security expansion with the acquisition of Trusted Information Systems and PGP.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{security}} architectures tend {{to become}} more and more complex. Not only the chances to improve Web applications using several data channels and diverse (TCP-) ports are very promising, but also the risks for criminal attacks and an intrusion into the corporate network are increasing. The classical solution to protect networks against criminal attacks with firewalls is problematic, though. On the one hand, attacks from the inside are hardly prevented by firewalls, on the other, mobile computing poses additional security risks to the corporate networks. <b>Personal</b> <b>firewalls</b> solve some of those problems, but their central administration is very difficult.
