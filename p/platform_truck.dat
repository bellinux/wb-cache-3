60|$|The bedlam {{increased}} as {{the animals were}} transferred from the wagon to a <b>platform</b> <b>truck,</b> and when the truck rolled up and stopped alongside Michael's he made {{out that it was}} piled high with crated dogs. In truth, there were thirty-five dogs, of every sort of breed and mostly mongrel, and that they were far from happy was attested by their actions. Some howled, some whimpered, others growled and raged at one another through the slots, and many maintained a silence of misery. Several licked and nursed bruised feet. Smaller dogs that did not fight much were crammed two or more into single crates. Half a dozen greyhounds were crammed into larger crates that were anything save large enough.|$|E

5000|$|Baker, Rauch & Lang's Industrial Truck Division {{introduced}} {{a number of}} new products in the early twenties including a ram truck for carrying heavy steel coils as well as a line of low-lift <b>platform</b> <b>truck</b> and cranes. The Hy-Lift <b>platform</b> <b>truck</b> was introduced in 1922, and an articulated sheet handler in 1923. This innovative electric unit had a pivoted platform that could load 10-foot steel sheets through a standard seven-foot railroad car door. They also developed a duplex or [...] "knee-action" [...] compensating suspension that pre-dated GM's duBonnet system by a number of years.|$|E
50|$|Electric {{platform}} {{trucks are}} electric powered trucks {{with a large}} flat surface for holding objects to be transported. Some are also called warehouse utility vehicles, electric trolley carts, or powered <b>platform</b> <b>truck</b> vehicles.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} and into {{the first half of}} 2013, apparatus availability was at a low point. An estimated 40 units remained in service, with all three aerial <b>platform</b> <b>trucks</b> damaged or defective, and up to eight engine and seven ladder companies browned out. At the end of January 2013, the entire fleet of aerial ladder trucks was found lacking certification for routine operations.|$|R
50|$|By the 20th century, {{electric}} cars and rail transport were commonplace, with commercial electric automobiles having {{the majority of}} the market. Over time their general-purpose commercial use reduced to specialist roles, as <b>platform</b> <b>trucks,</b> forklift trucks, ambulances, tow tractors and urban delivery vehicles, such as the iconic British milk float; for most of the 20th century, the UK was the world's largest user of electric road vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The Transport Museum, Wythall has a {{collection}} of battery-electric road vehicles which includes two Electricars and six Morrison-Electricars.There is an Electricars model CY2, dating from 1935, with a streamlined van body, originally used as a demonstrator, but then sold to Fowlers Forest Dairies, and a 1946 model TU20 <b>platform</b> <b>truck,</b> supplied to Metro Cammell. The Morrison-Electricar collection comprises a 1953 mdoel D1 20 cwt bakery van, a 1954 model D1 30 cwt van, which was rebodied in the 1980s, and a 1954 D1 30 cwt milk float, {{all of which were}} operated by Bimingham Co-operative Society. A 1955 model MD20 20 cwt milk float, rebodied in the 1960s, which came from Midland Counties Dairy, a model D1 30 cwt dating from 1956, which was owned by the Ten Acres and Stirchley Co-op, and a model D5 15 cwt milk float dating from 1964 and run by Ivy Farm Dairy, complete the line-up.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the basic cargo version, tank water and fuel. The CEMABLIN-(Centro de Mantenimiento de Blindados del Ejército Venezolano) locally manufactured a version of anti-air defense operations and support, thanks to all the necessary parts were stored and in perfect condition. 6 units were produced in early 1998. The [...] "Fénix" [...] system {{was assigned to the}} 1103º BDAA 40mm. based at Fort Yaurepara in Zulia state. But they had problems with the tower's weight and shoot on the move. They were retired in 1998 and substituted by the AMX-13 M55/M4E1 [...] "Ráfaga" [...] 40mm also produced locally stored material advantage and in good condition.The [...] "Fénix" [...] is a M4E1 tower, recovered from a car M42 Duster and 2 M50 machine guns [...]30 caliber for Protective Part (a cylindrical tower made of welded armor plate with open top with twin mounting Bofors 40 mm gun), mounted on a tactical <b>platform</b> <b>Truck</b> 6x6 2½-ton Reo M-35.|$|E
5000|$|Commercial Motor {{carried a}} review of the Graiseley PCV in 1940, which stated that this model had been in service with {{commercial}} operators, including bakeries and dairies, for two years. It came with a [...] motor, and was designed to travel at 3 mph, with a range of 8 to 10 mi on normal door-to-door delivery work. It could be supplied as a flat <b>platform</b> <b>truck,</b> with an open body suitable for milk delivery, or as a closed van, suitable for delivering bread. The motor, gearbox and an automatic clutch were mounted on the single front wheel forks. A chain formed part of the final drive. The control system included a contactor manufactured by British Thompson-Houston, and the centrifugal drum clutch was designed to engage when the motor reached 250 revs per minute, providing a smooth start without the need for starting resistors. The three-wheeled PCV was produced in three sizes, the Model 60, with a payload of 8-10 cwt, the Model 75, with a 12-15 cwt payload, and the Model 90, which could carry 22 cwt. Because the primary focus was on the dairy industry, the model numbers represented the number of imperial gallons of milk that could be carried.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} <b>platform</b> <b>trucks</b> {{that do not}} have a ladder {{attached}} to the platform. These specialized elevated work platforms are capable of articulating which allows the arm to bend in one or more places. This is an advantage over the traditional platform ladder, which can only extend in a straight line and gives the articulating platform the ability to go [...] "up and over" [...] an obstacle (see picture).|$|R
50|$|The Chrysler AD <b>{{platform}}</b> was a <b>truck</b> <b>platform</b> {{used from}} 1972 through 1993. It was mainly used for pickup trucks like the Dodge D Series, thus the name. The AD platform {{was replaced by}} the Chrysler BE platform in 1994.|$|R
50|$|The Chevrolet Silverado, and its {{mechanically}} identical cousin, the GMC Sierra, are {{a series}} of full-size and heavy-duty pickup trucks manufactured by General Motors and introduced in 1998 as the successor to the long-running Chevrolet C/K line. The Silverado name was taken from a trim level previously used on its predecessor, the Chevrolet C/K pickup truck from 1975 through 1998. General Motors continues to offer a GMC-badged variant of the Chevrolet full-size pickup under the GMC Sierra name, first used in 1987 for its variant of the GMT400 <b>platform</b> <b>trucks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The news of Szarek's {{murder was}} {{released}} by the Vatican and publicized around the world, from The New York Times [...] which on 25 January 1940 carried the article of Herbert Matthews in Rome entitled [...] "Vatican Continues Atrocity Charges: Report on Poland Gives Names of Priests who Have Been Murdered", which article was sourced to [...] "authorized Vatican circles close to the Secretariat of State" [...] to a provincial monthly The DeAndrein of Perryville, Missouri, which in its March 1940 edition carried the article [...] "Hell on Earth" [...] on the first page. On 30 January 1940 The New York Times published the entire text of Cardinal Hlond's original report to the Pope on Nazi persecutions in Poland, which discusses Szarek's case. However, {{in a series of}} reports issued in 1942 by the United Nations information office in London (the so-called United Nations Information Organisation, formerly the Inter-Allied Information Committee), Szarek was reported to have been buried while still alive. (Indeed, according to a deposition given after the War by the Sikorski family who performed the functions of caretakers of the Bydgoszcz cemetery while secretly recording all deaths due to Nazi repressions, among the bodies of the victims of the 9 September 1939 massacre dumped at the cemetery by the Nazis off a <b>platform</b> <b>truck,</b> two showed signs of life.) ...|$|E
