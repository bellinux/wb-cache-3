50|$|These four islands lie to {{the east}} of McArthur Island, in The Archipelago, in Theriault Bay and outside of Interior Bay. They are all roughly the size of an outdoor {{backyard}} swimming <b>pool.</b> <b>Anchor</b> and Blackfly Islands consist of a few trees and slippery rocks on the shore. Forest Island is home to a myriad of densely packed trees and an eroded shore making accessibility impossible. Shoal Island appears for the summer-autumn part of the year, as the water is low. For the rest of the year, the high water levels cover the 20 cm high island composed only of large stones.|$|E

40|$|The {{regional}} {{literature suggests}} that locallabor markets offer significant operating advantages to firms in knowledge-intensive industries and thus influence the development of contemporary industrial location patterns. Utilizing two data sets containing information on the employment changes of US semiconductor engineers during the critical formative period (1950 - 75), the author tests the <b>pooling</b> and <b>anchoring</b> hypotheses of urban economic theory while extending the theory to incorporate the effects of labor and firm specialization. Findings include: (1) moderate evidence of locality-centered labor pooling in this occupation during this early time period; (2) no evidence of anchoring by nonmarket actors, such as universities and government laboratories or by early labor markets; and (3) evidence that agglomerations of firms develop {{as a result of}} imperfect skill - opportunity matches. The results discount frequently offered explanations for the emergence of industrial agglomerations and suggest that agglomerations are not the outcome of firms' searches for operating efficiencies but may be a product of entrepreneurship induced by particular 'permanently failing' firms. ...|$|R
40|$|CAMP concentra-tions {{returned}} to basal levels. Conclusions The type II PKA is dispersed at specific sites throughout the cell be-cause of {{interaction of the}} regulatory subunit of PKA with anchoring pro-teins. We believe that PKA anchor-ing is important in controlling which substrate proteins become phos-phorylated by individual kinase pools, Colocalization of the kinase with its physiological substrates is important as it ensures their rapid phosphorylation in response to ele-vated CAMP. To tightly control which <b>pools</b> of <b>anchored</b> kinase be-come active, compartmentalized changes in CAMP must occur, The recent studies of Barsony and Marx (1) agree with this hypothesis and {{support the notion that}} hormone action promotes accumulation of CAMP in different cellular compart-ments. Therefore, it is conceivable that individual hormones will acti-vate different pools of kinase local-ized in particular cellular compart-ments, thereby triggering phos-phorylation of specific substrate proteins. Changes in the activity of the newly phosphorylated proteins will potentiate the hormonal re-sponse by altering the physiology of the cell.

40|$|A-kinase {{anchoring}} proteins (AKAPs) coordinate {{cell signaling}} events. AKAP 79 brings together {{different combinations of}} enzyme binding partners to customize the regulation of effector proteins. In neurons, muscarinic agonists mobilize an AKAP 79 <b>anchored</b> <b>pool</b> of PKC that phosphorylates the KCNQ 2 subunit of the M channel. This inhibits potassium permeability to enhance neuronal excitability. Using a dual fluorescent imaging/patch-clamp technique, we visualized AKAP 79 -anchored PKC phosphorylation of the kinase activity reporter CKAR concurrently with electrophysiological changes in KCNQ 2 channels to show that AKAP 79 synchronizes both signaling events to optimize the attenuation of M currents. AKAP 79 also protects PKC from certain ATP-competitive inhibitors. Related studies suggest that context-dependent protein-protein interactions alter the susceptibility of another protein kinase, PDK 1, to ATP analog inhibitors. This implies that intracellular binding partners not only couple individual molecular events in a cell signaling process but can also change the pharmacological profile of certain protein kinases...|$|R
40|$|Glutamate is {{the primary}} {{excitatory}} neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, regulating numerous cellular signaling pathways and controlling the excitability of central synapses both pre- and postsynaptically. Localization, cell surface expression, and activity-dependent regulation of glutamate receptors in both neurons and glia are performed and maintained by a complex network of protein–protein interactions associated with targeting, anchoring, and spatially organizing synaptic proteins at the cell membrane. Using in situ hybridization, we examined the expression of transcripts encoding the AMPA receptor subunits (GluR 1 –GluR 4) and a family of AMPA-related intracellular proteins. We focused on PDZ-proteins {{that are involved in}} the regulated <b>pool</b> and <b>anchoring</b> AMPA subunits to the cell membrane (PICK 1, syntenin), and those maintaining the constitutive pool of AMPA receptors at the glutamatergic synapse (NSF, stargazin). In addition, we studied a fifth protein, KIAA 1719, with high homology to the rat PDZ protein ABP, associated with the clustering of AMPA receptors at the glutamate synapse. The AMPA subunits showed significant differences in regional expression, especially in the neocortex, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum. The expression of other proteins, even those related to a specific AMPA subunit (such as ABP and PICK 1 to GluR 2 and GluR 3), often had different distributions, whereas others (like NSF) are ubiquitously distributed in the brain. These results suggest that AMPA subunits and related intracellular proteins are differentially distributed in the macaque brain, and in numerous structures there are significant mismatches, suggesting additional functional properties of the associated intracellular proteins.

40|$|Efficient and {{specific}} phosphorylation of PKA substrates, elicited {{in response to}} β-adrenergic stimulation, require spatially confined <b>pools</b> of PKA <b>anchored</b> in proximity of its substrates. PKA-dependent phosphorylation of cardiac sarcomeric proteins {{has been the subject}} of intense investigations. Yet, the identity, composition, and function of PKA complexes at the sarcomeres have remained elusive. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel sarcomeric AKAP (A-kinase anchoring protein), cardiac troponin T (cTnT). Using yeast two-hybrid technology in screening two adult human heart cDNA libraries, we identified the regulatory subunit of PKA as interacting with human cTnT bait. Immunoprecipitation studies show that cTnT is a dual specificity AKAP, interacting with both PKA-regulatory subunits type I and II. The disruptor peptide Ht 31, but not Ht 31 P (control), abolished cTnT/PKA-R association. Truncations and point mutations identified an amphipathic helix domain in cTnT as the PKA binding site. This was confirmed by a peptide SPOT assay in the presence of Ht 31 or Ht 31 P (control). Gelsolin-dependent removal of thin filament proteins also reduced myofilament-bound PKA-type II. Using a cTn exchange procedure that substitutes the endogenous cTn complex with a recombinant cTn complex we show that PKA-type II is troponin-bound in the myofilament lattice. Displacement of PKA-cTnT complexes correlates with a significant decrease in myofibrillar PKA activity. Taken together, our data propose a novel role for cTnT as a dual-specificity sarcomeric AKAP...|$|R
40|$|Our {{goal is to}} {{construct}} a robust physical map for maize (Zea mays) comprehensively integrated with the genetic map. We have used a two-dimensional 24 × 24 overgo <b>pooling</b> strategy to <b>anchor</b> maize expressed sequence tagged (EST) unigenes to 165, 888 bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) on high-density filters. A set of 70, 716 public maize ESTs seeded derivation of 10, 723 EST unigene assemblies. From these assemblies, 10, 642 overgo sequences of 40 bp were applied as hybridization probes. BAC addresses were obtained for 9, 371 overgo probes, representing an 88 % success rate. More than 96 % of the successful overgo probes identified two or more BACs, while 5 % identified more than 50 BACs. The majority of BACs identified (79 %) were hybridized {{with one or two}} overgos. A small number of BACs hybridized with eight or more overgos, suggesting that these BACs must be gene rich. Approximately 5, 670 overgos identified BACs assembled within one contig, indicating that these probes are highly locus specific. A total of 1, 795 megabases (Mb; 87 %) of the total 2, 050 Mb in BAC contigs were associated with one or more overgos, which are serving as sequence-tagged sites for single nucleotide polymorphism development. Overgo density ranged from less than one overgo per megabase to greater than 20 overgos per megabase. The majority of contigs (52 %) hit by overgos contained three to nine overgos per megabase. Analysis of approximately 1, 022 Mb of genetically anchored BAC contigs indicates that 9, 003 of the total 13, 900 overgo-contig sites are genetically anchored. Our results indicate overgos are a powerful approach for generating gene-specific hybridization probes that are facilitating the assembly of an integrated genetic and physical map for maize...|$|R
