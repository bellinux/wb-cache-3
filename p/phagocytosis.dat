5|$|In {{addition}} to protein- and solution-mediated processes, {{it is also}} possible for lipid bilayers to participate directly in signaling. A classic example of this is phosphatidylserine-triggered <b>phagocytosis.</b> Normally, phosphatidylserine is asymmetrically distributed in the cell membrane and is present only on the interior side. During programmed cell death a protein called a scramblase equilibrates this distribution, displaying phosphatidylserine on the extracellular bilayer face. The presence of phosphatidylserine then triggers <b>phagocytosis</b> to remove the dead or dying cell.|$|E
5|$|<b>Phagocytosis</b> is an {{important}} feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that engulf, or eat, pathogens or particles. Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. <b>Phagocytosis</b> evolved {{as a means of}} acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism. <b>Phagocytosis</b> probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.|$|E
5|$|In animals, vacuoles {{serve in}} {{exocytosis}} and endocytosis processes. Endocytosis refers to when substances {{are taken into}} the cell, whereas for exocytosis substances are moved from the cell into the extracellular space. Material to be taken-in is surrounded by the plasma membrane, and then transferred to a vacuole. There {{are two types of}} endocytosis, <b>phagocytosis</b> (cell eating) and pinocytosis (cell drinking). In <b>phagocytosis,</b> cells engulf large particles such as bacteria. Pinocytosis is the same process, except the substances being ingested are in the fluid form.|$|E
5|$|Non-{{professional}} phagocytes {{are more}} limited than professional phagocytes {{in the type}} of particles they can take up. This is due to their lack of efficient phagocytic receptors, in particular opsonins—which are antibodies and complement attached to invaders by the immune system. Additionally, most nonprofessional phagocytes do not produce reactive oxygen-containing molecules in response to <b>phagocytosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|A year later, Mechnikov {{studied a}} fresh water {{crustacean}} called Daphnia, a tiny transparent animal {{that can be}} examined directly under a microscope. He discovered that fungal spores that attacked the animal were destroyed by phagocytes. He went on to extend his observations to the white blood cells of mammals and discovered that the bacterium Bacillus anthracis could be engulfed and killed by phagocytes, a process that he called <b>phagocytosis.</b> Mechnikov proposed that phagocytes were a primary defense against invading organisms.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study has}} implicated EFS in the Chediak-Higashi {{syndrome}} (CHS). This rare and severe autosomal recessive disorder associated with partial albinism, peripheral neuropathy, mild coagulation defects and propensity to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, caused by incomplete <b>phagocytosis</b> due to failure in phagolysosome formation. This work identified a direct interaction in vitro and in vivo between EFS and LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator, aka CHS1 - Chediak-Higashi syndrome 1), a large protein that regulates the intracellular trafficking of proteins through endosomes that is mutated in CHS. These results may imply {{the role of}} EFS as a disease progression modifier, although further testing and establishment of mechanism is necessary.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is used {{in cases}} of {{suspected}} toxic shock syndrome, often in combination with a bactericidal agent such as vancomycin. The rationale for this approach is a presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes {{the death of the}} bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and clindamycin, which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the surface structure of bacteria that make them more sensitive to immune system attack (opsonization and <b>phagocytosis).</b>|$|E
5|$|Invertebrates {{constitute}} {{a vast array}} of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular eukaryotes such as Paramecium to such complex multicellular animals as the octopus, lobster and dragonfly. They {{constitute a}}bout 95% of the animal species. By definition, none of these creatures has a backbone. The cells of single-cell protozoans have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs. Locomotion is often provided by cilia or flagella or may proceed via the advance of pseudopodia, food may be gathered by <b>phagocytosis,</b> energy needs may be supplied by photosynthesis and the cell may be supported by an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton. Some protozoans can form multicellular colonies.|$|E
5|$|Lysosomes {{carry out}} {{intracellular}} digestion, {{in a process}} called <b>phagocytosis</b> (from the Greek phagein, to eat and kytos, vessel, referring here to the cell), by fusing with a vacuole and releasing their enzymes into the vacuole. Through this process, sugars, amino acids, and other monomers pass into the cytosol and become nutrients for the cell. Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cell's obsolete organelles in a process called autophagy. The lysosome engulfs another organelle and uses its enzymes to take apart the ingested material. The resulting organic monomers are {{then returned to the}} cytosol for reuse. The last function of a lysosome is to digest the cell itself through autolysis.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of drug delivery liposomes had a simple lipid composition and suffered from several limitations. Circulation in the bloodstream was extremely limited due to both renal clearing and <b>phagocytosis.</b> Refinement of the lipid composition to tune fluidity, surface charge density, and surface hydration resulted in vesicles that adsorb fewer proteins from serum and thus are less readily recognized by the immune system. The most significant advance in this area was the grafting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) onto the liposome surface to produce “stealth” vesicles, which circulate over long times without immune or renal clearing.|$|E
5|$|Two of its subunits, the Actin-Related Proteins ARP2 and ARP3 closely {{resemble}} {{the structure of}} monomeric actin and serve as nucleation sites for new actin filaments. The complex binds {{to the sides of}} existing ("mother") filaments and initiates growth of a new ("daughter") filament at a distinctive 70 degree angle from the mother. Branched actin networks are created {{as a result of this}} nucleation of new filaments. The regulation of rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton is important for processes like cell locomotion, <b>phagocytosis,</b> and intracellular motility of lipid vesicles.|$|E
5|$|Unlike true fungi, {{the cell}} walls of oomycetes contain {{cellulose}} and lack chitin. Hyphochytrids have both chitin and cellulose. Slime molds lack a cell wall during the assimilative phase (except labyrinthulids, {{which have a}} wall of scales), and ingest nutrients by ingestion (<b>phagocytosis,</b> except labyrinthulids) rather than absorption (osmotrophy, as fungi, labyrinthulids, oomycetes and hyphochytrids). Neither water molds nor slime molds {{are closely related to}} the true fungi, and, therefore, taxonomists no longer group them in the kingdom Fungi. Nonetheless, studies of the oomycetes and myxomycetes are still often included in mycology textbooks and primary research literature.|$|E
5|$|Compounds from T. felleus {{have been}} {{extracted}} and researched for potential medical uses. Tylopilan is a beta-glucan that was {{isolated from the}} fruit bodies in 1988 and shown in laboratory tests to have cytotoxic properties and to stimulate non-specific immunological response. In particular, it enhances <b>phagocytosis,</b> {{the process by which}} macrophages and granulocytes engulf and digest foreign bacteria. In experiments on mice with tumour cells, it appeared to have antitumour effects when administered in combination with a preparation of Propionibacterium acnes in a 1994 Polish study. Researchers in 2004 reported that extracts of the fruit body inhibit the enzyme pancreatic lipase; it was the second most inhibitory of 100 mushrooms they tested. A compound present in the mushroom, N-γ-glutamyl boletine, has mild antibacterial activity.|$|E
5|$|Most {{anthozoans}} are opportunistic predators, catching prey which drifts {{within reach}} of their tentacles. The prey is secured {{with the help of}} sticky mucus, spirocysts (non-venomous harpoon cells) and nematocysts (venomous harpoon cells). The tentacles then bend to push larger prey into the mouth, while smaller, plankton-size prey, is moved by cilia to the tip of the tentacles which are then inserted into the mouth. The mouth can stretch to accommodate large items, and in some species, the lips may extend to help receive the prey. The pharynx then grasps the prey, which is mixed with mucus and slowly swallowed by peristalsis and ciliary action. When the food reaches the coelenteron, extracellular digestion is initiated by the discharge of the septa-based nematocysts and the release of enzymes. The partially digested food fragments are circulated in the coelenteron by cilia, and from here they are taken up by <b>phagocytosis</b> by the gastrodermal cells that line the cavity.|$|E
5|$|Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, {{and thereby}} avoid {{detection}} and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved {{to recognize and}} neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system {{in the form of}} enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include <b>phagocytosis,</b> antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.|$|E
5|$|The {{diseases}} and parasites that affect octopuses have been little studied, but cephalopods {{are known to}} be the intermediate or final hosts of various parasitic cestodes, nematodes and copepods; 150 species of protistan and metazoan parasites have been recognised. The Dicyemidae are a family of tiny worms that are found in the renal appendages of many species; it is unclear whether they are parasitic or are endosymbionts. Coccidians in the genusAggregata living in the gut cause severe disease to the host. Octopuses have an innate immune system, and the haemocytes respond to infection by <b>phagocytosis,</b> encapsulation, infiltration or cytotoxic activities to destroy or isolate the pathogens. The haemocytes {{play an important role in}} the recognition and elimination of foreign bodies and wound repair. Captive animals have been found to be more susceptible to pathogens than wild ones. A gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio lentus, has been found to cause skin lesions, exposure of muscle and death of octopuses in extreme cases.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{reaction}} of infected cells {{is to produce}} interferon, a cytokine that raises a number of defenses against viral infection through the innate immune system by augmenting {{the production of a}} large group of proteins mediated by the JAK-STAT pathway. Some serotypes of dengue virus appear to have mechanisms to slow down this process. Interferon also activates the adaptive immune system, which leads to the generation of antibodies against the virus as well as T cells that directly attack any cell infected with the virus. Various antibodies are generated; some bind closely to the viral proteins and target them for <b>phagocytosis</b> (ingestion by specialized cells and destruction), but some bind the virus less well and appear instead to deliver the virus into a part of the phagocytes where it is not destroyed but is able to replicate further.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{evidence}} has emerged showing that lipid signaling {{is a vital}} part of the cell signaling. Lipid signaling may occur via activation of G protein-coupled or nuclear receptors, and members of several different lipid categories have been identified as signaling molecules and cellular messengers. These include sphingosine-1-phosphate, a sphingolipid derived from ceramide that is a potent messenger molecule involved in regulating calcium mobilization, cell growth, and apoptosis; diacylglycerol (DAG) and the phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), involved in calcium-mediated activation of protein kinase C; the prostaglandins, which are one type of fatty-acid derived eicosanoid involved in inflammation and immunity; the steroid hormones such as estrogen, testosterone and cortisol, which modulate a host of functions such as reproduction, metabolism and blood pressure; and the oxysterols such as 25-hydroxy-cholesterol that are liver X receptor agonists. Phosphatidylserine lipids are known to be involved in signaling for the <b>phagocytosis</b> of apoptotic cells or pieces of cells. They accomplish this by being exposed to the extracellular face of the cell membrane after the inactivation of flippases which place them exclusively on the cytosolic side and the activation of scramblases, which scramble the orientation of the phospholipids. After this occurs, other cells recognize the phosphatidylserines and phagocytosize the cells or cell fragments exposing them.|$|E
25|$|Leukocytes {{generate}} HCN during <b>phagocytosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|CRP binds to phosphocholine on micro-organisms. It {{is thought}} to assist in {{complement}} binding to foreign and damaged cells and enhances <b>phagocytosis</b> by macrophages (opsonin-mediated <b>phagocytosis),</b> which express a receptor for CRP. It {{plays a role in}} innate immunity as an early defense system against infections.|$|E
25|$|In <b>phagocytosis,</b> cells engulf solid particles.|$|E
25|$|Biologists {{distinguish}} {{two main}} types of endocytosis: pinocytosis and <b>phagocytosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Old {{platelets}} {{are destroyed}} by <b>phagocytosis</b> in the spleen and liver.|$|E
25|$|Uranium dioxide {{is known}} to be absorbed by <b>phagocytosis</b> in the lungs.|$|E
25|$|On macrophages CD36 forms {{part of a}} non-opsonic {{receptor}} (the scavenger receptor CD36/alphaV beta3 complex) and {{is involved}} in <b>phagocytosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|By contrast, a powerful, {{short-term}} {{stimulation of}} oxidative burst by human monocytes was also shown to occur during <b>phagocytosis</b> of nHZ.|$|E
25|$|S. aureus {{produces}} various enzymes such as coagulase (bound {{and free}} coagulases) which clots plasma and coats the bacterial cell, probably to prevent <b>phagocytosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Leukocytes {{generate}} HCN during <b>phagocytosis,</b> and {{can kill}} bacteria, fungi, and other pathogens by generating several different toxic chemicals, {{one of which}} is hydrogen cyanide.|$|E
25|$|RNAi {{screening}} in a Drosophila {{model has}} revealed that {{a member of the}} CD36 family is required for <b>phagocytosis</b> of Mycobacterium tuberculosis into macrophage phagosomes.|$|E
25|$|Fragmentation: The cell breaks apart into {{multiple}} vesicles called apoptotic bodies, which undergo <b>phagocytosis.</b> The {{plasma membrane}} protrusions may help bring apoptotic bodies closer to phagocytes.|$|E
25|$|CRP binds to the phosphocholine {{expressed}} on {{the surface}} of dead or dying cells and some bacteria. This activates the complement system, promoting <b>phagocytosis</b> by macrophages, which clears necrotic and apoptotic cells and bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Junk outside cells {{might be}} removed by {{enhanced}} <b>phagocytosis</b> (the normal process {{used by the}} immune system), and small drugs able to break chemical beta-bonds. The large junk in this class can be removed surgically.|$|E
25|$|Locally, the {{disruption}} of myelin due to the infiltration of T cells and macrophages, results in the <b>phagocytosis</b> of myelin by microglia or macrophages, suggesting that the T cells are presented with myelin lipids by CD1 molecules at sites of inflammation.|$|E
25|$|Asplenia {{refers to}} a non-functioning spleen, which may be congenital, damaged by trauma, or caused by disease such as sickle cell anaemia. Hyposplenia {{refers to a}} {{partially}} functioning spleen. These conditions may cause a modest increase in circulating white blood cells and platelets, a diminished response to some vaccines, and an increased susceptibility to infection. In particular, there is {{an increased risk of}} sepsis from polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria. Encapsulated bacteria inhibit binding of complement or prevent complement assembled on the capsule from interacting with macrophage receptors. <b>Phagocytosis</b> needs natural antibodies, which are immunoglobulins that facilitate <b>phagocytosis</b> either directly or by complement deposition on the capsule. They are produced by IgM memory B cells (a subtype of B cells) in the marginal zone of the spleen.|$|E
25|$|Microglia are {{specialized}} macrophages {{capable of}} <b>phagocytosis</b> that protect neurons {{of the central}} nervous system. They are derived from the earliest wave of mononuclear cells that originate in yolk sac blood islands early in development, and colonize the brain shortly after the neural precursors begin to differentiate.|$|E
25|$|Y. pestis bacilli {{can resist}} <b>phagocytosis</b> and even {{reproduce}} inside phagocytes and kill them. As the disease progresses, {{the lymph nodes}} can haemorrhage and become swollen and necrotic. Bubonic plague can progress to lethal septicemic plague in some cases. The plague is also known to spread to the lungs and become the disease known as the pneumonic plague.|$|E
