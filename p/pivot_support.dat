500|$|The inventions of the artisan-engineer Ding Huan (丁緩) are {{mentioned}} in the Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital. The official and poet Sima Xiangru (179–117 BCE) once hinted in his writings that the Chinese used a censer {{in the form of}} a gimbal, a <b>pivot</b> <b>support</b> made of concentric rings which allow the central gimbal to rotate on an axis while remaining vertically positioned. However, the first explicit mention of the gimbal used as an incense burner occurred around 180 CE when the artisan Ding Huan created his 'Perfume Burner for use among Cushions' which allowed burning incense placed within the central gimbal to remain constantly level even when moved. Ding had other inventions as well. For the purpose of indoor air conditioning, he set up a large manually operated rotary fan which had rotating wheels that were [...] in diameter. He also invented a lamp which he called the 'nine-storied hill-censer', since it was shaped as a hillside. When the cylindrical lamp was lit, the convection of rising hot air currents caused vanes placed on the top to spin, which in turn rotated painted paper figures of birds and other animals around the lamp.|$|E
30|$|Strengths of {{this study}} include the modular design of the axial load transducer, which allows for {{in-vitro}} real-time dynamic testing of radial length changes. The bone-bridge surgical technique ensures proper alignment of the device with the anatomical long-axis of the radius while maintaining the articular locations and soft-tissue constructs, such as the annular ligament. Furthermore, validation with the Instron servo-hydraulic testing frame and an external ‘gold standard’ load cell, provided a highly repeatable and controlled testing platform to measure loading of the interposed device. The ball-bearing <b>pivot</b> <b>support</b> nullified reaction moments and ensured only desired loads were measured.|$|E
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for the steady-state measurement of {{poloidal magnetic field}} near a tokamak plasma, where the tokamak is configured {{with respect to a}} cylindrical coordinate system having z, phi (toroidal), and r axes. The method is based on combining the two magnetic field principles of induction and torque. The apparatus includes a rotor assembly having a pair of inductive magnetic field pickup coils which are concentrically mounted, orthogonally oriented in the r and z directions, and coupled to remotely located electronics which include electronic integrators for determining magnetic field changes. The rotor assembly includes an axle oriented in the toroidal direction, with the axle mounted on <b>pivot</b> <b>support</b> brackets which in turn are mounted on a baseplate. First and second springs are located between the baseplate and the rotor assembly restricting rotation of the rotor assembly about its axle, the second spring providing a constant tensile preload in the first spring. A strain gauge is mounted on the first spring, and electronic means to continually monitor strain gauge resistance variations is provided. Electronic means for providing a known current pulse waveform to be periodically injected into each coil to create a time-varying torque on the rotor assembly in the toroidal direction causes mechanical strain variations proportional to the torque in the mounting means and springs so that strain gauge measurement of the variation provides periodic magnetic field measurements independent of the magnetic field measured by the electronic integrators...|$|E

50|$|To use, the {{pendulum}} was {{hung from a}} bracket on a wall, with the knife blade <b>pivots</b> <b>supported</b> on two small horizontal agate plates, {{in front of a}} precision pendulum clock to time the period. It was swung first from one pivot, and the oscillations timed, then turned upside down and swung from the other pivot, and the oscillations timed again. The small weight (c) was adjusted with the adjusting screw, and the process repeated until {{the pendulum}} had the same period when swung from each pivot. By putting the measured period T, and the measured distance between the pivot blades L, into the period equation (1), g could be calculated very accurately.|$|R

25|$|A {{gyroscope}} is a wheel {{mounted in}} two or three gimbals, which are a <b>pivoted</b> <b>supports</b> that allow the rotation of the wheel about a single axis. A set of three gimbals, one mounted on the other with orthogonal pivot axes, may be used to allow a wheel mounted on the innermost gimbal to have an orientation remaining independent of the orientation, in space, of its support. In the case of a gyroscope with two gimbals, the outer gimbal, which is the gyroscope frame, is mounted so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane determined by the support. This outer gimbal possesses one degree of rotational freedom and its axis possesses none. The inner gimbal is mounted in the gyroscope frame (outer gimbal) so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane that is always perpendicular to the pivotal axis of the gyroscope frame (outer gimbal). This inner gimbal has two degrees of rotational freedom.|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} carried out to study the dynamic {{response}} of a bluff body in a quasi-steady free surface flow in a horizontal short flume. Flow features were obtained by using of several flowmeter equipments, current meter and acoustic doppler velocimeter, in order to select different measurement control volumes and, thus, different velocity scale. The obstacle was a sphere placed in the middle cross section of the flume. Measurements were performed in the flume at Reynolds number from 10, 000 up to 60, 000, based on the sphere diameter. The drag and lift forces were measured directly at the fixed end of the <b>pivot</b> <b>supporting</b> the sphere by the use of a set of strain gauges.

40|$|Dr. R. T. Jones first {{developed}} the theory for oblique wing aircraft in 1952, and {{in subsequent years}} numerous analytical and experimental projects conducted at NASA Ames and elsewhere have established that the Jones' oblique wing theory is correct. Until the late 1980 's all proposed oblique wing configurations were wing/body aircraft with the wing mounted on a pivot. With the emerging requirement for commercial transports with very large payloads, 450 - 800 passengers, Jones proposed a supersonic oblique flying wing in 1988. For such an aircraft all payload, fuel, and systems are carried within the wing, and the wing is designed with a variable sweep to maintain a fixed subsonic normal Mach number. Engines and vertical tails are mounted on <b>pivots</b> <b>supported</b> from the primary structure of the wing.

40|$|Francis turbine {{guide vanes}} have <b>pivoted</b> <b>support</b> with {{external}} control mechanism, for conversion {{of pressure to}} kinetic energy and to direct them to runner vanes. This movement along the support is dependent on variation of load and flow (operating conditions). Small clearance gaps between facing plates and {{the upper and lower}} guide vane tips are available to aid this movement, through which leakage flow occurs. This secondary flow disturbs the main flow stream, resulting performance loss. Additionally, these increased horseshoe vortex, in presence of sand, when crosses through the gaps, both the surfaces are eroded. This causes further serious effect on performance and structural property by increasing gaps. This paper discusses the observation of the severity in hydropower plants and effect of clearance gaps on general performance of the Francis turbine through computational methods. It also relates the primary result with the empirical relation for leakage flow prediction. Additionally, a possible method to computationally estimate thickness depletion has also been presented. With increasing clearance gap, leakage increases, which lowers energy conversion and turbine efficiency along with larger secondary vortex...|$|R

40|$|In {{the field}} of modern {{large-scale}} telescope, primary mirror supporting system technology faces the difficulties of theoretically uniform output force request and bias compensation. Therefore, a novel position control system combining hydraulic system with servo motor system is introduced. The novel system ensures uniform output force on supporting points without complicating the mechanical structure. The structures of both primary mirror supporting system and novel position system are described. Then, the mathematical model of novel position control system is derived for controller selection. A proportional–derivative controller is adopted for simulations and experiments of step response and triangle path tracking. The results show that proportional–derivative controller guarantees the system with micrometer-level positioning ability. A modified proportional–derivative controller is utilized to promote system behavior with faster response overshoot. The novel position control system is then applied on primary mirror supporting system. Coupling effect is observed among actuator partitions, and relocation of virtual <b>pivot</b> <b>supporting</b> point is chosen as the decoupling measurement. The position keeping ability of the primary mirror supporting system is verified by rotating the mirror cell at a considerably high rate. The experiment {{results show that the}} decoupled system performs better with smaller bias and shorter recovery time...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of an ESTEC {{technology}} contract, a Chopping Mechanism was developed and built with the Far Infrared and Submillimeter Telescope (FIRST) astronomy mission as a reference. The task of the mechanism is to tilt the subreflector of the telescope with an assumed mass of 2. 5 kg about one chopping axis at nominal frequencies of up to 5 Hz and chopping angles of up to +/- 11. 25 mrad with high efficiency (minimum time for position change). The chopping axis is required to run through the subreflector vertex. After performing a concept trade-off also considering the low operational temperatures in the 130 K range, a design using moving magnet actuators was found to be the favorite one. In addition, a bearing concept using flexible pivots was chosen to meet the high chopping accuracy required. With this approach, a very reliable design could be realized, since the actuators work without any mechanical contact between its moving and fixed parts, and the only bearings used are two flexible <b>pivots</b> <b>supporting</b> the subreflector mounting interface. The mechanism was completely built in titanium in a lightweight and stiff design. The moving magnet actuators were designed to meet the stringent requirements for minimum risetime (time necessary to move from one angular position to a new one) in the 20 msec range. The angular position and the corresponding chopping frequency as well can be arbitrarily selected by the user...|$|R
