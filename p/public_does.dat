5|$|In {{political}} {{circles in}} The Netherlands, the announcement caused widespread irritation about his plan. Christian Democrat senator Hans Hillen remarked that Wilders' words could endanger Dutch interests. Former NATO general secretary Jaap de Hoop Scheffer advised Wilders {{not to make}} a speech, arguing that the international <b>public</b> <b>does</b> not know who is in the Dutch cabinet and who is in parliament and thus Wilders' speech could be mistaken as an official statement of the Dutch government. Also Christian Democrat party leader and acting Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Maxime Verhagen issued a warning.|$|E

However, all the major political parties from the right wing LDP to the Japanese Communist Party do support whaling. The meat ends up at Tokyo's famed Tsukiji fish market and other high-end restaurants. People previously involved in the industry have reported rampant meat embezzlement.|$|E
25|$|A state's {{tax system}} often {{reflects}} its communal {{values and the}} values of those in current political power. To create a system of taxation, a state must make choices regarding {{the distribution of the}} tax burden—who will pay taxes and how much they will pay—and how the taxes collected will be spent. In democratic nations where the public elects those in charge of establishing or administering the tax system, these choices reflect the type of community that the public wishes to create. In countries where the <b>public</b> <b>does</b> not have a significant amount of influence over the system of taxation, that system may reflect more closely the values of those in power.|$|E

25|$|Despite of {{politicians}} talks, Israeli <b>public</b> <b>does</b> {{not seem to}} share the same concern about the Iranian nuclear deal. Or rather, they do acknowledge that nuclear capability in Iran is a threat {{and they do not}} believe that the new agreement proposed by Obama will solve the situation. However, in recent polls, when asked to rank what is the major threat to Israeli security, Iran's nuclear power figured only in second position. Hamas and Hezbollah's terrorism is what concerns the most. Also when asked about internal issues, what figured as the highest concern for Israel's stability was the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians, not the Iranian nuclear threat. So, eventhough the population shares with the politicians the same concern about the nuclear threat, they do not think that should be the countrie's first issue to deal with.|$|E

2500|$|George Bush {{was widely}} seen as a [...] "pragmatic caretaker" [...] {{president}} who lacked a unified and compelling long-term theme in his efforts. Indeed, Bush's sound bite where he refers {{to the issue of}} overarching purpose as [...] "the vision thing" [...] has become a metonym applied to other political figures accused of similar difficulties. [...] "He does not say why he wants to be there", wrote columnist George Will, [...] "so the <b>public</b> <b>does</b> not know why it should care if he gets his way".|$|E

2500|$|Conservative writer Rich Lowry {{said that}} assault weapon is a [...] "manufactured term." [...] Joseph P. Tartaro of the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) wrote in 1994: [...] "One {{of the key}} {{elements}} of the anti-gun strategy to gull the public into supporting bans on the so-called 'assault weapons' is to foster confusion. As stated previously, the <b>public</b> <b>does</b> not {{know the difference between}} a full automatic and a semi-automatic firearm." [...] Robert Crook, executive director of the Coalition of Connecticut Sportsmen, said [...] "the term 'assault weapon,' as used by the media, is a media invention." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1916, Weber {{explained}} her {{philosophy of}} directing films: [...] "I'll never {{be convinced that}} the general <b>public</b> <b>does</b> not want serious entertainment rather than frivolous", and [...] "A real director should be absolute. He (or she in this case) alone knows the effects he wants to produce, and he alone should have authority in the arrangement, cutting, titling {{or anything else that}} may seem necessary to do to the finished product. What other artist has his work interfered with by someone else?... We ought to realize that the work of a picture director, worthy of a name, is creative".|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} opinion asserted that [...] "the inherent {{worth of the}} speech {{in terms of its}} capacity for informing the <b>public</b> <b>does</b> not depend upon the identity of its source, whether corporation, association, union, or individual." [...] In deciding the case, the Court rejected the argument that the Fourteenth Amendment did not apply to corporations. The Court overruled Pierce v. Society of Sisters, which stated that corporations [...] "cannot claim for themselves the liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees," [...] declaring the decision to be [...] "untenable under decisions of this Court". Instead, the Court asserted that the Due Process Clause extends freedom of speech and other First Amendment liberties to corporate entities.|$|E

2500|$|Additionally, in Disciplining {{investment}} Bankers, Disciplining the Economy: Wall Street's Institutional Culture of Crisis and the Downsizing of [...] "Corporate America", Karen Ho {{states that}} {{as we continue to}} learn more about Wall Street, we learn about each independent banker. As the banker brings their life experiences into the business, we can see the reasons for their actions. Each investor has a unique identity which contributes to the culture of Wall Street. Ideally, they live in the moment. [...] However, job insecurity and the volatile nature of the market creates a constant state of fear within the investor. Therefore, they must organize themselves and follow a pattern to ensure security, profit and prosperity for the long run. Karen Ho wishes for us to see Wall Street through the lens of the everyday investor and banker, as well as understand the experiences and everyday situations that they must endure. Ho also believes that the individuals within the public can counteract the stereotypes and negativity that both the media and society associates with Wall Street by learning more about the personal experiences of the investors and their everyday lives. Similarly to regular wage earners, Wall Street employees are just trying to earn a day's pay. Their work is sometimes undervalued, because the <b>public</b> <b>does</b> not see them in this manner. Thus, Wall Street cannot be understood in black and white terms. One needs to understand that they have a value system which is not only logical to them, but also reflective of North America's values of individual power, prestige, and social practices based on individualism. For example, throughout the 1940s and into the 1950s Manhattan was a [...] "white-only" [...] community. [...] Within that time period, {{there was a lot of}} racial segregation. The values of America and the social practices were not like they are today, so African Americans were not within the Wall Street community.|$|E

6000|$|Because it {{is quite}} {{naturally}} his business to cater for the great public; and, as before said, {{the majority of the}} <b>public</b> <b>does</b> not, never will, want sincerity; it is too disturbing. The commercial manager will answer: [...] "The great <b>public</b> <b>does</b> not dislike sincerity, it only dislikes dullness." [...] Well! Dullness is not an absolute, but a very relative term--a term likely to have a different meaning for a man who knows something about life and art from that which it has for a man who knows less. And one may remark that if the great public's standard of what is really [...] "amusing" [...] is the true one, it is queer that the plays which tickle the great public hardly ever last a decade, while the plays which do not tickle them occasionally last for centuries. The [...] "dullest" [...] plays, one might say roughly, are those which last the longest. Witness Euripides! ...|$|E

And in any case it is {{precisely}} the thing which the reading <b>public</b> <b>does.</b> It will not read unless it is tempted by the sugary sweetness of the romantic interest. It must have its hero and its heroine and its course of love that never will run smooth. For information the reader cares nothing. If he absorbs it, it must be by accident, and unawares. He passes over the heavy tomes filled with valuable fact, and settles like the random bee upon the bright flowers of contemporary romance.|$|E
60|$|But {{perhaps the}} most daring hope {{of all was the}} dream that came to Herr Wagner that his opera singers, his grouped choruses, would {{eventually}} satisfy the craving of the public for high class statuary. I am not quite sure the general <b>public</b> <b>does</b> care for statuary. I do not know whether the idea has ever occurred to the Anarchist, but, were I myself organising secret committee meetings for unholy purposes, I should invite my comrades to meet in that section of the local museum devoted to statuary. I can conceive of no place where we should be freer from prying eyes and listening ears. A select few, however, do appreciate statuary; and such, I am inclined to think, will not be weaned from their passion by the contemplation of the opera singer in his or her various quaint costumes.|$|E
