40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} an automatic diameter control system for a Czochralski crystal <b>puller</b> <b>in</b> which the <b>torque</b> on the crystal as it revolves in the melt is monitored and stabilised through changes in the melt temperature. The development of a torque magnetometer of new design having a high linearity and absolute accuracy is also described. The on-line analysis of data produced by the torque magnetometer has yielded precise values for the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of cobalt (grown by Czochralski and other techniques). The magnetometer has also been used for investigations of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the terbium/gadolinium alloys. In both cases the compatibility of the observed temperature dependences of the anisotropy with particular models is investigated...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the variations <b>in</b> <b>torque</b> induced <b>in</b> particles in electrorotation electrode arrays are sufficiently large to cause errors in electrorotation measurements. In order to avoid this, experimenters usually study particles bounded by an arbitrary region near the centre of the electrodes. By simulating the time-dependent electric field for polynomial electrodes, we have assessed the variation <b>in</b> <b>torque</b> across the centre of the array. By considering both the variation <b>in</b> applied <b>torque</b> and the dielectrophoretic force in the electrode chamber, the optimal conditions for electrorotation experiments have been determined. Further to this, by comparing the torque variation across the electrode chamber for a number of common electrode designs, a comparison of the suitability of each electrode design for multiparticle electrorotation analysis has been made...|$|R

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that action tremor persists during maximal wrist extension {{in patients with}} Parkinson's disease, and that this contributes to weakness at this joint by preventing the fully fused contraction of the forearm extensor muscles. Antiparkinsonian medication reduces the action tremor <b>in</b> <b>torque</b> and electromyographic (EMG) records, thereby improving strength at the wrist. In the present experiments, peak torque and action tremor were recorded during maximal extension of the elbow in nine patients with Parkinson's disease while they were on and off antiparkinsonian medication, and in eight age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. Peak torque and mean rectified EMG levels were reduced by 34 % and 36 %, respectively, during maximal elbow extension when patients off medication were compared {{to those in the}} treated state. Action tremor was visible <b>in</b> <b>torque</b> records and had a frequency of approximately 10 Hz both in parkinsonian patients and in normal controls. Activity of a similar frequency was often detected in EMG records, especially in patients off therapy. The absolute amplitude of action tremor <b>in</b> <b>torque</b> (A[torque]) and EMG (A[EMG]) records from the elbow was unaffected by therapy and was little different from that recorded in healthy controls. The relative action tremor <b>in</b> <b>torque</b> ([A(torque) /peak torque] x 100) and EMG ([A(EMG) /mean rectified EMG] x 100) was reduced by treatment, but this {{was the result of the}} increase <b>in</b> peak <b>torque</b> and mean rectified EMG. Thus, in contrast to the results at the wrist, antiparkinsonian medication has little effect on the 10 -Hz action tremor at the elbow. Increased strength is produced by a different mechanism which allows recruitment of triceps motor units outside of this synchronizing influence...|$|R
