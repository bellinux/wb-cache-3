One strategy to speed up similarity-based queries is parallelization on clusters using MapReduce. However, distributing data over a cluster also incurs high cost. At the same time, modern hardware offers parallelization through multi-cores and can be equipped with large main memories at low cost. We present PeARL, a data structure and algorithms for similarity-based queries on many-core servers. <b>PeARL</b> <b>indexes</b> large string collections in compressed tries which are entirely held in main memory.

40|$|Objectives: The primary {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} efficacy, cycle control and tolerability of a monophasic combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing nomegestrol acetate (NOMAC) and 17 β-oestradiol (E 2). Effects on acne were evaluated as a secondary objective. Results: were compared to those of a COC containing drospirenone (DRSP) and ethinylestradiol (EE). Methods Women (aged 1850 years) were randomised to receive NOMAC/E 2 (2. 5 mg/ 1. 5 mg) in a 24 / 4 -day regimen (n = 1591) or DRSP/EE (3 mg/ 30 μg) in a 21 / 7 -day regimen (n = 535) for 13 cycles.

Scheduled withdrawal bleedings were shorter and lighter among users of NOMAC/E 2 and were sometimes absent altogether. Intracyclic bleeding/spotting was infrequent in both groups, and decreased over time. Type and frequency of adverse events were similar to those typically reported for COCs.

40|$|Introduction: Desogestrel (DSG) is {{a third-generation}} progestin. It is {{commonly}} used in various formulations for hormonal contraception including combinations with ethinyl estradiol (EE), progestin-only pill and subdermal implants. DSG is also used in menopausal patients for hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Areas covered: The current manuscript aims to review the available data on safety and tolerability of DSG in oral contraception and HRT. The material included in the manuscript was searched and obtained via Medline, PubMed and EMBASE up to September 2012 using the search terms 'adverse events, side effects, tolerability' in combination with 'desogestrel and progestins'. Expert opinion: DSG is frequently used as contraceptive and it shows good contraceptive efficacy {{as demonstrated by the}} <b>Pearl</b> <b>indexes</b> reported in the studies reviewed in this manuscript. It is a versatile compound; in fact, it can be used either as progestin-only contraceptive or in combination with EE, and different formulations are available (such as the subdermal implant). In contraception, DSG is generally well tolerated but its use is associated with doubled risk of venous thromboembolism compared to second-generation progestins. Although DSG is efficacious in HRT, it may not represent the best choice due to the potential higher risk of breast cancer compared with progesterone or dydrogesterone...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{objective}} was to measure the rate of unintended pregnancies in women using levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems (LNG IUSs, releasing 20 mcg LNG daily) and copper intrauterine devices (IUDs) in a typical population of IUD users and to describe associated complications. MethodsA multinational, prospective, non-interventional cohort study of new users of LNG IUS and copper IUDs was performed. Following a baseline survey, study participants and their physicians completed one follow-up questionnaire after 12 months. A multifaceted four-level follow-up procedure minimized loss to follow-up. Patient-reported outcomes were validated by the treating physicians. ResultsA total of 61, 448 women with a newly inserted IUD were enrolled in six European countries between 2006 and 2012. The copper IUD cohort contained more than 30 different types. Validated 1 -year follow-up information for 58, 324 users between 18 and 50 years of age (70 % using LNG IUS, 30 % using copper IUDs) was collected. A total of 118 contraceptive failures occurred (26 LNG, 92 copper). Both types of IUD were highly effective, with overall <b>Pearl</b> <b>indices</b> of 0. 06 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 04 – 0. 09] and 0. 52 (95 % CI: 0. 42 – 0. 64) for LNG IUS and copper IUDs, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for LNG IUS vs. copper IUDs was 0. 16 (95 % CI: 0. 10 – 0. 25). Tenty-one pregnancies (7 LNG IUS, 14 copper IUD) were ectopic, yielding an adjusted hazard ratio for ectopic pregnancy of 0. 26 (95 % CI: 0. 10 – 0. 66). ConclusionsThe contraceptive failure rate was low with both IUDs. However, the LNG IUS {{was associated with a}} significantly lower risk of pregnancy, including ectopic pregnancy, than the copper IUDs. ImplicationsTo our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, multinational, prospective epidemiological study to measure and compare the contraceptive effectiveness of LNG IUSs and copper IUDs during routine clinical practice.

Both systems were similarly effective regardless of age, parity or BMI; the subgroup <b>Pearl</b> <b>Indices</b> had widely overlapping 95 % confidence intervals. Placement of LNG-IUS 8 and LNG-IUS 13 was easier (p < 0. 0001) and less painful (p < 0. 0001) in women who had delivered vaginally than in women who had not. The complete/partial expulsion rate was 2. 2 - 4. 2 % across all age and parity subgroups and higher in parous than in nulliparous women (p = 0. 004). The incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease was 0. 1 - 0. 6 % across all age and parity subgroups: nulliparous and younger women were not at higher risk than parous and older women, respectively. The ectopic pregnancy rate was 0. 3 - 0. 4 % across all age and parity subgroups. Across all age and parity subgroups, the 3 -year completion rate was 50. 9 - 61. 3 % for LNG-IUS 8 and 57. 9 - 61. 1 % for LNG-IUS 13, and was higher (p = 0. 0001) among older than younger women in the LNG-IUS 8 group only.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 A {{series of}} log storage {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine whether leachates derived from water storage of logs are acutely toxic to fish. Log segments approximately 18 inches long and 16 inches in diameter were stored in tanks and held submerged {{for a period of}} 7 days. The holding water containing leached materials was made toxic with mercury to retard biological decomposition of the leached substances. Mercury was selectively removed from leachate samples by chelation prior to biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and bioassay testing. Trout and salmon fry were subjected to the leachate water in short term acute bioassay tests. Results are reported as a median tolerance limit, (TLm), i. e., the concentration of leachate at which 50 percent of the test fish died for any given exposure time. Leachates were also tested for BOD₅, BOD k-rate, chemical oxygen demand (COD), wood sugar and <b>Pearl</b> Benson <b>Index</b> (PBI). Test results show that leachates from Douglas fir stored in fresh water exert a slight acute toxicity to fish. A TLm₉₆ of 20 percent leachate by volume, for a 50 year old Douglas fir log, was the most toxic leachate observed. Leachates from ponderosa pine, hemlock and an older fir log stored under identical conditions produced no measurable acute toxicity. Leachates contained a significant quantity of BOD and PBI exerting substances. The highest BOD₅, (1. 36 g/ft² of submerged surface area) was exerted by leachate from a ponderosa pine log segment stored with bark removed. The highest PBI valve (12. 5 g/ft²), was observed for leachate from a young Douglas fir log segment. BOD:COD ratios and BOD k-rate ranged widely for the various leachates, but were relatively low which indicated a significant fraction of non-biodegradable substances. Hoffbuhr (9) also observed a high non-biodegradable fraction in samples taken from log storage ponds. Wood sugars were found to account for {{a large part of the}} degradable portion of leachates.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Whether or not spermicides {{can reduce}} the risk of human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) transmission remains an important question for the control of heterosexual HIV transmission. The authors provide estimates from a reanalysis of one of the few observational studies on the efficacy of condoms and spermicides, used separately and together, per vaginal contact. METHODS: In this reanalysis, three different models were used to assess the efficacy of spermicides and condoms: linear (<b>Pearl</b> <b>index),</b> exponential (maximum likelihood), and monotonic (marginal likelihood). RESULTS: Reported use of barrier methods among 27, 432 contacts was as follows: condoms plus nonoxynol- 9, 39 %; condoms alone, 25 %; nonoxynol- 9 alone, 24 %; and unprotected, 11 %. Under all three models, the results indicate a strong protective effect for spermicidal suppositories. The <b>Pearl</b> <b>index</b> indicated that spermicide alone is apparently efficacious, but the efficacy per contact cannot be quantified with this approach.
