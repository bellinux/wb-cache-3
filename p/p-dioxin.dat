40|$|This article {{examines}} the thermal decomposition of alpha-cypermethrin, {{one of the most}} common pyrethroid pesticides. The objective was to identify its decomposition pathways and to gain an understanding into the formation of toxic species in the environment, including those that may behave in combustion systems, especially in fires in the environment, as precursors for PCDD/F (polychlorinated dibenzo-. <b>p-dioxins</b> and dibenzofurans). The experiments were conducted under non-oxidative conditions using a tubular reactor housed in a three-zone heating furnace and operated with a dilute stream of alpha-cypermethrin in 99. 999 % nitrogen. The condensable products were identified and quantitated, after being collected in a cold solvent trap and in an activated charcoal cartridge. The study revealed the formation of pollutants including precursors of toxic PCDD/F such as diphenyl ether and phenol. It was also found that the decomposition of alpha-cypermethrin involved parallel pathways of an unusual vinylcyclopropane rearrangement-. cum-aromatisation reaction transforming alpha-cypermethrin and a rupture of the C(O) O. C(C. N) linkage. The former is similar to that occurring in the decomposition of permethrin pesticide, whereas the latter constitutes a newly discovered channel for the formation of pollutants. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations allowed us to attribute the occurrence of the second pathway to the effect of the cyanide group in significantly weakening the O. C bond...|$|R

In order to investigate if food consumption would possibly be a significant route of exposure, we developed a method for the measurement of Dechloranes in food and feed. We showed {{that it was possible}} to extend the scope of the regular polychlorinated dibenzo-. <b>p-dioxins</b> (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), dioxin like (DL-), and non-dioxin like (NDL-) regulated PCBs clean-up and fractionation procedure to Dechloranes and that no compound degradation occurred during the strong acidic treatments used for lipid digestion. Dechloranes were measured by gas chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-QQQMS/MS). We optimized injection parameters by face centered experimental design (FCD). The electron ionization fragmentation was investigated to set appropriate multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions. Instrumental and method limits of quantitation (iLOQs and mLOQs) were determined following EU guidelines for dioxin analyses in food. A total of 88 samples were analyzed to assess the prevalence of this route of exposure to humans. Average levels of the sum of Dechloranes ranged from 10 to 31. pg/g fat, with the exception of fish, feed additives, and corn that were reported in pg/g wet weight at average levels of 9, 12, and 2. pg/g ww.

40|$|Emissions {{evolved from}} the {{pyrolysis}} and combustion of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were studied at four different temperatures (500, 700, 850 and 1000 °C) in a horizontal laboratory tubular quartz reactor in order to analyse the influence of both temperature and reaction atmosphere on the final products from thermal and oxidative reactions. It was observed that the CO 2 /CO ratio increased with temperature. Methane was the only light hydrocarbon whose yield increased with temperature up to 1000 °C. Benzene was rather stable at high temperatures, but in general, combustion at temperatures above 500 °C was enough to destroy light hydrocarbons. Semivolatile hydrocarbons were collected in XAD- 2 resin and more than 160 compounds were detected. Trends on polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) yields showed that most had a maximum at 850 °C in pyrolysis, but naphthalene at 700 °C. Formation of chlorinated aromatics was detected. A detailed analysis of all isomers of chlorobenzenes and chlorophenols was performed. Both of them reached higher total yields in combustion runs, the first ones having a maximum at 700 °C and the latter at 500 °C. Pyrolysis and combustion runs at 850 °C were conducted to study the formation of polychlorodibenzo- <b>p-dioxins</b> (PCDDs) and polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDFs). There was more than 20 -fold increase in total yields from pyrolysis to combustion, and PCDF yields represented in each case about 10 times PCDD yields.

40|$|Human risk {{assessment}} for dioxin-like compounds is typically {{based on the}} concentration measured in blood serum multiplied by their assigned toxic equivalency factor (TEF).

In this study we investigated the effect potencies of three polychlorinated dibenzo- p-dioxins (PCDDs), six polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and 10 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) relative to the reference congener 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachloro-dibenzo- <b>p-dioxin</b> (TCDD) in in vitro exposed primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and mouse splenic cells. REPs were determined based on cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 1 A 1, 1 B 1 and aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AhRR) gene expression as well as CYP 1 A 1 activity in human PBLs and Cyp 1 a 1 gene expression in murine splenic cells. Estimated median human REPs for 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -heptachlorodibenzo- <b>p-dioxin</b> (1234678 -HpCDD), 2, 3, 4, 7, 8,-pentachlorodibenzofuran (23478 -PeCDF), 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 -hexachlorodibenzofuran (123478 -HxCDF) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 -heptachlorodibenzofuran (1234789 -HpCDF) were with 0. 1, 1. 1, 1 and 0. 09, respectively, significantly higher compared to those estimated for mouse with REPs of 0. 05, 0. 45, 0. 09 and 0. 04, respectively. Opposite to these results, the estimated median human REP of 3, 3 ', 4, 4 ', 5 -pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126), was with 0. 001 30 -fold lower compared to the mouse REP of 0. 03. Furthermore, human REPs for 1234678 -HpCDD, 23478 -PeCDF, 123478 -HxCDF, 1234789 -HpCDF and PCB 126 were all outside the ± half log uncertainty range that is taken into account in the WHO-assigned TEFs. Together, these data show congener- and species-specific differences in REPs for some, but not all dioxin-like congeners tested.

The concentration-dependent effects of TCDD, PeCDF and TCDF on ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity, CYP 1 A 4 mRNA and CYP 1 A 5 mRNA expression were measured in primary hepatocyte cultures of chicken (Gallus gallus), ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), Japanese quail (Corturnix japonica), and herring gull (Larus argentatus) embryos exposed for 24 h. The results demonstrated that PeCDF was as potent as TCDD to induce CYP 1 A in chicken hepatocytes, but that PeCDF was more potent than TCDD in ring-necked pheasant, Japanese quail and herring gull hepatocytes. Moreover, the chicken {{was the most}} sensitive species to CYP 1 A induction by TCDD or TCDF, but all species were approximately equisensitive to CYP 1 A induction by PeCDF. Together these results showed that all species do not respond the same way to different DLCs, suggesting that interactions between a DLC and a species are structure- and cell type-dependent.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} soil contamination resulting from e-waste recycling activities, with a special focus on China, where many data have been collected for a decade. Soils in the e-waste areas are often contaminated by heavy metals and organic compounds, mainly polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated and polybrominated biphenyls (PCBs and PBBs), dechlorane plus (DP), hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs), polychlorinated and polybrominated dibenzo- <b>p-dioxins</b> (PCDDs and PBDDs), and polychlorinated and polybrominated dibenzofurans (PCDFs and PBDFs), while other compounds, not systematically monitored, can be found as well. Pollutants are generally present in mixtures, so pollution situations are complex and diversi¯ed with a gradient of contamination from agricultural soils to hot spots at e-waste sites and mainly in open burning areas. It has been proved that pollutants were transferred to the food chain via rice in China, and that the population was threatened since high levels of various pollutants were detected in blood, placentas, hair, etc., of residents of e-waste sites. Eventually, soil remediation techniques are reviewed. Although there are many available techniques devoted to heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants, the current techniques for the e-waste sites, where these contaminants coexist, are very sparse. Phytoremediation has been investigated and co-cropping appears as a promising approach for the slightly contaminated agricultural soils. In some cases, di®erent remediation techniques should be combined or trained, while the in°uence of coexisting contaminants and the removal sequence of contaminants should be considered. In hot spots, physical and chemical techniques {{should be used to}} reduce high pollution levels to prevent further pollutant dissemination.

We {{conducted}} a pilot study to evaluate the relationship between concentrations of PCDD/F in house dust and residential proximity to known sources, including industrial facilities and traffic. Samples from vacuum bag dust from homes of 40 residents of Detroit, Los Angeles, Seattle, or Iowa who participated in a population-based case-control study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma conducted in 1998 - 2000 were analyzed using high resolution gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry for 7 PCDD and 10 PCDF congeners considered toxic by the U.

Locations of 10 types of PCDD/F-emitting facilities {{were obtained from the}} EPA; however only 4 types were located near study homes (non-hazardous waste cement kilns, coal-fired power plants, sewage sludge incinerators, and medical waste incinerators). Relationships between concentrations of each PCDD/F and proximity to industrial facilities, freight routes, and major roads were evaluated using separate multivariate regression models for each congener. The median (inter-quartile range [IQR]) toxic equivalence (TEQ) concentration of these congeners in the house dust was 20. 3. pg/g (IQR. =. 14. 3, 32. 7). Homes within 3 or 5. km of a cement kiln had 2 to 9 -fold higher concentrations of 5 PCDD and 5 PCDF (p. <. 0. 1 in each model). Proximity to freight routes and major roads was associated with elevated concentrations of 1 PCDD and 8 PCDF. Higher concentrations of certain PCDD/F in homes near cement kilns, freight routes, and major roads suggest that these outdoor sources are contributing to indoor environmental exposures.

40|$|The aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor, which mediates toxic responses to environmental pollutants, such as 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo <b>p-dioxin</b> (TCDD) and related compounds. Besides its well known role in induction of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, for instance CYP 1 A 1, the AhR is also involved in tumor promotion in rodents although the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Additionally, the AhR is known to regulate cellular proliferation, which might result in either inhibition or stimulation of proliferation depending on the cell-type studied. Potential targets in hepatocarcinogenesis are liver oval (stem/progenitor) cells. In the present work we analyzed the effect of TCDD on proliferation in oval cells derived from mouse liver. We show that TCDD inhibits proliferation in these cells. In line, the amount of G 0 /G 1 cells increases in response to TCDD. We further show that the expression of cyclin D 1 and cyclin A is decreased, while p 27 is increased. As a result, the retinoblastoma protein is not phosphorylated thereby inducing G 0 /G 1 arrest. Pharmacological inhibition of the AhR and knock-down of AhR expression by RNA interference decreased the inhibitory effect on cell cycle and protein expression, indicating that the AhR at least partially mediates cell cycle arrest...|$|E

(1) H NMR spectra of urines collected 24 h before and after exposure were analyzed via pattern recognition by using principal component analysis (PCA). Serum biochemistry and liver histopathology indicated significant hepatotoxicity in the rats of the combined group. The PCA scores plots of urinary (1) H NMR data showed that all the treatment groups could be easily distinguished from the control group, so could the PCBs or TCDD group and the combined group. The loadings plots of the PCA revealed remarkable increases in the levels of lactate, glucose, taurine, creatine. and 2 -hydroxy-isovaleric acid and reductions in the levels of 2 -oxoglutarate, citrate, succinate, hippurate, and trimethylamine-N-oxide in rat urine after exposure. These changes were more striking in the combined group. The changed metabolites may be considered possible biomarker for the hepatotoxicity. The present study demonstrates that combined exposure to PCBs and TCDD induced significant hepatotoxicity in rats, and mitochondrial dysfunction and fatty acid metabolism perturbations might contribute to the hepatotoxicity. There was good conformity between changes in the urine metabonomic pattern and those in serum biochemistry and liver histopathology.

40|$|Abstract—In this work, {{susceptibility}} to oxidative stress was analyzed under laboratory {{conditions in the}} European eel Anguilla anguilla. Eels were treated with increasing concentrations of benchmark environmental pollutants, namely, benzo[a]pyrene ([BaP], at 0, 0. 1, 1, 10, and 50 mg/kg), b-naphthoflavone ([BNF], at 0, 0. 1, 1, 10, and 50 mg/kg), Arochlort 1254 (at 0, 0. 1, 1, 10, and 50 mg/kg), and 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo <b>p-dioxin</b> ([TCDD], at 0, 0. 01, 0. 1, 1, and 2 mg/kg). The integral relationships were analyzed between induction of ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity, its involvement in perturbing oxyradical metabolism, {{and the role of}} cytochrome P 450 and/or oxidative stress in mediating genotoxic effects. To reveal whether the oxidative status in exposed organisms was altered as a result of chemical exposure, measurements of the main endogenous antioxidant defenses were integrated with the measurement of total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) toward peroxyl radicals and hydroxyl radicals (·OH). This approach permits discriminating the resistance of a tissue toward different forms of oxyradicals, thereby indicating a differential role for specific reactive oxygen species (ROS) in perturbing the balance between prooxidant and antioxidant mechanisms. All the analyzed chemicals promoted EROD induction (reflective of CYP 1 A) and altered either the levels or the activities of the antioxidants studied, which might be anticipated to exert alterations in oxyradical metabolism. Analysis of TOSC suggested the prevalence of metabolic oxidative pathways leading to the more reactive ·OH on exposure to the chemicals studied. Of these chemicals, enhanced EROD activity correlated with genotoxic damage only in the cases of the nonhalogenated hydrocarbons BaP and BNF. The highest degree of genotoxic damage was consistently observed in organisms in which the capacity to absorb or scavenge ·OH was lowest. These data suggest a general relationship between oxidative stress and loss of DNA integrity in juvenile eels exposed to the chemicals studied herein...|$|E
40|$|This study {{combines}} {{the results of}} experimental measurements and theoretical computations to investigate the initial steps in the oxidation of dibenzo-. <b>p-dioxin</b> (DD). The aim is to discover new pathways leading {{to the formation of}} toxic species in combustion systems, as well as compounds that may act as precursors for polychlorinated dibenzo-. p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/F). The experiments were performed in a tubular reactor equipped with sampling systems for condensable and gaseous products. The reaction conditions were characterised by a residence time of 5. s and a fuel equivalence ratio of 0. 12. We investigated the effect of temperature (400 - 800 °C) on the type and the yield of the oxidative products, trapped in a cartridge, and gases collected in tedlar bags for subsequent FTIR analyses. The analyses of VOC, performed on a high resolution gas chromatograph-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (HRGC-QQQMS), identified 2 -methylbenzofuran and 3 -hydro- 2 -methylenebenzofuran as the initial products. This has been confirmed by injection of authentic standards and the application of collision induced dissociation (CID) that fragmented the isolated parent ions into specific product ions affording the identification of parent species. The oxidative decomposition of DD initiated at around 450 °C, with the evolution of VOC peaking at between 650 and 700 °C. In excess of 750 °C, all VOC were completely oxidised. The potential energy surface (PES), based on the density functional theory (DFT) of B 3 LYP, mapped the initial steps involved in the oxidation of DD, and yielded a detailed reaction scheme for the onset of oxidation of DD that results in the formation of 2 -methylbenzofuran and 3 -hydro- 2 -methylenebenzofuran.

40|$|Toxicological risk {{assessment}} for dioxin-like compounds in avian wildlife is currently limited {{by a lack}} of species sensitivity data. This gap in the literature can be partially attributed to difficulties associated with performing in vivo dosing studies with wild birds. For this reason, in vitro approaches for estimating dioxin sensitivity are required. One such bioassay measures the cytochrome P 4501 A (CYP 1 A) response to 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo- <b>p-dioxin</b> (TCDD) as ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in cultured embryo hepatocytes. Application of the EROD bioassay to {{risk assessment}} in avian wildlife is complicated by the extreme variability of the CYP 1 A response. The experiments presented in this thesis characterize factors contributing to variation in the CYP 1 A response to TCDD among individuals, populations, and species. These experiments have the dual purpose of investigating mechanisms underlying variation in dioxin sensitivity in avian species, and improving in vitro methods for obtaining species sensitivity estimates. Basal and TCDD-induced CYP 1 A mRNA expression was found to be extremely variable in hepatocyte cultures prepared from 55 individual herring gull embryos. Significant differences in basal CYP 1 A expression between populations suggested {{that there may be a}} genetic component to this variation. Possible effects of exposure to contaminants throughout development were investigated using a chicken model. Embryonic exposure to dioxin-like compounds at current environmental levels was determined to be unlikely to contribute to the CYP 1 A response to TCDD in cultured hepatocytes for all but the most contaminated individuals. Regardless of the source, variation between individuals was shown to be a confounding factor for obtaining reproducible sensitivity estimates from the CYP 1 A bioassay. Characterization of mechanisms underlying species differences in the CYP 1 A response to TCDD led to the development of novel in vitro approaches for assessing dioxin sensitivity in birds. A comparison of previously published toxicity data and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) sequences cloned from 18 avian species revealed that key amino acids in the AHR ligand binding domain predict sensitivity to dioxin-like compounds in diverse avian orders. This finding suggests that a simple genetic test could be used to identify species that are particularly sensitive to dioxin-like compounds within contaminated environments. A second series of experiments led to the development of a novel method for measuring CYP 1 A enzymatic activity (EROD) and mRNA expression in the same sample. This technique increases the versatility of the EROD bioassay and maximizes the amount of data that can be obtained from scarce tissues. Together the results presented in this thesis provide important insight into mechanisms underlying variation in dioxin sensitivity in birds, and enhance our ability to estimate risk to avian wildlife through the use of in vitro bioassays...|$|E
40|$|Polyhalogenated {{aromatic}} hydrocarbon (PHAH) {{belongs to a}} group of ubiquitous environmental contaminants. Among them, 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo- <b>p-dioxin</b> (TCDD) {{is one of the most}} toxic synthetic chemicals known. It accumulates in adipose tissues of animals and has a biological half-life estimated at 6 - 12 years in human. As an endocrine disruptor, TCDD affects plasma levels of pituitary hormones including gonadotropins (FSH/LH), PRL (PRL), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH, corticotropin), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Most, if not all, of these effects may be related to the ability of TCDD to exert antiestrogenic effects. Therefore the goal of this work was to first use microarrays to identify gene targets of TCDD in the pituitary gland in vivo and then use a pituitary-derived cell line to determine the mechanisms underlying TCDD effects on these genes. The work described in my dissertation is the first to demonstrate that TCDD acts directly on rat pituitary lactotropes and gonadotropes to interfere with E 2 regulation of genes encoding PRL and glycoprotein hormones. It is also the first to show that TCDD exerts antiestrogenic activity on the regulation of the PRL gene both in vivo and in vitro, and that this interference occurs at the transcriptional level. My findings suggest that neither activation of a putative inhibitory dioxin response element, metabolism of E 2 by CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 B 1 enzymes nor the down-regulation of the AhR is likely responsible for the antiestrogenicity of TCDD. Instead, I found that limitation of ERα, but not ERβ availability, after TCDD co-treatment with E 2 is responsible for the underlying antiestrogenic effects of TCDD on PRL gene expression. My findings suggest that it is likely that several pathways are involved in the ability of TCDD to limit ERα availability for PRL gene transcription. They are decreased ERα levels through down-regulation of ERα gene transcription; degradation of ERα through the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway, and direct interference with E 2 -induced ERα binding to an ERE enhancer in the PRL gene promoter. Interestingly, I found that at the same time TCDD interfered with ERα binding and PRL promoter activation, liganded ER enhanced gene targets of the AhR, CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 B 1. Based on these findings, I propose a novel model of cross-talk between the AhR and ER that may explain the antiestrogenic activity of TCDD in the regulation of PRL gene transcription. In this model, ligand-activated AhR/ARNT complex may sequester liganded ERα and recruit it to DREs in AhR target genes, thereby limiting availability of liganded ERα for recruitment to ERE sequences in the PRL gene. In addition to providing a novel model to explain antiestrogenic effects of TCDD, my findings that TCDD interferes with PRL and glycoprotein hormone synthesis may explain the broad range of reproductive dysfunctions caused by TCDD exposure during development and adulthood. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal {{of this research is}} to apply protein adducts as biomarkers of exposure to investigate the associations of dioxin/polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exposure with the alter expression in susceptible genes involved in the regulation of estrogen disposition and the subsequent induction of the formation of biologically active metabolites of estrogen. To test this hypothesis, differential alterations of gene expression in the regulation of metabolism and biosynthesis of endogenous estrogen will be assayed. In parallel, we will measure the levels of protein adducts of naphthalene-and estrogen-derived quinones to reflect the extent of PAH exposure and the changes in the disposition of endogenous estrogen. Specific congeners of PAHs (i. e., naphthalene) and dioxin (i. e., 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, TCDD) will be selected as modulators of gene expression and the production of estrogen-derived protein adducts. To achieve the proposed objectives, human breast normal (MCF- 10 A and MCF- 12 A) and tumoral (MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231 cells) cell lines, rodents (mice), and serum albumin derived from breast cancer patients and from healthy pregnant women will be used to study the proposed mechanisms. The specific aims are:Specific Aim # 1 - To develop an ultra-sensitive method for measuring Cys-S adducts of cysteines, glutathiones, liver proteins, albumin (Alb), and hemoglobin (Hb) based upon a modified MT-procedure that employed trifluoroacetic acid as adduct-cleavage reagent and GC-NICI-MS analysis for simutaneous quantitation of endogenous levels of estrogen quinones and naphthoquinones. (the first year) Specific Aim # 2. - To investigate the association of TCDD-induced modulation of gene expression involved in estrogen homeostasis and the subsequent formation of protein adducts of estrogen-derived quinones in human MCF- 12 A (normal) and MCF- 7 breast cancer cells and in A/J mice. (the second year) Specific Aim # 3. - To investigate the association of PAHs/dioxin exposure with the specific genotype involved in the estrogen homeostasis, the levels of estrogen quinine-derived protein adducts, and the levels of abasic sites in human subjects, including healthy preganant women and breast cancer patients (the third year) Specifically, we will examine (1) tissue dosimetry of biologically active metabolites of estrogen (i. e. estrogen 2, 3 -quinone and estrogen- 3, 4 -quinone); (2) the tissue dosimetry of biologically active metabolites of naphthalene (i. e. 1, 2 -naphthoquinone and 1, 4 -naphthoquinone); and (3) the genotyping of genes responsible for estrogen disposition (i. e., cytochrome P 450 1 A 1 and 1 B 1, COMT), oxidant defense, and DNA repair. We expect to demonstrate that chronic exposure to PAHs/dioxin can alter the expression of enzymes responsible for estrogen disposition leading to increases in tissue dose of estrogen quinones in target organs. Furthermore, levels of naphthalene- and estrogen quinone-derived adducts in blood proteins will be determined in healthy preganant women and in breast cancer patients. We believe that protein adducts of naphthalene- and estrogen quinine-derived cysteinyl adducts in blood proteins may serve as useful biomarkers of estrogen homeostasis in epidemiological studies. 台灣地區乳癌發生率已居於各個癌症之首，相較於西方，年輕化為一重要特徵；除了基因與飲食為目前探討的主要方向外，環境污染影響亦列為一個值得討討與研究的議題。本研究計畫之主旨是以蛋白質胼合物(protein adducts) 為生物指標(biomarker) ，評估多環芳香族碳氫化合物及戴奧辛之環境暴露，並對乳癌特定代謝雌性激素基因之表現及雌性激素之活性醌類代謝物累積濃度之影響，進行探討。為驗証此ㄧ研究假設，將針對調節雌性激素之生成、代謝活化、及去活化酵素之基因型(genotyping) 之差異進行測定。同時亦將針對萘及雌性激素之醌類化物所生成之蛋白質胼合物和其造成去鹼基核酸之含量，進行檢測，分別評估多環芳香族碳氫化合物之環境曝露量，及雌性激素代謝活化之改變程度差異。特定之多環芳香族碳氫化合物及戴奧辛之同屬物，包括萘及TCDD (2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo- <b>p-dioxin)</b> ，將選為雌性激素所產生之蛋白質胼合物潛在改變因子。為達成此一研究目的，將以人類之正常(MCF- 10 A；MCF- 12 A) 及腫瘤細胞株(MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231 cells) 、齧齒類實驗動物(mice) 、曝露於PAHs及dioxin環境之人類族群血清和乳癌罹患族群血清，進行探討其相關之機制。主要之三個特定目標敘述如下：特定目標一：以MT分析法為基礎，發展一靈敏之微量分析法，同步檢測萘及雌性激素醌類代謝物所生成之半胱胺酸、麩胺基硫、肝蛋白、血清白蛋白、紅血球蛋白胼合物。此一流程將以三氟醋酸為衍生切除劑，並以氣相層析質譜儀進行分析。(第一年) 特定目標二：將以人類正常(normal) 及腫瘤(turmor) 乳癌腫瘤細胞株、A/J小鼠模式，探討dioxin誘發雌性激素衡定性相關之基因表現改變，及對後續雌性激素活性代謝物之蛋白質胼合物(cytoplasmic protein；hemoglobin) 生成之相關性。(第二年) 特定目標三：將針對一般族群、懷孕婦女、及乳癌患者，探討維持雌激素衡定性之特定基因型，與雌激素活性醌類代謝物之體內蛋白質胼合物(hemoglobin and albumin adducts) 以及去鹼基核酸(abasic sites) 含量相關性。(第三年) 本研究將特別針對(1) 雌性激素之醌類活性代謝物包括estrogen- 2, 3 -quinone及estrogen- 3, 4 -quinone之累積組織劑量之推估；(2) 萘之醌類代謝物包括 1, 2 -naphthoquinone及 1, 4 -naphthoquinone之累積組織劑量之推估；(3) 分析維持雌性激素衡定性之特定基因型包括cytochrome P 4501 A 1 / 1 B 1,COMT。本研究預計將能呈現與驗證長期曝露於PAHs/dioxin環境中族群，對其體內之雌性激素代謝活化酵素將有誘發現象，進而導致活性之醌類代謝物蛋白質胼合物大量累積。此外於乳癌患者血清應可檢測出較高的胼合物累積量。本研究預期此一蛋白質胼合物分析法，將能作為一高效率之生物指標，提供流行病學中對評估PAHs及dioxin長期曝露對雌性激素代謝活化之影響提供重要之資訊...|$|E
