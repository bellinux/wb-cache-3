40|$|Bibliometric {{methods are}} used in {{multiple}} fields {{for a variety of}} purposes, namely for research evaluation. Most bibliometric analyses have in common their data sources: Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (WoS) and Elsevier's Scopus. This research compares the journal coverage of both databases in terms of fields, countries and languages, using Ulrich's extensive <b>periodical</b> <b>directory</b> as a base for comparison. Results indicate that the use of either WoS or Scopus for research evaluation may introduces biases that favor Natural Sciences and Engineering as well as Biomedical Research to the detriment of Social Sciences and Arts and Humanities. Similarly, English-language journals are overrepresented to the detriment of other languages. While both databases share these biases, their coverage differs substantially. As a consequence, the results of bibliometric analyses may vary depending on the database used. Comment: Accepted for publication in Scientometrics. 17 pages, 6 Figures, 4 Table...|$|R

40|$|As {{channels}} of communicating HIV/AIDS research information, serial publications and particularly journals are increasingly used {{in response to}} the pandemic. The last few decades have witnessed a proliferation of sources of HIV/AIDS-related information, bringing many challenges to collection-development librarians as well as to researchers. This study uses an informetric approach to examine the growth, productivity and scientific impact of these sources, during the period 1980 to 2005, and especially to measure performance in the publication and dissemination of HIV/AIDS research about or from eastern or southern Africa. Data were collected from MEDLINE, Science Citation Index (SCI), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), and Ulrich’s <b>Periodical</b> <b>Directory.</b> The analysis used Sitkis version 1. 5, Microsoft Office Access, Microsoft Office Excel, Bibexcel, and Citespace version 2. 0. 1. The specific objectives were to identify the number of sources of HIV/AIDS-related information that have been published in the region, the coverage of these in key bibliographic databases, the most commonly used publication type for HIV/AIDS research, the countries in which the sources are published, the sources’ productivity in terms of numbers of papers and citations, the most influential sources, the subject coverage of the sources, and the core sources of HIV/AIDS-information...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the journal bibliometric {{characteristics}} of the Journal of Information Science (JIS) and the subject relationship with other disciplines by citation analysis. The citation data were drawn from references of each article of JIS during 1998 and 2008. The Ulrich’s <b>Periodical</b> <b>Directory,</b> Library of Congress Subject Heading, retrieved from the WorldCat and LISA database were used to identify the main class, subclass and subject of cited journals and books. The results of this study revealed that journal articles are the most cited document, followed by books and book chapters, electronic resources, and conference proceedings, respectively. The three main classes of cited journals in JIS papers are “library science, ” “social sciences ” and “science. ” The three subclasses of non-LIS journals that were highly cited in JIS papers are “industries. land use. labor”, “mathematics. computer science, ” and “science. ” The three highly cited subjects of library and information science journals encompass “searching, ” “information work, ” and “World Wide Web. ” The highly cited main classes of books in JIS papers are “Social sciences,” followed by “library and information science, ” “science, ” “philosophy. psychology. religion. ” The three highly cited subclasses of books in JIS papers are “books (general). writing. paleography. book industrie...|$|R

40|$|Given the {{distinct}} {{nature of the}} Canadian banking system, {{it is important for}} novice researchers to know which business and legal resources to consult in order to quickly find information that is particular to Canadian banking. However, there are very few articles or monographs in the library literature that describe how to find information sources exclusively on this subject from a Canadian perspective. Most available publications tend to specialize in sources for the US banking and Federal Reserve System with little attention to Canada. The paper begins with a brief introduction to Canadian banking. From there, the authors demonstrate where researchers can find primary sources such as legislation, regulations and case law. In addition, this article identifies and discusses the different types of information found on the websites of associations and government agencies such as the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, which supervises and regulates various areas of Canada’s financial system. Also discussed are secondary sources such as industry research and reports that are available from reliable websites and subscription-based resources. This paper also explores the best business and legal databases for researchers. Based on results from searching in <b>periodical</b> <b>directories</b> and indexes, the paper additionally provides a description of the most pertinent academic, trade and general publications relevant to the Canadian banking system and where their contents are indexed...|$|R
