In this contribution, an approach for estimation of the eye and mouth corner <b>point</b> <b>positions</b> is presented. For this proposition, the location informations of the face model are exploited to define search areas for estimation of the eye and mouth corner <b>point</b> <b>positions.</b> Then, the eye and mouth corner <b>point</b> <b>positions</b> are estimated based on a template matching technique with eye and mouth corner templates. Finally, in order to verify these estimated corner <b>point</b> <b>positions,</b> some geometric conditions between the corner <b>point</b> <b>positions</b> and the center <b>point</b> <b>positions</b> of the eyes and the mouth are exploited.

The latest upgraded version of the experimental set up, and the basic differences between conventional joint angle feedback and end <b>point</b> <b>position</b> feedback are described. A general procedure for application of modern control methods to the problem is outlined. The relationship between weighting parameters and the bandwidth and control stiffness of the resulting end <b>point</b> <b>position</b> closed loop system is shown. It is found that joint rate angle feedback {{in addition to the}} primary end <b>point</b> <b>position</b> sensor is essential for adequate disturbance rejection capability of the closed loop system. The use of a low order multivariable compensator design computer code; called Sandy is documented. A {{solution to the problem of}} control mode switching between position sensor sets is outlined. The proof of concept for endpoint position feedback for a one link flexible manipulator was demonstrated. The bandwidth obtained with the experimental end <b>point</b> <b>position</b> controller is about twice as fast as the beam's first natural cantilevered frequency, and comes within a factor of four of the absolute physical speed limit imposed by the wave propagation time of the beam...|$|R

50|$|<b>Point</b> <b>positioning</b> is the {{determination}} of the coordinates of a point on land, at sea, or in space with respect to a coordinate system.

50|$|A {{positioning}} goniometer or goniometric {{stage is}} a device used to rotate an object precisely (within a small angular range) about a fixed axis in space. Its appearance {{is similar to}} that of a linear stage. However, rather than moving linearly with respect to its base, the stage platform rotates partially about a fixed axis above the mounting surface of the platform. The distance of the center of rotation from the platform mounting surface is often chosen so that two different goniometer models may be stacked in an X-Y configuration and both stages will rotate about the same <b>point.</b> <b>Positioning</b> goniometers typically use a worm drive with a partial worm wheel fixed to the underside of the stage platform meshing with a worm in the base. The worm may be rotated manually or by a motor as in automated positioning systems.|$|E

Using the law of error propagation, rigorous analytical derivation of error formulas was performed to obtain a reliable assessment of the achievable <b>point</b> <b>positioning</b> accuracy. For practical use, based on the derived analytical formulas, accuracy figures and tables have been developed. In this paper select example figures illustrate the achievable <b>point</b> <b>positioning</b> accuracies of state-of-the-art LiDAR systems for various accuracies of the parameters that influence the LiDAR <b>point</b> <b>positioning</b> accuracy. The analytical derivation-based accuracy plots {{can also be used}} as a tool for choosing the right system or system configuration for a desired mapping accuracy, and to help the flight planning, i. e. selecting optimal flight parameters for a given system to achieve the desired <b>point</b> <b>positioning</b> accuracy.
