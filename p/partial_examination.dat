50|$|For grades fifth to twelfth, a 1 to 10 {{grading system}} is used with 10 being the best, 1 being {{the worst and}} 5 being the minimum passing grade. The system of {{continuous}} assessment is also used, with individual marks for each test, oral examination, project, homework or classwork being entered in the register (these individual marks are known as note). There {{must be at least}} as many note for a subject as the number of weekly classes for that subject plus one. Some subjects also require a <b>partial</b> <b>examination</b> {{at the end of the}} semester (teză). This requirement is however regulated by the Ministry as mandatory. The partial is valued at 25% of the final mark, and for grades 5 to 8 it applies to Romanian Language and Mathematics and only in the eight year, Geography or History, and in the case of a bilingual school or one with teaching in a minority language, that particular language. At the end of each semester, an average is computed following a four-step procedure: first, all marks are added and an arithmetical average is computed from those marks. If there is a thesis, this average, with 0.01 precision, is multiplied by 3, the mark at the teză (rounded to the nearest integer) is added, then everything is divided by 4. This average (with or without teză) is then rounded to the closest integer (5/4 system - thus 9.5 is 10) and forms the semester average per subject. The next step is computing the yearly average per subject. This is done by adding the two semester averages per subject and divided by 2. This is not rounded. The last step is adding all the yearly averages per subject and dividing that amount by the total number of subjects. This forms the yearly grade average (media generală). This is neither weighted nor rounded. If the yearly average per subject is below 5 for a maximum of two subjects, then the student must take a special exam (corigență) at the failed subject in August, in front of a school board. If he fails this exam, he must repeat the entire year (repetenție). If the yearly average per subject is below 5 for three subjects or more, the student is no longer entitled to the special exam and must repeat the year.|$|E

40|$|Based on coronial data {{gathered}} {{in the state of}} Queensland in 2004, this article reviews how a change in legislation may have impacted autopsy decision making by coroners. More specifically, the authors evaluated whether the requirement that coronial autopsy orders specify the level of invasiveness of an autopsy to be performed by a pathologist was affected by the further requirement that coroners take into consideration a known religion, culture, and/or raised family concern before making such an order. Preliminary data reveal that the cultural status of the deceased did not affect coronial autopsy decision making.

40|$|An {{increasingly}} noticeable {{feature of}} American society {{is the presence}} of newly formed groups of private citizens concerned with preventing and preparing for possible disasters or with recovering from actual impacts of such types of community crises. Their increased visibility and activity is probably reflective of broader trends in the country on the rights of consumers, and emphasis on participatory democracy, and an interest in organized self help, that are some of the legacies of the social turmoil of the late 60 ’s and early 70 ’s (for a <b>partial</b> <b>examination</b> of the historical background, see Boyte, 1980).

40|$|Objectives: Partial {{recording}} protocols may be {{used for}} the purpose of assessing periodontal disease extent and severity in epidemiological studies. As there is very little data at present regarding the reliability of any <b>partial</b> <b>examination</b> methods among Indian populations, as an initial study, an attempt was made to determine the reliability of 9 different protocols in estimating the extent and severity of periodontal disease among periodontitis patients in a central Indian population. Study Design: Probing depths (PD) and clinical attachment levels (CAL) were recorded in 85 periodontitis patients on 6 sites on all the teeth excluding the third molars. Nine partial recording protocols (PRP) were compared with the full-mouth examination. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated for mean PD, mean CAL, and percentage of sites with various thresholds of PD and CAL to determine the agreement between the PRP and the full-mouth examination. The sensitivity of different PRP for defining prevalence of sites with PD ≥ 6 and ≥ 7 mm and CAL ≥ 7 and ≥ 8 mm was also determined. Results: For all the tested PRP, the ICCs were consistently > 0. 9. The methods involving examination of 4 sites/ tooth slightly over-estimated the disease extent and severity in comparison with the full-mouth examination as well as PRP involving examination of 6 sites/tooth. Conclusions: The findings of the present study suggest that the tested PRP are in good agreement with the fullmouth examination.

40|$|Introduction: Metallosis {{involving}} the knee joint most often results from metal-on-metal contact {{late in the}} life of a failing implant following polyethylene wear. We report a case of acute metallosis following knee arthroplasty in a previously healthy 59 -year old male. Case Report: In June 2011, the patient underwent left knee arthroplasty for severe osteoarthritis with necrosis and bone edema in the medial femoral condyle and tibial plateau. Nine months later, because of persistent pain and swelling in the joint, revision arthroplasty was undertaken along with <b>partial</b> synovectomy. <b>Examination</b> revealed pristine prosthetic implants in the absence of loose fragments of bone or glue. Synovial pathology exhibited marked chronic inflammation and hyperplasia with extensive finely granular foreign material resembling metallic debris. Laboratory analysis of synovium revealed a predominance of iron, the principal component of the saw blades. Conclusion: We hypothesize the patient experienced acute metallosis resulting from deposition of metallic fragments from three saw blades used during arthroplasty. We believe the increased density of the patient’s bone that required use of multiple blades may have resulted, in part, from heavy lifting the patient partook in during the two years preceding arthroplasty.
