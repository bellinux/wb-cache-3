5000|$|Donald Sinden, then a {{contract}} star for the Rank Organisation at Pinewood Studios, had a <b>permanent</b> <b>dressing</b> {{room in the}} same block as Hepburn's. He said, [...] "Katharine Hepburn was delightful and most professional, but what was deemed {{by some to be}} 'professional' can also be called 'temperamental' by others. I happened to be on the set of The Iron Petticoat while Miss Hepburn was blowing off steam about something in a professional/temperamental manner. Bob Hope came to the rescue and with his superb sense of humour said to her, [...] "If you don't behave yourself. I'll tell everyone that you are Audrey Hepburn's father!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Donald Sinden, then a {{contract}} star for the Rank Organisation at Pinewood Studios, had a <b>permanent</b> <b>dressing</b> {{room in the}} same block as Ladd's. He said [...] "(Ladd) brought in his entourage a double-cum-stunt man who bore an uncanny resemblance to him. The double did all the long shots, most of the medium shots and even appeared in two-shots when the hero had {{his back to the}} camera. The 'star' only did eleven days work in the entire film. He was extremely short in stature and unless he was alone, the camera could never show his feet, because if he was stationary he was standing on a box; if walking, the other actors were in specially dug troughs or ditches and for anything between, all other actors were required to stand with their legs apart and their knees bent." ...|$|E
5000|$|Donald Sinden, then a {{contract}} star for the Rank Organisation at Pinewood Studios, had a <b>permanent</b> <b>dressing</b> room four doors from Monroe's during the filming, although working on different movies. He said [...] "She was still {{suffering from the}} effects of The Method school of acting, so one day I had the props department make up a notice that I fixed to my door saying: [...] "Office of the Nazak (Kazan, backwards) Academy. You too can be inaudible. New egos superimposed. Motivations immobilised. Imaginary stone-kicking eradicated. Um's & Er's rendered obsolete. Motto: 'Though 'Tis Method Yet There's Madness In It'." [...] I waited inside and presently heard the usual footsteps of her and her entourage. They paused outside and from the entire group I only heard one laugh—that of Monroe. The door burst open and in she came, slamming the door in the faces of her livid retainers. From that moment on, whenever the poor girl could not face the problems of her hybrid existence—which was frequently—she popped in for a natter and a giggle. Of course as a sex symbol she was stunning, but sadly, she must be one of the silliest women I have ever met." ...|$|E
5000|$|Francis [...] "Kris" [...] Fisher is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the British Channel 4 soap opera, Hollyoaks, played by Gerard McCarthy. The character first appeared on-screen in September 2006 {{and left in}} August 2010 after McCarthy quit the show. He is noted for his storylines involving the PEP drug, a bisexual love triangle, his outlandish personality and being the only <b>permanent</b> cross <b>dressing</b> character in a British soap opera. Following his departure, {{it was announced that}} McCarthy would return in November 2010 for a short stint.|$|R
50|$|The McGee Park Convention Center, {{built in}} 2006, {{features}} 49500 sq ft {{of space and}} can seat up to 5,757. It is used for concerts, conventions, trade shows, banquets, and other special events. There is a 40-by-60-foot <b>permanent</b> stage, two <b>dressing</b> rooms, and a concession area, among other amenities,at the center.|$|R
40|$|Tattoos and piercings {{can become}} a mask to hide behind? Everything {{can become a}} mask if we use it for masquerading. The tattoo is the anthropological roots of ancient and modern makeup that refers to the mask {{understood}} as that which creates the face, which gives it its social being. The tattoo is also an artistic decoration that should be born by the deep desire to communicate yourself to others. Tattoos {{must be able to}} "tell" the people who wear them, but if the latter decorate their body with a message or image that does not belong, it can cause the destruction of individuality. The tattoo is immortal. It can be a <b>permanent</b> <b>dress,</b> a way to resist the unwanted transformations using a piece of subjective identity, non-imitable, from which one cannot be excluded. Along with careful identification of psycho-sociological motivations that drive a young man to want a tattoo, you need to traverse an education that not only form a personality, teaches the knowledge of his own body. Getting a tattoo means not only change the morphology of the body but the risk of jeopardizing their health. Responsibility for their own health also means being aware that a tattoo can procure mild side effects or more severe depending on the initial state of health of the subject. Then a tattoo only after a careful history following the favorable opinion of the doctor and after a personal assessment aware. These initial objectives of a path bioethical-pedagogical significant...|$|R
60|$|The Institutions of this country, {{like the}} Institutions {{of all other}} countries, are but half-truths; they are the working daily {{clothing}} of the nation; no more the body's <b>permanent</b> <b>dress</b> than is a baby's frock. Slowly but surely they wear out, or are outgrown; and in their fashion they are always thirty years at least behind the fashions of those spirits who are concerned with what shall take their place. The conditions that dictate our education, the distribution of our property, our marriage laws, amusements, worship, prisons, and all other things, change imperceptibly from hour to hour; the moulds containing them, being inelastic, do not change, but {{hold on to the}} point of bursting, and then are hastily, often clumsily, enlarged. The ninety desiring peace and comfort for their spirit, the ninety of the well-warmed beds, will have it that the fashions need not change, that morality is fixed, that all is ordered and immutable, that every one will always marry, play, and worship {{in the way that they}} themselves are marrying, playing, worshipping. They have no speculation, and they hate with a deep hatred those who speculate with thought. This is the function they were made for. They are the dough, and they dislike that yeasty stuff of life which comes and works about in them. The Yeasty Stuff--the other ten--chafed by all things that are, desirous ever of new forms and moulds, hate in their turn the comfortable ninety. Each party has invented for the other the hardest names that it can think of: Philistines, Bourgeois, Mrs. Grundy, Rebels, Anarchists, and Ne'er-do-weels. So we go on! And so, as each of us is born to go his journey, he finds himself in time ranged on one side or on the other, and joins the choruses of name-slingers.|$|R
50|$|In 1963, {{community}} theater volunteers {{contacted the}} Middlesex County Board of Chosen Freeholders asking for financial support in their endeavor {{to find a}} space to produce shows in the summer months. With only enough funding budgeted to construct a storage shed, a compromise was met. In the summer, the shed would {{be used as a}} theater, and in the winter it would be used for storage. A grove in Roosevelt Park was chosen as the site, and Plays-in-the-Park opened in 1963. Since then, the theater has {{become an integral part of}} the community, especially during the summer months. It is now a <b>permanent</b> structure with <b>dressing</b> rooms and a scenic shop.|$|R
50|$|The Highlanders {{when first}} {{announced}} were to begin {{playing in a}} 4500-seat stadium; however, the West Shore Parks and Recreation stadium proposal at the Juan de Fuca velodrome in Colwood did not proceed, and the stadium in Langford was down-sized to the minimum acceptable size of 1600 seats, 1200 of which are <b>permanent.</b> It has <b>dressing</b> rooms, concessions, luxury boxes, and the playing surface is field turf. Capacity concerns regarding dressing rooms, field space, mid-field seating capacity, and training time conflicts for the four Highlander teams with the Victoria Rebels Football Club of the Canadian Junior Football League and other tenants resulted in the move downtown to Royal Athletic Park in 2011. The primary concern reported in the media was lack of seating capacity.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{shoelace}} accessories. There are hooks to help lace shoelaces tightly. They are especially useful for skates where tight lacing is important. Shoelace covers protect the laces, especially in wrestling. Shoelace charms are decorative, as are colored shoelaces. Some laces are colored using expensive dyes, other, more [...] "personal" [...] colors, are drawn-on with <b>permanent</b> markers. Some <b>dress</b> codes (especially high schools) will specifically exclude color laces and charms. Lace-locks hold laces together, {{eliminating the need}} for tying. There are shoelace tags, sometimes called deubré, with two holes or slots through which the shoelace is passed. These are worn on the section of shoelace closest to the toes, in other words the last lace, so that the image or writing on the tag is visible (as can be seen at right).|$|R
5000|$|House {{frequently}} says, [...] "Everybody lies", but jokingly remarked he {{was lying}} when he said it. House criticizes social etiquette for lack of rational purpose and usefulness. Dr. Cameron states in the first episode of the first season [...] "House doesn't believe in pretense ... so he just says what he thinks". In the season three episode [...] "Lines in the Sand", he explains how he envies an autistic patient because society allows the patient to forgo the niceties that he must suffer through. In the same episode, Dr. Wilson suggests House might have Asperger syndrome, which {{is characterized by a}} number of traits found in House, such as difficulty accepting the purpose of social rules, lack of concern for his physical appearance, and resistance to change; though he later reveals to House that he does not truly believe this, and that claiming this was a part of a ploy to soften Cuddy's opinion of House. House is a strong nonconformist and has little regard for how others perceive him. Throughout the series, he displays sardonic contempt for authority figures. House shows an almost constant disregard for his own appearance, possessing a <b>permanent</b> stubble and <b>dressing</b> informally in worn jeans, wrinkled shirts over rumpled T-shirts, and sneakers. He avoids wearing the standard white lab coat to avoid patients recognizing him as a doctor, preferring a shabby blazer or, less frequently, a motorcycle jacket.|$|R
