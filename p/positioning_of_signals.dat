40|$|The {{study of}} mapping and {{interaction}} of co-localized proteins at a sub-cellular level {{is important for}} understanding complex biological phenomena. One of the recent techniques to map co-localized proteins {{is to use the}} standard immuno-fluorescence microscopy in a cyclic manner (Nat Biotechnol 24 : 1270 – 8, 2006; Proc Natl Acad Sci 110 : 11982 – 7, 2013). Unfortunately, these techniques suffer from variability in intensity and <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> from protein markers within a run and across different runs. Therefore, it is necessary to standardize protocols for preprocessing of the multiplexed bioimaging (MBI) data from multiple runs to a comparable scale before any further analysis can be performed on the data. In this paper, we compare various normalization protocols and propose {{on the basis of the}} obtained results, a robust normalization technique that produces consistent results on the MBI data collected from different runs using the Toponome Imaging System (TIS). Normalization results produced by the proposed method on a sample TIS data set for colorectal cancer patients were ranked favorably by two pathologists and two biologists. We show that the proposed method produces higher between class Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and lower within class KL divergence on a distribution of cell phenotypes from colorectal cancer and histologically normal samples.

40|$|In this {{research}} a comparison {{has been made}} between on one side the Dutch signalling system with ATB-EG train protection {{and on the other}} side the European signalling system ETCS Level 2. The minimum feasible headway times at bottlenecks for both systems have been compared. A selection has been made of the 22 most relevant train sequences on six often occurring infrastructure layouts. For each layout, the <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> (for ATB) or block limits (for ETCS) has been sought that leads to the lowest feasible headway time for between one and four train sequences. To enable fast calculation and comparison of the headway times at different signal positionings a spreadsheet calculation model has been developed for both signalling systems. In 15 of the 22 train sequences, the European system ETCS L 2 yielded a shorter headway time than the Dutch system ATB-EG. The improvements ranged from 1, 1 s to 21, 3 s, which corresponds to savings of up to 21 %. In the other 7 train sequences, the headway times found in {{this research}} for ETCS L 2 were higher than those that could be reached in the Dutch signalling system when applying the appropriate signal positions. When averaged over all 22 train sequences, ETCS L 2 gives a 4, 5 % reduction of the headway time. When only averaging the 16 train sequences that don’t involve freight trains, the reduction more than doubles to an average of 9, 3 %. The main differences between the two signalling systems that contribute to the better performance of the European system are the fact that the braking curves are block-independent, train-dependant and speed-dependant and that there is a very low minimum block length. The research presented three types of limitations that could prevent signals from being placed on the exact location where they would be needed (level crossings, overhead section breaks and neutral overhead section breaks) and investigated the sensitivity of the found minimum headway times, which showed that the values found for ETCS L 2 are much more robust and that the required block limit positionings contain much more flexibility. The results from the research were applied on the corridor Weesp – Almere Oostvaarders, showing again that ETCS would bring more buffer time increases and require less infrastructure adaptations. To improve the accuracy of future studies comparing the Dutch and European signalling systems, focus should be put on obtaining more certainty about the ETCS braking curves of the representative Dutch passenger rolling stock.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} remove {{noise in the}} broken wire <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> wire rope, a new {{denoising}} algorithm based on the correlation of inter scales wavelet coefficient was proposed. Because the wavelet coefficient <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> has strong correlation and the wavelet coefficient of noise does not has obvious correlation, {{in the process of}} calculating threshold, an inter scales correlation factor was constructed considering the part specialty of next scale on the same position after wavelet transform. The proposed factor can adaptively adjust threshold on the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> and noise, thereby otaining good denoising effect and holding the break information in original signal. The actual processing effect of simulation and damage <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> wire rope shows that the proposed method, compared with the classical threshold, not only effectively removes noise in original signal and improve the signal noise ratio(SNR),but also retains the break information <b>of</b> inspected damage <b>signal</b> <b>of</b> wire rope...|$|R

40|$|We present two {{approaches}} for the localization of passive nodes in {{a communication network}} using ambient radio or sound signals.

The first approach, Iterative Cone Alignment, deals with arbitrary <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals.</b> It solves iteratively a non-linear optimization problem of time differences of arrival (TDOA) by a physical spring-mass simulation. Given a sufficient number <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> the approach converges towards a unique solution.

50|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> source, a second set of measurements is required. Typically, this is done by making DTO and DFO measurements for a reference signal simultaneous with the target signal measurement. The measurement <b>of</b> the reference <b>signal</b> is purely passive and simply serves to remove the biases in the system. The same measurements that are made for the target signal, DTO and DFO, are made for the reference signal. The key to a reference signal is that the transmit location <b>of</b> that <b>signal</b> is known. By comparing the DTO <b>of</b> the reference <b>signal</b> and the DTO <b>of</b> the target <b>signal</b> a result known as Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) can be calculated. Likewise, from the DFO of the target and the DFO <b>of</b> the reference <b>signal,</b> a Frequency Difference of Arrival (FDOA) can be determined. The TDOA and FDOA results provide a finite number of locations on the Earth’s surface, and therefore, lines <b>of</b> <b>position</b> (LOPs) are determined from the TDOA and FDOA results.|$|R
