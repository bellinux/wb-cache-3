5000|$|Stencils {{were popular}} {{as a method}} of book illustration, and for that purpose the {{technique}} was at its height of popularity in France during the 1920s when André Marty, Jean Saudé and many other studios in Paris specialised in the technique. Low wages contributed to the popularity of the highly labour-intensive process. When stencils are used in this way they are often called [...] "pochoir".In the <b>pochoir</b> process, a print with the outlines of the design was produced, and a series of stencils were used through which areas of color were applied by hand to the page. To produce detail, a collotype could be produced which the colors were then stenciled over. <b>Pochoir</b> was frequently used to create prints of intense color, and is most often associated with Art Nouveau and Art Deco design.|$|E
50|$|That same year, {{at the age}} of 74, Matisse began Jazz. His assistants helped {{prepare the}} collages for printing, using a stencil process known as <b>pochoir</b> in French.

5000|$|The {{style and}} {{subject matter of}} DeWoody's work has evolved {{significantly}} over the years. His earliest work was figurative. His work became totally abstract in the 1970s, when he created paintings and prints with collaged, multi-colored torn papers, which gave them a sculptural dimension, {{and a series of}} works incorporating abstracted towers and zig zags. He returned to figurative work in the 1980s and years since, but {{with a wide range of}} techniques and subject matter, in several series of works, including “heroic” portraits of sports figures and buildings. Most of these were created with a hard-edged <b>pochoir</b> technique which DeWoody adapted from the earlier French <b>pochoir</b> tradition. Subsequently, he moved to screened monoprinting for a series of portraits of [...] "Perps", [...] "Babes", and Asians. Most recently the Asian series has shifted to Asian-made objects: Japanese porcelain figures and Chinese plastic toys in conversation tableaux.|$|E
50|$|Julian {{has also}} worked {{extensively}} with various printmaking techniques since 1982 (lithography, woodcut, intaglio, <b>pochoir,</b> silkscreen and monotype).

50|$|In 1905, Georgiana {{arranged}} {{the publication of}} The Flower Book, a limited-edition facsimile of an album of watercolour flower paintings by Edward Burne-Jones. Three hundred copies were issued {{in cooperation with the}} Fine Art Society of London. It was printed by Henri Piazza, who hand-stencilled watercolour over collotypes using the <b>pochoir</b> technique to produce brilliant colours.These copies of the Flower Book were sold in both bound and unbound form, with the unbound copies contained in a clamshell box.|$|E
5000|$|On his death, Burne-Jones {{left the}} album of flower {{paintings}} {{to his wife}} Georgiana, and she published a facsimile edition of 300 copies in 1905 in co-operation with the Fine Art Society in London. It was printed by Henri Piazza, who hand-stencilled watercolour over collotypes using the <b>pochoir</b> technique to produce brilliant colours.These copies of the [...] "Book" [...] were sold in both bound and unbound form, with the unbound copies contained in a clamshell box.|$|E
5000|$|The {{illustrations}} {{in these}} three works, along with many others of Hémard's, were printed in color using the [...] "pochoir" [...] (French for stencil) method in which stencils for each color to be printed are hand cut, typically out of celluloid or plastic, and the colors painted on using special brushes. <b>Pochoir</b> produces intensely colored prints with a distinct fresh look and {{is best known for}} its use in French Art Nouveau and Art Deco prints in the early 20th Century.|$|E
50|$|La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France (Prose of the Trans-Siberian and of Little Jehanne of France) is a {{collaborative}} artists' book by Blaise Cendrars and Sonia Delaunay-Terk. The book features {{a poem by}} Cendrars about a journey through Russia on the Trans-Siberian Express in 1905, during the first Russian Revolution, interlaced with an almost-abstract <b>pochoir</b> print by Delaunay-Terk. The work, published in 1913, is considered a milestone {{in the evolution of}} artist's books as well as modernist poetry and abstract art.|$|E
50|$|Montaut's printmaking career {{started in}} the late 19th century. He used a lithographic stone to produce an outline of the image, the <b>Pochoir</b> process, often {{including}} the year of publication, the artist's name {{and that of the}} printer Mabileau et Cie., Paris. Printed on the image was also a descriptive title advertising cars, tires, carburettors etc., and various sponsoring firms. The outlines were then painted by hand using watercolour paints. The process took a few days for each print and was quite labour-intensive. The different artists resulted in noticeable variations in colour.|$|E
50|$|While Jacobson did {{not wish}} to dictate subject matter to the {{remaining}} five artists, he actively promoted their work. He arranged for their work to be shown at the Denver Art Museum. In 1928, Jacobson entered their watercolor paintings in the First International Art Exposition in Prague, Czechoslovakia, where they received international acclaim. Their work continued to be exhibited throughout Europe. In 1929, Jacobson collaborated with a French printer to produce Kiowa Art, a portfolio of 24 <b>pochoir</b> prints of their paintings of intertribal dancers, ceremonies, musicians, and Kiowa daily life.|$|E
5000|$|His 1950, [...] "Stomp Dance" [...] was {{included}} in C. Szwedzicki's [...] "The North American Indian Works" [...] which {{is a collection of}} 364 images and six texts. Between 1929 and 1952 C. Szwedzicki, a publisher in Nice, France, produced six portfolios of North American Indian art. The publications were edited by American scholars Oscar Brousse Jacobson, Hartley Burr Alexander and Kenneth Milton Chapman. Many of the images were published as <b>pochoir</b> prints which are similar in appearance to silk screen prints. These works represent original works by 20th Century American Indian artists.|$|E
5000|$|Long-established as a printer, Devambez only {{ventured into}} book {{publishing}} {{at the start}} of the twentieth century, the first being in 1908, a book by Georges Cain on La Place Vendôme.

Books were published either simply under the name Devambez, as Devambez Éditions de Luxe, or as À l’Enseigne du Masque d’Or, Devambez the term Masque d’Or was also used for two beautiful Art Deco almanacks for the years 1921 and 1922, illustrated with <b>pochoir</b> prints by Édouard Halouze.|$|E
