5|$|Amanita gemmata is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{meaning it}} forms a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of compatible host plants. Through the association, the plant provides the fungus with a carbon source, and the fungus provides the <b>plant</b> <b>with</b> several benefits such as nutrients and protection from pathogens. Largent and collaborators (1980) document mycorrhizal associations of A.gemmata with Manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.) and Lodgepole Pine (Pinus contorta), and Nieto and Carbone with Maritime Pine (Pinus pinaster) in Spain. The fungus favours sandy and slightly acidic soils, and is often found in association with Norway Spruce (Picea abies). The mushroom grows either singly, scattered, or in groups in coniferous and mixed forests, especially along paths and roads.|$|E
5|$|Banksia brownii, {{commonly}} known as feather-leaved banksia or Brown's banksia, is a species of shrub that grows in southwest Western Australia. An attractive <b>plant</b> <b>with</b> fine feathery leaves and large red-brown flower spikes, it usually grows as an upright bush around two metres (7ft) high, but can also occur as a small tree or a low spreading shrub. First collected in 1829 and published the following year, it is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, section Oncostylis, series Spicigerae. There are two genetically distinct forms.|$|E
5|$|Banksia sessilis has a {{somewhat}} complicated taxonomic history. It was collected from King George Sound in 1801 and described by Robert Brown in 1810 as Dryandra floribunda, a name {{by which it}} was known for many years. However, Joseph Knight had published the name Josephia sessilis in 1809, which had precedence due to its earlier date, and the specific name was formalised in 1924. Four varieties are recognised. It is a prickly <b>plant</b> <b>with</b> little apparent horticultural potential, {{and none of the}} varieties are commonly seen in cultivation. A profuse producer of nectar, B.sessilis is valuable to the beekeeping industry.|$|E

5|$|Colt {{purchased}} a large {{tract of land}} beside the Connecticut River, where he built his first factory in 1848, a larger factory called the Colt Armory in 1855, a manor that he called Armsmear in 1856, and employee tenement housing.

5|$|Europe {{is home to}} {{only three}} species: D. intermedia, D. anglica, and D. rotundifolia.

The third species, D. linearis, is native to the northern United States and southern Canada.

40|$|Wheat {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{essential}} foods in the world. To increase its productivity, nutrient man-agement {{is one of the}} most important factors. To assess the possible role of micronutrients in im-proving wheat yield, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the wheat performance by foliar application of micronutrients. Treatments consist of T 1 = No spray, T 2 = Spraying <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> tube well water (control), T 3 = Spraying <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> 1. 6 kg FeSO 4 / 100 L water/acre, T 4 = Spraying <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> 3 kg ZnSO 4 (21 %) / 100 L water/acre, T 5 = Spraying <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> 1 kg MnSO 4 / 100 L wa-ter/acre, T 6 = Spraying <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> (FeSO 4 + MnSO 4), T 7 = Spraying <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> (FeSO 4 + ZnSO 4), T 8 = Spraying <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> (ZnSO 4 + MnSO 4), and T 9 = Spraying <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> (FeSO 4 + ZnSO 4 + MnSO 4).

5|$|Hippeastrum {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} Spodoptera picta (Crinum grub) as well as Pseudococcidae (Mealybugs), large, and small narcissus bulb flies (Eumerus strigatus and E funeralis), thrips, mites, aphids, snails and slugs. A fungal disease attacking Hippeastrum is Stagonospora curtisii (red blotch, red leaf spot or red fire). The leaves are also eaten by grasshoppers, and grasshoppers commonly plant egg pods in the ground near Hippeastrum bulbs, which erupt in the spring, covering the <b>plant</b> <b>with</b> nymphs.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, {{researchers}} {{studying the}} presence or absence of a dorsal stripe suggested that it has independently evolved several times in Timema species and is an adaptation for crypsis on needle-like leaves. All of the eight Timema species with a dorsal stripe have at least one host <b>plant</b> <b>with</b> needle-like foliage. Of the thirteen unstriped species, seven feed only on broadleaf plants. Four (T. ritensis, T. podura, T. genevieve, and T. coffmani) rest during the day on the host plant's trunk rather than its leaves and have bodies that are brown, gray, or tan. Only two species (T. nakipa and T. boharti) have green unstriped morphs that feed on needle-like foliage; both are generalist feeders that also feed on broadleaf hosts.|$|E
40|$|The {{causes of}} poor {{fertility}} and female infertility of Swedish clover <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> reduced leaves were investigated.

The ovaries of <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> reduced leaves are frequently not coalesced and the ovules hang out beyond the ovary on tong funiculus.

5|$|In April 1941, Matthias {{was called}} to active duty by the United States Army as a first lieutenant, and joined the Construction Division of the Army Corps of Engineers, where he {{received}} rapid promotion.

5|$|Increasing {{demand for}} boric acid has led {{a number of}} {{producers}} to invest in additional capacity. Turkey's state-owned Eti Mine Works opened a new boric acid <b>plant</b> <b>with</b> the production capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year at Emet in 2003. Rio Tinto Group increased the capacity of its boron plant from 260,000 tonnes per year in 2003 to 310,000 tonnes per year by May 2005, with plans to grow this to 366,000 tonnes per year in 2006. Chinese boron producers {{have been unable to}} meet rapidly growing demand for high quality borates. This has led to imports of sodium tetraborate (borax) growing by a hundredfold between 2000 and 2005 and boric acid imports increasing by 28% per year over the same period.|$|E
5|$|M. vitrata {{causes the}} most {{damage to the}} growing cowpea due to their large host range and {{cosmopolitan}} distribution.

5|$|Many {{species of}} bird, in {{particular}} honeyeaters, forage at the flower spikes, as do native and European honeybees. The response to bushfire varies. Some populations are serotinous: they {{are killed by}} fire and regenerate from large stores of seed which have been held in cones in the plant canopy and are released after a fire. Others regenerate from underground lignotubers or suckers from lateral roots. Although {{it has been used}} for timber, Banksia marginata is most commonly seen as a garden <b>plant,</b> <b>with</b> dwarf forms being commercially propagated and sold.|$|E
5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{although}} these {{are hard to}} obtain. Seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take around 23 days to germinate. Cuttings yield unpredictable results. The plant itself prefers a deep, sandy, well-drained soil with a pH of 6.0–7.0. It requires full sun, but some protection from the wind is recommended, as this is a fast-growing <b>plant</b> <b>with</b> spindly branches that are easily damaged by wind. A more compact form {{can be obtained by}} pruning the top quarter each year. This species has little appeal to the cut flower industry because of its prickly foliage, and its tendency to drip nectar.|$|E
