Literature highlighted that <b>plain</b> film <b>radiography</b> was an unreliable method for detecting such fractures and that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should now be regarded as the new ‘gold-standard’. Using a quantitative method, a total of 100 postal questionnaires were sent out to radiologists in 20 different imaging departments throughout the United Kingdom (UK) asking them their opinion on this controversial subject.

Of the 100 questionnaires that were sent out, a total of 45 were returned from a total of 13 different departments. The results of this investigation conclude that <b>plain</b> film <b>radiography</b> is still used as a primary imaging modality to detect scaphoid fractures in all departments. There was much support for the use of <b>plain</b> film <b>radiography</b> with the modality being praised time and time again for its ease, 24 -h availability, low cost and reproducibility. MRI was acknowledged as being superior in its capability to detect scaphoid fractures in comparison to plain films; its current use, however, is limited owing to high costs, lack of availability and long waiting lists.

40|$|This poster {{discusses}} {{technical aspects}} of {{an investigation into the}} use of non-destructive radiological analyses of pubic cancellous bone structure to estimate age-at-death from human skeletal remains. This study stems from findings, in X-ray plain films, of increased rarification and orientation of trabeculae with age [1]; likely in concert with the macroscopic remodelling of the symphyseal surface currently used in estimation of age-at-death. The study uses three non-destructive X-ray imaging modalities: <b>plain</b> film <b>radiography,</b> computed tomography (CT), and micro-CT (μCT). <b>Plain</b> film <b>radiography</b> has greater spatial resolution than CT [2] and is relatively inexpensive, widely available, and, with portable X-ray units, even accessible in the field for archaeological and forensic applications. CT scanners are largely restricted to clinical settings due to the size, sensitivity, and cost of the machine, but offer a greater contrast resolution than <b>plain</b> film <b>radiography</b> [2]. More expensive and more precise, μCTscanners are further restricted in their availability and accessibility, but CT andμCTmodalities provide volumetric data, avoiding the confusion of overlying cortical and cancellous structures and the apparent increases in density with element thickness seen in <b>plain</b> film <b>radiography...</b>|$|R

The findings usually appear as small, irregular parenchymal opacities, primarily in the lung bases. Using the ILO Classification system, [...] "s", [...] "t", and/or [...] "u" [...] opacities predominate.

2500|$|Today {{a growing}} body of {{scientific}} evidence indicate that this disease process, in the cancellous bone and bone marrow, is caused by bone infarcts mediated by a range of local and systemic factors. Bone infarcts as well as damage to the deeper portion of the cancellous bone is an insidious process. It is certainly not visible clinically and routine imaging techniques such as radiographs are not effective for that sort of damage. [...] "An important and often incompletely understood principle of radiography is the amount of bone destruction that goes undetected by routine x-rays procedures; this has been demonstrated by numerous investigators. Destruction confined to the cancellous portion of the bone cannot be detected radiographically, as radiolucencies appear only when there is internal or external erosion or destruction of the bone cortex." [...] In fact no radiographic findings are specific for bone infarction / osteonecrosis. A variety of pathologies may mimic bone infarction, including stress fractures, infections, inflammations, and metabolic and neoplastic processes. The limitations apply to all imaging modalities, including <b>plain</b> <b>radiography,</b> radionuclide studies, CT scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Through-transmission alveolar ultrasound, based on quantitative ultrasound (QUS) in combination with panoramic dental radiography (orthopantomography) is helpful in assessing changes in jawbone density. When practitioners have an up-to-date understanding of the disease process and a good anamnesis is combined with detailed clinical findings and course of events, the diagnosis, with the help of various imaging modality, can be achieved earlier, in most patients.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{main goal}} of the {{treatment}} is the anatomical reduction of the ulna fracture and the radial head dislocation in acute and chronic Monteggia cases. Acute pediatric Monteggia lesions are generally treated non-surgically; however, the treatment of chronic Monteggia is challenging. The aim {{of this article is}} to share our experiences about treatment of neglected Monteggia lesion. Presentation of case: A 6 -year-old girl who underwent a surgery in our clinic for a missed Bado type-III Monteggia fracture-dislocation of the right elbow with concomitant posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) palsy, which resolved spontaneously after the operation. The operation consisted of open reduction of the radial head, transverse ulnar osteotomy and fixation with an intramedullary Kirchner wire, and annular ligament repair without exploring PIN. The patient was seen in routine follow-up periods until the postoperative first year using <b>plain</b> <b>radiographies.</b> At 16 th week follow-up, all functions of the PIN were returned. At first-year follow-up, full range of elbow motion was observed; <b>plain</b> <b>radiographies</b> showed radiocapitellar joint congruency, and Mayo Elbow Performance Index was one hundred. Discussion: Treatment planning for chronic, neglected or missed Monteggia fractures is challenging. There is no consensus about the definitive treatment in the literature. Conclusion: We recommend anatomic and stable restoration of radiocapitellar joint by correcting ulna deformity. Radiocapitellar fixation and PIN exploration may not be necessary in all neglected Monteggia lesions...|$|R

40|$|Background: Necrotizing {{enterocolitis}} (NEC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious disorders of gastrointestinal tract during neonatal period. Early diagnosis and adequate treatment are essential in the presence of clinical suspicion of NEC. <b>Plain</b> abdominal <b>radiography</b> is currently the modality of choice for initial evaluation of gastrointestinal tract in neonates. However, when the diagnosis is uncertain, abdominal ultrasound with bowel assessment might be an important complementary examination. The aim of the study was to evaluate usefulness of ultrasound in the diagnosis of NEC and its value for implementation of proper treatment. Material and Methods: The data of nine neonates diagnosed with NEC, hospitalized at the Provincial Hospital No. 2 in Rzeszow in the period from September 2009 to April 2013 was retrospectively analyzed. Apart from abdominal radiography, abdominal ultrasound with bowel assessment was performed in all nine cases. Imaging findings, epidemiological data, coexisting risk factors and disease course were assessed. Results: Most children in the group were preterm neonates. Findings in <b>plain</b> abdominal <b>radiography</b> were normal or nonspecific. A wider spectrum of findings was demonstrated in all ultrasound examinations and intestinal pneumatosis, a pathognomonic sign for NEC, was more frequently noted than in plain abdominal x-ray. Most children were treated by surgical intervention with resection of necrotic bowel loops and in more than half of the cases location of changes identified during surgery was concordant with ultrasonographic findings. Conclusions: Abdominal ultrasound examination might be helpful in the diagnosis of NEC, especially when <b>plain</b> abdominal <b>radiography</b> findings do not correlate with clinical symptoms. However, abdominal radiography is still considered the modality of choice. The range of morphological changes detectable on ultrasound examination is much wider than in <b>plain</b> abdominal <b>radiography.</b> Ultrasound examination allows for more accurate assessment of changes within intestines and adjacent tissues, which aids clinicians in making more accurate therapeutic decisions and implementing proper treatment...|$|R
