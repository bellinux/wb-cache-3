5|$|Although sea lochs are the boobries' natural {{home they}} will shelter on land in {{overgrown}} heather. Accounts are inconsistent {{as to the}} extent of the boobrie's habitat. Campbell of Islay claims that it is specific to the lochs of Argyllshire, as does Emeritus <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> James MacKillop. The writers Katharine Briggs and Patricia Monaghan on the other hand consider the creature's range to be the broader Scottish Highlands, although Briggs does sometimes specify Argyllshire. Campbell of Islay's undated manuscript notes the boobrie had not been seen for several years probably due to the widespread burning of heather in the area of its habitat.|$|E

He was at one time {{a close friend of}} C.S.Lewis—they were both members of the {{informal}} literary discussion group known as the Inklings. Tolkien was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972.|$|E

5|$|In 1945, Tolkien {{moved to}} Merton College, Oxford, {{becoming}} the Merton <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> Language and Literature, in which post he remained {{until his retirement}} in 1959. He served as an external examiner for University College, Dublin, for many years. In 1954 Tolkien received an honorary degree from the National University of Ireland (of which U.C.D. was a constituent college). Tolkien completed The Lord of the Rings in 1948, close to a decade after the first sketches.|$|E

In 1974, he was Visiting Professor of Comparative Literature at Harvard; during the 1975–76 period, he was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Science, at Stanford University. In 1977, he became the Parr <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, and {{subsequently}} was the Old Dominion Foundation Professor in the Humanities; and in 1979 was Visiting Professor of Humanities at Johns Hopkins University.|$|E

Two of their sons followed in their father's footsteps, earning doctorates and becoming university professors: James H.

5|$|In {{her book}} {{column for the}} Detroit Free Press, Marta Salij said that Cal's {{identity}} crisis resembles Odysseus's fate. Whereas the mythical hero is troubled by Poseidon and succored by Athena, the intersex protagonist is affected by his chromosomes in a similar manner. John Sykes, <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> and religion education, noted another Greek-hero reference. In {{a manner similar to}} Oedipus's fulfillment of Pythia's prophecy to slay his father and marry his mother, Callie validates the prediction her grandmother made before her birth by adopting a male identity. Eugenides also used the allusions to Greek mythology and modern pop music to show the passing of familial traits and idiosyncrasies {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E
5|$|M. Daphne Kutzer, <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code (2003), detects some {{similarities}} to The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin (1903). Both tales have touches of the pourquoi story in their explanations of why squirrels collect nuts, and both incorporate rhymes and riddles in their narratives. However, there is a crucial difference that diminishes the artistry of Timmy Tiptoes: the rhymes and riddles in Squirrel Nutkin shed light on Nutkin's character and create a guessing game for the reader while those in Timmy Tiptoes are bland devices that simply move the characters to reunions with their wives and the tale to its conclusion.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} blue plaques in England that commemorate places {{associated}} with Tolkien: one in Oxford, one in Bournemouth, four in Birmingham {{and one in}} Leeds. One of the Birmingham plaques commemorates the inspiration provided by Sarehole Mill, near which he lived {{between the ages of}} four and eight, while two mark childhood homes up to the time he left to attend Oxford University and the other marks a hotel he stayed at before leaving for France during World War I. The plaque in West Park, Leeds, commemorates the five years Tolkien enjoyed at Leeds as Reader and then <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> Language at the University. The Oxford plaque commemorates the residence where Tolkien wrote The Hobbit and most of The Lord of the Rings.|$|E

His father, Ray West, is a former Black Panther {{and was one of the}} first black photojournalists at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Ray West was later a Christian counselor, and in 2006, opened the Good Water Store and Café in Lexington Park, Maryland with startup capital from his son. West's mother, Dr. Donda C. (Williams) West, was a <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> at Clark Atlanta University, and the Chair of the English Department at Chicago State University before retiring to serve as his manager. West was raised in a middle-class background, attending Polaris High School in suburban Oak Lawn, Illinois after living in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Sommerstein {{attempts}} {{a reconstruction}} of {{the plot of the}} Troilos, in which the title character is incestuously in love with Polyxena and tries to discourage the interest in marrying her shown by both Achilles and Sarpedon, a Trojan ally and son of Zeus. Sommerstein argues that Troilus is accompanied on his fateful journey to his death, not by Polyxena, but by his tutor, a eunuch Greek slave. Certainly there is a speaking role for a eunuch who reports being castrated by Hecuba and someone reports the loss of their adolescent master. The incestuous love is deduced by Sommerstein from a fragment of Strattis' parody, assumed to partially quote Sophocles, and from his understanding that the Sophocles play intends to contrast barbarian customs, including incest, with Greek ones. Sommerstein also sees this as solving what he considers the need for an explanation of Achilles' treatment of Troilus' corpse, the latter being assumed to have insulted Achilles in the process of warning him off Polyxena. Italian <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> and expert on Troilus, Piero Boitani, on the other hand, considers Troilus' rejection of Achilles' sexual advances towards him as sufficient motive for the mutilation.|$|E
