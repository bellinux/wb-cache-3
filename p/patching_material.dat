40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with patch {{angioplasty}} produces greater results {{than with}} primary closure; however, there remains uncertainty on the optimal <b>patch</b> <b>material</b> in CEA. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) {{was performed to}} evaluate the effect of angioplasty using venous patch versus synthetic <b>patch</b> <b>material,</b> and Dacron <b>patch</b> versus polytetrafluoroethelene (PTFE) <b>patch</b> <b>material</b> during CEA. METHODS: A multiple electronic health database screening was performed including the Cochrane library, Pubmed, Ovid, EMBASE and Google Scholar on all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published before November 2012 that compared the outcomes of patients undergoing CEA with venous patch versus synthetic patch. RCTs were included if they compared carotid patch angioplasty with autologus venous patch versus synthetic <b>patch</b> <b>material,</b> or compared one type of synthetic patch with another. RESULTS: Thirteen RCTs were identified. Ten trials, involving 1946 CEAs, compared venous patch with synthetic <b>patch</b> <b>materials.</b> Two trials, involving 400 CEAs in 380 patients, compared Dacron patch with PTFE patch. The hemostasis time in CEA with PTFE patch was significantly longer than with venous patch (P 0. 05). One RCT of 95 CEAs in 92 patients compared bovine pericardium with Dacron patch, and demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in intraoperative suture line bleeding with bovine pericardium compared with Dacron patch (P< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The hemostasis time in CEA with PTFE patch was longer than with venous patch or Dacron patch. The overall perioperative and long-term mortality rate, stroke rate, restenosis, and operative time were similar when using venous patch versus synthetic <b>patch</b> <b>material</b> or Dacron <b>patch</b> versus PTFE <b>patch</b> <b>material</b> during CEA.

40|$|Patch {{angioplasty}} is {{the most}} common technique used for the performance of carotid endarterectomy. A large number of <b>patching</b> <b>materials</b> are available for use while new materials are being continuously developed. Surprisingly {{little is known about the}} mechanical properties of these materials and how these properties compare with those of the carotid artery wall. Mismatch of the mechanical properties can produce mechanical and hemodynamic effects that may compromise the long-term patency of the endarterectomized arterial segment. The aim of this paper was to systematically evaluate and compare the biaxial mechanical behavior of the most commonly used <b>patching</b> <b>materials.</b> We compared PTFE (n¼ 1), Dacron (n¼ 2), bovine pericardium (n¼ 10), autogenous greater saphenous vein (n¼ 10), and autogenous external jugular vein (n¼ 9) with the wall of the common carotid artery (n¼ 18). All <b>patching</b> <b>materials</b> were found to be significantly stiffer than the carotid wall in both the longitudinal and circumferential directions. Synthetic patches demonstrated the most mismatch in stiffness values and vein patches the least mismatch in stiffness values compared to those of the native carotid artery. All biological materials, including the carotid artery, demonstrated substantial nonlinearity, anisotropy, and variability; however, the behavior of biological and biologically-derived patches was both qualitatively and quantitatively different from the behavior of the carotid wall. The majority of carotid arteries tested were stiffer in the circumferential direction, while the opposite anisotropy was observed for all types of vein patches and bovine pericardium. The rates of increase in the nonlinear stiffness over the physiological stress range were also different for the carotid and <b>patching</b> <b>materials.</b> Several carotid wall samples exhibited reverse anisotropy compared to the average behavior of the carotid tissue. A similar characteristic was observed for two of 19 vein patches. The obtained results quantify, for the first time, significant mechanical dissimilarity of the currently available <b>patching</b> <b>materials</b> and the carotid artery. The results can be used as guidance for designing more efficient patches with mechanical properties resembling those of the carotid wall. The presented systematic comparative mechanical analysis of the existing <b>patching</b> <b>materials</b> provides valuable information for patch selection in the daily practice of carotid surgery and can be used in future clinical studies comparing the efficacy of different patches in the performance of carotid endarterectomy...|$|R

The test sections were constructed in September of 1994 to evaluate retrofit load transfer {{and the effects}} of different dowel lengths and configurations, and patching materials on performance. The slots that the dowels were installed in were created by parallel saw cuts and a jackhammer to remove the concrete. The back fill materials evaluated consisted of a proprietary rapid setting <b>patching</b> <b>material</b> and Mn/DOT’s standard cement based patching mix. Dowel bar configurations evaluated included dowels in the outside wheel paths of the right lane only, right and left wheel paths of the right lane only and different configurations in both the left and right lanes.

The basis for this high incidence of infection is not well established, so a murine intravascular infection model was developed with aortic implantation of the textured polyurethane <b>patch</b> <b>material</b> currently used in HeartMate ventricular assist devices (Thoratec Corporation Pleasanton, Calif). MethodsPolyurethane <b>patch</b> <b>material</b> was placed in the wall of the mouse descending aorta. Mice were then infected with Staphylococcus aureus 1 or 14 days after implantation. In vitro adhesion studies were conducted with polyurethane membranes coated with endothelial cells and membranes coated with fibrinogen. ResultsMice were susceptible to infection in both dose- and time-dependent fashions. The <b>patch</b> <b>material</b> was significantly more susceptible to infection at day 1 than day 14. Immunohistologic and morphologic studies demonstrated that the CD 31 + cells deposited on the membrane surface phenotypically appeared to be endothelial cells. In vitro adhesion studies of polyurethane membranes coated with endothelial cells showed them to be less susceptible to S aureus binding than were membranes coated with fibrinogen. ConclusionTextured polyurethane membranes are less susceptible to infection as cellular deposition occurs. The time frame within which these membranes become populated with cellular material is consistent with the time-dependent clinical incidence of infection.

It forms part of an ongoing research programme towards improving the performance of pothole repairs. Thermal imaging technology was used to record temperatures of the <b>patching</b> <b>material</b> throughout the entire exercise, from the stage of material collection, through transportation to repair site, patch forming, and compaction. Practical complications occurring during patch repairs were also identified.

This impacting is on the durability and performance of the executed repairs. Cold spots on the asphalt mat and temperature differentials between the new hot-fill asphalt mix and existing pavement were also identified as poorly compacted areas that were prone to premature failure. For example, over the five-minute period, the temperature at one point reduced by 33 % whereas the temperatures of nearby areas decreased by 65 % and 71 %.

A total of 28 test sections with various load transfer devices were placed. The devices include split pipe, figure eight, vee, double vee, and dowel bars. Patching materials used on the project included three types of fast-setting grouts, three brands of polymer concrete, and plain portland cement concrete.
