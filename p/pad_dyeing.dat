40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of studies into the effectiveness of biodegradable alkaline organic salts as alternatives to traditional nonbiodegradable inorganic electrolytes and alkalis used in pad-steam dyeing of cotton with reactive dyes. The primary objective {{of the study was to}} develop improved environmentally sustainable dyeing systems. A difluorochloropyrimidine and a bis(sulphatoethylsulphone) dye were used in this study. After early encouraging results using alkaline polycarboxylic sodium salts, it became clear that current literature and dyeing theories on the role of the electrolyte cations and anions needed further explanation for <b>pad</b> <b>dyeing</b> methods. Accordingly, studies were carried out on a range of electrolytes of different cations and anions. These studies have resulted in a new theory for dyeing of cotton with anionic dyes using electrolytes. Traditionally, industry and dye research laboratories have determined the optimum concentration for an electrolyte, in grams per litre, via laboratory tests. This research has shown that for a given cation the required concentration of an alternative electrolyte can be determined by its ionic strength, i. e. µ = ½ ∑ [molar concentration of the salt x (ionic charge) 2]. In other words, having determined the optimum concentration for, say, sodium chloride, the optimum concentration of any other sodium salt is the concentration required to give the same ionic strength. These findings also lead to an improved understanding of the use of electrolytes. The driving force for dye diffusion and also dye exhaustion (exhaust dyeings) is the dyebath ionic strength; i. e. it is independent of the type of electrolyte and alkali. In <b>pad</b> <b>dyeing</b> of cotton, dye fixation and ultimate colour yield significantly depend on the dye diffusion and the subsequent uniformity of distribution of dye molecules throughout the fibre. A hypothesis for a new and simple method of determining the extent of dye diffusion in <b>pad</b> <b>dyeing</b> of cotton with reactive dyes was proven. The new method is based on reflectance measurements for quantifying the dye diffusion. The new theory on the role of electrolyte cations and anions and the new method for determining the extent of dye diffusion were then used in the study on a range of biodegradable alkaline organic salts as alternatives to traditional nonbiodegradable inorganic electrolytes and alkalis for pad-steam of dyeing of cotton with reactive dyes. The research presents results where any of the three biodegradable alkaline polycarboxylic sodium salts, tetrasodium ethylene diamine tetra-acetate, trisodium nitrilo triacetate and tetrasodium N,N-bis(carboxylatomethyl) -L-glutamate can be used as alternatives to traditionally used inorganic electrolyte and alkali in the pad liquor. The optimum concentrations of the organic salts were determined for dye diffusion, dye fixation and colour yield. The dye fixation, colour yield and ultimate colourfastness achieved by using alkaline polycarboxylic salts were closely comparable to those obtained by using inorganic electrolyte and alkali. More interestingly, the dyeing effluent showed considerable reductions in total dissolved solids content with the organic salts. In order to examine the applicability of the alkaline polycarboxylic salt, an industrial trial was carried out using sodium edate which gave similar encouraging results...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze and compare the color strengths of mercerized and unmercerized fabric among different fabric structures. In this research work Remazol reactive dye and three types of woven fabrics were used such as 20 ⁎ 20 sheeting, 30 ⁎ 30 sheeting, and herringbone. Spectrophotometer was used to find out the amount of dye which is fixed in the fabrics after soap wash. Three different woven fabrics were dyed with reactive dye (Remazol Red, Remazol Yellow, and Remazol Blue) using <b>pad</b> <b>dyeing</b> method. It was found that mercerized fabric had higher depth of shade under the same dye concentration. In case of shade A (0. 5 %) 20 ⁎ 20 sheeting showed better color strength compared to other two structures but for shade B (1. 5 %) and shade C (4 %) herringbone fabric showed better dye absorptive capacity than 20 ⁎ 20 sheeting...|$|E
40|$|Reactive dye {{fixation}} {{to color}} yield of dyed cellulosic fibre significantly {{depend on the}} dye diffusion extent into the fibre polymer matrix. In case of pad-dyeing process dye diffusion exerts more significant influence on dye fixation, consequently color yield takes place. Dye selection concepts based on performance tests requires tedious experimental work which remains always very difficult in continuous processes. In order to overcome this problem, this research work will provide an appropriate platform to understand and optimize the diffusion coefficient which plays important role in best trichromy selection by converting visual performance tests into data. The dye diffusion extent of reactive dyes into the fibre in <b>pad</b> <b>dyeing</b> using Kubelka-Munk equation is the correct for optimization and judicious dye selection. Dye diffusion index influences the dye fixation, ultimate color yield to color fastness of dyed fibre to digital color values. Various characterization techniques like affinity of different dyes by capillary test method, diffusion extent of individual dye by kubelka- munk equation method, drop test of individual dye its conversion into data form and dry migration of these dyes using disc method are used in this study...|$|E

40|$|The novel {{conditioner}} {{was developed}} for uniform conditioning across a pad. The conditioner is composed by bendable fibers. Therefore, each abrasive conforms independently to the pad surface, differently from the traditional conditioner of plate type. The removal rate using the developed conditioner is equal to that using the traditional conditioner. However, the cut rate of pad using the developed one is tenth part of the cut rate using traditional one. Therefore, it was demonstrated that the developed conditioner realized more efficient conditioning. In addition, in order to evaluate the conditioning non-uniformity effectively, novel uniformity evaluation method was developed. The principle uses color variation by abrading the <b>pad</b> <b>dyed</b> on the surface. As the result, the conditioning non-uniformity was 8. 3 % with the developed conditioner, compared with 23. 8 % with the traditional conditioner...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the findings from}} investigations into adapting the <b>padding</b> process for <b>dyeing</b> cotton and wool using natural dyes. The aim was to apply traditional dyes employing current and emerging technologies of textile colouration. This synergistic amalgamation led to a cleaner production process with low environmental impact. Mordant dyes (derived from Acacia catechu and Acacia nilotica) and vat dyes (Indigofera tinctoria) were evaluated. The work on mordant dyes focused on determining optimal process parameters (padding sequence, mordanting method and mordant concentration). Post-mordanting with copper (II) sulfate or iron (II) sulphate yielded the darkest shades for both dyes. Ideal process sequence for copper (II) sulfate was <b>pad</b> (<b>dye)</b> → dry → steam followed by pad (mordant) → steam → dry while for iron (II) sulfate it was <b>pad</b> (<b>dye)</b> → steam → dry followed by pad (mordant) → steam → dry for both dyes. Similarly, use of the first mordant yielded a beige shade while a yellow-grey shade was obtained with the second. Optimum mordant concentration for 10 g/l dye was 15 g/l copper (II) sulfate or 5 g/l iron (II) sulphate for both dyes. These were lower than those recommended for exhaust dyeing (5 % OWM) and padding (60 g/l) reported in the literature. Atomic absorption spectroscopy revealed higher amount of metal in the dyed fabric compared to identically mordanted fabric, confirming {{the formation of a}} dye-metal-textile complex. FTIR spectra were distinctly different for the two dyes investigated. However, the spectra for dyed samples, coloured using the above dyes in combination with the same mordant, exhibited minimal differences. This indicated that metal {{plays a major role in}} defining the bonds created during dye-metal-textile complex formation causing a similarity in shade. Darker shades were obtained by atmospheric pressure plasma pretreatment of the textile, or including chitosan in the pad liquor. Pure helium and a 95 / 5 helium/nitrogen mixture were evaluated as the plasma gas. Exposure to either plasma improved the wettability of wool. Wool treated in pure helium plasma for 14 seconds exhibited a 30 % increase in the depth of shade. A tone-on-tone pattern was created in a single padding operation by selective plasma pretreatment. Incorporation of 0. 05 % chitosan in the pad liquor resulted in a 20 % darker shade while imparting antimicrobial properties to the dyed fabric. Indigo was applied on cotton by the vat <b>dyeing</b> process of <b>pad</b> (<b>dye)</b> → dry → pad (reducing chemicals) → steam. In this process, sodium dithionite and sodium hydroxide, the common reducing agent and alkali in exhaust dyeing of indigo, were replaced by thiourea dioxide and sodium carbonate respectively. Although equivalent shades were obtained, the use of sodium carbonate required comparatively longer steaming time. Natural indigo produced a darker shade when reduced using the alternative chemicals perhaps due to its higher reactivity resulting from its lower crystallinity as compared to synthetic indigo. However, printing with synthetic indigo resulted in darker shades. The discrepancy between printing and dyeing may be attributed to interference by the print paste thickener on diffusion of reduced indigo into the fabric...|$|R

60|$|The ink used may {{be either}} printer's ink or water colour, but for {{producing}} the best work, rapidly {{and on a}} large scale, the method of printer's ink seems in every respect preferable. However, water colour suffices for some purposes, and as {{there is so much}} convenience in a <b>pad,</b> drenched with <b>dye,</b> such as is commonly used for hand stamps, and which is always ready for use, many may prefer it.

This paper describes the chemical resist printing of polyester fabrics <b>padded</b> with disperse <b>dyes</b> {{to create a}} white image on a coloured background. Polyester grounds have been prepared by the pad-dry ‘dyeing’ of polyester fabrics with alkali clearable disperse dyes, such as a Dianix PC (DyStar) or a Dianix SF (DyStar) dye, and subsequently ink-jet printed with sodium carbonate based ink formulations to yield a white image on a solid ground following high temperature steaming and appropriate wash-off procedures. Coloured images have been achieved by a two-step process whereby the coloured ground fabric was initially printed with an alkali based ink and then over-printed in a second step with an illuminating ink formulation containing a alkali stable disperse dye, such as a Dianix AD (DyStar) or Serilene ADS (Yorkshire Chemicals) ...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that photo-activated disinfection (PAD) has a bactericidal effect on pathogens inoculated in root canals, with emphasis on biofilm formation/destruction. METHODOLOGY: Root canals of extracted teeth (n = 38) were prepared (size 30, 0. 10 taper), autoclaved, divided into three groups and two negative controls inoculated (Streptococcus anginosus, Enterococcus faecalis or Fusobacterium nucleatum) and treated (<b>PAD,</b> laser, <b>dye</b> or positive control) according to a cross-sectional design. Resultant colony-forming unit counts were associated with observations of cell structural changes using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) on inoculated dentinal surfaces (n = 22, two controls) before (1, 2 and 6 days of incubation) and after treatment with PAD. RESULTS: Treatment of root canals with PAD (15 J) caused a significant reduction of the bacterial load, resulting in a 93. 8 % kill of S. anginosus (P < 0. 0001), a 88. 4 % kill of E. faecalis (P < 0. 05) and a 98. 5 % kill of F. nucleatum (P < 0. 0001), but no sterilization. Laser alone had no {{significant effect on the}} load nor did the dye without laser. The ESEM experiment showed that individual cells or monolayers were easily eliminated with PAD. But when biofilms were present (2 and 6 days for E. faecalis, 6 days for S. anginosus), bacterial eradication was substantially reduced in deep layers. CONCLUSIONS: Photo-activated disinfection is not an alternative but a possible supplement to the existing protocols for root canal disinfection as the interaction between light (diode laser) and associated dye (TBO) provides a broad-spectrum effect. Some endodontic pathogens that grow as single-species biofilms, however, are difficult to eradicate. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review was to inform all medical health care {{professionals}} about cuboid syndrome, which {{has been described as}} difficult to recognize and is commonly misdiagnosed, by explaining the etiology of this syndrome, its clinical diagnosis in relation to differential diagnoses, commonly administered treatment techniques, and patient outcomes. A comprehensive review of the relevant literature was conducted with MEDLINE, EBSCO, and PubMed (1960 - Present) using the key words cuboid, cuboid syndrome, foot anatomy, tarsal bones, manual therapy, and manipulation. Medical professionals must be aware that any lateral foot and ankle pain {{may be the result of}} cuboid syndrome. Once properly diagnosed, cuboid syndrome responds exceptionally well to conservative treatment involving specific cuboid manipulation techniques. Other methods of conservative treatment including therapeutic modalities, therapeutic exercises, <b>padding,</b> and low <b>dye</b> taping techniques are used as adjuncts in the treatment of this syndrome. Immediately after the manipulation is performed, the patient may note a decrease or a complete cessation of their symptoms. Occasionally, if the patient has had symptoms for a longer duration, several manipulations may be warranted throughout the course of time. Due to the fact radiographic imaging is of little value, the diagnosis is largely based on the patient's history and a collection of signs and symptoms associated with the condition. Additionally, an understanding of the etiology behind this syndrome is essential, aiding the clinician in the diagnosis and treatment of this syndrome. After the correct diagnosis is made and a proper treatment regimen is utilized, the prognosis is excellen...|$|R
