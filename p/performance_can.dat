5|$|A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is {{a passive}} solar {{ventilation}} system {{composed of a}} vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building. <b>Performance</b> <b>can</b> be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials {{in a way that}} mimics greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|On April 5, 2016, Attorney General of Alabama Luther Strange {{ruled that}} DFS was illegal under state law, and sent {{cease and desist}} notices to DraftKings and FanDuel {{ordering}} them to stop serving residents of Alabama by May 1, 2016. He argued that while picking players for a fantasy team is an activity of skill, player <b>performance</b> <b>can</b> vary, and Alabama law dictates that {{it is illegal to}} risk something of value on any game with an element of chance.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, {{powerful}} motorcycles {{can generate}} enough torque {{at the rear}} wheel to lift the front wheel off {{the ground in a}} maneuver called a wheelie. A line similar to the one described above to analyze braking <b>performance</b> <b>can</b> be drawn from the rear wheel contact patch to predict if a wheelie is possible given the available friction, the center of mass location, and sufficient power. This can also happen on bicycles, although there is much less power available, if the center of mass is back or up far enough or the rider lurches back when applying power to the pedals.|$|E
5|$|Enemies, {{encountered}} in environments as icons, react differently {{depending on how}} they are approached and attacked: using the right attack or approaching them unawares grants the party an advantage in battle. If other groups of enemies are close by, they are also drawn into the initiated battle. For both player characters and enemies, battle skills and character <b>performance</b> <b>can</b> be affected by elemental attributes. Status ailments can also be inflicted by both the party and enemies. They are divided into physical ailments and magical ailments, which {{have a variety of}} negative effects: physical effects can be effects like slowing or poisoning a character, while magical ailments can cause units to turn on their allies or automatically recover a knocked-out party member. Items used on characters can restore TP or HP, or remove status ailments. Characters learn new skills during battles, along with Titles that affect aspects of characters.|$|E
25|$|The optimization, {{sometimes}} performed automatically by an optimizing compiler, is {{to select}} a method (algorithm) that is more computationally efficient, while retaining the same functionality.

25|$|The South Central Coast's sector 1 (agriculture, forestry, fishing) <b>performance</b> <b>can</b> {{be seen as}} {{average in}} the {{national}} context, with its GDP contribution similar to its population share (9.7% and 9.5%). Rice output is below average, but output of some other crops (see table below) as well as forestry and fishing are above average.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol fuel: Some alcohols, mainly ethanol and methanol, {{can be used}} as fuel. Fuel <b>performance</b> <b>can</b> be {{increased}} in forced induction internal combustion engines by injecting alcohol into the air intake after the turbocharger or supercharger has pressurized the air. This cools the pressurized air, providing a denser air charge, which allows for more fuel, and therefore more power.|$|E
25|$|Axial compressors, {{particularly}} near {{design conditions}} are, on the whole, amenable to analytical treatment, and usually a good estimate of their <b>performance</b> <b>can</b> be made {{before they are}} run. Away from the design points, the performances are conveniently thought of {{in terms of the}} overall characteristics of pressure-rises, temperature-rises, and efficiencies plotted against mass-flows.|$|E

25|$|For efficiency, heat {{exchangers}} {{are designed to}} maximize the surface area of the wall between the two fluids, while minimizing resistance to fluid flow through the exchanger. The exchanger's <b>performance</b> <b>can</b> also {{be affected by the}} addition of fins or corrugations in one or both directions, which increase surface area and may channel fluid flow or induce turbulence.|$|E
25|$|With a {{handicap}} factor of 100, {{according to the}} 2008 handicap list of the Deutscher Aero Club e.V., the SZD-59 in 15m-configuration is a typical Club Class glider. With 15m wing-tips with or without winglets glide <b>performance</b> <b>can</b> be enhanced by increasing its wing loading with up to 150 litres of water ballast, but water ballast is not allowed in the 13.2m configuration.|$|E
25|$|The in-core {{ceilings}} are roofline-like curve {{beneath the}} actual roofline {{that may be}} present {{due to the lack}} of some form of parallelism. These ceilings effectively limit how high <b>performance</b> <b>can</b> reach. Performance cannot exceed an in-core ceiling until the underlying lack of parallelism is expressed and exploited. The ceilings can be also derived from architectural optimization manuals other than benchmarks.|$|E

25|$|Rambler's {{emphasis}} on economy over <b>performance</b> <b>can</b> be observed through {{the example of}} automatic transmission use in a Rambler American where the 1959 owner's handbook describes leaving the gear selector in the D-2 position (1.47:1 gear ratio) blocks access to low gear (2.40 ratio) when starting out from a stop; therefore, given the car's 3.31 axle, this yields an initial 4.86:1 final drive ratio reducing crankshaft revolutions for maximum fuel economy.|$|E
25|$|Compared to {{estimating}} performance {{which is}} very cost effective (thus useful in design), testing, while costly, {{is still the most}} precise method. Further, testing centrifugal compressor performance is very complex. Professional societies such as ASME (i.e. PTC–10, Fluid Meters Handbook, PTC-19.x), ASHRAE (ASHRAE Handbook) and API (ANSI/API 617-2002, 672-2007) have established standards for detailed experimental methods and analysis of test results. Despite this complexity, a few basic concepts in <b>performance</b> <b>can</b> be presented by examining an example test performance map.|$|E
25|$|Designing and tuning a PID {{controller}} {{appears to}} be conceptually intuitive, but can be hard in practice, if multiple (and often conflicting) objectives such as short transient and high stability are to be achieved. PID controllers often provide acceptable control using default tunings, but <b>performance</b> <b>can</b> generally be improved by careful tuning, and performance may be unacceptable with poor tuning. Usually, initial designs need to be adjusted repeatedly through computer simulations until the closed-loop system performs or compromises as desired.|$|E

25|$|The pure {{dance is}} called a nritta, while the {{expressive}} dance {{is called a}} nritya. A Kathak <b>performance</b> <b>can</b> be solo, duo or team. In a technical performance, the speed and energy the dancers exchange with the audience increases in multiples, that is the tempo doubles or quadruples. During the performance, {{one or more of}} the Kathak artists may come to the microphone, interact with the audience, explain something, tell an anecdote in a particular language, or rhythmically recite a song.|$|E
25|$|The KdV {{equation}} can {{be derived}} from the Boussinesq equations, but additional assumptions are needed to be able to split off the forward wave propagation. For practical applications, the Benjamin–Bona–Mahony equation (BBM equation) is preferable over the KdV equation, a forward-propagating model similar to KdV but with much better frequency-dispersion behaviour at shorter wavelengths. Further improvements in short-wave <b>performance</b> <b>can</b> be obtained by starting to derive a one-way wave equation from a modern improved Boussinesq model, valid for even shorter wavelengths.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{adding more}} memory {{can help to}} make a program run faster. For example, a {{filtering}} program will commonly read each line and filter and output that line immediately. This only uses enough memory for one line, but performance is typically poor, due to the latency of each disk read. <b>Performance</b> <b>can</b> be greatly improved by reading the entire file then writing the filtered result, though this uses much more memory. Caching the result is similarly effective, though also requiring larger memory use.|$|E
