40|$|This chapter reviews {{some common}} <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> for {{business}} processes, and presents process structures which can generate these <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior.</b> Many interesting <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> are caused, {{at least in}} part, by feedback, which is the phenomenon where changes {{in the value of}} a variable indirectly in ® uence future values of that same variable. Causal loop diagrams (Richardson and Pugh 1981, Senge 1990) are a way of graphically representing feedback structures in a business process with which some readers may be familiar. However, causal loop diagrams only suggest the possible modes <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> for a process. By developing a stock and ® ow diagram and corresponding model equations, it is possible to estimate the actual behavior for the process. Figure 4. 1 illustrates four <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> for process variables. These are often seen individually or in combination in a process, and therefore it is useful to understand the types of process structures that typically lead to each pattern. 4. 1 Exponential Growt...|$|R

25|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that sexual violence is also a learnt behavior in some adults, particularly as regards child sexual abuse. Studies on sexually abused boys have shown that around one in five continue in later life to molest children themselves. Such experiences may lead to a <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> where the man regularly justifies being violent, denies doing wrong, and has false and unhealthy notions about sexuality.|$|E
25|$|Experiments {{have shown}} that {{asynchronous}} hatching may also reduce sibling rivalry. Experimentally manipulated synchronous broods produced more aggressive chicks; chicks in asynchronous broods were less violent. This <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> arguably occurs through a clearly established brood hierarchy in asynchronously hatched siblings. Although asynchronous hatching is not vital {{for the formation of}} brood hierarchies (the experimentally synchronous broods established them as well), it does aid in efficient brood reduction when food levels are low. Subordinate chicks in asynchronous broods die more quickly, thus relieving the parents of the burden of feeding both offspring when resources are insufficient to properly do so.|$|E

25|$|Much {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} the personality of Christopher Porco. Police contended that his <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> is consistent with a diagnosis of psychopathy or sociopathy, two similar though not identical disorders characterized by traits such as egomania, pathological deception, scamming and defrauding others, and lack of conscience or remorse. For example, Porco lied to obtain both a car and tuition payments. Michele McKay, a law clerk who worked with Peter Porco, said he had described his youngest son as a sociopath. Several Albany-area psychologists and mental health professors have stated to the Times Union that Porco's behavior was consistent with that of a sociopath. In particular, they focused on a consistent pattern of lies Porco told to convince acquaintances that he was from a wealthy and influential family.|$|E
25|$|Domestic {{violence}} (also named domestic abuse, battering, {{or family}} violence) is a <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> which involves violence or other abuse by one person against {{another in a}} domestic setting, such as in marriage or cohabitation. It may be termed intimate partner violence when committed by a spouse or partner in an intimate relationship against the other spouse or partner, and can take place in heterosexual or same-sex relationships, or between former spouses or partners. Domestic violence may also involve violence against children or the elderly. It takes a number of forms, including physical, verbal, emotional, economic, religious, reproductive, and sexual abuse, which can range from subtle, coercive forms to marital rape and to violent physical abuse such as choking, beating, female genital mutilation and acid throwing that results in disfigurement or death. Domestic murders include stoning, bride burning, honor killings, and dowry deaths.|$|E

It has been described in medical literature {{as a manifestation of}} factitious disorder or factitious disorder by proxy. Reports of users who deceive Internet forum participants by portraying themselves as gravely ill or as victims of violence first appeared in the 1990s due to the relative newness of Internet communications.

It is not included in the fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).|$|E

As Flanders put it, [...] "It was not his breaches of etiquette, or of rules or sometimes even of laws which is so disturbing," [...] but rather his overall <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior.</b> Ultimately a [...] "bill of particulars" [...] listing 46 charges was added to the censure resolution.

40|$|The {{history of}} {{acquisition}} reform {{dates back to}} the Revolutionary War era, and recommendations and actions to reform the Department of Defense's acquisition system continue today. Common themes emerge from the recommendations of countless Acts, Studies, Panels, and Commissions over the past 30 years, pointing to areas that appear to have the most impact on the system. Despite these actions and recommendations, issues remain at the program execution level, resulting in increased cost and delays in fielding needed capabilities. This work focuses on three areas. A comprehensive Literature Review of acquisition reform activities was conducted. This generated a list of common themes and focus areas that are associated with less than successful program outcomes. Following this, a series <b>of</b> ten <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> (acquisition archetypes) postulated for software programs developed by Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute were examined for applicability to the larger Department of Defense acquisition system and to determine their relationship to acquisition reform actions. As part of this effort, a survey of acquisition personnel was conducted to determine the relevance <b>of</b> these <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior.</b> Based on these foundational works, the final step examined the results of the survey to answer four research questions. First, the survey results were analyzed to determine if the <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> were present with general and statistical relevance. The second question attempted to determine if the <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> led to measurable cost and/or schedule growth if they were present in the respondent's program. Third, the postulated root causes for the behaviors were compared to the common themes from acquisition reform activities to determine alignment. Finally, the survey results were analyzed to see if the <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> correlated to a particular program size, lead service, or "joint" program status. The findings show that the <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> are present in Department of Defense acquisition programs, and some do lead to measurable cost and/or schedule growth when identified. Acquisition Reform activities have been targeted at the areas that are reported as root causes <b>of</b> the <b>behaviors,</b> and one <b>of</b> the ten <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>behavior</b> does correlate with "joint" program status. by Gregory J.
