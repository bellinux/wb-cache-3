By shaping the <b>pulse</b> <b>envelope</b> before it {{is applied to the}} transmitting device, say to a cosine law or a trapezoid, the bandwidth can be limited at source, with less reliance on filtering. When this technique is combined with pulse compression, then a good compromise between efficiency, performance and range resolution can be realised. The diagram on the left shows the effect on the spectrum if a trapezoid pulse profile is adopted. It can be seen that the energy in the sidebands is significantly reduced compared to the main lobe and the amplitude of the main lobe is increased.|$|E

40|$|Light bullets are {{spatially}} localized ultra-short optical pulses in {{more than}} one space dimensions. They contain only a few electromagnetic oscillations under their envelopes and propagate long distances without essentially changing shapes. Light bullets of femtosecond durations have been observed in recent numerical simulation of the full Maxwell systems. The sine–Gordon (SG) equation comes as an asymptotic reduction of the two level dissipationless Maxwell–Bloch system. We derive a new and complete nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation in two space dimensions for the SG <b>pulse</b> <b>envelopes</b> so that it is globally well-posed and has all the relevant higher order terms to regularize the collapse of the standard critical NLS (CNLS). We perform a modulation analysis and found that SG <b>pulse</b> <b>envelopes</b> undergo focusing–defocusing cycles.

40|$|The {{generation}} {{and control of}} optically induced currents {{has the potential to}} become an important building block for optical computers. Here, shift and rectification currents are investigated that emerge from a divergence of the optical susceptibility. It is known that these currents react to the shape of the impinging laser pulse, and especially to the shape of the <b>pulse</b> <b>envelope.</b> The main goal is the systematic manipulation of the <b>pulse</b> <b>envelope</b> with an optical pulse shaper that is integrated into a standard THz emission setup. The initial approach, the chirping of the laser pulse only has a weak influence on the envelope and the currents. Instead, a second approach is suggested that uses the combined envelope of a phase-stable pulse-pair as a parameter. In a laser pulse, the position of the maxima of the electrical field and the <b>pulse</b> <b>envelope</b> are shifted relative to each other. This shift is known as the Carrier-Envelope Phase (CEP). It is a new degree of freedom that is usually only accessible in specially stabilized systems. It is shown, that in a phase-stable pulse-pair, at least the relative CEP is usable as a new degree of freedom. It has a great influence on the shape of the <b>pulse</b> <b>envelope</b> and thus on the current density. It is shown that this approach enables the coherent control of the current density. The experiments are corroborated by a theoretical model of the system. The potential of this approach is demonstrated in an application. A framework is presented that uses an iterative genetic algorithm to create arbitrarily shaped THz traces. The algorithm controls the optical pulse shaper, and varies the phase of the impinging laser pulses until the desired target trace is found...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the use of}} the Stark shift in atomlike systems in order to control the interaction with a high-Q/V microcavity. By applying a Stark shift pulse to a single atomlike system, in order to affect and control its detuning from a cavity resonance, the cavity QED interaction can be carefully controlled so as to allow stochastic pumping of the emitting state without causing random timing jitter in the output photon. Using a quantum trajectory approach, we conduct simulations that show this technique is capable of producing indistinguishable single photons that exhibit complete Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. Furthermore, Stark tuning control allows for the generation of arbitrary <b>pulse</b> <b>envelopes.</b> We demonstrate this by showing that a simple asymmetric Stark shifting pulse can lead to the emission of symmetric Gaussian single-photon <b>pulse</b> <b>envelopes,</b> rather than the usual exponential decay. These Gaussian pulses also exhibit complete Hong-Ou-Mandel interference.

It is shown that Michelson phase conjugating configuration with double passage through array of fiber amplifiers have the definite advantages compared to one-way fiber array coupled in a Mach-Zehnder configuration.
