40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to know the factors influencing farmers 2 ̆ 7 behavior in <b>pest</b> <b>and</b> disease control. Different control methods were practiced by farmers, such as resistant varieties, cultural techniques, biological control, and chemical control. In thisresearch, a survey method was used, total of farmer respondents were 60 people. Results of the research showed that factors influencing farmers 2 ̆ 7 behavior in <b>pest</b> <b>and</b> disease control were age, perception, and work motivation. The increasing age of the farmers resulted better behavior in <b>pest</b> <b>and</b> disease control. A better perception of farmers towards <b>pest</b> <b>and</b> disease control, resulted better behavior in <b>pest</b> <b>and</b> disease control. The increasing work motivation of farmers, resulted better behavior in <b>pest</b> <b>and</b> disease control. Therefore, agricultural extension methods had to be developed by Field Extension Workers to increase work motivation and perception of famers, especially through farmer groups. Agricultural extension activities were best not only to increase farmers 2 ̆ 7 knowledge, but also ability to control plant <b>pest</b> <b>and</b> disease, by using participal method in pleasure situation...|$|R

5|$|Both {{farmers and}} {{scientists}} must continually {{draw on the}} irreplaceable resource of genetic diversity to ensure productive harvests. While genetic variability provides farmers with plants that have a higher resilience to <b>pests</b> <b>and</b> diseases and allows scientists access to a more diverse genome than {{can be found in}} highly selected crops. The breeding of monocultural crops steadily reduces genetic diversity as desirable traits are selected, and undesirable traits are removed. Farmers can increase within-crop diversity to some extent by planting mixtures of crop varieties; they can further increase in-field diversity by polycultural practices such as intercropping and companion planting.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage {{was most}} likely domesticated somewhere in Europe before 1000 BC, {{although}} savoys were not developed until the 16th century. By the Middle Ages, cabbage had become a prominent part of European cuisine. Cabbage heads are generally picked {{during the first year}} of the plant's life cycle, but plants intended for seed are allowed to grow a second year, and must be kept separated from other cole crops to prevent cross-pollination. Cabbage is prone to several nutrient deficiencies, as well as to multiple <b>pests,</b> <b>and</b> bacterial and fungal diseases.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not being}} an {{agricultural}} weed in itself, it hosts {{a number of}} insects and diseases, including both <b>pests</b> <b>and</b> beneficial insects. It is also a potential reservoir of the cucumber mosaic virus, Erysiphum cichoraceum (the cucurbit powdery mildew) and Texas root rot. A study found V.thapsus hosts insects from 29 different families. Most of the pests found were western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), Lygus species such as the tarnished plant bug (L. lineolaris), and various spider mites from the family Tetranychidae. These make the plant a potential reservoir for overwintering pests.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere, {{such as in}} the UK, hares are {{not always}} seen as <b>pests,</b> <b>and</b> there are species action plans aiming to {{significantly}} increase their numbers. Some coursers say that coursing assists conservation because it leads to sporting landowners creating a habitat suitable for hares. Opponents of coursing say that the converse is true, namely that coursing takes place where hares live rather than hares living where coursing takes place. It is also the case that coursing kills slower hares, and it is said by some coursers that this leaves faster hares to breed and multiply.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{grown as}} a hardy annual, lettuce is easily cultivated, {{although}} it requires relatively low temperatures {{to prevent it}} from flowering quickly. It can be plagued by numerous nutrient deficiencies, as well as insect and mammal <b>pests,</b> <b>and</b> fungal and bacterial diseases. L. sativa crosses easily within the species and with some other species within the Lactuca genus. Although this trait can be a problem to home gardeners who attempt to save seeds, biologists have used it to broaden the gene pool of cultivated lettuce varieties.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{diversity}} of crops {{can be used}} to help protect the environment. Crop varieties that are resistant to <b>pests</b> <b>and</b> diseases can reduce the need for application of harmfulpesticides.While crops that are more vigorous can better compete withweeds whichreduces the need for applyingherbicides. This is shown in a case study completed atAarhus Universityin Denmark which used more robust maize.Drought resistant plants can help save water and reduce the need forirrigation whiledeeper rooting varieties can help stabilize soils; and varieties that are more efficient in their use of nutrients require lessfertilizer.|$|E

5|$|Medicinal plants demand {{intensive}} management. Different species each require {{their own}} distinct conditions of cultivation. The World Health Organization recommends {{the use of}} rotation to minimise problems with <b>pests</b> <b>and</b> plant diseases. Cultivation may be traditional or may make use of conservation agriculture practices to maintain organic matter in the soil and to conserve water, for example with no-till farming systems. In many medicinal and aromatic plants, plant characteristics vary widely with soil type and cropping strategy, so care is required to obtain satisfactory yields.|$|E
5|$|Mollusc {{species can}} also {{represent}} hazards or pests for human activities. The {{bite of the}} blue-ringed octopus is often fatal, and that of Octopus apollyon causes inflammation that can last for over a month. Stings from a few species of large tropical cone shells can also kill, but their sophisticated, though easily produced, venoms have become important tools in neurological research. Schistosomiasis (also known as bilharzia, bilharziosis or snail fever) is transmitted to humans via water snail hosts, and affects about 200million people. Snails and slugs can also be serious agricultural <b>pests,</b> <b>and</b> accidental or deliberate introduction of some snail species into new environments has seriously damaged some ecosystems.|$|E

5|$|Since {{birds are}} highly visible and common animals, humans {{have had a}} {{relationship}} with them since the dawn of man. Sometimes, these relationships are mutualistic, like the cooperative honey-gathering among honeyguides and African peoples such as the Borana. Other times, they may be commensal, as when species such as the house sparrow have benefited from human activities. Several bird species have become commercially significant agricultural <b>pests,</b> <b>and</b> some pose an aviation hazard. Human activities can also be detrimental, and have threatened numerous bird species with extinction (hunting, avian lead poisoning, pesticides, roadkill, wind turbine kills and predation by pet cats and dogs are common sources of death for birds).|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} molluscs, {{particularly}} certain snails and slugs, can be serious crop <b>pests,</b> <b>and</b> when introduced into new environments, can unbalance local ecosystems. One such pest, the giant African snail Achatina fulica, {{has been introduced}} to many parts of Asia, {{as well as to}} many islands in the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. In the 1990s, this species reached the West Indies. Attempts to control it by introducing the predatory snail Euglandina rosea proved disastrous, as the predator ignored Achatina fulica and went on to extirpate several native snail species, instead.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene grey parakeet was grey, {{had a long}} tail, and {{was larger}} than other species of the Psittacula genus, which are usually green.

They were also {{considered}} to be crop <b>pests</b> <b>and</b> being such easy prey meant that they were extensively hunted. Coupled with deforestation, this pushed them into extinction. This had happened by the 1730s on Réunion and by the 1760s on Mauritius.|$|E

5|$|The {{consequences}} of a persistent biotic crisis have been predicted to last {{for at least five}} million years. It could result in a decline in biodiversity and homogenization of biotas, accompanied by a proliferation of species that are opportunistic, such as <b>pests</b> <b>and</b> weeds. Novel species may also emerge; in particular taxa that prosper in human-dominated ecosystems may rapidly diversify into many new species. Microbes are likely to benefit from the increase in nutrient-enriched environmental niches. No new species of existing large vertebrates are likely to arise and food chains will probably be shortened.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{populations of}} black wildebeest, endemic to the {{southern}} part of Africa, were almost completely exterminated in the 19th century, due to their reputation as <b>pests</b> <b>and</b> the value of their hides and meat. However, the species has been reintroduced widely from captive specimens, both in private areas and nature reserves throughout most of Lesotho, Swaziland, and South Africa. It has also been introduced outside its natural range in Namibia and Kenya.|$|E
5|$|A {{potential}} {{obstacle to}} the adoption of biological pest control measures is growers sticking to the familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides have a variety of undesired effects, including the development of resistance among <b>pests,</b> <b>and</b> the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.|$|E
