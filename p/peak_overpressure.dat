40|$|The {{issue of}} whether shocked quartz can be {{produced}} by explosive volcanic events is important in understanding {{the origin of the}} K-T boundary constituents. Proponents of a volcanic origin for the shocked quartz at the K-T boundary cite the suggestion of Rice, that <b>peak</b> <b>overpressures</b> of 1000 kbars can be generated during explosive volcanic eruptions, and may have occurred during the May, 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens. Attention was previously drawn to the fact that <b>peak</b> <b>overpressures</b> during explosive eruptions are limited by the strength of the rock confining the magma chamber to less than 8 kbars even under ideal conditions. The proposed volcanic mechanisms for generating pressures sufficient to shock quartz are further examined. Theoretical arguments, field evidence and petrographic data are presented showing that explosive volcanic eruptions cannot generate shock metamorphic features of the kind seen in minerals at the K-T boundary...|$|R

5000|$|This {{explosive}} {{can also}} be gelled through the addition of nitrocellulose, ETN, or any number of soluble nitrate esters or gelling agents. This allows for powdered metals, such as aluminum or magnesium, to be suspended in the mixture. The metal powders act as fuel, increasing heat and energy output but lowering the brisance and VoD. The result is a more sustained blast wave and a [...] "push and heave" [...] effect, desirable for thermobaric purposes. Trzciński reports that 200 grams of a mixture of NM with PMMA as gelling agent and AlMg (45:55, mean particle size = 63 microns) as fuel, in a ratio of 67.2/2.8/30 by mass, has a <b>peak</b> <b>overpressure</b> of 120 kPa 2 m from the (open air) blast site, a 1.65 TNT equivalency in peak pressure, and a 1.62 equivalency in shockwave impulse.|$|E
50|$|For today's {{supersonic}} aircraft in normal operating conditions, the <b>peak</b> <b>overpressure</b> varies {{from less than}} 50 to 500 Pa (1 to 10 psf (pound per square foot)) for an N-wave boom. Peak overpressures for U-waves are amplified two to five times the N-wave, but this amplified overpressure impacts {{only a very small}} area when compared to the area exposed {{to the rest of the}} sonic boom. The strongest sonic boom ever recorded was 7,000 Pa (144 psf) and it did not cause injury to the researchers who were exposed to it. The boom was produced by an F-4 flying just above the speed of sound at an altitude of 100 ft. In recent tests, the maximum boom measured during more realistic flight conditions was 1,010 Pa (21 psf). There is a probability that some damage — shattered glass, for example — will result from a sonic boom. Buildings in good condition should suffer no damage by pressures of 530 Pa (11 psf) or less. And, typically, community exposure to sonic boom is below 100 Pa (2 psf). Ground motion resulting from sonic boom is rare and is well below structural damage thresholds accepted by the U.S. Bureau of Mines and other agencies.|$|E

50|$|In general, primary blast {{injuries}} {{are characterized by}} the absence of external injuries; thus internal {{injuries are}} frequently unrecognized and their severity underestimated. According to the latest experimental results, the extent and types of primary blast-induced injuries depend not only on the <b>peak</b> of the <b>overpressure,</b> but also other parameters such as number of <b>overpressure</b> <b>peaks,</b> time-lag between <b>overpressure</b> <b>peaks,</b> characteristics of the shear fronts between <b>overpressure</b> <b>peaks,</b> frequency resonance, and electromagnetic pulse, among others. There is general agreement that spalling, implosion, inertia, and pressure differentials are the main mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of primary blast injuries. Thus, the majority of prior research focused on the mechanisms of blast injuries within gas-containing organs and organ systems such as the lungs, while primary blast-induced traumatic brain injury has remained underestimated. Blast lung refers to severe pulmonary contusion, bleeding or swelling with damage to alveoli and blood vessels, or a combination of these.

50|$|To {{enable the}} ROC {{to operate in}} a nuclear environment, changes were {{necessary}} to both centres and posts {{in order to provide}} protection against blast effects and radiation from nuclear bursts. It would also now be necessary for control centres and observation posts to be occupied for a period of between seven and twenty one days following any nuclear event. Between 1958 and 1968 a countrywide building programme resulted in a network of 1,563 underground monitoring posts, approximately eight miles apart, distributed throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, at an estimated cost of almost £5,000 each. The posts were excavated to a depth of twenty five feet, a monocoque reinforced concrete building was cast and bitumen tanked (or waterproofed), before the whole structure was covered by a compacted soil mound. Entry was facilitated by a steel ladder in a vertical shaft leading to a single room, providing accommodation for three observers to live and work, with a separate toilet compartment with chemical closet. Air was circulated from grilled ventilators {{at both ends of the}} post and electricity was provided by a crated 12 volt lead-acid battery, charged occasionally by a portable petrol electric generator. New instrumentation detected the <b>peak</b> <b>overpressure</b> from any nuclear burst, together with photographic indications of the burst location and size, plus resulting levels of radiation. Conditions in these spartan posts were cramped, cold, and in some cases damp. ROC centres were renamed as Controls and provided with bomb proof nuclear protected buildings. A small number of these were converted from suitable pre-existing Second World War anti-aircraft operations rooms (AAORs), with the remainder specially constructed as above ground or semi-sunk blockhouse buildings. These were constructed to a standard layout, dependent upon the subsoil composition at the construction site. Controls provided living and operational accommodation for up to a hundred observers and UKWMO warning teams. Included in the centre layout were male and female dormitories, kitchen and canteen provision, life support systems and decontamination facilities, a communications centre and a split level central operations room with balcony positions.|$|E

The results show that in the explosion propagation process, the <b>peak</b> <b>overpressure</b> firstly decreases, then increases, and then attenuates until to zero. However, flame propagation speed firstly increases, then begins to reduce and decreases until to zero. With the increase of methane filling length, the safety distance firstly increases and then decreases slightly, and the maximum distance of flame propagation increases linearly. With the increase of methane filling length, the initial <b>peak</b> <b>overpressure</b> and the maximum <b>peak</b> <b>overpressure</b> obviously increase, the <b>peak</b> <b>overpressure</b> and the maximum temperature in other points almost continually increase, and the distance where <b>peak</b> <b>overpressure</b> begins to rise and obtains its maximum value also increases. The time of flame arrival in the same point at various filling lengths is almost the same before flame speed begins to decrease, indicating that flame speed is almost the same before it decreases.

It was found that the <b>peak</b> <b>overpressure</b> evolutions under three different angles experienced three different stages, i. e. a slight downtrend before the bend, a sudden uptrend in and after the bend, and a following downtrend. The explosion violence was enhanced due to a reflection wave and flame tip wrinkle.

40|$|In arena blast testing, {{a common}} and {{economical}} practice employed is to distribute several targets radially around a central charge. However, if these targets are positioned too proximally, reflections and diffractions of blast waves off neighbouring cubicles {{can affect the}} nature of expected blast loading. Computational fluid dynamics software has been used through an extensive series of simulations to identify the levels of interference in incident pressure–time histories with and without an obstructing target present. The data were post-processed to identify the Cartesian co-ordinates in which different levels of interference in <b>peak</b> incident <b>overpressure</b> and incident positive phase impulse were achieved. The results indicated that in all cases, there was a greater interference in <b>peak</b> incident <b>overpressure</b> than incident positive phase impulse values directly proximal to the target but, at greater separations, significant differences in incident positive phase impulse existed where <b>peak</b> incident <b>overpressure</b> had returned to free-field equivalent magnitudes. When compared with the established ‘rules of thumb’ for cubicle placement, for targets at different stand-off ranges, an angle of 45 ° to the rear cubicle still holds some practical relevance, although it is too acute to cover all interference effects. For targets positioned at the same stand-off range, a separation distance of two cubicle widths is generally too conservative and, in many cases, more cubicles can be positioned around the charge. A bespoke recommendation table has been presented for targets at stand-off ranges between 15 and 50 m to allow users to identify the minimum distance from a target at which obstructed-field <b>peak</b> incident <b>overpressure</b> and incident positive phase impulse values differ negligibly from free-field equivalents...|$|R
