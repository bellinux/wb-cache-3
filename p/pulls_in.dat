5|$|Gliders {{are often}} {{launched}} using a stationary ground-based winch {{mounted on a}} heavy vehicle. This method is widely used at many European clubs, often {{in addition to an}} aerotow service. The engine is usually powered by LPG, petrol or diesel, though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used. The winch <b>pulls</b> <b>in</b> a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500ft) cable, made of high-tensile steel wire or a synthetic fiber, attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 35% of the cable length after a short, steep ride. A strong headwind will result in higher launches.|$|E
5|$|These {{moves are}} {{designed}} to be used in flurry combinations. For instance, the player can Seismic Slam an opponent, which <b>pulls</b> <b>in</b> enemies, and progress into a Rising Uppercut, which tosses the opponent into the air. During that toss, the player can charge the Rocket Punch and release as the opponent returns to the ground. Alternatively, the player can launch into the air, pick an opponent to slam, and punch them at close range. The character is built for aggressive playstyles and advanced players.|$|E

25|$|South Africa: Ugly Betty premiered in South Africa on Pay Channel, M-Net on Tuesday July 17, 2007. It {{later was}} re-broadcast on sister channels, GO and M-Net Holiday. The first season fared well with audience's {{and was a}} hit for the channel with a strong buzz around the show. Due to heavy {{promotions}} for the show across all media spectrums by M-Net, the premiere episode of Ugly Betty attracted 80% more viewers than Smallville which previously occupied its time slot. M-Net marketing General Manager, Koo Govender, says the first episode was watched by about 432,000 viewers. Generally for its first season, Ugly Betty often generated 350 000 viewers with each airing, bringing in good ratings for the channel. Seasons 2 and 3 aired in the same timeslot as its premiere season; Tuesday evenings at 7:30 pm CAT, with Season 2 premiering on March 25, 2008. The channel premiered Season 3 on Tuesday January 13.

500|$|Director Peter Berg said {{prior to}} Hancocks release {{that if the}} film <b>pulls</b> <b>in</b> as much {{business}} as predicted, a sequel, Hancock 2, would likely follow.

[...] In August 2009, Columbia Pictures hired screenwriters Adam Fierro and Glen Mazzara to write the sequel, and the studio plans to bring back the producing team from the original film. [...] Charlize Theron confirmed that she would reprise her role, and Berg said to expect a third actor to star as another figure with powers like Smith's and Theron's characters.|$|E

[...] Tom Breihan of Stereogum reviewed the special positively, calling the episode an [...] "oddly patriotic work that <b>pulls</b> <b>in</b> all sorts of American iconography". Rachel Haas of Paste magazine praised the special being released close to Independence Day, stating [...] "this suite would possibly soundtrack the coolest, weirdest fireworks show ever." [...] Leor Galil of the Chicago Reader featured the video for his [...] "12 O'Clock Track", praising Hughes' manipulation of Cityscape Chicago by cinematographer Eric Hines. However, given the tracks' length, he argued the episode would best be enjoyed [...] "through a nice pair of speakers at a barbecue instead of spending that time with your eyes affixed to a computer screen." ...|$|E

2500|$|Higher speeds can be {{attained}} if the skydiver <b>pulls</b> <b>in</b> {{his or her}} limbs (see also freeflying). In this case, the terminal velocity increases to about 320km/h (200mph or 90m/s), which is almost the terminal velocity of the peregrine falcon diving down on its prey.

2500|$|James Roman {{observes the}} effect of sound in the scene where Chigurh <b>pulls</b> <b>in</b> for gas at the Texaco rest stop. [...] " [...] scene evokes an eerie {{portrayal}} of innocence confronting evil," [...] he says, [...] "with the subtle images richly nuanced by sound. As the scene opens in a long shot, the screen {{is filled with the}} remote location of the rest stop with the sound of the Texaco sign mildly squeaking in a light breeze. The sound and image of a crinkled cashew wrapper tossed on the counter adds to the tension as the paper twists and turns. The intimacy and potential horror that it suggests is never elevated to a level of kitschy drama as the tension rises from the mere sense of quiet and doom that prevails." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dropping the fly {{onto the}} water and its {{subsequent}} movement on or beneath the surface is one of fly fishing's most difficult aspects; the angler is attempting to cast {{in such a way}} that the line lands smoothly on {{the water and}} the fly appears as natural as possible. At a certain point, if a fish does not strike, depending upon the action of the fly in the wind or current, the angler picks up the line to make another presentation. On the other hand, if a fish strikes, the angler <b>pulls</b> <b>in</b> line while raising the rod tip. This [...] "sets" [...] the hook in the fish's mouth. The fish is played either by hand, where the angler continues to hold the fly line in one hand to control the tension applied to the fish, or by reeling up any slack in the line and then using the hand to act as a drag on the reel. Most modern fly reels have an adjustable, mechanical drag system to control line tension during a fish's run.|$|E

Mr. Holloway talks about this time of night as [...] "soul's midnight," [...] when men are closest to death, locked in the depths of despair. The boys go the next day to explore the carnival and they encounter their seventh grade teacher, Miss Foley, who is dazed after visiting the Mirror Maze. Jim insists on coming back that night and Will agrees, but when they bump into the lightning-rod salesman's bag, they realize that they must stay to learn what happens after dark. After investigating all of the rides, they go up to a carousel. Mr. Cooger suddenly grabs Will and Jim after they climb up on horses and he informs them the merry-go-round is broken. Another man arrives and tells him to put them down, introducing himself as Mr. Dark and tells them the huge man's name is Mr. Cooger. Mr. Dark pays attention only to Jim, who is enthralled by what he sees. He then tells the boys to come back the next day and offers them passes to the carousel. [...] They run away and then hide and wait. Both witness Mr. Cooger riding backwards on the carousel (as the music plays backwards), and when he steps off, to their shock- he is twelve years old.|$|E

Most of those who had been on the estrade now left it, and, in a few minutes, the living carpet of heads around the little area in front of the bailiff was reduced to a few hundreds of those whose better feelings were stronger than their self indulgence.
