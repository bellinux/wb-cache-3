6000|$|The hot drink {{helped us}} through the bleak hours that precede the dawn. The sky low by the horizon took on the {{delicate}} tints of pink and yellow {{like the inside of}} a rare shell. And higher, where it glowed with a <b>pearly</b> <b>sheen,</b> a small black cloud appeared, like a forgotten fragment of the night set in a border of dazzling gold. The beams of light skipped on the crests of waves. The eyes of men turned to the eastward. The sunlight flooded their weary faces. They were giving themselves up to fatigue as though they had done for ever with their work. On Singleton's black oilskin coat the dried salt glistened like hoar frost. He hung on by the wheel, with open and lifeless eyes. Captain Allistoun, unblinking, faced the rising sun. His lips stirred, opened {{for the first time in}} twenty-four hours, and with a fresh firm voice he cried, [...] "Wear ship!" ...|$|E
60|$|Now with a rough bandage hastily tied round {{his head}} where grape-shot had lacerated cheek and ear, with a bayonet thrust in the thigh {{and another in}} the arm, Bobby had {{remained}} lying there with many thousands round him as silent, as uncomplaining, as he--in the down-trodden corn--and with the tramp of thousands of galloping, fleeing horses, the clash of steel and fusillade of tirailleurs and artillery reaching his dimmed senses like a distant echo {{from the land of}} ghosts. And before his eyes--half veiled in unconsciousness, there flitted the tender, delicate vision of Crystal de Cambray: of her blue eyes and soft fair hair, done up in a quaint mass of tiny curls; of the scarf of filmy lace which she always liked to wrap round her shoulders, and through the lace the <b>pearly</b> <b>sheen</b> of her skin, of her arms, and of her throat. The air around him had become pure and rarified: that horrible stench of powder and smoke and blood no longer struck his nostrils--it was roses, roses all around him--crimson roses--sweet and caressing and fragrant--with soft, velvety petals that brushed against his cheek--and from somewhere close by came a dreamy melody, the half-sad, half-gay lilt of an intoxicating dance.|$|E
50|$|Her wide {{repertory}} also embraced Marzelline, Agathe, Amina, Lucia, Luisa, Gilda, Violetta, Mimi, Liù, Marguerite, Micaela, Antonia, etc., in all {{of which}} one can appreciate the <b>pearly</b> <b>sheen</b> of her voice and the brilliance of her coloratura technique.|$|E
5000|$|The shell {{grows to}} {{a length of}} 10 mm. The shell has a conical shape, with a broad and tumid base and a wide narrowed umbilicus. The surface is {{cross-hatched}} like a file. When fresh, the shell is translucent with a <b>pearly</b> <b>sheen.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 11-14 mm. It is an extremely variable species in terms of size, ground colour and pattern, yet is easily identified {{by a combination of}} features. The orbicular spot usually is rounded, surrounded by a thin black line, and the spot itself usually is paler than the ground colour. The reniform spot is oblique, with {{the lower part of the}} spot projecting toward the anal angle of the wing. The light and dark marks on the forewing, and the tendency for longitudinal streaks on the wing, give the forewing a busy appearance. The hindwings in males are white, often with a slight <b>pearly</b> <b>sheen</b> and with fuscous shading confined to the veins and outer part of the wing. Some females have more extensive fuscous shading on the hindwings, but usually a <b>pearly</b> <b>sheen</b> is still evident. Adults have been recorded on wing in the south from April to late June and again from early September to early November. In the Pacific Northwest they fly from mid-July to late September.|$|E
50|$|Chesapeake Bay Macoma clams (both balthica and tenta) have {{thin and}} fragile shells. The {{elongate}} macoma (Macoma tenta) get their name from their elongated shell with a shell proportion (width/length) that {{is greater than}} 1.5. The narrowed macoma clam’s shells {{tend to be more}} elongated than the Baltic macoma’s shells and have a smoother, <b>pearly</b> <b>sheen</b> that is slightly iridescent. The smooth shell may have several fine concentric growth lines which indicate yearly growth. Their color is white to yellowish compared to the pinkish tint of the Baltic macoma clam. They have a narrowed posterior end that is slightly twisted or curved to the left and the anterior end is long and rounded. These clams have one foot which helps to hold them in place and two siphons, tube-like structures in which water flows. Their long, thin, flexible siphons are of unequal length and fully retractable. The narrowed macoma clam only grows to a length of approximately three-quarters of an inch.|$|E
50|$|Tectus dentatus has a {{shell that}} reaches a size of 40 - 150 mm. The large, {{imperforate}} shell is conical-turreted shape, solid and heavy, The surface shows strong rounded protuberances {{and it is}} whitish or pale brown, while the base has a blue-green color with <b>pearly</b> <b>sheen.</b> It contains about 12 whorls. These are planulate, more or less obviously finely radiately wrinkled. They often show a few spiral rows of beads, finely, very obliquely striate, but all this surface sculpture is often obsolescent. The periphery of the whorls and at the sutures is armed with distant strong radiating solid knobs, about six to ten on the body whorl. The base of the shell is flat, smooth, partly polished, with an appearance of obsolete concentric lirae about. the central portion, white, or with a zone of blue or of green or both colors surrounding the axial tract. The aperture is transverse, rather wide, rhomboidal. The basal margin is regularly curved, 6 to 8 plicate within near the columellar termination. The columella is very short, the fold stout, heavy, directed downward.|$|E
40|$|The Botín Art Centre in Santander has a geometrically {{complex and}} constructively {{sophisticated}} architectural envelope. What stands out is its outer <b>pearly</b> <b>sheen</b> ceramic cladding. It {{consists of an}} innovative disc-shaped ceramic anchoring system attached to an aluminium tray {{by means of a}} threaded rod fixed with epoxy resin. In this article, we will address the technical development and on-site set up of this continuous enclosure. We will also comment on the results of the test runs performed to prove the viability of this cladding in Santander’s maritime climate...|$|E
