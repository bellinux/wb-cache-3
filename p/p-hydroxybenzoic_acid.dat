Catalyst recycling experiments were conducted in batch reactor and long-term stability tests were conducted in trickle-bed reactor. In all experiments, ruthenium and support materials were perfectly stable to leaching, sintering and fouling. Ruthenium catalysts experienced a weak deactivation as they were exposed to air, e. g., in recycling experiments however the loss of activity occurred only after the first exposure and was completely reversible upon catalyst reduction.

40|$|Bench-scale {{tests were}} {{conducted}} {{to assess the impact}} of the most representative phenolic compounds present in olive mill wastewater (OMW), two cinnamic acid derivatives (p-coumaric and caffeic acids) and two benzoic <b>acid</b> derivatives (<b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> and protocatechuic <b>acids),</b> on the kinetics of acetoclastic methanogenesis. Phenolic compounds were added to cultures transferred from an acetate-enriched seed culture reactor. A control without phenolic compound was included as a basis for comparison. Unacclimated cultures were used to minimize the biodegradation of the toxic organic chemicals during the test. A finite-difference, non-linear, least-squares algorithm was used to estimate kinetic parameters by obtaining a best fit of the experimental data to the classical Monod growth and substrate utilization model. Resulting kinetic coefficients revealed substantial changes in both the maximum rate of acetate conversion, k, and the half-velocity coefficient, Ks, when both cinnamic and benzoic acid derivatives were used. The relative effect of the phenolic compound was manifested in a decrease in the value of k or an increase in the value of Ks as the phenolic compound concentration increased. Therefore, mixed inhibition was occurring. In addition, the toxic effects were clearly related to the molecular structure of the phenolic compound in each pair of toxicants studied, the inhibitory impact being greater for the ortho-diphenols (caffeic and protocatechuic acids) in relation to their corresponding monophenolic compounds (p-coumaric and <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> <b>acids,</b> respectively). <br/...|$|R

C. 4. 3. 1. 5.) (PAL), lignin content, and cucumber root growth was {{compared to that of}} benzoic <b>acid</b> (<b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> and vanillic <b>acids.</b> Roots treated with ferulic and p-coumaric acids were found to have an increased activity of PAL, a higher lignin content, and lower growth indices. No similar effect was recorded in the case of <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> and vanillic <b>acids.</b> The application of ethylene synthesis inhibitor, (aminooxy) acetic acid (AOA), cancelled out the effect of ferulic and p-coumaric acids on the activity of PAL. Lignin content in roots treated with ferulic acid remained on the control level when using the inhibitor, while that in roots treated with p-coumaric acid increased. The obtained results suggest that an increase in the activity level of PAL induced by the action of ferulic and p-coumaric acids, depended on ethylene synthesis. A consequence of changes in the studied enzyme activity was an increased lignin content, {{and in the case of}} p-coumaric acid also a direct participation of that compound in their synthesis. A consequence of the above changes was inhibition of the growth of cucumber roots treated with ferulic and p-coumaric acids...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of vegetal extracts derived from red grape, blueberry fruits and hawthorn leaves on Zea mays L. plant {{growth and the}} activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), a key enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway, was investigated in laboratory experiments.

In addition, phenols content was determined by HPLC, whereas the content of indoleacetic acid and isopentenyladenosine hormones was determined by ELISA test and the auxin and gibberellin-like activities by plant-bioassays. The treated maize revealed increased root and leaf biomass, chlorophyll and sugars content with respect to untreated plants. Hawthorn, red grape skin and blueberry at 1. 0 mL/L induced high p-coumaric content values, whilst hawthorn also showed high amounts of gallic and <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> <b>acids.</b> PAL activity induced by hawthorn at 1. 0 mL/L had the highest values (11. 1 -fold UNT) and was strongly and linearly related with the sum of leaf phenols.

Concentrations of {{total organic carbon}} (TOC) were also determined in the ice core. Levoglucosan, which is produced by pyrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose and thus is a general tracer of biomass burning, showed sporadic peaks in the years of 1705, 1759, 1883, 1915, 1949 and 1972, with the largest peak in 1949. However, its concentrations did not show a systematic increase {{in the last century}} although the concentration peaks seemingly corresponded to the higher ambient temperatures in the northern high latitudes. In contrast, dehydroabietic acid, a specific tracer of the pyrolysis of conifer resin, showed a gradual increase from the early 1900 s to 1990 s with a significant peak in 1970. Contributions of dehydroabietic acid to TOC also showed an increasing trend for the 20 th century. Similarly, vanillic and <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> <b>acids</b> presented higher concentrations in the last half-century with sporadic peaks in 1705, 1759 and 1949. This study showed that general biomass burning tracers such as levoglucosan have been sporadically transported over the glacier of the Kamchatka Peninsula. In contrast, the ice core record of dehydroabietic acid indicated that fires of boreal conifer forest have more frequently and increasingly occurred in Far East and Siberia during the last century and transported to the Northwestern Pacific. The present study demonstrates that organic tracers of biomass burning preserved in ice core could provide historical records of biomass burning and boreal forest fires...|$|R

Health benefits of garlic depend on its content of biologically-active compounds, which differs between cultivars and geographical regions. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate and compare the biological activity of aqueous extracts from nine garlic varieties from different countries (Poland, Spain, China, Portugal, Burma, Thailand and Uzbekistan). Antioxidant properties were evaluated through free radical scavenging (DPPH•, ABTS•+) and ion chelation (Fe 2 +, Cu 2 +) activities. The cytotoxicity of garlic extracts was evaluated in vitro using Neutral Red Uptake assay in normal human skin fibroblasts. The obtained results revealed that garlic extracts contained the highest amount of syringic and <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> <b>acids</b> derivatives. The lowest IC 50 values for DPPH•, ABTS•+ scavenging and Cu 2 + chelating ability were determined in Chinese garlic extracts (4. 63, 0. 43 and 14. 90 μg/mL, respectively). Extracts from Spanish cultivar Morado and Chinese garlic were highly cytotoxic to human skin fibroblasts as they reduced cellular proliferation by 70 – 90 %.

40|$|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In Russian {{traditional}} medicine, {{an extract}} from the mushroom Inonotus obliquus (Fr.) Pil´at {{is used as}} an anti-tumor medicine and diuretic. It {{has been reported that}} Inonotus obliquus has therapeutic effects, such as anti-inflammatory, immuno-modulatory and hepatoprotective effects. This study was designed to investigate the chemical composition and biological properties of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of Inonotus obliquus from Finland, Russia, and Thailand. Their antioxidative, antimicrobial, and antiquorum properties were tested as well as the cytotoxicity on various tumor cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The tested extract was subjected to conventional chemical study to identified organic acids and phenolic compounds. Antioxidative activity was measured by several different assays. Antimicrobial potential of extracts was tested by microdilution method, and antiquorum sensing activity and antibiofilm formation of Inonotus obliquus extracts was tested on Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cytotoxicity of the extracts was tested on tumor cells (MCF- 7, NCI-H 460, HeLa and HepG 2) and non-tumor liver cells primary cultures. RESULTS: Oxalic acid was found as the main organic acid, with the highest amount in the aqueous extract from Russia. Gallic, protocatechuic and <b>p-hydroxybenzoic</b> <b>acids</b> were detected in all samples. Inonotus obliquus extracts showed high antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. Extracts were tested at subMIC for anti-quorum sensing (AQS) activity in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and all extracts showed definite AQS activity. The assays were done using twitching and swarming of bacterial cultures, and the amount of produced pyocyanin as QS parameters. All the extracts demonstrated cytotoxic effect on four tumor cell lines and not on primary porcine liver cells PLP 2. CONCLUSIONS: As the Inonotus obliquus presence in Chaga conks is limited, further purification is necessary to draw quantitative conclusions. The presence of AQS activity in medicinal mushrooms suggests a broader anti-infectious disease protection than only immunomodulatory effects...|$|R
