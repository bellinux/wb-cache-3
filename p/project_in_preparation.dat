For example, polar-orbiting satellites observe Earth from space, monitoring the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial processes, and generate massive amounts of environmental data. The current generation of satellites, such as the National Aeronautic and Space Administration 2 ̆ 7 s (NASA) Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra and Aqua satellites, generate about 1. 5 terrabytes of data per day. In the USA, there are remote-sensing <b>projects</b> <b>in</b> <b>preparation</b> that will dwarf even these datasets.

40|$|International audienceThe {{question}} whether isoscalar pairing between neutrons and protons {{gives rise to}} correlationeffects similar to those observed for the isovector pairing between identical nucleons remainsunanswered. Some schematic properties of “ideal” isoscalar-pair condensates are pointed out. Isoscalar-pairing correlations can be probed with deuteron transfer reactions, which are thesubject of an experimental programme at GANIL. It is shown that simple predictions based on theassumption of a pair vibrational behaviour can assist {{in the interpretation of}} such experiments. Adifferent but related question is whether the low-energy structure of N~Z nuclei can be interpretedin terms of spin-aligned isoscalar pairs. This hypothesis can be tested, for example by measuringmagnetic and quadrupole moments of isomeric levels in odd-odd N=Z nuclei, such as for instance 94 Ag or 90 Rh, {{which is one of the}} aims of the S 3 <b>project</b> <b>in</b> <b>preparation</b> at GANIL...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLongitudinal instabilities {{are one of}} {{the main}} {{limitations}} in the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) to reach the beam parameters required for the High Luminosity LHC <b>project.</b> <b>In</b> <b>preparation</b> to the SPS upgrade, possible remedies are studied by performing macroparticle simulations using the machine impedance model obtained from electromagnetic simulations and measurements. To benchmark the impedance model, the results of simulations are compared with various beam measurements. In this study, the reactive part of the impedance was probed by measuring the quadrupole frequency shift with intensity, obtained from bunch length oscillations at mismatched injection into the SPS. This method was applied over many last years to follow up the evolution of the SPS impedance, injecting bunches with the same bunch length. A novel approach, giving significantly more information, consists in varying the injected bunch length. The comparison of these measurements with macroparticle simulations allowed us to test the existing model, identify some missing SPS impedance and to obtain its possible dependence on frequency...|$|E
