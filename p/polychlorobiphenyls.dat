Here, we report on the potential of slow and fast desorbing sediment-bound <b>polychlorobiphenyl</b> (PCB) fractions for accumulation in carp (Cyprinus carpio) in lake enclosures treated with different nutrient doses. Routes of PCB uptake were quantitatively evaluated for 15 PCBs (log K- 0 W range 5. 6 - 7. 8) using model analysis. Fast-desorbing PCB fractions in the sediment were defined as the ratio of 6 -h Tenax-extractable to (total) Soxhlet-extractable concentrations. These fractions varied between 4 and 22 % and did not show a clear trend with log K- 0 W. However, bioaccumulation of PCBs in carp correlated much better with Tenax-extractable concentrations than with total-extractable concentrations. Nutrient additions in the enclosures had a positive effect on PCB accumulation. Model results show that PCB uptake in carp can be explained from (1) uptake through invertebrate food, (2) uptake from fast-desorbing fractions in ingested sediments, and (3) uptake from water, where PCBs are in partitioning equilibrium with fast-desorbing fractions.

The partial dechlorination using organic mediators was successful and good control of the reaction (i. e., monodechlorination) and good efficiency could be achieved. Some mediators showed poor current efficiencies due to the lower stability of their anion radical in the presence of protons. The monodechlorination of trichlorobenzene with four different mediators showed that the product distribution in terms of initial chlorine removed was little affected by the mediator used. This product distribution has also been investigated for the whole series of polychlorobenzenes. Polydechlorination using a single mediator was tried using biphenyl, anthracene, and dibenzofuran. After passing enough charge to completely dechlorinate trichlorobenzene, few chlorinated benzenes remained in solution and less than the expected amount of benzene was detected.
