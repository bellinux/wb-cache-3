Makoto confronts Izumi, after which both he and Izumi fall off a cliff. They travel back in time, retaining their memories of the past six days. Makoto accepts that he has traveled through time, and Izumi reveals {{that she is the}} professor in charge of the seminar camp, and that {{the events of the past}} week were a science experiment; she attempted to test the phenomenon known as Curé Syndrome, where if multiple <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> a delusion and the delusion is spread to others, the delusion becomes reality. Makoto was the test subject of the experiment, which was meant to involve him having the delusion that he could have premonitions; unexpectedly, he turned out to have real premonitions.|$|E

500|$|Eliminative materialism (also called eliminativism) [...] is {{the claim}} that people's {{common-sense}} understanding of the mind (or folk psychology) is false and that certain classes of s that most <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> do not exist. It is a materialist position {{in the philosophy of}} mind. Some supporters of eliminativism argue that no coherent neural basis will be found for many everyday psychological concepts such as belief or desire, since they are poorly defined. Rather, they argue that psychological concepts of behaviour and experience should be judged by how well they reduce to the biological level. Other versions entail the non-existence of conscious mental states such as pain and visual perceptions.|$|E

Pausch later commented about this in an interview, saying [...] "A couple of hundred people in a room, looking and listening and laughing and applauding– hopefully at the appropriate times– that gives a lot of validation to my kids that a lot of <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> this, {{and a lot of people}} who knew me believe that I did my best to try to live this way."

2500|$|As {{to those}} who refuse to be oedipalized {{in one form or}} another, at one end or the other in the treatment, the {{psychoanalyst}} is there to call the asylum or the police for help. The police on our side!—never did psychoanalysis better display its taste for supporting the movement of social repression, and for participating in it with enthusiasm. [...] notice of the dominant tone in the most respected associations: [...] consider Dr. Mendel and the Drs Stéphane, the state of fury that is theirs, and their literally police-like appeal at the thought that someone might try to escape the Oedipal dragnet.

2500|$|Dewey's biographer Richard Norton Smith wrote, [...] "For fifteen years... {{these two}} combatants waged {{political}} warfare. Their dispute pitted East against Midwest, city against countryside, internationalist against isolationist, pragmatic liberals against principled conservatives. Each man thought himself the genuine spokesman of the future; each denounced {{the other as}} a political heretic." [...] In a 1949 speech, Dewey criticized Taft and his followers by saying that [...] "we have in our party some fine, high-minded patriotic people who honestly oppose farm price supports, unemployment insurance, old age benefits, slum clearance, and other social programs... these <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> a laissez-faire society and look back wistfully to the miscalled 'good old days' of the nineteenth century... if such efforts {{to turn back the}} clock are actually pursued, you can bury the Republican Party as the deadest pigeon in the country."

But they ought not to do it as Republicans." ...|$|E
2500|$|Generally, {{cultural}} diplomacy is {{more focused on}} the longer term and less on specific policy matters. [...] The intent is to build up influence {{over the long term}} for when it is needed by engaging people directly. [...] This influence has implications ranging from national security to increasing tourism and commercial opportunities. [...] It allows the government to create a [...] "foundation of trust" [...] and a mutual understanding that is neutral and built on people-to-people contact. [...] Another unique and important element of {{cultural diplomacy}} is its ability to reach youth, non-elites and other audiences outside of the traditional embassy circuit. [...] In short, cultural diplomacy plants the seeds of ideals, ideas, political arguments, spiritual perceptions and a general view point of the world {{that may or may not}} flourish in a foreign nation. [...] Therefore, ideologies spread by cultural diplomacy about the values that American <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> enables those that seek a better life to look towards the Western world where happiness and freedom are portrayed as desirable and achievable goals.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{as well as}} {{attacking the}} {{theories}} of empiricism, Blake also engages {{with the concept of}} natural religion. Northrop Frye argues that [...] "Theology distinguishes between [...] "natural" [...] and [...] "revealed" [...] religion, the former being the vision of God which man develops with his fallen reason, and the later the vision communicated to him by inspired prophets. To Blake, there is no natural religion. The only reason <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> it is because they are unwilling to believe in the identity of God and Man." [...] For Harold Bloom, because Blake is able to see the identity of God and man, the rejection of Locke and the tenets of deism makes way for a system in which [...] "to see the infinite in all things is to see God because it is to see as God sees, which Blake believes {{is the only way to}} see God. But to see as God sees, man must himself be infinite, a state to be attained only by the individual utterly possessed by the Poetic character." [...] Similarly, [...] "there is no natural religion, according to Blake, because no man reasoning from fallen nature can come to see that [...] "the real man, the imagination" [...] and God are the same. Religion must be [...] "revealed" [...] in the sense that Revelation means the consuming of natural appearance by a more imaginative vision." [...] Along these same lines, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi argue that, for Blake, natural religion is a [...] "contradiction in terms antithetical to religious belief. Natural religion is derived from experience provided by the fallen senses, not from the Poetic Genius. Thus it is not a religion and cannot be included in the 'all' of All Religions are One." ...|$|E

50|$|Part of {{the insight}} of the Black Consciousness Movement was in {{understanding}} that black liberation {{would not only}} come from imagining and fighting for structural political changes, as older movements like the ANC did, but also from psychological transformation {{in the minds of}} black people themselves. This analysis suggested that to take power, black <b>people</b> had to <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> the value of their blackness. That is, if black <b>people</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> democracy, but did not <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> their own value, they would not truly be committed to gaining power.|$|R
