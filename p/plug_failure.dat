Plastic flow appeared when joining two aluminium plates by applying a zero amplitude ultrasonic wave (stress amplitude is at a maximum).

The resultant plate was analysed with cross tension test and cross section observation. These results revealed the relation between ultrasonic conditions and cross tensile load. When joining an aluminum plate to various kinds of metal plate, the cross tensile load of the joint reached a maximum value of 200 N.

40|$|Mechanical timber {{connections}} {{can fail}} both in a brittle and a ductile manner {{depending on the}} joint layout. <b>Plug</b> shear <b>failure</b> in nailed timber connections is a brittle failure mode, which shall be avoided in timber structures. This failure mode occurs in nailed connections loaded in tension parallel to the grain, for instance in the lower chord of a timber truss. The failure mode is not described in the Swedish building code of today, {{but there is an}} informative annex in the upcoming Eurocode 5 concerning the subject. In the thesis, <b>plug</b> shear <b>failure</b> is studied and a new prediction model developed based on experimental work on nailed steel-to-timber connections. The experiments were short-term experiments and the effect of long-term conditions is not considered. The total amount of joints tested was 86, which together with results from other researchers formed the base for the prediction model. The stress state and the effect of fastener placement were analysed and showed that <b>plug</b> shear <b>failure</b> is initiated at the nail farthest from the free end of timber. Increased spacing between fasteners lessens the risk for <b>plug</b> shear <b>failure</b> to occur, especially the spacing perpendicular to the grain is important. The prediction model is based on structural mechanics and suggests that the plug shear resistance R = blfv, where b is the joint width, l the joint length and fv the shear strength of wood. The shear strength is determined through fv = KAs- 0. 25, where As = bl and K is a constant. Furthermore, an analysis based on fracture mechanics was performed showing the importance of the softening behaviour of the joint failure. The overall goal with the development of a prediction model is to avoid brittle failures and promote ductile failures. As a tool to promote ductile failures, a measure was developed to aid the designer in designing ductile and strong joints. Recommendations on nail spacing and overall design of the joint are finally given with the aim to avoid <b>plug</b> shear <b>failure.</b> Godkänd; 2004; 20061030 (haneit...|$|R

40|$|As {{the demand}} for {{hydrocarbons}} increases, the oil companies are forced to start {{oil and gas exploration}} in complicated and remote fields. When drilling such environment, the requirement for safety, reliability and operational efficiency of down hole tools is vital. An evaluation of different drill pipe convoyed seal plugs is performed with respect to plug features, benefits,operational procedure and limitations. A comparison based on the different plug design and a review of applications for such plugs is made. Design requirements stated in ISO 14310 :Petroleum and Natural Gas Industries, Downhole Equipment, Packers and Bridge Plugs, is presented and related challenges and technology gaps discussed. An investigation of <b>plug</b> <b>failure</b> and reason for failure between January 2009 and March 2010 is carried out. Normally, down hole seal plugs uses an elastomeric sealing element to provide the seal against the casing wall. The plugs are rated to different temperatures and pressures due to the variation {{in the design of the}} elastomeric sealing element. When operating with elastomers, proper material selection is important to construct a wide performance envelop of the seal,making the seal more flexible with respect to working area. A possible new technology for down hole sealing application is metal-to-metal sealing. Metal-to-metal sealing shows superior seal reliability compared conventional a resilient elastomer seal with respect to pressure and temperature rating. This technology may become the new solution to provide a seal with ahigh integrity level in extreme well environments. This technology is new, and does not meet the requirements stated in ISO 14310. V 0 qualication is required for casing plugs acting as a secondary well barrier used by Statoil. The survey of application utilizing drill pipe convoyed seal plugs shows the most common application for casing suspensions plugs is to act as a secondary well barrier and to provide a gas tight seal for temporary abandonment of the wellbore when pulling the blow out preventer and the marine drilling riser. The present plugs used by Statoil shows good reliability and are efficient in use. However,limitations are seen when operating in extreme wells with difficult well trajectories. An improvement in design on plugs to be used in such wells is to make the plug able to be set and retrieved without rotation, making control of the applied forces on the plug more easily. The investigation of <b>plug</b> <b>failure</b> shows a decrease in failure trend after the implementation of ISO 14310 in 2005. In the time period investigated, a total of 350 plug runs where performed with a recorded failure rate of 9 %. The main reason of failure in this period is pressure test failure of the plug, making up 57 % of the reason of failure. Before the ISO 14310 become operative the main area of failure was when latching on the running/retrieving tool to the plug. </p...|$|E
40|$|Canadian {{hard rock}} mine {{extraction}} practices have commonly created shallow stopes, 12 % {{of which have}} caved to surface, from instabilities originating from stope hangingwalls, crowns or footwalls. To date, however, mine operators have applied few of the available data gathering and design tools {{to strike a balance}} between maximum economic excavation dimension and stope viability. The preference has been to use personal mining experience. Several common rock mass environments are surveyed as well as the various ways in which shallow stopes have failed. It has been found that these rock masses develop gravity-induced movement in the form of plug failures, ravelling of rock blocks, strata failures, chimneying disintegration, and rock mass block caving. New failure-specific analytical equations are developed here for these common failure mechanisms. They address the mechanics of the failure process and incorporate the capability to arrive at the ultimate failure outline, for comparison to the location of the bedrock surface. This research has shown that: plug failures occur along steep, uninterrupted discontinuities bounding large blocks. <b>Plug</b> <b>failure</b> potential reduces substantially with confining compressive stress, discontinuity inclination, the absence of low friction surfaces and shearing of intact rock interrupting the discontinuity. Ravelling requires little peripheral confining stress for stabilization and prevention of block falls or slides. However, inherent conditions such as shallow dipping or vertically dipping joints can cause block falls to develop to surface. Low confining stresses, resulting from multiple stope extraction in orthogonal horizontal directions, would offer conditions suitable for plug and ravelling failures. Strata failures are caused by excessive stope spans, but the limited loading received from above strata is such, that the failure cavity created is of limited vertical extent, some 25 % of the stope width. Chimneying disintegration occurs in weak rock masses with low cohesion, over narrow openings that can be as deep as 275 m. The onset of chimneying disintegration can be created by compressive stresses, but develops as a result of mobilization of the rock mass by gravity in active shear. Block caving requires large spans to develop, and stabilizing could be overcome from arching stresses overcoming bulk arching strength. Controlling instability elements are tabulated for these failure mechanisms. A limit equilibrium correlation between span and cohesion for chimneying disintegration is presented, and the controlling limits between the occurrence of chimneying disintegration and block caving is discussed. Ravelling and chimneying disintegration are the most expected failure mechanisms for shallow stopes of hard rock mines. Although failure of the shallow stope may start around its periphery, stope failure to surface would likely occur in or close to the surface crown pillar. Although the analytical equations developed require input of in situ stresses defined by numerical modelling in order to yield a precise answer, conventional numerical modelling or empirical methods are shown to be unable to predict stope failures as the analytical equations have. A step-by-step stability analysis procedure is presented, incorporating rockmass environment, expected failure mechanism(s), and applicable data gathering and anlytical methods.

40|$|Developed {{fractures}} are {{beneficial for}} the efficient development of tight reservoir. They {{also lead to}} drill-in fluid loss and induce severe formation damage. Fracture plugging with loss control material (LCM) {{is the most common}} way to control drill-in fluid loss in fractured formation. Fracture plugging effect largely depends on the strength of fracture plugging zone, because in most cases <b>plugging</b> <b>failure</b> is caused by the strength <b>failure</b> of <b>plugging</b> zone. However, the effects of LCM mechanical and geometric parameters on plugging zone strength are still unclear. Moreover, traditional LCM selection is mainly performed by trial-and-error method, {{due to the lack of}} mathematical models. This paper develops an analytical model for plugging zone strength accounting for the frictional failure and shear <b>failure</b> of fracture <b>plugging</b> zone. Effects of LCM mechanical and geometric properties on plugging zone strength are analyzed. The proposed model is validated by laboratory data. Application procedure of the proposed model to drill-in fluid loss control is developed and successfully applied to the field case study in Sichuan basin, China. The modelling results show that particle-particle friction angle, particle-fiber friction angle, fiber tensile strength, D 90 degradation rate, and friction angle between plugging zone and fracture surface are main mechanical parameters affecting the plugging zone strength. Particle size distribution, aspect ratio and initial angle of fiber, and plugging zone porosity are main geometric parameters during loss control. Single LCM parameters are applied to the selection of LCM type. Plugging zone parameters are used for the determination of optimal LCM concentration. Reasonable combination of rigid granule, fiber and elastic particle can create a synergy effect to optimize the plugging zone strength and loss control effect.

40|$|In the {{petroleum}} industry, {{growing number of}} projects that involve harsh downhole conditions {{in one hand and}} increasing restrictions and safety requirements in other hand, have been the key driving factors for improving downhole tools. In this context pressure isolation tools, due to their profound impact on safety and efficiency of broad range of downhole operations, have been given special attention in the recent years. Many research and developments have been carried out to improve performance of these devices. While some of these activities are focused on refining existing technologies, others consist of radically new approaches. In this master thesis existing technologies related to downhole pressure isolation devices are initially investigated and heir advantages and shortcomings are identified. Furthermore; with the aim of identifying potentials for developing a new design, number of most relevant patents and technologies are explored. Finally a novel design based on existing technologies and recent patents is developed and presented. From investigation of <b>plug</b> operational <b>failure</b> rates from 1999 to 2012 it is observed that while number of plug runs has more than doubled, the failure rate has dropped from 30 % in 1999 to approximately 12 % in 2012. Developments in plug design and improvements in deployment methods over the years have played a significant part in this reduction. At present state, wellbore debris is acknowledged to be a major concern. According to the Statoil evaluation 72 % of <b>plug</b> <b>failures</b> are either directly or indirectly triggered by debris in well. Another source of limitations and failures, especially in high pressure high temperature wells, is identified to be associated with elastomer sealing elements. To mitigate the problems associated with current technology, a new design based on metal to metal seals in combination with semisolid metal processing technology and expanding characteristic of Bismuth is developed and presented in the final stage of this thesis. Metal to metal seals have number of advantages over the traditional elastomer seals. However, because of the limitations caused by their design, establishing a satisfactory metal to metal seal at required microscopic level to provide a gas thigh seal is found to be challenging. To take advantage of metal to metal seal to overcome the limitations faced by traditional sealing technology {{and at the same time}} guarantee formation of metallic gas tight seal at microscopic level, a secondary sealing element is considered in the suggested design. In addition to the main design two alternative modifications are also included. Inclusion of the alternative designs is intended to broaden the application of the suggested plug. This is achieved by initially investigating the stress distribution at the seal?s contact surfaces with tubing as the result of its geometry and subsequently providing an alternative geometry profile that could improve the plug performance in certain downhole conditions. In another alternative method expansion of Bismuth upon solidification was used for a creating self-energizing seal. Finally to improve the possible applications of the suggested design several future work are recommended. Followings are the most important ones among these recommendations: ? A research study to identify a most suitable material that has expanding characteristics and is suitable for wide range of downhole conditions. ? A research study for identifying a modification of the suggested design to suit multiset applications. </p...|$|R

The rate and pressure sensitivity of PMMA are characterized over a range of strain rates of 143 s 1010 − − −=ε &. In the quasi static regime, the material is quite ductile, exhibiting noticeable barreling.

Typically, ballistic composites show material specific deformation and failure phenomena during ballistic impact. Besides elastic-plastic deformation, shear <b>plugging</b> and <b>failure</b> of matrice and/or fibers, delamination of layers are on of the most important energy absorption mechanisms. The degree of delamination defines the amount of energy absorbed and the shape of back face bulge of the target. The back face bulge must be predicted throroughly, particularly for components close to the body, such as vests and helmets. The most common experimental technique for determining the fracture toughness is the Double Cantilever Beam test (DCB). Typically, tests are carried out using standardized DCB specimens. However, as will be shown in this paper, the standard test method is not suitable for measuring the mode I fracture toughness of UHMW-PE composites. If the standard test procedure is followed, the cantilever portions of the DCB specimen break due to the relatively low bending stiffness of the material. For this reason, several modifications to the standard test setup were tested and evaluated for their potential to produce reliable mode I fracture toughness data. This paper presents a discussion on the advantages and limitations of the different test setups.

Amongst the challenges in simulation is the capturing of target plate material behaviour at high strain rates with possibilities of adiabatic heating.

Mesh density and element type, contact condition, and constitutive model 9 I. e. discrete strain-rate based, Cowper-Symonds, or Johnson-Cook) with failure criteria are verifiable and greatly beneficial for armour plate design. Confidence in the suggested procedures has been obtained through extensive correlation of numerical results with experimental residual velocities and ballistic limits as well as projectile and target plate failure modes. A wide range of impact velocities has been considered (from a low velocity of about 5 m/s to an ordnance range velocity of 800 + m/s). Target plates made of variants of mild steel and aluminium alloys have been studied. The simulation approaches have been applied to single-layered as well as multi-layered target plates. Although a majority of the comparisons has been made against published test results, a new ballistic impact testing facility has been set up in course of the current research and excellent correlation of numerically predicted residual velocities and failure modes has been obtained against the tests carried out for aluminium plate using the latter facility. A unique feature of the current experimental effort is the capturing of the complete trajectory of projectile beginning with oblique impact through subsequent perforation/ricochet. Furthermore, projectiles of various nose-shapes such as ogival, conical, hemispherical and blunt have been employed. The power of simulation has been demonstrated {{with the help of a}} number of parametric studies with variables such as plate thickness and material properties, as well as projectile mass and diameter, and obtaining physically consistent results.

During the ballistic impact event, energy lost by the projectile is absorbed by the fabric target through various damage and energy absorbing mechanisms such as compression of the fabric target directly below the projectile, compression in the region surrounding the impacted zone, shear plugging, stretching and tensile failure of yarns/layers in the region consisting of primary yarns, tensile deformation of yarns/layers in the region consisting of secondary yarns, conical deformation on the back face of the fabric target, in-plane friction between the warp and fill yarns and through the thickness friction between the moving projectile and the fabric target. The formulation presented considers both shear <b>plugging</b> and tensile <b>failure</b> of yarns during conical deformation and is valid {{for a wide range}} of fabric target thicknesses. Solution procedure for the evaluation of ballistic impact performance is presented. Further, experimental results are presented for the validation of analytical predictions. A good match is observed between the analytical predictions and the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{intricate}} problems in terminal ballistics is the physics underlying penetration and perforation. Several penetration modes are well identified, such as petalling, <b>plugging,</b> spall <b>failure</b> and fragmentation (Sedgwick, 1968). In most cases, the final target failure will combine those modes. Some of the failure modes can be due to brittle material behavior, but penetration of ductile targets by blunt projectiles, involving plugging in particular, is caused by excessive localized plasticity, with emphasis on adiabatic shear banding (ASB). Among the theories regarding the onset of ASB, new evidence was recently brought by Rittel et al. (2006), according to whom shear bands initiate {{as a result of}} dynamic recrystallization (DRX), a local softening mechanism driven by the stored energy of cold work. As such, ASB formation results from microstructural transformations, rather than from thermal softening. In our previous work (Dolinski et al., 2010), a failure criterion based on plastic strain energy density was presented and applied to model four different classical examples of dynamic failure involving ASB formation. According to this criterion, a material point starts to fail when the total plastic strain energy density reaches a critical value. Thereafter, the strength of the element decreases gradually to zero to mimic the actual material mechanical behavior. The goal {{of this paper is to}} present a new combined experimental-numerical study of ballistic penetration and perforation, using the above-mentioned failure criterion. Careful experiments are carried out using a single combination of AISI 4340 FSP projectiles and 25 [mm] thick RHA steel plates, while the impact velocity, and hence the imparted damage, are systematically varied. We show that our failure model, which includes only one adjustable parameter in this present work, can faithfully reproduce each of the experiments without any further adjustment. Moreover, it is shown that the most common failure criterion based on a critical strain is simply inadequate to reproduce the results, due to the linear nature of the damage evolution. The advantages of the energy-based failure criterion are discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|A {{generalized}} analytical formulation {{is presented}} for {{the prediction of}} ballistic impact behavior of 2 D woven fabric composite laminates impacted with a rigid cylindrical projectile. The formulation is valid {{for a wide range}} of laminate thicknesses. The formulation is based on stress wave propagation and energy balance between the projectile and the composite target. During the ballistic impact event, the energy lost by the projectile is absorbed by the target through various damage and energy absorbing mechanisms such as compression of the target directly below the projectile, compression in the region surrounding the impacted zone, shear plugging, stretching and tensile failure of yarns/layers in the region consisting of primary yarns, tensile deformation of yarns/layers in the region consisting of secondary yarns, conical deformation on the back face of the target, delamination, matrix cracking, and friction between the projectile and the target.

40|$|Ballistic impact {{performance}} of structures made of polymer matrix composites is presented. During the ballistic impact event, the energy lost by the projectile is {{absorbed by the}} composite target through various energy absorbing mechanisms. Compression of the target directly below the projectile, compression in the region surrounding the impacted zone, stretching and tensile failure of yarns/layers in the region consisting of primary yarns, tensile deformation of yarns/layers in the region consisting of secondary yarns, delamination, matrix cracking and friction between the projectile and the target are the energy absorbing mechanisms. Additionally, conical deformation on the back face of the target and energy absorbed by the moving cone is the special feature of thin composites whereas energy absorbed by shear plugging of the target is the special feature of thick composites. In the present studies, a generalized approach is used and both shear <b>plugging</b> and tensile <b>failure</b> during conical deformation are considered. The generalized approach used is valid {{for a wide range}} of laminate thicknesses. Based on the generalized approach, {{performance of}} typical 2 D plain weave fabric composites has been presented in this study. Ballistic impact experiments were performed to validate the analytical predictions. The analytical predictions of ballistic limit velocity and plug dimension are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. Energy absorbed by various mechanisms and variation of projectile velocity and kinetic energy are presented as a function of time. Further, ballistic limit velocity as a function of target thickness has been evaluated. The results obtained show that the ballistic limit velocity increases with the increase in target thickness initially, then remains nearly constant over a range of target thickness. With further increase in target thickness, the ballistic limit velocity increases...|$|R
40|$|Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), {{working for}} the United States Department of Energy (DOE), has {{conducted}} a preliminary evaluation of the potential of very low fuel input capacity Simplex type pressure atomizing nozzles for use with oil burners designed for residential boilers, furnaces and water heaters. These nozzles under suitable conditions can be sufficiently reliable to enable new heating system designs. This would allow {{for the design of}} heating appliances that match the smaller load demands of energy efficient homes built with modern components and architectural systems designed to minimize energy use. When heating systems are installed with excessive capacity, oversized by three to four times the load, the result is a loss of up to ten percent as compared to the rated appliance efficiency. The use of low capacity nozzles in systems designed to closely match the load can thereby result in significant energy savings. BNL investigated the limitations of low flow rate nozzles and designed long-term experiments to see if ways could be determined that would be beneficial to long-term operation at low input capacities without failures. In order to maximize the potential for success the best possible industry practices available were employed. Low flow rate nozzles primarily fail by blockage or partial blockage of internal fuel flow passages inside the nozzle. To prevent any contaminants from entering the nozzle BNL investigated the geometry and critical dimensions and the current sate of the art of fuel filter design. Based on this investigation it was concluded that the best available filters should be more than capable of filtering contaminants from the fuel prior to entering the oil burner itself. This position was indeed validated based on the long-term trials conducted under this study no evidence resulted to change our position. It is highly recommended that these filters rated at 10 microns and with large filter capacity (surface area), should be used with all oil burner installations. The other possible failure mode had been attributed to fuel degradation and this became the main focus of the evaluation. The degradation of fuel usually occurs faster under higher temperature conditions. To preclude this as much as possible controls that provided for a post-purge of combustion airflow after burner shut down were selected. This provided {{a short period of time}} where the burner's combustion air blower continues to operate after the flame has gone out. This tends to cool the nozzle and in turn the fuel inside the small flow pathways inside the nozzle components. This study concludes that the use of low capacity nozzles is possible but only when the temperature and thermal mass environment of the combustion chamber result in a relatively ''cool'' condition. This was accomplished in one long-term experiment that essentially operated for a full heating season equivalent with no evidence of nozzle <b>plugging</b> or <b>failure.</b> The nozzle body surface temperature was kept at or below 150 F during the duration of the trial. On the other hand, a second system was studied that ended in a partial nozzle blockage and a system failure. In this ''hot environment'' system the nozzle body temperature reached 210 F. This occurred at close to a full heating season equivalent, yet it still would have resulted in a no-heat complaint by the homeowner...|$|R
40|$|Steam {{assisted}} gravity-drainage (SAGD) is {{a method}} to produce bitumen or extra-heavy oil by injecting steam into the reservoir. The steam lowers the viscosity and the mixture of oil and water are then able to flow through production well. After separating produced water and oil, the water is recycled to the steam generation system for economic and environmental reasons. The water then goes through treatment processes, and it is used in a once-through steam generator (OTSG) with additional water (makeup water) to produce steam for the SAGD injectors. At {{high pressure and temperature}} conditions, hard scales are formed on the inside surface of the boiler tubes. The fuel consumption increases as the scales decrease the thermal efficiency. The scale build-up might lead to <b>plugging</b> and boiler <b>failure.</b> The objectives of this study are to 1) investigate the compositions of four different silica scales from SAGD boilers, 2) study the effect of different treatment solutions on the solubility of those silica scales, and 3) examine the effect of temperature on the working mechanisms of those solutions to find the most efficient formulation to dissolve the problematic scales. Four different scale samples from SAGD boilers were analyzed to determine an effective and compatible solution to dissolve them. After removing organic matter by using xylene, the mineralogy of these samples was analyzed by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) before applying any treatment method. The dissolution tests were conducted with four different chemical solutions: 1) preflush with 15 wt% HCl followed by main acid treatment with 9 : 1 wt% HCl-HF solution, 2) preflush with 10 wt% NaGLDA followed by main acid treatment with 10 : 1 wt% NaGLDA-HF solution, 3) preflush with 9 wt% formic acid followed by main acid treatment with 9 : 1 wt% formic acid-HF solution, and 4) 5 wt% KOH solution. Tests were run at 77 and 300 ?F for three hours. The ion concentrations in the filtrates were analyzed by using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) after all dissolution tests. Furthermore, solubility values also helped to draw a conclusion about compatibility of solution sets with scale samples by running dissolution tests. The HCl treatment set (preflush with 10 wt% HCl followed by main acid treatment with 9 : 1 wt% HCl-HF solution) was the most effective solution at 77 and 300 ?F in terms of high total dissolved scale forming ions in solution and high solubility values...|$|R
40|$|Laminated bamboo {{could be}} a {{promising}} material {{when it comes to}} large span roofing structures where often truss structures are adopted. It is assumed that connection design used for timber trusses can also be applied in laminated bamboo trusses. For this research truss nodes with slotted-in steel plates are considered. This research will focus itself on the effect of using multiple fasteners in a row in laminated bamboo connections with a single slotted-in steel plate. As a starting point, the possible failure modes and methods for predicting the load-bearing capacity of a single fastener timber connection are assumed to be also applicable to laminated bamboo. Timber can show ductile and brittle failure modes. Ductile failure modes are described by the European Yield Model (EYM) which was first published by Johansen in 1949. Three different failure modes can be distinguished in the EYM, where mode 1 represents pure embedment failure, mode 2 is failure due to one plastic hinge in the fastener per shear plane and mode 3 shows two plastic hinges per shear plane. The brittle failure modes that can be distinguished are splitting, shear <b>plug,</b> tension <b>failure</b> of the net section and group tear-out. The capacity of a multiple fastener connection might not equal the capacity of a single fastener connection multiplied by the number of fasteners. The main parameters that might influence the load-carrying capacity of multiple fastener joints are the inaccuracies in manufacturing, fastener spacing and end distances, dowel slenderness ratio and the plastic behaviour of the fastener. The testing methods for determining the strength en deformation characteristics of laterally loaded connections with dowels in load-bearing timber structures are used for this research. The objective is to study the influence of the number of fasteners in one row on the load carrying capacity of a steel to laminated bamboo connection. The design of the test pieces is based on the European Yield Model (EYM) where three different failure modes can be distinguished. In order to accomplish this, 9 test series are performed with a variation in the number of fasteners in one row (i. e. 1, 2 and 3) and a variation in thickness of the laminated bamboo members (i. e. 15 mm, 43 mm and 90 mm). The test results show that laminated bamboo connections with a slotted-in steel plate and thin bamboo members have limited deformation capacity and tend to show premature brittle failure due to a shear plug. A clear plastic branch in the load slip diagram of the test series where a single fastener and a member thickness of 15 mm is used, indicates that there is some amount of embedment prior to fracture. In case of two dowels in a row this plastic branch shortens and in case of three dowels in a row no plastic behaviour was observed. The limited deformation capacity of these type of joints (especially when multiple dowels in a row are used) makes the applicability of the EYM for a laminated bamboo connection where failure mode 1 is governing questionable. Plastic hinges did develop in the dowels in the test variants where failure mode 2 and 3 was expected. the EYM can quite accurately predict the capacity of a double shear laminated bamboo joint with a central steel plate where the dowel slenderness ratio is sufficient to achieve failure mode 2 or 3. The effective number of fasteners in a laminated bamboo connection was found to be higher than predicted with the equation given in EC 5 irrespective of the observed failure mode. It is because of the decrease in deformation capacity that the load per dowel in a multiple fastener connection is lower than in a connection with a single fastener. The nef for laminated bamboo and several wood species was found {{to be in the same}} order of magnitude for a connection with three dowels in a row. The joint stiffness per dowel of a laminated bamboo connection with a slotted-in steel plate was found to decrease with increasing number of fasteners in a row. It also seems that the joint stiffness is higher in case of failure mode 2 and 3 than in case of failure mode 1. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesStructural Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Reinforced Concrete (RC) is an {{important}} material in civil construction projects, and rigorous standards exist for rating the structural, wind, vibration, and cyclic design loads. In narrower applications, such as the design of protective saferooms, RC is also designed to bear impact loads which may be applied repeatedly. Although current experimental and computational methods allow for prediction of concrete damage from a single impact, there is no attempted study of damage progression from repeated impacts. Such a study is attempted on a well-defined slab impact test used in the rating of protection provided by RC walls. Multiple projectiles impact a chosen location and accumulating damage is predicted by means of numerical simulation. The simulation results are then correlated to an experimental test demonstrating similar effects. The classic projectile impact problem is taken {{as the basis for}} computational analysis. Nonlinear wood and concrete material models are substituted for the conventional steel projectile and target, and a damage variable is defined to track cumulative effects of plastic strain. The simulation is then extended to additional impacts while preserving the damaged state of the slab. The development of damage and accumulating strain energy is computed, until damage extends throughout the entire thickness of the slab. Since the contact period per impact is estimated to be under a millisecond, an explicit dynamics formulation of the problem is implemented in commercial software LS-DYNA. The concrete stresses are computed using the Reidel-Hermaier-Thoma Model (RHT), which incorporates a smooth geologic cap model to provide a single continuous failure surface. In this manner, compaction, shear and tensile failures are represented, and consolidated for post-processing by means of a single damage variable. To verify computational predictions, the impact is recreated experimentally. A set of wood projectiles and RC slabs are fabricated, to allow for repeatable tests. Initial and boundary conditions are recreated by means of a steel bracket for the slab and an air cannon for the projectile. After initial calibration, a repeatable projectile speed, impact location and momentum transfer is achieved. The slabs are impacted repeatedly until macroscopic damage is clearly visible on the front and back faces of the slab. Damaged slabs are then cross-sectioned for material failures and plastic deformation. The simulations and experimental tests show consistency in predicting the progression of damage in RC slabs. In both cases, through-thickness failure was achieved in 2 - 4 impacts, depending on the initial kinetic energy of the projectile. Initial damage began as subsurface shear cracking, and in later impacts tensile <b>failures,</b> shear <b>failure</b> (<b>plug</b> formation) and compaction (pulverization) developed concurrently. Granted further verification is performed, there is a promising possibility that these methods and results could be used to provide safety ratings for structures designed to withstand multiple impacts, and to re-asses load ratings of damaged structures more accurately...|$|R
