40|$|Auxetic {{materials}} are of great engineering interest {{not only because}} of their fascinating negative Poisson's ratio, but also due to their increased toughness and indentation resistance. These {{materials are}} typically synthesized <b>polyester</b> <b>foams</b> with a very heterogeneous structure, but the role of disorder in auxetic behavior is not fully understood. Here, we provide a systematic theoretical and experimental investigation in to the effect of disorder on the mechanical properties of a paradigmatic auxetic lattice with a re-entrant hexagonal geometry. We show that disorder has a marginal effect on the Poisson's ratio unless the lattice topology is altered, and in all cases examined the disorder preserves the auxetic characteristics. Depending on the direction of loading applied to these disordered auxetic lattices, either brittle or ductile failure is observed. It is found that brittle failure is associated with a disorder-dependent tensile strength, whereas in ductile failure disorder does not affect strength. Our work thus provides general guidelines to optimize elasticity and strength of disordered auxetic metamaterials. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

Three grid-domed textile composites fabricated from knitted fabrics were studied under quasi-static compression and impact condition. In both cases, the energy-absorbing capacity of the samples was measured. Comparison was made between the grid-domed composites, a composite comprising a non-woven fabric preform, <b>polyester</b> and polyethylene <b>foams.</b> The grid-domed composites exhibiting plastic collapses showed high levels of optimum specific energy-absorbing capacity at higher pressure levels than those of <b>polyester</b> and polyethylene <b>foams.</b> In addition, increases in strain rate or relative density had a positive effect on the energy-absorption capacity. The major energy-absorption mechanism of the grid-domed composite samples was identified as the plastic collapse of both the spherical cap and the truncated conical shell. Accordingly, a three-stage theoretical model is proposed; and the prediction of the energy-absorbing capacity of these cellular textile composites is in good agreement with experimental results.
