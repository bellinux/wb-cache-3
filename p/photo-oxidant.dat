Chemical and {{meteorological}} observation data were used to validate the model, and results suggest that the WRF-Chem model can capture {{the effects of}} the total solar eclipse well. The maximum impacts of the eclipse occur over the area of totality, with a decrease in surface temperature of 1. 5 °C and decrease in wind speed of 1 m s− 1 . In contrast, the maximum impacts on atmospheric pollutants occur over parts of north and east China where emissions are greater, with an increase of 5 ppbv in NO 2 and 25 ppbv in CO and a decrease of 10 ppbv in O 3 and 3 ppbv in NO.

Although the sun was obscured to a smaller extent in polluted areas than in clean areas, the impacts of the eclipse in polluted areas are greater and last longer than they do in clean areas. The change in radical concentrations during the eclipse reveals that nighttime chemistry dominates in both polluted and clean areas. In contrast to the effects on atmospheric pollutants, the change in radical concentrations (OH, HO 2 and NO 3 in clean areas is much larger than in polluted areas mainly because of the limited sources of radicals in these areas.

Nonetheless, the environmental profile of the electricity production from rice husk must be assessed to ensure reduced environmental damage. A 10 MW pilot plant using rice husk as feedstock is the study site. The environmental impacts from rice husk power plant are evaluated by using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. Energy, material and carbon balances have been determined for tracing the system flow. Carbon closure has been used for describing of the net amount of CO 2 released from the system in relation to the amount being recycled between the power plant and the CO 2 adsorbed by rice husk. The transportation of rice husk to the power plant has significant on global warming, but not on acidification and <b>photo-oxidant</b> formation. The results showed that the impact potentials from rice husk power plant are lesser than the conventional plants for most of the categories considered; except the <b>photo-oxidant</b> formation potential from CO. The high CO from rice husk power plant may be due to low boiler efficiency and high moisture content in rice husk.

The ET activity of Cuα 3 D-CH 3 was determined using five different photosensitizers. By exhibiting a complete depletion of the <b>photo-oxidant</b> and the successive formation of a Cu(II) species at 400 nm, the transient and generated spectra demonstrated an ET transfer reaction between the <b>photo-oxidant</b> and Cu(I) α 3 D-CH 3. This observation illustrated our success in integrating an ET center within a de novo designed scaffold. From the kinetic traces at 400 nm, first-order and bimolecular rate constants of 10 (5) s(- 1) and 10 (8) M(- 1) s(- 1) were derived.

The method {{is applied to}} emission, consumption and production data of the Flemish industry provided by the Flemish environmental agency for the period 1995 - 2006. For climate change, acidification, <b>photo-oxidant</b> formation, human toxicity, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity and eutrophication, the eco-efficiency improved by 39, 55, 41, 58, 72 and 53 %, respectively. For each of these impact categories, the total environmental impact decreased despite an increase in production, indicating absolute decoupling of environmental impact from economic growth. The eco-efficiency indicator for energy consumption and waste generation improved by 16 and 14 %, respectively. However, due {{to the increase in}} production, the total energy consumption and the amount of waste generated increased: for these two environmental themes decoupling from economic growth was relative. Despite the improved eco-efficiency, industry remains one of the main polluters in Flanders. The application of the method to emission, energy consumption and production data of the Flemish industry resulted in a comprehensive and correct source of information for the general public and the government.

ArcelorMittal Gent, an integrated steelwork producing ca. 5 x 10 (6) tons of steel per year, not only decreased its specific energy consumption and CO 2 -emissions, but also reduced {{the environmental impact of}} its other emissions. This is illustrated by means of the evolution of 6 partial eco-efficiency indicators for the impact categories acidification, <b>photo-oxidant</b> formation, human toxicity, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, eutrophication and water use. The partial eco-efficiency indicators are eco-intensities, defined as the environmental impact in the respective impact category, divided by the amount of liquid steel produced. In the period 1995 - 2005 these indicators decreased by 45, 4, 52, 9, 11 and 33 % respectively, whereas the steel production increased by 17 %. The net impact of discharges of wastewater is negligible for human toxicity and is negative (concentrations lower than in the canal water used) for freshwater aquatic toxicity and eutrophication. For acidification, human toxicity (only emissions to air) and water use, the decoupling between environmental impact and production was absolute; for <b>photo-oxidant</b> formation, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity (only emissions to air) and eutrophication, it was relative.

40|$|A model {{environment}} has been established, which allows an {{estimation of the}} influence of global climate change on the chemistry of the polluted atmosphere over Europe. For this purpose the regional chemistry-transport-model of the EURAD-System has been modified and made adaptable for input data from a regional climate model, which is nested in a global atmospheric circulation model. Thus, the dynamical aspect of a possible global temperature increase as well as enhanced water vapour concentrations and background concentrations of carbon monoxide and methane can be considered. By substituting the meteorological driver model in main problems arise from different vertical grids and physical parameterization schemes. In particular the parameterization of cloud processes has to be checked to avoid inconsistencies between the chemistry-transport-model and its meteorological driver model. As the length of a simulation period is mainly limited by the large amount of computer time spent for the determination of chemical transformation rates, the gas phase chemistry module has been optimized concerning computer time and numerical stability.

40|$|Background: Multiple-stranded DNA assemblies, encoded by sequence, {{have been}} {{constructed}} {{in an effort to}} self-assemble nanodevices of defined molecular architecture. Double-helical DNA has been probed also as a molecular medium for charge transport. Conductivity studies suggest that DNA displays semiconductor properties, whereas biochemical studies have shown that oxidative damage to B-DNA at the 5 ′-G of a 5 ′-GG- 3 ′ doublet can occur by charge transport through DNA up to 20 nm from a photo-excited metallointercalator. The possible application of DNA assemblies, in particular double crossover (DX) molecules, in electrical nanodevices prompted the design of a DNA DX assembly with oxidatively sensitive guanine moieties and a tethered rhodium <b>photo-oxidant</b> strategically placed to probe charge transport. Results: DX assemblies support long-range charge transport selectively down the base stack bearing the intercalated <b>photo-oxidant.</b> Despite tight packing, no electron transfer (ET) crossover to the adjacent base stack is observed. Moreover, the base stack of a DX assembly is well-coupled and less susceptible than duplex DNA to stacking perturbations. Introducing a double mismatch along the path for charge transport entirely disrupts long-range ET in duplex DNA, but only marginally decreases it in the analogous stack within DX molecules. Conclusions: The path for charge transport in a DX DNA assembly is determined directly by base stacking. As a result, the two closely packed stacks within this assembly are electronically insulated from one another. Therefore, DX DNA assemblies may serve as robust, insulated conduits for charge transport in nanoscale devices...|$|E

The episode was characterized by three consecutive peaks. The first one was the highest (over 120 ppbv), and it occurred at the late night on 17 July. Following two (both about 110 ppbv) appeared approximately 18 and 36 hours after the first peak, respectively. The night-time maximum and the departure from the usual diurnal variation of ozone concentration during investigated episode point to the non-local pollution sources, rather than to local photochemical production. Thus, recorded ozone peaks might arise due to the long-range transport of photo-oxidants; 2) stratospheric ozone intrusion; or 3) they {{might be result of}} both (1) and (2).

40|$|The {{emission}} {{rate of the}} volatile reactive compound isoprene, emitted predominantly by trees, must be known before the level of <b>photo-oxidants</b> produced during summer smog can be predicted reliably. The emission is dependent on plant species and local conditions, and these dependencies must be quantified {{to be included in}} any empirical algorithm for the calculation of isoprene production. Experimental measurements of isoprene {{emission rate}}s are expensive, however, and existing data are scarce and fragmentary. To overcome these difficulties, it is promising to develop a numerical model capable of precisely calculating the isoprene emission by trees for diverse ecosystems, even under changing environmental conditions. A basic process-based biochemical isoprene emission model (BIM) has therefore been developed, which describes the enzymatic reactions in leaf chloroplasts leading to the formation of isoprene under varying environmental conditions (e. g. light intensity, temperature). Concentrations of the precursors of isoprene formation, 3 -phosphoglyceric acid and glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate, are provided by a published light fleck photosynthesis model. Specific leaf and enzyme parameters were determined for the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.), so that the BIM is capable of calculating oak-specific isoprene emission rates as influenced by the leaf temperature and light intensity. High correlation was observed between isoprene emission rates calculated by the BIM and the diurnal isoprene emission rates of leaves measured under controlled environmental conditions.

40|$|In {{most modern}} waste {{incinerators}} selective non catalytic reduction (SNCR) {{is applied to}} remove NOx from the combustion gas to reach the European emission limit value (ELV) of 200 mg/Nm³. If however the NOx-ELV for waste incinerators would be lowered to e. g. 100 mg /Nm³, SNCR, with a typical NOx removal efficiency of around 50 %, would not suffice to reach the new ELV. In that case, selective catalytic reduction (SCR), with a NOx removal efficiency of up to 90 % in tail-end configuration could be an interesting alternative. However, from a life cycle perspective, the production, construction and operation of SCR equipment including the catalyst, also involve indirect (i. e. not from the process itself but related {{to other parts of}} the life-cycle) pollutant emissions and resource consumption with resulting environmental impacts. By means of a case study of a typical hazardous waste incinerator it is illustrated that replacing SNCR by tail-end SCR reduces the direct environmental impact of the incinerator (i. e. environmental impact of the NOx emitted at the stack) in the impact categories acidification, eutrophication and <b>photo-oxidant</b> formation, as expected from the lower NOx emissions in case of SCR. However, mainly due to the need to reheat the combustion gas, SCR has higher indirect impacts than SNCR, most notably in the impact category global warming. Because of these indirect impacts, the mentioned direct environmental impact reductions of SCR in the impact categories acidification, eutrophication and <b>photo-oxidant</b> formation are no net environmental benefits; when e. g. fuel oil is used as an energy source to reheat the flue gas, the indirect impact in the impact categories acidification and <b>photo-oxidant</b> formation is higher than the direct impact reduction related to the lower NOx concentration in the flue gas emitted at the stack of the installation. In this case, there is only a net environmental benefit in the impact category eutrophication. Overall it can be concluded that in the hazardous waste incinerator under study, which is representative in its field, replacing SNCR by SCR to reach a new, lower ELV, increases the net overall environmental impact of the incinerator, particularly in the impact category global warming. From an environmental point of view optimizing existing SNCR should be preferred over installing tail-end SCR for existing installations such as the considered hazardous waste incinerator. status: publishe...|$|E

For example, sawmilling sector is {{the backbone of the}} wood based industry in Malaysia. A study by Ramasamy et al. (2015) on the environmental impact of sawmilling industry concluded that several gases such as CO 2, CH 4, NOx, N 2 O, SO 2, and CO were found discharged into the environment and the impacts were found in the form of global warming, acidification, human toxicity, eutrophication, and <b>photo-oxidant</b> formation in Malaysia.|$|E
40|$|Rhodium(III) polypyridine {{complexes}} {{and their}} cyclometalated analogues display photophysical properties of considerable interest, both from a fundamental viewpoint {{and in terms}} of the possible applications. In mononuclear polypyridine complexes, the photophysics and photochemistry are determined by the interplay between LC and MC excited states, with relative energies depending critically on the metal coordination environment. In cyclometalated complexes, the covalent character of the C – Rh bonds makes the lowest excited state classification less clear cut, with strong mixing of LC, MLCT, and LLCT character being usually observed. In redox reactions, Rh(III) polypyridine units can behave as good electron acceptors and strong <b>photo-oxidants.</b> These properties are exploited in polynuclear complexes and supramolecular systems containing these units. In particular, Ru(II) -Rh(III) dyads have been actively investigated for the study of photoinduced electron transfer, with specific interest in driving force, distance, and bridging ligand effects. Among systems of higher nuclearity undergoing photoinduced electron transfer, of particular interest are polynuclear complexes where rhodium dihalo polypyridine units, thanks to their Rh(III) /Rh(I) redox behavior, can act as twoelectron storage components. A large amount of work has been devoted to the use of Rh(III) polypyridine complexes as intercalators for DNA. In this role, they have proven to be very versatile, being used for direct strand photocleavage marking the site of intercalation, to induce long-distance photochemical damage or dimer repair, or to act as electron acceptors in long-range electron transfer processes...|$|R
40|$|Organic sunscreens may {{decrease}} their protective {{capability and}} also behave as <b>photo-oxidants</b> upon ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure. The present {{study investigated the}} effect of a cream gel formulation containing the UV filters benzophenone- 3, octyl methoxycinnamate, and octyl salicylate on skin superoxide dismutase (SOD) after a single dose of UVR (2. 87 J/cm(2)). The retention of these UV filters was first evaluated in vivo using hairless mice to guarantee the presence of the filters in the skin layers at the moment of irradiation. The in vivo effect of the UV filters on skin SOD was then assayed spectrophotometrically via the reduction of cytochrome c. The cream gel formulation promoted the penetration of the three UV filters into the epidermis and the dermis at one hour post-application. A significant decrease in SOD activity was observed in irradiated animals treated with sunscreen formulation. However, no effect on SOD activity in skin was observed by the isolated presence of the sunscreens, the formulation components, or the exposure to UVR. The sunscreens may have formed degradation products under UVR that may have either inhibited the enzyme or generated reactive species in the skin. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|The Meteorological Synthesizing Centre-West (MSC-W) of the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) {{has been}} {{performing}} model calculations {{in support of}} the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) for more than 30 years. The EMEP MSC-W chemical transport model {{is still one of the}} key tools within European air pollution policy assessments. Traditionally, the model has covered all of Europe with a resolution of about 50 km × 50 km, and extending vertically from ground level to the tropopause (100 hPa). The model has changed extensively over the last ten years, however, with flexible processing of chemical schemes, meteorological inputs, and with nesting capability: the code is now applied on scales ranging from local (ca. 5 km grid size) to global (with 1 degree resolution). The model is used to simulate <b>photo-oxidants</b> and both inorganic and organic aerosols. In 2008 the EMEP model was released for the first time as public domain code, along with all required input data for model runs for one year. The second release of the EMEP MSC-W model became available in mid 2011, and a new release is targeted for summer 2012. This publication is intended to document this third release of the EMEP MSC-W model. The model formulations are given, along with details of input data-sets which are used, and a brief background on some of the choices made in the formulation is presented. The model code itself is available at www. emep. int, along with the data required to run for a full year over Europe. ...|$|R
