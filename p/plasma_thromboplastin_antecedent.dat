The platelet reactant contributes at least two factors active in this test: a protein-linked phospholipid, and accelerator globulin (AcG), the latter probably having been adsorbed from plasma. The antihemophilic factor, supplied as aluminum hydroxide- or barium sulfate-adsorbed plasma, is accompanied by at least three other factors: accelerator globulin (AcG), <b>plasma</b> <b>thromboplastin</b> <b>antecedent</b> (PTA) 3 and Hageman factor. ’ It may also contain inhibitors.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of a coagulation factor to the enzymatic cascade {{known as the}} intrinsic coagulation pathway is dependent upon its rate of activation {{and the rate of}} destruction of the activated enzyme. Considerable progress has recently been made in our understanding of the mechanism of activation and inhibition of coagulation Factor XI or partial <b>thromboplastin</b> <b>antecedent</b> (PTA). 1 Activation of the precursor form (Pre-PTA) is dependent upon contact activation of Hageman factor (1) as well as upon a feedback mechanism in which a second Hageman factor substrate, prekallikrein, is activated to kallikrein (2) which in turn further activates Hageman factor (3). In the absence of this intrinsic control (Fletcher factor or prekallikrein deficiency) (4), the rate of activation of Hageman factor and, in turn, pre-PTA is diminished (5). Once activated, PTA is known to be inhibited by the inhibitor of the activated first component of complement (CT INH) (6) as well as by antithrombin III (7). In this manuscript we describe a method for the purification of pre-PTA which separates it from other identifiable proteins and demonstrate that it is directly converted to activated PTA by incubation with trace quantities of activated Hageman factor or Hageman factor prealbumin fragments.

40|$|B LOOD {{coagulation}} is {{the result}} of a complex series of reactions. Normally, once ini-tiated, the whole process proceeds at an ac-celerating rate until completed.

FIRST STAGE The formation of thromboplastin can be considered the first stage.

With the development of isotope labeling, it has for the first time become possible to carry out such stud-ies. We (1 - 3) and others (1 - 10) have applied this technique to studies of platelet and fibrinogen turnover.

By retarding artificially the thromboplastin gen-eration test (TGT) we have been able to show acceleration of thromboplastin generation in cer-tain patients with intravascular thrombosis (5, 6). Our experience to date indicates that 75 per cent of 52 patients who had arteriosclerosis obliterans with thrombosis demonstrated the acceleration, 50 per cent of 40 patients with "idiopathic " recurrent thrombophlebitis did likewise, but only 11 per cent of 35 patients who had arteriosclerosis obliterans without thrombosis exhibited acceleration of the TGT. Of several hundred "normal " plasmas, less than 1 per cent was abnormally rapid in the TGT.

40|$|In the United States, the {{two-stage}} {{theory of}} blood coagulation is widely accepted. This theory recently reviewed by Quick (1) and Eagle (2) sug-gests {{that in the}} first stage prothrombin, calcium ion and thromboplastin interact to form thrombin. Thrombin, in the second stage, converts fibrinogen to fibrin. <b>Plasma</b> <b>thromboplastin</b> has been con-sidered to be of platelet origin. The phenomenon of the initiation of coagulation when blood is shed has been considered by many investigators to be due to the disintegration of platelets with the re-lease of thromboplastin. It has been known for many years that the co-agulation time of blood taken in paraffin tubes is much longer than that of blood taken in glass tubes. The explanation usually offered for this phenomenon is that the glass, acting as a foreign surface, destroys the platelets at a more rapid rate than occurs in the presence of paraffin. The in-creased amount of thromboplastin so liberated is then considered to be responsible for the shorter coagulation time in glass vessels. Nolf (3) has criticized this explanation. He states that his ex-perimental data indicate that cell- and platelet-free plasma already contains all of the factors necessary for blood coagulation. He believes that the initia-tion of coagulation {{is the result of the}} direct modi-fication of one or more of the constituents of cell-free plasma by contact with a foreign surface such as glass.

40|$|The {{function}} of platelets in the clotting process {{is still a}} matter of controversy. In Morawitz's classic formulation (1) the role of furnishing thromboplastin was attributed to them. Brink-hous, who agrees with this concept, has demon-strated that platelet-free, "quasi-hemophilic" plasma does not clot (2). According to him (2, 3) the thromboplastin contained in platelets is set free during clotting through the action of a plasma factor functioning as a thrombocytolysin. The fundamental defect in hemophilia {{is thought to be}} a diminution or absence of this plasma factor. Other investigators (4, 5), however, have main-tained that the quantities of thromboplastin found in platelets are too small to be of significance in coagulation. According to Quick (3, 6) they liberate an enzyme, thromboplastinogenase, which interacts with the plasma factor, thromboplastino-gen, to form thromboplastin. Hemophilia again is interpreted to be a deficiency of the plasma factor, i. e., a lack of substrate for the platelet enzyme. Ware and associates (7) analyzed platelet extracts and found traces of thromboplastin, an accelerator analogous to serum Ac-globulin and a factor which enhances the action of thrombin on fibrinogen. During the study of two patients with hemo-philia-like disease caused by circulating anticoagu-lants which seemed to inhibit either the formation or utilization of thromboplastin, we found (8) that a concentrated homogenate 3 of ground-up platelets was able to restore the markedly prolonged clot-ting times to normal. Quick and Stefanini (9) have suggested that in hemophilia-like disease the anticoagulant may inhibit the action of the platelet enzyme on the <b>plasma</b> <b>thromboplastin</b> precursor...|$|R
