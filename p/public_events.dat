5|$|After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, a {{representative}} of the Fidel Castro government asked Árbenz to come to Cuba, to which he readily agreed, sensing an opportunity to live with fewer restrictions on himself. He flew to Havana in July 1960, and, caught up {{in the spirit of the}} recent revolution, began to participate in <b>public</b> <b>events.</b> His presence so close to Guatemala once again increased the negative coverage he received in the Guatemalan press. He was offered the leadership of some revolutionary movements in Guatemala but refused, as he was pessimistic about the outcome.|$|E
5|$|As Sicily now {{becomes a}} more {{politically}} stable, secure and less corrupt environment, the Baroque palazzi are slowly beginning {{to open their}} doors to an eager paying public, American and Northern European as much as Italian. In 1963, when the movie The Leopard was released the Gangi Palace ballroom was almost unique in its status of having been a film set, but today long unused salons and ballrooms are hosting corporate and <b>public</b> <b>events.</b> Some palazzi are offering a bed and breakfast service to paying guests, once again providing impressive hospitality to visitors to Sicily, the purpose {{for which they were}} originally intended.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Gaols Committee's inquiries, several key figures within the jails were tried for murder in August 1729, {{including}} Thomas Bambridge of the Fleet and William Acton of the Marshalsea. Given the strongly worded report of the Gaols Committee, the trials were major <b>public</b> <b>events.</b> Ginger writes that, when the Prince of Wales's bookseller presented his bill {{at the end of that}} year, two of the 41volumes on it were accounts of William Acton's trial.|$|E

The dynamics of a susceptible-infected-susceptible and susceptible-infected-removed epidemic models incorporated with information propagation of emergency <b>public</b> <b>event</b> are studied. In particular, we investigate the propagation {{model and the}} infection spreading pattern using nonlinear dynamic method and results obtained through extensive numerical simulations. We further generalize the model for any arbitrary number of infective network nodes to mimic existing scenarios in online social network. The simulation results reveal that the inclusion of multiple infective node achieved stability and equilibrium in the proposed information propagation model...|$|R

5|$|As well as {{the mayoral}} inaugurations, the {{marketplace}} was also the setting for other <b>public</b> <b>events,</b> particularly mourning processions on the deaths of monarchs, coronation celebrations, royal birthdays and celebrations of military victories. Firework displays and bonfires would be held on these occasions, accompanied by the local militia firing volleys and the ringing of the bells of the surrounding churches, while local residents and shopkeepers would illuminate their windows with lit candles. Often, particularly in the 18thcentury, temporary triumphal arches would be erected beside the Guildhall. Free beer would traditionally be distributed at these events, which would on occasion degenerate into drunken disorder.|$|E

The Village Hall is also used as the local Polling Station.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, {{the palace}} {{including}} the entire estate {{was purchased by}} the City of Braunschweig. One condition for the purchase was that no structural changes ever be made and the park not be built on. The palace, which was rebuilt after the Second World War and reconstructed in 1987 to the historic original design, is now used for <b>public</b> <b>events.</b> The nearly four-hectare park has been {{open to the public}} since 1964.|$|E

5|$|The Settlement of Singapore had no {{separate}} flag, {{although the}} city was granted a coat of arms which featured a lion in 1911. During the occupation of Singapore by the Japanese during the Second World War, the Japanese national flag was used on land by the military and during <b>public</b> <b>events.</b> Soon after the Second World War, Singapore became an independent Crown colony and adopted its own flag. It was modified from the Straits Settlements flag {{to reduce the number}} of crowns from three to one.|$|E
5|$|Details of the {{assassination}} attempt were allegedly known by the principal Jesuit of England, Father Henry Garnet. Although {{he was convicted of}} treason and sentenced to death, doubt has been cast on how much he really knew of the plot. As its existence was revealed to him through confession, Garnet was prevented from informing the authorities by the absolute confidentiality of the confessional. Although anti-Catholic legislation was introduced soon after the plot's discovery, many important and loyal Catholics retained high office during King James I's reign. The thwarting of the Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for many years afterwards by special sermons and other <b>public</b> <b>events</b> such as the ringing of church bells, which have evolved into the Bonfire Night of today.|$|E
5|$|Eva Anna Paula Hitler (née Braun; 6 February 1912– 30 April 1945) was the {{longtime}} companion of Adolf Hitler and, for fewer than 40 hours, his wife. Braun met Hitler in Munich {{when she was}} a 17-year-old assistant and model for his personal photographer; she began seeing him often about two years later. She attempted suicide twice during their early relationship. By 1936, she was a part of his household at the Berghof near Berchtesgaden and lived a sheltered life throughout World War II. Braun was a photographer, and many of the surviving colour photographs and films of Hitler were taken by her. She was a key figure within Hitler's inner social circle, but did not attend <b>public</b> <b>events</b> with him until mid-1944, when her sister Gretl married Hermann Fegelein, the SS liaison officer on his staff.|$|E
