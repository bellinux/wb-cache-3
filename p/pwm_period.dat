40|$|A {{pulse width}} {{modulation}} (PWM) bypass capacity control technique for air conditioners has been developed to achieve high scroll compressor efficiency over a wide capacity range, and we investigated the technique’s fundamental characteristics in this study. With this capacity control technique, the refrigerant flow rate is controlled by periodically switching a full load mode, in which the refrigerant is compressed and discharged out of the compressor, and an unload mode, in which the refrigerant is not compressed so that the power needed to compress is unnecessary. In this study, we measured the pressure and input power of a compressor using the control technique to clarify the technique’s dynamic characteristics. We also developed a numerical simulation model to predict the dynamic behavior of the refrigerant. The calculated pressures {{were found to be}} in good agreement with the measured pressures and were used to estimate the relation between the <b>PWM</b> <b>period</b> and the efficiency or the discharge flow rate. Since the <b>PWM</b> <b>period</b> could not be determined by the demanded load capacity, the estimations were used to determine it. Using this period, we carried out performance tests of a compressor with PWM bypass capacity control. The results showed the capacity reached 30 % of the lower limit of rotational speed and that the calculated efficiencies agreed well with the experimental findings...|$|E

40|$|The {{recently}} introduced semi-quasi-Z-source in- verter {{can be interpreted}} as a DC-DC converter whose input- output voltage gain may take any value between minus infinity and 1 depending on the applied duty cycle. In order to generate a sinusoidal voltage waveform at the output of this converter, a time-varying duty cycle needs to be applied. Application of a time-varying duty cycle that produces large-signal behavior requires careful consideration of stability issues. This paper provides stability results for both the large-signal averaged and the switched models of the semi-quasi-Z-source inverter operating in continuous conduction mode. We show that if the load is linear and purely resistive then the boundedness and ultimate boundedness of the state trajectories is guaranteed provided some reasonable operation conditions are ensured. These conditions amount to keeping the duty cycle away from the extreme values 0 or 1 (averaged and switched models), and limiting the maximum <b>PWM</b> switching <b>period</b> (switched model). The results obtained can be used to give theoretical justification to the inverter operation strategy recently proposed by Cao et al. in [1].

40|$|Gyro {{is one of}} {{the major}} parts of the space vehicle. Gyro is used to measure the {{rotational}} rate of the space vehicle. One of the Laser technologies is used in the gyro. The laser beam must be incident on the photo diode without any abstraction. If any magnetic field is present, the laser beam is bending. But it must be avoided. But sometimes due to external influences gyro will effect by the magnetic field. So, we need to demagnetize the gyro. To demagnetizing the gyro, one method is used namely known as degaussing. Degaussing is the process of decreasing or eliminating an unwanted magnetic field. But it is generally not possible to reduce a magnetic field completely to zero, so degaussing typically induces a very small "known " field referred to as bias. The original method of degaussing was to install electromagnetic coils into system, known simply as coiling. The paper is how to degauss the gyro using microcontroller AT 90 S 2313. To degaussing the gyro, applied voltage time must be controlled. This is achieved by pulse width modulation by changing the duty cycle. In <b>PWM,</b> the <b>period</b> remains Constant, but the duty cycle changes. For PWM wave generation, the count for the total period is calculated and the ON time is subtracted from it to get the off time, this is given by T=Ton +Toff. Once pwm wave is generated it must be amplified by the power amplifier because the magnetic coil has a low resistance. Due to this it draws more power; if we connect the coils directly to the microcontroller it cannot supply such amount of power. For this purpose L 6203 full bridge power amplifier is used. Power on reset is a process of reset the micro controller before functioning. Generally every micro controller has a prescribed voltage level. If voltage fallen below the prescribed level it must be shut down. For this purpose ADM 706 supervisory circuit is used...|$|R

TF concentrations in culture supernatant tended to gradually increase from the beginning of MNC culture to a peak at day 3 to 5. In contrast, intracellular concentrations of TF were decreased after MNC culture in parallel with the increase of TF concentration in the supernatants. The presence of mitogens mostly diminished TF concentrations in culture supernatant at the time when DNA synthesis maximally occurred. Transferrin release from MNC cultured at 4 °C was minimal. A higher iron ion {{concentration of}} the culture medium suppressed the TF release from MNC. These results suggested that TF was actually released from MNC when cells were resting but in active metabolism at low iron concentration. In addition, the kinetics of TF release by MNC from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients were different from that of healthy controls. Low spontaneous TF release from SLE MNC through the culture and higher TF release from RA MNC in PHA stimulation after culture for 5 days were observed. These abnormalities found in SLE and RA might be one of causes of the low responsiveness of MNC in these patients to various mitogens...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} the current–flux-linkage ($i{-}psi$) diagram to validate the performance of a general magnetic-energy-based torque estimator. An early step in the torque estimation is the use of controller duty cycles to reconstruct the average phase-voltage waveform during each pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) switching period. Samples over the fundamental period are recorded for the estimation of the average torque. The fundamental period may not be an exact multiple of the sample time. For low speed, the reconstructed voltage requires additional compensation for inverter-device losses. Experimental validation of this reconstructed waveform with the actual PWM phase-voltage waveform is impossible {{due to the fact that}} one is PWM in nature and the other is the average value during the <b>PWM</b> <b>period.</b> A solution to this is to determine the phase flux-linkage using each waveform and then plot the resultant $i{-}psi$ loops.

The concept is to use pulse-width modulation (PWM) instead of level-crossing logic. A finite state machine is used to handle the case where a single unit has multiple stages of operation.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of an interleaved Buck converter is typically low at light load conditions {{because of the}} switching losses {{in each of the}} switching stages. Improvements in the converter efficiency can be achieved by dynamically changing the number of active phases depending on the load current. This paper addresses the issues related to the transient response of the converter when the number of active phases is changed by a digital control scheme. The problem arises because the current in the individual phases of the interleaved Buck converter will not be equal immediately after the controller has changed the number of active phases. This paper proposes a current equalisation scheme that adjusts the duty cycle of each phase in a manner that ensures equal average inductor current in all active phases in one or two PWM periods. The current equalisation scheme relies on the measurement of the output current and the knowledge of a few converter parameters and it does not require a measurement of the current in each phase. A digital PWM modulator has been designed that allows the current equalisation scheme to work. Simulations and measurements for a four phase interleaved Buck converter are presented and shows that the predictive current equalisation scheme can equalise the phase currents in a single <b>PWM</b> <b>period...</b>|$|E
40|$|Interior {{permanent}} magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) are being increasingly used in industry,home application and automobile. The advantages are reduction of motor loss, higher power density,lower rotor inertia, and more robust of the rotor. Since {{the cost and}} space of position sensor aredisadvantages, sensorless IPMSM control systems make these drivers more competitive. The MSVPWM pattern based on the saliency effect for sensorless control has good performance atvery low speed and independent on motor parameters. In this method, the HF components of voltage and　current produced by the MSVPWM pattern are used. In　this way, no injected signal interacts with the　current controller. The response of HF component is obtained by a simple current sampling device. With　this method, the real-time position can be evaluated at low and zero speed. The main study in thesis {{is shown in the}} following. (1) In practical application, the inverter nonlinear effects, e. g., voltage drop in power devices, deadtime, gate drive circuits delay, switching delay, parasitic capacitance effect, zero current clamping effect, and so on, introduce disturbance. Note that the switching state must to be changed more frequently than that in the conventional SVPWM during a modulation period. The voltage vectors during deadtime are uncertain and multiple because all the six output voltage vectors are nonzero. Therefore, the influence of the inverter nonlinear effects is more complicated and serious. An improved position estimationscheme with inverter nonlinear effects ompensation is developed. (2) An inductance estimation method for sensorless IPMSM drives is discussed. It is unique to thismethod that not only the rotor position but also the inductance parameter values can be estimatedinstantaneously during a modulation period. Unfortunately, all the position estimation methods based on the saliency effect can identify the axis of the magnets, but not the magnetic polarity. A novel magnet polarity identification method for initial position estimation during startup for sensorless IPMSM drive is presented. The method is based on MSVPWM pattern. It is unique that magnet polarity can be identified by the variation of the estimated d-axis inductance. (3) Since the conventional SVPWM is possibly the best among all the PWM techniques, modified PWM pattern must compromise PWM performance {{in order to make the}} magnetic saliency effect available. One disadvantage of modified PWM pattern is that the undesired switching sequence boosts theharmonics current. Since six active voltage vectors are generated by the MSVPWM during a <b>PWM</b> <b>period,</b> the output sequences of the six error voltage vectors lead to the different kinds of current ripple. This paper analyzes the current ripple during a <b>PWM</b> <b>period</b> for the various possible schemes of MSVPWM, and proposes a novel PWM scheme for reduced current ripple. The harmonic loss and the efficiency of the system can be improved by the proposed PWM scheme. エネルギーや地球環境の問題を解決していく上で，電気エネルギーを高効率で変換，制御することのできるパワーエレクトロニクス技術の重要性がますます高まっている。内部永久磁石同期モータ(IPMSM) には，体積が小さい，重量が軽い，構造が簡単，効率が高い，制御性が良いなどの特長があるため，現在電気自動車や風力発電などの応用分野で広く採用されている。ネオジム磁石を使った永久磁石同期モータが登場する以前は，自動車を走らせるような大出力の交流モータとして主に誘導モータが使用されてきた。現在では，IPMSMは小型高性能という点で誘導モータを上回り，電気自動車の高性能化に大きく貢献している。IPMSMの速度閉ループ制御にはモータの位置信号が必要であるため，通常はモータに位置センサを取付ける必要があるが，以下のような欠点がある： 1. 位置センサとそのスペースのため，コストと体積が増加。 2. 位置センサの信号線の断線などによる信頼性。 3. 位置センサによる耐環境性（高低温度、湿度、振動）に対する制約。以上の問題を解決するため，モータの電圧、電流と数学モデルを利用して、位置信号を獲得する，すなわち位置センサレスIPMモータ駆動システムが提案されている。この位置センサレスIPMSM駆動システムの高性能化は駆動システムの低コスト、省スペース，高信頼性化のために最も重要なテーマの一つである。IPMSMの突極性によって，固定子巻線から見た自己インダクタンスは回転子の位置によって変化するので，自己インダクタンスを測定し,dq軸インダクタンスの違いを利用して回転子位置を推定可能である。突極性に基づく位置センサレス駆動の利点は停止時や低速時にも位置推定が可能、推定精度が高いである。本論文ではこの位置推定法を採用する。本論文の構成をまとめると以下のようになる。(1) マルチ空間ベクトルPWMパターンで発生する電流の大きさはモータの磁気特性との関係がある。印加される電圧信号と発生する電流の大きさはモータの回転子位置情報を含んでいる。相電流から高調波電流を抽出できるが，インバータの非線形性のため，実際に印加される高調波電圧は理論値に対して，誤差が発生し，位置推定にも悪影響を与える。このため，高調波電圧の誤差を補償して，位置推定の精度を改善する方法を開発した。(2) 突極性に基づく位置推定法では磁極の判定が原理的に不可能である。このため，モータを始動する際，推定インダクタンスの変化に基づく磁極判定法を開発した。この方法はモータの位置信号を推定すると同時に，インダクタンスもリアルタイムで推定できるという他の方法にはない特性を用いて，磁気飽和によりインダクタンスが変化する特性を利用して磁極検出を行った。(3) 提案しているマルチ空間ベクトルPWMを用いた方法は、PWMにより発生する高調波電圧電流成分を利用して，位置推定を行う。発生する高調波電流成分の大きさは電圧指令値及びPWMパターンで決めた出力電圧ベクトルの順番と関係して，有効成分と無効成分を二種類に分けることができる。しかし，これまでにこのPWMパターンに対する高調波電流成分の大きさを理論計算した研究はない。位置推定用に必要な高調波電流成分を維持しつつ，無効な高調波電流成分をできる限り低減して，高調波電流による損失やトルクリプルを改善することを目的とする...|$|E
40|$|To avoid large {{fluctuations}} of the {{dc-link voltage}} of switched reluctance drives, usually large capacitors are used. To achieve this, electrolytic capacitors providing high capacitance densities are typically employed. As these particular devices {{are prone to}} deterioration, they frequently cause failures and thereby reduce the overall life time of the drive. It is therefore subject of current research to diminish the minimum necessary amount of capacitance for a safe operation of the drive, {{in order to make}} the utilization of alternative capacitor technologies possible. In this thesis, two novel approaches are being presented, which allow for a significant reduction of the stress on the dc-link capacitor of a switched reluctance drive. Starting from a comprehensive investigation of different typical load cases, the commutation process of phase currents, which is a characteristic trait of switched reluctance motors, is being identified as the main reason for a low-frequency current strain of the dc-link capacitor. The proposed methods help reduce the load on the dc-link capacitor significantly only by means of control and do therefore not require any modifications of the machine or the drive. Both strategies influence the current waveform of the outgoing phase during the commutation process in such a way that the charge being fed back into the dc-link capacitor is minimized. The first method is based on pulse width modulation and varies the duty cycle of the outgoing phase during commutation to keep the charge in the dc-link capacitor constant during every <b>PWM</b> <b>period.</b> Besides very small residual voltage fluctuations in the dc-link, it can be shown by investigations of the frequency spectrum of the dc-link current that the stress on the dc-link capacitor is completely eliminated at the fundamental electrical frequency. In addition to that, comprehensive computer simulations are carried out to show that the proposed control method does not compromise important performance criteria, such as efficiency or torque ripple. The second introduced control scheme is based on hysteresis control and can be integrated into a conventional current hysteresis control without great efforts. In this approach, the dc-link voltage is observed by a hysteresis controller, which controls the switches of the outgoing phase in such a way that the dc-link voltage stays below a pre-defined limit during commutation. It is shown that this scheme does not degrade the performance of the drive as well. This thesis is concluded by an experimental validation of the proposed control methods on a test stand. Measurements of the dc-link voltage prove that both approaches lead to a significant reduction of the ripple voltage compared to conventional control structures. The remaining ripple voltage of the pulse width modulation scheme is slightly smaller compared to the hysteresis control, which makes it better suited for a combination with controls requiring a constant dc-link voltage...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} it is first {{presented}} how robust control {{can be used}} to give AC motor drive systems competitive dynamic performance under parameter variations. These variations are common to all AC machines, and are a result of temperature change in the machine, and imperfect machine models. This robust control is, however, dependent on sensor operation {{in the sense that the}} rotor position is needed in the control loop. Elimination of this control loop has been for many years, and still is, a main research area of AC machines control systems. An integrated PWM modulator and sampler unit has been developed and tested. The sampler unit is able to give current and voltage measurements with a reduced noise component. It is further used to give the true derivative of currents and voltages in the machine and the power converter, as an average over a <b>PWM</b> <b>period,</b> and as separate values for all states of the power converter. In this way, it can give measurements of the currents as well as the derivative of the currents, at the start and at the end of a single power inverter state. This gave a large degree of freedom in parameter and state identi_cation during uninterrupted operation of the induction machine. The special measurement scheme of the system achieved three main goals: By avoiding the time frame where the transistors commutate and the noise in the measurement of the current is large, filtering of the current measurement is no longer needed. The true derivative of the current in the machine is can be measured with far less noise components. This was extended to give any separate derivative in all three switching states of the power converter. Using the computational resources of the FPGA, more advanced information was supplied to the control system, in order to facilitate sensorless operation, with low computational demands on the DSP.   As shown in the papers, this extra information was first used to estimate some of the states of the machine, in some or all of the speed regions of the machine. The information was then combined to increase the dynamic performance of the sensorless operation of induction machines using the DTC algorithm, even under temperature variations. The scope of this thesis is to develop and test strategies for improving the performance of motor drive systems, when subjected to parameter variations in the machine. First, this is performed by modifying the controller towards a more robust controller, while later a special sampler is developed, in order to estimate machine parameters on-line. This development is shown in the following papers:  In the first paper, a complete motor drive system is built, and an H 1 current controller is implemented, instead of a previously designed PI controller with decoupling. The results show that this controller is able to perform similar to a classical PI-controller, even when subjected to parameter variations, at the cost of increased computational demands. The second paper presents a form of robust decoupling for a PI-controller as an alternative to the higher-order H 1 controller from the first paper. Although there is no speed input to the decoupling network, rotor position feedback from a resolver is still needed for the FOC to work correctly. The special sampler is introduced in the third paper. Here the sampler is used to estimate the rotor ux angle, based on measurements of the derivative of the machine currents in speci_c parts of the PWM-period. The estimator shows good performance. The estimation principle is based on measurements during the zero-period of the inverter, though. This gives poor performance in the upper speed region, when the zero-period 1 of the inverter is small or non-existent. In the fourth paper, the zero-state as well as the two active states of the inverter are used to estimate the rotor speed in a machine. This gives the opportunity of estimating machine parameters in the whole speed region, except around standstill, and the results show good performance, both static and dynamic. A combination of the DTC-algorithm and the sampler is presented in paper 5. Here, the sampler is used with a di_erent scheme to estimate the stator resistance, which a_ects the torque and speed estimation. The tests show that the sampler correctly identi_es the change in stator resistance and in this way makes it possible to achieve constant torque and speed, using the DTC-algorithm, even under stator resistance change. The overall contribution to knowledge in this thesis is that a machine control system can be made less dependent on parameter variations during operations of the machine, without interfering with the operation of the power inverter. This can be done by carefully designing the controller, or in the case of sensorless operation, by means of the specialized sampler developed as a part of the work presented.   1 The zero-period refer to the state where all the lower switches in the switching matrix are in the same state, and all the upper switches are in the same state, but opposite to the lower switches, connecting the outputs of the power converter either to the high or low potential of the DC-bus.
