The results show that PEG-lipid degradation could be markedly inhibited in the <b>post-modification</b> method.

40|$|Peptidoglycan (PG) N-acetyl muramic acid (MurNAc) O-acetylation {{is widely}} spread in gram-positive {{bacteria}} and is generally associated with resistance against lysozyme and endogenous autolysins. We report here {{the presence of}} O-acetylation on N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in Lactobacillus plantarum PG. This modification of glycan strands was never described in bacteria. Fine structural characterization of acetylated muropeptides released from L. plantarum PG demonstrated that both MurNAc and GlcNAc are O-acetylated in this species. These two PG <b>post-modifications</b> rely on two dedicated O-acetyltransferase encoding genes, named oatA and oatB, respectively. By analyzing the resistance to cell wall hydrolysis of mutant strains, we showed that GlcNAc O-acetylation inhibits N-acetylglucosaminidase Acm 2, the major L. plantarum autolysin. In this bacterial species, inactivation of oatA, encoding MurNAc O-acetyltransferase, resulted in marked sensitivity to lysozyme. Moreover, MurNAc over-O-acetylation was shown to activate autolysis through the putative N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase LytH enzyme.

CD and fluorescence spectroscopies were suitable for characterizing the enzyme-nanoparticle interaction. Immobilization process induced different conformational state with a strong denaturation of the enzyme. A strong decreasing and shift in the ellipticity and emission maximum were observed.

The main {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the impact of PEG-lipid molar weight against the differences in the pharmacokinetics, the drug-release profile, and the antitumor effect between the proposed PEG-modification method, called the <b>post-modification</b> method, and the conventional PEG-modification method, called the pre-modification method. Various comparative studies were performed using irinotecan as a general model drug. The results showed that PEG-lipid degradation could be markedly inhibited in the <b>post-modification</b> method. Furthermore, prolonged circulation time was observed in the <b>post-modification</b> method. The sustained drug-release was observed in the <b>post-modification</b> method by the results of the drug-releasing test in plasma. Moreover, a higher antitumor effect was observed in the <b>post-modification</b> method. It was also confirmed that the same behaviors were observed in all comparative studies even though the PEG molecular weight was lower. In conclusion, the <b>post-modification</b> method has the potential to be a valuable PEG-modification method that can achieve higher preservation stability of PEG-lipid, prolonged circulation time, and higher antitumor effect with only half the amount of PEG-lipid as compared to the pre-modification method. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that PEG 5000 -lipid would be more desirable than PEG 2000 -lipid since it requires much smaller amount of PEG-lipid to demonstrate the same performances...|$|E

40|$|In {{the process}} of biomineralization, the {{formation}} of the mineral phase and the final structure depend on involved proteins because of their catalytic activities, specific sizes and colloidal behaviors. This natural synthetic pathway inspired this work to use similar approaches which lead to the formation of various synthetic protein-silica hybrid structures. In this research work SiO 2 micro-/ nanocapsules were enzymatically synthesized, using Pickering emulsions as template for capsules. Recombinant silicatein (a natural protein specific for the Biosilicification), Lysozyme (a natural hydrolase with a similar active site as silicatein) and a synthetic polymer PNIPAAm (an analogue of the enzyme) were applied as enzyme / catalyst. The special feature of this method is that the enzymes are not only enzymatically active but also interfacially active: they self-assemble at the interfaces and form oil-in-water emulsion (SiO 2 precursor as an oil-phase and enzyme solution as aqueous phase) {{and at the same time}} catalyze the condensation of the precursor at the interfaces. Hybrid capsules with tunable size, shell-thicknesses and surface morphology were achieved by using different emulsification methods (mechanical or ultrasonic mixing), different ratio of precursor to protein in solution or by changing the buffer type and composition with the addition of various salts or ionic surfactants. Furthermore, a one-step approach to introduce additional reactivity in the form of primary amine-functionalities on the capsule surface was performed, which makes the system more versatile for possible <b>post-modifications.</b> This research offers insights into the biomimetic mineralization processes using native protein functions and bio-inspired systems.

40|$|Iron oxide {{nanoparticles}} {{are highly}} researched {{for their use}} in biomedical applications such as drug delivery, diagnosis, and therapy. The inherent biodegradable and biocompatible nanoparticle properties make them highly advantageous in nanomedicine. The magnetic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles make them promising candidates for magnetic fluid hyperthermia applications. Designing an efficient iron oxide nanoparticle for hyperthermia requires synthetic, surface functionalization, stability, and biological investigations. This research focused on the following three areas: optimizing synthesis conditions for maximum radiofrequency induced magnetic hyperthermia, designing a simple and modifiable surface functionalization method for specific or broad biological stability, and in vitro and in vivo testing of surface functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles in delivering effective hyperthermia or radiotherapy. The benzyl alcohol modified seed growth method of synthesizing iron oxide nanoparticles using iron acetylacetonate as an iron precursor was investigated to identify significant nanoparticle properties that effect radiofrequency induced magnetic hyperthermia. Investigation of this synthesis under atmospheric conditions revealed a combination of thermal decomposition and oxidation-reduction mechanisms that can produce nanoparticles with larger crystallite sizes and decreased size distributions. Nanoparticles were easily surface functionalized with (3 -Glycidyloxypropyl) trimethoxysilane (GLYMO) {{without the need for}} organic-aqueous phase transfer methods. The epoxy ring on GLYMO facilitated <b>post-modifications</b> via a base catalyzed epoxy ring opening to obtain nanoparticles with different terminal groups. Glycine, serine, γ-aminobutryic acid (ABA), (S) -(-) - 4 -amino- 2 -hydroxybutyric acid (SAHBA), ethylenediamine, and tetraethylenepentamine were successful in modifying GLYMO coated-iron oxide nanoparticles to provide colloidal and varying biological stability while also allowing for further conjugation of chemotherapeutics or radiotherapeutics.

The mutations of FAM 20 A in humans lead to Amelogenesis Imperfecta (AI), gingival hyperplasia and enamel renal syndrome (ERS) in humans. Mutations of FAM 20 B in Danio rerio result in decreased cartilage matrix production and skeletal defects. Mutations in FAM 20 C leads to neonatal lethal osteosclerotic bone dysplasia in humans, known as Raine syndrome. One of the mutants is FAM 20 C-D 478 A. FAM 20 C intracellularly {{functions as a}} Golgi casein kinase. It phosphorylates secretory pathway proteins within S-x-E motif (where S is Ser, X is any amino acid, and E is Glu). Extracellular role of FAM 20 C has also been suggested as a growth and differentiation factor, and the exogenous FAM 20 C treatment accelerates MC 3 T 3 -E 1 osteoblast differentiation and mineralization in vitro. The first {{purpose of this study}} was to purify FAM 20 C protein. HEK 293 cells were transfected with FAM 20 C expression vectors, cell clones that overexpress FAM 20 C were isolated and FAM 20 C protein was collected and purified. The Western blot results of purified FAM 20 C showed higher bands, around 100 kDa and 170 kDa, than expected molecular weight, 66 kDa. Post-translational modification was thought to be the possible reason. Therefore, the second purpose was to find binding proteins of FAM 20 C by mass spectrometry protein identification analysis to check if FAM 20 C has other <b>post-modifications,</b> such as glycosylation. FAM 20 C-WT and FAM 20 C-D 478 A proteins were chosen to perform the study since FAM 20 C-D 478 A was investigated in previous studies of Golgi casein kinase, FAM 20 C, and was found to have no kinase activity. In this study, periostin was identified to bind to FAM 20 C and the binding of these 2 proteins was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Since FAM 20 C functions as a secretory kinase, it is suggested that periostin may be a substrate for FAM 20 C kinase.

40|$|The olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae, {{is among}} the most {{important}} agricultural pests, causing severe economic damage in olive cultivation. The control of the fly is based mainly on the use of organophosphate (OP) insecticides. Apart from the damaging effects that insecticides may have in the environment, their intensive and non-prudent use has also resulted in the development and spread of insecticide resistance in natural insect populations. The aim of the present dissertation was, firstly, the study of OP resistance spread of B. oleae populations and, secondly, the comprehension of the molecular genetic basis of resistance. The primary genetic locus that is involved in OP resistance is the acetylcholinesterase (Ace) gene. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the organization of the Ace locus of B. oleae is studied. A series of genomic library screening and PCR reactions determined the intron-exon organization of the B. oleae Ace locus, which was proved to be very similar to that of Drosophila melanogaster. The B. oleae acetylcholinesterase gene is comprised of ten exons, stretched in an area of over 75 kb of DNA. Furthermore, in silico analysis of the enzyme demonstrated that it maintains the <b>post-modifications</b> of AChE of insects, indicating the high degree of conservation of this genetic locus. OP-resistance in the olive fly was previously shown to be associated with two mutations in the catalytic site of the Ace gene. These mutations conferred a 16 -fold resistance in natural olive fly populations as compared to laboratory reared ones. The frequency of these mutations was monitored in Bactrocera oleae individuals of increasing resistance. Despite the difference in resistance among the individuals, there was no significant frequency variation and no correlation between mutation frequencies and resistance level. Consequently, there must be other contributing factors, such as other mutations, to the variation of resistance. The presence of additional mutations in the Ace gene was investigated in highly resistant insects. Most of mutations that were isolated yielded nothing but silent nucleotide substitutions. However, a short deletion of three glutamines in the carboxylterminal domain of the protein (termed BoaceΔ 642 - 644 or Δ 3 Q) demonstrated particular curiosity. Three diagnostic tests were developed for monitoring the mutation. The analysis of wild olive fly populations showed a significant correlation between mutation frequency, resistance level and OP use. Moreover, biochemical assays on individual flies showed that the remaining activity of Δ 3 Q enzyme was higher than the wild type enzyme. This is the first description of a mutation localized outside the catalytic gorge of AChE with possible involvement in insecticide resistance. It is speculated to affect the GPI-anchoring efficiency or the stability of the protein. In order to investigate the putative role of Δ 3 Q, the wild type and the mutant enzymes were expressed in COS cells, together with a mutant in which all five consecutive glutamines were experimentally deleted (Δ 5 Q). The study and biochemical characterization of the three constructs (wt, Δ 3 Q, Δ 5 Q), as well as their ability to GPI anchor addition, indicated that the Δ 3 Q mutation affects the post-translational modifications of AChE (GPI anchoring, stability/degradation). This suggests an entirely new mechanism of insecticide resistance to OPs, in which a more efficient GPI modification of the enzyme may result in more anchored molecules in the synaptic cleft than the wild-type fly and, therefore, a reduced sensitivity to the insecticide. Finally, the absence of homozygote (Δ 3 Q-/-) individuals in genetic crosses of heterozygotes (Δ 3 Q- /+) advocates for a high fitness cost of the Δ 3 Q mutation. ...|$|R

40|$|Each year, zeolites {{are used}} in {{millions}} of tons and find applications {{in a wide range}} of fields including separation, adsorption, ion exchange, catalysis, and more advanced techniques such as microelectronics, or medical diagnostics. Zeolite frameworks typically consist of silicon and aluminum tetrahedrally coordinated by oxygen atoms, which are shared between two tetrahedra. Owing to their interconnected pore systems in molecular dimensions, they exhibit large surface area and show high stabilities. Nowadays over 200 zeolite framework types have been acknowledged by the International Zeolite Association. Although the existing number of zeolites is huge, synthesis of novel zeolites and studies of the existing ones is necessary to meet the challenges involving more efficient conversion of fossil fuels into cleaner energy sources, abatement of environmental pollution, and development of more greener and cost-efficient chemical processes. The structural diversity of zeolites is further broadened by the option to introduce heteroelements such as Ti, Ge, B and P into the framework. By introducing germanium to reactant mixtures, over 20 novel zeolite topologies have been discovered in the last two decades. Many germanium-based zeolites contain double 4 -ring units where germanium preferably is located. Germanium promotes and stabilizes these small units in zeolite frameworks which would be highly strained in siliceous form. Additionally, zeolite building units composed by small four-membered rings and three-membered rings often lead to porous materials with low framework densities, as these units can serve as stabilizing structures in large rings of the structure. Therefore, a large number of germanosilicate zeolites exhibit interesting large pores in their frameworks due to the presence of double 4 -rings. Aside from facilitating the formation of double four-ring units, Ge-O bonds in zeolite frameworks exhibit high sensitivity to moisture and can undergo hydrolysis even in ambient atmosphere. This instability of Ge-O bonds renders them potential candidates for chemical selective <b>post-modifications.</b> As documented in literature, new zeolites such as COK- 14, IPC- 2 and IPC- 4, or intergrowths IPC- 6 and IPC- 7 have been prepared via post modifications of UTL type germanosilicate zeolites by removal of the hydrolysis sensitive Ge atoms. The objective of this doctoral project was to investigate the templating effect of azonia-spiro organic compounds, more specifically 5 -azonia-spiro[4, 4]nonane, 5 -azonia-spiro[4, 5]decane, 6 -azoniaspiro[5, 5] undecane, 5 -azoniaspiro[4, 6]undecane, 6 -azoniaspiro[5, 6]dodecane, and 7 -azoniaspiro[6, 6] tridecane, on the syntheses of zeolites in the presence of germanium and how the specific structures of germanosilicate zeolites impact on their performances upon post treatment by acid leaching. Pure germanosilicate zeolite with IWW topology has been synthesized by using 5 -azonia-spiro[4, 4]nonane hydroxide as template in fluoride free medium. Literature documented that 1, 5 -bis(methylpyrrolidinium) pentane and hexamethonium can be used for IWW type zeolite synthesis resulting in the discovery of ITQ- 22 material. In this project 5 -azonia-spiro[4, 4]nonane hydroxide was discovered to template IWW zeolite as well. Crystallized IWW was already observed in 1 day and full crystallization was achieved in 3 days. Comparing to ITQ- 22, this IWW-type zeolite has a slightly higher Si/Ge (4. 9 vs. 3. 2). Germanosilicate zeolites generally degrade in very short periods of time in ambient conditions after removal of organic templates. This IWW zeolite was observed to be stable for at least 6 months after calcination. Moreover, the Si/Ge ratio of the obtained IWW zeolite can be further improved from 5 to 10 without noticeable loss of crystallinity by acid treatment. In contrast, 5 -azonia-spiro[4, 5]decane with similar shape and size as 5 -azonia-spiro[4, 4]nonane directs the crystallization towards the formation of a mixture of IWW, NON (nonasil) and a dense sodium germanate phase under similar hydrothermal conditions. Azonia-spiro compounds are known for their low selectivity as templates for zeolites, and it may be assumed these azonia-spiro compounds have been acting mostly as pore filling agents. Observation of a dense sodium germanate phase with 5 -azonia-spiro[4, 5]decane was surprising, as no sodium was added to the synthesis. It turned out the sodium was a contaminant of the template solution, a fact which has been overlooked in literature. Preparation of azonia-spiro compounds typically involves reaction of a cyclic amine and a alkyl halide, followed by purification with a large amount of concentrated sodium hydroxide solutions and sometimes involves even solid sodium hydroxide. Extraction by chloroform should remove most of the inorganic impurities including sodium hydroxide, but this is not always the case. Measurement of the sodium content in a number of azonia-spiro solutions showed that the presence of sodium during zeolite synthesis cannot be neglected. Residual sodium cations have great impacts on zeolite crystallization which may explain some controversial observations in literature. Aluminosilicate zeolites MTW, MOR, etc. have been reported to be generated using azonia-spiro compounds as structure directing agents and sodium as mineralization agent. However, the synthesis of germanosilicates is significantly affected by the residual sodium hydroxide in the template solutions since germanium is consumed as dense sodium germanate in the reactant mixture. Besides, due to the presence of excess sodium hydroxide, the amount of organic azonia-spiro hydroxide for synthesis is systematically overestimated. This issue has been studied for several different azonia-spiro compounds (6 -azoniaspiro[5, 5]undecane, 5 -azoniaspiro[4, 6]undecane, 6 -azoniaspiro[5, 6]- dodecane, and 7 -azoniaspiro[6, 6]tridecane). These compounds were synthesized using a standard procedure and different amounts of residue sodium hydroxide have been observed after purifications. These template solutions led to pure zeolite MTW phases, dense germanates or a mixture of both depending on the amounts of contaminating sodium in the solutions. Pure MTW zeolite were also generated when germanium was absent from synthesis mixture. Sodium germanate formed together with MTW zeolite can possibly be removed by acid leaching, resulted in almost pure MTW and secondary microporosity in MTW. Recently, researchers have reported various <b>post-modifications</b> of germanosilicate zeolites which resulted in new zeolite topologies, created extra mesopores in the micropore zeolite domains or allowed modification of the chemical compositions. Two representatives of post-treatments which alter the parent germanosilicate topology are the inverse sigma transformation and the Assembly-Disassembly-Organization-Reassembly procedure, leading to the discovery of OKO, PCR and also several intergrowth phases. Both approaches involve disassembly of the UTL structure into a layered phase, followed by layer condensation. Sometimes organics were utilized to align the layers to a desired stacking sequence. The instances for generating extra mesopores and modifying chemical compositions included IWW, ITH, IWR and ITR zeolites. Removal of germanium species in IWW zeolite created mesopores and modified germanosilicate IWW into an almost siliceous zeolite with preservation of the IWW topology. Similarly, disassembly of ITH, IWR and ITR into their layered analogues was attempted but only led to significant removal of germanium species from the frameworks. Up to now, UTL zeolite is the unique germanosilicate zeolite to undergo transformation into novel topologies. This raised the question why UTL behaves so different compared to other germanosilicates since they all possess dense silicate layers connected by germanium-enriched D 4 R units. Detailed localization of the Ge species in germanosilicate zeolites is necessary to evaluate the potential of a framework for its use to generate new topologies by sacrifice of specific building units. Investigation of the global germanium distribution in UTL zeolite has been performed by combination of Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction patterns, 19 F-NMR, Ge K-edge EXAFS and theoretic modelling. These characterizations indicated that germanium atoms in UTL zeolites, more specifically in D 4 R units, are observed as S 4 R oriented parallel to the silicate layers they are connecting. This unit can be eliminated by hydrolysis with preservation of the silicate layers which can be condensed into new crystalline zeolite frameworks. The ease with which germanosilicates with UTL topology undergo this arrangement can be based on the unique arrangement of the germanate-oligomer. This detailed Ge location readily explains why UTL zeolite is so susceptible to structural breakdown and reassembling into denser OKO and PCR type zeolite phases by elimination of 4 -rings. nrpages: 107 status: publishe...|$|R
