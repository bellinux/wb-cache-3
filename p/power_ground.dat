In addition to disparaging the B-36, Navy representatives questioned the current U.S. military plan for immediate use of atomic weapons against large urban areas when a war started. The Navy argued that such an approach would not harm military targets, and that tactical air <b>power,</b> <b>ground</b> troops, and sea power were the elements necessary to defend the United States and Europe against attack. The Air Force countered that atomic weapons and long-range strategic bombers would deter war, but that if war nevertheless broke out, an immediate atomic offensive against the enemy would {{contribute to the success}} of surface actions and reduce U.S. casualties. Strategic bombing, the Air Force contended, provided the major counterbalance to the Soviet Union's vastly superior ground forces.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- By the full-wave {{electromagnetic}} field simulation, {{the effectiveness of}} certain measures to reduce the <b>power</b> and <b>ground</b> noise coupling in mixed signal modules is investigated. Segmentation of <b>power</b> and <b>ground</b> planes and proper placement of decoupling capacitors for the reduction of noise coupling are evaluated. With the boom of portable communications industry, challenges in designs of mixed signal modules are becoming increasingly serious. Severe electromagnetic interference may occur in highdensity mixed signal electronic modules. Switching currents of output drivers of high-speed digital circuits can generate significant noise in <b>power</b> and <b>ground</b> supply systems. <b>Power</b> and <b>ground</b> supply noise, together with the noise coupled to the analog and digital signal distribution systems, may cause malfunctioning of both digital and analog circuits. This presentation provides investigations {{on the effectiveness of}} some techniques used for the reduction of <b>power</b> and <b>ground</b> noise coupling. As shown in Figure 1, segmentation of <b>power</b> and/or <b>ground</b> planes are often used for the isolation of different parts of circuits [1]. As signal traces pass through split <b>power</b> or <b>ground</b> planes, severe signal integrity issues will appear [2].
