40|$|Ever {{since the}} elucidation of the {{structure}} of cocaine by Willstater et al (1) in 1898, {{attempts have been made to}} synthesize better local anesthetics without the undesirable physiological properties of the natural product. One of the first of the synthetic local anesthetics, which was not closely related to cocaine in structure, was prepared by Einhorn and Uhlfelder (2) in 1909. This compound was the diethylamino-ethyl ester of p-aminobenzoic acid and was called "novocaine " or more recently "procaine. " Since the synthesis of "procaine, " there have been literally thousands of compounds prepared and tested for local anesthetic activity; but, as yet, no one has managed to prepare a more versatile anesthetic. The results which have been obtained in this search are conflicting and vary over wide limits, and no general correlation of structure with physio-logical activity has been made in this field. This lack of correlation is most striking when one considers the lack of specificity in the acids which have been esterified with amino alcohols.

METHODS: A sample of 451 pregnant women was randomly selected from a general population cohort. At inclusion, the women in this sample completed a self-administered questionnaire about their social and medical characteristics, occupation and exposure to different products at work and in non-occupational activities. Occupational exposure to solvents was assessed from the woman's self-report and from a job-exposure matrix. Eight alkoxycarboxylic acids and trichloroacetic acid and trichloroethanol were measured with chromatography in urine samples collected at inclusion. Associations between metabolite levels and job titles, exposure to products used at work, and solvent exposure were studied. RESULTS: The different glycol ether metabolites were detected in 5. 3 %- 96. 4 % of the urine samples, trichloroacetic acid in 6. 4 % and trichloroethanol in 5. 5 %. Nurses had butoxyacetic acid and <b>phenoxyacetic</b> <b>acid</b> in their urine most often, whereas methoxyethoxyacetic acid was the most frequent among nursing aides.

Volcanic soil with an organic matter content of 8. 7 % was used as adsorbent. Results of studies to determine the equilibrium sorption behaviour for each chemical showed the adsorption data for both <b>phenoxyacetic</b> <b>acids</b> and chlorophenols could be described by a Freundlich-type isotherm equation, the adsorption capacity followed the order: 2, 4, 5 -T > MCPA > 2, 4 -D > 2, 4, 5 -TCP > PCOC > 2, 4 -DCP at all pH and temperature values. Sorption capacity decreased with increasing pH and temperature; the heat of adsorption values indicating chemicals were adsorbed either by physical or hydrogen bonding to the soil surface. Results show only 2 - 4 % of the total surface was occupied indicating chemical adsorption to specific sites present in the soil organic matter. The desorption results indicate isotherm parameters were dependent {{on the amount of}} each chemical adsorbed onto the soil. A linear relationship was developed to obtain the desorption parameters from the adsorption isotherm parameters. Desorption experimental results reveal that all the solutes adsorbed could not be desorbed, indicating a fraction of the chemical was resistant to desorption. A modified Freundlich-type equation described the competitive equilibrium adsorption and desorption of 2, 4 -D-MCPA, 2, 4 -D-PCOC and MCPA-PCOC mixtures. The model incorporated competition coefficients and was found to fit measured data, satisfactorily. The competition coefficients were linearly related to the initial concentration of the solutes in case of adsorption, and on the amount of chemical adsorbed for desorption. The results showed that the adsorption capacity of each solute decreased by about 8 - 12 % in presence of the other competing solutes. However, in case of MCPA, the capacity decreased by 31 % in the presence of 2, 4 -D. The desorption results reveal that 2, 4 -D and MCPA desorbed to a lesser extent in the bicomponent system compared to the corresponding single solute system. Similarly, the desorption of PCOC was less in the presence of 2, 4 -D than of MCPA compared to single solute system. A spinning basket reactor determined the kinetics of sorption for <b>phenoxyacetic</b> <b>acids</b> and chlorophenols. The film-mass transfer coefficients determined from the initial uptake rate data for the first 45 seconds, while the surface diffusion coefficients were obtained by fitting the experimental results with a homogeneous surface diffusion model solution. The desorption diffusion coefficients were found to be of the same order of magnitude as those of adsorption diffusion coefficients. The bicomponent surface diffusion coefficients were found to be slightly smaller (less than 10 %) than single solute surface diffusion coefficients and this was due to competition between the solutes. A surface diffusion model based on equilibrium sorption, film-mass transfer and surface diffusion coefficient along with dispersion was used to predict the soil column data. All the parameters in the model were determined from independent experiments or calculated from literature correlations. The results from the column studies indicate that an increase in the concentration and flow rate resulted in the solutes moving faster in the column. A significant tailing of the chemical was observed at low concentrations for all the solutes. The results indicate that sorption played a dominant role in the transport of chemicals in columns. The breakthrough and elution for <b>phenoxyacetic</b> <b>acids</b> was in the order 2, 4 -D > MCPA > 2, 4, 5 -T. For chlorophenols the order was: 2, 4 -DCP > PCOC > 2, 4, 5 -TCP. The HSDM also used to predict the adsorption and desorption of bicomponent mixtures and the results indicated that the breakthrough and elution occurred earlier than in single solute systems. The order of breakthrough and elution was PCOC > 2, 4 -D > MCPA. To conclude, this thesis presents a detailed investigation of the adsorption and desorption characteristics of <b>phenoxyacetic</b> <b>acids</b> and chlorophenols for single and dual component systems in a volcanic soil.

The Army began experimenting with compounds to destroy crops in April 1944, and within one year had narrowed over 1,000 agents to nine promising ones containing <b>phenoxyacetic</b> <b>acids.</b> One compound designated LN-8 performed best in tests and went into mass production. Dropping or spraying the herbicide was deemed the most effective employment method; a July 1945 test from an SPD Mark 2 bomb, originally crafted to hold biological weapons like anthrax or ricin, had the shell burst open at a predetermined height to send the chemical agent flying. By the time the war ended, the Army was still trying to determine the optimal dispersal height to cover a wide enough area. Active ingredients in LN-8 and another tested compound would later be used to create Agent Orange, used during the Vietnam War. Proposed gas attacks as well as the use of atomic weapons were contemplated to avoid having “an Okinawa from one end of Japan to the other.” ...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies on}} the {{aetiology}} of multiple myeloma are reviewed as a background to this population based case-control study performed in an area with {{a high incidence of}} multiple myeloma. The purpose was to identify and evaluate several suspected environmental factors in relation to this disease. A total of 275 confirmed cases diagnosed in four counties in northern Sweden during four years were compared with the same number of control subjects drawn from population registries. The controls were matched for age, sex, county, and vital status. Occupations and work associated exposures to chemicals and other potential carcinogens were assessed by an extensive questionnaire that also included questions on smoking habits, residential building materials, vicinity to electrical power lines, and leisure time contact with animals, electrical equipment, and chemicals. Information obtained from the questionnaires was completed by telephone interviews when necessary. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were performed. The study confirmed an association found earlier between farming and multiple myeloma. Some domestic animals (cattle, horses, and goats) and two types of pesticides (<b>phenoxyacetic</b> <b>acids</b> and DDT) were indicated as risk factors within farming. Exposure to electromagnetic fields, asbestos, and organic solvents were negatively associated with myeloma in this study...|$|R
