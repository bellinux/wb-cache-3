At the test frequency each element or S-parameter {{is represented by}} a unitless complex number that represents magnitude and angle, i.e. amplitude and phase. The complex number may either be expressed in rectangular form or, more commonly, in polar form. The S-parameter magnitude may be expressed in linear form or logarithmic form. [...] When expressed in logarithmic form, magnitude has the [...] "dimensionless unit" [...] of decibels. The S-parameter angle is most frequently expressed in degrees but occasionally in radians. Any S-parameter may be displayed graphically on a <b>polar</b> <b>diagram</b> by a dot for one frequency or a locus {{for a range of}} frequencies. If it applies to one port only (being of the form [...] ), it may be displayed on an impedance or admittance Smith Chart normalised to the system impedance.

The Smith chart is actually constructed on such a <b>polar</b> <b>diagram.</b> The Smith chart scaling is designed in such a way that reflection coefficient can be converted to normalised impedance or vice versa. Using the Smith chart, the normalised impedance may be obtained with appreciable accuracy by plotting the point representing the reflection coefficient treating the Smith chart as a <b>polar</b> <b>diagram</b> and then reading its value directly using the characteristic Smith chart scaling.

40|$|Shear {{behavior}} {{is one of}} the most important characteristics that contribute to the performance and appearance of woven fabrics. In this paper, a model derived from Kilby's work is first used to predict fabric shear rigidity in different directions. Based on the existing literature, a strong linear relationship is found between shear rigidity (G) and shear hysteresis at two angles (2 HG and 2 HG 5). The model for predicting fabric shear rigidity is then applied to the shear hysteresis of a wide range of woven fabrics by comparing the theoretical data and experimental results and presenting them in the form of <b>polar</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The results show strong linear relationships between shear rigidity and shear hysteresis, not only in the principal directions but also in various bias directions.

The radius of each sector would be proportional to the square root of the death count for the month, so the area of a sector represents the number of deaths in a month.If the death count in each month is subdivided by cause of death, it is possible to make multiple comparisons on one diagram, as is seen in the <b>polar</b> area <b>diagram</b> famously developed by Florence Nightingale.|$|R
