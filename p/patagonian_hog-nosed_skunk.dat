50|$|The eastern hog-nosed skunk {{is found}} only in Southern Texas, Veracruz, Mexico, and ArizonaThe Molina hog-nosed skunk, also known as Andes skunk, (C. chinga) is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Uruguay. Humboldt's hog-nosed skunk, also known as <b>Patagonian</b> <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk</b> (C. humboldtii) finds its habitat in the open grassy areas in the Patagonian regions of Chile and Argentina. The western hog-nosed skunk (C. mesoleucus) is found in, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Sierra Guadalupe, Coahuila, Colima, Honduras, Sonora, and Nicaragua. The striped hog-nosed skunk, C. semistriatus is found in Veracruz, Costa Rica, and Guatemala.|$|E

50|$|Before the merge of the American <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunks,</b> {{the eastern}} <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk,</b> Conepatus leuconotus is {{typically}} {{larger than the}} western <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk,</b> Conepatus mesoleucus. Female eastern <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunks</b> range from 58-74 cm in length and 19-34 cm in height. They weigh between 2.0-4.0 kg. Male <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunks</b> range from 56-92 cm in length and 22-41 cm in height. They weigh on average between 3.0-4.5 kg. The western <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk</b> ranged from 40-84 cm in length, 13-35 cm in height, and 1.1-2.7 kg. Males are larger than females and can occasionally reach 4.5 kg.

50|$|The <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunks</b> {{belong to}} the genus Conepatus and {{are members of the}} family Mephitidae (skunks). They are native to the Americas. They have white backs and tails and black underparts.|$|R
50|$|Its flora is countless and beautiful, {{including}} important {{groups of}} Puya Raimondi. In its fauna, there are tarucas, spectacled bears, vicuñas, pumas, foxes, vizcachas, weasels, Andean mountain cats, opossums, <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunks,</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|The American <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk</b> has stocky {{legs and}} {{plantigrade}} feet (the entire sole {{of the foot}} touches the ground). Its hind feet are broad and large with soles that are naked for about one-half their length. Its upper body is powerfully built, and the fore claws are very long. Length can range from 44.4 - 93.4 cm and weight is typically 1,130 - 4,500 g. The striped skunk can broadly overlap in size with this species, but in comparison the striped, has a shorter head-and-body length and a longer tail than the <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk.</b> Males of this species average about 10% larger than females.|$|R
50|$|Among the mammals {{reported}} {{from the same}} area are: the colocolo, the Andean mountain cat, the spectacled bear, the taruca deer, the vicuña, the white-tailed deer, the puma, the northern viscacha, the long-tailed weasel, the <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk</b> and the Andean fox.|$|R
50|$|Molina’s <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk,</b> Conepatus chinga, {{is similar}} to the common skunk with scent glands used to spray an odorous liquid to offend {{potential}} predators. They have a resistance to pit viper venom, distinct thin white markings and a pink, hog-like, fleshy nose.|$|R
50|$|Skunk species vary in {{size from}} about 15.6 to 37 in long and in weight from about 1.1 lb (spotted skunks) to 18 lbs kg (<b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunks).</b> They have {{moderately}} elongated bodies with relatively short, well-muscled legs and long front claws for digging.|$|R
50|$|The striped <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk,</b> Conepatus semistriatus, is a skunk {{species from}} Central and South America (from {{southern}} Mexico to northern Peru, {{and in the}} extreme east of Brazil). It lives {{in a wide range}} of habitats including dry forest scrub and occasionally, in rainforest.|$|R
50|$|Although {{both the}} spotted skunk and common skunks live mainly on insects, the <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunks</b> {{are even more}} insectivorous in their feeding habits. The bare snout appears to be used {{constantly}} {{for the purpose of}} rooting out beetles, grubs, and larvae of various kinds from the ground.|$|R
5|$|More {{than ten}} species of mammals have been {{observed}} in the park, several of them endangered, including the colocolo, the Andean mountain cat, the spectacled bear, the taruca deer, the vicuña, the white-tailed deer, the puma, the northern viscacha, the long-tailed weasel, the <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk</b> and the Andean fox.|$|R
50|$|Foraging mainly at night, the skunk is {{omnivorous}} eating birds, small mammals, eggs, insects, leaves, and fruit. The tooth morphology in the molina’s <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk,</b> {{is different}} than most mammals in that their teeth are adapted to their omnivorous diet with grinding being the main function of the carnassial apparatus.|$|R

50|$|The Molina’s <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk’s</b> native {{range is}} {{throughout}} mid to southern South America, Chile, Peru, northern Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and southern Brazil. The mammal is therefore associated with temperate regions and open areas, mainly {{described as the}} Pampas biome and preferring to live in open vegetation, shrub forest and rocky sloped areas.|$|R
50|$|The {{reserve is}} home to a {{significant}} variety of wildlife including rare and threatened animals such as the Tricahue parrot, Molina's <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk</b> and plants such as the ciprés de la cordillera and roble Maulino.

50|$|Herbivores of the pampas are the pampas deer, guanaco, gray brocket, dwarf mara, plains viscacha, Brazilian guinea pig, {{southern}} mountain cavy and coypu.
