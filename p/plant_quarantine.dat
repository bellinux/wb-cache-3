40|$|The {{production}} of juice and wine grapes in Washington State {{plays a major}} role in its agricultural and related economies. From the farm gate value of fruit to revenue generated by tourism, it is a vital industry in the state. Because of this, Washington has <b>plant</b> <b>quarantines</b> designed to protect commercial grape production in the state from the detrimental introduction of pests and diseases. These rules, however, do not just impact commercial grape growers in the state. If a wholesale or retail plant outlet fails to comply with the quarantines, their reputation, nursery license, and, ultimately, profitability are at stake. This publication provides information necessary for buyers and resellers of wholesale plant material to successfully navigate and adhere to Washington’s grape quarantines in order to avoid monetary loss due to importation of material that does not meet quarantine restrictions or the inadvertent introduction of a pest or disease that could gravely damage the commercial grape industry within the state...|$|R
