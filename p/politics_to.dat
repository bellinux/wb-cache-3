Writers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were very interested in the Watergate scandal and based a lot of the second act on that. Mark Kirkland directed the episode.|$|E
5|$|Baird {{supported}} a Canadian Alliance {{candidate in the}} 2000 federal election, and later endorsed Stephen Harper's bid to lead the newly formed Conservative Party of Canada in its 2004 leadership election. He was appointed as the Conservative Party's Ontario co-chair for the 2004 federal election. There were rumours that Baird would leave provincial <b>politics</b> <b>to</b> contest the 2004 election, but this did not happen. In 2005 he resigned his provincial seat to campaign federally for the Conservative Party.|$|E
5|$|He {{finished}} as {{the first}} runner-up in the Joliet City Council election of 1989, but when a sitting councilwoman died {{a few months after}} the election he was passed over several times for the nomination.

He returned to elective <b>politics</b> <b>to</b> defeat the mayor, who did not nominate him in the subsequent election in 1991.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his early}} {{resolution}} {{not to allow}} <b>politics</b> <b>to</b> impede upon his legal career, Maxwell's resolute support of the Union during the American Civil War, and of the statehood movement for West Virginia, refocused his priorities. Maxwell's political affiliation had been Republican, and he became {{actively involved in the}} formation of the state of West Virginia in 1863. Just weeks prior to the state's creation on June 20 of that year, he began his political career when he was elected to represent the Third Senatorial District in the inaugural session of the West Virginia Senate in June 1863. During his tenure in the senate, which lasted until 1866, Maxwell served as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. In his position as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he played a prominent role in the passage of the state's earliest legislation.|$|E
5|$|General {{elections}} were held on 10 October 2002 under Musharraf to elect the National Assembly. Abbasi {{ran for a}} seat from Constituency NA-50 (Rawalpindi) as a candidate of the PML (N), but lost to PPP candidate Ghulam Murtaza Satti with 63,797 votes (37.21%) to 74,259 (43.31%). Abbasi indicated that the exile of Sharif disappointed the people, due to which PML (N) only won 19 out of 342 seats in the National Assembly. People from his constituency claim he contested the election unwillingly, explaining why he lost it. After his defeat, he distanced himself from <b>politics</b> <b>to</b> focus on Airblue Limited, which he founded in 2003. He served as its first chairman until 2007 {{and then went on}} to become its chief operating officer. According to BBC Urdu, he had close contacts with Shujaat Hussain, leader of the then ruling party, and from whom Abbasi gained support for his airline.|$|E

Brown was re-elected for a full term in November 2004, and again in November 2006, running without opposition the second time. He won re-election in November 2008, defeating Democratic candidate Sara Orozco by a 59–41 percent margin. Following his re-election, Brown was one of five Republicans in the 40-seat Massachusetts Senate. In the Massachusetts Senate, Brown served on committees dealing with consumer protection, professional licensing, education, election laws, public safety, and veterans' affairs.|$|E

5|$|In May 1944, it was {{announced}} that broadcast performers must organize themselves into a union, and that this union would be the only one permitted to operate in Argentina. Shortly after the union formed, Eva Duarte was elected its president. Fraser and Navarro speculate that Juan Perón made the suggestion that performers create a union, and the other performers likely felt it was good <b>politics</b> <b>to</b> elect his mistress. Shortly after her election as president of the union, Eva Duarte began a daily program called Toward a Better Future, which dramatized in soap opera form the accomplishments of Juan Perón. Often, Perón's own speeches were played during the program. When she spoke, Eva Duarte spoke in ordinary language as a regular woman who wanted listeners to believe what she herself believed about Juan Perón.|$|E
5|$|In a {{radio address}} on May 11, Alley {{announced}} {{that due to}} the nullification, the military would heve {{to stay in power}} beyond June 17. He noted that his administration would require extra time to find a successor who was backed by everyone. Alley suggested that the military should retreat back to the barracks at Camp Ghezo and leave Dahomeyan <b>politics</b> <b>to</b> the career politicians. The view was unpopular, and he was outvoted by his military comrades. Alley eventually became little more than Kouandété's mouthpiece.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner {{took office}} as {{president}} of Argentina on 25 May 2003. Contrary to tradition, the ceremony {{was held at the}} Palace of the Argentine National Congress rather than Casa Rosada. He announced that he would spearhead change on many issues, from <b>politics</b> <b>to</b> culture. The ceremony was attended by the provincial governors, Supreme Court president Julio Nazareno, the heads of the armed forces, and Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Raúl Alfonsín was the only former president in attendance. Kirchner walked to the Casa Rosada along Avenida de Mayo, breaking with protocol to get close to the people, and was accidentally hit {{in the head with a}} camera.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Hannegan {{makes an}} {{alliance}} with the kingdom of Laredo and the neighboring, relatively civilized city-states against the threat of attack from the nomadic warriors. Hannegan, however, is manipulating the regional <b>politics</b> <b>to</b> effectively neutralize all of his enemies, leaving him {{in control of the}} entire region. Monsignor Apollo, the papal nuncio to Hannegan's court, sends word to New Rome that Hannegan intends to attack the empire of Denver next, and that he intends to use the abbey as a base of operations from which to conduct the campaign. For his actions, Apollo is executed, and Hannegan initiates a church schism, declaring loyalty to the Pope to be punishable by death. The Church excommunicates Hannegan.|$|E
5|$|Musically, Revolutions per Minute {{is rooted}} in {{hardcore}} punk and melodic hardcore. Critics noted that the album exhibited greater musical maturity and an overall darker tone when compared to its predecessor. It comprises thirteen songs, with lyrical themes ranging from relationships and <b>politics.</b> <b>To</b> promote the album, Rise Against toured extensively with other Fat Wreck Chords bands, and participated in the 2003 Warped Tour. Upon its release, the album reach number thirty-five on the Independent Albums chart, and was praised for its impassioned lyrics and unique blend of hardcore punk and melodic hardcore. Some critics called {{it one of the}} best albums of the year.|$|E
5|$|Part {{of the new}} {{genre of}} the Romantic travel narrative, History of a Six Weeks' Tour exudes spontaneity and enthusiasm; the authors {{demonstrate}} their desire to {{develop a sense of}} taste and distinguish themselves from those around them. The romantic elements of the work would have hinted at the text's radical <b>politics</b> <b>to</b> nineteenth-century readers. However, the text's frank discussion of politics, including positive references to the French Revolution and praise of Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, was unusual for a travel narrative at the time, particularly one authored primarily by a woman.|$|E

5|$|The main {{campaign}} of Empire: Total War involves a player choosing a faction {{and moving to}} forge a global empire during the 18th century. Each faction controls various historical provinces, each with a regional capital, {{and a number of}} other settlements ranging from minor villages to prosperous sea ports (as long as they are coastal territories). The player can recruit armies and navies to take and defend provinces by military means, or adopt diplomacy and <b>politics</b> <b>to</b> make advances in the game. In addition, players can use economics and religion to their advantage, as well as clandestine means such as espionage and assassination. The campaign mode is turn-based, with each turn representing six months starting in summer or winter, allowing the player to attend to all needs of their faction before ending their turn and allowing the artificial intelligence to make all other factions' moves.|$|E
5|$|The poem is an elegy in {{name but}} not in form; it employs a style {{similar to that of}} {{contemporary}} odes, but it embodies a meditation on death, and remembrance after death. The poem argues that the remembrance can be good and bad, and the narrator finds comfort in pondering the lives of the obscure rustics buried in the churchyard. The two versions of the poem, Stanzas and Elegy, approach death differently; the first contains a stoic response to death, but the final version contains an epitaph which serves to repress the narrator's fear of dying. With its discussion of, and focus on, the obscure and the known, the poem has possible political ramifications, but it does not make any definite claims on <b>politics</b> <b>to</b> be more universal in its approach to life and death.|$|E
5|$|The revolt {{started in}} Nablus with the Palestinian general strike in April 1936. The strike spread {{to a number}} of cities {{throughout}} Palestine, including Tulkarm where al-Hajj Muhammad helped organize the campaign. By the summer of that year, several Palestinian Arab rebel bands had sprung up, including the forces of al-Hajj Muhammad. The latter used existing social networks and the complex web of local clan <b>politics</b> <b>to</b> build alliances both with the middle classes of the major towns, particularly the well-educated activists, and the rural clan elders to build a solid base of resistance against the British. In order to avoid detection, al-Hajj Muhammad refrained from commanding a large unit of troops. Instead, he raised small, semi-permanent bands of volunteers called fasa'il (sing. fasl) as he moved from one area to another. They normally launched nighttime attacks against specific targets.|$|E
