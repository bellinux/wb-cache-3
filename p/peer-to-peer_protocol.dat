It was later revealed in a wikileaks document AFACT was backed by MPAA.|$|E

40|$|E-Commerce is a {{distributed}} computing environment with dynamic relationships among {{a large number}} of autonomous service requesters, brokers and providers. With the increasing automation of e-commerce applications, we will see the use of software agents that cooperate to perform business transactions. Multi-agent cooperative transactions are different in their requirements both from conventional atomic transactions executed under centralized control and from nested transactions executed under hierarchical control. Cooperative transactions require <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>protocols</b> based on interagent communication. In this paper, we develop a cooperative mulit-agent transaction model that includes <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>protocols</b> for commit control and failure recovery. The significance and feasibility of this approach have been demonstrated in a prototype implemented at HP Labs, using our dynamic agent infrastructure. 1.

40|$|Peer-to-peer {{networks}} are {{of great value}} for tapping the unused resources of computers residing {{at the edges of}} the internet. However, the recent rise in popularity of peer-to-peer applications has caused the sizes of their underlying networks to grow significantly. Because of their large size and decentralized nature, it is all but impossible to measure the efficiency of the protocols driving these networks in the real world. To facilitate the evaluation of <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>protocols</b> prior to deployment in real networks, this thesis presents a scalable simulation architecture which can be extended to support arbitrary <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>protocols.</b> In particular, the simulator models the competition of messages for bandwidth as traffic increases. For validation purposes, an implementation of multiple versions of the Gnutella protocol is presented. It demonstrates the ability of the simulator to model arbitrary peer behaviour and handle heterogeneous protocols...|$|R

50|$|The {{problem was}} reduced to that of {{designing}} a distributed database that uses slow and unreliable transport for synchronization (later, faster LAN transport was also added).

30|$|More {{technical}} aspects for further development include distribution support, temporary fragmentation or interconnecting several π-Clouds {{in order to}} form a community cloud. As each component of the π-Box can {{be considered to be}} a service, {{it should be possible to}} distribute them throughout the π-Cloud. This implies mechanisms to handle abrupt disconnections of devices which host services, intelligent replication of services, service redundancy and so on. The scientific area of <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>protocols</b> offers a variety of potentially suitable basic technologies for this challenge.|$|R
40|$|Bots {{often are}} {{detected}} by their communication with a {{command and control}} (C&C) infrastructure. To evade detection, botmasters are increasingly obfuscating C&C communications, e. g., by using fastflux or <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>protocols.</b> However, commands tend to elicit similar actions in bots of a same botnet. We propose and evaluate a Bayesian approach for detecting bots based on the similarity of their DNS traffic to that of known bots. Experimental results and sensitivity analysis suggest that the proposed method is effective and robust...|$|R

40|$|Over recent years, we {{experienced}} a huge diffusion of internet connected computing devices. As a consequence, this leaded to research for efficient and scalable approaches {{for managing the}} burden caused by the highly increased volume of data to be exchanged and processed. Efficient communication protocols are fundamental building blocks for realizing such approaches [1], [2]. Thus, several <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>protocols</b> have been proposed. Gossip protocols [3]-[7] are a family of <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>protocols</b> {{that proved to be}} well-suited for supporting a scalable and decentralized strategy for peer and data aggregation and diffusion. However, one of the typical limitation of Gossip protocols consists in the selfish behavior adopted by peers in defining their neighborhood and, as a consequence, the topology of the overlay they build. GROUP [8] is a Gossip protocol we conceived to overcome this limitation. It builds explicit defined communities of peers that are identified by their leaders, each one elected in a distributed fashion. This protocol experimentally proved to be efficient and effective with respect to its aim. Anyhow, no analytical study has been realized so far. This work presents a currently ongoing work we are conducting for exploring the properties of GROUP in a more formal way. We conduct this preliminary investigation using a formalization based on Markov chains...|$|R

5000|$|BuddyCast {{is an open}} <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>protocol</b> for distributing {{streaming}} content to an unlimited number of users by turning broadcast receivers into stream relays, or “buddies.” Developed by Mel Beckman, Denison Bollay, and Brian Fox, the protocol maintains resilience {{through the use of}} standby redundant buddies to replace buddies that leave the network. Broadcast distribution is controlled by a Buddycast Multicast Controller (MC), which hands off inbound requests for streams to available buddies and monitors the state of relayed streams. To this end, the MC maintains a network topology map, which the MC can exploit to improve performance and minimize the number redundant inter-network streams.|$|E
