40|$|Soshi Kanemoto Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan Abstract: <b>Prion</b> <b>diseases</b> are infectious, {{predominantly}} fatal neurodegenerative diseases {{characterized by}} abnormal prion protein (PrP) accumulation and neuronal loss. Studies on experimental animal models and clinical features of human <b>prion</b> <b>diseases</b> have shown unfolded PrP accumulation results in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. While ER stress-mediated apoptosis {{is responsible for}} neuronal loss in <b>prion</b> <b>diseases,</b> ER stress also activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) {{in an effort to}} restore ER homeostasis. Of the UPR signaling pathways, the PERK-eIF 2 α pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis of <b>prion</b> <b>diseases.</b> The proteasome protein degradation system is also activated during the UPR. Increasing evidence indicates that proteasome and autophagy activities are affected in <b>prion</b> <b>diseases.</b> These findings suggest that ER stress/UPR contributes to the onset of <b>prion</b> <b>diseases.</b> Hence, strategies that target the ER are useful approaches in treating <b>prion</b> <b>diseases.</b> Additionally, immunotherapeutic approaches for <b>prion</b> <b>diseases</b> have been developed in recent decades. Single-chain fragment variable antibodies targeting the accumulation of PrP are also beneficial in the prevention of abnormal PrP propagation.

5|$|A 2015 study {{concluded}} that multiple system atrophy (MSA), a rare human neurodegenerative disease, {{is caused by a}} misfolded version of a protein called alpha-synuclein, and is therefore also classifiable as a <b>prion</b> <b>disease.</b> Several yeast proteins have also been identified as having prionogenic properties.|$|E
5|$|Many viruses, {{including}} HIV {{which needs}} CD4 and CXCR4, need a receptor to attach to and enter into host cells.

5|$|Meanwhile, a new <b>prion</b> <b>disease</b> named Psychotic Outburst Syndrome (or POS) is {{affecting}} dogs, causing friendly pets to become violent. Officials struggle {{to control the}} disease and immediately terminate any dogs that catch it. Humans soon begin to contract the disease.|$|E
40|$|Human <b>prion</b> <b>diseases</b> include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), kuru, fatal {{familial}} insomnia (FFI) and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS). The {{conversion of}} the normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) into an insoluble and protease-resistant isoform (PrPSc), which propagates itself by imposing its abnormal conformation onto a PrPC, is fundamental to the pathogenesis of <b>prion</b> <b>diseases.</b> It has been commonly assumed that aggregation of mis-folded PrPSc {{is the cause of}} neurodegeneration in <b>prion</b> <b>diseases</b> [1]. However, in several studies, significant path-ology and clinical dysfunctions can develop even when there is little accumulation of PrPSc. Similarly, the accu-mulation and a high abundance of PrPSc has been accom-panied by limited symptomatology [2].

The unique characteristic common to all of these disorders, whether sporadic, dominantly inherited, or acquired by infection, is that they involve aberrant metabolism of the prion protein. In many cases, the cellular prion protein is converted into the scrapie variant by a process after translation that involves a conformational change.

5|$|A few sheep {{conditions}} are transmissible to humans. Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores {{can be transmitted}} in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the <b>prion</b> <b>disease</b> scrapie and {{the virus that causes}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} model {{assumes that}} PrPSc exists only as fibrils, and that fibril ends bind PrPC and convert it into PrPSc. If this were all, then {{the quantity of}} prions would increase linearly, forming ever longer fibrils. But exponential growth of both PrPSc and of the quantity of infectious particles is observed during <b>prion</b> <b>disease.</b> This {{can be explained by}} taking into account fibril breakage. A mathematical solution for the exponential growth rate resulting from the combination of fibril growth and fibril breakage has been found. The exponential growth rate depends largely on the square root of the PrPC concentration. The incubation period is determined by the exponential growth rate, and in vivo data on prion diseases in transgenic mice match this prediction. The same square root dependence is also seen in vitro in experiments with a variety of different amyloid proteins.|$|E
40|$|<b>Prion</b> <b>diseases</b> are {{transmissible}} neurodegenerative conditions affecting {{human and}} {{a wide range of}} animal species. The pathogenesis of <b>prion</b> <b>diseases</b> is associated with the accumulation of aggregates of misfolded conformers of host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrPC). Animal <b>prion</b> <b>diseases</b> include scrapie of sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease, transmissible mink encephalopathy, feline spongiform encephalopathy, exotic ungulate spongiform encephalopathy, chronic wasting disease of cervids and spongiform encephalopathy of primates. Although some cases of sporadic atypical scrapie and BSE have also been reported, animal <b>prion</b> <b>diseases</b> have basically occurred via the acquisition of infection from contaminated feed or via the exposure to contaminated environment. Scrapie and chronic wasting disease are naturally sustaining epidemics. The transmission of BSE to human has caused more than 200 cases of variant Cruetzfeldt-Jacob disease and has raised serious public health concerns.

40|$|Cell {{biological}} {{studies of}} PrP have contributed enormously {{to our understanding}} of <b>prion</b> <b>diseases.</b> Like other membrane proteins, PrPC is post-translationally processed in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi {{on its way to the}} cell surface after synthesis. Cell surface PrPC constitutively cycles between the plasma membrane and early endosomes via a clathrin-dependent mechanism, a pathway consistent with a suggested role for PrPC in cellular trafficking of copper ions. PrP molecules carrying mutations linked to inherited <b>prion</b> <b>diseases</b> display several abnormalities in their biochemical properties, maturation, and localisation that may explain their patho-genicity. Recent results have clarified the role of the proteasome in degradation of PrP, and the properties of a transmembrane form of PrP which may play a neuro-toxic role in <b>prion</b> <b>diseases.</b> <b>Prion</b> <b>diseases</b> are rare neurodegenerative disorders that result from the conformational conversion of a normal cell-surface protein (PrPC) into a protease-resistant, β-sheet-rich form (PrPSc) that is infectious in the absence of nucleic acid.

40|$|<b>Prion</b> <b>diseases</b> {{which are}} serious {{neurodegenerative}} diseases that affect {{humans and animals}} occur in various of species. Unlike many other neurodegenerative diseases affected by amyloid, <b>prion</b> <b>diseases</b> can be highly infectious. <b>Prion</b> <b>diseases</b> occur in many species. In humans, <b>prion</b> <b>diseases</b> include the fatal human neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI), Gerstmann-Strussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) and Kuru etc. In animals, <b>prion</b> <b>diseases</b> {{are related to the}} bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or &# 8216;mad-cow&# 8217; disease) in cattle, the chronic wasting disease (CWD) found in deer and elk, and scrapie seen in sheep and goats, etc. More seriously, the fact that transmission of the <b>prion</b> <b>diseases</b> across the species barrier to other species such as humans has caused a major public health concern worldwide. For example, the BSE in Europe, the CWD in North America, and variant CJDs (vCJDs) in young people of UK. Fortunately, it is discovered that the hydrophobic region of prion proteins (PrP) controls the formation of diseased prions (PrPSc), which provide some clues in control of such diseases. This article provides a detailed survey of recent studies with respect to the PrP hydrophobic region of human PrP(110 &# 8211; 136) using molecular dynamics studies...|$|R
5|$|The {{protein that}} prions {{are made of}} (PrP) is found {{throughout}} the body, even in healthy people and animals. However, PrP found in infectious material has a different structure and is resistant to proteases, the enzymes in the body that can normally break down proteins. The normal form of the protein is called PrPC, while the infectious form is called PrPSc— the C refers to 'cellular' PrP, while the Sc refers to 'scrapie', the prototypic <b>prion</b> <b>disease,</b> occurring in sheep. While PrPC is structurally well-defined, PrPSc is certainly polydisperse and defined at a relatively poor level. PrP can be induced to fold into other more-or-less well-defined isoforms in vitro, {{and their relationship to}} the form(s) that are pathogenic in vivo is not yet clear.|$|E
5|$|The {{infectious}} isoform of PrP, {{known as}} PrPSc, {{is able to}} convert normal PrPC proteins into the infectious isoform by changing their conformation, or shape; this, in turn, alters the way the proteins interconnect. PrPSc always causes <b>prion</b> <b>disease.</b> Although the exact 3D structure of PrPSc is not known, it has {{a higher proportion of}} β-sheet structure in place of the normal α-helix structure. Aggregations of these abnormal isoforms form highly structured amyloid fibers, which accumulate to form plaques. It is unclear as to whether these aggregates are the cause of cell damage or are simply a side-effect of the underlying disease process. The end of each fiber acts as a template onto which free protein molecules may attach, allowing the fiber to grow. Under most circumstances, only PrP molecules with an identical amino acid sequence to the infectious PrPSc are incorporated into the growing fiber. However, rare cross-species transmission is also possible.|$|E

Presumably the people became infected through prion contaminated beef from cattle with subclinical atypical BSE, which has a very long incubation period. CJD usually affects people aged 45–75, most commonly appearing in people between the ages of 60–65.
