3000|$|SAR in {{indica rice}} {{cultivar}} IR 36 {{was significantly higher}} than in japonica cultivar T 65. Although enzymes for both amylose and amylopectin syntheses had higher activity in IR 36, amylopectin synthesis was seemingly more important for accelerating SAR because an elevation of amylose synthesis ability alone in the T 65 genetic background did not result in the same level of SAR as IR 36. In IR 36, most starch-synthetic genes (SSGs) in the endosperm were more highly expressed during ripening than in T 65. In <b>panicle</b> <b>culture</b> experiments, the SSGs in rice endosperm were regulated in either sucrose-dependent or -independent manners, or both. All SSGs except SSI and BEIIa were responsive to sucrose in both cultivars, and GBSSI, AGPS 2 b and PUL were more responsive to sucrose in IR 36. Interestingly, the GBSSI gene (Wx [...]...|$|E
30|$|Although some SSGs were {{regulated}} by multiple systems, which regulatory systems were most crucial for achieving the higher expression of those SSGs in IR 36 was unclear. In <b>panicle</b> <b>culture</b> without sucrose, AGPL 2, SSIIIa, BEI, BEIIb and ISA 1 genes of IR 36 were more upregulated than in T 65 (Fig.  4 b). This sucrose-independent regulation appeared {{to define the}} basal level of the SSG expression; these SSG levels increased further in a sucrose-dependent manner (Fig.  4 a). Although the sucrose-response patterns of most SSGs for amylopectin synthesis were similar between IR 36 and T 65 (Fig.  4), this sucrose-dependent regulation could also indirectly contribute to the high SSG expression in IR 36. Actually, the sucrose concentration in crude extracts from developing seeds of IR 36 was higher than in those of T 65 {{in the early to}} middle phase of ripening (Fig.  6), so expression of the sucrose-responsive SSGs was expected to be higher in IR 36 than in T 65 during that period.|$|E
40|$|Attempts {{were made}} to explore the {{possibility}} of haploid plant production in oats (Avena sativa L.) through in vitro techniques. For anther culture, among 89 entries, only four cultivars, namely, Cayuse, Manod, Stout and Tarpan, produced calluses. Serial sections of the callusing anthers revealed the pollen origin of these calluses. Genotypic differences in anther response in oats were confirmed. Aborted multicellular structures were observed in the pollen sacs of 12 cultivars/strains. Further improvement of the medium is necessary to ensure the continual development of initiated pollen grains to plantlet formation. Cultivar differences {{in the frequency of}} non-stained (NS) grains were observed. Cold pre-treatment did not increase the frequency of NS or abnormal bi-nucleate grains. The possible effect of cold pre-treatment is to delay anther deterioration, which ensures the survival of more grains to switch into embryogenesis. For ovary and <b>panicle</b> <b>culture,</b> no callus formation was obtained. The potential of the latter approach is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Grain filling rates (GFRs) of {{indica rice}} cultivars are often {{higher than those}} of japonica cultivars. Although GFR is mainly {{determined}} by the starch accumulation rate (SAR) in endosperm, the genetic basis for SAR during the ripening period has not been well studied in rice. To elucidate the factors influencing the differing SARs between typical indica and japonica cultivars, we focused on differences in sink potentials, especially on starch synthesis in the endosperm. SAR in indica rice cultivar IR 36 was significantly higher than in japonica cultivar T 65. Although enzymes for both amylose and amylopectin syntheses had higher activity in IR 36, amylopectin synthesis was seemingly more important for accelerating SAR because an elevation of amylose synthesis ability alone in the T 65 genetic background did not result in the same level of SAR as IR 36. In IR 36, most starch-synthetic genes (SSGs) in the endosperm were more highly expressed during ripening than in T 65. In <b>panicle</b> <b>culture</b> experiments, the SSGs in rice endosperm were regulated in either sucrose-dependent or -independent manners, or both. All SSGs except SSI and BEIIa were responsive to sucrose in both cultivars, and GBSSI, AGPS 2 b and PUL were more responsive to sucrose in IR 36. Interestingly, the GBSSI gene (Wx (a)) in IR 36 was highly activated by sucrose, but the GBSSI gene (Wx (b)) in T 65 was insensitive. In sucrose-independent regulation, AGPL 2, SSIIIa, BEI, BEIIb and ISA 1 genes in IR 36 were upregulated 1. 5 to 2 times more than those in T 65. Additionally, at least SSI and BEIIa might be regulated by unknown signals; that regulation pathway should be more activated in IR 36 than T 65. In this study, at least three regulatory pathways seem to be involved in SSG expression in rice endosperm, and all pathways were more active in IR 36. One of the factors leading to the high SAR of IR 36 seemed to be an increase in the sink potential...|$|E
