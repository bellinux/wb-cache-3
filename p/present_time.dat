5|$|According to The Wall Street Journal {{and diverse}} news sites, the 750 million units sold by Michael Jackson is an {{inflated}} figure that was initially claimed by Raymone Bain (2006), {{who was the}} singer's publicist at that time, without any factual evidence and probably {{in an effort to}} promote album sales. From 2006 until <b>present</b> <b>time,</b> several sources such as RIAA, Rolling Stone, and Time have claimed that Michael Jackson has sold 750 million units (or even 1 billion), however, Adrian Strain, a representative from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) has said that this figure is unreal.|$|E
5|$|Another {{genre of}} history writing {{produced}} during the Era of the Princes was the terse Ethiopian annal known as ya'alam tarik. These works attempted to list major world events {{from the time}} of the biblical Genesis until their <b>present</b> <b>time</b> in a universal history. For instance, the translated work of John of Nikiû explaining human history until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 642 became a canonical text in Ethiopian historiography. There are also chronological and genealogical lists of rulers and Orthodox Church patriarchs that include some elements of historical narrative.|$|E

5|$|From 1691 until around 1860 {{there had}} been no choir at the cathedral. There was also no organ for some time. Browne Willis' 1719 account {{describes}} the ruins of an organ given to the cathedral by Lady Kemysh of Cefn Mably found in the organ loft at that time. In 1860, Alfred Ollivant, who was then Bishop of Landaff, published a book, Some Account of the Condition of the Fabric of Llandaff Cathedral, from 1575 to the <b>present</b> <b>time,</b> intended to raise funds to restore the cathedral's choir and to purchase a new organ.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the NBA {{agreed with}} the National Basketball Players' Association to limit drafts to two rounds, an {{arrangement}} that has remained the same up the <b>present</b> <b>time.</b> Before each draft, an NBA Draft Lottery determines the first round selection order for the teams that missed the playoffs during the prior season. Teams can also trade their picks, which means that in some drafts teams may have {{more or less than}} two draft picks, although they must have at least one first-round pick every other year.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>present</b> <b>time,</b> Richard's son, Peter, {{continues}} to fight crime as Spider-Man. He pursues and apprehends Aleksei Sytsevich. Later, Peter meets with Gwen at {{their high school}} graduation ceremony and, insisting he keep his vow to her father, ends their relationship. Peter's childhood friend, Harry Osborn, returns to Manhattan to see his terminally-ill father, Norman, CEO of OsCorp. Norman explains his illness is genetic, and Harry is at the age where it first develops. Norman gives Harry a small device he claims contains his life's work. The next day, Norman dies and Harry is appointed the new OsCorp CEO.|$|E

5|$|The James Bay Project {{encompasses}} the La Grande project, {{which is located}} on the La Grande River and on its tributaries, such as the Eastmain River, in northwestern Quebec. The La Grande project was built in two phases; the first phase lasted twelve years from 1973 to 1985 and the second phase lasted from 1985 to <b>present</b> <b>time.</b> In all, the nine hydroelectric dams there produce over 16,500MW of electric power, with the Robert-Bourassa or La Grande-2 station generating over 5,600MW alone. In total, the project cost over C$20 billion to construct.|$|E
5|$|The revisionist {{tradition}} {{continues to}} the <b>present</b> <b>time,</b> through popular history books, web sites and wargames. New titles appear every year, propagating the myths first {{put forth by}} HIAG's propaganda efforts. Some of the books are amateur historical studies that focus solely on the military aspects of the Waffen-SS. Others are reprints of apologetic accounts by former Waffen-SS personnel. Adding to the volume of material are groups of international admirers who consider Waffen-SS to have been incorrectly judged by history.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{rotation}} is tidally locked to be synchronous {{with its}} orbit around Neptune: it keeps one face oriented toward the planet at all times. Its equator is almost exactly aligned with its orbital plane. At the <b>present</b> <b>time,</b> Triton's rotational axis is about 40° from Neptune's orbital plane, and hence {{at some point}} during Neptune's year each pole points fairly close to the Sun, almost like the poles of Uranus. As Neptune orbits the Sun, Triton's polar regions take turns facing the Sun, resulting in seasonal changes as one pole, then the other, moves into the sunlight. Such changes were observed in 2010.|$|E

5|$|While some of {{the laws}} from the Kitáb-i-Aqdas are {{applicable}} at the <b>present</b> <b>time,</b> others are dependent upon {{the existence of a}} predominantly Bahá'í society, such as the punishments for arson or murder. The laws, when not in direct conflict with the civil laws of the country of residence, are binding on every Bahá'í, and the observance of personal laws, such as prayer or fasting, is the sole responsibility of the individual.|$|E
5|$|A few {{theoretical}} physicists {{have argued}} that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of consciousness, but that quantum theory may provide the missing ingredients. Several theorists have therefore proposed quantum mind (QM) theories of consciousness. Notable theories falling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of Karl Pribram and David Bohm, and the Orch-OR theory formulated by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose. Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness, as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness. None of the quantum mechanical theories has been confirmed by experiment. Recent publications by G. Guerreshi, J. Cia, S. Popescu, and H. Briegel could falsify proposals {{such as those of}} Hameroff, which rely on quantum entanglement in protein. At the <b>present</b> <b>time</b> many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing.|$|E
