5|$|Chinese {{trade with}} the Roman Empire, {{confirmed}} by the Roman desire for silk, started in the 1st century BC. The Romans knew of wild silk harvested on Cos (coa vestis), {{but they did not}} at first make the connection with the silk that was produced in the Pamir Sarikol kingdom. There were few direct trade contacts between Romans and Han Chinese, as the rival Parthians and Kushans were each <b>protecting</b> <b>their</b> lucrative role as trade intermediaries.|$|E
5|$|Company Ambulance – Many large {{factories}} and other industrial centres, such as chemical plants, oil refineries, breweries and distilleries, have ambulance {{services provided by}} employers {{as a means of}} <b>protecting</b> <b>their</b> interests and the welfare of their staff.

5|$|The first {{armoured}} cruisers {{had been}} built in the 1870s, as an attempt to give armour protection to ships fulfilling the typical cruiser roles of patrol, trade protection and power projection. However, the results were rarely satisfactory, as the weight of armour required for any meaningful protection usually meant that the ship became almost as slow as a battleship. As a result, navies preferred to build protected cruisers with an armoured deck <b>protecting</b> <b>their</b> engines, or simply no armour at all.|$|E
5|$|By 1700, the European {{states had}} enough troops and ships at their disposal, {{following}} {{the end of}} a number of wars, to begin better <b>protecting</b> <b>their</b> important colonies in the West Indies and in the Americas, without relying on the aid of privateers. Pirates based in the Caribbean were chased from the seas by a new British squadron based at Port Royal, Jamaica, and a smaller group of Spanish privateers, sailing from the Spanish Main, known as the Guarda de Costa, or simply the Guarda.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} {{the residents}} formed the Vigilance Association {{with the intent}} of <b>protecting</b> <b>their</b> interests during the establishment of the new capital territory. Legal challenges to the resumption of the land were unsuccessful, but the Vigilance Association did win some concessions: the government agreed to pay for the improvements to the land, and did so at the value when the land was acquired; and the landowners gained the right of first refusal on their old properties when they were put up for lease. As of 2010 all residential land in the ACT is held on a 99-year crown lease.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Nhu {{prepared}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces commanded by Colonel Lê Quang Tung— {{who took his}} orders directly from Nhu and not the senior generals— for the raids. An American-trained outfit created to fight the Việt Cộng, the Special Forces were better-equipped, better-trained and better-paid than the regular army, but were used by the Ngô family as a private army for repressing dissidents and <b>protecting</b> <b>their</b> rule, rather than fighting for the national interest. As such, they spent {{the majority of their}} time in Saigon warding off coup attempts. Tung brought more Special Forces into Saigon, bringing the total from two to four battalions in the capital.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cultural}} disputes {{exist between}} Malaysia and neighbouring countries, notably Indonesia. The two countries {{have a similar}} cultural heritage, sharing many traditions and items. However, disputes have arisen over things ranging from culinary dishes to Malaysia's national anthem. Strong feelings exist in Indonesia about <b>protecting</b> <b>their</b> national heritage. The Malaysian government and the Indonesian government have met to defuse some of the tensions resulting from the overlaps in culture. Feelings are not as strong in Malaysia, where most recognise that many cultural values are shared.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 22 August 1795 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars between a squadron of four British Royal Navy frigates and two frigates and a cutter from the Navy of the Batavian Republic. The engagement was fought off the Norwegian coastal island of Eigerøya, then in Danish Norway, the opposing forces engaged in <b>protecting</b> <b>their</b> respective countries' trade routes to the Baltic Sea. War between Britain and the Batavian Republic began, undeclared, {{in the spring of}} 1795 after the Admiralty ordered British warships to intercept Batavian shipping following the conquest of the Dutch Republic by the French Republic in January 1795.|$|E

5|$|The {{deployment}} to East Timor {{highlighted the}} limits of the Australian Defence Force and the need for an Army Reserve that could effectively provide deployable capabilities and individuals to round-out to the Regular Army in times of heavy operational commitment. As such, in late 2000 the government did what many governments had toyed with since the formation of the citizen force almost a hundred years earlier: enacting legislation that enabled the call-up of Reservists to full-time service in circumstances that fell short of a full scale defence emergency, thereby allowing their deployment overseas, while also <b>protecting</b> <b>their</b> employment and providing remuneration to employers.|$|E
5|$|The {{lawsuits}} {{damaged the}} public {{image of the}} Wright brothers, who were generally regarded before this as heroes. Critics said the brothers were greedy and unfair and compared their actions unfavorably to European inventors, who worked more openly. Supporters said the brothers were <b>protecting</b> <b>their</b> interests and were justified in expecting fair compensation for the years of work leading to their successful invention. Their 10-year friendship with Octave Chanute, already strained by tension over how much credit, if any, he might deserve for their success, collapsed after he publicly criticized their actions.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} {{handling of}} Luftflotte 3 {{was not good}} either. The escorting fighters of StG 77 were stretched too far across a 30-mile front. By chance half of the defending fighters went into action {{against one of the}} attacking Ju 87 groups with disastrous results for the group concerned. The German fighters, which outnumbered the RAF units by 2:1, were unable to protect the Stuka units. Had the targets been closer together, the concentration of fighters would have allowed the Germans to destroy more RAF fighters in the air, while <b>protecting</b> <b>their</b> charges.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{protection}} of the National Guard, some miners returned to work and some strikebreakers, imported from the eastern coalfields, joined them as Guard troops <b>protecting</b> <b>their</b> movements. In February 1914, {{a substantial portion of the}} troops were withdrawn, but a large contingent remained at Ludlow. On April 20, 1914, a general fire-fight occurred between strikers and troops, which was antagonized by the troops and mine guards. The camp was burned, resulting in 15 women and children, who hid in tents at the camp, being burned to death. Costs to both mine operators and the union were high. This incident brought unwanted national attention to Colorado.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of the cormorants and some terns, and in common with most other birds, all seabirds have waterproof plumage. However, compared to land birds, they have far more feathers <b>protecting</b> <b>their</b> bodies. This dense plumage is better able to protect the bird from getting wet, and cold is kept out by a dense layer of down feathers. The cormorants possess a layer of unique feathers that retain a smaller layer of air (compared to other diving birds) but otherwise soak up water. This allows them to swim without fighting the buoyancy that retaining air in the feathers causes, yet retain enough air to prevent the bird losing excessive heat through contact with water.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Seacology {{launched}} its largest-ever project, a $3.4 million initiative to protect all of Sri Lanka's remaining mangrove forests and restore many degraded ones. Through Sri Lanka-based NGO Sudeesa (also {{known as the}} Small Fishers Federation of Lanka), Seacology is funding a significant expansion of that organization's existing microloan and job-training programs. In exchange, the beneficiaries of these programs must agree to assist in <b>protecting</b> <b>their</b> local mangrove habitats. The training is designed in part to give low-income women in these communities alternatives to harvesting mangroves, a subsistence activity that {{has contributed to the}} forests' degradation. The project also established three large nursery facilities to grow several species of mangroves, to be replanted in areas previously cleared for aquaculture and other unsustainable development, as well as several areas destroyed during the Sri Lankan Civil War.|$|E
