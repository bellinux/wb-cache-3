I know the cabin her uncle lived in, in the mines; I knew his partners, too; also I came near knowing her husband before she married him, and I DID know the {{abandoned}} shaft where a <b>premature</b> <b>blast</b> went off and he went {{flying through the air}} and clear down to the trail and hit an Indian in the back with almost fatal consequences.|$|E

25|$|At least 23 {{accidental}} deaths {{occurred during}} {{construction of the}} second section, the main causes being <b>premature</b> <b>blasting,</b> injuries from rock falls and cave-ins, and falling. One man, Giovanni Zappa, fell 250m into the Barron Gorge in September 1888. Other deaths resulted from malaria, ticks, scrub typhus (mites), dysentery, fevers, and snakes. Hundreds of men were injured, but despite {{the existence of the}} Queensland Employers' Liability Act 1886, only one worker was compensated. Other labour issues {{led to the formation of}} a trade union - the United Sons of Toil, which called a strike in late 1890.|$|R
50|$|The {{technique}} {{operates on}} the principle of using a sustained offense as a means of forcing an opponent to move on the defensive.The move consists of putting both fists perpendicularly above one another and moving them in a circular motion (starting forward and downward) in a tight formation with fists kept facing forward bent at the wrist outward and clenched vertically, compounded with running toward an opponent. This is intended to throw off the opponent while effectively dealing a barrage of centrifugally forced punches {{toward the center of the}} opponent's mass. A poorly executed or <b>premature</b> straight <b>blast</b> attack can usually be effectively countered by one or more kicks to the attacker's shin, knee, or groin.|$|R
5000|$|Track workers under foreman Coulson were laying rails of 80 lbs kg per yard for {{the branch}} in May 1884, and laborer [...] "Blind Davy" [...] Weikert was blinded by a <b>premature</b> {{dynamite}} <b>blast.</b> The Round Top Station's warehouse was completed June 21, 1884. After being surveyed in May, the branch's {{connection to the}} HJ, H&GRR was being completed on July 22, 1884 [...] "just beyond the Cashman limestone kilns" [...] and a siding along Fairfield Road had been completed along with a switch at the PA National Guard commissary (the 1913 siding held eight carloads of ice). The [...] "dummy" [...] Baldwin steam engine had begun excursions [...] "to the hill" [...] in June 1884 and could carry about 40 passengers (the branch's [...] "dinky" [...] could carry about 10). The G&HRR published a Gettysburg Battlefield guidebook with 1884 images by [...] "the great landscape photographer, Mr. Bell, of Philadelphia".|$|R
40|$|Unexpected {{discharge}} of blast {{gas in the}} early stages of casting from a blast furnace has a significant impact on the furnace operations, resulting in premature plugging of the tap hole and consequently poorer stability, productivity and overall efficiency of the furnace. A physical modelling study has been carried out to understand the mechanism of the gas/slag interface instability during hearth drainage using a Hele-Shaw viscous flow model. Mineral oil and ZnClâ‚‚ aqueous solution were used to simulate molten slag and iron, respectively. The research is aimed at exploring the possibility of viscous fingering being the cause of the <b>premature</b> emission of <b>blast</b> gas from the taphole. The experimental evidence showed that viscous fingering could take place, resulting in the premature release of the blast gas, if the gas/slag interface descending velocity in the region near the taphole is greater than the critical value for viscous finger formation. Viscous fingering is likely to cause the unexpected early blast gas discharge under certain hearth conditions during casting...|$|R
