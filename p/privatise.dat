Yorkshire Rider branded its buses with a depot strapline. Once <b>privatised,</b> SYT (as Mainline) introduced local brands (later dropped).

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1990, Chicago Bridge & Iron and Wormald International {{had both}} sold their shares in ASC.

On 5 April 2000, the shares in ASC held by Kockums were bought out and the company was nationalised, despite a trend {{at the time to}} <b>privatise</b> government-owned companies. At the end of 2003, a contract to maintain the Collins class worth $3.5billion over 25years was awarded to ASC.|$|E
25|$|Former Prime Minister Sir Mekere Morauta {{tried to}} restore {{integrity}} to state institutions, stabilise the kina, restore stability {{to the national}} budget, <b>privatise</b> public enterprises where appropriate, and ensure ongoing peace on Bougainville following the 1997 agreement which ended Bougainville's secessionist unrest. The Morauta government had considerable success in attracting international support, specifically gaining {{the backing of the}} IMF and the World Bank in securing development assistance loans. Significant challenges face Prime Minister Sir Michael Somare, including gaining further investor confidence, continuing efforts to <b>privatise</b> government assets, and maintaining the support of members of Parliament.|$|E
40|$|The role of {{ownership}} in performance {{of financial institutions}} is under-examined yet remains a topical issue. Whilst ownership changes in the banking sector have been evaluated in several studies, the link with other sectors {{has not been a}} focus of in depth analysis. A controlled comparison of performance between <b>privatising</b> banks and insurance firms in Australia is undertaken via a ‘meso’ approach of pairing <b>privatising</b> with comparator private institutions across the event period. Performance is evaluated using commercial CAMEL indicators and applying Wilcoxon rank tests (Otchere and Chan 2003) which provide statistically robust findings in the small annual data samples available around the privatisation event. Performance of <b>privatising</b> and private institutions is found to be quite similar before and after the event. For the <b>privatising</b> banks, some indicator medians improved to commercial levels (CBA) or were mostly unchanged (Colonial). By contrast one of the <b>privatising</b> insurance institutions (Suncorp) was found to outperform the private insurance comparator while there was little difference for the other (GIO). <br /...|$|R

40|$|Administrative {{law in the}} Netherlands is {{applicable}} to any action {{with regard to the}} execution of public law power. Public law power is defined as authority to decide on the behaviour of another person. Application of administrative law is not entrusted to governmental bodies only. It can be applicable via acts of <b>privatised</b> organisations as well. The most important matter is though, the application of administrative law with regard to <b>privatised</b> organisations. <b>Privatised</b> organisations are largely regulated by administrative law. In the process of conversion from a state organisation towards a <b>privatised</b> company, administrative law {{is applicable}} in all stages. In this essay we will describe in what length and to what decree administrative law to protect the public interest is developed, as regulations on privatisation largely provide a mixture of private law and public law aspects. As regulations for privatisations are growing, a system of checks and balances is elaborating. Special supervisory bodies or special guarantees for private law bodies, obtaining a monopoly on a <b>privatised</b> market, are developing. These will be discussed as well. 1 General overview of administrative la...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies how <b>privatising</b> service {{provision}} (shifting control rights and con-tractual obligations to providers) aects accountability. There {{are two main}} eects. (1) Privatisation demotivates governments from investigating and responding to public de-mands, since providers then hold up service adaptations. (2) Privatisation demotivates the public from mobilising to pressure for service adaptations, since providers then indirectly holdup the public by in ating the government's cost of implementing these adaptations. So, when choosing governance mode, politicians may be biased towards <b>privatising</b> {{as a way to}} escape public attention; relatedly, <b>privatising</b> utilities may reduce public pressure and increase consumer prices...|$|R
