Disraeli did not have things all his own way: he intended that Batum be demilitarised, but the Russians obtained their <b>preferred</b> <b>language,</b> and in 1886, fortified the town. Nevertheless, the Cyprus Convention ceding the island to Britain was announced during the congress, and again made Disraeli a sensation.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{adoption}} as {{the court}} language of Philip II of Macedon's regime, authors of ancient Macedonia wrote their works in Koine Greek, the lingua franca of late Classical and Hellenistic Greece. Rare textual evidence indicates that the native Macedonian language was either a dialect of Greek similar to Thessalian Greek and Northwestern Greek, or a language closely related to Greek. The vast majority of surviving inscriptions from ancient Macedonia were written in Attic Greek and its successor Koine. Attic (and later Koine) Greek was the <b>preferred</b> <b>language</b> of the Ancient Macedonian army, although {{it is known that}} Alexander the Great once shouted an emergency order in Macedonian to his royal guards during the drinking party where he killed Cleitus the Black. Macedonian became extinct in either the Hellenistic or the Roman period, and entirely replaced by Koine Greek.|$|E
5|$|Italian, {{and to some}} extant Latin, {{was used}} as the main {{functioning}} language of the courts throughout the periods of the knights, French occupation, British protectorate, until at least 1879 when the courts had already moved out of the building. The French language was established as the sole official language, however an exception was given to the courts as Italian prevailed for legal jargon. Efforts by the British to use English during the protectorate and the early colonisation of Malta failed, mostly due to the resistance by the nobility. The supreme court proceeding were suggested to take place with the use of English, to encourage the study and use of English by judges and lawyers, but the efforts were futile. Both during the French occupation and English period, the supreme court decisions were published in Italian and the other <b>preferred</b> <b>language</b> of the government; French during the French period and English during the British periods. The Maltese language was never discussed to be used at the courts when housed in the Castellania. The language question was not solved until the 20th century, when the building had for long changed purpose.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} people for whom Auslan is their primary or <b>preferred</b> <b>language</b> is very {{difficult}} to determine. According to the 2001, 2006 and 2011 Censuses published by Australian Bureau of Statistics, the population of Auslan users in Australia have increased by 54.57% thus debunking the speculation that Auslan is an endangered language. As of 2011, the Census population of Auslan users in Australia is 9723 - an increase of 4417 new users from the 2001 Census. Based on this statistical trajectory, it is expected that the {{number of people}} for whom Auslan is their primary or <b>preferred</b> <b>language</b> could exceed 12000 in the 2016 Census. Although the number is increasing, approximately 5% of all Auslan users are acquiring the language from their parents with the rest learning the language from other peers such as friends or colleagues later in life.|$|E

25|$|Chinese {{varieties}} (classified as dialects by the Singapore government), {{with the}} exception of Mandarin, have been in steep decline since the independence of Singapore in 1965. This is in part due to the Speak Mandarin Campaign that was launched in 1979. As part of the campaign, all programmes on TV and radio using non-standard varieties were stopped. Speeches in Hokkien by the prime minister were discontinued to prevent giving conflicting signals to the people. By the late 1980s, Mandarin managed to some extent, to replace these varieties as the <b>preferred</b> <b>language</b> for communication in public places, such as restaurants and public transport.|$|E
25|$|The Cocoa {{frameworks}} {{are written}} in Objective-C, and hence that is the <b>preferred</b> <b>language</b> for developing Cocoa applications.

Cocoa's need for runtime binding means many of Cocoa's key features are not available with Java. In 2005, Apple announced that the Java bridge was to be deprecated, meaning that features added to Cocoa in macOS versions later than 10.4 would not be added to the Cocoa-Java programming interface.|$|E
25|$|After the Union of Crowns in 1603, the Scottish Court {{moved with}} James VI & I to London and English {{vocabulary}} {{began to be}} used by the Scottish upper classes. With the introduction of the printing press, spellings became standardised. Scottish English, a Scottish variation of southern English English, began to replace the Scots language. Scottish English soon became the dominant language. By the end of the 17th century, Scots had practically ceased to exist, at least in literary form. While Scots remained a common spoken language, the southern Scottish English dialect was the <b>preferred</b> <b>language</b> for publications from the 18th century to the present day.

25|$|In {{effect the}} populations of both Assyria and Babylonia had become an ethnic mix of native Akkadians and Arameans. Even though Aramaic was the common tongue of the empire, Akkadian {{continued}} to be the <b>preferred</b> <b>language</b> of royalty and the elites. Rulers, royalty and elites were all trained to speak both Aramaic and Akkadian until, by the 7th century BC, the ruling class was fully bilingual. The rest of the empire was divided into two sects: those who spoke Aramaic and those who spoke Akkadian. Generally, the common people and traders were also bilingual but Aramaic continued to dominate the empire outside Assyria proper. As the Empire fell, only the elite knew {{how to read and}} write the Akkadian script. The savage sacking of Nineveh and Assur, as well as numerous other Assyrian cities, ensured that few of these elites survived to pass on the language, but some cities such as Arrapkha were spared the destruction.|$|E
25|$|Austronesian {{languages}} {{have been}} spoken in the Philippines {{for thousands of}} years. According to a 2014 study by Mark Donohue of the Australian National University and Tim Denham of Monash University, there is no linguistic evidence for an orderly north-to-south dispersal of the Austronesian languages from Taiwan through the Philippines and into Island Southeast Asia (ISEA). Many adopted words from Sanskrit were incorporated during the strong wave of Indian (Hindu-Buddhist) cultural influence starting from the 5th century BC, in common with its Southeast Asian neighbours. Starting {{in the second half}} of the 16th century, Spanish was the official language of the country for the more than three centuries that the islands were governed through Mexico City on behalf of the Spanish Empire. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Spanish was the <b>preferred</b> <b>language</b> among Ilustrados and educated Filipinos in general. Significant agreements exist, however, on the extent Spanish use beyond that. It has been argued that the Philippines were less hispanized than Canaries and America, with Spanish only being adopted by the ruling class involved in civil and judicial administration and culture. Spanish was the language of only approximately ten percent of the Philippine population when Spanish rule ended in 1898. As a lingua franca or creole language of Filipinos, major languages of the country like Chavacano, Cebuano, Tagalog, Kapampangan, Pangasinan, Bicolano, Hiligaynon, and Ilocano assimilated many different words and expressions from Castilian Spanish.|$|E
