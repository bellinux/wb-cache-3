50|$|The {{acquisition}} of skill requires practice. Merely repeating a task alone, however, does not ensure the {{acquisition of}} a skill. Skill acquisition is achieved when an observed behaviour has changed due to experience or practice. This is known as learning and is not directly observable. The information processing model, which incorporates this idea of experience, proposes that skills develop from the interaction of four components central to information processing. These components include: processing speed, {{the rate at which}} information is processed in our processing system; breadth of declarative knowledge, the size of an individual's factual information store; breadth of procedural skill, the ability to perform the actual skill; and processing capacity, synonymous with working memory. The processing capacity is of importance to procedural memory because through the process of <b>proceduralization</b> an individual stores procedural memory. This improves skill usage by linking environmental cues with appropriate responses.|$|E
50|$|Thinkers have {{produced}} several theories concerning how learners use their internal L2 knowledge structures to comprehend L2 input and produce L2 output. One {{idea is that}} learners acquire proficiency in an L2 {{in the same way}} that people acquire other complex cognitive skills. Automaticity is the performance of a skill without conscious control. It results from the gradated process of <b>proceduralization.</b> In the field of cognitive psychology, Anderson expounds a model of skill acquisition, according to which persons use procedures to apply their declarative knowledge about a subject in order to solve problems. On repeated practice, these procedures develop into production rules that the individual can use to solve the problem, without accessing long-term declarative memory. Performance speed and accuracy improve as the learner implements these production rules. DeKeyser tested the application of this model to L2 language automaticity. He found that subjects developed increasing proficiency in performing tasks related to the morphosyntax of an artificial language, Autopractan, and performed on a learning curve typical of the acquisition of non-language cognitive skills. This evidence conforms to Anderson’s general model of cognitive skill acquisition, supports the idea that declarative knowledge can be transformed into procedural knowledge, and tends to undermine the idea of Krashen that knowledge gained through language “learning” cannot be used to initiate speech production.|$|E
40|$|Resilience {{engineering}} concepts can complement <b>proceduralization</b> {{of complex}} sociotechnical systems (STS). <b>Proceduralization</b> aims at defining precise and quantified system objectives, and at defining {{a process that}} describes and prescribes how to achieve those objectives. Although <b>proceduralization</b> has been successfully implemented to capture knowledge and experience, it is limited when the unexpected and unforeseen occurs. Resilience engineering focuses on this drawback and seeks for concepts to enable adaptive responses in these situations. We propose a team reflection process to enhance resilience of a rail STS, complementing its <b>proceduralization.</b> In the present study, we describe how rail signallers used team reflection, supported by a tool that allowed in-depth post-shift inspection of train movements. A near accident, occurring during a one-week observation, is described and used for two purposes. First, it {{was used as an}} example to explain the usage of the support tool. Second, it was used as a reference case of topics playing a role in evolving accidents. The analysis showed that the topic categories discussed during the team reflections were similar to the incident categories. This means that relevant topics are available, when things go right, to learn from and anticipate on. In addition, we showed that rail signallers, {{over the course of the}} observations, increasingly analysed and reasoned about their work.

Consecutively, recent bottleneck in graphics industry has been changing from the “means” to the “objects”, in other words, from the technology to the content. In particular, architectural models have always {{played an important role in}} areas like computer graphics, virtual environments, and urban planning. Because of the proliferation of such areas, the demand for city-scale 3 D urban models has significantly increased, as well as the availability of 3 D data sets of buildings and other urban structures. ^ One option is to manually create such content, however humans are expensive and slow, and more and more are needed as the content to be created explodes for movies, games, and visualizations. Another option is to efficiently re-use the existing large set of 3 D polygonal models available from public databases, created by scans, images, time-of-flight cameras, manual modeling, etc. However the results of these approaches usually lack high-level grouping or segmentation information which hampers efficient re-use and synthesis. ^ Procedural models are known to be an effective solution to create massive amount of content from powerful and compact parameterized representations. While procedural modeling provides compelling architectural structures, creating detailed and realistic buildings needs time and extensive coding as well as significant domain expertise. In other words, procedural modeling is a solution for content creation, however lack of artistic control and the need for domain expertise make it challenging. ^ Observing the content creation problem and the challenges of procedural modeling, we identified and developed a set of <b>proceduralization</b> tools, that convert existing models into an easy to manipulate procedural form and allow quick synthesis of visually similar objects. The central idea of our research is that we can automate and assist modeling and creation tasks by <b>proceduralization</b> of existing models such as architectural meshes, building point clouds, or textured urban areas. The geometrical and visual information hidden in already existing models actually contain high-level semantic and structural information, so a <b>proceduralization</b> framework can reveal such information for a variety of purposes. ^ Our <b>proceduralization</b> framework for urban spaces allows the re-use of existing models in various formats by first conducting shape analysis methods on such models to find and exploit the repetitions and similarities revealing the hidden high-level structural information, and then using grammar discovery methods on those components to extract a representative grammar (or a procedural form) of the model. We have shown that the structural information and repetitions inside already existing models can be exploited to obtain the high-level representation hidden in such models for making the design and modeling of urban content more efficient and intuitive. Initial applications of our work enables the benefits of procedural modeling on existing models such as compression, rendering, and content generation. Additionally, we have proposed new applications of such procedural representations, including reconstruction of incomplete models, geo-localization within urban areas, and structure preserving synthesis systems. We expect our effort will enlighten the artists 2 ̆ 7 and designers 2 ̆ 7 creation process by converting the existing modeling tools into faster, easier to implement, more interactive, and more intuitive procedural modeling systems, using the power of <b>proceduralization.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the regulation of}} mass metadata surveillance in Europe {{through the lens of}} the landmark judgment in which the Court of Justice of the European Union struck down the Data Retention Directive. The controversial directive obliged telecom and Internet access providers in Europe to retain metadata of all their customers for intelligence and law enforcement purposes, for a period of up to two years. In the ruling, the Court declared the directive in violation of the human rights to privacy and data protection. The Court also confirmed that the mere collection of metadata interferes with the human right to privacy. In addition, the Court developed three new criteria for assessing the level of data security required from a human rights perspective: security measures should take into account the risk of unlawful access to data, and the data’s quantity and sensitivity. While organizations that campaigned against the directive have welcomed the ruling, we warn for the risk of <b>proceduralization</b> of mass surveillance law. The Court did not fully condemn mass surveillance that relies on metadata, but left open the possibility of mass surveillance if policymakers lay down sufficient procedural safeguards. Such <b>proceduralization</b> brings systematic risks for human rights. Government agencies, with ample resources, can design complicated systems of procedural oversight for mass surveillance - and claim that mass surveillance is lawful, even if it affects millions of innocent people...|$|E

30|$|Several {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} tasks that are well-learned {{tend to be more}} resistant to the effects of stress than those that are less-well-learned. Extended practice leads to commitment of the knowledge to long term memory and easier retrieval, as well as automaticity and the <b>proceduralization</b> of tasks. These over-learned behaviors tend to require less attentional control and fewer mental resources [39],[40], which facilitates enhanced performance and yields greater resistance to the negative effects of stress—i.e., overlearned behaviors {{are less likely to be}} forgotten and more easily recalled under stress. Van Overschelde and Healy [41] found that linking new facts learned under stress with preexisting knowledge sets helps to diminish the negative effect of stress. On the other hand, there is also a tendency for people under stress to “fall-back” to early-learned behavior [42]-[44]—even less efficient or more error prone behavior than more recently-learned strategies—possibly because the previously learned strategies or knowledge are more well-learned and more available than recently acquired knowledge.|$|E

In the most interesting conflict management strategies, norms and social representations matter, but they are related to actors with a sense of purpose, a strategy, and political goals.
