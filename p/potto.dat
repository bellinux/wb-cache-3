5|$|The false <b>potto</b> (Pseudopotto martini) is a lorisoid primate of {{uncertain}} taxonomic status {{found in}} Africa. Anthropologist Jeffrey H. Schwartz named it in 1996 {{as the only}} species of the genus Pseudopotto {{on the basis of}} two specimens (consisting only of skeletal material) that had previously been identified as pottos (Perodicticus <b>potto).</b> The precise provenances of the two specimens are uncertain, but at least one may have come from Cameroon. Schwartz thought the false <b>potto</b> could even represent a separate family, but other researchers have argued that the supposed distinguishing features of the animal do not actually distinguish it from the potto; specifically, the false <b>potto</b> shares several features with West African pottos.|$|E
5|$|The {{lacrimal}} fossa, {{a depression}} in the skull, {{is located on the}} upper surface of the skull in most lorisids, but Schwartz found that it was further to the back, inside the orbit (eye socket) in the false <b>potto</b> and the slow loris. Sarmiento found this feature in 3 out of 11 pottos examined. The coronoid process of the mandible is said to be more hooked in the false <b>potto</b> than in the <b>potto</b> and slow loris.|$|E
5|$|The tail, {{according}} to Schwartz, {{is longer than}} in the <b>potto.</b> He does not provide measurements of the tail of AMZ 6698 and notes {{that at least one}} vertebra is missing, but Sarmiento counted 11 caudal vertebrae in an illustration of AMZ 6698 and Groves counted at least 15. However, Sarmiento found that the number of caudal vertebrae ranges from 5 to 17, with an average of 11, in pottos. Relatively long tails are also common in the western form of the <b>potto,</b> though {{according to}} Stump the tail of Pseudopotto is longer than any seen in pottos. The false <b>potto</b> allegedly has shorter spines on its cervical (neck) and first and second thoracic (chest) vertebrae, but Leon notes that this feature is also seen in western pottos. Schwartz writes that the false <b>potto</b> differs from pottos and angwantibos in lacking a bifid (two-tipped) spine on the second cervical vertebra, but Sarmiento found this feature in 3 out of 11 <b>potto</b> specimens he examined.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises (genus Nycticebus) are strepsirrhine {{primates}} and {{are related}} to other living lorisoids, such as slender lorises (Loris), <b>pottos</b> (Perodicticus), false <b>pottos</b> (Pseudopotto), angwantibos (Arctocebus), and galagos (family Galagidae), and to the lemurs of Madagascar. They are most {{closely related to the}} slender lorises of South Asia, followed by the angwantibos, <b>pottos</b> and false <b>pottos</b> of Central and West Africa. Lorisoids are thought to have evolved in Africa, where most living species occur; later, one group may have migrated to Asia and evolved into the slender and slow lorises of today.|$|R
50|$|While the <b>pottos</b> {{were with}} her, Cowgill {{published}} {{a number of}} journal articles on their anatomy, diet, reproduction, illnesses and recovery, and social behaviour. These publications constitute {{one of the few}} long-term studies of <b>pottos</b> in captivity.|$|R
50|$|In a {{study of}} strepsirrhine {{cognition}} conducted in 1964, <b>pottos</b> were seen to explore and manipulate unfamiliar objects, but only when those objects were baited with food. They {{were found to be}} more curious than lorises and lesser bushbabies, but less so than lemurs. Ursula Cowgill, a biologist at Yale University who looked after six captive <b>pottos</b> for several decades, noticed they appeared to form altruistic relationships. The captive <b>pottos</b> were seen to spend time with a sick companion and to save food for an absent one. However, there is no confirmation this behaviour occurs in the wild.|$|R
5|$|The false <b>potto</b> {{generally}} {{resembles a}} small <b>potto,</b> {{but according to}} Schwartz it differs in having a longer tail, shorter spines on its neck and chest vertebrae, a smaller, less complex spine on the second neck vertebra, an entepicondylar foramen (an opening in the humerus, or upper arm bone), a lacrimal fossa (a depression in the skull) that is located inside the eye socket, a smaller upper third premolar and molar, and higher-crowned cheekteeth, among other traits. However, many of these traits are variable among pottos; for example, one researcher found entepicondylar foramina in {{almost half of the}} specimens in his sample of pottos.|$|E
5|$|One of the specimens, AMZ 6698, is {{an adult}} female {{that lived in}} Zürich Zoo. It is {{represented}} by a virtually complete skeleton, but the skin was not preserved. According to Schwartz, the skeleton shows signs of osteoporosis and periodontitis (common in zoo animals), but not of other pathologies or abnormalities. The right teeth were removed before Schwartz studied the specimen. Schwartz selected this specimen as the holotype. The other specimen, AMZ-AS 1730, is a subadult male collected in the wild, of which only the skull, including the mandible (lower jaw), was preserved. The dentition includes both permanent and deciduous teeth. Specimens of Pseudopotto are at least superficially similar to pottos, but according to Schwartz, they differ {{in a number of}} traits. Among lorisids, Schwartz saw similarities between the false <b>potto</b> and true pottos as well as angwantibos and slow lorises (Nycticebus). The false <b>potto</b> is comparable in size to the smallest pottos, but falls within their range of metrical variation; small size is also seen in western pottos.|$|E
5|$|Other {{distinguishing}} {{features of the}} false <b>potto</b> are in the dentition. Sarmiento notes, however, that captive specimens may develop abnormalities in the teeth and that some dental characters Schwartz uses are quite variable, sometimes even {{from one side of}} the same individual to another. The third upper molar (M3) is more reduced in the false <b>potto</b> than in any other prosimian, according to Schwartz, but Leon notes that western pottos also have a relatively small M3. The third upper premolar (P3) is also reduced, resembling the condition in the fork-marked lemurs (Phaner). Stump writes that small P3s are also common in western pottos, although the false potto's P3 is shaped differently. Groves notes that P1 is quite long, another point of similarity with the fork-marked lemurs. The lower premolars are compressed laterally in Pseudopotto, the cusps on the cheekteeth are higher, and the cristid obliqua (a crest connected to the protoconid cusp) is at a relatively buccal position (in the direction of the cheeks).|$|E
50|$|As part {{of their}} courting rituals, <b>pottos</b> often meet for bouts of mutual grooming. This is {{frequently}} performed while they hang upside down from a branch. Grooming consists of licking, combing fur with the grooming claw and teeth, and anointing with the scent glands. <b>Pottos</b> mate face-to-face while hanging upside down from a branch.|$|R

25|$|The castle was {{established}} in the early 12th century at the edge of Castle Bank, a ridge between the villages of Faceby and Swainby, overlooking a small valley through which the road between Thirsk and Stokesley runs. In the 13th century, it was referred to variously as Hwernelton or <b>Potto</b> Castle (the village of <b>Potto</b> is part of the same parish). At the time of the Domesday Book, Whorlton was recorded as belonging to Robert, Count of Mortain, the half-brother of William the Conqueror. It subsequently passed to the de Meynell family, who founded the castle.|$|E

500|$|In 1998, {{the journal}} African Primates {{published}} three papers by primatologists on the false <b>potto.</b> Colin Groves affirmed {{that it was}} probably distinct from the <b>potto</b> and Simon Bearder cited it {{as an example of}} unrecognized taxonomic diversity in lorisids, but Esteban Sarmiento compared the new taxon to specimens of the <b>potto</b> and found that the alleged distinctive traits of the false <b>potto</b> in fact fell within the range of variation of the <b>potto,</b> and that the false <b>potto</b> was probably not even a species distinct from Perodicticus <b>potto.</b> In 2000, primatologist B.S. Leon agreed that the false <b>potto</b> was not distinct from the subspecies Perodicticus <b>potto</b> <b>potto,</b> but noted that various forms of <b>potto</b> were distinct enough from each other that there may indeed be more than one species of <b>potto.</b> Opinions since then have been divided: a 2003 compilation of African primate diversity concluded that there was insufficient evidence that the false <b>potto</b> is a distinct species, the primate chapter of the 2005 third edition of Mammal Species of the World, written by Groves, listed Pseudopotto as a genus but noted that it was [...] "controversial"; and Schwartz continued to recognize the false <b>potto</b> as a genus in 2005. Also in 2005, primatologist David Stump reviewed some of the distinguishing features of Pseudopotto in the context of studying variation among pottos, and found that some but not all of the false potto's traits were found in some pottos, mainly western populations (subspecies <b>potto).</b>|$|E

40|$|Trade in {{primates}} {{is considered}} a major impediment to primate conservation globally. The bushmeat trade in West and Central Africa is considered largely unsustainable and {{represents one of the}} main threats to biodiversity. Furthermore, the use of primates in traditional practices and medicine includes a third of the African primate species. Little is known about the trade in the African mainland lorisiforms; <b>pottos,</b> angwantibos and galagos. Aiming to fill this knowledge gap we created an online survey, conducted a literature review, and analyzed CITES trade records, focusing on the last two decades. We obtained 188 questionnaire responses from researchers and people working in 31 different countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We found a total of 33 publications reporting on trade in African lorisiforms, and CITES records indicate that almost 2000 lorisiforms were traded internationally from African range countries. Fifty-three percent of respondents provided meaningful details about aspects of the trade in African lorisiforms from 50 % of the range countries. Galagos were reported by respondents in larger numbers than <b>pottos</b> and angwantibos, and mainly occurred in the pet trade. <b>Pottos</b> were the most frequently mentioned taxon in the literature, when all trade types were combined. Across all of the sources (online survey, literature and CITES database), trade in <b>pottos</b> and angwantibos was reported from 12 countries, and galagos from 23 countries. Trade was reported to occur mainly within rural settings (64 %), potentially indicating that demand is not high enough to fuel long distance trading. However, as seen in the Asian lorisiforms, once quantitative studies were conducted, the threat that trade posed became alarmingly apparent and is now considered a major impediment to their conservation. Our insight into the trade of African lorisiforms should be followed up with concerted studies, with an emphasis on quantifying trade to  the species level. Download the complete issue...|$|R
500|$|According {{to records}} in the Anthropological Institute and Museum, AMZ 6698, the holotype, is from [...] "Equatorial Africa", and AMZ-AS 1730 is from the [...] "Cameroons". According to mammalogist Ronald Nowak, these designations imply that the latter came either from modern Cameroon or far eastern Nigeria (British Cameroons) and the former from Cameroon or a {{neighboring}} state. In 1999, Simon Bearder claimed, citing a personal communication by C.Wild, that Pseudopotto had {{been seen in the}} wild and in 2001, ornithologist Christopher Bowden noted the occurrence of Pseudopotto on Mount Kupe in Cameroon, also citing C.Wild. However, the IUCN Red List notes that while sightings of the false <b>potto</b> at 820 to 940m (2690 to 3080ft) on Mount Kupe had been reported, surveys had failed to confirm its occurrence there, though pottos, some with long tails, had been found. The false <b>potto</b> is not listed separately from the <b>potto</b> in the Red List, because the evidence that it is a distinct species is considered insufficient.|$|E
500|$|In {{a series}} of <b>potto</b> (Perodicticus <b>potto)</b> skeletons in the {{collections}} of the Anthropological Institute and Museum of the University of Zurich at Irchel, anthropologist Jeffrey H. Schwartz recognized two specimens with traits he believed distinct from all pottos, and in 1996 he used these two specimens to describe a new genus and species of primate, Pseudopotto martini. The generic name, Pseudopotto, combines the element pseudo- (Greek for [...] "false") with [...] "potto", referring to superficial similarities between the new form and the <b>potto.</b> The specific name, martini, honors primatologist Robert D. Martin. The exact provenance of the two specimens is unknown, and one is represented by a complete skeleton (but no skin) and the other by a skull only. Schwartz placed both specimens in a single species, but noted that further study might indicate that the two represent distinct species. He thought the relationships of the new form were unknown and difficult to assess and did not assign it to any family, but provisionally placed it closest to the family Lorisidae, together with the <b>potto,</b> the angwantibos, and the lorises. The discovery, published in the Anthropological Papers of the American Museum of Natural History, was featured in Scientific American and Science; the Science account noted that Schwartz thought Pseudopotto may represent a new family of primates.|$|E
500|$|Little {{is known}} about the social {{structure}} of slow lorises, but they generally spend most of the night foraging alone. Individuals sleep during the day, usually alone but occasionally with other slow lorises. Home ranges of adults may significantly overlap, and those of males are generally larger than those of females. In the absence of direct studies of the genus, primatologist Simon Bearder speculated that slow loris social behavior {{is similar to that of}} the <b>potto,</b> another nocturnal primate. Such a social system is distinguished by a lack of matriarchy and by factors that allow the slow loris to remain inconspicuous and minimize energy expenditure. Vocal exchanges and alarm calls are limited; scent marking with urine is the dominant form of communication. Adult males are highly territorial and are aggressive towards other males. [...] Vocalizations include an affiliative (friendly) call krik, and a louder call resembling a crow's caw. When disturbed, slow lorises can also produce a low buzzing hiss or growl. To make contact with other individuals, they emit a single high-pitched rising tone, and females use a high whistle when in estrus.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are {{primates}} {{belonging to}} the suborder Strepsirrhini. Like other strepsirrhine primates, such as lorises, <b>pottos,</b> and galagos, they share ancestral traits with early primates. In this regard, lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates; however, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes, but evolved independently on Madagascar.|$|R

6000|$|During {{a recent}} {{discussion}} of this question {{in the pages of}} Nature, Mr. St. George Mivart adduces several examples of what he deems useless specific characters. Among them are the aborted index finger of the lemurine <b>Potto,</b> and the thumbless hands of Colobus and Ateles, the [...] "life-saving action" [...] of either of which he thinks incredible. These cases suggest two remarks. In the first place, they involve generic, not specific, characters; and the three genera adduced are somewhat isolated, implying considerable antiquity and the extinction of many allied forms. This is important, because it affords ample time for great changes of conditions since the structures in question originated; and without a knowledge of these changes we can never safely assert that any detail of structure could not have been useful. In the second place, all three are cases of aborted or rudimentary organs; and these are admitted to be explained by non-use, leading to diminution of size, a further reduction being brought about by the action of the principle of economy of growth. But, when so reduced, the rudiment might be inconvenient or even hurtful, and then natural selection would aid in its complete abortion; in other words, the abortion of the part would be useful, and would therefore be subject to the law of survival of the fittest. The genera Ateles and Colobus are two of the most purely arboreal types of monkeys, and {{it is not difficult to}} conceive that the constant use of the elongated fingers for climbing from tree to tree, and catching on to branches while making great leaps, might require all the nervous energy and muscular growth to be directed to the fingers, the small thumb remaining useless. The case of the <b>Potto</b> is more difficult, both because it is, presumably, a more ancient type, and its actual life-history and habits are completely unknown. These cases are, therefore, not at all to the point as proving that positive specific characters--not mere rudiments characterising whole genera--are in any case useless.|$|E

Evidently my hostess had made good use of her time. She came in immediately after we were seated, and I scarcely recognized her; for she was not only clean now, but good-looking as well, with that rich olive colour on her oval face, her black hair well arranged, and her dark eyes full of tender, loving light. She was now wearing a white merino dress with a quaint maroon-coloured pattern on it, and a white silk kerchief fastened with a gold brooch at her neck. It was pleasant to look at her, and, noticing my admiring glances, she blushed when she sat down, then laughed. The breakfast was excellent.
