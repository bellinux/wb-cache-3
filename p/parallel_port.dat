25|$|A {{new type}} of {{oscilloscope}} is emerging that consists of a specialized signal acquisition board (which can be an external USB or <b>parallel</b> <b>port</b> device, or an internal add-on PCI or ISA card).

25|$|The first {{hardware}} revision, the Lisa 2, {{was released}} in January 1984 and was priced between $3,495 and $5,495 US. It was much less expensive than the original model and dropped the Twiggy floppy drives {{in favor of a}} single 400k Sony microfloppy. It was possible to purchase the Lisa 2 with as little as 512k RAM. The Lisa 2/5 consisted of a Lisa 2 bundled with an external 5MB or 10MB hard drive. In 1984, {{at the same time the}} Macintosh was officially announced, Apple offered free upgrades to the Lisa 2/5 to all Lisa 1 owners, by swapping the pair of Twiggy drives for a single 3.5-inch drive, and updating the boot ROM and I/O ROM. In addition, the Lisa 2's new front faceplate was included to accommodate the reconfigured floppy disk drive. With this change, the Lisa 2 had the notable distinction of introducing the new Apple inlaid logo, as well as the first Snow White design language features. The Lisa 2/10 featured a 10MB internal hard drive (but no external <b>parallel</b> <b>port)</b> and a standard configuration of 1MB of RAM.|$|E

One popular program for converting Spectrum files from tape is Taper; it allows connecting a cassette tape player to the line in port of a sound card, or—through a simple home-built device—to the <b>parallel</b> <b>port</b> of a PC. Once in files on a host machine, the software can be executed on an emulator.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the lack}} of Amiga 2000-compatible {{internal}} expansion slots, there are many ports and expansion options. There are two DE9M Atari joystick ports for joysticks or mice, stereo audio (RCA connectors 1V p-p). There is a floppy drive port for daisy-chaining up to three extra floppy disk drives via an DB23F connector. The then-standard RS-232 serial port (DB25M) and Centronics <b>parallel</b> <b>port</b> (DB25F) are also included. The power supply is ( [...] , [...] ).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Parallel</b> <b>port</b> - Connecting {{through a}} <b>parallel</b> <b>port</b> is the slowest common {{transfer}} method. Early scanners had <b>parallel</b> <b>port</b> connections {{that could not}} transfer data faster than 70 kilobytes/second.

50|$|On-board I/O {{included}} a dual serial port UART and a 16-bit <b>parallel</b> <b>port.</b> The serial ports were implemented with an Intel 8274 UART and {{later with a}} NEC D7201C UART. Serial port A was wired as a Data Communications Equipment (DCE) port and had full modem control. It was also the console port if no graphical display was installed in the system. Serial port B was wired as a Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) port and had no modem control. Both serial ports {{could also be used}} as terminal ports and quite often were allowing 3 people to use one workstation, although two did not have graphical displays. The 16-bit <b>parallel</b> <b>port</b> was a special purpose port for connecting 8-bit <b>parallel</b> <b>port</b> keyboard and 8-bit <b>parallel</b> <b>port</b> optical mouse for workstations with graphical displays.
