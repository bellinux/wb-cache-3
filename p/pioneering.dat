5000|$|The 4th Hazara <b>Pioneers</b> (or Independent <b>Pioneer</b> Battalion) was a {{regiment}} of the British Indian Army {{formed in}} 1922, when the Indian army moved from single battalion regiments to multi-battalion regiments; the 106th Hazara <b>Pioneers</b> became the 1st Battalion 4th Hazara <b>Pioneers.</b> [...] The 4th Hazara <b>Pioneers</b> {{were one of}} four <b>Pioneer</b> units in the 1922 reorganisation, including the 1st Madras <b>Pioneers,</b> 2nd Bombay <b>Pioneers,</b> and 3rd Sikh <b>Pioneers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Pioneers</b> of the Revolution (Pionniers de la Révolution) was a youth {{organisation}} in Burkina Faso, modelled along {{the pattern of}} the <b>pioneer</b> movements typically operated by communist parties, such as the contemporary <b>Pioneers</b> of Enver, José Martí <b>Pioneer</b> Organisation and Agostinho Neto <b>Pioneer</b> Organisation. The <b>Pioneers</b> of the Revolution organised children of all ages. Much like many other young <b>pioneer</b> movements, such as the Vladimir Lenin All-Union <b>Pioneer</b> Organisation and the Young <b>Pioneers</b> of China, the most distinct sign of the <b>Pioneers</b> were their red scarves, joined by rudimentary uniforms and yellow berets.|$|R

50|$|Guidepost {{cells are}} {{specialized}} early differentiating sensory cells. These cells are essential in providing navigational information to <b>pioneer</b> axons. Arrays of <b>pioneer</b> neurons create short segments of <b>pioneer</b> axons extending distal to proximal within an appendage. The resulting trajectories {{are due to}} <b>pioneer</b> axons growing from guidepost to guidepost cells. In addition, <b>pioneer</b> axons can act as guidepost cells to more distant <b>pioneer</b> neurons. Studies that involved selective destruction of guidepost cells resulted in <b>pioneer</b> axons becoming unable to navigate normally to the CNS from the PNS. Instead, the <b>pioneer</b> axons assumed alternate configurations and followed different trajectories. In addition, without the guidepost cells, the <b>pioneer</b> axons did not find the stereotyped route that <b>pioneer</b> axons would normally navigate.|$|R

5|$|By the 1980s, protein {{sequencing}} had already transformed methods of scientific classification of organisms (especially cladistics) but biologists {{soon began to}} use RNA and DNA sequences as characters; this expanded the significance of molecular evolution within evolutionary biology, as the results of molecular systematics could be compared with traditional evolutionary trees based on morphology. Following the <b>pioneering</b> ideas of Lynn Margulis on endosymbiotic theory, which holds {{that some of the}} organelles of eukaryotic cells originated from free living prokaryotic organisms through symbiotic relationships, even the overall division of the tree of life was revised. Into the 1990s, the five domains (Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, and Monerans) became three (the Archaea, the Bacteria, and the Eukarya) based on Carl Woese's <b>pioneering</b> molecular systematics work with 16S rRNA sequencing.|$|E
