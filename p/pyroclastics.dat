The magnetite is classified as porphyry-like. Apatite is present as an accessory mineral in the lavas and is abundant in the intrusions. Iron-rich zones also formed in tuffs and lavas. Magnetite in the subvolcanic bodies exists in more massive crystals. The iron-containing rocks include lava flows, ash, and lapilli, as well as ore breccias.

These preceding centres have left andesitic lava flows that are partially dissected and agglomerates. The existence of a caldera at Taftan has been inferred. The table mountain Takht-i-Rostam [...] south of Taftan may be the remnant of a basalt extrusion, but it doesn't appear to be related to Taftan. A magma chamber may lie beneath the volcano.|$|E
500|$|The {{volcanic}} cone of Mount Thielsen {{sits atop}} prior shield volcanoes, {{and has a}} volume of [...] The cone was built from basaltic andesite, a common component of other shield volcanoes in the Oregon Cascades, breccia, and tuff, and it is intruded by dikes. A coalesced volcanic cone, it formed as <b>pyroclastics</b> erupted and fountains spewed lava. Glaciers cut and deformed the cone, eroding its upper sector. This erosion opened the interior of Thielsen for observation. Within the cone, lava flows, pyroclastic flow deposits, and strata of tephra, and volcanic ash, are easily visible. Potassium-argon dating of deposits in the cone suggests that Thielsen is at least 290,000 years old. Since its eruption stopped about 250,000to 100,000 years ago, the period of eruptive activity was short in time. The eruptions of the cone came in three phases: a period where lava flows built up its cone, one where more explosive pyroclastic eruptions took place, and the final period, in which pyroclastic and material of lava-based origin were erupted together forming a weak cone encircled by long deposits.|$|E
500|$|Of these deposits, Laco Norte is {{the largest}} and was {{probably}} separated from neighbouring Laquito by erosion. It is [...] thick and covers a surface area of [...] It was erupted from feeder dykes on its southern and eastern end and forms a table-shaped body on a spur, {{in the shape of}} a mesa. At Laco Norte, a structure of five layers is found: a basal andesite, ore in pyroclastic form, magnetite lava, <b>pyroclastics</b> which contain ore, and andesite at the top. Laco Sur has a similar morphology and dimensions of it has been mined. San Vicente Alto is a lava flow on the upper parts of the volcano (...) , and San Vicente Bajo is probably a lava dome (...) [...] Laquito ( [...] long and [...] wide) and Rodados Nortes (...) appear to be dykes, while Cristales Grandes ( [...] long and up to [...] wide) is more likely a vein and generally shows signs of hydrothermal formation. A magnetic layer of rock spreads north from the volcano, and a large magnetite body has been modelled beneath Pasos Blancos.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{modes of}} {{transport}} can be distinguished: <b>pyroclastic</b> flow, <b>pyroclastic</b> surge, and <b>pyroclastic</b> fall. During Plinian eruptions, pumice and ash are formed when silicic magma is fragmented in the volcanic conduit, because of decompression {{and the growth}} of bubbles. Pyroclasts are then entrained in a buoyant eruption plume which can rise several kilometers into the air and cause aviation hazards. Particles falling from the eruption clouds form layers on the ground (this is <b>pyroclastic</b> fall or tephra). <b>Pyroclastic</b> density currents, which are referred to as [...] "flows" [...] or [...] "surges" [...] depending on particle concentration and the level turbulence, are sometimes called glowing avalanches. The deposits of pumice-rich <b>pyroclastic</b> flows can be called ignimbrites.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pyroclastic</b> {{rocks are}} the product of {{explosive}} volcanism. They are often felsic (high in silica). <b>Pyroclastic</b> rocks are often the result of volcanic debris, such as ash, bombs and tephra, and other volcanic ejecta. Examples of <b>pyroclastic</b> rocks are tuff and ignimbrite.|$|R
40|$|In {{the upper}} and middle reaches of Amori River, the Kakuto <b>Pyroclastic</b> Flow Deposit, the Aira Beds 1 & 2, the Ata <b>Pyroclastic</b> Flow Deposit and the Tsumaya-Ito <b>Pyroclastic</b> Flow Deposits are {{distributed}} in ascending order. The altitude of top surface of the Kakuto <b>Pyroclastic</b> Flow Deposit becomes higher toward the west in this area. Altitude is about 60 meters above sea level around Kokubu alluvial plain and is about 220 meters in the eastern margin of Jusan-tsukabaru plateau though thickness of the <b>pyroclastic</b> flow deposit is almost same. This feature described above suggests that a peculiar mode of occurrence of the Kakuto <b>Pyroclastic</b> Flow Deposit coincides with the topography of the erosion surface of the basement rocks. On the other hand, the Ito <b>Pyroclastic</b> Flow Deposit fills up in the basin-like erosion surface of the underlying beds and the top surface of the <b>pyroclastic</b> flow deposit is rather flat. In the western and eastern parts of studied area the top surface of <b>pyroclastic</b> f﻿low deposit is preserved and Jusan-tsukabaru and Haruyama-bai plateaus are formed. In contrast to this, the <b>pyroclastic</b> flow deposit was eroded by river and deep valleys were cut in the center part of studied area. These valleys generally run in NE-SW and NW-SE directions. From this it may be inferred that they are eroded along tectonic faults...|$|R
500|$|The {{discovery}} of plumes at the volcanoes Pele and Loki {{were the first}} sign that Io is geologically active. Generally, these plumes are formed when volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide are ejected skyward from Io's volcanoes at speeds reaching , creating umbrella-shaped clouds of gas and dust. Additional material that might be found in these volcanic plumes include sodium, potassium, and chlorine. These plumes appear to be formed {{in one of two}} ways. Io's largest plumes, such as those emitted by Pele, are created when dissolved sulfur and sulfur dioxide gas are released from erupting magma at volcanic vents or lava lakes, often dragging silicate pyroclastic material with them. These plumes form red (from the short-chain sulfur) and black (from the silicate <b>pyroclastics)</b> deposits on the surface. Plumes formed in this manner are among the largest observed at Io, forming red rings more than [...] in diameter. Examples of this plume type include Pele, Tvashtar, and Dazhbog. Another type of plume is produced when encroaching lava flows vaporize underlying sulfur dioxide frost, sending the sulfur skyward. This type of plume often forms bright circular deposits consisting of sulfur dioxide. These plumes are often less than [...] tall, and are among the most long-lived plumes on Io. Examples include Prometheus, Amirani, and Masubi. The erupted sulfurous compounds are concentrated in the upper crust from a decrease in sulfur solubility at greater depths in Io's lithosphere.|$|E
500|$|The 3.6–2.3 mya Polan group, {{with ten}} {{dispersed}} volcanoes including Miño Volcano, {{is the largest}} group in the cluster and includes Tres Monos, La Luna, Cerro Polan, Chaihuiri, Miño Volcano and the lavas of the Aucanquilcha platform. Cerro Polan's (3.5–3 mya) eastern side is deeply dissected, and the exposed materials are heavily altered in the deeper sections. Lava fields to Polan's west and southwest (2.6 mya on one western field) are associated with it. La Luna (2.97–2.57) lies just east of Polan; these two volcanoes were probably one volcano in the past. La Luna has a lava dome surrounded by a glaciated but unaltered lava table. Cerro Tres Monos (3.4–2.78 mya) forms a northbound [...] long ridge with at least six vents. Hydrothermal alteration has affected some lavas and <b>pyroclastics</b> from Tres Monos, and the western side has lateral and terminal moraines. The Aucanquilcha platform (3.6–2.7 mya) sits underneath the main Aucanquilcha volcano, and its lava mostly flowed north. Its southern side is a [...] table with one hill, Cerro Campana, dated to 3.3 mya. The platform presumably forms {{one third of the}} total volume of the Aucanquilcha cluster and may have originated from a part of the ridge of the La Luna-Polan trend, now buried beneath Aucanquilcha.

500|$|Io's largest plumes, Pele-type plumes, {{are created}} when sulfur and sulfur dioxide gas exsolve from erupting magma at {{volcanic}} vents or lava lakes, carrying silicate pyroclastic material with them.

The exception to this is Pele, which {{is associated with a}} long-lived active lava lake eruption, though the plume is thought to be intermittent. The higher vent temperatures and pressures associated with these plumes generate eruption speeds of up to , allowing them to reach heights of between [...] Pele-type plumes form red (from short-chain sulfur) and black (from silicate <b>pyroclastics)</b> surface deposits, including large -wide red rings, as seen at Pele. The erupted sulfurous components of Pele-type plumes are thought {{to be the result of}} an excess amount of sulfur in Io's crust and a decrease in sulfur solubility at greater depths in Io's lithosphere. They are generally fainter than Prometheus-type plumes as a result of the low dust content, causing some to be called stealth plumes. These plumes are sometimes only seen in images acquired while Io is in the shadow of Jupiter or those taken in ultraviolet. The little dust that is visible in sunlit images is generated when sulfur and sulfur dioxide condense as the gases reach the top of their ballistic trajectories. That is why these plumes lack the dense central column seen in Prometheus-type plumes, in which dust is generated at the plume source. Examples of Pele-type plumes have been observed at Pele, Tvashtar, and Grian.|$|E
