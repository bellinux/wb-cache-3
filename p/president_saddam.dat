5|$|His {{appointment}} in September 1990 as Personal Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Humanitarian Assistance Relating to the Crisis between Iraq and Kuwait required diplomatic finesse. Iraq's <b>President</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein was deeply {{suspicious of the}} UN, and was loath {{to do anything that}} would benefit the country's Shia Muslims. Despite this, Prince Sadruddin was able to successfully negotiate with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz {{for the establishment of a}} UN relief program for tens of thousands of Shia Muslims trapped in worsening conditions in the marshlands of southern Iraq.|$|E

5|$|On August 1, 1990, Iraqi <b>President</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein {{sent the}} invading Iraqi forces into {{neighboring}} Kuwait, a small petroleum-rich state long claimed by Iraq {{as part of}} its territory. This invasion sparked the initiation of the Persian Gulf War and it brought worldwide condemnation. An estimated 140,000 Iraqi troops quickly took control of Kuwait City and moved on to the Saudi Arabia/Kuwait border. The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia by the U.S. Central Command, headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf, because of its important petroleum reserves.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to his}} August 1990 Invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi <b>President</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein {{was pushing}} OPEC to end {{overproduction}} and to send oil prices higher, {{in order to help}} OPEC members financially and to accelerate rebuilding from the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War. But these two Iraqi wars against fellow OPEC founders marked a low point in the cohesion of the organization, and oil prices subsided quickly after the short-term supply disruptions. The September 2001 Al Qaeda attacks on the US and the March 2003 US invasion of Iraq had even milder short-term impacts on oil prices, as Saudi Arabia and other exporters again cooperated to keep the world adequately supplied.|$|E
5|$|As Saeed was {{the vice}} {{president}} of the Iraq Football Association, which was headed by Uday Hussein, in the 1990s, there were many controversies about him being a Ba'athist and a Saddamist. He was also accused of being of a Palestinian descent, torturing players, giving positions to Tikritis. Accusations also went to say that Saeed was Uday's representative in robbing Kuwaitis in the 1991 Gulf War. Documents were put on the internet by some news agencies that suggest that Saeed, Najeh Humoud and Moayad Al-Badri worked for the Iraqi Intelligence Service in 2002 by gathering information on their targets. The documents included Saeed gathering information about Al-Badri when he was staying in Saudi Arabia before joining them himself. They also show the approval of the Personal Secretary of Former <b>President</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein, Abid Hamid Mahmud, of paying Saeed $50,000 after completing his mission and him signing on receiving $25,000. One of the documents showed him and Al-Badri executing a mission to monitor an alleged Israeli spy in Syria and showed him arresting Yahya Alwan before travelling to Saudi Arabia.|$|E

5|$|Saeed {{participated in}} the 1982 Gulf Cup of Nations in Abu Dhabi, scoring {{a total of five}} goals in the tournament: one against Oman, two against Bahrain, one against Saudi Arabia, and a last one against the UAE. Although Iraq {{finished}} 1st in the table, they withdrew from the competition by an order from Former <b>President</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein to motivate Kuwait who qualified to the 1982 FIFA World Cup by letting them win which led to scratching all of Iraq's results from the competition. In the same year, Saeed led Iraq to win their first ever gold medal in the Asian Games in the 1982 Asian Games, under the management of Ammo Baba, in New Delhi. In Iraq's first match, Saeed scored a goal in an easy 4–0 win over Burma. He also scored two goals in Iraq's 3–0 win against Nepal. In the quarterfinal, Iraq won over Japan with a single goal in extra time from Emad Jassim and, in the semifinal, they defeated Saudi Arabia with one goal. On 3 December, the final match was played between Iraq and Kuwait, where Saeed gained Iraq's gold medal when he scored the winning goal in the 82nd minute of the match with a through pass from Karim Mohammed Allawi.|$|E

25|$|Ignatieff's interventionist {{approach}} led him {{to support}} the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. According to Ignatieff, the United States had a duty to expend itself unseating Iraqi <b>president</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein {{in the interests of}} international security and human rights. Ignatieff initially accepted the argument of George W. Bush administration that containment through sanctions and threats would not prevent Hussein from selling weapons of mass destruction to international terrorists.

However, resistance to the invasion was fierce, stalling the Iraqi military's advance, and ultimately opening a window of opportunity for an Iranian counter-offensive.|$|E

25|$|The {{main body}} of {{coalition}} forces continued their drive {{into the heart of}} Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and Baghdad was occupied on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi army, including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack and capture of Tikrit on 15 April. Iraqi <b>president</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country. On 1 May, an end of major combat operations was declared, ending the invasion period and beginning the period of military occupation.|$|E
25|$|SAD/SOG teams also {{conducted}} high risk special reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines to identify senior leadership targets. These missions {{led to the}} initial assassination attempts against Iraqi <b>President</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein and his key generals. Although the initial air strike against Hussein was unsuccessful in killing the dictator, it was successful in effectively ending his ability to command and control his forces. Other strikes against key generals were successful and significantly degraded the command's ability to react to and maneuver against the U.S.-led invasion force. SAD operations officers were also successful in convincing key Iraqi army officers to surrender their units once the fighting started and/or not to oppose the invasion force.|$|E
25|$|Scott Ritter, a disaffected former arms inspector, {{asserted}} in his October 19, 2005 {{interview with}} Seymour Hersh that the US policy to remove Iraqi <b>president</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein from power started with US president George H.

The justification for sanctions was disarmament. The CIA offered the opinion that containing Hussein for six months {{would result in the}} collapse of his regime. According to Hersh, this policy resulted in the invasion and occupation of Iraq.|$|E

Primakov suggested that Saddam must hand over all Iraq's {{weapons of mass destruction}} to the United Nations, among other things. However, the Iraqi leader told Primakov he was confident that no harm would befall him personally—a belief that was later proven incorrect. Primakov later claimed Saddam's execution in 2006 was rushed to prevent him from revealing information on Iraq–United States relations that could embarrass the U.S. government.|$|E
25|$|Since 1982, the Iran-Iraq war gave Kurdish {{organizations}} in Northern Iraq {{a free hand}} because Iraq needed and moved its troops to the front in the South.
