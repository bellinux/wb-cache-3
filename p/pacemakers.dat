40|$|The risk of embolic stroke during sick sinus {{syndrome}} before cardiac <b>pacemaker</b> insertion is substantial, but stroke after <b>pacemaker</b> insertion has {{not been}} well studied. We observed 10 sick sinus syndrome patients who developed an ischemic stroke 4 days to 112 months after <b>pacemaker</b> insertion. Nine patients represented 6 % of the 156 ischemic stroke patients observed during a 30 -month period. Eight had a ventricular-demand <b>pacemaker,</b> one had a dual-chamber <b>pacemaker,</b> and one had an atrial-inhibited <b>pacemaker.</b> Six patients were in atrial fibrillation at stroke onset, but none had atrial fibrillation when the <b>pacemaker</b> was inserted. Six patients were taking aspirin, and one was anticoagulated when stroke occurred. Stroke in sick sinus syndrome after <b>pacemaker</b> insertion is not rare, and pacing {{does not appear to}} be protective.

5|$|It has {{not been}} shown that long term {{exposure}} to electromagnetic fields is harmful to human health, but it is recommended to avoid subjects who are pregnant or who utilize <b>pacemakers.</b> Guidelines place the limit for safe continuous exposure between 100μT and 200μT. The field and frequencies output by electromagnetic articulographs are comparable to those put out by computer terminals with the maximum measured being about 10μT.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pacemaker</b> {{endocarditis}} {{remains a}} rare but potentially life threatening complication of <b>pacemaker</b> implantation. This case illustrates a rare cause of <b>pacemaker</b> endocarditis, Serratia marcescens, the management difficulties {{that can be}} faced with such organisms, and the potential indolent nature of <b>pacemaker</b> lead associated endocarditis. A review of the current data for <b>pacemaker</b> endocarditis management suggests that treatment with antimicrobials alone {{is unlikely to be}} curative and explantation of the device is recommended in all cases of confirmed <b>pacemaker</b> endocarditis (by echocardiography, in correlation with the patient’s clinical condition and inflammatory markers) ...|$|R

5|$|All known {{isotopes}} of curium are radioactive {{and have}} a small critical mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. They predominantly emit α-particles, and the heat released in this process {{can serve as a}} heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, but this application is hindered by the scarcity, high cost, and radioactivity of curium isotopes. Curium is used in production of heavier actinides and of the 238Pu radionuclide for power sources in artificial <b>pacemakers.</b> It served as the α-source in the alpha particle X-ray spectrometers installed on several space probes, including the Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity Mars rovers and the Philae lander on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to analyze the composition and structure of the surface.|$|E
5|$|By {{this point}} in the year, the British Invasion—started by the Beatles' {{previous}} U.S. visit—was gathering momentum, and several more UK acts had come to the United States, including The Dave Clark Five, Billy J. Kramer, and Gerry & the <b>Pacemakers.</b> One third of all U.S. top ten hits in 1964 were by British acts. After the tour's final concert in New York, the Beatles were introduced to Bob Dylan, a meeting brought about at the instigation of the New York journalist Al Aronowitz, who arranged for Dylan to visit the Beatles at their hotel before they returned to the UK.|$|E
5|$|In {{the chronic}} stage, {{treatment}} involves managing the clinical {{manifestations of the}} disease. For example, <b>pacemakers</b> and medications for irregular heartbeats, such as the anti-arrhythmia drug amiodarone, may be life saving for some patients with chronic cardiac disease, while surgery may be required for megaintestine. The disease cannot be cured in this phase, however. Chronic heart disease caused by Chagas disease is now a common reason for heart transplantation surgery. Until recently, however, Chagas disease was considered a contraindication for the procedure, since the heart damage could recur as the parasite was expected to seize the opportunity provided by the immunosuppression that follows surgery.|$|E

5|$|After {{playing for}} more than 16 hours per week, the group were {{contacted}} by Allan Williams, who wanted {{them to go to}} Hamburg. Derry and the Seniors were successful there, and Williams wanted an additional group. As Storm and the group were committed to Butlins, they turned Williams' offer down (as did Gerry and the <b>Pacemakers)</b> so Williams sent the Beatles to Hamburg instead. After the summer season ended in early October 1960, Storm and the Hurricanes were free to travel to Hamburg, replacing Derry and the Seniors at the Kaiserkeller. They arrived in Hamburg on 1 October 1960, having negotiated to be paid more than the Seniors or the Beatles. They played five or six 90-minute sets every day alternating with The Beatles. Storm and The Hurricanes were later presented with a special certificate by Bruno Koschmider (the owner of the Kaiserkeller) for their performances.|$|E
5|$|Colin Manley from The Remo Four {{was also}} given a booking {{to play in}} the club, which was the only venue that young amateur bands could play at the time. Other artists and groups like Cilla Black, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, The Searchers and Gerry & The <b>Pacemakers</b> later played in the club. The Black Jacks became the {{resident}} group at The Casbah, although The Quarrymen occasionally played there again and often visited. It was in The Casbah Club that Lennon and McCartney persuaded Stuart Sutcliffe to buy a Höfner 500/5 model—known in Europe as a President bass—with the money he had won in the John Moores art exhibition. Even though the membership list later spiralled to over a thousand, Mona closed the club on 24 June 1962, with The Beatles as the last group to perform.|$|E

A total of 45 F-4As were built and none saw combat and most {{ended up as}} test or training aircraft. The USN and USMC received the first definitive Phantom, the F-4B which was equipped with the Westinghouse APQ-72 radar (pulse only), a Texas Instruments AAA-4 Infra-red search and track pod under the nose, an AN/AJB-3 bombing system and powered by J79-GE-8,-8A and -8B engines of 10,900lbf (48.5kN) dry and 16,950lbf (75.4kN) afterburner (reheat) with the first flight on 25 March 1961. 649 F-4Bs were built with deliveries beginning in 1961 and VF-121 <b>Pacemakers</b> receiving the first examples at NAS Miramar.|$|E
40|$|A new sensor capable {{to detect}} <b>pacemaker</b> pulses without using {{electrodes}} is presented. The magnetic field associated to the pacing current is sensed by a coil placed in {{proximity of the}} <b>pacemaker</b> wire, without the need of any electric connection with the patient. The new sensor is capable to provide accurate measurement of the occurrence and timing of <b>pacemaker</b> pulses. Hence, it provides important information about the <b>pacemaker</b> functioning, {{which can be used}} in patient???s monitoring and <b>pacemaker</b> device assessment. An in-vitro testing of the new sensor was carried out involving a real unipolar <b>pacemaker</b> immersed in saline solution. A wideband ECG circuit was also realized to record <b>pacemaker</b> pulses. The electrocardiographic signal and the output of the sensor were simultaneously recorded and compared. A microcontroller-based circuit provides accurate timing measurements of inter-pulse intervals and pulse duration and display them in real-time. Preliminary results suggest the possibility to use the new sensor to achieve prolonged, passive, unobstructive and wearable monitoring of <b>pacemaker</b> patients during their daily life activities. Accurate timing of the <b>pacemaker</b> pulse can also support standard ECG diagnosis and measurement of the residual charge of the <b>pacemaker</b> battery...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{accuracy}} {{with which}} a circadian <b>pacemaker</b> can entrain to an envi-ronmental 24 -h zeitgeber signal depends on (a) {{characteristics of the}} entraining signal and (b) response characteristics and intrinsic stability of the <b>pacemaker</b> itself. Position of the sun, weather conditions, shades, and behavioral variations (eye closure, burrowing) all modulate the light signal reaching the <b>pacemaker.</b> A simple model of a circadian <b>pacemaker</b> allows researchers to explore {{the impact of these}} factors on <b>pacemaker</b> accuracy. Accuracy is operationally defined as the reciprocal value of the day-to-day standard deviation of the clock times at which a reference phase (0) is reached. For the purpose of this exploration, the authors used a model <b>pacemaker</b> characterized solely by its momentary phase and momentary velocity. The average velocity determines the time needed to com-plete one <b>pacemaker</b> cycle and, therefore, is inversely proportional to <b>pacemaker</b> period. The model <b>pacemaker</b> responds to light by shifting phase and/or chang-ing its velocity. The authors assumed further that phase and velocity show small random fluctuations and that the velocity is subject to aftereffects. Aftereffect...|$|R
5|$|Williams, a 29-year-old Liverpool {{businessman}} and promoter, had sent his leading group, Derry and the Seniors (later known as Howie Casey and the Seniors) to Hamburg, {{where they were}} enjoying success, and wanted to send an additional group. He initially tried to send Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, but Storm and his group were committed to a Butlins holiday camp and turned Williams' offer down, as did Gerry and the <b>Pacemakers.</b> Williams started promoting concerts for The Beatles in May 1960, after they had played at his Jacaranda club in Liverpool, and offered The Beatles the Hamburg bookings. He booked them into Bruno Koschmider's Indra club in Hamburg for a season of bookings starting on 12 August 1960, but {{said that he was}} not impressed with them as a musical group, and hoped to find a better act to follow them.|$|E
5|$|Floodlights were {{installed}} {{at a cost}} of £12,000 in 1957. On 30 October they were switched on for the first time for a match against Everton to commemorate the 75-year anniversary of the Liverpool County Football Association. In 1963 the old Kemlyn Road stand was replaced by a cantilevered stand, built {{at a cost of}} £350,000, accommodating 6,700 spectators. Two years later alterations were made at the Anfield Road end, turning it into a larger covered standing area with refreshments under the structure. The biggest redevelopment came in 1973, when the old Main Stand was partially demolished and extended backwards with new roof. Simultaneously the concrete pylon floodlights were demolished with new lights installed along the rooflines of the Kemlyn Road and Main Stands. The new stand was officially opened by the Duke of Kent on 10 March 1973. In the 1980s the paddock in front of the Main Stand was turned into seating, and in 1982 seats were introduced at the Anfield Road end. The Shankly Gates were erected in 1982, a tribute to former manager Bill Shankly; his widow Nessie unlocked {{them for the first time}} on 26 August 1982. Across the Shankly Gates are the words You'll Never Walk Alone, the title of the hit song by Gerry and the <b>Pacemakers</b> adopted by Liverpool fans as the club's anthem during Shankly's time as manager.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Robertson-Cole {{underwent}} a major reorganization as the company's founders departed, though the corporation remained under majority British ownership. The flagship U.S. distribution business {{changed its name}} to Film Booking Offices of America, a banner under which R-C had released more than a dozen independent productions. The West Coast studio apparently continued to make films under the Robertson-Cole name for some time, but FBO ultimately became the primary identity of the business for production as well as distribution. Between the 1922 reorganization and October 1923, one of the company's new American investors, Pat Powers, was effectively in command. Powers had previously led his own filmmaking company, part of the multiple merger that created the large Universal studio in 1912. Powers apparently changed the name of Robertson-Cole/FBO to the Powers Studio for a brief period, though there is no record of the company ever having produced or released a film under that banner. In 1923, the studio launched a series of boxing-themed shorts, Fighting Blood, starring George O'Hara. He would become an FBO mainstay, often paired with Alberta Vaughn, in such comedy series as The <b>Pacemakers</b> (1925). Most of O'Hara's and Vaughn's films for the studio were two-reelers—a measure of film length indicating a running time of about twenty minutes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pacemaker</b> {{syndrome}} {{was first}} described in 1969 by Mitsui et al. {{as a collection}} of symptoms associated with right ventricular pacing. The name <b>pacemaker</b> syndrome was first coined by Erbel in 1979. Since its first discovery, there have been many definitions of <b>pacemaker</b> syndrome, and the understanding of the cause of <b>pacemaker</b> syndrome is still under investigation. In a general sense, <b>pacemaker</b> syndrome can be defined as the symptoms associated with right ventricular pacing relieved with the return of A-V and V-V synchrony.|$|R
40|$|Chest wall {{electrical}} stimuli, {{too weak}} to affect the heart, act as electrical signals to an implanted ventricular-inhibited (QRS blocking) demand <b>pacemaker</b> which interprets them as originating from the heart and consequently responds according to its specifications. Rapid external stimulation permits diagnostic interpretation of the spontaneous electrocardiogram by completely inactivating the implanted <b>pacemaker.</b> The slow random delivery of external stimuli throughout the cardiac cycle delineates the <b>pacemaker</b> refractory period after the emission of a pacing stimulus and after the sensing of a spontaneous beat. During apparent fixed-rate pacing the demand capability of the <b>pacemaker</b> may be easily seen by appropriately timed chest wall stimulation which induces the <b>pacemaker</b> to sense a spontaneous QRS complex.

Chas Newby joined the group, as did Ken Brown, but only after he had left The Quarrymen. The reason for Brown's exit from the group was that he turned up on the seventh Saturday night of The Quarrymen residency at The Casbah with the flu, so Mona ordered him upstairs to the Best's living room to rest. This caused a massive quarrel {{with the rest of the}} group when Mona came to pay them, as they wanted Brown's money to be shared amongst the three of them, as Brown had not played. Mona refused, so The Quarrymen angrily cancelled their residency and stormed out. Colin Manley from The Remo Four was also given a booking to play in the club, which was the only venue that young amateur bands could play at the time. Other groups like The Searchers and Gerry & The <b>Pacemakers</b> later played in the club.

25|$|Many advancements {{have been}} made to improve the control of the {{pacemaker}} once implanted.
