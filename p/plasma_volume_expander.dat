Crystalloids distribute primarily in the extracellular space and following equilibration only 20 – 25 % is thought to remain in the circulation [3]. Data supporting this distribution is mainly based on experiments performed in models of an acute hemorrhage and on postoperative patients using only one volume (dose) of crystalloid [4 – 7].

In addition, permeability effects are analysed in skeletal muscle following endotoxin infusion, as well as effects of <b>plasma</b> <b>volume</b> substitution on intestinal perfusion and metabolism in endotoxaemia. The autoperfused right hind limb skeletal muscle was enclosed in a plethysmograph allowing continuous measurements of tissue volume variations. Capillary filtration coefficient measurements showed that fluid permeability is decreased by albumin and dextran, unchanged by hydroxyethyl starch (HES), and increased by gelatin. Measurements {{of change in the}} reflection coefficient for albumin showed no direct effect on albumin permeability of dextran, gelatin, or hydroxyethyl starch. Hypertonic saline increased fluid permeability an effect not seen with mannitol and urea.

30|$|In hemorrhagic shock, Ringers acetate was a {{more potent}} <b>plasma</b> <b>volume</b> <b>expander</b> than in sepsis. Moreover, no {{decrease}} in efficacy during the first hour after resuscitation could be detected. The observation that normovolemia was not restored even at the highest dose of Ringers acetate, align with our previous finding that normovolemia was not achieved even at a dose of 135  ml/kg at 2  h after a hemorrhage of the same magnitude [18]. This contrasts to less severe hemorrhage, in which immediate resuscitation with crystalloids at a dose of about 4.5 the bleed volume restores normovolemia [14, 28]. Taken together our results suggest that normovolemia {{is very difficult to}} achieve using Ringers acetate in these two models of inflammation. As mentioned above, in clinical practice patients with sepsis may receive large amounts of crystalloids to correct hemodynamics. While we acknowledge that unresponsiveness to fluid resuscitation in sepsis is likely to be multifactorial our results indicate that poor plasma volume expansion by crystalloids is a potential contributing factor.|$|E

30|$|The dosing of RA {{based on}} a {{previous}} study by us and others was intended {{to result in a}} similar <b>plasma</b> <b>volume</b> expansion as in the two colloid groups so that potential effects of the colloid infusions on the glycocalyx would not be confounded by differences in <b>plasma</b> <b>volume</b> [15, 19]. The result that <b>plasma</b> <b>volume</b> in the RA group was lower than in the colloid groups was therefore unexpected. Because the endothelium of all tissues, except the CNS, is freely permeable to electrolytes, crystalloids are commonly thought to distribute rapidly in the whole extravascular volume. Hence, the volume of crystalloid remaining intravascular immediately after resuscitation should reflect the ratio of the extravascular to intravascular distribution volumes. This means that an increased extravascular distribution volume of crystalloids secondary to a shock-induced SIRS response could explain the low efficacy of crystalloids as <b>plasma</b> <b>volume</b> <b>expanders</b> and such a change in the interstitium has been hypothesized to be an important contributor to inflammation-induced oedema formation [20]. Support for this mechanism in inflammatory conditions may be found in a recent publication from our group in which we found that at 15  min after resuscitation in severe sepsis, only about 8  % of the infused volume of crystalloids remained intravascular [21].|$|R

30|$|The {{question}} {{may be asked}} how the lower efficacy of Ringers acetate as a <b>plasma</b> <b>volume</b> <b>expander</b> in sepsis than in hemorrhage may be explained? The vascular endothelium of all tissues except the brain is freely permeable to electrolytes already during normal conditions it is therefore highly unlikely that an inflammation induced increase in endothelial permeability for electrolytes could directly influence efficacy of crystalloids as plasma volume expanders per-se. However, hypovolemia in sepsis is secondary to redistribution of fluid from the intra- to the extravascular compartment {{in part due to}} increased permeability for colloids. This is in contrast to the hypovolemia in hemorrhage, which will initiate compensatory mechanisms to redistribute fluid in the opposite direction in an attempt to maintain normovolemia. Assuming that a crystalloid initially distributes in the extravascular space, the change in the ratio of intravascular to extravascular extracellular volumes is likely to contribute to the low potency of crystalloids in sepsis. Moreover, inflammation blunts homeostatic mechanisms that contribute to the plasma volume expansion observed in non-inflammatory conditions and by this mechanism contribute to the lower potency. Also inflammation-induced changes {{in the structure of the}} interstitial matrix may contribute to the low potency and duration of effect of crystalloids in severe systemic inflammation [31].|$|E

We also studied the effect of low vs high MW HES (MW 200 vs 600 kDa) and rFVIIa on in vivo bleeding time (BT) in rabbits. Results. Haemodilution progressively altered TEG parameters. rFVIIa improved TEG parameters in the presence of acidosis, hypothermia or 20 % haemodilution (P, 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract: We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} repeated intravenous administration of dextrans (DEXs) to rats. Seven-week-old Sprague Dawley rats (6 males/group) were given intravenously 10 % saline solutions of dextrans (DEXs), 40 kDa or 200 – 300 kDa, at a dose level of 5 mL/kg/day for 28 days and they were examined histopathologically. Another group (3 males/group) was administered saline {{in a similar manner}} and served as the control. Histopathological changes indicating accumulation of DEXs in the mononuclear phago-cyte system (MPS) and the liver were noted in the treated groups. The incidence and severity of the findings were molecular weight-dependent, except for the lungs. These results are considered useful in interpreting data from preclinical studies, in which DEXs or their derivatives are administered as test or control substances. (DOI: 10. 1293 /tox. 2013 – 0067; J Toxicol Pathol 2014; 27 : 231 – 234) Key words: macromolecular substances, intravenous administration, mononuclear phagocyte system Dextrans (DEXs) are glucose polymers, that is, kinds of polysaccharides produced by bacteria from sucrose or by chemical synthesis. They have been used clinically as <b>plasma</b> <b>volume</b> <b>expanders</b> for more than five decades 1 be-cause of their high biocompatibility and lack of bioactivity (like heparins). Recently, DEXs and their derivatives have been investigated as potential macromolecular carriers fo...|$|R
40|$|Forty one preterm infants (birth weight < 1500 g) {{were studied}} by daily Doppler {{echocardiography}} {{for the first}} week of life to examine the effect of a haemodynamically significant ductus arteriosus (HSDA) on systemic blood pressure. Hourly records of blood pressure were averaged for each infant to produce a 24 hour mean value and the infants were then allocated to groups according to whether, by echocardiographic criteria, there was a HSDA on that day. In infants from 1000 to 1500 g the differences in all parameters of blood pressure between those with and without a HSDA were not significant. In infants < 1000 g the mean blood pressure was significantly less in the infants with a HSDA throughout the first week of life. Systolic blood pressure was reduced by as much as diastolic blood pressure and as a result the pulse pressure did not differ. Infants < 1000 g with a HSDA were given more plasma and a greater number received inotropic support. Gestational age, respiratory disease severity, and complication rates did not differ between those with and without a HSDA. The possibility of a clinically silent HSDA should be considered before large amounts of <b>plasma</b> <b>volume</b> <b>expanders</b> are given to treat hypotension in infants < 1000 g...|$|R
40|$|Microvascular {{permeability}} {{is important}} for exchange of fluids and proteins in health and in disease. Permeability increases in critical illness, such as during sepsis/SIRS and after trauma, and may be affected by drugs. Increased permeability causes oedema and hypovolaemia. Hypovolaemia is treated with fluids, and their efficacy is determined by their intravascular retention, also influenced by the prevailing permeability. Permeability changes {{in some of these}} situations are evaluated in the present thesis. The effects of endogenous NO and prostacyclin on microvascular permeability were analysed, and we found that they reduce fluid and protein permeability, and conclude that dynamic release of NO and prostacyclin may exert bi-directional regulation of permeability. We also found that exercise decreased fluid permeability in skeletal muscle by release of NO, reducing the exercise-induced oedema. Neither NO nor prostacyclin are responsible for exercise hyperaemia. We found that the anti-hypertensive vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat, combining ACE- and NEP-inhibition, increases fluid and protein permeability through increased bradykinin in plasma due to NEP inhibition, a mechanism that may explain the angiooedema sometimes seen with omapatrilat treatment. After haemorrhage on rat with a relatively normal permeability, 5 % albumin, 4 % gelatin and 6 % hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130 / 0. 4, saline and retransfusion of erythrocytes all had satisfactory <b>plasma</b> <b>volume</b> expanding effects, but albumin was superior the other solutions. After trauma on cat, where permeability was increased, 6 % dextran 70 most likely preserved <b>plasma</b> <b>volume</b> better than 5 % albumin, which was better than 3. 5 % gelatin, 6 % HES 130 / 0. 4 and saline. These results indicate that the efficacy of colloids as <b>plasma</b> <b>volume</b> <b>expanders</b> is determined by the prevailing microvascular permeability...|$|R
