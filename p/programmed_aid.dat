40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between mental illness identity, shame, secrecy, public stigma, and disclosure amongst college students. Participants included 1393 college students from five postsecondary institutions. Methods: Structural equation modeling was used to examine two path models predicting disclosure and desire to join a <b>program</b> <b>aiding</b> with disclosure. Results: Variables found to be significant in predicting disclosure included mental illness identity and public stigma. In turn, desire for disclosure predicted desire to join a <b>program</b> <b>aiding</b> in disclosure. Gender and race/ethnic differences were observed, with men and Whites more likely to want to disclose a mental illness or join a <b>program</b> <b>aiding</b> with disclosure compared with women and non-Whites, respectively. Conclusions: These findings suggest that some college students may find <b>programs</b> <b>aiding</b> in disclosure useful in assisting them to achieve their desire to be “out” with their mental illness...|$|R
