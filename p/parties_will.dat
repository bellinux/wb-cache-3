25|$|The MP {{introducing}} {{the bill will}} generally make a recommendation that the bill be considered by an appropriate Select Committee (see below). Sometimes, it will be recommended that a special Committee be formed, usually when the bill is particularly important or controversial. The House then votes {{as to whether the}} bill should be sent to the Committee for deliberation. It is not uncommon for a bill to be voted to the Select Committee stage even by parties which do not support it — since Select Committees can recommend amendments to bills, <b>parties</b> <b>will</b> often not make a final decision on whether to back a bill until the Second Reading.|$|E
25|$|The Second Reading, {{like the}} first, {{generally}} {{consists of a}} two-hour debate in which MPs make ten-minute speeches. Again, speaking slots are allocated to parties based on their size. In theory, speeches should relate to the principles and objects of the bill, and also to the consideration and recommendations of the Select Committee and issues raised in public submissions. <b>Parties</b> <b>will</b> usually have made their final decision on a bill after the Select Committee stage, and will make their views clear during the Second Reading debates. At {{the conclusion of the}} Second Reading debate, the House votes on whether to accept any amendments recommended by the Select Committee by majority (unanimous amendments are not subjected to this extra hurdle).|$|E

Victims who decide to sue Madoff or third parties, believing they might have the possibility of some recovery, may still deduct 75 percent of their investment. The deduction will {{not be subject to}} the limitations on deduction of itemized deductions. Any loss exceeding current income may result in a net operating loss, which can be carried back, at the taxpayer's election, 3, 4, or 5 years, with any loss still remaining carrying forward 20 years.
