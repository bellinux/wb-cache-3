50|$|In the other, the {{variations}} are simulated by allowing random changes to geometry, constrained by expected distributions within allowed tolerances with the resulting parts assembled, and then measurements of critical places are recorded {{as if in}} an actual manufacturing environment. The collected data is analyzed to find a fit with a known distribution and mean and standard deviations derived from them. The immediate value to this method is that the output represents what is acceptable, even when that is from imperfect geometry and, because it uses recorded data to perform its analysis, {{it is possible to}} include actual factory inspection data into the analysis to see the effect of proposed changes on real data. In addition, because the engine for the analysis is performing the variation internally, not based on CAD regeneration, it is possible to link the variation engine output to another program. For example, a rectangular bar may vary in width and thickness; the variation engine could output those numbers to a stress program which passes back <b>peak</b> <b>stress</b> as a result and the dimensional variation be used to determine likely stress variations. The disadvantage is that each run is unique, so there will be variation from analysis to analysis for the output distribution and mean, just like would come from a factory.

50|$|A MIBI scan or sestamibi scan is now {{a common}} method of cardiac imaging. Technetium (99mTc) sestamibi is a {{lipophilic}} cation which, when injected intravenously into a patient, distributes in the myocardium proportionally to the myocardial blood flow. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of the heart is performed using a gamma camera to detect the gamma rays emitted by the technetium-99m as it decays. Two sets of images are acquired. For one set, 99mTc MIBI is injected while the patient is at rest and then the myocardium is imaged. In the second set, the patient is stressed either by exercising on a treadmill or pharmacologically. The drug is injected at <b>peak</b> <b>stress</b> and then imaging is performed. The resulting two sets of images are compared {{with each other to}} distinguish ischemic from infarcted areas of the myocardium. This imaging technique is limited to being correct only 76% of the time. The problem lies in choosing which images to compare to what. Resting images as discussed by Gorlin in the late 1950s are useful only for detecting tissue damage, while stress images provide evidence of coronary artery (ischemia) disease. Consequently, comparing these two images has led to many errors in disease detection and to results which fail to match results seen when the arteries of the heart are looked at using coronary angiography. Recent studies taking 10 years to complete have demonstrated (infra) that comparing stress-stress images can accurately detect ischemia while rest-rest images can accurately differentiate between dead (infarcted) heart (myocardium) tissue and stunned or hibernating myocardium.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The stress {{distribution}} in braided composites is complex even for simple uniaxial loading. The interlacing of the tows creates a complex load path {{that results in}} full three-dimensional (3 D) {{stress distribution}}. The location and magnitude of <b>peak</b> <b>stresses</b> depend on the particular stress component and vary with various braid architecture parameters such as braid angle and degree of waviness. Finite element analyzes for different braids were performed and it was seen that the <b>peak</b> <b>stresses</b> in the tow mainly occur at the undulating region and {{along the edges of}} the tow. Stress distribution in braids was compared with those in ‘equivalent laminates’. A considerable volume of the tow (10 – 45 % for the considered range of parameters) had stresses larger than an ‘equivalent lamina’. The severity of stresses in a braid as compared to those in an equivalent lamina depends upon braid geometric parameters. Braid angle changes the stress distribution in the tow considerably. However, most of that effect is due to the orientation of the tows in the þ and directions and can be eliminated by matching the loading on the tow of different braids. The severity of <b>peak</b> <b>stresses</b> seems to be increasing linearly with an increase in waviness ratio. KEY WORDS: textile composites, stress analysis, braids, finite element modeling...|$|R

After the ratcheting strain is saturated under the condition that stress amplitude is half of <b>peak</b> <b>stress,</b> it will bring about subsequent fatigue failure, and relationship between fatigue life and one of <b>peak</b> <b>stress</b> and saturated ratcheting (SR) strain meets power law. As the alloy is under stress jiggling with stress amplitude that is 1 %– 2. 5 % of <b>peak</b> <b>stress,</b> the ratcheting strain still become remarkable and goes into shakedown after several hundreds of thousand cycles but there exists little accessional strain caused by creep effect.

40|$|Rupture of the cap of a {{vulnerable}} plaque {{present in a}} coronary vessel may cause myocardial infarction and death. Cap rupture occurs when the <b>peak</b> cap <b>stress</b> exceeds the cap strength. The mechanical stress within a cap depends on the plaque morphology and the material characteristics of the plaque components. A parametric {{study was conducted to}} assess the effect of intima stiffness and plaque morphology on <b>peak</b> cap <b>stress.</b> Methods Models with idealized geometries based on histology images of human coronary arteries were generated by varying geometric plaque features. The constructed multi-layer models contained adventitia, media, intima, and necrotic core sections. For adventitia and media layers, anisotropic hyperelastic material models were used. For necrotic core and intima sections, isotropic hyperelastic material models were employed. Three different intima stiffness values were used to cover the wide range reported in literature. According to the intima stiffness, the models were classified as stiff, intermediate and soft intima models. Finite element method was used to compute <b>peak</b> cap <b>stress.</b> Results The intima stiffness was an essential determinant of cap <b>stresses.</b> The computed <b>peak</b> cap <b>stresses</b> for the soft intima models were much lower than for stiff and intermediate intima models. Intima stiffness also affected the influence of morphological parameters on cap stresses. For the stiff and intermediate intima models, the cap thickness and necrotic core thickness were the most important determinants of cap <b>stresses.</b> The <b>peak</b> cap <b>stress</b> increased three-fold when the cap thickness was reduced from 0. 25 mm to 0. 05 mm for both stiff and intermediate intima models. Doubling the thickness of the necrotic core elevated the <b>peak</b> cap <b>stress</b> by 60 % for the stiff intima models and by 90 % for the intermediate intima models. Two-fold increase in the intima thickness behind the necrotic core reduced the <b>peak</b> cap <b>stress</b> by approximately 25 % for both intima models. For the soft intima models, cap thickness was less critical and changed the <b>peak</b> cap <b>stress</b> by 55 %. However, the necrotic core thickness was more influential and changed the <b>peak</b> cap <b>stress</b> by 100 %. The necrotic core angle emerged as a critical determinant of cap stresses where a larger angle lowered the cap stresses.

The {{effect of}} {{recessing}} on the stresses distributed along the mid-bondline in both standard single lap joints and co-axial ones {{were analyzed using}} elasto-plastic finite element method (FEM). The results obtained show that {{the values of the}} <b>peak</b> <b>stresses</b> of all the stresses distributed in the mid-bondline were changed greatly as the preformed angle in over lap zone was about 10 0 when the high elastic modulus adhesive is used. The effect of the elastic modulus level on the stress distribution (especially the <b>peak</b> <b>stresses)</b> is small in the middle part of the lap zone. When taken the stress distributed in the middle part of the lap zone into account, there is nearly {{no significant difference between the}} peel stress distributed in the standard joint and co-axial single lap joint when the adhesives with lower elastic modulus was used. It is recommended that a co-axial joint is suitable for the recessing joint made by aluminum alloy and a higher elastic modulus adhesive...|$|R
