EDXRF and LIBS calibration models were built with analytes mass fractions determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry after microwave-assisted acid digestion {{in a set of}} 25 wheat flour laboratory samples. Test samples consisted of pressed pellets prepared from wheat flour mixed with 30 % mm- 1 cellulose binder. Experiments were carried out with a LIBS setup consisted of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser and a spectrometer with Echelle optics and ICCD, and a benchtop EDXRF system fitted with a Rh target X-ray tube and a Si(Li) semiconductor detector. the correlation coefficients from the linear calibration models of P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Mn and Zn determined by LIBS and/or EDXRF varied from 0. 9705 for Zn to 0. 9990 for Mg by LIBS, and from 0. 9306 for S to 0. 9974 for K by EDXRF. the coefficients of variation of measurements varied from 1. 2 to 20 % for LIBS, and from 03 to 24 % for EDXRF. the predictive capabilities based on RMSEP (root mean square error of prediction) values were appropriate for the determination of P, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and Zn by LIBS, and for P, K, S, Ca, Fe, and Zn by EDXRF. in general, results from the analysis of NIST SRM 1567 a Wheat flour by LIBS and EDXRF were in agreement with their certified mass fractions.

Ultrasonic vibration-assisted (UV-A) pelleting can produce biomass pellets whose density is comparable to that processed by traditional pelleting methods (e. g. extruding, briquetting, and rolling). This study applied response surface methodology to the development of a predictive model for the energy consumption in UV-A <b>pelleting</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> straw. Effects <b>of</b> <b>pelleting</b> pressure, ultrasonic power, sieve size, and pellet weight were investigated.

40|$|In {{the first}} section of this thesis the {{literature}} relating to the uses of protected proteins fed to ruminants is reviewed. The second section describes an investigation into the effect of formaldehyde treatment of concentrate diets for lambs. The diets consisted essentially <b>of</b> <b>wheat</b> alone and wheat plus 10 % linseed meal or 10 % rapeseed meal, containing 11. 2, 13. 7 and 13. 8 % crude protein respectively. These were fed to 20 kg Corriedale lambs under feedlot conditions. The growth rates of the lambs fed the treated diets were higher than those fed the untreated diets in all cases, but the differences were not statistically significant. Feed intakes were highest with the diets containing linseed meal (P< 0. 0 5). The wool growth rates of lambs fed the treated diets were higher than those fed the untreated diets, but the difference was significant only in the case <b>of</b> the <b>wheat</b> diet (PC 0. 05). Increasing the level of the protein meals in the diets to 20; (about 15. 8 % CP) resulted in increased rates of weight gain with the untreated diets but decreased weight gains and feed intakes {{in the case of the}} treated diets. At the higher protein level the feed intakes and growth rates of lambs fed the untreated linseed meal diet were greater (P< 0. 05) than those of the lambs on the treated linseed meal diet. No other differences between treated and untreated diets were significant. Investigation into methods of applying formalin to hammermilled wheat showed that neither the dilution of the applied formalin nor the air temperature at the time of application had any marked effect on the amount of formaldehyde bound. The use of unsealed containers for storage <b>of</b> the <b>wheat</b> immediately after treatment caused a reduction in the amount <b>of</b> formaldehyde bound. <b>Pelleting</b> <b>of</b> treated <b>wheat</b> stored for two weeks in sealed plastic bags did not result in losses of bound formaldehyde, but considerable losses occurred when the pelleted material was subsequently stored in hessian bags for a further ten weeks.

In order {{to investigate the}} influence of contact time, adsorbent mass and pellet size on the adsorption efficiency the batch mode was carried out. Faster uptake of copper ion was obtained with the fired clay <b>pellets</b> <b>of</b> 5 mm diameter size within 30 minutes. The <b>pellets</b> <b>of</b> 8 mm diameter size showed the higher equilibrium time (60 to 75 minutes) for copper and zinc ion.

The feed pellets were prepared (3 - 5 mm length, 3 mm diameter) by adding 40 ml water for 100 g dry powdered feed mix followed by steaming, pelleting in hand pelletizer and drying at 70 o C. The aqua-stability <b>of</b> feed <b>pellets</b> was determined by measuring the loss in weight <b>of</b> <b>pellets</b> soaked in water and the turbidity of water as Nephlometer reading (NMR). Among the starch sources tested, maida flour in combination with 2 % guar gum in the feed imparted better aqua-stability to pellets followed by tapioca flour, rice flour, wheat flour and corn flour. Further {{increase in the level}} of guar gum in feed had no beneficial effect. It was observed that pellets containing guar gum rapidly swelled and developed cracks and these effects were higher with increase in guar gum level. Feed pellets containing wheat flour and tapioca flour showed highest Nephlometer reading (water turbidity), while pellets with maida flour showed the least NMR followed by corn flour and rice flour.
