30|$|<b>Power</b> <b>to</b> gas (P 2 G) {{technology}} can be classified into <b>power</b> <b>to</b> hydrogen and <b>power</b> <b>to</b> natural gas (methane, CH 4) [26]. Methane has 3 times the volumetric energy density of hydrogen {{and it can be}} directly injected into the existing natural gas pipelines or storage devices for transmission and storage, without any extra cost, so the prospects for application of <b>power</b> <b>to</b> natural gas is presently stronger than for <b>power</b> <b>to</b> hydrogen [27, 28]. Considering this, this paper studies the application of <b>power</b> <b>to</b> natural gas technology in IPGNs. When P 2 G is mentioned below it should be taken <b>to</b> mean <b>power</b> <b>to</b> natural gas, unless stated otherwise.|$|R

40|$|Power-to-gas is a {{promising}} option for storing interment renewables, nuclear baseload power, and distributed energy {{and it is}} a novel concept for the transition to increased renewable content of current fuels with an ultimate goal of transition to a sustainable low-carbon future energy system that interconnects power, transportation sectors and thermal energy demand all together. The aim {{of this paper is to}} introduce different Power-to-gas “pathways”, including <b>Power</b> <b>to</b> Hydrogen, <b>Power</b> <b>to</b> Natural Gas End-users, <b>Power</b> <b>to</b> Renewable Content in Petroleum Fuel, <b>Power</b> <b>to</b> <b>Power,</b> Seasonal Energy Storage <b>to</b> Electricity, <b>Power</b> <b>to</b> Zero Emission Transportation, <b>Power</b> <b>to</b> Seasonal Storage for Transportation, <b>Power</b> <b>to</b> Micro grid, <b>Power</b> <b>to</b> Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) to Pipeline (“Methanation”), and <b>Power</b> <b>to</b> Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) to Seasonal Storage. In order to compare the different pathways, the review of key technologies of Power-to-gas systems are studied and the qualitative efficiency and benefits of each pathway is investigated from the technical points of view. Moreover, different Power-to-gas pathways are discussed as an energy policy option that can be implemented to transition towards a lower carbon economy for Ontario’s energy systems...|$|R

5|$|A {{changing}} legal imperative (transatlantic {{slave trade}} outlawed by Britain in 1807) and economic imperative (a desire {{for political and}} social stability) led most European <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> support widespread cultivation of agricultural products, such as the palm, for use in European industry.|$|E
5|$|A further Bill in 1740 sought <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> {{improve the}} river from Barnby Dun to Fishlake Ferry. Despite serious opposition, which {{included}} the merchants and traders of Doncaster as well as Doncaster Corporation, the Bill was passed, giving the company new <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> make the river deeper and create a cut to avoid the shallows at Stainforth and Bramwith. Work on this northern section started almost immediately. The southern section to Tinsley was navigable by 1751, although the wharf and warehouse had not been completed by that date, and the towpath from Rotherham was not completed until 1822.|$|E
5|$|An Act of Parliament dated 10 June 1825 {{created the}} New Harbour Company, with <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> build the harbour at Tywyn Bach, on the sands near Pembrey.

The community of Burry Port did not exist in 1825, and it was not until 1835 that the name of the company was changed to the Burry Port Company by another Act of Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Both Acts were {{unusual in}} that they gave the bodies <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> borrow money, but did not create the {{companies}} to do the work. Nor were the financial arrangements clearly laid down, and both groups resorted to issuing shares to fund the improvements, although they were not actually empowered to do so. In October 1730, the two groups decided to amalgamate, but a 1731 Act to formalise the agreement and legalise the issuing of shares was defeated because it also included <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> make further changes to the river, including the section below Barnby Dun. Finally an Act of 1733 created The Company of the Proprietors of the Navigation of the River Don, with <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> create a new cut from Bromley Sands above Rotherham to Ickles Dam. The problems presented by the river below Wilsick House, including shallows and fords at Bramwith and Stainforth, and bridges on the Dutch River that were difficult to navigate, resulted in the proprietors trying again to obtain <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> improve the lower river in 1737, but again the petition was defeated in a parliamentary committee. Work continued, {{and it appears that}} Aldwarke was the head of navigation for some years, but Rotherham was reached in 1740.|$|E
5|$|For the 1903 {{parliamentary}} session, the UERL announced {{bills for}} the BS and its other tube railways, seeking permission to merge the three companies by transferring the BS's and CCE's <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP). The BS bill also included requests {{for a further}} extension of time and for <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> compulsorily purchase land for an electrical sub-station at Lambeth. The merger was rejected by Parliament, but the land purchase and extension of time were permitted separately in the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1903 and the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (Extension of Time) Act, 1903, both given royal assent on 11 August 1903.|$|E
