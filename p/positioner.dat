40|$|Since about 1994 several {{manufacturers}} have been introducing {{a new generation}} of valve <b>positioners.</b> They are called digital <b>positioners</b> because they have integrated micro controllers (some manufacturers also call them "intelligent" <b>positioners).</b> They offer a range of features that could be of special interest for LHC: simple installation (Fieldbus reduces cabling and therefore costs) automatic start-up and calibration (self-adaptation to valve) means fast and therefore cheap maintenance communication capability (e. g. Hart, Profibus, etc.) remote configuration preventive maintenance planning using diagnostic data reduced air consumption. The use of this new generation of <b>positioners</b> could improve the overall reliability of the LHC cryogenic system as well as provide significant manpower savings. An analysis of the present and future cryogenic systems shows that the total number of control valves and their widespread distribution in the tunnel (and therefore the length of the access routes) will all be significantly different for LHC than they are for LEP. In LEP, all control valves are close to the access points. In LHC, the control valves will be distributed evenly along the whole tunnel. LHC will make use of about an order of magnitude more control valves in the tunnel than LEP...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the design of two-axis displacement-amplifying {{compliant}} mechanisms (DaCMs) using topology optimization. The two-axis compliant mechanisms considered here are XY <b>positioners</b> and two-axis inertial sensors. A building block approach, with several single-axis DaCMs as building blocks, is used to conceive designs of compliant platforms that provide two orthogonal and independent movement of a common platform. Spring-mass-lever (SML) models of these designs are developed to simplify the analysis and design of the complicated arrangements of building blocks. The XY <b>positioners</b> designed in this work have perfectly de-coupled motion without compromising on the frequency; the best design of the stage has a displacement amplification of five resulting in the enhanced range of 4. 2 % of the mechanism size–a significant improvement from the 1. 67 %, the maximum range of the designs reported so far. Nearly 100 % improvement is observed in {{the sensitivity of the}} two-axis accelerometer as compared with an existing design that occupied the same area. Multiple prototypes of XY <b>positioners</b> were fabricated on polypropylene sheets using CNC machining; and on spring steel and aluminium using wire-cut electro discharge machining. Mask layouts for two-layer two-axis accelerometers are designed for micro-fabrication using reactive ion etching and wafer bonding...|$|R

In particular, the Y-stage has extended travel range of 5 mm ???? 5 mm. They can carry a payload of as much as 0. 3 kg and retain the regulated position under abruptly and continuously varying load conditions. This research comprised analytical design and development, followed by experimental verification and validation. Preliminary analysis and testing included open-loop stabilization and rigorous set-point change and load-change testing to demonstrate the precision-positioning and load-carrying capabilities of the maglev <b>positioners.</b> Decentralized single-input-single-output (SISO) proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control was designed for this analysis. The effect of actuator nonlinearities were reduced through actuator characterization and nonlinear feedback linearization to allow consistent performance over the large travel range. Closed-loop system identification and order-reduction algorithm were developed in order to analyze and model the plant behavior accurately, and to reduce the effect of unmodeled plant dynamics and inaccuracies in the assembly. Coupling among the axes and subsequent undesired motions and crosstalk of disturbances was reduced by employing multivariable optimal linear-quadratic regulator (LQR). Finally, application-specific nanoscale path planning strategies and multiscale control were devised to meet the specified conflicting time-domain performance specifications. All the developed methodologies and algorithms were implemented, individually as well as collectively, for experimental verification. Some of these applications included nanoscale lithography, patterning, fabrication, manipulation, and scanning. With the developed control strategies and motion planning techniques, the two maglev <b>positioners</b> are ready to be used for the targeted applications...|$|R

Energy consumption of the control systems is part of the operating cost of a process plant. However, attempting to minimise energy consumption by restricting energy flow to the final control element may compromise the purpose of the control loop.
