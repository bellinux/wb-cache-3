50|$|The British Admiralty used {{diesel-electric}} <b>paddle</b> <b>tugs</b> {{in recent}} times.

This enabled them to turn one paddle ahead and one astern to turn and maneuver quickly.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Method {{of design}} and {{analysis}} of bollard pull harbour tug focuses in its stability and straight movement. Research includes {{a brief review of}} general description of bollard pull harbour <b>tug,</b> <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> functions, <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> characteristics, functions, operation modes, requirements for <b>tug</b> <b>boats,</b> stability standard and factor affecting stability, stability requirements, displacement and buoyancy, fundamental {{of design and}} a very last, fundamental of analysis. This research also discuss about the methodology to implement the design and analysis to measure the stability and movement of the <b>tug</b> <b>boat.</b> The purpose of design modelling is to identify the error of the existing design and to redesign to eliminate or reduce errors. The error consists of the hull structure and skeg design. However to redesign the hull and skeg must be done during design stage. For this report, it will discuss only the basis of the design methodology. The analysis of the stability and straight movement of the bollard pull harbour tug are using software analysis. SolidWorks and ANSYS are the proposed analysis software that will implement for this thesis. The analysis of the <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> is study on static and dynamic analysis that discuss about finite element analysis and hydrodynamic analysis. Dynamic analysis is important part because it deals with how the <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> moving in a stable and balanced during its operation...|$|R

25|$|A {{relatively}} minor sideline, {{started in the}} 1890s, was the company's <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> operations.

With the decline of coastal shipping however, towage assumed more importance. By the 1960s, towage and associated operations represented a very significant part of the company's activities.|$|R
2500|$|Final {{preparations}} to refloat {{the ship}} began on 28 June 2007 when the ballast water, added earlier to stabilise the vessel, was pumped out to aid buoyancy.

An ocean swell up to [...] pounded the ship and caused the bow to move back and forth even when tethered to the <b>tug</b> <b>boats.</b> Soon after the attempt started to shift the ship, one of the cables connecting the ship to the <b>tug</b> <b>boat</b> Keera snapped dashing the attempt.
