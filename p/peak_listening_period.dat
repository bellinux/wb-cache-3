50|$|In {{the days}} before {{television}}, <b>peak</b> <b>listening</b> time was around 8pm, but with television arriving {{in the country in}} the late 1950s, the station had to change formats to survive the new medium. This was even more the case when 2KO's owners at the time, United Broadcasting Company (Australia) (who also owned Sydney's 2UE), itself owned by the local Lamb family, was part of the consortium that brought television to Newcastle, launching NBN Television on channel 3 in 1962.|$|R
50|$|All {{stations}} using 2182 kHz {{were required}} to maintain a strictly enforced three-minute silence and <b>listening</b> <b>period</b> twice each hour, starting at h+00, h+30.

As a visual aide-memoire, a typical clock in a ship's radio room would have these silence periods marked by shading the sectors from h+00 to h+03 and from h+30 to h+33 in green.

40|$|Passive {{acoustic}} monitoring is {{an important}} tool in marine mammal studies. However, logistics and finances frequently constrain the number and servicing schedules of acoustic recorders, requiring a trade-off between deployment periods and sampling continuity, i. e., {{the implementation of a}} subsampling scheme. Optimizing such schemes to each project's specific research questions is desirable. This study investigates the impact of subsampling on the accuracy of two common metrics, acoustic presence and call rate, for different vocalization patterns (regimes) of baleen whales: (1) variable vocal activity, (2) vocalizations organized in song bouts, and (3) vocal activity with diel patterns. To this end, above metrics are compared for continuous and subsampled data subject to different sampling strategies, covering duty cycles between 50 % and 2 %. The results show that a reduction of the duty cycle impacts negatively on the accuracy of both acoustic presence and call rate estimates. For a given duty cycle, frequent short <b>listening</b> <b>periods</b> improve accuracy of daily acoustic presence estimates over few long <b>listening</b> <b>periods.</b> Overall, subsampling effects are most pronounced for low and/or temporally clustered vocal activity. These findings illustrate the importance of informed decisions when applying subsampling strategies to passive acoustic recordings or analyses for a given target species...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Reduced energy {{consumption}} {{is a crucial}} aspect of mobile Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) networks, which {{are expected to be}} populated by battery-operated devices, like mobile phones and palmtops. For this reason the IEEE 802. 16 e, {{which is one of the}} front-runner competitors in this field, specifies a set of power saving mechanisms to be employed by the Base Station (BS) and Mobile Stations (MSs) to reduce the amount of time the latter spend with the wireless interface on. These mechanisms are classified into three class types, which are designed for different types of applications. In this paper we focus on class type I, which fits the typical requirements of best-effort traffic. With class type I, an MS with power saving enabled alternates between sleep and <b>listening</b> <b>periods.</b> The duration of the sleep periods increases by a factor 2 each time a <b>listening</b> <b>period</b> ends, up to a maximum sleep window size. Since the standard does not provide guidelines for setting the above parameters, which are negotiated between the BS and MSs when setting up a power saving class, we evaluate via simulation their impact on the performance, in terms of both application-specific metric, i. e. delay or throughput depending on the type of traffic, and the amount of energy saved.

5000|$|Before the MAPL {{system was}} {{established}} in 1971, Canadian music was regarded with indifference by Canadian radio, and during the 1960s, much of Canadian radio was dominated by British and American acts. This was a major hurdle for Canadian musicians since they could not gain attention in their home country without having a hit single in the United States or Europe first. Even after MAPL was implemented in the early 1970s, some radio stations were criticised for ghettoizing their Canadian content to dedicated program blocks, in off-peak listening hours such as early mornings or after midnight, during which the music played would be almost entirely Canadian — thus having the effect of significantly reducing how many Canadian songs would actually have to be played during <b>peak</b> <b>listening</b> times. These program blocks became mockingly known as [...] "beaver hours".

30|$|Like counter-based protocols, distance-based {{broadcast}} protocols[11] use {{the notion}} of expected additional coverage to determine {{the value of a}} node’s retransmission. Instead of counting neighbour retransmissions, they look at the signal strength of these retransmissions to estimate additional coverage. They assume that signal strength (captured from the Received Signal Strength Indicator - RSSI) is an indication of a transmitter’s distance to the receiving node. The greater the distance (i.e. the lower the first message’s RSSI), the more additional nodes the receiving node can cover with its retransmission. To exploit this notion, distance-based protocols wait for a random but bounded time after the first message reception listening to further retransmissions. If the maximum signal strength of all received retransmissions falls below a certain threshold, the node is allowed to retransmit. Both counter-based and distance-based broadcast protocols use random <b>listening</b> <b>periods</b> which can be counter-productive: nodes of higher topological importance may be preempted from retransmitting if the listening timer of less ‘important’ nodes in their vicinity expires first.|$|R

30|$|Conversely, {{a number}} of studies are {{currently}} considering not only energy savings but also the QoS issues as well [13 – 17]. In [13], the authors proposed an energy-saving centric scheme for downlink scheduling. The authors presented a longest virtual burst first (LVBF) scheduling algorithm to improve the energy efficiency of MSs and meet the requirement of minimal data rates for the connection with PSC I [14]. A minimum wakeup time (MWT) scheduling scheme for PSC II was proposed in [15] to determine the maximal sleeping time for a single MS with constant bit rate (CBR) traffic and analyzed the upper bound for multiple MS power-saving scheduling with a MWT. Tsao and Chen [16] proposed two power-saving scheduling algorithms. The first algorithm is a periodic on-off scheme based on the idea of allowing an MS to sleep for a fixed interval and, subsequently, to listen for another fixed interval in a round-robin manner to determine feasible solutions for minimal energy consumption under the delay constraint. The aperiodic on-off scheme was proposed to solve the energy-wasting problem of no traffic transmission during a fixed <b>listen</b> <b>period,</b> which adjusts the length of sleep and <b>listen</b> <b>periods</b> according to the traffic status. The energy-efficient architecture for two-level scheduling was proposed in [17]. The proposed architecture sets a priority order for the first-level scheduling by assuming that a mobile and fixed station coexist in the network and that mobile stations have a higher priority than fixed stations from an energy-saving viewpoint. Their study proposed a two-timer mechanism (i.e., empty timer and overloading timer) to dynamically adjust the state transition timing to achieve optimal energy efficiency. Most previous studies considered either sleeping period management for one type of connection or sleep synchronization of multiple connections, but resource scheduling for uplink traffic from an energy saving viewpoint was seldom considered. However, a BS must serve various types of connections for multiple MSs in a practical environment. Hence, {{the purpose of this study}} is to schedule sleeping and resources in a tradeoff manner so that an MS can conserve as much energy as possible and sufficiently provision its desired QoS.|$|R

40|$|Background: Although {{there is}} a growing body of {{literature}} to support the importance of understanding self processes in the experience of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), no experimental research has directly examined the relationship between self-construals and phenomena central to OCD. The current study examined the effect that unwanted intrusions and neutralizing responses have on self-worth, distress and urge to neutralize. Methods: After listening to repeated audio recordings of idiosyncratic unwanted intrusions, a combined nonclinical and clinical OCD sample were asked to respond with either their chosen neutralizing strategy (experimental) or a refocus counting strategy (control). Each condition comprised of a 12 -min responding period (respond) followed by an equivalent non-response <b>period</b> (<b>listen).</b> Participants completed each condition, and were randomly allocated into the condition completed first. Ratings of discomfort, urge to neutralize, and self-worth were measured throughout. Results: Neutralizing and refocussing responses were both associated with decreases in discomfort and higher self-worth. The expected rebound effect for discomfort and urge to neutralize for the <b>listen</b> <b>period</b> after neutralizing was found. Limitations: Methodological problems lead to missing data, although this was corrected with the use of Multi Level Modelling (MLM) analysis on a combined sample. The small clinical sample meant that comparison between the two populations was not possible. Conclusions: Findings support cognitive accounts that neutralizing is involved in the development and maintenance of OCD, and suggest that neutralizing is a purposeful response aimed to help reinstate selfworth.

30|$|The MAC schemes in the {{literature}} that are targeting VANETs {{can be divided into}} two classes: CSMA-based and TDMA-based. The CSMA-based protocols considered, for example, in [5, 6] are enhanced by providing different priority levels allowing packets with higher priorities to have shorter <b>listening</b> <b>period</b> before a channel access attempt is made. However, the channel may still be busy and when it is, a transmitter with higher priority traffic will randomize a shorter backoff time than transmitters with lower priority traffic. This type of prioritization mechanism where the delay before channel access together with the backoff time is manipulated according to packet priorities is also found in the standard IEEE 802.11 e which is included in IEEE 802.11 p. In [5], there is also an additional feature where a potential transmitter sends a busy tone using a reserved frequency to get the attention from the intended recipient, which then polls the busy tone sender. However, busy tones and prioritizing packets do not eliminate the problem and there is still no upper bound on when channel access can take place.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Wireless access {{networks}} scale by replicating base stations geographically and then allowing mobile clients to seamlessly “hand off ” from one station {{to the next}} as they traverse the network. However, providing the illusion of continuous connectivity requires selecting {{the right moment to}} handoff and the right base station to transfer to. Unfortunately, 802. 11 -based networks only attempt a handoff when a client’s service degrades to a point where connectivity is threatened. Worse, the overhead of scanning for nearby base stations is routinely over 250 ms – during which incoming packets are dropped – far longer than what can be tolerated by highly interactive applications such as voice telephony. In this paper we describe SyncScan, a low-cost technique for continuously tracking nearby base stations by synchronizing short <b>listening</b> <b>periods</b> at the client with periodic transmissions from each base station. We have implemented this SyncScan algorithm using commodity 802. 11 hardware and we demonstrate that it allows better handoff decisions and over an order of magnitude improvement in handoff delay. Finally, our approach only requires trivial implementation changes, is incrementally deployable and is completely backward compatible with existing 802. 11 standards...|$|R
40|$|We present Trickle, an {{algorithm}} for propagating and main-taining code updates in wireless sensor networks. Trickle uses a “polite gossip ” policy, where nodes periodically broad-cast a code summary {{to local}} neighbors but stay quiet {{if they have}} recently heard a summary identical to theirs. When a node hears an older summary than its own, it broadcasts an update. Instead of flooding a network with packets, the al-gorithm controls the send rate so each node hears a small trickle of packets, just enough to stay up to date. We first analyze Trickle using an idealized single-cell net-work model, with perfect synchronization and no packet loss. Progressively relaxing these assumptions, we evaluate the al-gorithm in simulation, first without synchronization, then {{in the presence of}} loss, and finally in the multi-cell case. We validate these simulation results with empirical data from a real-world deployment. We show that Trickle scales well, with the aggregate network transmission count increasing as a logarithm of cell density. We show that by dynamically ad-justing <b>listening</b> <b>periods,</b> Trickle can rapidly propagate new code, taking on the order of seconds, while keeping mainte-nance costs on the order of a few sends per hour per node. 1...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{efficient}} protocols {{are important}} in ad hoc networks since battery life for wireless devices is limited. The IEEE 802. 11 protocol specifies a simple power save mechanism (PSM) to conserve energy. However, the protocol needlessly wastes energy when traffic is light in a network, and significantly increases packet latency. In this paper, we consider three techniques to improve the 802. 11 PSM protocol. The first technique, Carrier Sense ATIM, uses carrier sensing to drastically reduce the energy wasted listening to the channel in 802. 11 PSM. The second technique, Dynamic ATIM, dynamically extends the <b>listening</b> <b>period</b> in 802. 11 PSM based on packet advertisements that are overheard. In this manner, {{we are able to}} advertise data packets just as effectively as 802. 11 PSM while significantly reducing wasteful listening. The final technique, Per-Link Beacon Intervals, allows sender and receiver pairs to schedule their wake-up times independent from all the other nodes in the network based on past packet arrival times. Our results show that this technique is able to significantly reduce the average packet latency causing no or relatively little increase in energy. All of the protocols are extensively tested using the ns- 2 simulator. 1...|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} MAC {{was designed}} {{with a view}} to providing guaranteed channel access to the high-priority nodes with urgent data delivery needs. This helped us to meet the QoS requirement for vital sign monitoring. As per our survey, the most related MAC protocols to our design are PRIMA [16] and QMAC [17]. Similarities in our design and these include the use of RTS/CTS for channel contention, use of different queues to reflect different levels of latency requirement. Unlike PRIMA, which uses TDMA/CSMA, the proposed MAC used a combination of OFDMA and CSMA in channel access. Nodes in different frequency segments can communicate to the next hop neighbor independently. As routing protocol design is not the aim of the paper, we used a simple RSSI-based forward routing to route data to the sink node via multi-hop. Note that we can extend to using a more complex routing mechanism using clustering and cluster heads as proposed in LEACH [18] and its subsequent improvements in [16, 19]. The proposed design allows those nodes that have no data to go into the sleep state, thus minimizing the idle <b>listening</b> <b>periods</b> that consume significant energy in sensor networks. In this sense, the energy consumption due to sleep cycle and idle listening in our system is the same as PRIMA.|$|R
