40|$|Ten {{species of}} tree borers in 3 {{families}} {{were collected from}} bait logs and dead trees in red pine forests infested by the pine needle gall midge, Thecodiplosis _iaponensis. They are secondary pests and played a minor role in causing tree mortality in the stands studied. Red pine stands with about 14 kQ of cambial electrical resistance on an average in May were very vital; those with over 21 kQ were in high mortality {{as a result of}} attacks by the <b>pine</b> <b>gall</b> midge...|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{studies of}} the {{population}} dynamics of the <b>pine</b> <b>gall</b> midge, Thecodiplosis japonensis, were made in four Korean red pine forests. Survivorship curves developed from these studies indicate that most gall midge mortality occurs in three periods of the larval stage : 1) in newly hatched larvae, prior to gall formation, 2) in young larvae, after the galls have formed, and 3) in mature larvae that have dropped to the soil. At sites where midge populations were decreasing following a period of severe damage, mortality rates were much higher in all developmental stages than at sites with increasing populations. Examples of density-dependent mortality which can combine to suppress populations or stabilize them are : mortality of newly hatched larvae induced by physiological changes of needles resulting from severe midge damage; larval mortality resulting from early gall withering; and mortality caused by Piutygaster mutsutama, a wasp parasite that attacks the midge larvae very early but kills them after they have dropped to the soil...|$|E
40|$|The {{diversity}} of spider communities {{was investigated in}} the pine forest of Pinus densiflora inSongri-san, where chemical pesticides had been applied to control <b>pine</b> <b>gall</b> midge (Thecodiplosis japonensis). Spider communities were surveyed in four areas: a pesticide-untreated natural forest (area A), a forest withvinyl-covered ground surface (area B), an aldicarb-treated forest (area C) and a forest treated with a systemicpesticide (phosphamidon) (area D). A total of 74 spider species from 17 families were collected from the foursurvey areas. There were 54 species from 15 families in area A, 27 species from 12 families in area B, 29 species from 9 families in area C and 34 species from 9 families in area D, respectively. The species diversityof spider communities was highest in pesticide-untreated area A, and much lower in the other three areas. Themonthly species {{diversity of}} spider communities was highest in May and lowest in January. The similarity of thespider communities was highest in areas B and D. The monthly similarity of the spider communities was highestin November and February. The dominant species was Clubiona jucunda (12. 71 %, N= 304 individuals). Accordingto our results, the application of aldicarb and phosphamidon dramatically decreased spider diversity and thenumber of individuals in the forests. Thus, the application of these two pesticides to natural forests should berestricted, or alternative pesticides need to be developed. Our results also indicated that application of thepesticides should be avoided in May and June when high spider diversity is expected...|$|E

40|$|The <b>pine</b> needle <b>gall</b> midge is {{the most}} {{injurious}} pest of Pinus densifora and P. thwzbergii in Korea. In general, <b>pine</b> needle <b>gall</b> midge damage reaches a maximal level about 7 years following invasion by the midge, and parasite populations increase a few years thereafter. Four species of Platygastridae that parasitize the midge {{have been found in}} Korea, and their parasitization percentages are on the increase. Three of the parasites, P. matsutama, I. hockpari, and I. seoulis are effective natural enemies of the midge and have been utilized for biological control by translocation...|$|R
50|$|Pine-pine gall rust has {{characteristically}} brown to yellow-orange sori {{visible on}} large globular <b>galls</b> on <b>pines.</b> <b>Gall</b> formation on trunks occurs over 2-4 {{years and is}} stimulated by the pathogen, which causes cells to grow and divide quickly {{at the site of}} initial infection. When mature, the gall splits open and the yellow-orange aeciospores are dispersed and carried to new hosts by wind. Because P. harknessii does not require an alternate host, the aeciospores can infect another pine directly. This typically occurs during moist conditions and rarely infects older shoots. Infection continues on the host shoots and needles until they have reached 90% of their elongation. Gall mortality is associated with squirrel feeding or invasion and inactivation by secondary organisms. The life cycle of E. Harknessii is different from other pine stem rust in that it is autoecious, making large stands of pines ideal hosts for survival and reproduction of the fungus.|$|R

5000|$|In 1561 {{there was}} a {{significant}} deforestation in the area known as the Montecillo, who had numerous oaks, <b>pines</b> and <b>gall,</b> so thick that it was inhabited by large numbers of wolves. Felling of wood took place agreed upon by neighbors and Villaconejos Colmenar de Oreja. 3 The residents had to carry out raids from time to time because these mammals reached the entrances to villages, threatening the inhabitants [...] The fact that there were wolves, therefore must also had rabbits as food.|$|R

The abundant rainfall {{throughout the year}} favours the colour, vegetation and particular “atmosphere” prevalent in Valdegovía. The region’s vegetation is particularly characterised by pinewoods of albar <b>pine,</b> kermes oak, <b>gall</b> oak and beech. There are also other very typical vegetation types such as scrub, rock plants and vegetation associated with natural springs and still water. The most common mammals {{in the region are}} the roe deer, wild boar, fox and hare.|$|R
40|$|Population {{dynamics}} with {{spatial information}} {{is applied to}} understand the spread of pests. We introduce a model describing how pests spread in discrete space. The number of pest descendants at each site is controlled by local information such as temperature, precipitation, and the density of pine trees. Our simulation leads to a pest spreading pattern comparable to the real data for <b>pine</b> needle <b>gall</b> midge in the past. We also simulate the model in two different climate conditions based on two different representative concentration pathways scenarios for the future. We observe that after an initial stage of a slow spread of pests, a sudden change in the spreading speed occurs, which is soon followed by a large-scale outbreak. We found that a future climate change causes the outbreak point to occur earlier and that the detailed spatio-temporal pattern of the spread depends on the source position from which the initial pest infection starts.

40|$|The {{structural}} dynamics of host–parasitoid populations {{play a key}} role in the mechanism of natural community development with invasive species. Species invading new habitats experience coevolution with their newly acquired natural enemies, and their population dynamics are driven by a complex interaction between biological and environmental factors. We examined the biological and environmental factors which potentially influence a community of parasitoids throughout the 25 -year invasion history of the <b>pine</b> needle <b>gall</b> midge (PNGM), Thecodiplosis japonensis, an important pest of pines in eastern Asia. We found that differences in establishment sequence and competitive ability among the parasitoids attacking this species determined the parasitoid community’s structure and dynamics. In particular, the timing for the initial establishment of the host–parasitoid association, incomplete superiority in competition among parasitoids, and indirect competition by a combination of the parasitoids were important factors for determining community’s structure and dynamics. Finally, the history of change in the community composition could be explained by the phenology differences in its member species, mediated by environmental factors...|$|R
