5|$|The ratings also do {{not reflect}} state-specific {{population}} conditions. For instance, for the Texas horned lizard, much of eastern Texas has lost the animal. Nevertheless, based on healthy populations in other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>West,</b> especially New Mexico, the IUCN rates the animal Least Concern. For the timber rattlesnake (West Virginia), the IUCN notes the animal as losing range {{in many parts of}} the northeastern U.S., but because the animal is numerous in the southern Appalachians, it is also Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|St Beuno's Church is in Aberffraw on the {{south-west}} {{coast of}} Anglesey, north Wales. It is set within a large churchyard in the south-west of the village, {{on the south}} side of Church Street. The first church community was established in Aberffraw in the 7th century by St Beuno (a Welsh holy man who became the abbot of Clynnog Fawr, on the Llŷn Peninsula in Gwynedd). No part of a structure from that period survives; the oldest parts of the present building are the south wall of the nave and some <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> wall, which are from the 12th century.|$|E

5|$|This growing {{coalition}} {{expanded the}} potential enemies that Rome might face, and moved Rome closer to confrontation with major powers. The result was more alliance-seeking, {{on the part}} of both the Roman confederacy and city-states seeking membership (and protection) within that confederacy. While there were exceptions to this (such as military rule of Sicily after the First Punic War), it was not until after the Second Punic War that these alliances started to harden into something more like an empire, at least in certain locations. This shift mainly took place in <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> such as the southern Italian towns that sided with Hannibal.|$|E
5|$|Copano Bay is {{approximately}} twelve-by-six-miles, oriented {{from the southwest}} to the northeast. It is found mainly on undeveloped land, though ranches are located on <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> south and north shores. The main extensions include Mission Bay, which stretches to the north {{to the mouth of}} the Mission River, and Port Bay to the west, which forms the southern boundary of the Live Oak peninsula. The peninsula is located on the eastern shore of Copano Bay and is lined with beach homes and residences, which begin just west of the inlet Salt Lake to the head of Live Oak peninsula at the confluence of Copano and Aransas Bay. This opening is spanned by the Copano Bay Causeway and the Copano Bay Fishing Pier, which once served as the main crossing to the Lamar peninsula. Holiday Beach is found on the northeastern shore of Copano Bay on the Lamar Peninsula. Just north of the community is the mouth of Copano Creek, which marks the bay's northernmost point. From here, the shoreline turns to the southwest past the Copano Bay Oil and Gas Field and four sloughs before reaching the ruins of the ghost town Copano at Copano Point, marked by white cliffs. At the point, the Copano Reef juts out almost halfway across the bay. Further southwest, past the mouth of Mission Bay, Bayside stretches along the coast to the mouth of the Aransas River. The shoreline turns to the southeast from this point, past the Egery Flats and Egery Island through Swan Lake and to the mouth of Port Bay.|$|E

25|$|While many post-Nicene Christians {{asserted}} Arius's {{death as}} miraculous—a consequence of his heretical views—several recent writers mention that Arius may have simply been poisoned by his opponents.

25|$|An early ceasefire {{with the}} rebels, {{which had the}} backing {{of much of the}} {{northern}} populace, proved short-lived, and fighting over the prime cocoa-growing areas resumed. France sent in troops to maintain the cease-fire boundaries, and militias, including warlords and fighters from Liberia and Sierra Leone, took advantage of the crisis to seize <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>west.</b>|$|E
25|$|The battalion’s {{march and}} service {{supported}} the eventual cession {{of much of}} the American Southwest from Mexico to the United States, especially the Gadsden Purchase of 1853 of southern Arizona and New Mexico.

The metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties also became counties for purposes such as lieutenancy.|$|E
25|$|Some {{jellyfish}} {{populations that}} have shown clear {{increases in the}} past few decades are invasive species, newly arrived from other habitats: examples include the Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Baltic Sea, central and eastern Mediterranean, Hawaii, and tropical and subtropical <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Atlantic (including the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and Brazil). Invasive populations can expand rapidly because they often face no predators in the new habitat.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} modern period, an age of {{discovery}} and trade was undertaken by the Western European nations. Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and France went on a colonial expansion and took possession of lands and set up colonies in Africa, southern Asia, and North and South America. Turkey colonized Southeastern Europe, and <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Asia and North Africa. Russia took possession in Eastern Europe, Asia, and North America.|$|E

25|$|Following the June 1967 Six-Day War, Hebron {{came under}} Israeli control.

Israel's position was that <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Bank be traded for peace with Jordan.
