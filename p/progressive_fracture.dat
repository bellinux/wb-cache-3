40|$|<b>Progressive</b> <b>fracture</b> in quasi-brittle {{materials}} is often treated via strain softening models in continuum damage mechanics. Such constitutive relations favour spurious strain localization and ill-posedness of boundary value problems. The introduction of non-local damage models {{together with a}} characteristic length parameter controlling {{the size of the}} fracture process zone is known to regularize the problem. In order to account for the non-locality of these models, it is crucial to work with fine spatial discretizations at the damage progress zone.

50|$|A {{cataclastic}} rock {{is a type}} of {{metamorphic rock}} that has been wholly or partly formed by the <b>progressive</b> <b>fracturing</b> and comminution of existing rock, a process known as cataclasis, and is mainly found associated with fault zones. Mylonite was originally defined as a cataclastic rock but is now understood to have formed mainly by crystal-plastic processes.|$|R
50|$|Cataclasite forms by the <b>progressive</b> <b>{{fracturing}}</b> {{of mineral}} grains and aggregates, {{a process known}} as cataclasis. The fracturing continues until a distribution of clast sizes is developed that allows the sliding of clasts past each other, without high enough frictional stresses to further fracture the rock significantly. From then on deformation is accommodated by continued sliding and rolling of fragments, a deformation mechanism known as cataclastic flow. In poorly consolidated or unconsolidated sediments, deformation in fault zones also occurs by rolling and sliding of grains but the porosity of the rock accommodates the resulting strains without significant grain fracturing.|$|R
40|$|Charcot foot neuropathic osteoarthropathy is a {{disorder}} affecting the soft tissues, joints, and {{bones of the}} foot and ankle. The disease is triggered in a susceptible individual {{through a process of}} uncontrolled inflammation leading to osteolysis, <b>progressive</b> <b>fractures</b> and articular malpositioning due to joint subluxations and dislocations. The progression of the chronic deformity with a collapsed plantar arch leads to plantar ulcerations because of increased pressure on the plantar osseous prominences and decreased plantar sensation. Subsequent deep soft tissue infection and osteomyelitis may result in amputation. The Charcot foot in diabetes represents an important diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in clinical practice. Conservative treatment remains the standard of the care for most patients with neuropathic disorder. Offloading the foot and immobilization based on individual merit are essential and are the most important recommendations in the active acute stage of the Charcot foot.

A modified Split Hopkinson Bar, SHB, test methodology is {{used to determine the}} material properties in tension at high loading rates which are used in numerical models simulating <b>progressive</b> <b>fracturing.</b> The main focus {{of this paper is to}} examine the predictive capability of existing classical and regularised continuum models in reproducing the SHB experiments.

Strain-rate dependency of materials subjected to an impulsive loading is taken into account by including viscous terms in the continuum description. The examples here give an indication of the sensitivity of the model parameters in the computational models and the coupled viscoplastic damage model shows the promising capability of simulating the fracture process of the SHB test. The effect and physical interpretation of the parameters and their mutual dependency in dynamics are not sufficiently understood, and more work is needed to present a physically realistic model for concrete under high loading rates based on micro-mechanics to account for the true mechanisms that cause the strength increase. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{one-dimensional}} imbricate nonlocal continuum, {{developed in}} a previous paper in order to model strain-softening within zones of finite size, is extended here {{to two or three}} dimensions. The continuum represents a lImit of a system of imbricated (overlapping) elements that have a fixed s. ze and a diminishing cross section as the mesh is refined. The proper variational method for the imbricate continuum is developed, and the contmuum equations of mo-tion are derived from the principle of virtual work.

Veins are filled with white calcite in grey host rock, allowing 0. 7 meter-resolution mapping based on satellite image interpretation, followed by ground-truthing with detailed field observation in selected areas. From Quickbird and Landsat data, a model was developed using interpreted 562 faults and 145, 000 fractures {{in an area of}} 31 km 2; the area of a typical 3 -D seismic survey but with one hundred times higher resolution. Four generations of veins, with strikes of 130 °, 000 °, 090 ° and 045 °, are overprinted by normal faults with wide cemented damage zones and offsets up to 500 m. Veins are generally a few 10 s of meters long, and lack signs of strong mechanical interactions such as curving or abutting. This suggests a restoration of the bulk strength during the formation of the joints, and an anticlockwise rotation of permeability anisotropy during <b>progressive</b> <b>fracturing.</b> The spatial density of all cemented fractures is rather homogenous, but the spatial density within individual joint sets is heterogeneous, suggesting patchy fracturing during the different evolutionary stages.

And (ii) to validate the model with realistic test data that represent typical hip fractures. The objective {{of the current study}} was to develop and experimentally validate an accurate 3 D finite element (FE) model coupled to a quasi-brittle damage law to simulate human proximal femur fracture considering the initiation and progressive propagation of multiple cracks phases Under quasi-static load. The model is based on continuum damage mechanics that can predict hip fracture in more adequate physical terms than criteria-based fracture models. In order to validate the model, ten human proximal femurs were tested until complete fracture under one-legged stance quasistatic load. QCT/FE models were generated and FE simulations were performed on these femurs with the same applied loads and boundary conditions than in the stance experiments. The proposed FE model leads to excellent agreement (R 2 = 0. 9432) between predicted and measured results concerning the shape of the force-displacement curve (yielding and fracturing) and the profile of the fractured edge.

Simulation of various composite failure modes, such as delamination and layer cracking, requires a sophisticated numerical approach {{capable of handling}} anisotropic behavior of individual layers as well as potential interaction phenomena. The combined finite/discrete element (FE/DE) methodology {{has proved to be}} an efficient approach for the simulation of <b>progressive</b> <b>fracture</b> in brittle and quasi-brittle media. Therefore, an existing FE/DE approach has been adopted and modified in this study for the simulation of delamination and fracture in composites subjected to impact loadings.

It is followed by details of formulation for composite failure mechanisms, including the Hoffman material model and the 3 D Hashin interface model. Several numerical simulations are then discussed to assess the performance of the proposed approach. Full <b>progressive</b> <b>fracture</b> and fragmentation behavior as well as potential post-cracking interactions caused by the newly created crack sides and segments are automatically controlled.

40|$|The high {{computational}} cost {{involved in}} modeling of the <b>progressive</b> <b>fracture</b> simulations using large discrete lattice networks {{stems from the}} requirement to solve a new large set of linear equations every time a new lattice bond is broken. To address this problem, we propose an algorithm that combines the multiple-rank sparse Cholesky downdating algorithm with the rank-p inverse updating algorithm based on the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula for the simulation of <b>progressive</b> <b>fracture</b> in disordered quasi-brittle materials using discrete lattice networks. Using the present algorithm, the computational complexity of solving the new set of linear equations after breaking a bond reduces to the same order {{as that of a}} simple backsolve (forward elimination and backward substitution) using the already LU factored matrix. That is, the computational cost is O(nnz(L)), where nnz(L) denotes the number of non-zeros of the Cholesky factorization L of the stiffness matrix A. This algorithm using the direct sparse solver is faster than the Fourier accelerated preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) iterative solvers, and eliminates the critical slowing down associated with the iterative solvers that is especially severe close to the critical points. Numerical results using random resistor networks substantiate the efficiency of the present algorithm. Comment: 15 pages including 1 figure. On page pp 11407 of the original paper (J. Phys. A: Math.

40|$|The fault-propagation folds are {{generally}} associated with blind faults {{and they have}} recently been recognized as extremely important for their seismic hazard potential. The Chi-Chi earthquake produced many monoclinal scarps by fault-propagation folding which caused great damage. The trishear kinematic model of fault-propagation folding appears to approximately represent the geometric development of some structures like monoclines, comparatively little is known of the mechanical controls on their development. Thus we construct a series of distinct-element models that consist of bounded assemblies of elastic particles that simulate the brittle deformation associated with fault-related folding over a rigid footwall. Here we attempt to predict the broad-scale features and basic characteristics of distributed deformation developed above blind contractional faults at depth. The initial rock mass is modeled {{by a series of}} discrete, non-uniform-sized circular, elastic, frictional particles, connected with each other by parallel bonds and capable of <b>progressive</b> <b>fracturing</b> during loading. The models reproduce the deformation patterns with an evolutionary slip of rigid the basement fault in different strength of parallel bond representing the cementation of granular particles. We conclude that weak cover strength promotes cover flowage, wide zone of deformation and limited fault propagation while strong cover reproduce a narrow zone of deformation and faster fault propagation in the same fault slip rate. The cracks develop at the fault tip area and free surface in the initial stage for the models with strong cover, and then the growth of cracks tend to link these two parts to produce a fracture zone propagating to surface.

For comparison, the tests were repeated using extrusions of AA 6061 -T 6 aluminum of the same geometry. For the axial compression tests, three different end geometries were considered, namely (1) a flat cutoff, (2) a 45 degree chamfer, and (3) a square circumferential notch. AZ 31 B extrusions with the 45 degree chamfer produced the most repeatable and stable deformation of a <b>progressive</b> <b>fracturing</b> nature, referred to as sharding, with an average SEA of 40 kJ/kg and an average CFE of 45 %, which are nearly equal {{to the performance of}} the AA 6061 -T 6. Both the AZ 31 B specimens with the flat cutoff and the circumferential notch conditions were more prone to tilt mid-test, and lead to an unstable helical fracture, which significantly reduced the SEA. Axial cutting of AA 6061 -T 6 extrusions {{has been shown to be}} an effective, ductile mode of energy dissipation, yielding a repeatable, nearly constant load/deflection response with a crush force efficiency (CFE) up to 96 %. In the present tests, the quasi-static cutting deformation of AZ 31 B extrusions achieved a respectable CFE of 80 %, but revealed a load/deflection response with sharp, minute, rapid fluctuations, indicating an undesirable fracturing failure. Additionally, the average specific energy absorption (SEA) of AZ 31 B was 11 kJ/kg, which is less than half that seen for AA 6061 -T 6 extrusions of the same geometry (24 kJ/kg).
