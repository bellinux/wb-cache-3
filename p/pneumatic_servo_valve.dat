A new approach to build the models is introduced in detail. This approach considers two distinct models: for simulation purposes, the air mass flow is determined for a given working pressure and command input; for control purposes, the command input is determined given the working pressure and the desired air mass flow. This approach {{enables the use of}} air mass flow as the synthesized control action, thus rendering the overall pneumatic system affine. Therefore, control techniques requiring this condition on the system model can be directly used.

40|$|This project aims {{to develop}} a novel large stroke {{asymmetric}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>servo</b> system of a hardware-in-the-loop for path tracking control under variable loads based on the MATLAB Simulink real-time system. High pressure compressed air provided by the air compressor is utilized for the <b>pneumatic</b> proportional <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> to drive the large stroke asymmetric rod-less pneumatic actuator. Due to the pressure differences between two chambers, the pneumatic actuator will operate. The highly nonlinear mathematical models of the large stroke asymmetric pneumatic system were analyzed and developed. The functional approximation technique based on the sliding mode controller (FASC) is developed as a controller to solve the uncertain time-varying nonlinear system. The MATLAB Simulink real-time system was a main control unit of a hardware-in-the-loop system proposed to establish driver blocks for analog and digital I/O, a linear encoder, a CPU and a large stroke asymmetric pneumatic rod-less system. By the position sensor, the position signals of the cylinder will be measured immediately.

Vilenus [18] applied trajectory {{sensitivity analysis}} to the valve-controlled cylinder system of the logging machine and the mathematical model of this system was simplified to fifth order model where the <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> flow-pressure nonlinearity and dead zone nonlinearity were taken into consideration. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis of ten main parameters containing viscous damping coefficient, conversion mass, internal leakage coefficient of servo cylinder, effective piston area of servo cylinder, effective bulk modulus, <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> gain, nature frequency of <b>servo</b> <b>valve,</b> damping ratio of <b>servo</b> <b>valve,</b> conversion coefficient and system supply oil pressure is obtained with parameters change 1 % under single working condition.

Furthermore, Farasat et al. [19] founded the fourth order linear mathematical model of the valve-controlled cylinder position control system where the <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> flow-pressure nonlinearity is linearized partially. The sensitivity of other parameters, such as <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> torque motor constant, <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> area constant, orifice opening of metering valve, system return oil pressure, supply oil volume, return oil volume and input signal voltage, is given with parameters change 1 % under single working condition by four sensitivity evaluation methods including VILENUS method, revised VILENUS method, Entirety index method and Individual characteristics method. The analysis results indicated that the sensitivity of effective piston area of servo cylinder, flow coefficient, conversion mass and input signal voltage is relatively small. Kong et al. [20 – 22] first established the fifth linear order mathematical model for the hydraulic drive unit of quadruped robot and derived the first order trajectory sensitivity formulas analysis. Aimed at the imprecise conclusion of sensitivity analysis obtained from the linear model, some nonlinear models are also established. Besides, the sensitivity mathematical expressions with nonlinear and time-varied parameters are derived under the trotting gait working conditions. Kong et al.
