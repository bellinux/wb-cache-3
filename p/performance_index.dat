5|$|Switzerland's {{ecosystems}} can {{be particularly}} fragile, because the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains often form unique ecologies. The mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable, with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes, and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing. The climatic, geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region make for a very fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to climate change. Nevertheless, according to the 2014 Environmental <b>Performance</b> <b>Index,</b> Switzerland ranks first among 132 nations in safeguarding the environment, due to its high scores on environmental public health, its heavy reliance on {{renewable sources of energy}} (hydropower and geothermal energy), and its control of greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we compute <b>performance</b> <b>indices</b> like those from Mereuta et all. (2007) using the {{eigenvalues}} and the eigenvectors of the variance-covariance matrix of these indices. The eigenvalues {{are used in}} this paper to give natural weights to the <b>performance</b> <b>indices</b> in order to compute the weighted competitiveness indicators, and their corresponding eigenvectors are used to obtain the desired uncorrelated <b>performance</b> <b>indices.</b> In order {{to point out the}} mutual influence in the case of each pair of the considered correlated <b>performance</b> <b>indices</b> we compute also their correlation matrix. After we order the composite <b>performance</b> <b>indices</b> (non-weighted or weighted) we classify them using either the maximum entropy principle, either the maximum separation (Chow breakpoint test). A comparison between the classifications using the weighted/non-weighted classifications using the maximum entropy principle and the maximum separation are also done in the paper. As application we consider the GDP per capita, the investment share in GDP, the unemployment rate, the Gini Index of income inequality and the share of consumption of renewal energy resources (five <b>performance</b> <b>indices)</b> for the 27 countries of European Union.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for monitoring {{the performance of}} control loops. The method determines <b>performance</b> <b>indices</b> using recursive relationships. The recursive formulation gives the method two desirable characteristics, namely, it is computationally efficient, and the memory requirements are small because only previous values of the <b>performance</b> <b>indices</b> are stored. Consequently, the method can be implemented in low-cost digital controllers, thereby reducing traffic on the communication network. Building operators can use the <b>performance</b> <b>indices</b> to quickly assess {{the performance of a}} large number of controllers. <b>Performance</b> <b>indices</b> may be used to quantify information about the amount of travel of an actuator, the difference between the desired process output and the actual output, saturation of a controller, etc. This paper presents laboratory and field test results demonstrating the utility of the <b>performance</b> <b>indices</b> for <b>performance</b> monitoring and fault detection in variable-air-volume air-handling units with pressure-independent variable-air-volume boxes...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an online adaptive {{strategy for the}} fault detection and diagnosis of centrifugal chiller systems.

A set of rules for faults and their impacts on the six <b>performance</b> <b>indexes</b> are deduced from theoretical analysis, and then serve as the fault classifier. The benchmarks of the <b>performance</b> <b>indexes</b> are provided by simplified reference models, whose parameter identification is simple. In addition, an online adaptive scheme is developed, by analyzing uncertainty coming from both model-fitting errors and measurement errors, to estimate and update the thresholds for detecting abnormal <b>performance</b> <b>indexes.</b> The FDD strategy is validated by both field data collected from a real building chiller system and by laboratory data provided by an ASHRAE research project.
