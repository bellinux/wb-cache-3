25|$|The {{amygdala}} is {{an important}} brain structure {{when it comes to}} learning fearful responses, in other words, it influences how people remember traumatic things. An increase in blood flow to this area has been shown when <b>people</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> scary faces, or remember traumatic events. Research has also shown that the lateral nucleus of the amygdala is a crucial site of neural changes that occur during fear conditioning.|$|E
25|$|When two <b>people</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> two {{different}} detectors that scan entangled particles, both observers will enter an indefinite state, as with one observer. These results need not agree – the second observer's mind {{does not have}} to have results that correlate with the first's. When one observer tells the results to the second observer, their two minds cannot communicate and thus will only interact with the other's body, which is still indefinite. When the second observer responds, its body will respond with whatever result agrees with the first observer's mind. This means that both observer's minds will be in a state of the wavefunction that always get the expected results, but individually their results could be different.|$|E

Both of them had prior experience with fan communities: Evans mentioned having {{been a member of}} message boards for the game The Sims 2 as a child and having nostalgic feelings for it, while Park said that although she did not miss old websites, bulletin board systems and mailing lists, they still were a part of her. Evans described the game's interactions as feeling like a real forum experience, saying that while <b>people</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> pixels at their screen, a real person is on the other side, and that both parties get to accept or reject the other, with the possibility of hurting them.|$|E

I am not a cheat and never have been. It was an instinctive reaction to a ball that was coming extremely fast in a crowded penalty area....As a footballer you do not have the luxury of the television to slow the pace of the ball down 100 times {{to be able to make}} a conscious decision...People are viewing a slow motion version of what happened and not what I or any other footballer faces in the game. If <b>people</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it in full speed you will see that it was an instinctive reaction.|$|E

[...] Smith also claimed in another interview that he never read his reviews for fear that they would interfere with his songwriting. It was during this period that Smith appeared on Dutch television in 1998 and provided a candid interview in which he spoke of his assessment of his music career until that point: ...|$|E

For ATLiens, the band aimed for a consistent set of songs {{in which a}} listener would not need to skip tracks; OutKast wrote around 35 songs for the album and reduced them to fourteen. The duo's songwriting style for the album had no solid structure and was mostly spontaneous; Big Boi noted, [...] "Stuff'll just come to you.

[...] Rankin said that [...] "the concept for the video was 3D" [...] to best portray how [...] "the <b>people</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> your relationships with an optimism that can't be seen from the inside."

500|$|Though {{he stands}} five feet, nine inches tall, Cammalleri's {{teammates}} have argued his small stature {{is not a}} drawback. While at Michigan, teammate Craig Murray said that [...] "a lot of <b>people</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his size and they hold it against him, but there's no one stronger out there." [...] On the ice, Cammalleri says he tries to play bigger than his opponents. His coach at Michigan, Red Berenson, agreed. He stated that Cammalleri played like he was [...] "6-foot-4" [...] with the puck and could beat any opponent one-on-one. The Hockey News rates his offensive skills and intelligence on the ice as his greatest strength, but notes {{that he can be}} inconsistent away from the puck. He is a natural goal scorer, and is capable of playing at either centre or on the wing. Injuries have been a concern for Cammalleri; his time in Montreal were marked by both shoulder and knee problems.|$|E
500|$|Timberlake did a joint tour in North America with Christina Aguilera {{entitled}} the Justified and Stripped Tour, to support both Justified and Aguilera's 2002 album, Stripped. Timberlake's and Aguilera's managers suggested to both singers {{to go on}} a conjoint tour. Timberlake agreed with the suggestion, saying that [...] "It would be fun to be on tour with somebody who's that talented". Timberlake's further reasoning for touring with Aguilera was due to both singers wanting to [...] "break the mold of what <b>people</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> as teen pop and move into a different direction". For the tour, Timberlake wanted to transform arenas into clubs, stating that he wants people [...] "to feel like they're a part of the show and it's a party", remarking that anybody caught sitting down would get booted. For the tour, Timberlake performed with eight dancers, a 14-piece band which included four backup singers, three horn players and a DJ. The tour commenced on June 4, 2003 in Phoenix, Arizona and concluded on September 2, 2003 in Saint Paul, Minnesota. The tour grossed approximately $45 million.|$|E

[...] Pollock's wife, Lee Krasner, said Pollock [...] "used to give his pictures conventional titles... but now he simply numbers them. Numbers are neutral.
