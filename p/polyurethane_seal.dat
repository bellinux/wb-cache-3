40|$|The {{corrosion}} protection of 6061 -T 6 anodized aluminum afforded by a newly patented <b>polyurethane</b> <b>seal</b> was studied using the ac impedance technique. Values {{of the average}} corrosion rates over a 27 -day exposure period in 3. 5 percent NaCl solutions at pH 5. 2 and pH 9. 5 compared very favorably for Lockheed-prepared polyurethane-sealed and dichromate-sealed coats of the same thickness. Average corrosion rates for both specimens over the first 7 days of exposure compared well with those for a hard anodized, dichromate-sealed coat, but rose well above those for the hard anodized coat over the entire 27 -day period. This is attributed both to the greater thickness of the hard anodized coat, and possibly to its inherently better corrosion protective capability...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} {{the main reasons}} for the leakage of hydraulic cylinder, analyzes {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} <b>polyurethane</b> <b>seal</b> rings for hydraulic cylinder reciprocating sealing, compares the performance and characteristics of several commonly-used reciprocating seals, and studies the sealing mechanism, material characteristics, effects of practical applications and gives the solution of Packing PTFE combined sealing. Presentation of the problems A key indicator of measuring and evaluating the quality of hydraulic cylinders is its leakage rate, and design departments, manufacturers and users have been obsessed with the leakage of hydraulic cylinders. Hydraulic cylinder’s leakage, not only reduces its volumetric efficiency, increases power loss, and even affects the normal functioning of the hydraulic cylinder and even the machine[1, 2]. Then, why do hydraulic cylinders leak? How do we deal with the leakage of hydraulic cylinders? We have made a comprehensive statistics and analysis of the reasons for the leakage of the hydraulic cylinders in process produced by a company. The results show that there are following causes of the leakage of hydraulic cylinders [3 - 7]: Quality defects of seal itself. Components defects of base and formula process, aging of sealin...|$|E
40|$|The valve {{and seat}} in modern mud pumps {{for oil and}} gas well {{drilling}} are expendable pump parts. New types of valve with a damper chamber without rubber or <b>polyurethane</b> <b>seal</b> and with metal-to-metal contact area and heavy-duty load bearing capacity have been elaborated [1]. Lighter weight body of plate characterizes this design. In comparison with the valve of ordinary construction a valve with a damper chamber contains additional struc-tural elements, which in the moment of setting on of the plate forms the chamber of the pro-moted pressure between a seat and plate. It is considered that application of damper cham-ber will decrease the shock loadings or “hammer-effect ” at the setting of plate. However, for development of reliable working construction it is necessary to resolve next basic problems: – to calculate the optimum size of clearances in damper chamber, – to define speed of landing of plate at the entrance in a damper chamber, – to overcome hydroabrasive wear in the clearances of damper chamber as a result of high speeds of mud flow. It is possible to resolve first two problems by the mathematical model of work of mud pump valve with a damper chamber. For possibility of resolving of mathematical model it is necessary to define the coefficient of discharge in valve by the computer design of fluid flow, as a nonlinear function depending on the height of getting up of plate above a seat. The computer three-dimensional parametric model of valve with a damper chamber has been developed for the valve assembly No. 7 of triplex single action pump. A paramet-ric model gives a possibility to change the height of getting up of plate H and the geometri-cal parameters of seat and plate and clearances in damper chamber. By a programmatic complex CosmosFlowWorks®, which will realize the finite ele-ment method for the tasks of hydrogasdynamics the value of speeds of stream and pressure was calculated in the area of landing of plate (Fig. 1). It gave possibility to calculate the co...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{artificial}} ageing of beech wood coated with Zn/ZnO particles {{by means of}} a cold plasma spraying process as well as coating systems including a Zn/ZnO layer and additional conventional sealings were examined. As ascertained by colour measurements, the particle coatings significantly decreased UV light-induced discolouration. Even though no significant colour changes were observed for particle-coated and alkyd-sealed samples, ATR-FTIR measurements revealed photocatalytic degradation of the alkyd matrix. In contrast, the <b>polyurethane</b> <b>sealing</b> appeared to be stabilised by the Zn/ZnO coating. Furthermore, morphologic properties of the pure particle coatings were studied by SEM and roughness measurements. SEM measurements confirmed a melting and solidifying process during deposition...|$|R

40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's Pittsburgh Research Laboratory {{conducted}} a full-scale {{test of a}} composite polyurethane-aggregate seal in a hydrostatic chamber at the Lake Lynn Experimental Mine. This composite seal consisted of a polyurethane and limestone aggregate core that was formed between two concrete block walls. In the hydrostatic chamber test, water is used to pressurize the seal. During the test, the maximum average water pressure the seal was able to withstand was 18. 9 psi. Further, the seal began to yield at an average water pressure of only 17 psi. At {{the time of the}} test, the minimum seal design requirement was 20 psi under 30 CFR 4 75. 335 (2005). Therefore, based on this test, the seal did not meet the regulatory minimum design requirement. Uniaxial compressive tests conducted on samples from the polyurethane-aggregate core revealed that both the compressive strength and the elastic modulus of the material were much less than that for polyurethane only with a density of 10. 0 - 12. 0 lb/ft 3. The significant reduction in the strength and stiffness of the polyurethane-aggregate mixture results from the formation of a soft polyurethane foam around each piece of aggregate. The formation of the soft foam seems to be caused by residual moisture from the aggregate. The moisture also caused the density of the polyurethane in the polyurethane-aggregate mixture to be less than the design requirements. The lower density of the polyurethane in the mixture, along with the formation of zones of pure polyurethane only, resulted in the overall seal density being less than the design requirements. During seal construction, steps were taken to control the moisture, but were not successful. An analysis of the seal failure showed that the calculated shear stresses at failure and the estimated shear strength of the polyurethane-aggregate mixture are fairly close. This suggests that the strength properties of the polyurethane-aggregate mixture along with a weak zone of poorly bonded aggregate controlled the maximum pressure the seal could withstand. At the time of the seal testing, the minimum design requirement was 20 psi, as specified at 30 CFR 75. 335 (2005). New emergency temporary standards for seal designs were promulgated on May 22, 2007, with a minimum requirement of 50 psi under specified conditions. However, it will be shown that the evaluation of the <b>polyurethane</b> <b>seal</b> performance as designed to meet the older 20 -psi criterion can be relevant to the design requirements under the new standards.

40|$|The {{effects of}} radial force (interface) {{produced}} by interference on the static contact properties and frictional {{characteristics of a}} radial lip seal are investigated by experimentally. For this reason, a test system has been developed. In this test system, a cylinder is placed on four load cells in order to monitor the friction torque generated between seal and counter face. A group of experiments are carried out with thermoplastic <b>polyurethane</b> radial lip <b>seals.</b> Three different inner diameters (40, 39. 80 and 39. 60 mm) are selected and the seals are tested under 0. 5 and 0. 3 bar for a short period.

As a result, {{it is observed that}} the amount of interference effects seal friction torques based on seal material and seal design in different ratios. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{message in the}} report of A. T. M. Tang and associates [1] concerns the essential role of continuous vacuum in sternotomy wound infections healing process. Dressings by <b>polyurethane</b> foam <b>sealed</b> by transparent adhe-sive drape in fact are changed only once every 48 h, since wound toilette and purulent material removal actually relies on a sophisticate intermittent high suction vacuum system. We have adopted a conceptually similar, closed technique for super®cial wound infections. After a favourable experi-ence with a two stage approach [2], consisting in prelimin-ary debridement, followed, a few days later, by a surgical closure {{by means of a}}dvancement ¯aps and multiple high suctions drains, we now carry out primary closure of the infected super®cial tissues. When a super®cial sternal wound infection is diagnosed, surgical debridement is carried out; a suf®cient number of small high suction drains (Riplast; Neukirchen-Saar, Germany) are positioned and the skin is immediately closed by means of a continuous mono-®lament suture. High suction is continued until no more material is drained, usually after 7 ± 8 days. We have treated 15 patients by this method with good results; only in one case a further debridement was necessary with second inten-tion healing. Cosmetic results were very satisfactorily in the remaining 14 patients. Mean hospital stay after infection diagnosis was 9 ^ 2 days. We believe that, when possible, immediate skin closure after debridement over an ef®cient and continuous vacuum system, may be in most cases as effective as the polyurethane foam and adhesive sealant drape medication, offering better cosmetic results...|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effect of the Lanz system on air sealing by self-inflation in high volume-low pressure (HVLP) tube cuffs. Methods: In vitro tracheal air sealing was studied in HVLP tracheal tube cuffs (internal diameter [ID] 8. 0 mm) made from <b>polyurethane</b> ([PU] <b>Seal</b> Guard tracheal tube, Covidien, Athlone, Ireland) and from polyvinylchloride ([PVC] HiLo tracheal tube, Covidien) with and without Lanz pressure regulating valve. Tube cuffs were placed in a vertical 22 mm ID artificial trachea and inflated to 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 cm H(2) O cuff pressures. Pressure control ventilation with peak inspiratory pressures (PIPs) of 20 or 25 cm H(2) O was applied and air leakage was assessed spirometrically as the ratio of expiratory to inspiratory tidal volumes. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was applied to compare the air leakage with and without Lanz system for both cuff types at each cuff pressure and PIP (P <. 05). Results: The PVC tube cuffs with Lanz system resulted in significant air leakage at both 20 and 25 cm H(2) O PIP as compared to those without the Lanz system, especially at cuff pressures lower than the preset PIP (P <. 05). Although PU tube cuffs with Lanz system showed reduced air sealing when compared with cuffs without Lanz, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Cuff pressure compensation with the Lanz system during cyclic respiratory pressure changes interferes with the self-sealing mechanism in HVLP tube cuffs at cuff pressures lower than PIP level. This results in larger air leak across tube cuffs particularly in tube cuffs made from PVC...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFO) to predict red blood cell trauma (hemolysis) in blood pumps based on their exposure to turbulent stresses has increased in recent years. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has initiated a project to determine the fidelity with which modern CFO can accurately predict hemolysis in such devices. The project involves the collection of experimental data against which externally-conducted CFO simulations may be compared. Because the data {{will be used to}} judge the ability of CFO to predict hemolysis, the pump was designed to cause more turbulence and blood damage than would be typical of an approved clinical device. In support of this effort, a shaft-driven centrifugal blood pump was constructed for use in both quantitative flow visualization analysis and in blood-damage experiments. The hydraulic performance of the pump was measured to determine the degree to which it represented a typical blood pump. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to measure planar velocity fields in three different regions of the pump including the blade passage, impeller rear-gap, and cutwater region. For all PIV experiments, the pump delivered volumetric flow rates of 0. 6, 3. 0, and 6. 0 liters per minute (LPM), each at a constant shaft speed of 2800 RPM. Statistical analysis was performed on each PIV data set {{in order to determine the}} time-averaged velocity fields as well as to resolve turbulent quantities of interest to the prediction of hemolysis (namely the Reynolds shear stresses). Additionally, the pump was operated using bovine blood as the working fluid in order to measure the hemolysis caused at the same operating points measured during PIV experiments. Further experiments were conducted to determine the contribution of the pump 2 ̆ 7 s shaft-seal interface to the total measured hemolysis. The pump 2 ̆ 7 s hydrodynamic performance was measured to be a close match to that of a typical clinical blood pump. PIV analysis revealed that the velocity and shear stress fields within the pump were dependent on its operating point, and can thus serve as benchmarking data against which to compare CFO analyses. Finally, the pump was confirmed to produce measurable hemolysis. The contribution of a <b>polyurethane</b> shaft <b>seal</b> to the measured hemolysis was significant (39...|$|R
