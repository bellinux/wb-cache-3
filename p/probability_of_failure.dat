2500|$|When {{applied to}} {{real-world}} problems, outcomes {{of success and}} failure {{may or may not be}} outcomes we ordinarily view as good and bad, respectively. Suppose we used the negative binomial distribution to model the number of days a certain machine works before it breaks down. In this case [...] "success" [...] would be the result on a day when the machine worked properly, whereas a breakdown would be a [...] "failure". If we used the negative binomial distribution to model the number of goal attempts a sportsman makes before scoring r goals, though, then each unsuccessful attempt would be a [...] "success", and scoring a goal would be [...] "failure". If we are tossing a coin, then the negative binomial distribution can give the number of heads ("success") we are likely to encounter before we encounter a certain number of tails ("failure"). In the probability mass function below, p is the probability of success, and (1−p) is the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E

There {{can remain}} {{no doubt that}} the {{property}} of inducing combination, which can thus be conferred upon masses of platina and other metals by connecting them with the poles of the battery, or by cleansing processes either of a mechanical or chemical nature, is the same as that which was discovered by Döbereiner[A], in 1823, to belong in so eminent a degree to spongy platina, and which was afterwards so well experimented upon and illustrated by MM. Dulong and Thenard[B], in 1823. The latter philosophers even quote experiments in which a very fine platina wire, which had been coiled up and digested in nitric, sulphuric, or muriatic acid, became ignited when put into a jet of hydrogen gas[C]. This effect I can now produce at pleasure with either wires or plates by the processes described (570. 601. 605.); and by using a smaller plate cut so that it shall rest against the glass by a few points, and yet allow the water to flow off (fig. 59.), the loss of heat is less, the metal is assimilated somewhat to the spongy state, and the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> almost entirely removed.|$|E
