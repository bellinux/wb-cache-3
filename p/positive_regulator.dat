25|$|The CLN3 gene was {{originally}} {{identified as the}} whi1-1 allele in a screen for small size mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (for Cln3's role in size control, see below). This screen {{was inspired by a}} similar study in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, in which the Wee1 gene was identified as an inhibitor of cell cycle progression that maintained normal cell size. Thus, the WHI1 gene was at first thought to perform a size control function analogous to that of Wee1 in pombe. However, it was later found that WHI1 was in fact a <b>positive</b> <b>regulator</b> of Start, as its deletion caused cells to delay in G1 and grow larger than wild-type cells. The original WHI1-1 allele (changed from whi1-1 because it is a dominant allele) in fact contained a nonsense mutation that removed a degradation-promoting PEST sequence from the Whi1 protein and thus accelerated G1 progression. WHI1 was furthermore found to be a cyclin homologue, and it was shown that simultaneous deletion of WHI1—renamed CLN3—and the previously identified G1 cyclins, CLN1 and CLN2, caused permanent G1 arrest. This showed that the three G1 cyclins were responsible for controlling Start entry in budding yeast.|$|E

5000|$|The primary {{molecular}} mechanism {{behind an}} oscillating gene is {{best described as}} a transcription/translation feedback loop. This loop contains both <b>positive</b> <b>regulators,</b> which increase gene expression, and negative regulators, which decrease gene expression. The fundamental elements of these loops are found across different phyla. In the mammalian circadian clock, for example, transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1 are the <b>positive</b> <b>regulators.</b> CLOCK and BMAL1 bind to the E-box of oscillating genes, such as Per1, Per2, and Per3 and Cry1 and Cry2, and upregulate their transcription. When the PERs and CRYs form a heterocomplex in the cytoplasm and enter the nucleus again, they inhibit their own transcription. [...] This means that over time the mRNA and protein levels of PERs and CRYs, or any other oscillating gene under this mechanism, will oscillate.|$|R

40|$|Influenza A viruses may cross species {{barriers}} and transmit to humans {{with the potential}} to cause pandemics. Interplay of human- (PB 2 627 K) and avian-like (PB 2 627 E) influenza polymerase complexes with unknown host factors have been postulated to {{play a key role in}} interspecies transmission. Here, we have identified human importin-a isoforms (a 1 and a 7) as <b>positive</b> <b>regulators</b> of human- but not avian-like polymerase activity. Human-like polymerase activity correlated with efficient recruitment of a 1 and a 7 to viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) without affecting subcellular localization. We also observed that human-like influenza virus growth was impaired in a 1 and a 7 downregulated human lung cells. Mice lacking a 7 were less susceptible to human- but not avian-like influenza virus infection. Thus, a 1 and a 7 are <b>positive</b> <b>regulators</b> of human-like polymerase activity and pathogenicity beyond their role in nuclear transport...|$|R

40|$|Cancer is {{frequently}} {{considered to be}} a disease of the cell cycle. As such, {{it is not surprising that}} the deregulation of the cell cycle is one of the most frequent alterations during tumor development. Cell cycle progression is a highlyordered and tightly-regulated process that involves multiple checkpoints that assess extracellular growth signals, cell size, and DNA integrity. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their cyclin partners are <b>positive</b> <b>regulators</b> or accelerators that induce cell cycle progression; whereas, cyclindependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) that act as brakes to stop cell cycle progression in response to regulatory signals are important negative regulators. Cancer originates from the abnormal expression or activation of <b>positive</b> <b>regulators</b> and functional suppression of negative regulators. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of the deregulation of cell cycle progression in cancer can provide important insights into how normal cells become tumorigenic, as well as how new cancer treatment strategies can be designed...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of the Escherichia coli capsular polysaccharide varies with growth medium, temperature of growth, and genetic background. lac fusions to genes necessary for capsule synthesis (cps) demonstrated that these genes are regulated negatively in vivo by the lon gene product. We have now isolated, characterized, and mapped mutations in three new regulatory genes (rcs, for regulator of capsule synthesis) that control expression of these same fusions. rcsA and rcsB are <b>positive</b> <b>regulators</b> of capsule synthesis. rcsA is located at min 43 on the E. coli map, whereas rcsB lies at 47 min. rcsC, a negative regulator of capsule synthesis, is located at min 47, close to rcsB. All three regulatory mutations are unlinked to either the structural genes cpsA-F or lon. Mutations in all three rcs genes are recessive to the wild type. We postulate that lon may regulate capsule synthesis indirectly, by regulating the availability {{of one of the}} <b>positive</b> <b>regulators...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Arabidopsis genome encodes {{a number}} of {{proteins}} with similarity to two-component phosphorelay signaling elements, including hybrid receptor histidine kinases, two classes of response regulator proteins (type-A and type-B ARRs) and a family of six histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins (AHPs), five of which contain a conserved His residue that is required for phosphorelay signaling. The current model for cytokinin signaling includes a multistep phosphorelay: three histidine kinases and at least five type-B ARRs {{have been shown to}} act as <b>positive</b> <b>regulators</b> of cytokinin signaling, while {{a number of}} type-A ARRs, and AHP 6, act as negative regulators of the pathway. In our recent Plant Cell paper, we provided genetic evidence that at least four AHPs can act as <b>positive</b> <b>regulators</b> of cytokinin signaling, affecting responses to cytokinin in the root and the shoot.
