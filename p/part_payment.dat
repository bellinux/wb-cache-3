25|$|Roach {{had founded}} the Delaware {{shipyard}} {{in anticipation of}} a boom in iron shipbuilding in the United States. He was soon to discover that he had seriously underestimated the conservatism of American shipping lines, most of whom were content to continue ordering the familiar wooden-hulled paddle steamers in spite of the proven advantages of iron hulls and screw propulsion. In order to attract more business, Roach tried reducing the entry cost of purchase by offering to buy shares in the ships he sold, taking a corresponding ratio of their future earnings as <b>part</b> <b>payment</b> for their construction. In this way he found himself gradually accumulating substantial interests {{in a number of different}} shipping lines.|$|E

But he now had to decide whether to foreclose on Pacific Mail in order to secure at least some of his investment in the ships, or to renegotiate the payment plan. He chose the latter, accepting Pacific Mail's old ships for their scrap value as <b>part</b> <b>payment,</b> and reducing its monthly payment obligation from $75,000 to $35,000. Roach was embittered by the affair, but ironically, his handling of the crisis increased his reputation as a businessman able to deal with adverse circumstances.|$|E

500|$|Denning {{gave the}} leading {{judgment}} in D & C Builders Ltd v Rees [...] 2 QB 617 in 1965. D & C Builders Ltd (the respondent) {{had been hired}} by Rees (the appellant) to do some construction work at his shop, where he sold building materials. EWCA Civ 3 (12 November 1965) |publisher=BAILII|accessdate=6 May 2009}} The respondent finished the work and repeatedly phoned the appellant to request the money they were owed. After three phone calls spread out over several months the appellant's wife spoke to the respondents; she said there were several problems with the work that they had done, and she would only pay £300 of the £482 owed. The respondents replied that £300 would barely {{cover the costs of}} the materials, but that they would accept it anyway. If the respondents had not received the money they would have gone bankrupt, something the appellant's wife was well aware of. In his judgment, Denning modified English case law on <b>part</b> <b>payment</b> and accord and satisfaction, saying that the rules on <b>part</b> <b>payment</b> can be set aside in situations where one of the parties is under duress. The fact that D & C Builders were effectively forced into accepting the lesser amount meant that the payment was not valid.|$|E

Pellew, in his report on the action, stated that [...] "the cripped state of the Enemy allows me the Opportunity of saying, that her Resiliance could have been of no Avail, had the Artois been alone", but historian William James was more reserved, noting in 1827 that the ships [...] "would have been a well matched pair of combatants, had the Artois been alone." [...] The prize money was extensive: <b>part</b> <b>payment</b> of £10,000 (£ as of [...] ) was made in January 1795, the reward shared between the entire squadron. Pellew, who had been knighted the previous year following the Action of 18 June 1793, {{was reported to be}} unhappy that Nagle had been honoured for his part in this action and complained to the Admiralty about the condition and speed of Arethusa, requesting a faster vessel. The following year he would receive command of the 44-gun razee HMS Indefatigable as a result.|$|E
500|$|Vargo Statten Science Fiction Magazine (later Vargo Statten British Science Fiction Magazine, The British Science Fiction Magazine and The British Space Fiction Magazine) was a British {{science fiction}} {{magazine}} which published nineteen issues between 1954 and 1956.

500|$|The {{scientific}} {{subjects of}} Wright's paintings {{from this time}} were meant {{to appeal to the}} wealthy scientific circles in which he moved. While never a member himself, he had strong connections with the Lunar Society: he was friends with members John Whitehurst and Erasmus Darwin, as well as Josiah Wedgwood, who later commissioned paintings from him. The inclusion of the moon in the painting was a nod to their monthly meetings, which were held when the moon was full. Like The Orrery, Wright apparently painted Air Pump without a commission, and the picture was purchased by Dr Benjamin Bates, who already owned Wright's Gladiator. An Aylesbury physician, patron of the arts and hedonist, Bates was a diehard member of the Hellfire Club who, despite his excesses, lived to be over 90. Wright's account book shows a number of prices for the painting: Pd£200 is shown in one place and £210 in another, but Wright had written to Bates asking for £130, stating that the low price [...] "might much injure me in the future sale of my pictures, and when I send you a receipt for the money I shall acknowledge a greater sum." [...] Whether Bates ever paid the full amount is not recorded; Wright only notes in his account book that he received £30 in <b>part</b> <b>payment.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Estoppel is an {{equitable}} (as opposed to common law) construct {{and is therefore}} discretionary.

The Mark IIIs were unsuited for operations with Albatross, particularly as the aircraft were not durable enough to withstand catapult launches. Specifications for a new aircraft design were drawn up to the RAN and RAAF, and Supermarine designed the Seagull V (later to be called the Walrus). Designed for catapult launches and to survive rougher weather and sea conditions, the Walrus entered service two months after Albatross was reduced to non-seagoing status.
