50|$|Almost 90% {{of plastic}} debris that pollutes ocean water, which {{translates}} to 5.6 million tons, comes from ocean-based sources. Merchant ships expel cargo, sewage, used medical equipment, {{and other types}} of waste that contain plastic into the ocean. Naval and research vessels also eject waste and military equipment that are deemed unnecessary. <b>Pleasure</b> <b>crafts</b> also release fishing gear {{and other types of}} waste. These different ships do not have enough storage space to keep these pollutants on the ship, and thus they are discarded. These plastic items can also accidentally end up in the water through negligent handling. The largest ocean-based source of plastic pollution is discarded fishing gear, responsible for up to 90% of plastic debris in some areas. This equipment includes a variety of traps and nets.|$|E
