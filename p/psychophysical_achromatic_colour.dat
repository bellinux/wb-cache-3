40|$|Four {{experiments}} are reported, {{the aim of}} which was to explore the achromatic-colour and distance relations that determine the probability of achromatic surfaces grouping perceptually. The first two experiments were performed to test Wertheimer's conjecture that similarity and dissimilarity of <b>achromatic</b> <b>colours</b> jointly determine grouping. The results indicate that only similarity of <b>achromatic</b> <b>colours</b> determines grouping. Data from the other two experiments show that grouping is determined by absolute, relative, and Gillam's distances. These findings agree with previous literature showing that different algorithms or mechanisms determine grouping by similarity and grouping by distance. Additionally, these findings show that the single factor of grouping by distance also depends on multiple algorithms or mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{algebraic}} luminance difference {{corresponding to}} a uniform achromatic surface on a uniform achromatic background determines the dark or light {{quality and the}} extent of this quality in the <b>achromatic</b> <b>colour</b> of the surface, while the absolute value of this difference determines the amount of perceived contrast between the <b>achromatic</b> <b>colours</b> of the surface and of the background. The results of an experiment designed to test whether grouping of achromatic surfaces depends on one or on both of these differences are here reported. Grouping was found to depend prevailingly on algebraic luminance difference in some subjects, prevailingly on absolute luminance differences in other subjects, and on both of these differences with similar probabilities in still other subjects...|$|R

40|$|Colour {{constancy}} in perceptual transparency {{has been}} mostly studied using filters partially superimposed on variegated stimuli, that is, on stimuli with areas having one part visible directly {{and the other}} part visible through the filter. The problem of whether colour constancy also occurs when variegated stimuli are completely covered by a filter has been studied less often and with mixed results. In two experiments {{we found that the}} grey colours of the areas of an achromatic Mondrian completely covered by an achromatic filter differ from the expected grey colours, that is, the grey colours of the respective areas of the same Mondrian viewed without the filter. Our results show poor <b>achromatic</b> <b>colour</b> constancy. Depending on the filter and the colour of the areas of the Mondrian, the grey colours of the Mondrian seen through the filter shifted from the expected grey colour by up to more than two Munsell steps in the 10 -step grey scale. We also found that the <b>achromatic</b> <b>colour</b> shifts caused by failure of constancy were asymmetrical. That is, under the filter, the lighter areas were darker and the darker areas were lighter than expected. This asymmetry occurred both when the background outside the filter was white or black...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} in three separate experiments the perceived <b>achromatic</b> <b>colour,</b> transparency, and phenomenal attributes of concentric-circle neon-brightness-spreading displays. Stimuli {{were obtained by}} varying the luminances of the outer arc (OA) and inner arc (IA) of circle, while keeping the background luminance constant. In the first experiment, observers modified the luminance of an adjustable region to match the <b>achromatic</b> <b>colour</b> of the central area of the displays; additional adjustments were performed on sets of control figures without IA (subjective figures) and without OA. In the second experiment, observers judged the transparency of the central area of the displays using either numerical ratings or dichotomous judgments. In the third experiment, they used four possible categories (light, shadow, filter, opaque) to describe {{the appearance of the}} displays. Only displays with intermediate background luminance were perceived as non-transparent. Displays with intermediate IA luminance were seen as transparent filters, whereas those with intermediate OA luminance were categorised as either lights or shadows, depending on luminance polarity. Adjustment data show that a simple contrast rule accounts well for induction effects in OA-only and IA-only figures. Data concerning complete figures show an interaction between OA and IA luminances in determining the percept; in particular, the contrast effect of OA luminance appears modulated by IA luminance in a nonmonotonic fashion. We discuss the implications of these findings on our current understanding of the mechanisms of neon brightness and colour spreading...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine whether {{fostering}} positive activating affect during multimedia learning enhances learning outcome. University students were randomly assigned to either a multimedia learning environment designed to induce positive activating affect through the use of “warm” colours and rounded shapes (n= 61) or an affectively neutral environment that used <b>achromatic</b> <b>colours</b> and sharp edges (n= 50). Participants learned about the topic of functional neuroanatomy for 20 minutes and had to answer several questions for comprehension and transfer afterwards. Affective states as well as achievement goal orientations were investigated before and after the learning phase using questionnaires. The results show that participants in the affectively positive environment were superior in comprehension as well as transfer when initial affect was strong. Preexperimental positive affect was therefore a predictor of comprehension and a moderator for transfer. Goal orientations did not influence these effects. The findings support the idea that positive affect, induced through the design of the particular multimedia learning environment, can facilitate performance if initial affective states are taken into account...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} informally shown [Gilchrist et al, 1999 Psychological Review 106 795 - 834; Adelson, 2000, in The New Cognitive Neurosciences Ed. M Gazzaniga (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press) ] that {{simultaneous}} lightness contrast (SLC) is enhanced when {{the dark and}} light surrounds of the classic display are replaced by articulated fields of equivalent average luminances. We explored this effect systematically, by comparing dark and light homogeneous and articulated surrounds in all possible combinations. Relative to their surrounds, the two targets could be double increments in luminance, double decrements, or one increment and one decrement. Observers adjusted the luminance of one target to match the <b>achromatic</b> <b>colour</b> of the other. Gilchrist et al's (1999) anchoring model accounts for increased SLC on articulated surrounds by assuming that (i) SLC occurs because in the local framework (target plus immediate surround) the incremental target is white rather than grey, and (ii) increasing the articulation of such a surround causes a stronger weighting of the local framework, thus magnifying {{the difference between the}} two targets. Our results are consistent with the first but not with the second assumption, and are discussed in the light of a modified version of the anchoring model...|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} grey shades in {{a visual}} scene {{can be derived}} from relative luminance values only when an anchoring rule is given. The anchoring theory of lightness (Gilchrist et al, 1999 Psychological Review 106 795 - 834) assumes that the highest luminance is perceived as white, and the appearance of all the other regions depends on their relationship to such white. It is thus a crucial prediction of the theory that equal regions representing luminance increments relative to their surrounds shall be perceived as identical. Our stimuli were incremental targets on two uniform surrounds placed side by side. We used the method of adjustment: observers varied the luminance of the test patch (set on a black surround) to match the <b>achromatic</b> <b>colour</b> of the comparison patch (set on a variable surround). We found that a target on a black surround looks always lighter than the same target on a more luminant surround. Previous failures to observe double-increment illusions may have been {{due to the fact that}} the strength of the effect rests on the specific luminances of the target and of the pair of surrounds chosen for the display...|$|R
40|$|Each year {{millions}} of greyscale reproductions of colour images are made. The {{majority of these}} are produced by removing the chromatic information, which leaves a greyscale made by just the <b>achromatic</b> <b>colour</b> variable. One problem with this approach is {{how to make a}} greyscales for images that contain equilumiant edges and/or borders in a way that preserves the image content In our experiment we evaluated some of the more recent algorithmic attempts to tackle the colour-to-greyscale problem, and compared the performance of these methods against greyscale images created manually by human observers. We used an image preference experiment where 10 participants carried out pair-wise comparisons of greyscales produced by 5 different mathematical algorithms and 1 human. Overall, we employed 10 different test images with varying amounts of equiluminant detail, and included images with different levels of content complexity (ranging from outdoor scenes to pie charts). We find that two algorithms significantly outperform the other computational techniques (including luminance), and that these algorithms both attempt to preserve local colour contrast in the greyscale algorithms. Furthermore, we find that neither of these techniques is significantly preferred over human greyscales. Finally, the interactions between images and algorithm are strong, indicating that image content is important in deciding which is the best greyscale version. These results support the motivation for this research area: there are better ways to convert colour to greyscale than simply using luminance and that images created by human observers are comparable to those produced by algorithms...|$|R
30|$|The {{patterns}} {{we investigated}} {{are black and}} white, but individual cones are red, green or blue (M, L or S), and RGCs of different types exhibit different colour opponency properties and prevalences and thus different resolutions for different opponent colours. Thus, the contrasts for {{a black and white}} image that occur in the retina must be mediated by B–Y or R–G opponents, with the former being primary in mammals [137]. To explore the different spatial frequency characteristics of different RGC types, DeValois and DeValois [138] investigated both chromatic and achromatic versions of the checkerboard illusion. For chromatic and achromatic images of the same size, they demonstrated the assimilation in chromatic checkerboards where there was contrast for the achromatic version. They explained that assimilation effect is due to the chromatic system having much lower spatial frequencies compared to the achromatic system. For the Tile Illusions, Westheimer [139] investigate an isoluminant heterochromatic version of one sample Bulge pattern [109] and suggest that the illusion can disappear when the black and white tiles are replaced by isoluminant ones. Although this is not clear in the isoluminant version presented in the article, it can be expected for the above reasons at certain sizes and scales. More psychophysical experiments are needed to clarify the role of colour in Tile Illusions, including testing these illusions in both chromatic and <b>achromatic</b> versions on <b>colour</b> blind people as well as normal subjects. Shapiro [140] developed a quantitative model for the visual response of the cone cells with two separate pathways, one for luminance and chromatic information and one for contrast information. He presented the output of the model for disc-ring stimulus containing two discs of identical chromaticity and luminance, one surrounded by light ring and one surrounded by a dark ring. He showed that the contrast pathway appears to have a faster response compared to the colour pathway (Fig.  5 in [140]). A quantitative model of <b>achromatic</b> <b>colour</b> computation of similar stimulus used in [140] has been investigated by Rudd and Zemach [141] based on a distance-dependent edge integration mechanism. They have shown the outperformance of the edge integration model over the highest luminance rules of Anchoring theory [26].|$|R

Warmth is a prominent characteristic of interior architecture and is related to colours and materials. Although the effects of single colours and single materials on warmth have been explored, colours and materials rarely appear alone in interiors {{and there has been}} no research on how paired colours and paired materials affect warmth perception in interiors. Therefore, the main aim {{of this study is to}} investigate their effects through a seven-point semantic differential scale and open ended questions. 192 different participants assessed three different colours (red, white, and green), and their pairs or three different materials (fabric, timber, and plasterboard), and their pairs under controlled conditions. Findings demonstrated that single colours and paired colours both affect warmth perception in interiors. The effects of single colours in interiors are subtle in warmth perception: red is perceived warmer than green and green is perceived warmer than white. All single colours have a moderate level of warmth in interiors as pairs, consequently red (warm colour) appears to increase and white (<b>achromatic</b> <b>colour)</b> appears to decrease the warmth perception of their pairs. Furthermore, as single materials timber and fabric have the same level of warmth and are warmer than plasterboard whereas there is not any difference between pairs. Findings indicated that natural materials are perceived warmer than artificial one. by Begüm Ulusoy. Ph. D...|$|R

Participants first watched a short video showing an overlook of a 3 D model of a living room. Next, they were asked to match the distinct coloured living rooms with facial expressions of six basic emotions that covers anger, disgust, surprise, happiness, fear, sadness and in addition with neutral. The results of the study indicated that the most stated emotions associated for the room with red walls were disgust and happiness, while the least stated emotions were sadness, fear, anger, and surprise.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyThis thesis {{investigates the}} role of colour in the {{cognitive}} processesing of emotional information. The research is guided by the effect of colour diagnosticity which has been shown previously to influence recognition performance of several types of objects as well as natural scenes. The research presented in Experiment 1 examined whether colour information is considered a diagnostic perceptual feature of seven emotional categories: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise and neutral. Participants (N = 119), who were naïve to the specific purpose and expectations of the experiment, chose colour {{more than any other}} perceptual quality (e. g. shape and tactile information) as a feature that describes the seven emotional categories. The specific colour features given for the six basic emotions were consistently different from those given to the non-emotional neutral category. While emotional categories were often described by chromatic colour features (e. g. red, blue, orange) the neutral category was often ascribed <b>achromatic</b> <b>colour</b> features (e. g. white, grey, transparent) as the most symptomatic perceptual qualities for its description. The emotion 'anger' was unique in being the only emotion showing an agreement higher that 50 % of the total given colour features for one particular colour - red. Confirming that colour is a diagnostic feature of emotions led to the examination of the effect of diagnostic colours of emotion on recognition memory for emotional words and faces: the effect, if any, of appropriate and inappropriate colours (matched with emotion) on the strength of memory for later recognition of faces and words (Experiments 2 & 3). The two experiments used retention intervals of 15 minutes and one week respectively and the colour-emotion associations were determined for each individual participant. Results showed that regardless of the subject’s consistency level in associating colours with emotions, and compared with the individual inappropriate or random colours, individual appropriate colours of emotions significantly enhance recognition memory for six basic emotional faces and words. This difference between the individual inappropriate colours or random colours and the individual appropriate colours of emotions was not found to be significant for non-emotional neutral stimuli. Post hoc findings from both experiments further show that appropriate colours of emotion are associated more consistently than inappropriate colours of emotions. This suggests that appropriate colour-emotion associations are unique both in their strength of association and in the form of their representation. Experiment 4 therefore aimed to investigate whether appropriate colour-emotion associations also trigger an implicit automatic cognitive system that allows faster naming times for appropriate versus inappropriate colours of emotional word carriers. Results from the combined Emotional-Semantic Stroop task confirm the above hypothesis and therefore imply that colour plays a substantial role not only in our conceptual representations of objects but also in our conceptual representations of basic emotions. The resemblance of the present findings collectively to those found previously for objects and natural scenes suggests a common cognitive mechanism for the processing of emotional diagnostic colours and the processing of diagnostic colours of objects or natural scenes. Overall, this thesis provides the foundation for many future directions of {{research in the area of}} colour and emotion as well as a few possible immediate practical implications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In many bird species, males display colour-ful, usually {{carotenoid}} or structurally based plumage ornaments. On {{the other}} hand, {{there are many}} bird species and entire avian genera that are achromatic, i. e. with predominantly white, grey and black plumage <b>colours.</b> <b>Achromatic</b> plumage is a typical feature in many shrikes for example. In this study, we examine the importance of an achromatic plumage pattern, namely, the black tail spots on the two outermost tail feathers (T 6 and T 5) of Lesser Grey Shrikes (LGS) for sex discrimination and {{as an indicator of}} individual quality. Our results suggest that the black tail patterns, especially spots on T 5, are important for sex discrimi-nation, but only in combination with other melanin-based or morphological features. The presence of black tail spots on T 5 is also an indicator of male age. However, {{there is no indication that}} presence, size and asymmetry of these black spots are indicators of indi-vidual quality of both sexes in the terms of breeding performances...|$|R
40|$|Many {{biological}} and artificial neural networks require the parallel extraction of multiple features, and meet this requirement with distinct populations of neurons that are selective to one {{property of the}} stimulus while being non-selective to another property. In this way, several populations can resolve a set of features independently of each other, and thus achieve a parallel mode of processing. This raises the question how an initially homogeneous population of neurons segregates into groups with distinct and complementary response properties. Using a colour image sequence recorded from a camera mounted {{on the head of}} a freely behaving cat, we train a network of neurons to achieve optimally stable responses, that is, responses that change minimally over time. This objective leads to the development of colour-selective neurons. Adding a second objective, decorrelating activity within the network, a subpopulation of neurons develops with <b>achromatic</b> response properties. <b>Colour</b> selective neurons tend to be non-oriented while achromatic neurons are orientation-tuned. The proposed objective thus successfully leads to the segregation of neurons into complementary populations that are either selective for colour or orientation...|$|R

Three experiments provided information about the colourimetric localization of the 11 Spanish BCCs. Two experiments used monolexemic naming tasks (free and restricted) and a third required the free signalling of prototypes and good exemplars. It was observed that Spanish and British BCCs are essentially equivalents in number and colourimetric delimitation and, therefore, our work can be considered to extend and complement previous research (on English BCCs) insofar as <b>achromatic</b> categories in <b>colour</b> space localization, the links between chromatic and achromatic categories (red and orange have no direct links with achromatic categories), and the dependence {{of the use of}} BCCs on lightness are concerned.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{algorithm}} for illumi-nant estimation. We begin by reviewing {{the concept of}} chro-magenic colour constancy, where two pictures are taken from each scene: a normal one and one where a coloured filter is {{placed in front of}} the camera, and look at param-eters known to affect its performance such as filters and sensor choice. We show that the basic formulation of the chromagenic algorithm has inherent weaknesses: a need for perfectly reg-istered images and occasional large errors in illuminant es-timation. Our first contribution is to analyse the algorithm performance with respect to the reflectances present in a scene and demonstrate that fairly bright and desaturated reflectances (e. g., <b>achromatic</b> and pastel <b>colours)</b> provide significantly better chromagenic illuminant estimation. This analysis leads to the bright-chromagenic algo-rithm. We show that it not only remedies the large error problem but also allows us to relax the image registration constraint. Experiments performed on a variety of syn-thetic and real data show that the newly designed bright-chromagenic algorithm significantly -in a strict statistical sense- outperforms current illuminant estimation methods, including those having a substantially higher complexity...|$|R
40|$|This review {{outlines}} how eyes {{of terrestrial}} vertebrates and insects meet the competing requirements of coding both spatial and spectral information. There is no unique {{solution to this}} problem. Thus, mammals and honeybees use their long-wavelength receptors for both <b>achromatic</b> (luminance) and <b>colour</b> vision, whereas flies and birds probably use separate sets of photoreceptors for the two purposes. In particular, we look at spectral tuning and diversification among `long-wavelength¿ receptors (sensitivity maxima at greater than 500 ¿nm), which play a primary role in luminance vision. Data on spectral sensitivities and phylogeny of visual photopigments {{can be incorporated into}} theoretical models to suggest how eyes are adapted to coding natural stimuli. Models indicate, for example, that animal colour vision¿involving five or fewer broadly tuned receptors¿is well matched to most natural spectra. We can also predict that the particular objects of interest and signal-to-noise ratios will affect the optimal eye design. Nonetheless, it remains difficult to account for the adaptive significance of features such as co-expression of photopigments in single receptors, variation in spectral sensitivities of mammalian L-cone pigments and the diversification of long-wavelength receptors that has occurred in several terrestrial lineages...|$|R
40|$|Synaesthesia {{is a rare}} {{phenomenon}} in which stimulation in one modality (e. g. audition) evokes a secondary percept not associated with the first (e. g. colour). Although {{there is a significant}} body of research investigating the mechanisms underlying synaesthetic experiences, it is only recently that studies have begun to investigate broader traits associated with the condition. Prior work has suggested links between synaesthesia and other neurodevelopmental conditions that are linked to altered social perception abilities. With this in mind, here we sought to examine social perception abilities in grapheme-colour synaesthesia (where <b>achromatic</b> graphemes evoke <b>colour</b> experiences) by examining facial identity and facial emotion perception in grapheme-colour synaesthetes and non-synaesthete controls. Our results indicate that individuals who experience grapheme-colour synaesthesia outperformed controls on tasks involving fine visual discrimination of facial identity and emotion, but not on tasks involving holistic face processing. These findings are discussed in the context of broader perceptual and cognitive traits previously associated with synaesthesia for colour, with the suggestion that performance benefits shown by grapheme-colour synaesthetes on fine visual discrimination of facial identity and emotion may be related to domain-general visual discrimination biases observed in this group...|$|R
40|$|The {{distinct}} behaviours {{of animals}} and the varied habitats in which animals live place different requirements on their visual systems. A trade-off exists between resolution and sensitivity, with these properties varying across the retina. Spectral sensitivity, which affects both <b>achromatic</b> and chromatic (<b>colour)</b> vision, also varies across the retina, though the function of this inhomogeneity is less clear. We previously demonstrated spatially varying spectral sensitivity of double cones in the cichlid fish Metriaclima zebra owing to coexpression of different opsins. Here, we map the distributions of ganglion cells and cone cells and quantify opsin coexpression in single cones to show these also vary across the retina. We identify an area centralis with peak acuity and infrequent coexpression, which may be suited for tasks such as foraging and detecting male signals. The peripheral retina has reduced ganglion cell densities and increased opsin coexpression. Modeling of cichlid visual tasks indicates that coexpression might hinder colour discrimination of foraging targets and some fish colours. But, coexpression might improve contrast detection of dark objects against bright backgrounds, which might be useful for detecting predators or zooplankton. This suggests a trade-off between acuity and colour discrimination in the central retina versus lower resolution but more sensitive contrast detection in the peripheral retina. Significant variation {{in the pattern of}} coexpression among individuals, however, raises interesting questions about the selective forces at work...|$|R

Moreover, diabetic retinopathy is becoming a dominant cause of visual impairment and blindness. The complex relation between cardiovascular disease and diabetic retinopathy {{as a function of}} ageing, obesity and hypertension remains to be clarified. Here, we investigated such relations in patients with diabetes type 2, in subjects with neither overt heart disease nor advanced proliferative diabetic retinopathy. We studied 47 patients and 50 controls, aged between 45 and 65 years, equally distributed according to gender. From the 36 measures regarding visual structure and function, and the 11 measures concerning left ventricle function, we performed data reduction to obtain eight new derived variables, seven of which related to the eye, adjusted for age, gender, body mass index and high blood pressure using both discriminant analysis (DA) and logistic regression (LR). We found moderate to strong correlation between left ventricle function and the eye constructs: minimum correlation was found for psychophysical motion thresholds (DA: 0. 734; LR: 0. 666), while the maximum correlation was achieved with structural volume density in the neural retina (DA: 0. 786; LR: 0. 788). Controlling the effect of pairwise correlated visual constructs, the parameters that were most correlated to left ventricle function were volume density in retina and thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layers (adjusted multiple R 2 is 0. 819 and 0. 730 for DA and LR), with additional contribution of <b>psychophysical</b> loss in <b>achromatic</b> contrast discrimination. We conclude that visual structural and functional changes in type 2 diabetes are related to heart dysfunction, when the effects of clinical, demographic and associated risk factors are taken into account, revealing a genuine relation between cardiac and retinal diabetic phenotypes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Plumage {{coloration}} {{is important}} for bird communication, most notably in sexual signalling. Colour is often considered a good quality indicator, and the expression of exaggerated colours may depend on individual condition during moult. After moult, plumage coloration has been deemed fixed {{due to the fact}} that feathers are dead structures. Still, many plumage colours change after moult, although whether this affects signalling has not been sufficiently assessed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We studied changes in coloration after moult in four passerine birds (robin, Erithacus rubecula; blackbird, Turdus merula; blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus; and great tit, Parus major) displaying various coloration types (melanin-, carotenoid-based and structural). Birds were caught regularly during three years to measure plumage reflectance. We used models of avian colour vision to derive two variables, one describing chromatic and the other achromatic variation over the year that can be compared in magnitude among different colour types. All studied plumage patches but one (yellow breast of the blue tit) showed significant chromatic changes over the year, although these were smaller than for a typical dynamic trait (bill colour). Overall, structural colours showed a reduction in relative reflectance at shorter wavelengths, carotenoid-based colours the opposite pattern, while no general pattern was found for melanin-based <b>colours.</b> <b>Achromatic</b> changes were also common, but there were no consistent patterns of change for the different types of colours. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Changes of plumage coloration independent of moult are probably widespread; they should be perceivable by birds and have the potential to affect colour signalling...|$|R

Theories range from those related to a magnocellular deficit, inattention, enhanced crowding and hyperactivity of sustained pathway processing (Dain et al., 2008; Roach and Hogben, 2008; Martelli et al., 2009; Laycock et al., 2012). However, much conflicting support for these theories exists. In this study, the relatively less intensively researched area, of peripheral visual sensory processing, of participants with RD was explored. All participants answered a vision questionnaire and performed the comparative rate of character recognition test (CREST) (Griffiths, personal communication). They were all assessed for optometric abnormalities. Subsequently, their spatiotemporal achromatic and chromatic contrast sensitivities (033) were measured. Gabor patches of varying spatial frequency (SF); 0. 3, 1 and 3 cycles per degree (cpd), and <b>colour</b> (<b>achromatic,</b> red-green and blue-yellow) were used. Achromatic and chromatic contrast thresholds were determined using a 2 -alternative forced choice procedure along a 3 -down, 1 -up staircase paradigm. Stimuli were presented centrally and 10 ° peripherally. Peripheral flicker achromatic (F(1, 19) = 4. 841, p = 0. 040), red-green (F(1, 19) = 6. 333, p = 0. 021) and blue-yellow (F(1, 19) = 5. 822, p = 0. 026) CSs were significantly attenuated in those with RD as calculated using ANOVA. Peripheral static achromatic CSs (F(1, 19) = 10. 120, p = 0. 005) and central flicker blue-yellow CSs (F(1, 19) = 5. 815, p = 0. 026) were similarly reduced. Peripheral static red-green (F(1, 19) = 3. 211, p 0. 089) and blue-yellow CSs (F(1, 19) = 4. 287, p = 0. 052) were significantly reduced if using a less stringent significance level of 0. 1. A significant interaction between reading difficulty and retinal eccentricity was found in an overall ANOVA, F(1, 19), p< 0. 05. The general {{finding of this study}} was a peripheral vision defect in those with RD. A peripheral vision deficit may align the conflicting evidence of visual sensory deficits in RD...|$|R
40|$|Different Degrees of Naturalness of Quantifiers and Colour Terms In his “Remarks on Colour” (1977 : III- 46), Ludwig Wittgenstein writes: “Among the colours: Kinship and Contrast. (And that is logic). ” In {{this talk}} on quantifiers, colour percepts and colour concepts, proof will be {{provided}} that Wittgenstein’s intuition about the logical nature of colour relations {{has to be taken}} literally. Relations of opposition between primary and secondary chromatic percepts will be shown algebraically to be the same as those between the three primary items (all, some, none) in the lexical class of quantifiers and their contradictories. An important area where evidence can be found for this intriguing case of homology is that of lexicalisation asymmetries between different kinds of colour terms and different types of quantifiers. On the one extreme, certain lexicalisations are nonexistent and arguably cognitively nonnatural, such as Horn’s (1989) O-corner quantifier *nall and chromatic nonce-formations such as *reen (= “reddish green”), while {{at the other end of}} the lexicalisation spectre there are items which are fully natural ordinary language terms (all, white, etc.), universally lexicalised by what will be identified as innate conceptual pressure. In between those two extremes, so it will be argued, there is a middle category with differences in lexicalisability. Items in this category, including such specialised terms as nand in logic and such nonbasic colour terms as cyan or magenta, reveal that differences in utility determine whether such items are lexicalised or not. Take the example of nand, which is an established term in the context of electronic circuits in engineering but unattested in everyday natural language. In principle, all types of logic gates (OR, AND, etc.) could be created equally as well from a network of NOR gates as from a NAND gate network. Yet the latter carried the day because the available technology made it easier to implement than a NOR gate network. It is for this extra-linguistic reason that the language of science successfully adopted the useful electronic engineering term “nand”, which has nonetheless remained equally as nonnatural in the natural logic of ordinary language as before. Thus, no natural language has structures such as (the equivalent of) *John nand Bill ate a piece of cake, meaning “either John, or Bill, or neither of them ate a piece of cake”. Let us first describe the nature of the isomorphism postulated between quantifier and colour oppositions in more detail and then distil the different degrees of naturalness of lexicalisations from the two isomorphic models, with a special focus on the in-between category where utility helps overcome cognitive nonnaturalness for usage within a more restricted domain of application. This is a distinction reminiscent of the technical vs. natural-approximative opposition between more than half and (one of the meanings of) most. The most straightforward historical starting point for a comparison of chromatic and predicate logical oppositions is the colour wheel on the one hand and the Aristotelian-Boethian logical square of oppositions on the other. Since the colour wheel and the square have different geometries, however, more converging models have to be called upon. On the logical side, the model in question is a logical hexagon based on work by Blanché (1953, 1969). This hexagon is in fact a bitriangle, which is derived by adding to an AYE-triangle of contraries (A: all; Y: some, but not all; E: no(ne)) its dual IOU (I: some or all; O: some or none; U: all or no), i. e. a triangle of subcontrary relations (Moretti 2009, 142). Algebraic definitions for the logical oppositions in this Blanché-star – i. e. for entailment (arrows), contradiction (red lines), contrariety (blue lines) and subcontrariety (green lines) – carry over to the realm of colour percepts, which can be mapped onto the same hexagon. Let us see how. In view of Thomas Young’s trichromatic theory of colour vision and its later refinements, the triangle of contraries will be shown to involve the primary colours red-green-blue. Experiential associations of blue with dark and cold (negative) versus yellow with light and warm (positive) and red with warmest, but also subject-independent asymmetries such as wavelength properties will provide arguments to link LW red with the A-corner, MW green with the Y-corner and SW blue with the negative E-corner. The other three colours in the star are secondary and composite: at the physical and perceptual level they represent the combined wavelengths – in set-theoretical terms: the union of the wavelengths – of green and red (= yellow), green and blue (= cyan) and red and blue (= magenta) respectively. As is known from the phenomenon of afterimages and from insights in Hering’s opponent process theory, the secondary triad yellow-cyan-magenta consists of complementaries of the primary colours, a type of opposition that is the colour equivalent of contradictoriness in the logical square (and hexagon) of oppositions. Thus, two quantifiers (e. g. no and some, maybe all) are contradictories if the intersection of their denotations is the null set and the union the universe; correspondingly, two colour percepts (e. g. blue and yellow) are complementaries if the intersection of the wavelengths (or activated cone types) involved is the null set – yielding a black percept – and the union is the universe of wavelengths (or cone activation), i. e. white. Returning to the issue of the different degrees of naturalness of lexicalisations, two facts stand out in the stars. First of all, the operators that resist natural single-item lexicalization in logic (O-corner not all, for which there is no natural lexicalization *nall and U-corner all or no, for which there is no *allno) have counterparts in the realm of colour terms which are not naturally lexicalized either, in casu O-corner cyan and U-corner magenta, cognitively dyadic and less natural than red, green, blue, yellow. Yet, although in both stars the occupants of the relevant corners are nonnatural, there is a marked difference. The occupants do exist as specialised terms in the colour star, whereas they are completely absent in the case of the quantifiers. This is attributable to the difference in nature between colour percepts and logical concepts. While the former are cone activation patterns reflexively generated by the vision system, the latter involve more abstract entities. That the lexicalisation difference is due to this difference is reinforced by the fact that the colour star has to be expanded to accommodate the two <b>achromatic</b> <b>colours</b> black and white. These two correspond to neither all, nor some, nor no (whose denotation is the null set) and some or all or no (the universe) respectively in the predicate logical system. While the two logical operators involved are trivial and hence useless for any contingency, the null set of cone activation in the colour system does generate a functional colour percept (black), which is not a useless or noninformative representation at all. In sum, the natural language lexicon contains at least a quantificational but probably a wider range of closed lexical fields (kinship terms, person, numerals) susceptible to a decompositional analysis in terms of the system of oppositions that characterizes colour percept discrimination. The nature of the opposition system results in a distinction between cognitively natural and nonnatural lexical items, the latter of which can only make it into specialised language, and then only in those cases where their adoption is facilitated by extra-linguistic utility.

40|$|Light {{modelling}} is a {{small but}} {{important part of the}} lighting quality concept. It determines not only the capability of the eye to detect any objects in a space but also its ability to discriminate contours, shapes and details, the most important visual characteristics of any object. These are essential and significant indicators that allow a person to analyse and ascertain another person’s state of health, the freshness of food, the mood of the interlocutor and many other key characteristics of visual environments. Thus, light modelling is an essential aspect important in various architectural spaces, from museums to hospitals to offices. To date, few studies have been dedicated to light modelling. Some basic knowledge has been achieved from studies on pedestrian visibility and road lighting. However, few investigations have been performed in day-lit interiors. Thus, the light modelling topic remains underestimated and insufficiently studied. To address this gap, the present research aims to develop the concept of light modelling of real 3 D objects in day-lit environments. The author will propose the metrics of contour, shape and details distinctness of the examined units as the most critical aspects of light modelling. Based on the idea that light and colour are mentally inseparable in the human perception of visual environments, it is of great importance to create experimental conditions that provide both of these principal concepts (light and colour). The high dynamic range (HDR) imaging technique will be used as part of the experimental research methodology, giving reliable, analysable, numerical data obtained from luminance maps. Three experiments and their outcomes form the basis of this dissertation. Work on this dissertation began with general research questions regarding studies of chromatic interiors using HDR images, examining the possible effect of <b>achromatic</b> and chromatic <b>colours</b> and colour combinations on the perception of room illumination (Experiment 1). The focus then turned {{to the development of the}} appropriate luminance-based metrics of real 3 D achromatic and chromatic objects placed in a room illuminated by daylight (Experiment 2). These metrics were then verified in a real room study and repeated through computer simulation (Experiment 3). The results obtained from these experiments indicate that majority of the proposed luminance-based metrics correlate very well with subjective assessments that deem contour, shape and details to be distinguishable in different degrees. The metrics also indicate considerable variations among 3 D objects with different luminance and chromatic contrasts. These luminance-based metrics outperformed currently used modelling index and cylindrical illuminance metrics. Furthermore, these luminance-based metrics can be used both in real architectural spaces and computer simulations. Considering these advantages, the author of this dissertation proposes that luminance-based metrics should be recommended for practical use to ensure light modelling; specifically, to better guarantee the distinctness of objects’ contours, shapes and details. The metrics have some limitations dictated by existing experimental conditions and therefore require further testing if they are to be made universally applicable. These will be further discussed in the present dissertation, as will some proposals for possible future research...|$|R
40|$|In monkey visual cortex, colour {{information}} is primarily processed in the ventral pathway through areas V 1, V 2, and V 4 into the inferior temporal (IT) cortex. Recent {{studies have shown}} that the IT cortex, which is situated at the final processing stage of the ventral visual pathway, plays an important role in colour processing. Single cell recording {{studies have shown that}} there are numerous colour-selective neurons in the IT cortex, some of which are narrowly tuned to hues and/or saturations and exhibit task-related responses during colour discrimination. In addition, lesion studies have shown that bilateral ablation of the IT cortex disrupts colour discrimination, though ablation of V 4 does not. Although many colour-selective neurons have been found in the IT cortex, their distribution in this cortical region remains not fully clear, especially in the anterior part of the IT cortex. In the present study, we explored the distribution of colour-selective activity in the IT cortex using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in alert macaque monkeys. 　　　As exploratory examinations, we have measured retinotopic organization, motion-selective activity and shape-selective activity of the visual cortex. The retinotopic organization was obtained by comparing responses to the horizontal meridian and vertical meridian stimuli and was helpful in determining the boundaries of visual areas. The motion-selective activity was obtained by contrasting response to moving random-dot stimuli with that to static random-dot stimuli and used to determine the physiological isoluminance point of colour grating. The shape-selective activity was obtained by contrasting responses to object image stimuli and scrambled image stimuli. The distribution of the shape-selective activity was later compared with that of the colour-selective activity. These exploratory experiments were required for analyzing the results in the main experiment. 　　　In the main experiments, we examined colour-selective activity in the IT cortex with two types of stimuli: an isoluminant colour grating and a multicoloured (‘Mondrian’) pattern that have been commonly employed in human fMRI and have identified colour-selective areas/regions in the fusiform gyrus, which is suggested to correspond to the monkey IT cortex. The paradigm using gratings is to compare responses to an isoluminant, colour-varying grating (e. g. a red-blue grating) with responses to a luminance-varying grating. This paradigm identified colour-selective regions in the posterior part of the human fusiform gyrus that is called V 8 /VO. The paradigm using Mondrian is to compare responses to a multicoloured (‘Mondrian’) pattern with responses to its achromatic counterpart. This paradigm identified colour-selective regions in the more anterior part of the fusiform gyrus, in addition to the posterior part. Earlier imaging studies of the monkey IT cortex used only the first paradigm, but the second paradigm may elicit more effectively the colour-selective activity in the anterior IT according to the findings in human fMRI. Moreover, Mondrian stimuli may be more suitable for activating higher areas, since the stimuli containing various hues could elicit responses from many neurons, each tuned to a specific hue. For that reason, we have used both grating and Mondrian stimuli to examine colour-selective activity in the IT cortex. As a result, we found that colour-selectivity is not uniformly distributed in the IT cortex, but is clustered in discrete subregions that are located in the posterior and the anterior part of the IT cortex. The colour-selective activity in the posterior IT was obtained both with the grating and Mondrian stimuli, but the positions of the activity were different dependent on the stimuli. On the other hand, the colour-selective activity in the anterior IT was obtained only with the Mondrian stimuli. 　　　We have examined whether these topographical differences of colour-selective activity depending on the stimuli were attributable to the difference in the luminance contrast between the chromatic Mondrian stimuli and colour grating stimuli: although the luminance contrast in the chromatic Mondrian stimulus matched that in the <b>achromatic</b> Mondrian, the <b>colour</b> grating stimulus contained much smaller amount of luminance contrast than the luminance grating. To examine the possible influence of the luminance contrast in the chromatic Mondrian stimuli, we employed isoluminant Mondrian stimuli that contained much less luminance contrast than the achromatic ones, and compared the distributions of colour-selective activity obtained with this isolumiant Mondrian, the Mondrian containing matched luminance contrast and the isoluminant grating. The results have shown that the topography of the colour-selective activity obtained with the isoluminant Mondrian was very similar to that obtained with the Mondrian containing matched luminance contrast whereas it was very different from that obtained with the isoluminant grating. This indicates that the difference in the distribution of the responses to the Mondrian and grating stimuli in the IT cortex cannot be attributed solely to the difference in luminance contrast. 　　　We finally compared the distribution of colour-selective activity with that of shape-selective activity in the IT cortex. We found that the colour- and shape-selective activity tends to overlap little in the anterior IT whereas the colour-selective activity in the posterior IT and early visual areas overlapped with the shape-selective activity. This finding was consistent with the results of previous electrophysiological recording experiments comparing the responses of neurons to colour and shape stimuli and suggests that colour and shape information is clustered in different modules specifically tuned to each attribute. The present study shows that colour-selective activity is clustered in discrete regions of the monkey IT cortex and that these colour-selective regions are distributed in both the anterior and posterior IT. The difference in the response properties and the retinotopy suggests that these regions may correspond to different spots of colour-selective activity reported in the human fusiform gyrus: the colour-selective activity in the posterior IT may correspond to V 8 /VO which is in the posterior part of the fusiform gyrus, and colour-selective activity in the anterior IT may correspond to V 4 α and regions in the more anterior part of the fusiform gyrus...|$|R
