50|$|The AEGs were {{developed}} in Japan and the Japanese company Tokyo Marui is credited with creating the original gearbox system. In a Tokyo Marui AEG, the motor drives a train of 3 gears mounted inside a gearbox, which then loads a <b>pump</b> <b>piston</b> against a spring. Once the spring is released, it pushes the piston plunger forward through the pump cylinder to propel a pellet resting within the chamber forward through the barrel {{and out of the}} muzzle.

50|$|The Jumo 210G had {{a direct}} {{injection}} system developed by August Lichte. The Jumo system used a small <b>pump</b> <b>piston</b> positioned beside each of the main cylinders, driven off the crank shaft. The injector used a simple check valve to prevent internal pressure from blowing back into the fuel line, and the pump was timed to inject at the proper point in the intake cycle. Inclusion of the injection system increased takeoff performance by about 20 PS without increasing boost rates and it also reduced fuel consumption. For those reasons most newer German engine types were set up with fuel injection systems. The Jumo 210G was rated at 730 PS (720 hp, 534 kW) and was only available for fast aircraft like the Bf 109 and Bf 110 but not for slow aircraft like the Ju 87.|$|E
5000|$|Inductive pumps {{use both}} sides of the piston to pump and suction simultaneously. This means that {{both sides of}} the <b>pump</b> <b>piston</b> are always {{experiencing}} the inlet pressure at a minimum until the pressure cycle that would exceed the inlet pressure. This may be interpreted as meaning the net head pressure in a close circuit, {{at the beginning of a}} stroke cycle, is always zero. Therefore, inductive pumps may be used in very high pressure closed circuits to circulate liquids at very low differential pressures. Essentially the inductive pump does not have to overcome the closed system pressure in order to move liquid in the system. This results in far less use of energy to move liquid with the circuit. This also provides additional circulation without any dynamic seals that could eventually leek to the outside of the system.|$|E
50|$|There {{are very}} few {{mechanical}} losses compared to piston pumps and other technologies {{because there are no}} mechanical linkages to the piston from outside power sources. The inductive <b>pump</b> <b>piston</b> is driven directly by the magnetic field formed within the body structure about the bore and within the piston. There are minimal friction losses between the piston and bore due to a circumferential magnetic field that pulls the piston equally in all directions towards the wall of the bore. The resulting force is more axial along the path of the piston creating output pressure. Most other pumps use different types of gear reduction mechanisms to slow the rotation of the motor down when driving the piston. These linkages result in significant energy losses in addition to the inefficiencies of the motor. Inductive pumps use various proprietary coatings to reduce friction drag and increase efficiency. Specific models of inductive pumps incorporate a seal less ceramic interface with matching ceramic bore and piston interfaces ground to close tolerances that do not require use of elastic seals. Ceramic interfaces are inert to extremely caustic acids, alkalis, and solvents used industrially.|$|E
50|$|A radial <b>piston</b> <b>pump</b> {{is a form}} of {{hydraulic}} <b>pump.</b> The working <b>pistons</b> extend in a {{radial direction}} symmetrically around the drive shaft, in contrast to the axial <b>piston</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R

5000|$|An axial <b>piston</b> <b>pump</b> has {{a number}} of pistons (usually an odd number) {{arranged}} in a circular array within a housing which is commonly referred to as a cylinder block, rotor or barrel. This cylinder block is driven to rotate about its axis of symmetry by an integral shaft that is, more or less, aligned with the <b>pumping</b> <b>pistons</b> (usually parallel but not necessarily).|$|R
5000|$|Spring-piston air guns (or simply [...] "spring guns" [...] or [...] "springers") operate {{by means}} of a coil {{spring-loaded}} piston pump assembly contained within a compression chamber separate from the gun barrel. Before shooting, the user need to manually cock the gun by flexing a lever connected to the pump assembly. The cocking causes the <b>pump</b> <b>piston</b> to move backwards and compress the spring until its rear engages the sear. The act of pulling the trigger disengages the sear, allows the spring to decompress and release the elastic potential energy stored within it, and pushes the piston forward thereby compressing the air in the pump cylinder. Because the pump outlet (located {{to the front of the}} pump) is directly behind the pellet sitting in the barrel chamber, once the air pressure has risen enough to overcome any static friction and/or barrel restriction holding back the pellet, the pellet is propelled forward by an expanding column of pressurized air. All this takes place in a fraction of a second, during which the air undergoes adiabatic heating to several hundred degrees and then cools as the air expands. This can also cause a phenomenon referred as [...] "dieseling", where flammable substances in the compression chamber (e.g. petroleum-based lubricant) can be ignited by the heat generated, and lead to combustion smoke coming out of the muzzle upon firing.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to measure the pressures generated by two commercially available pumps (CADD PIB, Smiths and Gemstar, Hospira) when delivering PIEB or CEI at 2 commonly used rates of infusion (10 or 5 mL). The two pumps were set to deliver fluid at four rates (CEI: 5 or 10 mL/h; PIEB: 5 or 10 mL every h) and connected to a pressure transducer (PCB Piezotronics 1500 connected to a NI USB- 6251 Screw Terminal) to determine the pressures applied during each infusion. The peak pressure generated dur ing the PIEB mode was consistently higher when compared to the CEI mode in both pumps. When comparing the two pumps in the PIEB 10 mL every hour mode, the peak pressures were approximately the same, while the pressure pattern differed. For each cycle the pressure generated by Gemstar oscillated from 25 mmHg to 0 mmHg; whereas with the CADD pump the baseline pressure was above 0. The Gemstar <b>pump</b> <b>piston</b> frequency (1. 2 Hz) was twice as high as the CADD (0. 5 Hz), so the volume delivered per cycle was lower.

40|$|AbstractDesalination of {{groundwater}} {{is essential in}} arid regions that are remote from both seawater and freshwater resources. Desirable features of a groundwater desalination system include a high recovery ratio, operation from a sustainable energy source such as solar, and high water output per unit of energy and land. Here we propose a new system that uses a solar-Rankine cycle to drive reverse osmosis (RO). The working fluid such as steam is expanded against a power piston that actuates a <b>pump</b> <b>piston</b> which in turn pressurises the saline water thus passing it through RO membranes. A reciprocating crank mechanism is used to equalise the forces between the two pistons. The choice of batch mode in preference to continuous flow permits maximum energy recovery and minimal concentration polarisation {{in the vicinity of}} the RO membrane. This study analyses the sizing and efficiency of the crank mechanism, quantifies energy losses in the RO separation and predicts the overall performance. For example, a system using a field of linear Fresnel collectors occupying 1000 m 2 of land and raising steam at 200 °C and 15. 5 bar could desalinate 350 m 3 /day from saline water containing 5000 ppm of sodium chloride with a recovery ratio of 0. 7...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a {{pressure}} transmitter using a modified op-amp based network for inductance measurement using a bellow as sensor {{has been proposed}} to measure the pressure and to convert pressure changes in to an electrical current which can be transmitted to a remote indicator. The change in inductance due to change in pressure is measured by an improved modified operational amplifier based network. The proposed network permits offset inductance compensation of sensing coil and also minimizes the stray capacitance between sensing coil and ground using dummy inductor whose value equal to zero level inductance of sensing coil and op-amps with high input impedance. In {{the first part of}} experiment, a modified op-amp based inductance measuring circuit has been simulated using LabVIEW (Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench) and studied with test inductance, and in the second part, the experimentation was done by replacing the test inductance with a sensing coil fitted to bellow by means of ferromagnetic wire for the measurement of pressure. It has been observed that the variation in gauge pressure from 0 to 70 psi having linear relationship with output ac voltage in the range of 0 to 85. 0 mV.

40|$|The {{upper part}} of the figure depicts an {{actuator}} that comprises two mechanically biased piezoelectric benders hinged together at their ends and equipped with tabs at their mid-length points for attachment to the relatively moving objects that are to be actuated. In the example of the figure, the attachment tabs are labeled to indicate that the actuator is used to drive a <b>pump</b> <b>piston</b> relative to a base plate. Actuators of this type could be used to drive low-power, small-volume pumps in consumer, medical, and aerospace applications, and to generate and measure linear displacements in such robotic applications as teleoperation and tactile feedback. Each bender is a bimorph a unitary plate that comprises an upper and a lower piezoelectric layer plus electrode layers. Benders may also be made of several layers arranged to produce the same effect at the lower operating voltages. As stated above, each bender is mechanically biased; it is fabricated to have a small permanent curvature (the bias curvature) in the absence of applied voltage. As on other bimorphs, the electrical connections on each bender are arranged so that an applied voltage of suitable polarity causes the upper layer to expand and the lower layer to contract. In this case, the net effect of applying the voltage is that the plate becomes more concave as viewed from below. Conversely, an applied voltage of the opposite polarity causes the plate to become less concave as viewed from below. The benders in a hinged pair are oriented with their bias curvatures concave inward, so that there is a bias distance between the attachment tabs. The two benders are connected electrically in parallel, with their connection polarities chosen so that an applied voltage of one polarity causes both benders to become more convex inward (more bent), while an applied voltage of the opposite polarity causes both benders to become less convex inward (less bent). An increase or decrease in bend is accompanied by an increase or decrease in distance between the attachment tabs; this increase or decrease is the linear displacement desired for actuation. Because the displacement can be either positive or negative relative to the bias distance, depending on the polarity of the applied voltage, the overall stroke achievable for a given magnitude of applied voltage is double the stroke achievable in the absence of mechanical bias. Each hinged pair can be regarded as a unit cell that can serve as a building block for a larger actuator: Multiple unit cells can be stacked (mechanically connected in series), as shown in {{the lower part of the}} figure, and electrically connected in parallel to multiply the overall stroke achievable at a given applied voltage...|$|E
