40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} Community Writing and Education Station (CWEST), a community engagement project that partners a community adult basic literacy {{program with a}} university writing lab. The author argues that the community and university partners, the Lafayette Adult Resource Academy (LARA) and the Purdue Writing Lab, offer positive opportunities for sustainable, mutually beneficial, and collaborative engagement because they are well established and have complementary missions. The main products of the partnership are instructional resources tailored {{to the needs and}} learning styles of adult basic education students and published on the <b>Purdue</b> <b>Online</b> <b>Writing</b> <b>Lab</b> (OWL). The author argues that the Purdue OWL offers a unique space for community engagement that allows for the production of public rhetoric, sustainability, and revision through empirical research. The research uses case studies of four LARA instructors to investigate LARA’s pedagogical and administrative characteristics and how the instructional materials created during the engagement project support those characteristics. Teaching observations and interviews were used during each case study, and focus groups and artifact collection were also used to investigate the research questions. The author describes the process of using research findings to revise the materials, thus providing a model of community engagement that is informed by community-based research. The dissertation concludes with recommendations for writing centers and writing programs interested in this model of community engagement. ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{academic}} {{writing and}} learning centres {{around the world}} are concerned about the entry-level academic writing skills of undergraduate students. The aim of our research is to develop effective tutoring sessions for at-risk students at the start of their first year at the university. These students are selected by a valid and reliable academic literacy test that shows a significant correlation with academic achievement (De Wachter et al. 2013). In the short presentation we will discuss the effect measurement of three intensive writing workshops. The workshops are part of a coaching programme following the language test and focus on writing strategy development through methods such as observational learning and collaborative writing (De Wachter & Heeren 2012; Graham & Perrin 2007). Both a qualitative and a quantitative study have been carried out to measure the effectiveness of the intervention. Each year, students receive a questionnaire to evaluate different aspects of the workshops. Next to that, the quality of students' texts is measured through a one group, pretest-posttest design. Two experienced raters assess the texts on two lower order concerns (LOCs) : ‘spelling and grammar’ and ‘sentence structure’ and three higher order concerns (HOCs) ‘text coherence’, ‘paragraph structure’ and ‘scientific style’. The categories originated out of a series of needs analyses (De Wachter & Heeren, 2011; Berckmoes & Rombouts, 2009; Bonset, 2010); the division into HOCs and LOCs is based on that of the <b>Purdue</b> <b>Online</b> <b>Writing</b> <b>Lab.</b> The questionnaires indicate that the majority of students perceive the workshops as useful for their writing practice. The preliminary results of the quantitative study show that the 32 students that followed all three workshops, significantly improved on the HOCs: text coherence, paragraph structure and academic style. There are no significant changes in spelling, grammar or sentence structure. We will show that writing research is an essential tool to constantly assess and improve existing writing programmes so that they meet the actual needs of a defined target audience and have the intended effect. Furthermore, we would also like to discuss the problems and limitations that are intrinsically part of any effect measurement in a classroom-based environment. status: accepte...|$|E

This article offers four stakeholder perspectives on the process of participatory technology design: of writing center administrators, graduate students, technical writing practitioners, and writing program graduate faculty members. The model asserted by this article presents a dynamic understanding of expertise and of fluidity in the roles of participants.

40|$|Technology succeeds pedagogically when it supports, enhances, or {{otherwise}} extends {{the social fabric}} of a community; it fails, proves unsustainable, when it violates the expectations, rules, or needs of that community. Perhaps {{because they are so}} invested in the notion of social networks, writing centers have much to teach us about the appropriate uses of technology. Writing center theory and practice—with its emphasis on writing (and learning) as process and on knowledge as a collaborative construction—can shed much light upon constraints under which a balanced, sustainable technological ecology might operate. In this chapter, we discuss our experiences with distance-education systems, coursemanagement interfaces, <b>online</b> <b>writing</b> <b>labs,</b> and various other technologies utilized within writing centers.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of students entering college lack the academic skills necessary to perform well at the college level, forcing professors and academic institutions to lower standards. Students approach higher education as a commodity, and as consumers they assert their desire for easier course work by giving poor evaluations to instructors whose courses they find too demanding or difficult. Eliminating student evaluations is one necessary change that will help reverse declining standards in higher education and increase performance; providing effective venues for supplemental instruction is another. Teaching basic writing skills in freshman composition courses would waste valuable instruction time that must be spent on higher-order concerns, such as critical thinking, abstract reasoning, essay development, and research skills. <b>Online</b> <b>writing</b> <b>labs</b> offer lower-order instruction in grammar, punctuation, syntax, and style for students at any level, as do the learning programs that accompany composition textbooks and handbooks, yet these resources are under-utilized by students who need the most help.

40|$|It is {{increasingly}} recognised that university students benefit from explicit {{teaching in the}} modes and conventions of scholarly writing. It {{is also clear that}} academics require support in cascading the teaching of writing into modules and degree courses. The Coventry <b>Online</b> <b>Writing</b> <b>Lab</b> (COWL) Project has enabled the creation of an <b>online</b> <b>writing</b> centre component to enhance and extend the work of the Centre for Academic Writing (CAW) at Coventry University. Since 2004, CAW has utilised a highly successful face-to-face writing consultation model with students and staff. The challenges for CAW, as for all writing centres and writing support programmes, were that this provision was not scalable and that it was not accessible to distance-learners or to staff working remotely. The construction of CAW‘s <b>online</b> <b>writing</b> centre, COWL, has enabled the development of a seamless teaching and learning environment cross-housed on the CAW website and on the University‘s e-learning platform (Moodle). As COWL is rolled out for use across the institution, the goal is for academics to be able to utilise the COWL environment with their students as well as for students to book and engage in <b>online</b> <b>writing</b> tutorials with Academic Writing Tutors at CAW. The overall achievements of the COWL Project have been to appraise the provision of <b>online</b> <b>writing</b> tutoring in UK universities and elsewhere and to develop an integrated platform of technologically-enhanced writing support mechanisms, trialled at Coventry University and made available for use and further evaluation at other Higher Education institutions...|$|R

40|$|This project {{addresses}} two questions: (1) To {{what extent}} might networked computer technologies affect existing writing center practices? and (2) How can one make informed choices about implementing such technologies? It addresses these two questions {{through a combination}} of theoretical inquiry and qualitative research. Specifically, instrumental and substantive theories of technology are implicated in current discussions of networked computers and writing center practice, and the project argues for the value of critical theory as an alternative theoretical framework that enables those who work in writing centers to critique networked computers while envisioning future uses and designs. Important principles for writing center instruction are defined, principles such as individualized instruction, negotiation and dialogue, and minimal risk. The project argues that those principles should be embodied in the computer technologies that writing centers adopt. In order to ensure that such principles may be embodied in technologies adapted for writing center instruction, a set of strategies for their critique and design are defined, a set of strategies that includes both diachronic (historical) and synchronic (contemporary) critiques. A number of principles for the development and adaptation of networked computers are also defined. Specifically, the project argues that design efforts must include a variety of voices, including those of students, tutors, teachers, and administrators. Many of those strategies and principles are illustrated in a study of Purdue 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Online</b> <b>Writing</b> <b>Lab</b> (OWL). This set of strategies and principles offers a theoretically informed set of guidelines for the implementation of networked computer technologies in writing centers in particular and for writing instruction in general. Therefore, the project should be of particular interest to writing center administrators and tutors who are using, or who are planning to incorporate, networked computers in their writing centers. It also should interest writing instructors and writing program administrators who view networked computers {{as an integral part of}} writing instruction. ...|$|R

Critics have often accused distance learning of lacking coherent theory. Although distance education has drawn from fields such as instructional technology and psychology, few distinctive theories have emerged from such research. One major area that has garnered attention is interactivity in online course design. How can online learning be designed to foster as much interactive learning as possible for the instructor and student? Examining the learning situation more abstractly could aid designers in creating more interactive online environments. One area that represents the need for theory development is <b>Online</b> <b>Writing</b> <b>Lab</b> (OWL) pedagogy. Establishing the theoretical basis of the OWL is crucial in order to make improvements on the microlevel. As of 2006, OWL research relied less on consistent, multidisciplinary theory and more on composition theory and pedagogy only. In addition, then-current research did not address interactivity among students and tutors. Finally, only basic procedural models existed for OWL design, not learning theories from which to construct research. This study proposes a comprehensive theory and tri-level model for OWLs, drawing primarily from learning-to-learn and e-learning theories. In order to fully deconstruct OWLs and allow for various perspectives, poststructuralism and Thomas Kuhn's paradigm shift theory serve as the conceptual frameworks for the study. Because reconceptualizing OWLs at the theoretical level requires a paradigm shift, Robert Heinich's theoretical dissertation on systems theory and instructional technology, Technology and the Management of Instruction, serves as the model for the study. After exploring how the various fields relate to OWLs, this study demonstrates how these theories relate to present OWL scholarship. Current OWL research and design is analyzed according to the tenets of learning-to-learn and e-learning. The proposed theory and model are tested with focus/Delphi groups consisting of OWL administrators for validation and revision. Finally, the researcher discusses how this proposed theory and model can aid in constructing OWLs as interactive learning spaces. General guidelines for designing a fully interactive OWL are established...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of writing ability cannot be overstated, be it {{writing in the}} first or second language. Yet, students' lack of writing skills remains a constant complaint, especially in the contexts of English as a second language (ESL). In the quest for an intervening mechanism, Writing Centers (WCs) and <b>Online</b> <b>Writing</b> <b>Labs</b> (OWL), originating in North America, have proved effective. The success of Writing Centers seems to lie in their pedagogical approach of "improve the writer, not the writing" and the practice of non-directive and non-judgemental individualised student-centered one-on-one tutoring. This, then, motivated the present research to focus on the applications of WCs and OWLs in ESL tertiary education. The main research question examined is: in what ways are the theory and praxis of the WC and OWL applicable to ESL tertiary contexts of Malaysia? In establishing the applicability of WCs and OWLs to ESL tertiary students in Malaysia, this study conducts a series of thematic investigations on WCs and OWLs in North America, ESL students and writing in English for Academic Purposes and innovations in tertiary education, a case study on the status of English in Malaysia, and a survey on the writing needs and writing support in English at a Malaysian university. A comparison is also made among North American, European and Asian WCs and OWLs. The five investigations culminate in the formulation of a conceptual framework for the ESL WC approach and an action plan to implement the approach. The essence of the WC approach is in the application of writing centers as writing pedagogy, learner support and immersive language learning environments. The present research contributes towards the critical development and application of WCs and OWLs in universities in the Asian region where English functions as a second or foreign language. The initiative is also a pioneer innovation study in the field of WCs and OWLs for its application in Malaysian universities. Hence the study may contribute toward improved writing instruction, a new and comprehensive learner support system in the proposed WC framework, and the relevance of an immersive language learning environment...|$|R

5000|$|Media theory {{focuses on}} the agency that {{composing}} in new media can give writers. It {{is important not to}} simply add in new media as a problematic addendum to analogue writing; instead, teachers can take advantage of these [...] "new" [...] means by calling students to become both consumers or critics of new media as well as producers, as technology's role in society becomes ever more prominent. Giving students the resources to take part in discourses around and through new media gives them the power and agency to act in this digital world. The agency gained through new media composition also provides a basis for social change. Gunther Kress remarks on the potential for teaching design via new media composition in the classroom:Design takes for granted competence in the use of resources, but beyond that it requires the orchestration and remaking of these resources in the services of frameworks and models that express the maker's intentions in shaping the social and cultural environment. While critique looks at the present through the means of past production, design shapes the future through deliberate deployment of representational resources in the designer's interest. Teachers cite the ease of which students pick up on the techniques of composition and analysis of new media. The visually saturated and technologically heavy society of today means that students and writers will need to question the communications and compositions around them as rhetorical moves integral to the culture students live in. [...] Their familiarity with and knowledge of new media often results in positive, conscious appropriation of media, and opens the door for discussions of repurposing within culture. Jay Bolter and Richard Grusin say:No medium today, and certainly no single media event, seems to do its cultural work in isolation from other social and economic forces. What is new about new media comes from the particular ways in which they refashion older media {{and the ways in which}} older media refashion themselves to answer the challenges of new media. One potentially useful method of teaching composition with media theory in mind is through the use of online classrooms. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and <b>Online</b> <b>Writing</b> <b>Labs</b> (OWLs) are becoming increasingly popular, especially with distance learning. These educational formats also typically deal with analogue texts, but provide technologically based resources for this composition process via digital feedback and revision techniques. Media theory has particular potential for teaching basic writers or students whose native language is not English. As a [...] "literacy" [...] that [...] "translates" [...] better across languages and demographics, new media can serve to engage students who were previously uninterested in composition, as well as allow these students to feel like they have more expertise or agency in the composing process. Furthermore, it allows for more creativity and exploration of rhetorical power in composition as students learn the semiotic power of various modes of discourse through technology.|$|R
