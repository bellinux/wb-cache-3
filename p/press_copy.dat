25|$|Although {{saved from}} fire, the Declaration of Independence did suffer {{in years to}} come from the unanticipated ill effects of {{exposure}} and handling. Perhaps the most destructive action occurred in 1823 when the document was used to make a <b>press</b> <b>copy</b> as a master for making facsimile copies to distribute to members of Congress, governors, the Supreme Court and others including the three surviving signers—John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and John Carroll. As a result of pressing, {{a large portion of the}} ink was lifted from the document. Over the years, rolling and folding of the document creased and broke the parchment, and constant exposure to strong sunlight led to fading of the signatures to the extent that some could not be read.|$|E

6000|$|Two {{annotated}} {{copies of}} the genuine Fourth Edition of English Bards, etc. [1811], with MS. corrections in Byron's handwriting, are extant--one in Mr. Murray's possession, and a second in the Forster Library at the South Kensington Museum. The former, which contains the marginal comments marked [...] "B. 1816," [...] has been assumed to have been prepared as a <b>press</b> <b>copy</b> for the Fifth Edition; but, as the following collation reveals, the latter, which belonged to Leigh Hunt, represents a fuller and later, though not a final revision.

6000|$|The {{inference}} of Mr. Croker {{from the}} variations must be reversed. They do not invalidate, but attest, the fidelity of Warburton, and the [...] "alterations" [...] {{in the text}} of the poems must pass unchallenged unless there is some direct proof of their inaccuracy. The arguments, on the contrary, are altogether in their favour. Four printed pages of the first Moral Essay, with the corrections in manuscript, were discovered by Mr. Kilvert among Warburton's papers. [...] "Some of the words," [...] says Mr. Croker, [...] "are so neatly written as to leave a strong impression on my eye of their being Pope's; other portions of the manuscript are more like Warburton's looser hand." [...] The faint doubt expressed by Mr. Croker would hardly have arisen if his suspicion had not been previously awakened, for the corrections are all indubitably in the handwriting of the poet. Nor was the manuscript in this instance the guide of Warburton. He followed a copy of the Moral Essays printed by Pope in his last illness, though never published. [...] "Warburton has the propriety of it as you know," [...] wrote Bolingbroke to Lord Marchmont, one of the executors; [...] "alter it he cannot by the terms of the will."[2] This of itself is an answer to Mr. Croker. The executors had access to Pope's latest printed version of the Moral Essays, which was Warburton's avowed authority, and he could not alter a single word without certain detection, and the consequent forfeiture of his legacy. He was alive to the risk. A portion of Pope's revised edition of his poetical works was passing through the press {{at the time of his}} death, and Warburton directed the printer to give the sheets, when the executors inquired for them, to their colleague the celebrated Murray, who was afterwards Lord Mansfield, adding, [...] "Pray preserve all the <b>press</b> <b>copy</b> to the least scrap."[3] The terms of the will bound the editor to be faithful to his trust, under a penalty of 4,000l., the estimated value of the bequest,[4] and he saw the necessity of having the voucher of the poet's handwriting for the minutest departure from the previous text in such of the proofs as had not received Pope's final imprimatur. A more ample guarantee could not be desired for the authenticity of the particulars in which Warburton's text differs from the printed copies superintended by Pope. All the displaced readings, which are not utterly insignificant, are preserved in the notes to the present edition, as well as numerous unpublished variations, which are taken from the manuscripts of Pope, or the transcripts of Richardson.|$|E

To begin with Engels was enthusiastic about the book, and expressed his opinions freely in letters to Marx: But what is true in his principle, we, too, must accept. And what is true is that before we can be active in any cause we must make it our own, egoistic cause-and that in this sense, quite aside from any material expectations, we are communists in virtue of our egoism, that out of egoism we want to be human beings and not merely individuals." ...|$|E

Shows were typically 90 minutes long. Bono was emotional and very theatrical during shows; during songs he would climb lighting rigs, plunge into the audience, or walk out onto side balconies.

[...] "40"'s show-closing, thoughtful presence - wherein The Edge and bassist Adam Clayton swapped instruments, then three band members left one by one leaving only drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. - grew into an audience participation ritual that would continue even after the band had left the stage.
