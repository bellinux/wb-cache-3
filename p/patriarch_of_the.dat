Ministers, including Henry Muhlenberg disciple Christian Streit, began to establish congregations in the largest communities of western Virginia. Muhlenberg was a German pastor, requested by colonists in Pennsylvania, {{who served as a}} missionary there from 1742 until his death in 1787; he is considered the <b>patriarch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lutheran Church in the United States.

5|$|The film {{attracted}} {{attention for}} {{the appearance of}} Orson Welles as Will Varner, the <b>patriarch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family. 20th Century Fox wanted to avoid the casting of Welles due to his temperament, but the studio was persuaded by Ritt, who considered him the right actor for the role. The director and the actor had several marked differences during the shooting of the movie, which included problems with {{the interpretation of the}} lines, costume design and the position of Welles while shooting the scenes. At one point during the production, Welles informed Ritt {{that he did not want}} to memorize his lines, requesting instead that they be dubbed afterwards. Part of the cast was intimidated by Welles' temperamental attitude.|$|E
5|$|The novel's {{characters}} represent polarities of contrasting morality. The vengeful Bette and disingenuous Valérie {{stand on}} one side, with the merciful Adeline and her patient daughter Hortense on the other. The <b>patriarch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hulot family, meanwhile, is consumed {{by his own}} sexual desire. Hortense's husband, the Polish exile Wenceslas Steinbock, represents artistic genius, though he succumbs to uncertainty and lack of motivation. Balzac based the character of Bette in part on his mother and the poet Marceline Desbordes-Valmore. At least one scene involving Baron Hulot was likely based on an event {{in the life of}} Balzac's friend, the novelist Victor Hugo.|$|E

5|$|Juan Larrea {{was born}} on June 24, 1782, {{in the city of}} Mataró, Catalonia. His father was Martín Ramón de Larrea, {{who was in charge of}} customs {{operations}} in Mataró, and his mother was Tomasa Espeso. He studied mathematics and navigation, and focused his education towards a career in commerce. His father died in 1793, so Larrea became the <b>patriarch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family. They moved to Buenos Aires, where he established a warehouse for wines, leather, and sugar. He traded with Peru, Upper Peru, Paraguay, Chile and colonial Brazil. By 1806 he was a well respected businessman, and a syndic of the Royal Consulate. He promoted the role of deputies from Buenos Aires at the Madrid court, to better the representation of the Brazilian viceroyalty and reduce the privileges of peninsular merchants.|$|E
5|$|Rabban Bar Sauma, a Nestorian Christian Uyghur Turk born in Zhongdu (later Khanbaliq, Beijing, {{capital of}} the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty), China, was sent to Europe in 1287 as an {{ambassador}} for Arghun, ruler of the Ilkhanate and grandnephew of Kublai Khan. He was preceded by Isa Kelemechi, an Assyrian Nestorian Christian {{who worked as a}} court astronomer for Kublai Khan in Khanbaliq, and was sent by Arghun to Pope Honorius IV in 1285. A decade earlier, Bar Sauma had originally set out on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, passing through Gansu and Khotan in Northwest China, yet spent time in Armenia and Baghdad instead to avoid getting caught up in nearby armed conflicts. He had been accompanied by Rabban Markos, another Uyghur Nestorian Christian from China who was elected as the <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Church and advised Arghun Khan to have Bar Sauma lead the diplomatic mission to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{returned}} from Poland and defeated the invaders with Polish assistance at Cătlăbuga Lake in November. He again confronted the Ottomans at Șcheia in March 1486, {{but could not}} recapture Chilia and Cetatea Albă. He narrowly escaped with his life, reportedly after being helped by the Aprod Purice, whom tradition identifies as <b>patriarch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Movilești family. Historian Vasile Mărculeț agrees with Ottoman sources in noting that that Șcheia was not a military victory for Moldavia, but overall a relative success for his enemy, Skender Pasha. Moldavians reported winning the day only because they narrowly avoided disaster; and because Hronoda, recognized a voivode by dissenting boyars, was captured and beheaded. In the end, Stephen signed a three-year truce with the Porte, promising to pay the yearly tribute to the Sultan.|$|E

5|$|In other countries, {{the state}} played a {{stronger}} {{role in the}} process of commissioning memorials. France, for example, mostly relied on local communities to organise and commission most war memorials, but the state played a comparatively larger role than in Britain and similar countries. A law was passed in 1919 establishing an official role for local government officials {{in the process of}} commissioning memorials; many towns then formed committees to take this process forward, typically at the commune level. Members of the Souvenir Français organisation {{played an important role in}} many of the resulting local committees. In other cases, governments increased their role in commissioning memorials during the inter-war period. In Romania, most memorials in the early 1920s were initially erected by local communities; in 1919 the royal family created the Societatea Cultul Eroilor Morţi to oversee commemoration of the war more generally; the organisation was headed by the <b>Patriarch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Romanian Orthodox Church. By the 1930s official concern over the diverse range of designs led to increased central control over the process.|$|E
5|$|On 8 May 2013, Ferguson {{announced}} that he was to retire as manager {{at the end of the}} football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador. The club announced the next day that Everton manager David Moyes would replace him from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract. Ryan Giggs took over as interim player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1995–96. They also failed to qualify for the Europa League, meaning that it was the first time Manchester United hadn't qualified for a European competition since 1990. On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that Louis van Gaal would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year deal, with Giggs as his assistant. Malcolm Glazer, the <b>patriarch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Glazer family that owns the club, died on 28 May 2014.|$|E
5|$|T.C. Russell is the <b>patriarch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russell family. He is {{characterized}} by his violent temper and hatred of Julian Crane for supposedly injuring him in a hit-and-run attack, and destroying his chances of becoming a professional tennis player. T.C. is initially portrayed as a harsh and unforgiving parent; he pushes Whitney to train to be a tennis champion, as he once wanted to be, and disapproves of her relationship with Chad Harris-Crane, feeling it is a distraction. He is also violent with Simone when she reveals she is a lesbian. After learning about Eve's past relationship with Julian and her responsibility for the car crash that ended his tennis career, T. C. files for divorce and has a brief romance and engagement to her adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne. The show humanizes T.C. and softens his temper during his recovery from a stroke; his final storylines focus on his attempts to rebuild {{his relationship with his}} ex-wife and children. In 2007, he moves to New Orleans to help Whitney with her pregnancy and reconnect with Simone. T.C. does not appear in the show after its transition to DirecTV, and he is neither seen nor mentioned in the series finale.|$|E
