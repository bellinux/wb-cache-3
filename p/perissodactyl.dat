5|$|The simple, low-crowned teeth {{indicate}} that Paraceratherium was a browser with a diet consisting of relatively soft leaves and shrubs. Later rhinoceroses were grazers, with high-crowned teeth because their diets contained grit that quickly wore down their teeth. Studies of mesowear on Paraceratherium teeth confirm the creatures {{had a soft}} diet of leaves; microwear studies {{have yet to be}} conducted. Isotope analysis shows that Paraceratherium fed chiefly on C3 plants, which are mainly leaves. Like its <b>perissodactyl</b> relatives, the horses, tapirs, and other rhinoceroses, Paraceratherium would have been a hindgut fermenter; it would extract relatively little nutrition from its food and would have to eat large volumes to survive. Like other large herbivores, Paraceratherium would have had a large digestive tract.|$|E
25|$|Totaling 42 to 44 teeth, this {{dentition}} {{is closer}} to that of equids, which may differ by one less canine, than their other <b>perissodactyl</b> relatives, rhinoceroses. Their incisors are chisel-shaped, with the third large, conical upper incisor separated by a short gap from the considerably smaller canine. A much longer gap is found between the canines and premolars, {{the first of which}} may be absent. Tapirs are lophodonts, and their cheek teeth have distinct lophs (ridges) between protocones, paracones, metacones and hypocones.|$|E
2500|$|The genus Daeodon {{was erected}} by the American anatomist and {{paleontologist}} Edward Drinker Cope in 1878. He classified it as a <b>perissodactyl</b> {{and thought that}} it was closely related to Menodus. This classification persisted until the description of [...] "Elotherium" [...] calkinsi in 1905, a very similar and much more complete animal from the same rocks, which was promptly assigned as a species of Daeodon by Peterson (1909). This led to Daeodon's reclassification {{as a member of the}} family Entelodontidae. The exact relationships between Daeodon and other entelodonts are not well understood, some authors (Lucas et al., 1998) consider the greater morphological similarity of Daeodon to Paraentelodon rather than to earlier North American entelodonts, like Archaeotherium, as evidence for Daeodon being a descendent from a Late Oligocene immigration of large Asian entelodonts to North America. However, the existence of distinct specimens of Archoetherium showing characters reminiscent of those present in both Paraentelodon and Daeodon raises the possibility of both genera actually descending from a North American common ancestor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Perissodactyls</b> have a mesaxonic foot {{meaning that}} the weight is {{distributed}} on the third toe on all legs thanks to the plane symmetry of their feet.

In consequence, there was an alternative name for the <b>perissodactyls</b> the nearly obsolete Mesaxonia. <b>Perissodactyls</b> are not the only lineage of mammals to have evolved this trait; the meridiungulates have evolved mesaxonic feet numerous times.|$|R

Just call {{up in your}} mind the picture of your own Maggie or Vera or Beatrice, straighten her nose, soften her voice, tone her down and then tone her up, make her beautiful and unattainable--and you have a faint dry-point etching of Alice. The family owned a crumbly brick house and a coachman named Joseph in a coat of many colours, and a horse so old that he claimed {{to belong to the}} order of the Perissodactyla, and had toes instead of hoofs. In the year 1898 the family had to buy a new set of harness for the <b>Perissodactyl.</b> Before using it they made Joseph smear it over with a mixture of ashes and soot. It was the Von der Ruysling family that bought the territory between the Bowery and East River and Rivington Street and the Statue of Liberty, in the year 1649, from an Indian chief for a quart of passementerie and a pair of Turkey-red portières designed for a Harlem flat. I have always admired that Indian's perspicacity and good taste. All this is merely to convince you that the Von der Ruyslings were exactly the kind of poor aristocrats that turn down their noses at people who have money. Oh, well, I don't mean that; I mean people who have just money.|$|E

50|$|Cambaytherium is {{considered}} to be close to the ancestry of Perissodactyla, the odd-toed ungulates. It retains features later lost among its sister mammals, the <b>perissodactyls,</b> which includes tapirs, rhinoceroses, and horses. The presence of the sister group of <b>perissodactyls</b> in western India near or before the time of its collision with Asia, suggests that Perissodactyla may have originated on the Indian Plate during its final drift toward Asia.|$|R
40|$|Since the Eocene, the {{diversity}} of artiodactyls has increased while that of <b>perissodactyls</b> has decreased. Reasons given for this contrasting pattern are that {{the evolution of a}} ruminant digestive tract and improved locomotion in artiodactyls were adaptively advantageous in the highly seasonal post-Eocene climate. We suggest that evolution of a carotid rete, a structure highly developed in artiodactyls but absent in <b>perissodactyls,</b> was at least as important. The rete confers an ability to regulate brain temperature independently of body temperature. The net effect is that in hot ambient conditions artiodactyls are able to conserve energy and water, and in cold ambient conditions they are able to conserve body temperature. In <b>perissodactyls,</b> brain and body temperature change in parallel and thermoregulation requires abundant food and water to warm/cool the body. Consequently, <b>perissodactyls</b> occupy habitats of low seasonality and rich in food and water, such as tropical forests. Conversely, the increased thermoregulatory flexibility of artiodactyls has facilitated invasion of new adaptive zones ranging from the Arctic Circle to deserts and tropical savannahs...|$|R

50|$|All <b>perissodactyls</b> are hindgut fermenters. In {{contrast}} to ruminants, hindgut fermenters store digested food {{that has left}} the stomach in an enlarged cecum, where the food is digested by bacteria. No gallbladder is present. The stomach of <b>perissodactyls</b> is simply built, while the cecum accommodates up to 90 L in horses. The intestine is very long, reaching up to 26 m in horses. Extraction of nutrients from food is relatively inefficient, which probably explains why no odd-toed ungulates are small; for large animals, nutritional requirements per unit of body weight are lower and the surface-to-volume ratio is smaller.|$|R
50|$|This {{order is}} united with other South-American {{ungulates}} in the super-order Meridiungulata.
