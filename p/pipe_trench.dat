40|$|International audienceThe 1990 s {{epidemiological}} studies by Payment and colleagues suggested that {{an increase in}} gastrointestinal illnesses observed in the population consuming tap water from a system meeting all water quality regulations might be associated with distribution system deficiencies. In the current study, the vulnerability of this distribution system to microbial intrusion was assessed by characterizing potential sources of contamination near pipelines and monitoring the frequency and magnitude of negative pressures. Bacterial indicators of fecal contamination were recovered more frequently in the water from flooded air-valve vaults than in the soil or water from <b>pipe</b> <b>trenches.</b> The level of fecal contamination in these various sources was more similar to levels from river water rather than wastewater. Because of its configuration, this distribution system is vulnerable to negative pressures when pressure values out of the treatment plant reach or drop below 172 kPa (25 psi), which occurred nine times during a monitoring period of 17 months. The results from this investigation suggest that this distribution system is vulnerable to contamination by intrusion. Comparison of the frequency of occurrence of negative pressure events and repair rates with data from other distribution systems suggests that the system studied by Payment and colleagues is not atypical...|$|R

After graduation, Zwart worked with architectural firms in Princeton, Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Aptos, California, Philadelphia, and Carmel before returning to UC Santa Cruz in 1985 as a staff architect and project manager. Thus he commenced a long and distinguished career at UCSC that spanned the tenures of seven UCSC chancellors. Zwart became Campus Architect in 1988 and directed UCSC’s Office of Physical Planning & Construction (PP&C) until his retirement in April 2010.

30|$|It can be {{concluded}} {{that the use of}} highly plastic clay as a backfill material is not recommended for underground small diameter pipelines. In addition, it is highly recommended that the design guidelines of buried pipelines should take into consideration the volume change characteristics of the native soil deposits (specially for highly plastic clay soils) surrounding the pipe itself or the <b>pipe</b> <b>trench</b> in case of using a granular backfill material. One key criterion is to specify a minimum pipe depth below the ground surface for different pipe types in order to minimize the resulting soil swell-shrink induced pipe displacements.|$|E
30|$|Trickey and Moore (2007) {{performed}} a numerical analysis for pipes of varying stiffness and embedment depth. It {{was found that}} the burial depth had little impact on the peak deformation for stiff (rigid) pipes located close to the ground surface. However, for flexible pipe, the peak deformation decreased significantly as embedment depth increased. Barbato et al. (2010) used a linear elastic finite element model to study the effects of geometric and mechanical parameters that characterize the soil-structure interaction developed in a buried pipe located under highways. The study concluded that the soil-pipe interaction system considerably depends not only on the pipe material and stiffness, but also on the geometric parameters defining the <b>pipe</b> <b>trench.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for fast and economical transportation systems sets railways {{as one of}} the most important transportation modes. In addition due to technological advances new trains are increasingly fast. This fact requires an improvement to the construction as well as to maintenance operations of railway systems. Knowledge of applying geophysical sensor techniques on pavements was transferred to railways by taking advantage of the ability of ground penetrating radar to map substructure conditions on a continuous non-destructive basis. The study examines pilot sections, which are integrated in the National Railway System of Greece and are representative of the Greek Railways regarding structural and operational elements. For the present study a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) system as well as the Videocar of the National Technical University of Athens have been used. The GPR system consists of an air-coupled 1 GHz frequency antenna and a ground coupled 400 MHz antenna. Data was acquired between concrete and wood ties as well as from the ballast shoulders beyond the ends of the ties, using the two antennas with multiple antenna orientations and polarizations. Automatic processing of the data was developed to quickly generate hard copy sections of radar images. Substructure conditions were observed such as thickness of the ballast and sub ballast layers, variations in layer thickness along the track, pockets of water trapped in the ballast, and soft subgrades from high water content. In addition, locations and depths of subsurface drainage <b>pipes,</b> <b>trenches,</b> and utilities were quickly and continuously mapped. In addition to in-situ measurements a Global Position System (GPS) was used in order to record exact coordinates of the sections under study. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|R

40|$|The {{rehabilitation}} of pipelines {{is an essential}} task for protecting and preserving our natural environment. An important solution {{of the problem is}} to renovate damaged pipelines by insertion of liner pipes. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe the structural interaction between the outer pipe and the liner pipe. Overstressing of a rigid outer pipe causes longitudinal cracks, which appear primarily at the invert, crown and springings. The longitudinally cracked outer pipe acting as four-hinge ring develops considerable load bearing capacity because the part of the vertical load which exceeds the horizontal load is transferred to the soil as a horizontal thrust in the region of the springings. The horizontal displacements of the springings associated with development of this passive soil support cause rotations of the quarter-ring segments which the liner pipe has to follow. Applying the theory of elasticity, second order differential equations were developed to describe the soil stress state in the <b>pipe</b> <b>trench,</b> taking into account statically indeterminate shear forces acting on vertical planes through the pipe springings and on the trench walls. The stress resultants in the liner pipe were then determined for every practically possible case of soil support of the four-hinge outer ring, and as a function of friction at the contact surfaces between the two pipes and of the open crack widths at the crown and invert of the outer pipe. The theoretical results of the elastic analysis of the liner pipe were compared with the results of various model experiments executed by the LGA Landesgewerbeanstalt Bayern, and a satisfactory agreement obtained.

40|$|The U-Plant {{is one of}} {{the five}} major nuclear {{materials}} processing facilities at Hanford and was chosen as a pilot project to develop the modalities for closure of the other four facilities at Hanford {{and the rest of the}} Department of Energy (DOE) complex. The remedy for this facility was determined by a Record of Decision (ROD) pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). That remedy was to 'Close in Place - Partially Demolished Structure'. The U-Plant facility is identified as the 221 -U Building and is a large, concrete structure nominally 247 m (810 ft) long, 20 M (66 ft) wide and 24 m (77 ft) high with approximately 9 m (30 ft) being below grade level. It is a robust facility with walls ranging from 0. 9 m to 2. 7 m (3 ft to 9 ft) thick. One large room extends the entire length of the building that provides access to 40 sub-grade processing cells containing tanks, piping and other components. The work breakdown was divided into three major deliverables: (1) Tank D- 10 Removal: removal of Tank D- 10, which contained TRU waste; (2) Equipment Disposition: placement of contaminated equipment in the sub-grade cells; and (3) Canyon Grouting: grouting canyon void spaces to the maximum extent practical. A large number of pieces of contaminated equipment (pumps, piping, centrifuges, tanks, etc) from other facilities that had been stored on the canyon operating floor were placed inside of the sub-grade cells as final disposition, grouted and the cell shield plug reinstalled. This action precluded a large volume of waste being transported to another burial site. Finally, {approx} 19, 000 m 3 ({approx} 25, 000 yd 3) of grout was placed inside of the cells (in and around the contaminated equipment), in the major galleries. the ventilation tunnel, the external ventilation duct, and the hot <b>pipe</b> <b>trench</b> to minimize the potential for void spaces and to reduce the mobility, solubility, and/or toxicity of the grouted waste.

40|$|In {{the summer}} of 1961 in Sion (Valais, Switzerland) the slabs of a prehistoric tomb {{appeared}} in a <b>pipe</b> <b>trench</b> at the Avenue du Petit-Chasseur. While uncovering them, someone exclaimed: “prehistoric engravings!”. The first funerary stela of the megalithic site had been discovered. The excavations, first conducted by Olivier-Jean Bocksberger, high school teacher at Aigle, then by Alain Gallay of the University of Geneva, lasted about ten years. Patiently reconstructed by the scientists, the eventful history of this necropolis {{made it possible for}} the rites, the beliefs and the social structure of these prehistoric communities in Valais to be studied in detail. Later, between 1987 and 2003, further investigations were carried out in the area and added to the discoveries. In order to commemorate the 50 th anniversary of the discovery of the site, a scientific committee consisting of the representatives of the Archéologie cantonale and the Musées cantonaux du Valais, and of the University of Geneva and the Association valaisanne d’archéologie organised several events during autumn 2011. An international conference was held from 27 October to 29 October in Sion, at the François-Xavier Bagnoud hall. The necropolis of Sion still remains a key reference for the understanding of the Final Neolithic period, not only in the Alpine countries, but also throughout Europe. The scientific meeting therefore focused {{on the end of the}} Neolithic period in Valais and in the adjacent regions, on the Bell Beaker phenomenon (a European culture?) and on the funerary rites of this period whereas the doctoral course dealt with the end of the Neolithic period in Valais and with the anthropology of megalithic societies. The conference was attended by nearly 200 people, students, junior and senior scholars from many countries including Austria, Belgium, Spain, France, Hungary, Italy, Morocco, the Netherlands, Poland, the Czech Republic and Switzerland.
