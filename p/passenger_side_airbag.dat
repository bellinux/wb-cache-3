2500|$|... 1994: The first facelift: Front {{grill and}} {{headlamps}} were redesigned, 'sculpted' aluminum turbine rims were made available. [...] A major redesign to the dash added a <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> {{and made it}} less cluttered and more modern. [...] A new model was introduced, the Luxury Sport Sedan (LSS). [...] Engineers fitted bucket seats (a pair of right-hand halves of the standard 60/40 split bench seat), floor shifter and a center console (borrowed from the previous generation Pontiac Bonneville SSE) into the interior, and full instrumentation for the dash. [...] Higher spring rates and larger diameter stabilizer bars for {{the front and rear}} suspension gave the LSS a firm ride and more controlled handling.|$|E
50|$|Driver {{side airbag}} {{standard}} in RHD cars, <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> {{not available in}} them.|$|E
5000|$|Airbags, as an {{additional}} measure of occupant protection. The driver side airbag premiered on 1981 models, as an optional extra (standard from 1985 on 500 SEL and 500 SEC), and the <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> premiered in 1987 and became available in February 1988 (as an optional extra; due to its expense, few early production W126 cars were thus equipped). The <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> became standard in 1989 for the U.S. V8 models and was made standard in 1990 for all 1991 models.|$|E
2500|$|Driver's and <b>passenger's</b> <b>airbags</b> (<b>side</b> <b>airbags</b> added {{from late}} 2005) ...|$|R
50|$|Safety {{equipment}} includes front <b>airbags</b> with <b>side</b> curtain <b>airbags</b> {{and front}} <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbags</b> (for {{a total of}} six airbags) and brake assist that detects panic-braking situations and applies maximum braking force more quickly.|$|R
50|$|In late 1998, the 1999 3.5RL {{received}} a {{front and rear}} facelift with integrated foglights, revised bumpers and hood, as well as driver and front <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbags.</b> The suspension and chassis were stiffened, and new alloy wheels were offered.|$|R
50|$|Intelligent Key {{was added}} to the Wingroad September 11, 2006, and the Wingroad can be {{equipped}} with a GPS navigation package using HDD technology. The AD Van had been sold without <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag,</b> but from May 2009 this became standard across the range.|$|E
50|$|The {{city has}} some very strict rules {{in order to control}} the taxi services. The number of taxis is limited. All taxis must be {{completely}} or partially painted in yellow, must have <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> and air conditioning. They must also have a yellow sign on their top with a red and green light to indicate if they are free.|$|E
50|$|When the Diamante was updated in 1994, sedans {{received}} revised taillamps, and a four-spoke {{steering wheel}} with audio controls. All models now included a <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> and cruise control as standard. For the LS, the manual sunroof was deleted from the option list {{and replaced with}} a CD player, power sunroof and traction control. Anti-lock brakes were standard on the LS and optional on the ES and wagon.|$|E
5000|$|The xD comes {{standard}} {{with power}} locks, mirrors, and windows, and 16" [...] wheels. The vehicle also has ABS, a tire pressure monitoring system, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) with Traction Control (TRAC), dual stage driver and passenger airbags, seat mounted driver and <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbags,</b> and <b>side</b> curtain <b>airbags</b> as standard features.|$|R
50|$|Visia model {{includes}} remote central locking, front power windows, {{electric power}} steering, 14-inch wheels {{and a full}} complement of safety equipment including driver and front <b>passenger</b> <b>airbags,</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbags</b> and curtain bags, ABS and ESP.|$|R
5000|$|... 1994: Launched in November 1993, a {{redesigned}} dashboard and {{instrument panel}} was new for 1994. All 1994 Town & Country's {{were given a}} <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> and knee bolsters. Side door guard beams were installed this year, so that they met 1998 federal side impact standards. Also made standard was a 3.8 L V6 engine.|$|R
50|$|The four {{wheel drive}} system {{introduced}} on this generation was borrowed from the Toyota Celica GT-Four. Four wheel steering was available. The trim level designations were 1800V, 2000X, 2000GT and 2000GT-4WD. As a result of styling changes, sales improved {{in comparison to the}} second generation. A driver side airbag appeared September 1995, as well as speed sensitive door locks and climate control air conditioning. A <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> appeared June 1996. Production ended due to economic conditions April 1998.|$|E
5000|$|The Eldorado {{continued}} {{for the rest}} of the decade with incremental changes and tapering sales. A <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> was added as standard equipment in 1993. Styling was freshened in 1995, with updated bumpers front and rear, side cladding, and a new grille. In 1996, the interior received attention, with a new upholstery style, larger analog gauge cluster, relocated climate control system, updated stereo faces and standard daytime running lights. The ETC receives rain-sensing wipers called [...] "Rainsense." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 1994: The first facelift: Front {{grill and}} {{headlamps}} were redesigned, 'sculpted' aluminum turbine rims were made available. A major redesign to the dash added a <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> {{and made it}} less cluttered and more modern. A new model was introduced, the Luxury Sport Sedan (LSS).

Higher spring rates and larger diameter stabilizer bars for {{the front and rear}} suspension gave the LSS a firm ride and more controlled handling.|$|E
5000|$|... 1995: A <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> on all Summits {{replaced}} the other motorized seatbelt, and ES models were renamed ESi. More significantly, the 1994 demise of both Colts left the Summit {{as the only}} remaining Mirage clone, and the cancellation of the Mirage sedan {{at the end of}} 1994 left the Summit as the only four-door offering.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>passenger</b> <b>side's</b> front <b>airbag,</b> {{steering}} column, {{and exterior}} and interior door handles are from the Chevrolet Cobalt ...|$|R
50|$|In 1981, the W126 {{introduced}} a driver <b>side</b> <b>airbag,</b> as patented by Mercedes-Benz in 1971, {{as well as}} the <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbags</b> (in 1988), seat-belt pretensioners, and traction control. It was the first production car to feature an airbag standard, and as late as 1991 {{there were only a few}} other manufacturers in Europe who offered an airbag. The interior featured additional courtesy and reading lamps, along with heated seats and a more advanced climate control system. A four-speed automatic transmission was standard.|$|R
5000|$|The van was face-lifted in 1995 for the 1996 model year, adding driver's side rear door, <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag,</b> and {{extending}} the nose for improved crash protection. While the four-cylinder engine was retired for the American and Canadian markets, it {{was replaced with}} a similar but somewhat smaller 2.5 L unit {{for the rest of}} the world. A mild refresh was introduced in 1997 for the 1998 model year with [...] "all-sport" [...] body cladding and wheel arches, and polished alloy wheels. Mazda discontinued the original MPV after the 1998 model year for North America, and after the 1999 model year {{for the rest of the}} world.|$|E
50|$|While the {{standard}} S-10 {{moved to a}} redesigned front fascia in 1998, the S-10 Electric kept the same front fascia as the '94-'97, {{with the exception of}} composite headlamps in 1998 versus the previous year's sealed-beam headlamps. The interior was also updated in 1998 along with internal combustion models, adding a <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag.</b> Aside from this header panel, a unique lower bumper valance, and a stylized 'Electric' decal {{on the bottom of the}} doors, there is little difference externally between the appearance of an Electric and a stock S-10. Any changes, however minimal, were reported to have had a positive influence on reducing the truck's aerodynamic resistance. These changes included a closed grille and a front air skirt, belly pans beneath the front suspension, a seal between the cab and the pickup bed, and a half-length tonneau cover over the rear of the pickup bed.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{generation}} model was introduced October 24, 1990, {{and continued to}} offer both a sedan and coup√©. The Rover 800 was not updated to the new platform, and instead continued with the old XX platform. In Japan, this Legend was {{also known as the}} [...] "Super Legend" [...] due to the much larger 3.2 C32A engine, which was now the only engine offered in the Legend. The Type I engine was rated at , and the Type II was rated at [...] and included with the touring system. This Legend benefited from much of the research and testing done for Honda's new mid-engined high performance sports car, the Honda NSX, and the Legend was used as a test platform for new NSX technologies and research. Honda introduced a <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> on this model, and used off-set collision testing to improve collision performance and safety.|$|E
50|$|The W220 S-Class added {{standard}} {{front and}} rear <b>side</b> curtain <b>airbags.</b> In total, the W220 features 8 airbags: 2 frontal (driver and <b>passenger),</b> 4 <b>side</b> <b>airbags</b> (one in each door) and 2 window-airbags.|$|R
50|$|The car {{comes in}} three {{different}} trim levels: Standard, Norm and Lux. The Norm level includes power steering, front power windows, power door locks and trip computer, while Lux adds <b>passenger</b> <b>airbag,</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbags,</b> ABS, ESC, rear power windows, air conditioning, heated mirrors, heated front seats, and multimedia system with a 7-inch touchscreen display.|$|R
50|$|The ZX {{specification}} {{was good}} for its class, with most models getting power steering, electric windows, electric sunroof, a driver's <b>side</b> (and sometimes <b>passenger's</b> <b>side)</b> <b>airbag</b> and anti-lock braking system as either optional or standard equipment. It was competitively priced though, unlike the Mark III Volkswagen Golf, which was priced at a relative premium from its launch later in 1991. It also reached the market {{a few months before}} the new version of the Opel/Vauxhall Astra.|$|R
5000|$|In 1992, the 1993 LeBaron {{received}} a slight restyling. The hidden headlamps of the 1987-1992 models were deleted {{in favor of}} less costly aerodynamic replaceable-bulb headlamps, new wheel styles were made available, and all models got the amber rear turn signals introduced on the deluxe 1992 models. New for 1994, was the [...] "Bright LX" [...] decor package and a <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag.</b> It included a [...] "bright" [...] chrome grille, [...] "bright" [...] chrome badging, and [...] "bright" [...] chrome molding inserts, {{as opposed to being}} body-colored on the GTC. Available engines were naturally aspirated 2.5 L and turbocharged 2.2 and 2.5 L versions of Chrysler's I4, and the 3.0 L Mitsubishi V6 making a [...] in this application. The coupe was discontinued after 1993. In 1994 the 3.0 was the only available engine. The convertible was discontinued after 1995, {{to make way for the}} new Chrysler Sebring coupes and convertibles, for 1995 and 1996 respectively.|$|E
50|$|Honda started local {{production}} {{and sale of}} Fit in April 2003 when Brazil became the second production base, after Japan, for Fit. In Brazil, though initially was available with the 1.3 L i-DSI engine only, eventually the Fit has the same engines as the Japanese models (all Brazilian Honda cars have engines imported from Japan) and there are three trim levels available. Base model LX features the 1.35 i-DSI engine (which is marketed as 1.4 in Brazil) and driver side airbag. The second model in the range, the LXL, features the same engine from the LX, but adds some extra equipment: <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> and ABS. Top model EX has essentially the same equipment as the LXL, but comes with the 1.5 VTEC engine. All models are available with the five-speed manual or the regular CVT automatic. There are neither side airbags nor side curtains available for the Brazilian version. Also, the radio antenna is positioned differently, as it is {{near the front of}} the roof. Honda started selling the 2007 model in February 2006 with new bumpers and some cosmetic changes.|$|E
50|$|The Teeter-Totter - This {{traditional}} {{challenge from}} Canada's Worst Driver 3 (but presented in its Canada's Worst Driver 4 incarnation) has contestants drive a stick-shift Mini Cooper and balance it on a teeter-totter. Lance, who drives a stick-shift car (only two contestants, Dale and Jamie, have no prior stick-shift experience), quickly burns through the clutch. Andrew {{notes that the}} clutch was probably {{on the verge of}} failure anyway since it burned out so quickly, so the Mini Cooper is replaced by a 1990 Mazda Miata. Lance slowly kills the clutch on that car as well, and fails the challenge. In a third car, Diane manages to balance after repeated rocking of the teeter-totter. Paul finishes quickly, as his motorcycle experience pays off (like stick-shift cars, motorcycles also have a clutch). Donna is unable to accompany Brad due to a shoulder injury, so Andrew accompanies Brad through his run. Another burned clutch causes him to fail. Dean destroys the clutch on a fourth car in his run, and he fails. During Dean's run attention was called to Brian's habit of putting his feet on the dashboard, which Cam noted would cause him to be severely injured if the <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> triggered. Dale drives right off the teeter-totter and burns the clutch off of a fifth car. But that means Jamie, going last, is exempt from doing the challenge, as they are out of cars.|$|E
50|$|The C215 CL-Class added {{standard}} {{front and}} rear <b>side</b> curtain <b>airbags.</b> In total, the C215 features 8 airbags: 2 frontal (driver and <b>passenger),</b> 4 <b>side</b> <b>airbags</b> (one for each passenger, optional for rear seats) and 2 window-airbags.|$|R
50|$|Having {{come to a}} halt, and {{thinking}} that it was safe, Hsu unbuckled her seat belt before the Mini Cooper's rear-end {{was hit by a}} truck. When the collision occurred, only the <b>passenger</b> <b>side's</b> <b>airbag</b> was deployed. The front airbag failed to deploy (airbags are not designed to deploy in rear impact collision). Contrary to witness' testimony, her assistant denied being the driver {{at the time of the}} accident. She developed post-traumatic hydrocephalus in which the increased pressure crushed the brainstem.|$|R
5000|$|Along {{with the}} {{exterior}} changes, improved specification levels were present; with the entry level models {{such as the}} [...] "S" [...] featuring automatic climate control, driver, <b>passenger,</b> and <b>side</b> <b>airbags.</b> Further up the model range, other features were seen such as Xenon headlamps.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the first}} time for a Mazda, the 626 began {{manufacturing}} overseas in the US at Flat Rock, Michigan on 1 September 1992 for the 1993 model year. The car was originally known as the [...] "626 Cronos" [...] in Canada, but dropped the Cronos for the 1996 model year. Mazda's 2.5-liter V6 engine debuted to rave reviews. Though the 626's manual transmission was highly regarded, Four-cylinder 626s from 1994 onwards used the Ford CD4E automatic transmission (designated by Mazda as LA4A-EL), which was an attempt to solve some of the 1993 model's transmission related issues. The CD4E was manufactured by Ford at their Batavia, Ohio facility. The CD4E was manufactured in Batavia, Ohio under the partnership name of ZF Batavia; a joint venture between Ford and ZF Friedrichshafen AG. It wasn't until a few years after the fourth generation of the Mazda 626 was produced that it became known for its extremely high failure rate, thus making the change in 1994 to the CD4E an irrelevant one. It is widely known to transmission specialists that the CD4E overheats due to a poorly designed valve body and torque converter. Mazda issued a couple of Technical Service Bulletins (0400502, 01598, 003/97K, 006/95) regarding the transmission and torque converter. Dealerships were briefly instructed to install an external transmission cooler, but at cost to the owner and only if requested. The CD4E was produced until 2008 at Batavia. No recall was ever issued for a single year of the CD4E, causing a loss of confidence from the general public in years to come. In 1994, a <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> was added, whilst some models of the 1994 and 1995 Mazda 626 2.0L automatics were outfitted with Ford's EEC-IV diagnostic system. In North America, the V6 spread to the LX trim in addition to the leather ES trim. New for 1996 and 1997 models were a redesigned hood (raised center portion), chrome grille fairing (attached to the hood), and the introduction of the on Board Diagnostics II revision (OBD-II).|$|E
5000|$|Trim {{packages}} {{started with}} the top level Ultima Grand Selection with the 3.0 V6 engine, the Ultima with the 3.0 V6, (later the Ultima received the 3.0 V6 turbo), the XS-II Grand Selection with the 2.0 V6 Turbo, the XS-II with the 2.0 V6 Turbo, the XS with the V6 Turbo, the XJ-II with a 2.0 V6 and the base model called the XJ with the 2.0 V6. All models came with a digital instrument cluster, all models except the XS and the XJ came with stereo and cruise control buttons installed in the steering wheel center pad, and both Grand Selection models were installed with a 6-inch TV screen installed in the dashboard below the A/C controls that allowed passengers to watch broadcast TV if the transmission was in Park and the parking brake applied. The video entertainment system also had RCA connections to attach a camcorder and watch recorded video. The stereo and video equipment was supplied by Sony.The Leopard F31 had few factory options, but dealers offered {{the addition of a}} cellular phone installed in a dedicated compartment in the dashboard above the glove compartment where a modern <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> would now be located, and a choice of a cassette tape changer with a separate single disc CD player later upgraded to a CD changer. Catering to Japanese tastes for luxury, the Leopard wasn't available in leather for all trim packages, with wool interior offered on the top three trim packages. The front passenger seat was also equipped with what Nissan called [...] "Partner Comfort Seat" [...] where the top portion of the front passenger seat was further articulated to tilt forward, supporting the passengers shoulders while allowing the seatback structure to recline. The front edge of the passenger seat cushion was also adjustable. This was created by Dr. Yoshiyuki Matsuoka who worked for Nissan starting in 1982.|$|E
30|$|Extensive {{studies have}} shown that the airbag {{deployment}} in load cases consists of two occupant loading phases: a punch-out effect where the airbag bursts out of its container with the airbag and airbag module cover accelerating towards the occupant and a second loading phase during which the airbag is taking on its deployed shape and volume (membrane-loading effect). Bankdak et al. (2002) developed an experimental airbag test system to study airbag-occupant interactions during close proximity deployment. The results provided insight for simulating the effect of inflation energy and mass flow on target response. Bedard et al. (2002) found that while left-side (driver-side) impacts accounted for only 13.5 % of all crashes, the fatality rate among these crashes was 68.3 % in comparison to front impact (48.3 %), right-side impact (31.3 %), and rear impact (38.4 %). These studies underscore the importance of occupant safety during side-impact collisions. In the last years, the current market requested to reduce the time and cost airbag development. In order to achieve this result, virtual simulations play an important role since they allow to minimize the number of experimental tests (Pei et al. 2013; Cao et al. 2014). Several simulation models of airbag were established (Wang et al. 2007). It is feasible to optimize the parameters of airbag deployment using simulation technology. Experimental and numerical studies have quantified injury risks to close-proximity occupants from deploying side airbags. These studies have focused on the prevention of the most adverse effects of airbag deployment (Duma et al. 2003). Other studies have proposed airbag characteristics to minimize particular biomechanical responses (Haland and Pipkorn 1996). In a more recent study, Marklund and Nilsson (2003) compared deformation patterns with experimental data as well as the computational costs associated with three different airbag deployment simulation methods; they concluded that the SPH method is relatively inexpensive and produces incremental deformation patterns that compare most closely to the experimental results. The process of inflation of an airbag is one of the determining factors in saving lives. The duration from the initial impact of the crash to the full inflation of an airbag is about 40 ¬†ms, and during this time, the airbag goes from being in a folded state to a fully inflated state, with a high internal pressure. After achieving this state, the airbag begins to deflate, thus providing a nice cushion for the body impacting it. Ideally, the person in the crash should come into contact with the airbag at this time. In the present study, a large volume <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> model is developed to handle different collision scenarios. The main aim is evaluate the performance of deploying of <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbag</b> using finite element methods (FEM).|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} safety kit includes driver, <b>passenger,</b> and <b>side</b> <b>airbags,</b> plus ABS {{brakes and}} seat belts that reduce chest injuries. The Cougar is well protected against theft and break in, {{due to an}} engine immobilizer, remote control central and double locking systems, and an alarm.|$|R
50|$|The MKS Concept {{seats were}} covered in cream-colored Aniline leather while the doors and {{interior}} panels {{were covered in}} pearl-white suede. The dashboard was covered in dark grey suede. Instrumentation and controls featured satin nickel inserts and chrome trim with backlighting provided by white LEDs. An applique of real maple wood ran across the instrument panel, dividing it into upper and lower sections. Features included Bluetooth device connectivity, a DVD-based navigation system, a 14-speaker, 500-watt audio system, a passive entry system that identifies the driver and allows starting the vehicle by carrying its key fob, and a push button ignition system. Safety was provided by dual front <b>airbags,</b> driver and <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> <b>airbags,</b> and <b>side</b> curtain <b>airbags.</b>|$|R
25|$|Depending on the {{equipment}} level, standard on some variants and optional on others, the facelifted Logan comes with driver, <b>passenger</b> and <b>side</b> <b>airbags.</b> In terms of active safety, all versions feature the latest generation Bosch 8.1 ABS, which incorporates EBD (electronic brakeforce distribution) and EBA (emergency brake assist).|$|R
