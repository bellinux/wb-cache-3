500|$|There {{are very}} many {{compound}} words containing yoga in Sanskrit. Yoga {{can take on}} meanings such as [...] "connection", [...] "contact", [...] "union", [...] "method", [...] "application", [...] "addition" [...] and [...] "performance". In simpler words, Yoga also means [...] "combined". For example, guṇáyoga means [...] "contact with a cord"; chakráyoga has a medical sense of [...] "applying a splint or similar instrument by means of pulleys (in case of dislocation of the thigh)"; chandráyoga has the astronomical sense of [...] "conjunction of the moon with a constellation"; puṃyoga is a grammatical term expressing [...] "connection or relation with a man", etc. Thus, bhaktiyoga means [...] "devoted attachment" [...] in the monotheistic Bhakti movement. The term kriyāyoga has a grammatical sense, meaning [...] "connection with a verb". But the same compound is also given a technical meaning in the Yoga Sutras (2.1), designating the [...] "practical" [...] aspects of the philosophy, i.e. the [...] "union with the supreme" [...] due to <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> in everyday life ...|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court, by a {{majority}} of five to two, decided that expert witnesses were not immune in the law of England and Wales from claims in tort or contract for matters connected with their participation in legal proceedings. This reversed a line of authority dating back 400 years. The case considered the narrow issue, namely whether preparation of a joint statement by experts was immune from suit, and the wider public policy issue of whether litigants should be able to sue experts that they had instructed for breach of duty. There was discussion about whether removing the immunity would have a [...] "chilling effect" [...] on the willingness of experts to participate in court proceedings, although judges {{on both sides of the}} decision agreed that there was no empirical evidence on the point. [...] Lord Phillips, a member of the majority, compared the situation of expert witnesses with that of advocates, on the basis that both owed duties to clients and to the court. [...] Advocates' immunity from claims in negligence had been removed in 2001 in Hall v Simons. [...] The change, he said, had not led to an increase in vexatious claims or a reduction in the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> owed by advocates to the court. [...] Lord Hope, in the minority, said that experts and advocates had different functions and so disagreed with the comparison. He also pointed out that English law would now be different from Scots law on this issue.|$|E

60|$|A {{man that}} pays {{money at the}} day appointed, {{beginning}} first at one shilling, or one pound, and so ceaseth not until he hath in current coin told over the whole sum to the creditor, does well at the beginning; but the first shilling, or first pound, not being the full debt, cannot be counted or reckoned the whole, but a part; yet is it not an imperfect part, nor doth the creditor find fault at all, because there is but so much now told; but concludes that all is at hand, and accepteth of this first, as a first-fruits: so Christ, {{when he came into}} the world, began to pay, and so continued to do, even until he had paid the whole debt, and so increased in favour with God. There was then a gradual <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties,</b> as to the number of them, by our Lord {{when he was in the}} world, and consequently a time wherein it might be said that Christ had not, as to act, done all, as was appointed him to do, to do as preparatory to that great thing which he was to do for us.

60|$|In the {{basement}} story {{at this hour}} Mr. Chickerel the butler, who had formed the subject of discussion on the floor above, was busily engaged in looking after his two subordinates as they bustled about in the operations of clearing away. He {{was a man of}} whom, if the shape of certain bones and muscles of the face is ever to be taken as a guide to the character, one might safely have predicated conscientiousness in the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties,</b> a thorough knowledge of all that appertained to them, a general desire to live on without troubling his mind about anything which did not concern him. Any person interested in the matter would have assumed without hesitation that the estimate his employer had given of Chickerel was a true one--more, that not only would the butler under all ordinary circumstances resolutely prevent his face from showing curiosity in an unbecoming way, but that, with the soul of a true gentleman, he would, if necessary, equivocate as readily as the noblest of his betters to remove any stain upon his honour in such trifles. Hence it is apparent that if Chickerel's countenance really appeared, as Neigh had asserted, full of curiosity with regard to the gossip that was going on, the feelings which led to the exhibition must have been of a very unusual and irrepressible kind.|$|E

60|$|Fourth. Another motive may be this: To grow in this {{grace of}} the fear of God, is the way to be kept always in a {{conscientious}} performance of Christian duties. An increase in this grace, I say, keeps every grace in exercise, and the keeping of our graces in their due exercise, produceth a conscientious <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties.</b> Thou hast a watch perhaps in thy pocket, but the hand will not as yet be kept in any good order, but does always give the lie as to the hour of the day; well, but what is the way to remedy this, but to look well to the spring, and the wheels within? for if they indeed go right, so will the hand do also. This is thy case in spiritual things; thou art a gracious man, and the fear of God is in thee, but yet for all that, one cannot well tell, by thy life, what time of day it is.[28] Thou givest no true and constant sign that thou art indeed a Christian; why, the reason is, thou dost not look well to this {{grace of the}} fear of God. Thou dost not grow and increase in that, but sufferest thy heart to grow careless, and hard, and so thy life remiss and worldly: Job's growing great in the fear of God made him eschew evil (Job 1, 2:3).|$|E
60|$|At {{the period}} of which we write, the then Chief of the London Fire Brigade, Mr Braidwood, had {{introduced}} a system of gymnastic training among the firemen, which he had found from experience to be a most useful exercise to fit the men for the arduous work they had to perform. Before going to London to take command of and reorganise the brigade which then went {{by the name of}} the London Fire-Engine Establishment, and was in a very unsatisfactory condition, Mr Braidwood had, for a long period, been chief of the Edinburgh Fire Brigade, which he had brought to a state of great efficiency. Taking the requirements and conditions of the service in Edinburgh into consideration, he had {{come to the conclusion that}} the best men for the work in that city were masons, house-carpenters, slaters, and suchlike; but these men, when at their ordinary employments, being accustomed to bring only certain muscles into full play, were found to have a degree of stiffness in their general movements which prevented them from performing their duty as firemen with that ease and celerity which are so desirable. To obviate this evil he instituted the gymnastic exercises, which, by bringing all the muscles of the body into action, and by increasing the development of the frame generally, rendered the men lithe and supple, and in every way more fitted for the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> in which their lives frequently depended on their promptitude and vigour.|$|E
6000|$|On other days, a man {{may be in}} and out of holy duties, and all in {{a quarter}} of an hour; but now, the Lord's day is, as it were, a day that enjoins to one {{perpetual}} duty of holiness. 'Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day'; which, by Christ, is not abrogated, but changed, into the first of the week, not as it was given in particular to the Jews, but as it was sanctified by him {{from the beginning of the}} world (Gen 2:2; Exo 31:13-17; Mark 16:1; Acts 20:7; 1 Cor 16:1,2; Mark 2:27,28; Rev 1:10); and therefore is a greater proof of the frame and temper of a man's heart, and does more make manifest to what he is inclined, than doth his other <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties.</b> Therefore, God puts great difference between them that truly call, and walk in, this day as holy, and count it honourable, upon the account that now they have an opportunity to show how they delight to honour him; in that they have not only an hour, but a whole day, to show it in (Isa 58:13). I say, he puts great difference between these, and that other sort that say, When will the Sabbath be gone, that we may be at our worldly business? (Amos 8:5). The first he calleth a blessed man, but brandeth the other for an unsanctified worldling. And, indeed, to delight ourselves in God's service upon his holy days, gives a better proof of a sanctified nature than to grudge at the coming, and to be weary of the holy duties of such days, as Mr. Badman did.[17] ...|$|E

6000|$|At the {{break-up}} {{of the great}} Rebellion I found myself at Selma, Alabama, still {{in the service of}} the United States, and although my duties were now purely civil my treatment was not uniformly so, and I am not surprised that it was not. I was a minor official in the Treasury Department, engaged in <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> exceedingly disagreeable not only to the people of the vicinity, but to myself as well. They consisted in the collection and custody of [...] "captured and abandoned property." [...] The Treasury had covered pretty nearly the entire area of [...] "the States lately in rebellion" [...] with a hierarchy of officials, consisting, as nearly as memory serves, of one supervising agent and a multitude of special agents. Each special agent held dominion over a collection district and was allowed an [...] "agency aide" [...] to assist him in his purposeful activity, besides such clerks, laborers and so forth as he could persuade himself to need. My humble position was that of agency aide. When the special agent was present for duty I was his chief executive officer; in his absence I represented him (with greater or less fidelity to the original and to my conscience) and was invested with his powers. In the Selma agency the property that we were expected to seize and defend as best we might was mostly plantations (whose owners had disappeared; some were dead, others in hiding) and cotton. The country was full of cotton which had been sold to the Confederate Government, but not removed from the plantations to take its chance of export through the blockade. It had been decided that it now belonged to the United States. It was worth about five hundred dollars a bale--say one dollar a pound. The world agreed that that was a pretty good price for cotton.|$|E
60|$|But {{what was}} to be done with the Duca? Rumours reached the Foreign Office that the {{infatuated}} young nobleman intended to adhere to his most unaristocratic position. The absurdity of a clerk of the third class in one of the branches of the Post Office, with a salary of a hundred and seventy a year, and sitting {{in the same room with}} Crockers and Bobbins while he would have to be called by everybody the Duca di Crinola, was apparent to the mind of the lowest Foreign Office official. It couldn't be so, they said to each other. Something must be done. If Government pay were necessary to him, could he not be transformed by a leap into the Elysium of their own department, where he might serve with some especial name invented for the occasion? Then there arose questions which no man could answer. Were he to be introduced into this new-fangled office proposed for him, would he come in as an Englishman or an Italian; and if as an Englishman, was it in accordance with received rules of etiquette that he should be called Duca di Crinola? Would it be possible in so special a case to get special permission from the Crown; or if not, could he be appointed to the Foreign Office as a foreigner? The special permission, though it was surrounded by so many difficulties, yet seemed to be easier and less monstrous than this latter suggestion. They understood that though he could not well be dismissed from the office which he already held, it might be difficult to appoint a foreign nobleman to the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> which certainly required more than ordinary British tendencies. In this way the mind of the Foreign Office was moved, and the coming of the young duke was awaited with considerable anxiety.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was not a}} devotional child. I have no {{recollection}} of early love [...] for the House of God and for divine service: though after my father [...] built the church at Seaforth in 1815, I remember cherishing a hope [...] that he would bequeath it to me, and that I might live in it. I have [...] a very early recollection of hearing preaching in St. George's, [...] Liverpool, but it is this: that I turned quickly {{to my mother and}} [...] said, 'When will he have done?' The Pilgrim's Progress undoubtedly [...] took a great and fascinating hold upon me, so that anything which I [...] wrote was insensibly moulded in its style; but it was by the force [...] of the allegory addressing itself to the fancy, and was very like a [...] strong impression received from the Arabian Nights, and from [...] another work called Tales of the Genii.
