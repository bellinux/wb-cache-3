5|$|Buildings {{and other}} {{structures}} were extensively damaged during the earthquake, but roadways and railways also experienced disturbances. Many case histories pertaining to liquefaction in sandy soil exist, but few exist {{with respect to}} gravel and gravelly sands. In certain situations gravelly sands may liquefy in similar fashion as saturated sands. The first well-documented case of liquefaction in gravelly sands was {{in regard to the}} 1983 Borah Peak earthquake in the United States. Several investigations of that event took place in the 1980s and early 1990s and the primary conclusions were that a critical condition for liquefaction to occur in that type of soil was the presence of a low permeable crust that did not allow <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> pressures to subside and that the assessment method and associated standard penetration test values used with sandy soils also applied to gravelly soils.|$|E
25|$|A {{state of}} 'soil liquefaction' {{occurs when the}} {{effective}} stress of soil is reduced to essentially zero, which corresponds to a complete loss of shear strength. This may be initiated by either monotonic loading (e.g. single sudden occurrence {{of a change in}} stress – examples include an increase in load on an embankment or sudden loss of toe support) or cyclic loading (e.g. repeated change in stress condition – examples include wave loading or earthquake shaking). In both cases a soil in a saturated loose state, and one which may generate significant <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> pressure on a change in load are the most likely to liquefy. This is because a loose soil has the tendency to compress when sheared, generating large excess porewater pressure as load is transferred from the soil skeleton to adjacent <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> during undrained loading. As <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> pressure rises a progressive loss of strength of the soil occurs as effective stress is reduced.|$|E

40|$|The most {{mobile and}} {{biological}} and chemically active fractions of trace metals in sediments are the dissolved components present in <b>pore</b> <b>waters.</b> Measuring metals in <b>pore</b> <b>waters</b> {{is complicated by}} the requirement for anoxic handling procedures. Due to the dynamic nature of sediment, steep concentration gradients extending over as little as 1 mm may develop at the sediment-water interface. New procedures for measuring metals in <b>pore</b> <b>waters</b> using polyacrylamide gels as in-situ probes are described. The gel can be used to establish a diffusive equilibration in a thin-film (DET). Because the film is typically less than 1 mm thick, equilibration is achieved within five minutes and insertion of the gel assembly causes minimal disturbance of sediment. An alternative procedure is to use a diffusive gradient in a thin-film (DGT), whereby a monolayer of chelating resin is incorporated at one side of the gel. Such a technique provides a kinetic measurement of labile species in solution. If the supply of metal from solid phase sediment to <b>pore</b> <b>waters</b> is fast enough, DGT provides a quantitative estimate of labile metal concentration. Alternatively, it measures directly the rate of supply of metal from solid phase to <b>pore</b> <b>waters.</b> As both DET and DGT are simple procedures capable of submillimetre spatial resolution, they provide previously unobtainable information on trace metal concentrations and fluxes. Furthermore, DGT {{has the potential to be}} used as a long-term monitor, providing mean concentrations of metals in sediment <b>pore</b> <b>waters</b> over periods of days, weeks, or even months...|$|R

We present {{concentrations}} of germanium and silicon in sediment <b>pore</b> <b>waters,</b> basaltic formation fluids, and bulk sediment from three ridge flank hydrothermal systems (RFHS). Basaltic formation fluids from warm (> 30 °C) RFHS have much higher Ge concentrations and Ge:Si molar ratios than overlying sediment <b>pore</b> <b>waters,</b> requiring seawater-basalt reactions to dominate Ge concentrations in basaltic formation fluids. In contrast to warm RFHS, cool (20 °C) RFHS have similar Ge concentrations in basal sediment <b>pore</b> <b>waters</b> and underlying basaltic formation fluids, implying {{that there is}} little net exchange between these two fluid reservoirs. Despite this low net exchange, Ge:Si molar ratios in basaltic formation fluids are elevated compared to seawater and overlying sediment <b>pore</b> <b>waters,</b> implying that seawater-basalt reactions must influence Ge and Si cycling. Such seawater-basalt reactions are likely associated with secondary clay formation because increases in Ge concentration scale with Mg loss from basaltic formation fluids. Processes that control Ge cycling in cold (3 – 10 °C) RFHS are poorly constrained because our data are restricted to sediment <b>pore</b> <b>waters</b> that have been overprinted by diagenetic reactions and possibly sampling artifacts. Although net Ge fluxes from RFHS prevail over a wide temperature range, a refined estimate for the global RFHS Ge flux is currently not possible without data from cold RFHS springs or basaltic formation fluids because cold RFHS transport most of the convective heat and crustal fluid to the oceans...|$|R

40|$|Toxicity {{identification}} of sediment <b>pore</b> <b>waters</b> from four {{sites in the}} Upper Scheldt (Belgium) was assessed using a simplified and discriminative toxicity identification evaluation procedure. The samples from all locations exhibited acute toxicity toward the freshwater crustacean Thamnocephalus platyurus. Toxicity was removed or considerably reduced by the cation exchange resins and air stripping at pH 11. In addition, the toxicity of the <b>pore</b> <b>waters</b> {{was found to be}} highly pH dependent. Increased toxicity was observed at higher pH levels, whereas reduced toxicity was found at lower pH levels. Based on these results, ammonia was suggested as the main toxic agent. The presence of ammonia concentrations exceeding the 24 -h median lethal concentration and comparison of the toxicity characterization profiles of the <b>pore</b> <b>waters</b> with those of the suspected toxicant supported this hypothesis. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation between the observed toxicity of the <b>pore</b> <b>waters</b> and the expected toxicity (due to the presence of the suspected toxicant) confirmed ammonia as the true toxic agent. Finally, the ratio between the expected ammonia toxicity and the observed toxicity from the characterization tests was approx. 1, meaning that all or most of the observed toxicity was caused by the presence of one toxicant (i. e., ammonia).

40|$|Sandy sediments of {{continental}} {{shelves and}} most beaches are {{often thought of}} as geochemical deserts because they are usually poor in organic matter and other reactive substances. The present study focuses on analyses of dissolved biogenic compounds of surface seawater and <b>pore</b> <b>waters</b> of Aquitanian coastal beach sediments. To quantitatively assess the biogeochemical reactions, we collected <b>pore</b> <b>waters</b> at low tide on tidal cross-shore transects unaffected by freshwater inputs. We recorded temperature, salinity, oxygen saturation state, and nutrient concentrations. These parameters were compared to the values recorded in the seawater entering the interstitial environment during floods. Cross-shore topography and position of piezometric level at low tide were obtained from kinematics GPS records. Residence time of <b>pore</b> <b>waters</b> was estimated by a tracer approach, using dissolved silica concentration and kinetics estimate of quartz dissolution with seawater. Kinetics parameters were based on dissolved silica concentration monitoring during 20 -day incubations of sediment with seawater. We found that seawater that entered the sediment during flood tides remained up to seven tidal cycles within the interstitial environment. Oxygen saturation of seawater was close to 100 %, whereas it was as low as 80 % in <b>pore</b> <b>waters.</b> Concentrations of dissolved nutrients were higher in <b>pore</b> <b>waters</b> than in seawater. These results suggest that aerobic respiration occurred in the sands. We propose that mineralised organic matter originated from planktonic material that infiltrated the sediment with water during flood tides. Therefore, the sandy tidal sediment of the Aquitanian coast is a biogeochemical reactor that promotes or accelerates remineralisation of coastal pelagic primary production. Mass balance calculations suggest that this single process supplies about 37 kmol of nitrate and 1. 9 kmol of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) to the 250 -km long Aquitanian coast during each semi-diurnal tidal cycle. It represents about 1. 5 % of nitrate and 5 % of DIP supplied by the nearest estuary...|$|R
