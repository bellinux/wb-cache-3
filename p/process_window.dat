50|$|Windows GUI {{programs}} are event-driven. After starting a <b>process,</b> <b>Windows</b> maintains an individual message queue for it. Windows places messages into that queue whenever mouse activity occurs on that <b>process's</b> <b>window,</b> whenever keyboard activity occurs while that <b>process's</b> <b>window</b> has focus, {{and at other}} times. A process can also add messages to its own queue. To accept user input, and for other reasons, each process must continuously retrieve messages from its queue, and act on them. A programmer makes the process do that by writing a loop that calls GetMessage (which blocks for a message and retrieves it), and then calls DispatchMessage (which dispatches the message), and repeats indefinitely. This is the message loop. It is usually part of the main program, which runs on the main thread. Messages for every <b>window</b> of the <b>process</b> pass through its message queue, and are handled by its message loop. A message loop is one kind of event loop.|$|R

2500|$|Assist {{features}} {{are often used}} to help balance asymmetry from non-telecentricity at different slit positions, due to different illumination angles, starting at the 7nm node. However, the asymmetry is reduced but not completely eliminated, since the assist features mainly enhance the highest spatial frequencies, whereas intermediate spatial frequencies, which also affect feature focus and position, are not much affected. The coupling between the primary image and the self images is too strong for the asymmetry to be completely eliminated by assist features; only asymmetric illumination can achieve this. Assist features may also {{get in the way}} of access to power/ground rails. Power rails are expected to be wider, which also limits the effectiveness of using assist features, by constraining the local pitch. Local pitches between 1x and 2x the minimum pitch forbid assist feature placement, as there is simply no room to preserve the local pitch symmetry. In fact, for the application to the two-bar asymmetry case, the optimum assist feature placement may be less than or exceed the two-bar pitch. Depending on the parameter to be optimized (<b>process</b> <b>window</b> area, depth of focus, exposure latitude), the optimum assist feature configuration can be very different, e.g., pitch between assist feature and bar being different from two-bar pitch, symmetric or asymmetric, etc..|$|E

30|$|Noise {{can occur}} during image capture, transmission, or {{processing}} phases. Image de-noising {{is a very}} important step in image processing, and many approaches are developed in order to achieve this goal such as the Gaussian filter which is efficient in noise removal. Its smoothing efficiency depends on the value of its standard deviation. The mask representing the filter presents generally static weights with invariant lobe. In this paper, an adaptive de-noising approach is proposed. The proposed approach uses a Gaussian kernel with variable width and direction called adaptive Gaussian kernel (AGK). In each <b>processed</b> <b>window</b> of the image, the smoothing strength changes according to the image content, noise kind, and intensity. In addition, the location of its lobe changes in eight different directions over the <b>processed</b> <b>window.</b> This directional variability avoids averaging details by the highest mask weights in order to preserve the edges and the borders. The recovered data is de-noised efficiently without introducing blur or losing details. A comparative study with the static Gaussian filter and other recent techniques is presented to prove the efficiency of the proposed approach.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} novel <b>process</b> <b>windows</b> has {{recently}} been proposed by Hessel (2009) and his major processing variant, the pressurised superheated processing, is the topic of several recent reviews in the field. Different from process intensification and micro-process technology enhancing mass and heat transfer to reveal intrinsic kinetics, novel <b>process</b> <b>windows</b> aim at speeding up kinetics, i. e. dramatically reducing reaction time. This idea is taken up {{more and more in}} micro-process technology, but origins as well from the encased processing practised since longer in microwave organic chemistry. Novel <b>process</b> <b>windows</b> as highly intensified processing approach tends to fully exploit the kinetics (reactivity) while maintaining selectivity at an acceptable level through use of harsh conditions, rather than to domesticate chemistry that is common practice in the process chemistry of the past. Reaction rates can be accelerated by orders of magnitude and reaction times shrink from hours to minutes and seconds. The accompanied large increase in productivity is a further cornerstone in making micro-process technology a competitive concept as opposed to the economics of scale, practised since decades in production chemistry aiming at increasing the vessel size more and more. Different to the content provided in recent reviews, this compilation focuses on the process chemistry potential of superheated processing (while still providing a short summary on the other processing options), a methodology how to find novel processing conditions and how to evaluate these. Two reactions, the Swern–Moffatt oxidation and the Claisen rearrangement, are discussed in detail, since these are ideal candidates for high-temperature investigations due to their eminent synthetic importance and well-known kinetics. As a practical reaction example with industrial guidance of a running European Project, the epoxidation of vegetable oils, the new methodology is exemplified beyond the level of the organic chemists’ descriptions given so far...|$|R
