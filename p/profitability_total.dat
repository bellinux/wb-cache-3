40|$|Increased {{dynamics}} and uncertainty in today’s supply chains require timely, accurate and relevant information to enable supply chain managers to make effective decisions. Traditional accounting practices are criticised as {{being unable to}} deliver this information. In the past decades various costing approaches like direct product <b>profitability,</b> <b>total</b> costs of ownership, target costing, and activity-based costing were introduced in order to add more meaning and relevance to existing practices. Benefits derived from the intra and inter organisational application of these practices are recognised. Even though, evidence shows that the adoption of these practices is still limited. This paper contributes to the {{better understanding of how}} to manage the inhibiting factors associated with the successful implementation of the aforementioned costing programmes in intra and inter-organisational context.

The evaluation of production efficiency made use of data obtained from the Lesy města Brna, a. s.

The results have confirmed an established hypothesis, namely that the decisive factor in the profitability of the production of forest energy wood chips hinges on the costs incurred in the gathering of raw material and the distribution of the produced chips. The results include a further limiting factor: transportation costs to the final consumption location. The output of the study is a recommendation that the concentration of residual forest materials not exceed a distance of 250 [*]m from the place of production to the point of disintegration and that the transport distance of energy chips not exceed 50 [*]km from the place of disintegration to the final consumption point.

In {{the theoretical}} part {{the core of}} collective investment and its development within the Czech Republic is solved. Next, there is a legislation modifying collective investment. The thesis also describes subjects of collective investment and a typology of funds. The practical part deals with com-parison of mutual funds; equity and bond funds. The timeframe chosen for this thesis is from 2010 to 2015. Funds are compared according to criteria such as volatility, <b>profitability,</b> <b>total</b> cost of the fund, {{the length of the}} history of the fund and net asset value. The thesis uses the monthly net asset value of each fund to calculate the return on an investment and the monthly profitability is used for a calculation of volatility. The best fund, from all chosen equity funds, was a fund Conseq Invest Akciový, which was one of the best in every criterion. The second best rated fund was AXA CEE Akciový. Another fund valuable to be mentioned is Spo-rotrend who was the worst one. In this case, the idea that the fund's long history does not speak of its future performance is confirmed.

Large-size enterprises (LSEs) form {{a small but}} vital part of Greek manufacturing and constitute {{a major component of}} the country's stock market. According to finance theory, the capital structure of a firm affects its capital cost and market value.

This has straightforward policy implications. Following recent economic developments, Greek firms are exposed to a stronger competition in the EU and global markets, but also to new opportunities. In order to improve their capital structure, Greek manufacturing LSEs need to achieve higher asset utilization and profit margins through economies of scale attained mainly by higher exports. Moreover, governmental measures aiming to support LSEs' efforts should focus their impact on alleviating taxation, reducing bureaucratic burdens, minimizing market imperfections and subsidizing applications of new technology. ...|$|R

We compare two outcome-based cost-sharing mechanisms, i. e., Quantity Proportional (QP) and Total Margin proportional (TM), with the more competitive Fixed Share (FS) mechanism where cost-sharing is set up on an ex ante basis. We show that outcome-based mechanisms, and even a fully collusive behavior induced by the optimal cost-sharing mechanism, might actually enhance total welfare {{as compared with the}} more competitive FS mechanism. We also find that, although the FS mechanism is never more preferable than the TM mechanism, it can lead to higher profits than the QP mechanism when competition is mild.

Duran’s method {{for the analysis of}} financial condition of domestic economic entities is explained by the following reasons: 1) the imperfection of the hierarchy of indicators of credit scoring, and 2) the imperfection of differentiation of scoring for the actual value of the indicators, forming the credit scoring by groups of firms. In the methodology of D. Duran the main indicator is a level of credit scoring <b>profitability</b> of <b>total</b> assets - for the first class of firms, that are the most financially stable, the authors have given a rating of " 50 points" for the actual value of the profitability of 30 %; the second most important indicator by the author’s choice is the ratio of current liquidity - for the actual value of the coefficient "of 2. 0 and higher," are given 30 points to a first-class firms; the third indicator of the financial condition of firms author has defined as the ratio of the financial independence - for the first group of firms the actual value of the coefficient "of 0. 7 and higher," are assessed 20 points. In the fifth, the last group of firms, numerical score is 0 (for the actual return on total assets "of less than 1 %", as the value of the current liquidity ratio "of 1. 0 or less," for the coefficient of financial independence "less than 0. 2 "). For assessment of the financial condition of the domestic agricultural producers, a priority in the hierarchy of indicators, in our opinion, has the ratio of financial independence, which is formed mainly by retained earnings.

The second most important in the assessment of the financial condition of the organization, in our opinion, is the <b>profitability</b> of <b>total</b> assets; its actual value "of 5 % and above" should correspond to score 30 points. The third in the system of indicators, characterizing the financial condition, is the ratio of current liquidity of the assets. Its actual value "of 3. 2 and above" should be evaluated in 20 points for the agricultural organizations of the first, most financially stable, grou...|$|R

After 10 days of the induced molting the lowest body weight loss (20. 01 %) was found in the B+F method (p 0. 05). Haugh unit of CONV group was better than NFR groups, whereas molting by NFR groups improved egg yolk color (p< 0. 001).

The research carried out was descriptive and predominantly quantitative in nature, carried out by means of analysis of panel data. The sample consisted of the 83 companies listed on the Novo Mercado of the BM&FBovespa during 2010 and 2011. The finding of a positive relationship between firm size and audit fees suggests that the larger the size of the audited company, the greater the audit workload and, thus, the greater the audit fees charged, confirming hypothesis 1 of the research. Contrary to research hypothesis, leverage showed a negative relationship, suggesting that less leveraged companies pay more audit fees. Finally, with respect to the <b>profitability</b> of <b>total</b> assets and Market-to-Book, no significant relationships were found, resulting in rejection of research hypotheses 2 and 3. It is concluded that size and leveraging are the factors that determine the external audit fees paid by the companies investigated.
