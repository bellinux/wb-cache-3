25|$|Consider {{the case}} of using gold as the source (mp = 1063°C). In this technique, the current through the {{filament}} of the pyrometer is adjusted until the light intensity of the filament matches that of a black-body at the melting point of gold. This establishes the <b>primary</b> <b>calibration</b> temperature and can be {{expressed in terms of}} current through the pyrometer lamp. With the same current setting, the pyrometer is sighted on another black-body at a higher temperature. An absorbing medium of known transmission is inserted between the pyrometer and this black-body. The temperature of the black-body is then adjusted until a match exists between its intensity and that of the pyrometer filament. The true higher temperature of the black-body is then determined from Planck's Law. The absorbing medium is then removed and the current through the filament is adjusted to match the filament intensity to that of the black-body. This establishes a second calibration point for the pyrometer. This step is repeated to carry the calibration to higher temperatures. Now, temperatures and their corresponding pyrometer filament currents are known and a curve of temperature versus current can be drawn. This curve can then be extrapolated to very high temperatures.|$|E

The set consists of five photovoltaic reference cells used to measure solar irradiance. Each cell has been calibrated multiple times by primary methods.

Taken together this allowed a rigorous determination of the assigned calibration value for each cell based on the weighted average, together with its uncertainty. This has led to unprecedented low uncertainties of 0. 23 % (k= 2), which are at least a factor of two smaller than achievable with any single <b>primary</b> <b>calibration.</b> Using these cells for calibrating secondary reference with a dedicated set-up leads to uncertainties for these secondary calibrated cells which is of the same order as the best <b>primary</b> <b>calibration</b> methods.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{concern in the}} {{literature}} about the methodology of using secondary calibration timepoints when estimating evolutionary divergence dates. Such timepoints are divergence time estimates that have been derived from one molecular data set {{on the basis of}} a <b>primary</b> external <b>calibration</b> timepoint, and which are then used independently on a second data set. Logically, the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>calibration</b> points must be mutually consistent, in the sense that it must be possible to predict each time point from the other. However, the attempt by Shaul and Graur (2002, Gene 300 : 59 - 61) to assess the reliability of secondary timepoints is flawed because they presented time estimates without presenting confidence intervals on those estimates, and so it was not possible to make any explicit hypothesis tests of divergence times. Also, they inappropriately excluded some of the data, which leads to a very biased estimate of one of the divergence times. Here, I present a re-analysis of the same data set, with more appropriate methodology, and come to the conclusion that no inconsistencies are involved. However, it is clear from the analysis that molecular data often have such large confidence intervals that they are uninformative, and thus cannot be used for reliable hypothesis tests.

40|$|Abstract − Primary {{accelerometer}} calibration {{is carried}} out {{under the assumption that}} a vibration exciter gives a rectilinear motion to an accelerometer to be calibrated. However practical vibration given by the vibration exciter includes parasitic motion such as transverse, rocking, and bending motion. The parasitic motion especially gives two serious effects on <b>primary</b> <b>calibration</b> results, transverse sensitivity effect and vibration distribution effect. Transverse sensitivity effect is caused by an inner product of the vectors of both transverse motion and transverse sensitivity. On the other hand, the vibration distribution effect is caused by motion disturbance and relative difference between acceleration at sensing point of accelerometer and at the spot sensed by the interferometer. These uncertainty sources have close interaction between vibration exciter and accelerometer, and close interaction between vibration exciter and the laser interferometer, respectively. Therefore, {{it is very difficult to}} estimate independently their uncertainty contribution. In this study, we propose simple methods to estimate uncertainty contribution due to these effects in the <b>primary</b> <b>calibration,</b> respectively. The proposed methods would enable more practical estimation of uncertainty budget...|$|E
