40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} new, robust {{discrete}} back-projection filtration algorithm to reconstruct digital images from close-to-minimal sets of arbitrarily oriented discrete projected views. The discrete projections {{are in the}} Mojette format, with either Dirac or Haar pixel sampling. The strong aliasing in the raw image reconstructed by direct back-projection is corrected via a de-convolution using the Fourier transform of the discrete point-spread function (PSF) that {{was used for the}} forward projection. The de-convolution is regularised by applying an image-sized digital weighting function to the raw PSF. These weights are obtained from the set of back-projected points that partially tile the image area to be reconstructed. This algorithm produces high quality reconstructions at and even below the Katz sufficiency limit, which defines a minimal criterion for projection sets that permit a unique discrete reconstruction for noise-free data. As the number of input discrete projected views increases, the PSF more fully tiles the discrete region to be reconstructed, the de-convolution and its weighting mask become progressively less important. This algorithm then merges asymptotically with the perfect reconstruction method found by Servières et al. in 2004. However the Servières approach, for which the PSF must exactly tile the full area of the reconstructed image, requires O(N²) uniformly distributed projection angles to reconstruct N×N data. The independence of each (back-) <b>projected</b> <b>view</b> makes our algorithm robust to random, symmetrically distributed noise. We present, as results, images reconstructed from sets of O(N) <b>projected</b> <b>view</b> angles that are either uniformly distributed, randomly selected, or clustered about orthogonal axes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{relationship}} between the orientation and curvature of projected curves and the orientation and curvature of the underlying space curve has been previously established. This has allowed a disambiguation of correspondences in two views and a transfer of these properties to a third view for confirmation. We propose that a higher-order intrinsic differential geometry attribute, namely, curvature derivative, is necessary {{to account for the}} range of variation of space curves and their projections. We derive relationships between curvature derivative in a <b>projected</b> <b>view,</b> and curvature derivative and torsion of the underlying space curve. Regardless of the point, tangent, and curvature, any pair of curvature derivatives are possible correspondences, but most would lead to very high torsion and curvature derivatives. We propose that the minimization of third order derivatives of the reconstruction, which combines torsion and curvature derivative of the space curve, regularizes the process of finding the correct correspondences. ...|$|E

In this research, we have developed new algorithms that utilize the programmability of GPUs to evaluate machinability of free-form surfaces. The method runs in real time on fairly inexpensive hardware (<$ 600), and performs well regardless of the surface type.

40|$|We {{present the}} results from {{analyzing}} the physical and morphological properties of 154 dimmings (transient coronal holes) and the associated flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Each dimming in our 2013 catalog was processed with the semi-automated Coronal Dimming Tracker using Solar Dynamics Observatory AIA 193 A observations and HMI magnetograms. Instead of the typically used difference images, we used our coronal hole detection algorithm to detect transient dark regions "directly" in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images. This allowed us to study dimmings as the footpoints of CMEs - {{in contrast with the}} larger, diffuse dimmings seen in difference images that represent the <b>projected</b> <b>view</b> of the rising, expanding plasma. Studying the footpoint-dimming morphology allowed us to better understand the CME structure in the low corona. While comparing the physical properties of dimmings, flares, and CMEs we were also able to identify relationships between the different parts of this complex eruptive phenomenon. We found that larger dimmings are longer-lived, suggesting that it takes longer to "close down" large open magnetic regions. Also, during their growth phase, smaller dimmings acquire a higher magnetic flux imbalance (i. e., become more unipolar) than larger dimmings. Furthermore, we found that the EUV intensity of dimmings (indicative of local electron density) correlates with how much plasma was removed and how energetic the eruption was. Studying the morphology of dimmings (single, double, fragmented) also helped us identify different configurations of the quasi-open magnetic field. Comment: [URL]...|$|E

40|$|We report ALMA {{observations}} of polarized dust emission from the protostellar source Ser-emb 8 at a linear resolution of 140 au. Assuming models of dust-grain alignment hold, the observed polarization pattern gives a <b>projected</b> <b>view</b> {{of the magnetic}} field structure in this source. Contrary to expectations based on models of strongly magnetized star formation, the magnetic field in Ser-emb 8 does not exhibit an hourglass morphology. Combining the new ALMA data with previous observational studies, we can connect magnetic field structure from protostellar core (80, 000 au) to disk (100 au) scales. We compare our observations with four magnetohydrodynamic gravo-turbulence simulations made with the AREPO code that have initial conditions ranging from super-Alfvénic (weakly magnetized) to sub-Alfvénic (strongly magnetized). These simulations achieve the spatial dynamic range necessary to resolve the collapse of protostars from the parsec scale of star-forming clouds down to the 100 au scale probed by ALMA. Only in the very strongly magnetized simulation do we see both {{the preservation of the}} field direction from cloud to disk scales and an hourglass-shaped field at < 1000 au scales. We conduct an analysis of the relative orientation of the magnetic field and the density structure in both the Ser-emb 8 ALMA observations and the synthetic {{observations of}} the four AREPO simulations. We conclude that the Ser-emb 8 data are most similar to the weakly magnetized simulations, which exhibit random alignment, in contrast to the strongly magnetized simulation, where the magnetic field plays a role in shaping the density structure in the source. In the weak-field case, it is turbulence [...] not the magnetic field [...] that shapes the material that forms the protostar, highlighting the dominant role that turbulence can play across many orders of magnitude in spatial scale.

40|$|International audienceSpatial {{settings}} {{are more and}} more present in organizational and management studies looking the interactions of space and organizations (Clegg, Kornberger, 2006). The study of workspaces organization, for example, has become a remarkable way to analyze organization modalities and practices (Van Marrewijk, Yanow, 2010). This study proposes to introduce the notion of projection by analyzing a viable link between spatial settings and visual dimension in organization (Meyer, al., 2013). By this approach, the paper will question the role of images during organization construction processes. Images – as places – are known to be the foundation of the art of memory (Yates, 1966), a way for the organization of thought (Quattrone, 2009). The idea is to interrogate the possibility for images to project action. The paper's aim is to analyze the role of visual artifacts during spatial organization design. More specifically, we will focus on the uses of images (maps, models, drawings) in order to represent organizational actions during identity construction processes. Research question: How can visual artifacts be used as an instrument for the construction of an organizational identity during spatial design processes? An investigation through maps, models and drawings. Methodology and case study: The paper proposes to study the use of maps, models or drawings as "visual language" by the political discourse (Kress, Van Leeuwen, 1996) in order to give projections of the future organization of the Campus of Paris-Saclay in France. The French State's intention at Saclay is to group on the same territory several institutions {{in order to create a}} new university and to promote the scientific cooperation between some of the best French higher education institutions, public research and the economic world. Based on Spicer and Tyler typology (2007), the paper takes a <b>projected</b> <b>view</b> of the territory (macro level). From a large focus based on « pre-existing » maps, models and drawings, we will use an archeological approach (Meyer and. al. 2013) to collect the data. The collection of these visuals artifacts allows to investigate and trace several points of view according to actors dynamics in situation of institutional change (Battilana, Leca, Boxenbaum, 2009). As an example, the scientific project management at Saclay uses a map (Figure. 1), which represents the grouping on the same territory -through the use of logos-of all institutions involved in the project...|$|E
