30|$|Most of {{the above}} studies {{considered}} the dynamics of driven rollers in the models but the behavior of idle rollers was ignored. Consequently, the models were under some limited conditions, which ignored detailed complex tension dynamics. On the other hand, most research focused on dynamic modeling and control strategy design, but the mechanical structure {{and the influence of}} parameter variation on fiber tension were ignored. In this paper, a novel tension control method is presented, which can regulate the tension and speed of the filament winding process. The mechanical structure and dynamic model of the system are established, and the influences of the parameter and the speed variation on fiber tension are examined. Subsequently, according to the features of driven rollers and the influence of variation, the control method is proposed by regulating the outputs of the torque of unwind roll, the torque of magnetic <b>powder</b> <b>brake</b> roller, and the speed of the master speed roller in three levels. Simulations are conducted for verifying the effect by comparing the results with those of the conventional PID controller. Finally, the performance of the proposed control system is verified through experimental studies using a filament winding machine.|$|E

If the battery life is too short, the frequently replacement of the battery is necessary, which will increase the overall cost. This article presents a novel hybridization design and implementation {{of an air}} motor and an electric motor which utilizes magnetic <b>powder</b> <b>brake</b> to integrate these two motors together. In this research, by the use of batteries, operation in the large discharge region can be avoided and more electric energy can be saved using an air motor as the auxiliary power. The testing results obtained using the proposed experimental platform indicate that the output current of the battery is 126 A with no air motor-assisted power, and the output current is 64 A when the pre-set switching point is 1400 r/m. These results clearly show that the current reduction is about 49 %, and thus the service life of the batteries can be greatly increased.

Parts of the gearing have been created by means of FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling). The input data come from 3 D CAD solid model which geometry is determined by a file of any system equipped with the ability to save in STL format. This model is described by a grid of triangles and divided into levels (layers). Their thickness determines the accuracy of representation of a detail curvature. The thickness of the layers is also limited by the accuracy of the process and the equipment.

With the continuous improvement of product quality and efficiency, the precision of the tension control system is constantly improving. In this paper, a novel tension control method is proposed, which can regulate the fiber tension and transport speed of the winding process by governing the outputs of three different driven rollers (the torque of the unwind roll, the torque of the magnetic <b>powder</b> <b>brake</b> roller, and the speed of the master speed roller) in three levels. The mechanical structures and dynamic models of the driven rollers and idle rollers are established by considering the time-varying features of the roller radius and inertia. Moreover, the influence of parameters and speed variation on fiber tension is investigated using the increment model. Subsequently, the control method is proposed by applying fiber tension in three levels according to the features of the three driven rollers. An adaptive fuzzy controller is designed for tuning the PID parameters online to control the speed of the master speed roller. Simulation is conducted for verifying the performance and stability of the proposed tension control method by comparing with those of the conventional PID control method. The result reveals that the proposed method outperforms the conventional method. Finally, an experimental platform is constructed, and the proposed system is applied to a winding machine. The performance and stability of the tension control system are demonstrated via a series of experiments using carbon fiber under different reference speeds and tensions. This paper proposes a novel tension control method to regulate the fiber tension and transport speed.|$|E

40|$|Micro-hydropower plants (MHP) {{give the}} best {{solution}} to the power needs of rural and small communities which serve as decentralized power source to meet the local population requirement. Energy requirements for lighting, cooking, heating, drying, agro-processing and other small scale industrial activities can be met through these MHPs in the most reliable way {{in the rural areas}} of the country like Nepal. Cross- flow turbines are used widely in such MHPs due to their simple design, easier maintenance, low initial investment and modest efficiency. Also, because of their suitability under low heads, their efficient operation under a wide range of flow variations and ease of fabrication, cross- flow turbines have been extensively employed. 	The research work comprises of both experimental studies and numerical investigation of the cross- flow turbine. Experiments are conducted in dedicated test rig available in Fluid Engineering Laboratory of Korea Maritime and Ocean University (KMOU). With robust computer technologies and design developments, a CFD based study on the design, performance characteristics, flow analyses and design optimization are carried out in this study work. A previously made test rig (Hyosung Ebara Engineering Company, South Korea, 2009) was reviewed and maintained to conduct the experiments. 	During the experiment, pump provides the required head and the flow through the turbine. Electro-magnetic flow meter and pressure transducer at the upstream side are used for the flow rate and pressure measurement respectively. The turbine was coupled to <b>powder</b> <b>brake</b> through torque meter and the required parameters were recorded in the data logger. Experiments were conducted at various rpm and flow rates. For numerical simulation, two phase (air & water at 25 째C) steady state with SST turbulence model was selected in the commercial CFD code ANSYS CFX 13. 0. The design parameters include 10 m head, 0. 1 m 3 /s flow rate and 642 rotational speed. Numerical results obtained from the simulation were compared with the experimental results. Several major parameters that affect the cross-flow turbine efficiency were studied and design modifications were done to enhance the turbine performance. 	In order to enhance the efficiency of the turbine, various design modifications have been proposed and evaluated numerically. Nozzle shape modification, guide vane angle variation, blade numbers variation, air layer insertion, casing length and diffuse angle variation were done simultaneously during the process and finally the optimized design was proposed. Velocity distribution, pressure contours, output torque etc. in the flow domain and the several stages of flow inside the runner were also characterized.
