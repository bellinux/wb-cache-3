500|$|In <b>Paris's</b> Roman era, {{its main}} {{cemetery}} was located to {{the outskirts of}} the Left Bank settlement, but this changed with the rise of Catholicism, where most every inner-city church had adjoining burial grounds for use by their parishes. With <b>Paris's</b> growth many of these, particularly the city's largest cemetery, les Innocents, were filled to overflowing, creating quite unsanitary conditions for the capital. When inner-city burials were condemned from 1786, the contents of all <b>Paris's</b> parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated section of <b>Paris's</b> stone mines outside the [...] "Porte d'Enfer" [...] city gate, today place Denfert-Rochereau in the 14th arrondissement. The process of moving bones from Cimetière des Innocents to the catacombs took place between 1786 and 1814; part of the network of tunnels and remains can be visited today on the official tour of the catacombs.|$|R
