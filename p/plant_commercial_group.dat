40|$|Introduction - The genus Echinacea (Asteraceae) {{comprises}} about 10 species originally {{distributed in}} North America. Three species {{are very well}} known as they are used worldwide as medicinal plants: Echinacea purpurea, E. pallida, E. angustifolia. Objective - To discriminate between these three Echinacea species and E. simulata by (1) H NMR-based metabolomics. Methodology - (1) H NMR and multivariate analysis techniques were applied to diverse Echinacea plants including roots and aerial parts, authentic <b>plants,</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>plants</b> and <b>commercial</b> dry extracts. Results - Using the (1) H NMR metabolomics, it was possible, without previous evaporation or separation steps, to obtain a metabolic fingerprint to distinguish between species. Conclusion - A clear distinction between the three pharmaceutical species was possible and some useful metabolites were identified. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Yttria-stabilized tetragonal {{zirconia}} polycrystals (Y-TZP) is {{used for}} dental prosthodontics, however, it can present accelerated tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation in oral environment. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the behavior of a Y-TZP synthesized in laboratory by the coprecipitation method to a commercial Y-TZP, after hydrothermal aging in pressurized reactor (150 o C / 35 hours). The discs were sintered at 1520 o C for two hours. The kinetics curve of phase transformation was determined through the data collect by XRD diffractograms treated by the Rietveld method. The experimental and <b>commercial</b> control <b>groups</b> did not present monoclinic phase. After 35 hours of aging, the experimental group presented 69 % of monoclinic phase compared to 67 % for the <b>commercial</b> <b>group.</b> Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy images suggested that the <b>commercial</b> <b>group</b> presented heterogeneity o...|$|R
