40|$|Two {{groups of}} 25 patients, one with <b>pseudospondylolisthesis</b> (PSL) {{and the other}} without, have been {{compared}} in order to verify the impression that arthrosis of the hands occurs more fre-quently in those with PSL. The observed differences were significant, being especially marked in women in whom five or more hand joints were involved and increasing in frequency with age. No relation was found between PSL and either discarthrosis or being overweight. The presence of PSL can probably {{be included in the}} pattern of generalized osteoarthrosis described by Kellgren and Lawrence (1958). ARTHROSIS of the proximal (PIP) and distal (DIP) interphalangeal joints occurs predomi-nantly in women, and previous studies have suggested that it is in part genetically deter-mined (Stecher, 1955). <b>Pseudospondylolisthesis</b> (PSL), which is associated with arthrosis of the posterior interapophyseal joints, appears almost exclusively in women, as was shown in a previous study by Rotes Querol, Roig Escofet, and Ferreiro (1967). In that study the impression was gained that patients with PSL also showed more arthrosis of the hands than would be expected. We thought {{it would be interesting to}} verify this impression on an objective basis...|$|E
40|$|In 1854 Kilian first {{described}} as spondylolisthesis the condition {{then known as}} luxation of the lumbo-sacral joint. The terms prespondylolisthesis, <b>pseudospondylolisthesis,</b> retrolisthesis, retrospondylolisthesis, spondyloptosis and spondylolysis have since been introduced {{and much of the}} argument surrounding the subject has been semantic. Confusion has also arisen from the belief that spondylolisthesis must have a single cause. Early writers found a defect in the pars interarticularis of affected vertebrae, whereas Neugebauer (1888) found the arch intact but elongated. The existence of a defect in the pars interarticularis slowly came to be accepted, and disagreement shifted to its cause, some authors believing it a congenital error of development while others held it to be a fracture. Meyerding (193 1, 1938) found evidence of defects of the pars interarticularis in many patients with low back pain and stated that spondylolisthesis was far commoner than had been thought, many cases passing without diagnosis. He also suggested that men were affected more often than women, the reverse of previous reports. These differences were partly reconciled by Capener in 1932 when he pointed out the existence of two distinct types of spondylolisthesis, one with a defect in the pars interarticulari...|$|E
