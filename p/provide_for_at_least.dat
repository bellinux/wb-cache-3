25|$|Gene {{nomenclature}} {{and protein}} nomenclature are not separate endeavors; they are {{aspects of the}} same whole. Any name or symbol used for a protein can potentially {{also be used for}} the gene that encodes it, and vice versa. But owing to the nature of how science has developed (with knowledge being uncovered bit by bit over decades), proteins and their corresponding genes have not always been discovered simultaneously (and not always physiologically understood when discovered), which is the largest reason why protein and gene names do not always match, or why scientists tend to favor one symbol or name for the protein and another for the gene. Another reason {{is that many of the}} mechanisms of life are the same or very similar across species, genera, orders, and phyla, so that a given protein may be produced in many kinds of organisms; and thus scientists naturally often use the same symbol and name for a given protein in one species (for example, mice) as in another species (for example, humans). Regarding the first duality (same symbol and name for gene or protein), the context usually makes the sense clear to scientific readers, and the nomenclatural systems also provide for some specificity by using italic for a symbol when the gene is meant and plain (roman) for when the protein is meant. Regarding the second duality (a given protein is endogenous in many kinds of organisms), the nomenclatural systems also <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> human-versus-nonhuman specificity by using different capitalization, although scientists often ignore this distinction, given that it is often biologically irrelevant.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the initial}} three-issue series a Kickstarter {{campaign}} was run {{to create a}} [...] "full-cast video comic" [...] of the series. The intent was {{to raise money for}} not only the video, but also to fund new issues of the comic. At the close of the campaign, Taylor announced that enough money had been raised to <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 8 new issues of the series.|$|E

50|$|In 1979 Iraq {{initiated}} contacts {{aimed at}} closer alignment {{at a time}} when the newly established President Saddam Hussein was seeking Arab allies, perhaps to <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> some level of transnational support and inter-Arab legitimacy for his régime. More important for the Jordanians, however, were the economic pay-offs of such an alliance, as Iraq could provide economic support and oil supplies that the kingdom desperately needed.|$|E
50|$|Certain Microsoft {{products}} such as SQL Server and Exchange can interfere with the operation of a domain controller, necessitating isolation of these products on additional Windows servers. Combining them can make configuration or troubleshooting of either the domain controller or the other installed software more difficult. A business intending to implement Active Directory is therefore recommended to purchase a number of Windows server licenses, to <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> two separate domain controllers, and optionally, additional domain controllers for performance or redundancy, a separate file server, a separate Exchange server, a separate SQL Server, and so forth to support the various server roles.|$|E
50|$|Elected to the 18th National Assembly in June 2008, Song {{now serves}} on the Foreign Affairs, Trade & Unification Committee. As a new member of the National Assembly, he has been {{promoting}} legal reforms that address important foreign policy challenges, such as improving Korea's Official Development Assistance (ODA) policies and streamlining procedures for a more rapid deployment of Korean UN PKO forces. Another major area of interest has been the settlement of North Korean defectors in South Korea who are currently not receiving adequate vocational training. As a corrective, Song has proposed that current laws mandating an eight-week training period be revised to <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one year of diversified and specialized training programs.|$|E

5000|$|The gimlet (pronounced {{with a hard}} 'g') is a {{cocktail}} made of gin and lime juice. A 1928 description of the drink was: [...] "gin, a spot of lime, and soda". The description in the 1953 Raymond Chandler novel The Long Goodbye stated that [...] "a real gimlet is half gin and half Rose's lime juice and nothing else". This {{is in line with}} the proportions suggested by The Savoy Cocktail Book (1930) which specifies one half Plymouth Gin and one half Rose's Lime Juice Cordial. However, modern tastes are less sweet, and generally <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> two parts gin to one part of the lime and other non alcoholic elements (see recipes below).|$|E
5000|$|With {{any system}} of taxation, it is {{possible}} to shift or recharacterize income in a manner that reduces taxation. Jurisdictions often impose rules relating to shifting income among commonly controlled parties, often referred to as transfer pricing rules. Residency-based systems are subject to taxpayer attempts to defer recognition of income through use of related parties. A few jurisdictions impose rules limiting such deferral ("anti-deferral" [...] regimes). Deferral is also specifically authorized by some governments for particular social purposes or other grounds. Agreements among governments (treaties) often attempt to determine who should be entitled to tax what. Most tax treaties <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> a skeleton mechanism for resolution of disputes between the parties.|$|E

40|$|The next {{parliamentary}} elections in Poland {{will be held}} {{on the basis of the}} amended elec- toral law. The changes introduced involve a quota system: the ballots are required to <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 35 % of women and at least 35 % of men. Nearly a hundred years passed from 1918, when Polish women first won voting rights, till the President of Poland signed the so-called parity law. It would not be true, however, to say that this was a century of struggle for the equality of rights of men and women in our country. It was only after 1989 that efficient steps could be taken in this area in Poland. Therefore, the quota system that has been introduced, to be tested in practice soon, is actually the consequence of twenty years of endeavors. The advo- cates of such a solution consider this to be the first step towards electoral parity. Following the solutions that numerous European countries have introduced, public debate in Poland increasingly more often refers to proposals to ‘spread’ the quota system, and then parity, also to other domains, such as management or education. The opening of a serious de- bate on these issues will to a large extent depend on the results of the recent quota changes of the electoral law...|$|E
40|$|When Sam Schuman and Anne Ponder {{recruited}} Chris Dahl {{and me to}} {{join them}} in developing an “Undergraduate Summit” which might bring together representatives of the major higher education associations, they billed our roles as “conversation starters. ” I hope our remarks do just that, not offering fixed conclusions but sparking conversation among those who’ve joined us {{at the table in}} Chicago and among those who might become acquainted with the Summit later on. It is more than the accident of friendship that brought us together to get a larger conversation underway. Though all four of us are now leading college and university campuses of different kinds, we came from Honors program backgrounds, and this has colored our thoughts and perhaps even explains why we believe that a broader conversation about undergraduate education today is important. Ostensibly, Honors programs (or, increasingly, “colleges”) are meant to enrich, to challenge, and to meet the differing needs for intellectual stimulation among the members of diverse student bodies. But I think that few of us who have been involved in Honors education have failed to observe that in too many instances they seem intended to “salvage” the quality of an undergraduate degree for a fortunate minority—to <b>provide</b> (<b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> those chosen and electing to take part) engaged, participatory learning, close interaction with “real” professors, intellectual community, and opportunities to try a hand at independent scholarship. Where this is, in fact, the case, it is a sad commentary on the state of a baccalaureate education—where it takes a “special” program to deliver to some students what ought to be in the experience of all. To note this takes nothing away from the dedicated Honors program administrators and faculty who conduct the programs. It only recognizes that in such settings they are swimming against the tide in their home institutions rather than with it, beating against the current for the best of reasons...|$|E
5000|$|The years {{following}} {{the end of the war}} led to even greater demands for public housing in Canberra. Facing building supply shortages and ever-increasing demand for accommodation, alternate methods of housing construction were investigated. The ACT Advisory Council recommended that [...] "temporary housing in the form of rebuilt Army huts be <b>provided</b> <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 100 families, subject to it being assumed as a government responsibility that these huts be replaced by housing of adequate standard at a later stage.". Hostels were erected near modern-day Commonwealth Park, Reid, Kingston and Barton. The hostels were built using ex-military buildings moved from Narellan near Sydney and Mulwala in the Riverina.|$|R

30|$|It is {{important}} to note that peri-operative antibiotics were <b>provided</b> <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 99  % of our cohort, and we had no recorded septic arthritis or superficial wound infections. Conjecture regarding why antibiotics were provided could range from thoughtful utilization because implants were utilized to mere system-based prophylaxis related to “Pay for Performance” measures. Unfortunately, with multiple surgeons involved, it is unclear as to the actual reason antibiotics were administered. It is interesting to note that perhaps blind utilization of antibiotics is not without risk, since a couple of the minor complications were directly related to the antibiotic or cleaning of the skin during surgical preparation. Furthermore, no DVT prophylaxis was utilized (mechanical or pharmacologic) and no evidence of thromboembolic event was recorded.|$|R
