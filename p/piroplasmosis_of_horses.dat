40|$|RESUME. 1. <b>Piroplasmosis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>horse</b> is {{a disease}} with periods also {{pronounced}} by physical-chemical alterations of blood and serum. 2. The haemolysis, produced by the intra-globular parasites, has to {{be considered to be}} the cause of a great number of physical-chemical symptoms of the serum, for the latter depend in several points {{on the state of the}} blood corpuscles. 3. Volume of blood corpuscles, viscosity, and specific gravity of the blood all decrease. Never was an increase of the viscosity noticed; contrary to what is observed in horse-sickness. 4. Viscosity, specific gravity, conductivity, and surface tension of serum also decrease, the latter especially in the beginning of the disease. The osmotic pressure of serum decreases in every instance; in four cases out of six an increase precedes, and can amount even to more than 100 per cent. The specific gravity decreases in four instances and increases in two instances. 5. Physical-chemical alterations emphasise themselves by the methods in use before the temperature starts to rise (conductivity the first day, depression of freezing point, viscosity, surface tension, and specific gravity). Therefore, if we call incubation period the time between infection and the appearance of the first signs of the disease, it would be in some of our cases <b>of</b> <b>piroplasmosis</b> not more than twenty-four hours (2840, 2841); in other cases (3260, 3248, 3249), about four days; that is to say, much shorter than when only considering the appearance of fever. 6. The physical-chemical alterations of the urine are not typical and regular, like those of serum and blood; some of them are extraordinary, all show dependence on the state of the serum and demonstrate again the regulatory functions of the kidneys.

40|$|Summary The aim of {{this work}} was to {{elaborate}} a literary study and evaluate interdisciplinary aspects <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> breeding, mainly aspects legal and economic.

The part Importance <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> shows the economic, agricultural, sporting, cultural, military and medical significance <b>of</b> <b>horses.</b> The part Legal regulation <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> breeding describes in details circumstances of the origin <b>of</b> unions <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> breeders. The acceptance of laws No. 240 / 1991 Sb. and No. 154 / 2000 Sb. has been mentioned as well.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{focuses on}} the legal {{regulation}} <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> breeding. It analyses and describes the applicable legislation in the Czech Republic, evaluates its shortcomings and suggests possible improvements. At the same time, the thesis connects {{the description of the}} legal regulation with best practise examples. The legislation <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> breeding is mostly represented within public law, but it can be found also in private law, making the orientation on this topic much more difficult. The knowledge of legislation and their provision to the widest possible range of people plays the key assumption for the better following of regulations. Despite the annual increase <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> in the Czech Republic, less attention is paid to this area. The diploma thesis consists of nine chapters, which are divided for simplicity into subchapters. The first chapter creates an introduction. It refers to the development and changes in the use <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> in the Czech Republic and it sets goals of the thesis. In the chapter two, the legal status <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> is defined in both, private and public law. The third chapter consists <b>of</b> legislation <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> breeding, taking evidence and labelling <b>of</b> <b>horses.</b> It highlights the shortcomings associated with the labelling <b>of</b> <b>horses.</b> The fourth chapter describes the legislation on protection of [...] ...|$|R

But overcoming shortage <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> themselves was insurmountable: a work horse matures in three to four years; farm stocks were already depleted <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> as well as tractors. Western European nations, starting with the United Kingdom, witnessed shortage <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> since the 1920s and adjusted their armies accordingly.

40|$|For several decades, {{the origin}} <b>of</b> {{domestic}} <b>horses</b> {{has been the}} focus of research across multiple disciplines, yet many aspects <b>of</b> the <b>horse</b> domestication process remain poorly understood. One of the reasons for the difficulty in establishing a coherent scenario <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> domestication is that archaeological, mtDNA, and Y chromosome data have yielded ambiguous results, possibly because each class of markers reflects different aspects of the domestication process. In this thesis, I use large autosomal genetic datasets from horses sampled across Eurasia to investigate the origin and spread <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> domestication. I begin by characterising genetic diversity <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> from the Eurasian steppes and neighbouring regions, thus laying the groundwork for a more thorough analysis into the demographic history <b>of</b> <b>horses.</b> I then investigate the origin and mode <b>of</b> spread <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> domestication in the Eurasian steppe region using a spatially explicit genetic model. I show that horse domestication was initiated in the western part of the steppes, and that the spread <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> domestication involved both movement of domestic herds and extensive recruitment <b>of</b> wild <b>horses</b> from across this vast region, a scenario which integrates both archaeological and molecular evidence. Having established the route of spread <b>of</b> early domestic <b>horses</b> out <b>of</b> their domestication origin in the western steppe, I go on to investigate the routes and levels of gene flow among Eastern Eurasian horse populations post-domestication. I show that the ancient Silk Roads have played an important role in shaping the genetic structure <b>of</b> Eastern Eurasian <b>horses,</b> facilitating gene flow across deserts and high mountain chains. Finally, I provide further compelling evidence for the persistence <b>of</b> wild <b>horses</b> in the Iberian Peninsula throughout the Holocene period, and the substantial contribution of these local populations to the gene pool <b>of</b> Iberian domestic <b>horses.</b> Together, my results provide a coherent picture of the origin and spread <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> domestication, integrating for the first time previous evidence from archaeology, mtDNA and Y chromosome sequence data...|$|R
