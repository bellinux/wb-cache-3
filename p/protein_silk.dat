An insoluble <b>protein,</b> <b>silk</b> fibroin and glue-like protein, sericin, {{combined to}} form the silk. It is composed of three components: heavy (H) chain fibroin (350  kDa), light (L) chain fibroin (25  kDa) and P- 25 protein in a molar ratio of 6 : 6 : 1, respectively. Structural analysis of the H-chain possesses two types of molecular conformations being α- and β-helix. The former is non-crystalline and soluble in water while the later is highly stable organized and insoluble in water (Motta et al. 2002). Silk I is mainly formed of α-helix sheets, while that containing {{a higher percentage of}} β-helix is termed silk II (Inoue et al. 2000).|$|E

However, compared to Bombyx mori silk, commonly known as mulberry silk, the other non-mulberry silks have some drawbacks like coarseness, low draping, wash and wear characteristics etc. which can be changed using chemical treatment. In this study, effects of some highly polar, non-polar and bipolar solvents on fibre of muga silk have been studied in terms of tensile strength. Methanol and Phenol treated fiber showed higher tensile strength than DMSO, Formaldehyde, Toluene, DMF, Benzene, Ethanol and THF treated fibres respectively.

The necessary volatility for mass-spectrometric examination of the peptides was achieved by permethylation of the N-acetyl-peptide methyl ester derivatives. From the mass spectra it was possible to confirm the known sequences and to establish that of the partially known one.

40|$|Arthropods face {{several key}} {{challenges}} in processing concentrated feedstocks of <b>proteins</b> (<b>silk</b> dope) into solid, semi-crystalline silk fibres. Strikingly, independently evolved lineages of silk-producing organisms have {{converged on the}} use of liquid crystal intermediates (mesophases) to reduce the viscosity of silk dope and assist the formation of supramolecular structure. However, the exact nature of the liquid-crystal-forming-units (mesogens) in silk dope, and the relationship between liquid crystallinity, <b>protein</b> structure and <b>silk</b> processing is yet to be fully elucidated. In this review, we focus on emerging differences in this area between the canonical silks containing extended-β-sheets made by silkworms and spiders, and ‘non-canonical’ silks made by other insect taxa in which the final crystallites are coiled-coils, collagen helices or cross-β-sheets. We compared the amino acid sequences and processing of natural, regenerated and recombinant <b>silk</b> <b>proteins,</b> finding that canonical and non-canonical <b>silk</b> <b>proteins</b> show marked differences in length, architecture, amino acid content and <b>protein</b> folding. Canonical <b>silk</b> <b>proteins</b> are long, flexible in solution and amphipathic; these features allow them both to form large, micelle-like mesogens in solution, and to transition to a crystallite-containing form due to mechanical deformation near the liquid–solid transition. By contrast, non-canonical <b>silk</b> <b>proteins</b> are short and have rod or lath-like structures that are well suited to act both as mesogens and as crystallites without a major intervening phase transition. Given many non-canonical <b>silk</b> <b>proteins</b> can be produced at high yield in E. coli, and that mesophase formation is a versatile way to direct numerous kinds of supramolecular structure, further elucidation of the natural processing of non-canonical <b>silk</b> <b>proteins</b> may to lead to new developments in the production of advanced protein materials...|$|R

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{overcome}} the shortcomings of the existing membranes by developing new barrier membrane from silk <b>protein.</b> <b>Silk</b> is a natural macromolecule originating from Bombyx mori that mainly consists of two proteins, fibroin and sericin [12 – 15]. Fibroin is the structural center of silk, with a specific fibroin layer giving the silk tensile strength. The high glycine and alanine content in silk fibroin leads to tightly packed beta membranes, resulting in rigidity and tensile strength [15]. Silk fibroin can increase alkaline phosphatase activity and type I collagen expression in MG 63 cells [16]. As both proteins are bone formation marker, silk fibroin has been widely used as a scaffold for bone graft [12]. The first silk barrier membrane was produced by electrospinning, which requires a large facility for mass production [17]. However, silk fibroin film was found to be fragile and dissolved easily in aqueous solution when it was used a barrier membrane [18].|$|E

In particular, biopolymers are suitable materials as nanoparticles for clinical application due to their versatile traits, including biocompatibility, biodegradability and low immunogenicity. Biopolymers are polymers that are produced from living organisms, which are classified in three groups: polysaccharides, proteins and nucleic acids.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of a novel silk production system in a marine amphipod provides insights into the wider potential of natural silks. The tube-building corophioid amphipod Crassicorophium bonellii produces from its legs fibrous, adhesive underwater threads that combine barnacle cement biology with aspects of spider silk thread extrusion spinning. We characterised the filamentous silk as a mixture of mucopolysaccharides and protein deriving from glands representing two distinct types. The carbohydrate and <b>protein</b> <b>silk</b> secretion is dominated by complex β-sheet structures and a high content of charged amino acid residues. The filamentous secretion product exits the gland through a pore near {{the tip of the}} secretory leg after having moved through a duct, which subdivides into several small ductules all terminating in a spindle-shaped chamber. This chamber communicates with the exterior and may be considered the silk reservoir and processing/mixing space, in which the silk is mechanically and potentially chemically altered and becomes fibrous. We assert that further study of this probably independently evolved, marine arthropod silk processing and secretion system can provide not only important insights into the more complex arachnid and insect silks but also into crustacean adhesion cements...|$|E

30|$|Silk fiber {{consists}} of two main proteins, fibroin and sericin. Fibroin is the structural protein and sericin is a glue like protein surrounding the fibroin <b>protein.</b> <b>Silk</b> fibers are conglutinated with a non-woven structure by sericin bonding matrix. This structural strategy must have evolved for a protective function to safe guard {{the development of the}} pupa within the silkworm cocoons, which have additional composite materials to augment the protection. Through evolutionary pressures over millions of years, cocoons have optimized their composite structure to function for the full development of silkworm pupa in the process of metamorphosis to moths. This process varied from few weeks to several months depending on the types of cocoons. During this time, cocoons are exposed {{to a wide range of}} threats such as physical attack from animals, birds or insects including bacteria. Besides, such composite structure of cocoons protect the pupa inside from harsh environmental conditions. It is of interest to understand how silk cocoon membrane performs such activity based on their porous structure, mechanical strength, and its potential for control of the gaseous environment and temperature inside.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigated}} whether elevated host immune capacity can inhibit T. gondii infection. For this purpose, we used silk protein extracted from Bombyx mori cocoons {{as a natural}} supplement to augment immune capacity. After silk protein administration to BALB/c mice for 6 weeks, ratios of T lymphocytes (CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cells) and splenocyte proliferative capacities in response to Con A or T. gondii lysate antigen (TLA) were increased. Of various cytokines, which regulate immune systems, Th 1 cytokines, such as IFN-γ, IL- 2, and IL- 12, were obviously increased in splenocyte primary cell cultures. Furthermore, the survival of T. gondii (RH strain) -infected mice increased from 2 days to 5 or more days. In a state of immunosuppression induced by methylprednisolone acetate, silk protein-administered mice were resistant to reduction in T-lymphocyte (CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cells) numbers and the splenocyte proliferative capacity induced by Con A or TLA with a statistical significance. Taken together, our results suggest that silk protein augments immune capacity in mice and the increased cellular immunity by silk protein administration increases host protection against acute T. gondii infection.
