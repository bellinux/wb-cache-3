40|$|The {{target of}} this {{bachelor}} work is processing of literature searche on the topic: Question of <b>perfluorinated</b> <b>compounds</b> in environmental compartments. The most important substances {{of the group}} of <b>perfluorinated</b> <b>compounds</b> are perfluorooctyl sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). <b>Perfluorinated</b> <b>compounds</b> have special physical and chemical properties, which make them valuable for usage in different industrial branches. These properties, which make them so useful are also the reason, why they are so harmful for the environment. The perfluoroalkyl chain is not affected by photolysis, hydrolysis or biodegradation. PFOS and PFOA are very persistent in the environment. The presence of the PFOS have been detected in liver, blood, muscle, kidney or brain of many animal species including the invertebrates over fish, amphibians, birds, mammals up to human being all over the world. An alarming fact is, that the high concentrations of PFOS have been found in arctic animals tissues far away from anthropogenic sources. Improved analytical techniques enabled scientists to take interest in <b>perfluorinated</b> <b>compounds</b> in more detail, which led to the identification of quite a number of these compounds. Nowadays there is an endeavour to eliminate the application of perfluorinated chemicals and replace them gradually by other compounds, which are better degradable and do not affect the environment...|$|R
50|$|If a <b>per{{fluorinated}}</b> <b>compound</b> has a fluorinated tail, {{but also}} a few non-fluorinated carbons (typically two) near the functional group, it is called a fluorotelomer (such molecules are commercially treated as perfluorinated), but such molecules are more of industrial value than chemical. The chain end may similarly be attached to different functiuonal groups (via the hydrogenized terminal carbon), such as hydroxyl resulting in fluorotelomer alcohols, sulfonate resulting in fluorotelomer sulfonates, etc.|$|E
50|$|In addition, PFOSA {{is thought}} to be the biologically active form of the {{insecticide}} Sulfluramid (N-ethyl perfluorooctanesulfonamide)as it is an extremely potent uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylationwith an IC50 of about 1 micromolar (â‰ˆ500 nanograms per milliliter or parts per billion).

Bischel et al. [79] also confirmed the high affinity interactions between perfluorinated compounds and serum albumin, in particular at low molar ratios. PFOS and PFOA are primarily extracellular and accumulate primarily in the liver, blood serum, and kidneys. Small amounts of the substances are found in other tissues as well. According to studies by Austin et al. [107] and Seacat et al. [108], the liver to serum ratio for PFOS is about 2.5.

40|$|Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is an {{important}} <b>perfluorinated</b> <b>compound</b> (PFC) with various applications and has been widely disseminated in the environment, wildlife, and humans. The present study investigated the effects of waterborne PFOA on the expression of hepatic estrogen-responsive genes, vitellogenin (VTG), and estrogen receptor P (ER beta) and on the gonadal development in a freshwater rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus). The mRNA levels of VTG and ER beta were determined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques, and VTG protein levels were identified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A significant increase of VTG expression in the livers of both mature males and females was observed after 14 and 28 d of exposure to 3, 10, and 30 mg/L PFOA, indicating that PFOA could induce VTG synthesis. The expression of ERP increased significantly in livers of both mature males and females after a 14 -d exposure, although no difference was observed after a 28 -d exposure. The development of oocytes in testes exposed to PFOA also provided evidence of estrogenic activity in males. The ovaries of PFOA-exposed females underwent degeneration, as reported in other fish species exposed to environmental estrogens. This preliminary study indicates that PFOA can disturb the activity of estrogen in mature male rare minnows by inducing hepatic estrogen-responsive genes, VTG and ER beta, and barrier female reproduction...|$|E

The CF(3) -containing compounds measured by this method and discussed here are: the <b>perfluorinated</b> <b>compound,</b> C(3) F(8) (FC 218); four perhalogenated compounds, CF(3) Cl (CFC 13), CF(3) CF(2) Cl (CFC 115), CF(3) CFCl(2) (CFC 114 a), and CF(3) Br (Halon 1301); and three hydrofluorocompounds, CF(3) H (HFC 23), CF(3) CH(3) (HFC 143 a), and CF(3) CH(2) F (HFC 134 a). For four of these compounds, very few measurements have been previously reported. The atmospheric {{concentrations of}} all of the CF(3) -containing compounds continuously increased in time over the sample collection periods.

40|$|In this study, dendronization and {{grafting}} via controlled polymerization techniques, atom transfer {{radical polymerization}} (ATRP) and ring-opening polymerization (ROP), have been explored. Modification of surfaces and cellulose using these techniques, which enable grafting of well-defined polymer architectures, has been investigated. The interest in using cellulose stems from its renewability, biocompatibility, high molecular weight, and versatile functionalization possibilities. Dendronization was performed using disulfide-cored didendrons of 2, 2 -bis(methylol) propionic acid (bis-MPA) on gold surfaces, {{for the formation}} of self-assembled monolayers. It was found that the height of the monolayer increased with increasing dendron generation and that the end-group functionality controlled the wettability of the modified surface. Superhydrophobic cellulose surfaces could be obtained when a â€˜graft-on-graftâ€™ architecture was obtained using ATRP from filter paper after subsequent post-functionalized using a <b>perfluorinated</b> <b>compound.</b> The low wettability could be explained by a combination of a high surface roughness and the chemical composition. Biobased dendronized polymers were synthesized through the â€˜attach toâ€™ route employing dendronization of soluble cellulose, in the form of hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC). The dendronized polymers were studied as nanosized objects using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and {{it was found that the}} dendron end-group functionality had a large effect on the molecular conformation on surfaces of spun cast molecules. ATRP of vinyl monomers was conducted from an initiator-functionalized HPC and an initiator-functionalized first generation dendron, which was attached to HPC. The produced comb polymers showed high molecular weight and their sizes could be estimated via AFM of spun cast molecules on mica and from dynamic light scattering in solution, to around 100 - 200 nm. The comb polymers formed isoporous membranes, exhibiting pores of a few micrometers, when drop cast from a volatile solvent in a humid environment. HPC was also used to initiate ROP of Îµ-caprolactone, which was chain extended using ATRP to achieve amphiphilic comb block copolymers.
