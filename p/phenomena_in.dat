5|$|In September 1894, C. T. R. Wilson was {{employed}} at the observatory {{for a couple}} of weeks as temporary relief for one of the permanent staff. During this period, he witnessed a Brocken spectre and glory, caused by the sun casting a shadow on a cloud below the observer. He subsequently tried to reproduce these <b>phenomena</b> <b>in</b> the laboratory, resulting in his invention of the cloud chamber, used to detect ionising radiation.|$|E

The manifestation of the mind-stream is also described as being influenced by physical laws, biological laws, psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.|$|E
5|$|Colony {{collapse}} disorder (CCD) is {{the phenomenon}} {{that occurs when}} the majority of worker bees in a colony disappear and leave behind a queen, plenty of food and a few nurse bees {{to care for the}} remaining immature bees and the queen. While such disappearances have occurred throughout the history of apiculture, and were known by various names (disappearing disease, spring dwindle, May disease, autumn collapse, and fall dwindle disease), the syndrome was renamed colony collapse disorder in late 2006 in conjunction with a drastic {{rise in the number of}} disappearances of western honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies in North America. European beekeepers observed similar <b>phenomena</b> <b>in</b> Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, Switzerland and Germany, albeit to a lesser degree, and the Northern Ireland Assembly received reports of a decline greater than 50%.|$|E
5|$|Groups share a {{fundamental}} kinship {{with the notion}} of symmetry. For example, a symmetry group encodes symmetry features of a geometrical object: the group consists of the set of transformations that leave the object unchanged and the operation of combining two such transformations by performing one after the other. Lie groups are the symmetry groups used in the Standard Model of particle physics; Poincaré groups, which are also Lie groups, can express the physical symmetry underlying special relativity; and point groups are used to help understand symmetry <b>phenomena</b> <b>in</b> molecular chemistry.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that the {{universe}} is well described by four-dimensional spacetime, there are several reasons why physicists consider theories in other dimensions. In some cases, by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions, a theory becomes more mathematically tractable, and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily. There are also situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful for describing <b>phenomena</b> <b>in</b> condensed matter physics. Finally, there exist scenarios in which there could actually be more than four dimensions of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection.|$|E
5|$|Night clouds or {{noctilucent clouds}} are tenuous cloud-like <b>phenomena</b> <b>in</b> the upper atmosphere. They {{are made of}} ice {{crystals}} and are only visible in a deep twilight. Noctilucent roughly means night shining in Latin. They are most commonly observed in the summer months at latitudes between 50° and 70° {{north and south of}} the equator. These clouds can be observed only during local summer months and when the Sun is below the horizon for the observer, but while the clouds are still in sunlight.|$|E
5|$|One {{early and}} {{influential}} theory of scientific explanation is the deductive-nomological model. It {{says that a}} successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the <b>phenomena</b> <b>in</b> question from a scientific law. This view {{has been subjected to}} substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory. It is especially challenging to characterize what is meant by an explanation when the thing to be explained cannot be deduced from any law because {{it is a matter of}} chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained. Others have argued that the key to a good explanation is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.|$|E

He developed a particular interest in {{the far side of the}} Moon, a small part of which is visible from Earth as a result of the Moon's libration; the Moon was his specialist subject throughout his life. He claimed to have discovered and named the Mare Orientale (Eastern Sea) in 1946, along with Hugh Percy Wilkins, though he later conceded that German astronomer Julius Heinrich Franz should be credited with the discovery. The feature had been observed several times since telescopic observations began. Moore described the short-lived glowing areas on the lunar surface, and gave them the name transient lunar <b>phenomena</b> <b>in</b> 1968.|$|E
