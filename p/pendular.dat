25|$|The {{trigonometric}} functions {{are also important}} in physics. The sine and the cosine functions, for example, are used to describe simple harmonic motion, which models many natural phenomena, such as the movement of a mass attached to a spring and, for small angles, the <b>pendular</b> motion of a mass hanging by a string. The sine and cosine functions are one-dimensional projections of uniform circular motion.|$|E
25|$|In Portugal the Pendolino {{is named}} Alfa <b>Pendular</b> and is {{operated}} by the Portuguese state railway company CP. It connects the cities of Braga, Porto, Aveiro, Coimbra, Santarém, Lisbon, Albufeira and Faro, among others, and has {{a top speed of}} 220km/h (136.7mph). The bogies had to be redesigned for operation on Portugal's broad gauge track, and the trains were assembled by Adtranz Portugal at the Amadora plant (former Sorefame).|$|E
25|$|The M1000 has 40 wheels (215/75R 17.5 tires) across five axle lines, {{these with}} two {{half-width}} axles per line. Each axle has hydraulic <b>pendular</b> suspension providing a 254mm stroke with lateral oscillation accommodating surface undulations. A hydraulic suspension system is also provided on the pivoting gooseneck to equalise fifth wheel loads. Weight of the M1000 is 22,882kg. Payload {{according to the}} U.S. Army is 63,560kg, although the manufacturer quotes 80,000kg at reduced speeds. Overall length is 15.8 m, deck length is 10.58 m; deck width is 3.05 m, 3.66 m for a wide deck version.|$|E
25|$|The Shinkansen {{has used}} the {{electric}} multiple unit configuration from the outset, with the 0 Series Shinkansen having all axles powered. Other railway manufacturers were traditionally reluctant, or unable to use distributed traction configurations (e.g. Talgo used the locomotive configuration with the AVE Class 102 and continues with it for the Talgo AVRIL {{on account of the}} fact that it is not possible to use powered bogies as part of the Talgo <b>Pendular</b> system). In Japan, significant engineering desirability exists for the electric multiple unit configuration. A greater proportion of motored axles results in higher acceleration, meaning that the Shinkansen does not lose as much time if stopping frequently. Shinkansen lines have more stops in proportion to their lengths than high-speed lines elsewhere in the world.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} first Pendolino EMU was built in Italy, in 1972, Fiat and RENFE signed an {{agreement}} for cooperation in tilting-train development. The first fruit of the cooperation was the equipment of a RENFE Class 432 EMU with the active tilting suspension in September 1972. After successful tests, Spanish trainmaker Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles and Fiat built a prototype similar to the ETR 401, which was delivered in 1976 as RENFE Class 443, nicknamed Platanito (Banana) for its yellow livery. The four-car train had a commercial top speed of 180km/h and achieved a then speed record for Spain of 206km/h on 6 May 1987. However, the train remained a unique specimen, as RENFE favoured the entirely domestic Talgo <b>Pendular,</b> a tilting train with passive suspension introduced in 1980. After revenue service in 1979-1982, the train was used for charter and test runs.|$|E
500|$|The tram {{consists}} of two stations and a single intermediate tower. Two tram cars operate in a <b>pendular</b> mode on parallel track ropes and are pulled in unison by a haul rope which is driven by an engine at the lower terminal; when one car is at the upper terminal, the other is at the lower terminal, and vice versa.
