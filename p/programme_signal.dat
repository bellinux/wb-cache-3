40|$|Objective: Midwife-led {{care has}} {{consistently}} {{been found to}} be safe and effective in reducing routine childbirth interventions and improving women’s experience of care. Despite consistent UK policy support for maximising the role of the midwife as the lead care provider for women with healthy pregnancies, implementation has been inconsistent and the persistent use of routine interventions in labour has given rise to concern. In response the Scottish Government initiated Keeping Childbirth Natural and Dynamic, a maternity care programme that aimed to support normal birth by implementing multi-professional care pathways and making midwife-led care for healthy pregnant women the national norm. Design: The evaluation was informed by realist evaluation. It aimed to explore and explain {{the ways in which the}} KCND programme worked or did not work in different maternity care contexts. Methods: The evaluation was conducted in three phases. In phase one semi- structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with key informants to elicit the programme theory. At phase two, this theory was tested using a multiple case study approach. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted and a case record audit was undertaken. In the final phase the programme theory was refined through analyses and interpretation of the data. Setting and participants: The setting for the evaluation was NHS Scotland. In phase one, 12 national programme stakeholders and 13 consultant midwives participated. In phase two case, studies were undertaken in three health boards; overall 73 participants took part in interviews or focus groups. A case record audit was undertaken of all births in Scotland during one week in two consecutive years before and after pathway implementation. Findings: Government and health board level commitment to, and support of, the <b>programme</b> <b>signalled</b> its importance and facilitated change. Consultant midwives tailored change strategies, using different approaches in response to the culture of care and inter-professional relationships within contexts. In contexts where practice was already changing KCND was seen as validating and facilitating. In areas where a more medical culture existed there was strong resistance to change from midwives and medical staff and robust implementation strategies were required. Overall the pathways appeared to enable midwives to achieve change. Key conclusions: Our study highlighted the importance of those involved in a change programme working across levels of hierarchy within an organisation and from the macro-context of national policy and institutions to the meso-context of regional health service delivery and the micro-context of practitioner’s experiences of providing care. The assumptions and propositions that inform programmes of change, which are often left at a tacit level and unexamined by those charged with implementing them, were made explicit. This examination illuminated the roles of the three key change mechanisms adopted in the KCND programme - appointment of consultant midwives as programme champions, multidisciplinary care pathways, and midwife-led care. It revealed the role of the commitment mechanism, which built on the appointment of the local change champions. The analysis indicated that the process of change, despite these clear mechanisms, needed to be adapted to local contexts and responses to the implementation of KCND. Implications for practice: Initial formative evaluation should be conducted prior to development of complex healthcare programmes to ensure that 1. The interventions will address the changes required 2. Key stakeholders who may support or resist change are identified 3. Appropriate facilitation strategies are developed tailored to context...|$|R
40|$|Key {{features}} of the kinetics of T lymphocyte proliferative responses are remarkably insensitive {{to the nature of}} the antigenic stimulus. This consistency suggests the presence of an antigen-independent mechanism regulating T cell clonal expansion. Knowledge of such a mechanism could allow us to modulate T helper cell (CD 4 +) and cytotoxic T cell (CD 8 +) responses more effectively. Using a simple mathematical model of T cell proliferation and death, we investigate a variety of plausible mechanisms and compare the model predictions to experimental data from the literature. We find that irrespective of the details of the mechanism, rates of apoptosis must progressively increase to control a T cell response. If apoptosis is mediated by cell–cell contact this alone is sufficient to regulate both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell responses. Proliferation of both T cell subsets can also be regulated by an internal <b>programme,</b> by cytokine <b>signalling,</b> or by an APC-mediated route.

40|$|The goal of cost effective, high {{performance}} optical systems capable of pattern matching tasks has fuelled research {{for over two}} decades. It is only recently {{with the introduction of}} novel optical/electronic architectures that such systems are becoming viable. Although conceptually elegant, the single output from an optical correlator is of restricted application due to its sensitivity to image distortions. A multichannel hybrid optical/electronic architecture has therefore been devised, exhibiting greatly enhanced flexibility and performance. This hybrid processor is being used in conjunction with a robotic handling system as part of an ESPRIT <b>programme.</b> The video <b>signal</b> from a robot's TV camera is relayed to an electrically addressed spatial light modulator in the processor. This input image is then replicated optically and fed into each of the system's parallel channels where it is cross-correlated with a set of differing reference patterns. The multiple correlation signals are detected and compiled into an electronic descriptor code. A 'Euclidean' search through a look-up table of codes then extracts object identification and rotation.

40|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) and integrins collaborate to regulate gene expression associated with cell growth, differentiation and survival. Biochemical and molecular analyses of integrin signalling pathways have uncovered several critical cytoplasmic proteins that link the ECM and integrins to intracellular pathways that {{may contribute to}} anchorage-dependent growth. A large body of evidence now indicates that the non-receptor protein kinases focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and specific members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including the extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), mediate these ECM- and integrin-derived signalling events. However, {{little is known about}} how FAK and MAPKs contribute to biological processes other than cell proliferation or migration. In addition, remarkably little is known concerning the signalling events that occur in cells that adhere to complex multivalent extracellular matrices via multiple integrin receptors.

However, the recent discovery that members of the Rho family of small GTPases are able to regulate ECM/integrin pathways that modulate both cell shape and intracellular signalling provides new insights into how cell morphology and signal transduction become integrated, especially within three-dimensional differentiated tissues...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development and manufacture of a fluidic variable event control system for turret lathes, which can be programmed to give any desired tool-slide length of travel in increments of 0. 001 inch. The system consists of pneumatic-hydraulic machine actuating cylinders, fitted with sensors to provide machine information, and a control cabinet containing the logic, counter, address and programme systems. Control of events, such as the engagement of the cross-slide, change of feed etc., have been related to the ram-slide motion; fluid displaced from the ram-slide actuating cylinder is metered into either a storage tank or slave cylinders in the control cabinet which, repeat and amplify the motion. Sensing units fitted to the slave cylinders, are programmed to inform the Logic System when the machine slide has travelled the required distance for an event, which initiates command signals to the address system. Programming a selection of events, their sequence and distance to be travelled by a tooling arrangement is achieved by sing multi-channel selector units. Each unit has six programme channels and controls and event, such as the rate of feed for each turret face. On receipt of a start <b>signal,</b> <b>programme</b> channel number 1 of each selector unit is energised, turret face number 1 is presented to the component material and the events programmed take place. When the sequence of operations for that turret face have been completed, the slides return to their starting point. Indexing of the turret to present face number 2 energises programme channel number 2 to control events for this face. This process is repeated until turret face number 6 and programme channel number 6 has been used; the component has now been completed and the cycle is repeated. The programme is not pre-determined such as when using plug board, punched card or tape, and can be varied by shop floor personnel adjusting the programme selector units while the machine is in operation. This feature not only enables component lengths to be adjusted, but as the choice of such events as speed, feed, or when to start the cross-slide may be varied to suit the actual working conditions, optimum production performance is more readily achieved...|$|R
40|$|Mammalian cell {{cultures}} are nowadays adopted as industrial platforms for monoclonal antibody (mAb) manufacture. Although improving product quality and expression stability becomes predominant these days, enhancement in mAb production still {{remains one of}} the greatest challenges facing the industrial biotechnology community. One of reasons behind this is the synthesis of mAb is restricted by the decline phase occurring in the mammalian cell cultures as a result of cell death. Prolongation of culture viability via suppression of cell death appears as a potential strategy to improve mAb production and productivity. Understanding of cell death in the mammalian cell cultures is, therefore, crucial to the improvement of the strategy toward mAb production and productivity enhancement. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is found to be the major cause of culture viability loss in the mammalian cell cultures. It is a highly-organised physiological process of cell death that can be triggered through activation of the genetic <b>programme</b> underlying a <b>signal</b> cascade that governs particular morphological and physiological changes in response to extracellular and intracellular stimuli. In order to devise strategies to optimise degrees of apoptosis in the mammalian cell cultures, understanding of apoptosis is inevitable. However, to establish the understanding of apoptosis is an extremely challenging task given the complexity arising from the dynamic nature of apoptosis and its association with internal and external milieu, including other cellular processes and environmental conditions. This thesis presents a combined experimental and modelling approach for a study of apoptosis in GS-NS 0 cell cultures, aiming to identify relevant metabolic stresses, evaluate their impact on apoptosis induction, and investigate kinetics of apoptosis in response to the identified stresses. The novelty of this study is a systemic view of apoptosis where apoptosis is studied in accordance with dynamic changes in culturing conditions, as well as cell proliferation and metabolic activities. Batch culture experiments of GS-NS 0 cell line demonstrate interplay between apoptosis and other cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and metabolism. In addition, the batch cultures allow evaluating impact of metabolic stresses and culture conditions on induction of apoptosis. Fed-batch culture experiments help validate links between apoptosis and metabolic stresses as suggested based on the batch cultures, and also shed some light on feeding strategies for a delay in apoptosis induction. The first-principles mathematical model for apoptosis in the GS-NS 0 cell cultures demonstrates a good reproduction of the experimental data. Model analysis reveals model characteristics through global parameter sensitivities and helps guide further model modification toward development of a predictive apoptosis mathematical model.
