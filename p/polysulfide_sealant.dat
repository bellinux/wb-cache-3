5000|$|On June 10, 2009, Jetstar Airways Flight 20 {{flying from}} Kansai International Airport to Gold Coast Airport {{experienced}} {{a small fire}} in the cockpit apparently caused by a fault in the heating system. The fire was quickly extinguished by the pilots who subsequently diverted the plane to Guam. All 203 people on board were unharmed in the incident. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau determined {{the cause of the}} fire to be an overheat related to the use of a <b>polysulfide</b> <b>sealant</b> in the electrical connections to the windshield.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} sealing {{method has}} been developed for the exposed metal fastener surfaces of the Solid Rocket Booster vehicle for the Space Shuttle launch system. The method employs properly sized flexible plastic caps filled with catalyzed <b>polysulfide</b> <b>sealant,</b> frozen and stored. At the time of use, the caps and sealant are thawed and positioned on the fasteners. The sealant covers the exposed portion of the fastener and prevents salt water damage. The method is one of high reliability with low installation and inspection costs...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of an}} {{anti-corrosive}} primer {{has been}} shown to be essential to assure survival of a bonded structure in a hostile environment, particularly if a stress is to be applied to the adhesively bonded joint during the environmental exposure. For example, the Lockheed L- 1011 TriStar assembly, after exhaustive evaluation tests specifies use of chromate filled inhibitive <b>polysulfide</b> <b>sealants,</b> and use of corrosion inhibiting adhesive primers prior to structural bonding with film adhesive...|$|R
40|$|Joints {{consisting}} of glass bonded with <b>polysulfide</b> <b>sealants</b> have been aged at 95 % relative humidity and 60 -degrees-C {{for up to}} 14 months. All were weakened and some {{with higher levels of}} plasticizer fell apart during exposure. The amount of interfacial failure increased with exposure, and was related to a discolouration which develops in the sealant and can be seen through the glass. The rate of joint weakening is greater than can be accounted for by the rate at which water diffuses into the sealant. Thermodynamic predictions based on measurements of contact angles show that the bonds are probably unstable in the presence of water...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Manganese (IV) oxide phases are widely used as curing agents for <b>polysulfide</b> <b>sealants.</b> The manganese based curing agents, however, do not give a reproducible cure and this results in material waste. As the market for insulating glass applications is increasing, efficient curing becomes more significant both commercially and environmentally. The research described in this portfolio focuses on using a laboratory synthesised manganese (IV) oxide phase, sodium birnessite, as a polysulfide curing agent. The synthesis and full characterisation of sodium birnessite is described and its curing ability {{measured in terms of}} the following properties of the cured polysulfide: rate of cure. surface condition, hardness build-up, stress-strain data, low and high temperature properties. and moisture transmission. The results obtained are compared with those of polysulfides cured with a good commercial product. Different concentrations of curing agents, and types and concentrations of accelerators, plasticisers and inert diluents were investigated to optimise the curing process, reduce material use and product wastage. Sodium birnessite is an active and reliable curing agent when used at half of the concentration of the commercial agent in the presence and absence of inert diluents. Diluted sodium birnessite (1 : 1 with inert diluent) cures polysulfide to levels comparable in terms of stress-strain properties, moisture transmission rate, hardness, surface condition, low- and high- temperature properties, and degree of polysulfide cross linking to that achieved with commercial agent. The mechanism of the curing of polysulfide with sodium birnessite, as with all curing agents is conversion of mercaptan groups -S-H into disulfide linkages (-S-S-). Sodium birnessite is a mixed oxidation state compound and its synthesis results in the inclusion of Mn 2 + in addition to Mn 4 + ions in the manganese oxide based lattice. A rationale for the improved curing ability of sodium birnessite is presented. It is based on the ability of Mn 2 + to create vacancies in the Mn 4 + sub-lattice thus increasing the mobility of the Mn 4 in the structure and its transport {{to the surface of the}} curing agent where the oxidation reduction reaction responsible for the cure takes place. Financial support was obtained from Twinstar Chemicals Ltd, and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental {{results on the}} effectiveness of commercial sealants on radon gas diffusion through fractured concrete. Two laboratory proven <b>sealants</b> (<b>polysulfide</b> and epoxy no-filler) as well as the standard polyurethane sealant were tested on fractured concrete samples under controlled conditions. The concrete samples were 4 " in length, 3. 5 " in diameter and of standard 1 : 2 : 4 (cement:sand: pea gravel) composition with a waterzcement ratio of 0. 5. An average fracture width of 0. 05 " throughout the entire concrete sample was prefabricated using metallic shims during the casting process. The laboratory measurements show that the sealants: can reduce the effective diffusion coefficient by as much as 99. 4 % when applied to the fracture and surrounding facial area of the concrete. Details of the experimental setup and procedures are discussed...|$|R
25|$|An {{adhesive}} sealant (polyisobutylene) {{is applied}} to the face of the spacer on each side and the panes pressed against the spacer. If the unit is gas filled, two holes are drilled into the spacer of the assembled unit, lines are attached to draw out the air out of the space and replacing it (or leaving just vacuum) with the desired gas. The lines are then removed and holes sealed to contain the gas. The more modern technique is to use an online gas filler, which eliminates the need to drill holes in the spacer. The units are then sealed on the edge side using either <b>polysulfide</b> or silicone <b>sealant</b> or similar material to prevent humid outside air from entering the unit. The desiccant will remove traces of humidity from the air space so that no water appears on the inside faces (no condensation) of the glass panes facing the air space during cold weather. Some manufacturers have developed specific processes that combine the spacer and desiccant into a single step application system.|$|R
