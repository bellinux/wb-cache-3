5|$|<b>Paper</b> <b>cup</b> {{and paper}} napkin: Paper cups have been {{documented}} in imperial China, alongside paper napkins. Paper cups were known as chih pei and {{were used for the}} serving of tea. They were constructed in different sizes and colors, and were adorned with decorative designs. Paper napkins, or chih pha, accompanied tea cups and were folded into squares. Textual evidence of paper cups and napkins appears in a description of the possessions of the Yu family, from the city of Hangzhou.|$|E
5|$|In September 2015 at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, {{students}} and entrepreneurs presented a fully automatic, prototype vending machine that cooks frozen potato strips by deep frying them. The final product is served with mayonnaise, ketchup or curry. The process takes around two minutes {{from start to}} finish, in which the product is served in a <b>paper</b> <b>cup.</b> The potato strips are stored in a frozen state inside the machine at −18°C, and it cooks them in oil at 180°C. The unit uses a specially-designed dispenser to prevent the potatoes from being crushed or broken. As of September 2015, only the single prototype is available, which is housed at Wageningen University. Orders are placed using a touchscreen, and a fork and salt are provided separately in a box.|$|E
40|$|<b>Paper</b> <b>cups</b> are {{ubiquitous}} {{in daily life}} for serving water, soup, coffee, tea, and milk due to their convenience, biodegradability, recyclability, and sustainability. The thermal insulation performance of <b>paper</b> <b>cups</b> is of significance because {{they are used to}} supply hot food or drinks. Using an effective thermal conductivity to accurately evaluate the thermal insulation performance of <b>paper</b> <b>cups</b> is complex due to the inclusion of complicated components and a multilayer structure. Moreover, an effective thermal conductivity is unsuitable for evaluating thermal insulation performance of <b>paper</b> <b>cups</b> in the case of fluctuating temperature. In this work, we propose a facile approach to precisely analyze the thermal insulation performance of <b>paper</b> <b>cups</b> in a particular range of temperature by using an evaluation model based on the MISO (Multiple-Input Single-Output) technical theory, which includes a characterization parameter (temperature factor) and a measurement apparatus. A series of experiments was conducted according to this evaluation model, and the results show that this evaluation model enables accurate characterization of the thermal insulation performance of <b>paper</b> <b>cups</b> and provides an efficient theoretical basis for selecting paper materials for <b>paper</b> <b>cups...</b>|$|R
50|$|Most <b>paper</b> <b>cups</b> are {{designed}} for a single use and then disposal. Very little recycled paper is used to make <b>paper</b> <b>cups</b> because of contamination concerns and regulations. Since most <b>paper</b> <b>cups</b> are coated with plastic (polyethylene), then both composting and recycling of <b>paper</b> <b>cups</b> is uncommon {{because of the difficulty}} in separating the polyethylene in the recycling process of said cups. As of 2016, there are only two facilities in the UK able to properly recycle PE-coated cups; in the absence of such facilities, the cups are taken to landfill, or, at best, incinerated.|$|R

500|$|Starting {{with the}} {{introduction}} of its BK Chicken Fries product in 2005, BK began adapting some of its product packaging so that it could be placed in an automotive cup holder. The BK Chicken Fry box, while square in shape, will sit comfortably in the cup holder and its top, when opened, forms a small tray that is designed to hold dipping sauce. Burger King credits the design of this box with helping to make its Chicken Fries the most popular adult-oriented chicken product in the United States. It has since added a trademarked and patented round French fry container which it calls the [...] "FryPod", which is a <b>paper</b> <b>cup</b> made from 50 percent recycled materials that is designed to fit in an automotive cup holder. The package design won an honorable mention at a packaging industry design competition. BK's large and King sized beverage containers are made from molded HDPE plastic with a funnel-like shaped bottom that allows the oversized cups to fit in cup holders.|$|E

The BK Chicken Fry box, while square in shape, will sit comfortably in the cup holder and its top, when opened, forms a small tray that is designed to hold dipping sauce. Burger King credits the design of this box with helping to make its Chicken Fries the most popular adult-oriented chicken product in the United States at the time. Since most of the fast food industry's business is take-out or drive-thru traffic, this allowed the convenience food purchaser to drive and eat with little effort. With the introduction of the BK Chicken Fries, BK began adapting some of its other product packaging so that it could also be placed in an automotive cup holder. In addition to the Chicken Fries container, the company added a trademarked and patented, round French fry container which it calls the [...] "FryPod", which is a <b>paper</b> <b>cup</b> made from 50 percent recycled materials that is also designed to fit in an automotive cup holder.

His mother retaliated by not buying clothes that she was not allowed to try on. He remembered hearing a white man deliberately calling his father by the wrong name: [...] "'He knows my name, boy,' my father said after a long pause. 'He calls all colored people George.'"
