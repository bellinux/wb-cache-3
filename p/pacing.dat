5|$|Another critic has {{positively}} {{commented on}} McCloskey's use of page breaks as a <b>pacing</b> technique.

McCloskey also employs this page break method to heighten surprise. When searching for a home, Mr. and Mrs. Mallard seem {{to have found a}} home on page eleven.|$|E
5|$|Christian Donlan of Eurogamer was {{surprised}} by the long length of the game and the amount of variety it offered given its simple premise. He enjoyed the game's <b>pacing</b> and felt that separating puzzles into short levels kept the game fun. Game Informer reviewer Kyle Hilliard also approved of the game's <b>pacing.</b> He remarked that BoxBoy!s low price and well-designed puzzles made it entirely worth playing. VentureBeat writer Gavin Greene agreed that the game offered a lot of content at an inexpensive price. The game's structure did draw some criticism from Jon Wahlgren, writing for Nintendo Life. He thought the game spent too much time teaching new mechanics and did not give players enough freedom to explore or experiment; as a result he believed the game felt restricted.|$|E

40|$|As {{the elder}} {{population}} in the US increases, the need intensifies for community-based alternatives to nursing homes such as the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (<b>PACE).</b> <b>PACE</b> nevertheless faces challenges in recruiting participants into this program. Much remains unknown about <b>PACE</b> as a choice of care, including what is enrollment in <b>PACE.</b> Thus, this qualitative descriptive study explored enrollment in a Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (<b>PACE)</b> {{from the perspective of}} elders, families, and staff. The research questions for this study were: What is enrollment in a <b>PACE?</b> When, how, and why do elders enroll in <b>PACE?</b> What events contribute or lead to enrollment in <b>PACE</b> from the perspectives of elders, families, and staff? This study answers to these questions through the description of <b>PACE</b> enrollment organized under the umbrella of Knowing the Whole Story, which exemplifies <b>PACE</b> enrollment at a collective level. Condition, Process, and Consequence illustrates the overall progression of <b>PACE</b> enrollment. The condition for <b>PACE</b> enrollment is The One, an individual who is accountable for what happens during <b>PACE</b> enrollment. The main process of <b>PACE</b> enrollment is looking for the best. Participants describe looking for the best using the practical terms of level four; learning, navigating, and visualizing. As the member and family transit <b>PACE</b> enrollment they decide to do what is best and enroll in <b>PACE.</b> Deciding is an iterative reflection characterized retrospectively as “I enrolled myself” or family decides. <b>PACE</b> enrollment concludes with membership, which is the consequence of <b>PACE</b> enrollment. This qualitative description of enrollment in a <b>PACE</b> portrays a vivid image of <b>PACE</b> enrollment and illuminates previously undocumented aspects of when, how, and why elders and families enroll in <b>PACE</b> services. These findings alternately contrast and corroborate issues previously outlined in literature investigating <b>PACE</b> and nursing home enrollment. This study highlights the complexity and nuance of enrollment and the need for further research exploring the determinants when, how, and why people use <b>PACE</b> and other community-based long-term care services. ...|$|R

5|$|Several horses {{imported}} to the United States from Canada had {{a lasting}} impact on American horse breeding. In the early 1800s, a roan-coloured stallion named Copperbottom was imported to Lexington, Kentucky from Quebec, through Michigan. He {{began to be}} offered for stud service in 1816, and his progeny spread throughout the eastern US. Known mainly as saddle stock, they also included several <b>pacing</b> horses. Another roan stallion, Tom Hal, a successful pacer in his own right, founded an important family of pacers in the US. Appearing in Kentucky in 1824, he was offered for stud, and his offspring (many of whom carried on the family name, being differentiated only {{by the name of}} the owner) began the family of Standardbreds that included Little Brown Jug, Brown Hal, Star Pointer, Adios and Good Time, all champion harness racing horses. Another <b>pacing</b> import to the US was a black stallion named Old Pilot, said to have been bred near Montreal, who originated the Pilot family of trotting horses. Old Pilot produced a son, also named Pilot, who was acclaimed as a sire of trotting horses, as well as being a successful harness horse himself.|$|E
