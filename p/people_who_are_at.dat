5|$|The annual age-adjusted {{incidence}} rate (AAIR) of PSP {{is thought to}} be three to six times as high in males as in females. Fishman cites AAIR's of 7.4 and 1.2 cases per 100,000 person-years in males and females, respectively. Significantly above-average height is also associated with increased risk of PSP – in <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> least 76 inches (1.93 meters) tall, the AAIR is about 200 cases per 100,000 person-years. Slim build also seems to increase the risk of PSP.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis {{prevention}} and control efforts rely {{primarily on the}} vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases. The World Health Organization has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> high risk for latent tuberculosis with either tuberculin skin tests or interferon-gamma release assays.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia, another {{potential}} complication, develops {{in as many}} as 20% of people with pulmonary contusion. Contused lungs are less able to remove bacteria than uninjured lungs, predisposing them to infection. Intubation and mechanical ventilation further increase the risk of developing pneumonia; the tube is passed through the nose or mouth into the airways, potentially tracking bacteria from the mouth or sinuses into them. Also, intubation prevents coughing, which would clear bacteria-laden secretions from the airways, and secretions pool near the tube's cuff and allow bacteria to grow. The sooner the endotracheal tube is removed, the lower the risk of pneumonia, but if it is removed too early and has to be put back in, the risk of pneumonia rises. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> risk for pulmonary aspiration (e.g. those with lowered level of consciousness due to head injuries) are especially likely to get pneumonia. As with ARDS, the chances of developing pneumonia increase with the size of the contusion. Children and adults have been found to have similar rates of complication with pneumonia and ARDS.|$|E

5|$|SCI is {{extremely}} disruptive to sexuality, and it most frequently happens to young <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> a peak in their sexual and reproductive lives. Yet {{the importance of}} sexuality {{as a part of}} life is not diminished by a disabling injury. Although for years people with SCI were believed to be asexual, research has shown sexuality to be a high priority for people with SCI and an important aspect of quality of life. In fact, of all abilities they would like to have return, most paraplegics rated sexual function as their top priority, and most tetraplegics rated it second, after hand and arm function. Sexual function has a profound impact on self-esteem and adjustment to life post-injury. People who are able to adapt to their changed bodies and to have satisfying sex lives have better overall quality of life.|$|E

500|$|Retaining {{secretions}} in the airways can worsen hypoxia {{and lead}} to infections. [...] Thus, {{an important part of}} treatment is pulmonary toilet, the use of suction, deep breathing, coughing, and other methods to remove material such as mucus and blood from the airways. [...] Chest physical therapy makes use of techniques such as breathing exercises, stimulation of coughing, suctioning, percussion, movement, vibration, and drainage to rid the lungs of secretions, increase oxygenation, and expand collapsed parts of the lungs. People with pulmonary contusion, especially those who do not respond well to other treatments, may be positioned with the uninjured lung lower than the injured one to improve oxygenation. Inadequate pulmonary toilet can result in pneumonia. People who do develop infections are given antibiotics. No studies have yet shown a benefit of using antibiotics as a preventative measure before infection occurs, although some doctors do recommend prophylactic antibiotic use even without scientific evidence of its benefit. However, this can cause the development of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria, so giving antibiotics without a clear need is normally discouraged. For <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> especially high risk of developing infections, the sputum can be cultured to test for the presence of infection-causing bacteria; when they are present, antibiotics are used.|$|E

2500|$|Paul {{founded and}} built up {{the church in}} Ephesus; however, this letter {{does not appear to}} contain the usual {{specific}} greetings, seen in Paul's other letters, addressed to people he remembers.

Some of the oldest manuscripts of this letter are not addressed to [...] "God's holy <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> Ephesus," [...] but merely to [...] "God's holy people." [...] Marcion, around 140, quoted from this letter and attributed the quote to Paul's [...] "Letter to the Laodiceans." [...] In the 17th century, James Ussher suggested that this might have been a [...] "circular letter" [...] that Paul sent to several churches, including Ephesus and Laodicea. This would explain why Paul's usual personal greetings are absent: these could not be included in a letter sent to several different churches.|$|E
2500|$|Thrombosis {{prophylaxis}} {{is often}} prescribed for hospitalized patients routinely {{by a number}} of means. Anticoagulants are often prescribed. Pre-operatively some patients receive low-molecular-weight heparin once a day. Additional risk factors such as obesity, disease, malignancies, long surgeries, and immobility may influence the prescribed dosage. Anticoagulant medications prevent the formation of blood clots in <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> high risk for their development. Treating blood clots that have already formed is managed by the use of anti-hemolytic ("clot busters"). The list below describes some of the more common medications used to prevent blood clots. Note that generally that since blood clotting is inhibited, a side effect typically is bleeding, though it can be reversed by administering a medication that stops the bleeding or by discontinuation of the medication itself. Anti-coagulant administration is often given {{before the start of the}} operation. There are concerns with the potential of increased risk of bleeding and so many surgeons start giving anti-coagulants the first 6 hours after surgery.Medications that inhibit blood clot formation include: ...|$|E
