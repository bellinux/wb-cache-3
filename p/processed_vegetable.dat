2500|$|Most {{fatty acids}} are non-essential, meaning {{the body can}} produce them as needed, {{generally}} from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so.

An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids—omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids—seems also important for health, although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these [...] "omega" [...] long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins, which have roles throughout the human body. They are hormones, in some respects. The omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g., weakly inflammatory PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1), whereas arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins (e.g. pro-inflammatory PGE 2). Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega-6 linoleic acid (LA) in the human body, or can be taken in directly through food. An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins, which is one reason why a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 is believed important for cardiovascular health. In industrialized societies, people typically consume large amounts of <b>processed</b> <b>vegetable</b> oils, which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids.|$|E

50|$|This {{observation}} {{led some}} critics to invert the AHA guidelines. They stress benefits of dietary SFA, citing presence of natural antioxidants in animal fats, while {{encouraging people to}} avoid foods containing <b>processed</b> <b>vegetable</b> oils. They focus on deleterious effect of dietary PUFA, often mentioning two factors: (1) the vulnerability of PUFA to oxidation {{and the formation of}} free radicals, and (2) the high ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 PUFA in the more common vegetable oils—those derived from “corn, cottonseed, and soya”. Their considerations are not limited to CHD, they point to an entire litany of inflammatory disorders which can be linked to diet and the consumption of <b>processed</b> <b>vegetable</b> oils. Some critics also question the safety of cholesterol-lowering drugs, suggesting that CHD is best controlled using a combination of diet and exercise.|$|E

Norwegians consume less vegetables than nutrition experts recommend and the per capita consumption is lower than in most European countries. To investigate the causes of low consumption, a two-step approach is used to estimate the demand segmented by nine different household types. In the first step, a probit model is estimated to investigate the decision whether to purchase traditional vegetables, salad <b>vegetables,</b> and industrially <b>processed</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Conditional on purchase, an almost ideal demand model is used to model how much to purchase. The own-price elasticities and total expenditure elasticities are high for traditional and industrially <b>processed</b> <b>vegetables</b> for most household types. Especially households with children have elastic demand. Lower value added tax or lower import tariffs for traditional and industrially <b>processed</b> <b>vegetables</b> will increase the demand for these vegetables, while reducing the price of salad vegetables {{seem to have a}} limited effect.

(Much of the evidence presented to support this claim of a large increase in incidence of CHD {{in the early part}} of the century is anecdotal. Statistics covering the period from 1950 to 1980 show that mortality from CHD in the US, although much higher than in most other countries, began to decline slowly after 1966 (mortality in the UK, although initially much lower than in the US, rose continuously during this period). These are mortality figures; the downward trend in the US probably reflects improvements in survival rate and not a decrease in incidence.) ...|$|E

The sticks are non-toxic and safe to handle. In the mid-1990s, the president of Tektronix actually ate part of a stick of solid ink, demonstrating that they are safe to handle and presumably, eat.

During the storage period, weight loss, colour, firmness, soluble solids, titratable acidity and overall quality were evaluated. Non treated fresh-cut cauliflower maintained soluble solid content, good firmness and showed low weight loss, but marketability was limited to 14 days, mainly due to the browning occurring in the cut zones. The hot air treatment increased weight loss during storage, but strongly reduced colour changes of minimally processed cauliflower. This lead to prolonged shelf life up to 3 weeks...|$|E

40|$|Co-operatives {{provide a}} vehicle for the {{vertical}} integration of production andprocessing in agriculture. The producers provide capital for and control theprocessing entity so that their interests are aligned. Returns to producers bundle together the commodity price and the return from the capital invested in processing. Many of the agricultural product markets in New Zealand operate within this cooperative structure {{and in the case}} of the dairy industry it has been required by statute. The forestry wine and <b>processed</b> <b>vegetable</b> industries are notable exceptions in that these industries use contracts between producers and processors as an alternative to vertical integration via co-operatives. In this paper we use examples of contracts between producers and processors in the forestry wine and <b>processed</b> <b>vegetable</b> markets to consider the extent to which contracts may provide efficient vehicles for the alignment of interests between producers and processors in agricultural markets. We consider the ways in which these contracts: Minimise transaction costs; Use incentive mechanisms and monitoring to limit opportunism; Allocate risk; Facilitate investment in specific assets; and Allocate property rights. We assess the implications of the annual crop cycles and perishability of grapes and vegetables with the longer crop cycles of forestry. We conclude that contracts appear to be viable alternatives to co-operative structures and that this is true even in the market for perishable agricultural products...|$|E
