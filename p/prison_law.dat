25|$|In September 2011, Hans Reiser filed a civil lawsuit. In his {{complaint}} {{he named}} more than 70 defendants, including trial judges and his attorney, William H. Du Bois. He claimed, among other things, that his attorney conspired {{with the judge}} to file motions against him, which were impossible to appeal, and that his attorney had forced {{him to take the}} stand against his will. After several rounds of amendments and additional complaints, the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice, which means that Reiser can no longer file civil lawsuits regarding his current convictions. The judges voiced several errors before the dismissal. According to the judges: Reiser's complaint was too long (more than 300 pages in its original form). He had too many defendants, and they included judges, who are immune to lawsuits regarding their official conduct. Finally, the judges could not decide whether there was a cause of action (any illegal deed or event, which could be prosecuted) to accept the plea. Reiser argued that he had not had access to the <b>prison</b> <b>law</b> library and that he had been denied the appointment of an attorney to help him formulate his complaint.|$|E
