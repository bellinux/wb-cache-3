However, such a measurement was unavailable for ICU patients and height measured with a soft tape metric ribbon in the supine position (measured height) {{was considered the}} standard for the 60 ICU patients; it was also measured for all healthy volunteers, as a comparison. Evaluation took also into account height provided on the healthy volunteers’ ID cards (provided height; unavailable for most ICU patients) and the visual estimation provided by the nurse {{in charge of the}} ICU patients (evaluated height).|$|E

40|$|A {{system and}} method are {{provided}} for controlling a stepper motor having a rotor and a multi-phase stator. Sinusoidal command signals define a commanded {{position of the}} motor's rotor. An <b>actual</b> <b>position</b> of the rotor is sensed {{as a function of}} an electrical angle between the <b>actual</b> <b>position</b> and the commanded <b>position.</b> The <b>actual</b> <b>position</b> is defined by sinusoidal position signals. An adjustment signal is generated using the sinusoidal command signals and sinusoidal position signals. The adjustment signal is defined {{as a function of the}} cosine of the electrical angle. The adjustment signal is multiplied by each sinusoidal command signal to generate a corresponding set of excitation signals, each of which is applied to a corresponding phase of the multi-phase stator...|$|R

40|$|Control and {{management}} of transportation systems frequently rely on optimization or simulation methods based on a suitable model. Such a model uses optimization or simulation procedures and correct input data. The input data define transportation infrastructure and transportation flows. Data acquisition is a costly process and so an efficient approach is highly desirable. The infrastructure can be recognized from drawn maps using segmentation, thinning and vectorization. The accurate definition of network topology and nodes position is the {{crucial part of the}} process. Transportation flows can be analyzed as vehicle’s behavior based on video sequences of typical traffic situations. Resulting information consists of vehicle <b>position,</b> <b>actual</b> speed and acceleration along the road section. Data for individual vehicles are statistically processed and standard vehicle characteristics can be recommended for vehicle generator in simulation models...|$|E
40|$|Wire-wrapped frame {{assemblies}} used in spark {{chambers and}} the like can be measured using a system which utilizes a laser, an interferometer, and a retroreflector to precisely measure distance. A light source and a photodetector are located adjacent the incremental assembly and mounted on a movable carriage. The interferometer is also mounted on the movable carriage, while the laser and retroreflector are positioned {{at either end of}} the carriage track. The carriage is moved along one edge of the incremental assembly between the retroreflector and the laser, and as the carriage is moved, the light from the light source to the photodetector is interrupted. This produces a trigger command to a control unit which in turn causes a distance measurement to be made. A printout is provided for each sampling trigger command to list such items as ideal <b>position,</b> <b>actual</b> position and amount of error...|$|E

30|$|In the R+iSpace, the {{position}} of the device is determined as the estimated position. Therefore, the error between the estimated <b>position</b> and <b>actual</b> <b>position</b> should be small and within a certain range. As shown by the results, the maximum error is approximately 2.2 mm, which is an acceptable error for the R+iSpace. From Fig.  18, the estimated positional error is not accumulated with the continued movement.|$|R
30|$|Apparently, vehicles’ {{moving speed}} and {{direction}} may change in realistic environments. For example, a node may {{move back to}} prior road in the opposite direction, rendering prediction error of node’s trajectory. Thus, when the data packet reaches the pre-estimated <b>position,</b> the <b>actual</b> <b>position</b> of the destination can be far away. There are three cases when the applied predictive information goes wrong for forwarding data packets.|$|R

40|$|This study dedicates a new {{approach}} for detecting the pedestrians and the objects in the dark environment using a spatial filter. Detecting an <b>actual</b> <b>position</b> of an object and {{a person in the}} dark region is an atomic challenge for many researchers. To detect the objects and the persons, a spatial filter is utilized. The basic idea of the spatial filter is adapted by varying its radii of the dark region. Based on the radii’s variation, the persons and the objects are detected. Finally, the <b>actual</b> <b>position</b> of detecting objects and persons are segmented using object compensation. Extensive experiments have been carried out on an object equipped with an infrared/digital camera and preliminarily tested in different situations. This proposed method is achieved 90. 7 % accuracy in detecting an <b>actual</b> <b>position</b> of the human and the object in the dark area...|$|R
