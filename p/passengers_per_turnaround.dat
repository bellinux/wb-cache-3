5000|$|The {{projected}} ridership of {{the line}} is 5,400 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> hour in the peak direction by 2031, but {{the capacity of the}} vehicles is 15,000 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> hour per direction.|$|R
50|$|The {{system is}} {{designed}} to handle 30,000 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> hour. The Orange Line will initially carry 250,000 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> day, with ridership of 500,000 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> day three years after commencement of service. The {{system is designed}} to operate with a minimum headway of two minutes. It is expected that the station will serve 24,520 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> hour in the Orange Line's first year of operations - a figure {{which is expected to}} rise to 49,550 by 2025.|$|R

50|$|<b>Passengers</b> <b>per</b> hour <b>per</b> {{direction}} or <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> hour in peak direction (pphpd or p/h/d) {{is a measure}} of the capacity of a rapid transit or public transport system.|$|R
25|$|The 1960s station {{also had}} become {{inadequate}} for {{the level of}} traffic it was dealing with; it had been designed with capacity for 650 trains and 60,000 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> day. In 2008 there were 1,350 trains and over 120,000 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> day. By 2013 it was 140,000 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> day. This made overcrowding and closures on safety grounds more common.|$|R
25|$|Grade {{separated}} {{light rail}} systems can move 15,000 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> hour {{on a fixed}} route, but these are usually fully grade separated systems. Street level systems typically move up to 7,500 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> hour. Heavy rail subways can move 50,000 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> hour. As with PRT, these estimates depend on having enough trains. Neither light nor heavy rail scales well for off-peak operation.|$|R
25|$|A {{terminal}} building, {{constructed in}} 1977, provides an operational area of 15,537 sq.m. It can serve 600 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> hour on domestic routes, and 450 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> hour on international routes.|$|R
50|$|It was {{declared}} an officially preserved railway in 1992, carrying about 40,000 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> {{year at the}} time. A decade later, it carried 115,000 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> year, 70% of whom were foreign tourists.|$|R
50|$|Based on this data, {{the minimum}} headway and maximum current vehicle capacities, the {{theoretical}} maximum throughput measured in <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> hour per direction (PPHPD) {{for a single}} traffic lane is some 90,000 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> hour (250 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> vehicle, one vehicles every 10 seconds). In real world conditions TransMilenio holds the record, with 35,000 - 40,000 PPHPD with most other busy systems operating in the 15,000 to 25,000 range.|$|R
50|$|The Mexicable Ecatepec {{consists}} of 190 cars, {{and each one}} of them can carry 10 passengers. The predicted capacity is 6,000 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> hour and 29,000 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> day, with a fare of six pesos.|$|R
50|$|A {{system may}} carry {{a high number}} of <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> {{distance}} (km or mile) but a relatively low number of <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> bus hour if vehicles operate in congested areas and thus travel at slower speed.|$|R

It was expected that by 1990, passenger movement at Confins would be nearly 2 million <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> year. However, it surpassed the 1 million passenger mark only 22 years later.

50|$|Tourism {{began in}} 1936 when Otto Reinhart {{organized}} {{the installation of}} the first gondola that connected Stöckalp with Melchsee-Frutt. There were two cabins with a capacity of 4 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> cabin. By 1945, the gondola was upgraded to two cabins with a capacity of 8 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> cabin. Over the next decade, tourism increase and in 1956, Habegger AG was commissioned to build a new Gondola with two 33 passenger cabins and a maximum capacity of 156 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> hour.|$|R

50|$|Terminal 1, {{commissioned}} in April 2014, has twelve aerobridge equipped parking bays. The terminal {{is designed}} for 6 million <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> year.

5000|$|The metro {{line can}} move 41,000 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> hour, the {{equivalent}} of 150 million <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> year, with a headway of under 2 minutes. Trains can travel at speeds of up to 70 km/h, and the line is open from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m.|$|R
50|$|Moreover, typical {{passenger}} rail carries 2.83 {{times as many}} <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> hour per metre width as a road. A typical capacity is the Eurostar, which provides capacity for 12 trains per hour and 800 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> train, totaling 9,600 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> hour in each direction. By contrast, the Highway Capacity Manual gives a maximum capacity of 2,250 <b>passenger</b> cars <b>per</b> hour per lane, excluding other vehicles, assuming an average vehicle occupancy of 1.57 people. A standard twin track railway has a typical capacity 13% greater than a 6-lane highway (3 lanes each way), while requiring only 40% of the land (1.0/3.0 versus 2.5/7.5 hectares per kilometre of direct/indirect land consumption). The Tokaido Shinkansen line in Japan, has a much higher ratio (with as many as 20,000 <b>passengers</b> <b>per</b> hour per direction). Similarly commuter roads tend to carry fewer than 1.57 persons per vehicle (Washington State Department of Transportation, for instance, uses 1.2 persons per vehicle) during commute times.|$|R
