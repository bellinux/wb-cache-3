An instantaneous velocity error is calculated and the powder flow is controlled as a function of this variation using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals.

40|$|The laser {{cladding}} process is mainly {{determined by the}} applied <b>powder</b> <b>flux,</b> the laser beam intensity, and the feed rate {{as well as by}} the strongly interacting influences of heat flow, free surface shape, and surface tension gradient driven (Marangoni) flow in the melt pool. Convection due to superheating may be responsible for undesired dilution of the bead with the substrate material. A quasi-stationary state temperature field is calculated by means of Rosenthal's solution, assuming some low energy surface shape for the liquid head of a single track bead. This shape is analytically described with free parameters which have to be determined from the <b>powder</b> <b>flux</b> and the feed rate and by fitting iteratively the temperature condition at the border line between the melted part of the bead and the substrate. The Marangoni flow essentially modifies the primary surface heat source density caused by the laser beam and the impinging preheated powder particles and, therefore, has a large influence on heat transfer and temperature gradients in the melt pool, particularly on its surface. Hence the temperature field, the fluid flow velocity at the melt pool surface and the unknown parameters of the bead geometry have to be calculated iteratively in a selfconsistent manner. The simulation is to visualize the origin of various possible failures during the cladding process and of the resulting lacks in the quality of treatment such as insufficient heating of the melt pool, poor bonding between substrate and bead, or too large a dilution of the bead with the substrate material. It is the aim of the present approach to get a tool for applications in manufacturing which is able to calculate the temperature field in {{laser cladding}} within a time much shorter than that usually required in computing thermocapillary flow by means of the Finite Element Method...|$|R

An equipment independent parameter, dimensionless spray flux Psi (a), is defined to characterise the most important process parameters in the nucleation process: solution flowrate, <b>powder</b> <b>flux,</b> and binder drop size. Ex-granulator experiments are used to study the relationship between dimensionless spray flux, process variables and the coverage of binder fluid on the powder surface. Lactose monohydrate powder on a variable speed riffler passed under a flat spray once only. Water and 7 % HPC solution at two spray pressures were used as binders. Experiments with red dye and image analysis demonstrate that changes in dimensionless spray flux correlate with a measurable difference in powder surface coverage. Nucleation experiments show that spray flux controls {{the size and shape of}} the nuclei size distribution. At low Psi (a), the system operates in the drop controlled regime, where one drop forms one nucleus and the nuclei size distribution is narrow. At higher Psi (a), the powder surface cakes creating a broader size distribution. For controlled nucleation with the narrowest possible size distribution, it is recommended that the dimensionless spray flux be less than 0. 1 to be in the drop-controlled regime.

50|$|Unless brazing {{operations}} are contained within an inert or reducing atmosphere environment (i.e. a vacuum furnace), a flux such as borax {{is required to}} prevent oxides from forming while the metal is heated. The flux also serves the purpose of cleaning any contamination left on the brazing surfaces. Flux can be applied {{in any number of}} forms including <b>flux</b> paste, liquid, <b>powder</b> or pre-made brazing pastes that combine flux with filler metal <b>powder.</b> <b>Flux</b> can also be applied using brazing rods with a coating of flux, or a flux core. In either case, the flux flows into the joint when applied to the heated joint and is displaced by the molten filler metal entering the joint. Excess flux should be removed when the cycle is completed because flux left in the joint can lead to corrosion, impede joint inspection, and prevent further surface finishing operations. Phosphorus-containing brazing alloys can be self-fluxing when joining copper to copper.Fluxes are generally selected based on their performance on particular base metals. To be effective, the flux must be chemically compatible with both the base metal and the filler metal being used. Self-fluxing phosphorus filler alloys produce brittle phosphides if used on iron or nickel. As a general rule, longer brazing cycles should use less active fluxes than short brazing operations.|$|R

The need to improve and optimize the finished product made it essential to gain more knowledge about the process, types of defects that may occur and the reasons for them. Moreover, the solutions for reducing the shortcomings in continuous casting process have been an intriguing subject to study. Many attempts have been done in order to reach this goal. Understanding, determining and optimizing the mould flux slag properties is especially important, since it plays an important and significant role in this process.

40|$|Dimensionless spray flux Ψa is a {{dimensionless}} group that characterises {{the three most}} important variables in liquid dispersion: flowrate, drop size and <b>powder</b> <b>flux</b> through the spray zone. In this paper, the Poisson distribution was used to generate analytical solutions for the proportion of nuclei formed from single drops (fsingle) and the fraction of the powder surface covered by drops (fcovered) as a function of Ψa. Monte-Carlo simulations were performed to simulate the spray zone and investigate how Ψa, fsingle and fcovered are related. The Monte-Carlo data was an excellent match with analytical solutions of fcovered and fsingle as a function of Ψa. At low Ψa, the proportion of the surface covered by drops (fcovered) was equal to Ψa. As Ψa increases, drop overlap becomes more dominant and the powder surface coverage levels off. The proportion of nuclei formed from single drops (fsingle) falls exponentially with increasing Ψa. In the ranges covered, these results were independent of drop size, number of drops, drop size distribution (mono-sized, bimodal and trimodal distributions), and the uniformity of the spray. Experimental data of nuclei size distributions as a function of spray flux were fitted to the analytical solution for fsingle by defining a cutsize for single drop nuclei. The fitted cutsizes followed the spray drop sizes suggesting that the method is robust and that the cutsize does indicate the transition size between single drop and agglomerate nuclei. This demonstrates that the nuclei distribution is determined by the dimensionless spray flux and the fraction of drop controlled nuclei can be calculated analytically in advance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The recent {{trend in}} low {{temperature}} co-fired ceramic (LTCC) technology is to integrate more elements into multilayer modules. This thesis describes work specifically aimed at developing ferroelectric barium strontium titanate (BST) for integration into such modules. In particular, an objective was {{the development of}} a novel, electric field controlled, tunable component to be used at microwave frequencies (2 – 26 GHz). For the application envisaged, relative permittivity is required to be low (100 – 1000) and adjustable by a suitable applied electric field, the dissipation factor at room temperature must be low (~ 0. 001) at 2 – 26 GHz, and most importantly, the sintering temperature must be suited to the LTCC technology (~ 900  °C) Initial work was focused on sol-gel derived Ba 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 TiO 3 powders with boron oxide addition, which were sintered at 900  °C, the dissipation factor was 0. 006. The dissipation factor was not low enough for the desired microwave application, and attention turned to powders prepared by the mixed-oxide route. The Ba 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 TiO 3 <b>powders,</b> <b>fluxed</b> with the optimum amounts of boron oxide and lithium carbonate, could be sintered at 890  °C to the same density as is achieved with un-fluxed Ba 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 TiO 3 sintered at 1360  °C. The dissipation factor for this <b>fluxed</b> <b>powder</b> was acceptably low, although permittivity was too high for the particular objective. Subsequently, research was on BST modified by magnesia, 0. 4 Ba 0. 55 Sr 0. 45 TiO 3 - 0. 6 MgO (BSTM). With the optimum fluxing additives, the sintering temperature necessary to achieve a dense BSTM-based ceramic was reduced to 950  °C. The developed microstructure was good, and the relative permittivity and dissipation factor values (221, 0. 0012 at 1 kHz) at room temperature indicated good microwave properties. Studies were also undertaken with organic-based tape-casting slurries, laminating procedures and burn-out and sintering schedules. Several kinds of tapes were fabricated and characterized. A test structure for the measurement of dielectric properties at 26 GHz of the optimized BSTM-based ceramic was constructed. The specimen was 50 μm thick layer of BST on an alumina substrate. The relative permittivity and tunability were 130 and > 15 % at 4 V μm- 1 at room temperature.

Two physically realistic nasal airway models {{were used to assess}} the effects of patient-use experimental conditions, nasal airway geometry and formulation / device properties on the delivery efficiency of nasal spray products. There was a large variability in drug delivery to the middle passages ranging from 17 – 57 % and 47 – 77 % with respect to patient use conditions for the two nasal airway geometries. The patient use variables of nasal spray position, head angle and nasal inhalation timing with respect to spray actuation were found to be significant in determining nasal valve penetration and middle passage deposition of Nasonex®. The developed test methods were able to reproducibly generate similar nasal deposition profiles for nasal spray products with similar plume and droplet characteristics. Differences in spray plume geometry (smaller plume diameter resulted in higher middle passage drug delivery) were observed to have more influence on regional nasal drug deposition than changes to droplet size for mometasone furoate formulations in the realistic airway models. Ciprofloxacin nanoparticles with a mean (SD) volume diameter of 120 (10) nm suitable for penetration through mucus and biofilm layers were prepared using sonocrystallization technique.

In order to prevent sticking of the steel onto the mould it oscillates vertically leaving oscillation marks {{on the surface of the}} solidified steel shell. In the present study the interaction of the steel melt, the solidified steel shell and the slag will be inves-tigated. On the basis of thin layer approximations for the slag flow and heat transfer through the steel shell, slag and mould, respectively, and dominating surface tension at the interface liquid steel/liquid slag a mathematical model will be derived, solved numerically and compared with data reported in the literature. The flow problem for the slag flow is closely related to the well known coating problem...|$|R
