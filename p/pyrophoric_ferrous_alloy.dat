The combination of physical properties such as strength, ductility, conductivity, corrosion resistance and machinability makes these suitable {{for a wide range}} of applications. These properties can be further enhanced with variations in composition and manufacturing processes.

Chromium and nitrogen content in the alloy are determinant for its microstructure and its mechanical properties. In this work <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloys</b> with different chromium contents are treated in nitrogen glow discharge.

Next, the effect of alloying additions on the hardenability of <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloys</b> was discussed. A formula was given to determine the temperature of the beginning of bainitic transformation with examples of the diagrams illustrating the effect of some selected alloying additions on the hardenability factor.

50|$|Quenching is {{a process}} of cooling a metal at a rapid rate. This is most often done to produce a {{martensite}} transformation. In <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloys,</b> this will often produce a harder metal, while non-ferrous alloys will usually become softer than normal.|$|R
40|$|The {{corrosion}} resistance of electroless nickel (EN) coatings on ferrous substrates {{is affected by}} coating porosity. Carbon and iron carbide {{are present in the}} microstructure of <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloys.</b> If the sites of carbon and iron carbide are not catalytically active to EN deposition as the rest of substrate surface, there is a possibility of pore formation on these sites. In the present study, the rate of EN deposition on carbon, iron carbide and steel surfaces was individually measured. The locations of EN deposit on the microstructure of a <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloy</b> was mapped with the SEM/EDS technique and was compared to the locations of carbon on the original substrate surface. This paper summarizes the results of these investigations...|$|R
5000|$|There are {{hundreds}} of alloys that contain carbon. The most common of these alloys is steel, sometimes called [...] "carbon steel" [...] (see [...] ). All kinds of steel contain some amount of carbon, by definition, and all <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloys</b> contain some carbon.|$|R
50|$|Moving {{iron and}} induced magnet types (ADC being a {{well-known}} example) have a moving piece of iron or other <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloy</b> is coupled to the cantilever (instead of a magnet), while a permanent, bigger magnet {{is over the}} coils, providing the necessary magnetic flux.|$|R
40|$|The {{technological}} {{importance of}} <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloys</b> rests {{to a large}} extent on their relatively low cost and on their ability to achieve desirable strength-ductility combinations. The attainment of superior properties depends to a large degree on the phase transformations to and from austenite that occur during processing. From a scientific standpoint, <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloys</b> have been and continue to be benchmark materials from which solid–solid phase transformations understanding, broadly considered, was first formulated and developed. Since pioneering studies began in the 1880 s, significant advances in this understanding have been made in view of developments such as the first Fe-C phase diagram (1900), X-ray diffraction (1920 s), T-T-T diagrams (1930 s), classical nucleation-and-growth theory (1940 s), theories of martensite (1950 s), and electron microscopy (1950 s).

50|$|In many {{magnetic}} <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloys,</b> the Curie point, {{the temperature}} at which magnetic materials cease to behave magnetically, occurs at {{nearly the same}} temperature as the austenite transformation. This behavior is attributed to the paramagnetic nature of austenite, while both martensite and ferrite are strongly ferromagnetic.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{deep sea}} {{corrosion}} of <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloys</b> that undergo uniform corrosion without forming a passive layer {{is related to}} the amount of dissolved oxygen available in the sea water. The preformance of some <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloys</b> at depths of 500, 1200, 3500, and 5100 m in the Indian Ocean has been studied. The results of atomic absorption spectroscopy have revealed that the corrosion product present on mild steel coupons is FeOOH. The results of experiments in shallow water have shown that micro- and macrobiological growths {{play a significant role in}} the corrosion of ferrous materials. However, in deeper waters, the absence of macrofouling was evident, and corrosion was not related to any biological product but mainly to the electrochemical reaction of these alloys with sea water. The results of morphological studies by SEM on the surfaces of exposed specimens are also presented...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} describing the essence of the process of introducing nitrogen to the melt of <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloys</b> by application of overpressure above the metal bath. The problem was discussed in terms of both theory (the thermodynamic aspects of the process) and practice (the technical and technological aspects, safety of the furnace stand operation, and technique of conducting the melt). The novel technique of melting under high pressure of the gas atmosphere (up to 5 MPa) has not been used so far in the domestic industry, mainly {{because of the lack of}} proper equipment satisfyng the requirements of safe operation. Owing to cooperation undertaken with a partner from Bulgaria, a more detailed investigation of this technology has become possible and melting of selected <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloys</b> was conducted under the gas atmosphere at a pressure of about 3, 5 MPa...|$|R

40|$|The {{action of}} various alloys: 440 C steel, M- 50 steel, Pyrowear 675, Cronidur 30 and Ti(4 Al, 4 Mn); {{the effect of}} decradation inhibitors: mono- and diphospha-s-triazines, di{{phosphate}}traazacyclooctatetraene, phosphate esters, phosphate/ diester rust inhibiting mixtures, and a phosphine were evaluated in two poly(hexafluoropropene oxide) fluids (143 AC and 16256). The degradation promoting action of the <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloys</b> in 16256 fluid were comparable; Ti(4 Al, 4 Mn) alloy was significantly more detrimental. The overall rating of the additives was: phosphates (greater than) phosphate/diester mixture (greater than) phosphine (greater than or equal to) phospha-s-triazines. The 16256 fluid was less responsive to additive inhibition than 143 AC. Phosphate esters were fully effective over 24 hour exposure in the 16256 / 440 C steel and the 16256 /Ti(4 Al, 4 Mn) systems at 330 C. In general, the phosphine was less effective {{in the presence of}} <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloys</b> than the phosphates and phospha-s-triazines...|$|R
50|$|Ferrosilicon {{is used as}} {{a source}} of silicon to reduce metals from their oxides and to deoxidize steel and other <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloys.</b> This {{prevents}} the loss of carbon from the molten steel (so called blocking the heat); ferromanganese, spiegeleisen, silicides of calcium, and many other materials are used for the same purpose. It {{can be used to make}} other ferroalloys. Ferrosilicon is also used for manufacture of silicon, corrosion-resistant and high-temperature resistant <b>ferrous</b> silicon <b>alloys,</b> and silicon steel for electromotors and transformer cores. In the manufacture of cast iron, ferrosilicon is used for inoculation of the iron to accelerate graphitization. In arc welding, ferrosilicon can be found in some electrode coatings.|$|R

50|$|Normalizing is a {{technique}} used to provide uniformity in grain size and composition (equiaxing) throughout an alloy. The term is often used for <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloys</b> that have been austenitized and then cooled in open air. Normalizing not only produces pearlite, but also martensite and sometimes bainite, which gives harder and stronger steel, but with less ductility for the same composition than full annealing.|$|R
25|$|Ferrouranium {{is used as}} {{a deoxidizer}} (more {{powerful}} than ferrovanadium), for denitrogenizing steel, for forming carbides, and as an <b>alloying</b> element. In <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloys,</b> uranium increases the elastic limit and the tensile strength. In high speed steels, it has been used to increase toughness and strength in amounts between 0.05–5%. Uranium-alloyed steels can be used at very low temperatures; nickel-uranium alloys are resistant to even very aggressive chemicals, including aqua regia.|$|R
50|$|The effect works both ways; {{there can}} be {{detrimental}} interactions between the braze alloy and the base metal. Presence of phosphorus in the braze alloy leads to formation of brittle phosphides of iron and nickel, phosphorus-containing alloys are therefore unsuitable for brazing nickel and <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloys.</b> Boron tends to diffuse into the base metals, especially along the grain boundaries, and may form brittle borides. Carbon can negatively influence some steels.|$|R
5000|$|Generally more {{expensive}} than ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals are used because of desirable properties such as low weight (e.g. aluminium), higher conductivity (e.g. copper), [...] non-magnetic property or resistance to corrosion (e.g. zinc). Some non-ferrous materials are also used in the iron and steel industries. For example, bauxite is used as flux for blast furnaces, while others such as wolframite, pyrolusite and chromite are used in making <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloys.</b>|$|R
