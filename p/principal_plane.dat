40|$|Whereas {{much work}} has been done to {{describe}} N-dimensional orientations in terms of principal rotations, these developments have not been extended to the descriptions of N-dimensional kinematics. For threedimensional rotations the angular velocity can be related to derivatives of the principal angle and axis. Following a similar procedure this paper develops the kinematics for N-dimensional rotations in terms of the derivatives of the <b>principal</b> <b>planes</b> and angles. It is shown that the components of the angular velocity lying in the <b>principal</b> <b>planes</b> are related to the derivative of the principal angles and the out-of-plane components are related to the derivative of the vectors spanning the <b>principal</b> <b>planes.</b> Additionally, the kinematic optimal control problem for N-dimensional reorientation is solved while minimizing a quadratic function of the angular velocity.

50|$|Let us {{consider}} that the vibration of polarisation is along OP. On passing through the glass half the vibrations remain along OP. But on passing through quartz half these vibrations will split into 0- and £-components. The £-components are parallel to the optic axis while O- component is perpendicular to optic axis. The O-component travels faster in quartz and hence an emergence 0-component will be along OD instead of along OC. Thus components OA and OO will combine to form a resultant vibration along OQ which makes same angle with optic axis as OP. Now if the <b>Principal</b> <b>plane</b> of the analyzing Nicol is parallel to OP then the light will pass through glass half unobstructed. Hence glass half will be brighter than quartz half or {{we can say that}} glass half will be bright and the quartz half will be dark. Similarly if <b>principal</b> <b>plane</b> of analyzing Nicol is parallel to OQ then quartz half will be bright and glass half will be dark. When the <b>principal</b> <b>plane</b> of analyzer is along AOB then both halves will be equally bright. On the other hand, if the <b>principal</b> <b>plane</b> of analyzer is along DOC. then both the halves will be equally dark. Thus it is clear that if the analyzing Nicol is slightly disturbed from DOC then one half becomes brighter than the other. Hence by using half shade device, one can measure angle of rotation more accurately. Determination of Specific Rotation In order to determine specific rotation of an optically active substance (say sugar) the polarimeter tube T is first filled with pure water and analyzer is adjusted for equal darkness (Both the halves should be equally dark) point. The position of the analyzer is noted with the help of scale. Now the polarimeter tube is filled with sugar solution of known concentration and again the analyser is adjusted {{in such a way that}} again equally dark point is achieved. The position of the analyzer is again noted. The difference of the two readings will give you angle of rotation θ. Hence specific rotation S is determined by using the relation. St λ =θ /LC The above procedure may be repeated for different concentration.|$|E

5000|$|The pallidonigral set {{comprises}} the direct {{targets of the}} striatal axons: the two nuclei of the pallidum and the pars compact and pars reticulata of the [...] "substantia" [...] nigra". One character of this ensemble is given by the very dense striato-pallidonigral bundle giving it its whitish aspect (pallidus means pale). In no ways has the pallidum {{the shape of a}} globe. After Foix and Nicolesco (1925) and some others, Cécile and Oskar Vogt (1941) suggested the term pallidum - also used by the Terminologia Anatomica (1998). They also proposed the term nigrum for replacing nigra, which is indeed not a substance; but this is generally not followed. The whole pallidonigral set is made up the same neuronal components. The majority is made up of very large neurons, poorly branched, strongly stained for parvalbumin, having very large dendritic arborisations (much larger in primates than in rodents) with straight and thick dendrites. Only the shape and direction of the dendritic arborizations differ between the pallidum and the nigra neurons. The pallidal dendritic arborisations are very large flat and discoidal. Their <b>principal</b> <b>plane</b> is parallel to the others and also parallel to the lateral border of the pallidum; thus perpendicular to the axis of the afferences. Since the pallidal discoidal discs are thin, they are crossed only for a short distance by striatal axons. On another hand, since they are wide, they are crossed by many striatalaxons from wide striatal parts. Since they are loose, the chances of contact are not very high. Striatal arborisations, in anotherhand, emit perpendicular branches participating in flat bands parallel to the lateral border, which increases the density of synapses in this direction. This is true for the striatal afferent but also for the subthalamic (see below).The synaptology of the set is uncommon and characteristic. The dendrites of the pallidal or nigral axons are entirely covered by synapses, without any apposition of glia. More than 90% of synapses are of striatal origin. One noticeable property of this ensemble is that not one of its elements receives cortical afferents.Initial collaterals are present. However, in addition to the presence of various appendages at the distal extremity of the pallidal neurons that could act as elements of local circuitry, there are weak or no functional interrelations between pallidal neurons.|$|E
