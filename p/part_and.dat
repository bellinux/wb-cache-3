5|$|A {{compound}} that has two immiscible hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts {{within the same}} molecule is called an amphiphilic molecule. Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic <b>part</b> <b>and</b> hydrophobic part. These structures are formed through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale. Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.|$|E
5|$|Any nonrational {{power of}} a complex number has an {{infinite}} number of possible values because of the multi-valued nature of the complex logarithm.

The central objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a more complete description of the PRC 2 ̆ 019 s <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> components trade. To do so, we systematically separate total trade flows into <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> components and final goods, and give a description of the pattern of <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> components trade for the period 19922 ̆ 0132009.

30|$|The {{second half}} of Table  3 {{displays}} the intra-bloc <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> components export coefficients. In this case, import tariff and PTA depth coefficients are statistically insignificant, signaling an increase in regional integration through the decrease of the import tariffs or non-tariff barriers would not affect the production fragmentation and relocation inside Latin America. Imports of <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> components from LA, North America, and the ROW have positive and statistically significant coefficients. As observed in Florensa et al. (2015), imports of <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> components from these regions generate {{what they called a}} “complementary effect”. In other words, they stimulate production fragmentation and its relocation inside Latin America, since <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> components imported by a Latin American country in the first period produce other <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> components that will be used in a third Latin American country, promoting these countries engagement in machinery productions networks. A 1 % increase in <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> components imports from LA results in an increase of 0.64 % of the intra-bloc export of <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> components. Imports from North America promote an increase of 0.31 %, while imports from the ROW have a smaller effect of 0.19 %.|$|R

30|$|To {{quantify}} {{the impact that}} changes in the structural composition of <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> components suppliers had {{on the development of}} the intra-bloc machinery trade, we follow the methodology proposed by Florensa et al. (2015), an augmented gravity model that accounts for the effect of the import of intermediate products. The adoption of such a framework is justified by the fact that, different from the standard gravity framework, this version accounts for the effect that the import of <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> components of a given sector from a given supplier have on the Latin American intra-bloc exports. The proposed model assumes that in the first period, Latin American countries can import <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> components from any region of the world. These <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> components are employed to produce other <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> components that in a second period will be used domestically or traded with another country. Alternatively, they can be used to manufacture a final product that will be consumed domestically or traded with a third country. We assume that Latin American production networks are created when Latin American countries use <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> components imported from any region of the world to produce a final product or other <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> components that are exported to another Latin American country.|$|R

40|$|The {{investigation}} of some active constituents of Euphorbia bivonae included terpenes, alkaloids, coumarins and anthraquinones to evaluate its economic values as medicinal plant, where sugiol and betulin compounds were {{isolated from the}} aerial <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> roots of Euphorbia bivonae, while ferruginol compound was isolated only from the roots. The total terpenes content of the aerial <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> roots of E. bivonae were 3. 44 and 8. 96 mg/g, respectively, which were estimated spectrophotometrically. Meanwhile, the compounds 2 Piperidinone, N[4 bromonbutyl] and komaroine were isolated from the aerial <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> roots of E. bivonae. While the alkaloid compounds 5, 8 -dihydroxy methyl-canthin- 6 -one and 1 -methoxy- 8 -hydroxy-methyl-canthin- 6 -one were isolated from only the roots. The estimated percentages of the total alkaloids were 0. 40 % and 1. 02 % for the aerial <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> roots, respectively. The coumarin compound umbelliferone was isolated from the aerial <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> roots, and the total coumarins content of the aerial <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> roots were 0. 42 and 0. 49 mg/g, respectively. On other hand anthraquinone compound emodin (1, 3, 8 -trihydroxy- 6 -methyl- 9, 10 anthracenedione) was detected and isolated from the roots only, meanwhile the concentrations of total anthraquinones were 0. 04 and 0. 94 g/ 100 g dry material for aerial <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> roots, respectively.
