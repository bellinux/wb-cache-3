40|$|In road {{roughness}} literature different stochastic {{models of}} <b>parallel</b> road <b>tracks</b> are suggested. A new method is proposed {{to evaluate their}} accuracy, by comparison of measured <b>parallel</b> <b>tracks</b> and synthetic <b>parallel</b> <b>tracks,</b> realized from a stochastic model. A model is judged accurate if synthetic and measured roads induce a similar amount of fatigue damage to a vehicle. A lack-of-fit measure is assigned to the evaluated models, facilitating a quick and simple comparison. The uncertainty of the vehicle fatigue indicated for the measured profile is considered {{in the definition of}} the lack-of-fit measure. A bootstrap technique is applied to estimate the uncertainty.

40|$|The {{neutron stars}} in low-mass X-ray {{binaries}} (LMXBs) are usually {{thought to be}} weakly magnetized objects accreting matter from their low-mass companions {{in the form of}} a disk. Albeit weak as compared to those in young neutron-star systems, the neutron-star magnetospheres in LMXBs can play an important role in determining the correlations between spectral and temporal properties. <b>Parallel</b> <b>tracks</b> appearing in the plane of kilohertz (kHz) quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) frequency versus X-ray flux can be used as a tool to study the magnetosphere-disk interaction in neutron-star LMXBs. For dynamically important weak fields, the formation of a non-Keplerian magnetic boundary layer at the innermost disk truncated near the surface of the neutron star is highly likely. Such a boundary region may harbor oscillatory modes of frequencies in the kHz range. We generate <b>parallel</b> <b>tracks</b> using the boundary region model of kHz QPOs. We also present the direct application of our model to the reproduction of the observed <b>parallel</b> <b>tracks</b> of individual sources such as 4 U 1608 [...] 52, 4 U 1636 [...] 53, and Aql X- 1. We reveal how the radial width of the boundary layer must vary in the long-term flux evolution of each source to regenerate the <b>parallel</b> <b>tracks.</b> The run of the radial width looks similar for different sources and can be fitted by a generic model function describing the average steady behavior of the boundary region in the long term. The <b>parallel</b> <b>tracks</b> then correspond to the possible quasi-steady states the source can occupy around the average trend.
