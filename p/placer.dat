5|$|In {{addition}} to the house, which has a full basement, the museum uses a separate building as a gallery. That building, the Northwest Gallery, was formerly used for storage and as a shop, but looks similar to the Rice House. This gallery focuses on items from Oregon, Idaho, and Washington, and includes collections of agates, thundereggs, zeolites, and <b>placer</b> gold, among others.|$|E
5|$|In {{creating}} the half dollar, Mora used motifs evoking California {{at the time}} of statehood in 1850. The obverse depicts a Gold Rush-era prospector, kneeling. He washes material with his pan, seeking bits of <b>placer</b> gold. The reverse adapts the Flag of California, known as the Bear Flag, showing a grizzly bear. Mora left the fields, or background, of the coin unpolished, giving the piece a textured look.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. - Geologic, mineralogic and {{chemical}} studies indicate {{a considerable amount}} of detrital gold in Kağızman-Kazıkkaya <b>placers.</b> Gold values become of economic interest, especially along a 2 meter thick lowermost part of the <b>placers.</b> Amount of gold increases parallel to the heavy mineral content of the <b>placers,</b> reaching a maximum in 0. 63 mm. - 0. 315 mm. size fraction where heavy mineral content (3 %) shows a four-fold increment comparing to its average value in whole <b>placers.</b> Heavy mineral types identified in the <b>placers</b> are in well agree-ment with those of rocks exposed in the immediate vicinity. Chemical and physical nature of detrital gold is very similar to that of gold in quartz veins. Hence, the source of gold in the <b>placers</b> is mostly linked to quartz veins and less to the listwaenite and shear zones...|$|R
40|$|Reappraisal of {{overlapped}} {{areas of}} Ti-Zr provinces of Australia and Russia for cost-effective Ti-Zr <b>placers</b> {{was made by}} joint research of IMGRE and Macquery University {{on the basis of}} boundary parameters and criteria of prediction, search for, and appraisal of Ti-Zr. The sites selected for comparative research were recent and ancient <b>placers</b> of West Australia Province, Eucla Basin Province, and paleo Murray Basin, as well as Russian Cretaceous and Neogene Ti-Zr <b>placers</b> of East European Province, Neogene <b>placers</b> of Northern Caucasus (Scythian) Province, Cretaceous and Paleogene <b>placers</b> of Western Siberia and Eastern Ural Provinces. Studies of the system "bedrock - weathering crust - intermediate collector - commercial placer" comprised: structural-geomorphologic and paleofacies reconstructions of the territory of provinces; analysis of material composition and distribution of useful components; combined studies into type morphology and isotopic and geochemical characteristics of zircon, ilmenite, rutile and other minerals in all the components of the system, revealing alteration trends during transit from bedrock source to sedimentary basin. As a result of conducted structural geomorphological and paleo facial reconstructions of provinces, a distinct relation was established between the ranked forms of modern relief and corresponding ranks of major elements of substratum geology affecting the formation and persistence of Ti-Zr <b>placers.</b> Forecast maps were constructed for economic Ti-Zr <b>placers.</b> The elaborated and tested complex of research is least time-consuming and least expensive for appraising the prospects for buried industrial <b>placers</b> of overlapped areas at an early stage of studying them. 1 page(s...|$|R
50|$|Comparing to chip shooters, {{flexible}} <b>placers</b> {{are slow}} (6,000 to 40,000 per hour) {{with a high}} accuracy (as low as 25 µm). As a result, flexible <b>placers</b> {{are being used to}} place complex and high I/O active components like QFPs as higher performance I/O components generally require higher accuracy. There are three major types of flexible placer: overhead gentry, revolver head and split-axis. Chip shooters and flexible <b>placers</b> are typically combined to use and they can take account of nearly 65% of the total assembly line cost.|$|R
5|$|In {{the most}} complex <b>placer</b> mining, groups of prospectors would divert the water from an entire river into a sluice {{alongside}} the river, and then dig for gold in the newly exposed river bottom. Modern estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey are that some 12 million ounces (370t) of gold were removed {{in the first five}} years of the Gold Rush (worth over US$16billion at December 2010 prices).|$|E
5|$|Now an outlaw, McTeague {{returns to}} <b>Placer</b> County and teams {{up with a}} {{prospector}} named Cribbens. Headed towards Death Valley, they find a large quantity of quartz and plan to become millionaires. Before they can begin mining, McTeague senses danger and flees into Death Valley with a single horse, the remaining money and one water jug. Several marshals pursue him, joined by Schouler. Schouler wants to catch McTeague personally and rides into Death Valley alone.|$|E

5|$|All three stable {{elements}} {{occur in}} heavy mineral sands ore deposits, which are <b>placer</b> deposits formed, most usually in beach environments, by concentration {{due to the}} specific gravity of the mineral grains of erosion material from mafic and ultramafic rock. The titanium minerals are mostly anatase and rutile, and zirconium occurs in the mineral zircon. Because of the chemical similarity, up to 5% of the zirconium in zircon is replaced by hafnium. The largest producers of the group 4 elements are Australia, South Africa and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Claims that Stroheim's {{original}} cut was {{a completely}} unabridged version of McTeague are not accurate. Stroheim's 300-page script was {{almost as long as}} the original novel, but he rethought the entire story and invented new scenes, as well as extensively elaborating existing ones. In the Norris novel, McTeague's back story in <b>Placer</b> County and relationships with his father, mother and Potter were remembered as a flashback and took two paragraphs. In Stroheim's original Greed, this sequence took up the first hour of the film and was not a flashback. Stroheim also modernized the novel's time span to between 1908 and 1923, a quarter-century later than the novel.|$|E
5|$|Gold {{and silver}} mining. Historically, mercury was used {{extensively}} in hydraulic gold mining {{in order to}} help the gold to sink through the flowing water-gravel mixture. Thin gold particles may form mercury-gold amalgam and therefore increase the gold recovery rates. Large-scale use of mercury stopped in the 1960s. However, mercury is still used in small scale, often clandestine, gold prospecting. It is estimated that 45,000 metric tons of mercury used in California for <b>placer</b> mining have not been recovered. Mercury was also used in silver mining.|$|E

Other cuts included the more suggestive and sexual close-up shots depicting McTeague and Trina's physical attraction to each other, the scenes after McTeague has murdered Trina and roams around San Francisco and <b>Placer</b> County, additional footage of Death Valley, additional footage of Trina with her money, and a more gradual version of Trina's descent into greed and miserly obsession.|$|E
5|$|Lopez {{took the}} gold to {{authorities}} who confirmed its worth. Lopez and others began {{to search for}} other steambeds with gold deposits in the area. They found several in the northeastern section of the forest, within present-day Ventura County. In 1843 he found gold in San Feliciano Canyon near his first discovery. Mexican miners from Sonora worked the <b>placer</b> deposits until 1846, when the Californios began to agitate for independence from Mexico, and the Bear Flag Revolt caused many Mexicans to leave California.|$|E

5|$|Amarte Es un <b>Placer</b> debuted {{at number}} one in Spain, and on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart in the United States. It was {{certified}} gold in the United States, and achieved multi-platinum status in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Spain. The album has sold over three million copies as of 2007. On its release, the record received mixed reviews from music critics; several critics praised {{the production of the}} disc as well as Miguel's vocals and the compositions, while others felt it did not differ from his earlier recordings and found the music outdated. Miguel received several accolades, including a Grammy nomination for Best Latin Pop Performance and the Latin Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album.|$|E
5|$|Anna May Wong's {{parents were}} second-generation Chinese Americans; her {{maternal}} and paternal grandparents had {{resided in the}} U.S. since at least 1855. Her paternal grandfather, A Wong Wong, was a merchant who owned two stores in Michigan Hills, a gold-mining area in <b>Placer</b> County. He had come from Chang On, a village near Taishan, Guangdong Province, China in 1853. Anna May's father spent his youth traveling between the U.S. and China, where he married his first wife and fathered a son in 1890. He returned to the U.S. in the late 1890s and in 1901, while continuing to support his family in China, he married a second wife, Anna May's mother. Anna May's older sister Lew Ying (Lulu) was born in late 1902, and Anna May was born in 1905, followed by five more children.|$|E
5|$|If pure {{platinum}} {{is found}} in <b>placer</b> deposits or other ores, it is isolated from them by various methods of subtracting impurities. Because platinum is significantly denser than many of its impurities, the lighter impurities can be removed by simply floating them away in a liquid. Platinum is paramagnetic, whereas nickel and iron are both ferromagnetic. These two impurities are thus removed by running an electromagnet over the mixture. Because platinum has a higher melting point than most other substances, many impurities can be burned or melted away without melting the platinum. Finally, platinum is resistant to hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, whereas other substances are readily attacked by them. Metal impurities can be removed by stirring the mixture in {{either of the two}} acids and recovering the remaining platinum.|$|E
