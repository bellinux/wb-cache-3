Although conceptual prediction models have apparent advantages in assisting <b>physical</b> <b>understandings</b> of the hydrological process, the spatial and temporal variability of characteristics of watershed {{and the number of}} variables involved in the modeling of the physical processes render them difficult to be manipulated other than by specialists. In this study, two hybrid models, namely, based on genetic algorithm-based artificial neural network and adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system algorithms, are employed for {{flood forecasting}} in a channel reach of the Yangtze River. The new contributions made by this paper are the application of these two algorithms on flood forecasting problems in real prototype cases and the comparison of their performances with a benchmarking linear regression model in this field. It is found that these hybrid algorithms with a “black-box” approach are worthy tools since they not only explore a new solution approach but also demonstrate good accuracy performance.

Infrasound from the 2011 eruption of Nabro Volcano, Eritrea has waveform features highly similar to the "crackle" phenomenon uniquely produced by man-made supersonic jet engines and rockets and is characterized by repeated asymmetric compressions followed by weaker, gradual rarefactions. This infrasonic crackle indicates that infrasound source mechanisms in sustained volcanic eruptions are strikingly similar to jet noise sources from heated, supersonic jet engines and rockets, suggesting that volcanologists can utilize the modeling and <b>physical</b> <b>understandings</b> of man-made jets to understand volcanic jets.

40|$|Methods for fitting {{models to}} mark-recapture-recovery studies are now well {{established}} in the literature. Classical model selection methods for identifying those models which best represent the population under investigation are perhaps less satisfactory. One class of methods implements manual model searches on a model space that is restricted by strong <b>physical</b> <b>understandings</b> of the biological plausibility of each model. This can lead to highly subjective analyses requiring "a priori" expert knowledge, which are slow to implement and can be error prone. More automated search algorithms are now available and can be implemented with ease to consider larger classes of models. We investigate the utility of such automated algorithms and consider in particular the situation {{where there is a}} large set of near optimal models according to the model ranking function. We present a modification of an automated search procedure on an unrestricted model space and propose a procedure for model selection {{in the absence of a}} single clear optimal model. We investigate this approach through a classical mark-recapture-recovery analysis of a red deer population from the island of R�m and conduct an investigation into senesence, which is theorized to occur in wild animal populations.

40|$|Recently, {{there is}} a great {{interest}} in studying ultrasensitive detection and characterization of biomolecules using plasmonic particles, because they are of considerable importance in biomedical science and pharmaceutics. So far, all the theories on plasmoninduced circular dichroism (CD) are based on the dipole approximation, the electric quadrupolar contribution is generally considered to be relatively small and neglected. Here we demonstrate that the electric quadrupolar contribution not only cannot be ignored, but also {{plays a key role in}} many cases. Particularly, for the chiral medium that possesses preferential molecular orientations and is located at the hotspot of plasmonic nanostructures, the plasmonic CD strength contributed by molecular electric quadrupoles (EQ) can be two orders of magnitude higher than that contributed by molecular electric/magnetic dipoles. Unlike the case of dipole approximation, molecular EQ associated plasmonic CD activity appears mainly at the plasmonic resonance absorptions that facilitate the optically enhanced near-field with steep electric filed gradients, and is correlated with the boosted emission rate of a molecular EQ. Based on such <b>physical</b> <b>understandings,</b> we can design nanostructures to realize giant chiroptical effect using the EQ contribution according to the requirements, 2 which provide a new strategy for ultrasensitive detection and quantification of molecular chirality.

40|$|In {{nuclear power}} plants the primary-loop {{recirculation}} (PLR) pump circulates the high temperature/high-pressure coolant in order to remove the thermal energy generated within the reactor. The pump is sealed using the cold purge flow in the shaft seal gap between the rotating shaft and stationary casing, where different forms of Taylor–Couette flow instabilities develop. Due to the temperature difference between the hot recirculating water and the cold purge water (of order of 200 °C), the flow instabilities in the gap cause temperature fluctuations, {{which can lead to}} shaft or casing thermal fatigue cracks. The present work numerically investigated the influence of temperature difference and rotating speed on the structure and dynamics of the Taylor–Couette flow instabilities. The CFD solver used in this study was extensively validated against the experimental data published in the open literature. Influence of temperature difference on the fluid dynamics of Taylor vortices was investigated in this study. With large temperature difference, the structure of the Taylor vortices is greatly stretched at the interface region between the annulus gap and the lower recirculating cavity. Higher temperature difference and rotating speed induce lower fluctuating frequency and smaller circumferential wave number of Taylor vortices. However, the azimuthal wave speed remains unchanged with all the cases tested. The predicted axial location of the maximum temperature fluctuation on the shaft is in a good agreement with the experimental data, identifying the region potentially affected by the thermal fatigue. The <b>physical</b> <b>understandings</b> of such flow instabilities presented in this paper would be useful for future PLR pump design optimization...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} how religious literature represented {{sickness and}} disability in Anglo- Saxon and post-Conquest England. Based on Gospel accounts of Jesus's healings, narratives of miracle-cures were highly valued within medieval Christian culture. By analysing {{a selection of}} miracle-cure narratives from the main period of miracle writing in England, {{from the age of}} Bede to the late twelfth century, this project considers the social significance of such stories. All miracle-cures followed the pattern of a spiritual triumph over the material world, but this thesis focuses on how hagiographers represented human experiences of sickness and disabilities. The first two chapters of this thesis address the conceptual structure of the project. The first explains the two areas of scholarly theory that underpin this thesis. These are the use of narrative sources for historical study; and sociological conceptualisations of bodily difference. The second chapter orientates the case-studies selected for this project in their context. Miracle-cures were recounted in relation to other aspects of the culture of medieval England, most importantly the theology of sainthood and of sin. The remaining three chapters of the thesis provide detailed thematic analysis of selected miracle-cure narratives. The third chapter asks how the spiritual experience of bodily difference was understood. The next chapter considers the <b>physical</b> <b>understandings</b> of a body that was affected by either sickness or disability, and the links between miracle-cure narratives and contemporary medical theory. The fifth and final chapter addresses the representation of social aspects of sickness and disability in these texts, in particular the moralising rhetoric of such texts in favour of community support. This thesis concludes with a discussion of how modern Disability Studies and scholarship on medieval culture benefit from interaction with one another. </p...|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. Associated {{with the}} double ITCZ (Inter-tropical {{convergence}} zone) problem, a dipole SST bias pattern (cold in the equatorial central Pacific and {{warm in the}} southeast tropical Pacific) remains a common problem in current coupled models. Based on a newly-developed model, we demonstrated that a serious consequence of this SST bias is to suppress the thermocline feedback in El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) simulation. Firstly, the excessive cold tongue extension pushes the anomalous convection far westward, diminishing the convection-low level wind feedback and thus the air-sea coupling strength. Secondly, the equatorial surface wind anomaly exhibits weak meridional gradient, leading to a weakened wind-thermocline feedback. Thirdly, the equatorial cold SST bias induces a weakened upper-ocean stratification, yielding the underestimation of the thermocline-subsurface temperature feedback. Finally, the dipole SST bias underestimates the mean upwelling through both dynamic and thermodynamic effects. In recent decades, El Niño events have occurred more frequently over the equatorial central Pacific (CP Warming, CPW). Here, we ascribe this predominance of the CPW to a dramatic decadal change in the Pacific mean state and annual cycle. The mean state change characterized by a decadal La Niña-like pattern tends to anchor convection and surface zonal wind anomalies to {{the vicinity of the}} dateline, facilitating surface warming to occur in the CP. The annual cycle change, with the trade winds intensifying during boreal winter and spring, prevents the warming development but helps the warming decay in the EP. More CPW events are expected in the coming decade if the La-Niña-like pattern persists. The western North Pacific (WNP) Subtropical High (SH) has profound impacts on Asian summer monsoon, North Pacific storms. The cause of the interannual variability of WNPSH, however, remains controversial. Here we show that the anomalous WNPSH is primarily determined by a remote cooling/warming in the equatorial central Pacific and a positive thermodynamic feedback between the local circulation and a dipole sea surface temperature in the Indo-Pacific warm pool. We demonstrate that a physical-empirical prediction model built on these <b>physical</b> <b>understandings</b> has comparable performance with those of three state-of-the-art coupled climate models in re-forecast of the strength of the WNPSH...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} energy {{conversion}} {{laws of the}} macroscopic harmonic LC oscillator, the electromagnetic wave (photon) and the hydrogen atom. As our analysis indicates that the energies of these apparently different systems obey exactly the same energy conversion law. Based on our results and the wave-particle duality of electron, {{we find that the}} atom in fact is a natural microscopic LC oscillator. In the framework of classical electromagnetic field theory we analytically obtain, for the hydrogen atom, the quantized electron orbit radius. Without the adaptation of any other fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, we present a reasonable explanation of the polarization of photon, the Zeeman effect, Selection rules and Pauli exclusion principle. Particularly, it is found that a pairing Pauli electron can move closely and steadily in a DNA-like double helical electron orbit. Our results also reveal an essential connection between electron spin and the intrinsic helical movement of electron and indicate that the spin itself is the effect of quantum confinement. In addition, a possible physical mechanism of superconductivity and the deeper <b>physical</b> <b>understandings</b> of the electron mass, zero point energy, and the hardness property of electron are also provided. Finally, we show analytically that the Dirac's quantization of magnetic monopole is merely a special handed electron at absolute zero-temperature, which strongly suggests that any efforts to seek for the magneticmonopole in real space will be entirely in vain. Furthermore, it appears that the electron's spin and the magnetic monopole are actually two different concepts for one possible physical phenomenon. Comment: 11 pages included 8 figures and 2 tables. The title is changed and new discussions about electron's spin and magnetic monopole are added. We show analytically that the Dirac's quantization of magnetic monopole is merely a special handed electron at absolute zero-temperature with the de Broglie wavelength λ_e= 0.

40|$|Germanium (Ge) is an {{optically}} {{active material}} with the advantages of Si-CMOS compatibility and monolithic integration. It has great potential {{to be used as}} the light emitter for Si photonics. Tensile strain and n-type doping are two key properties in Ge to achieve optical gain. This thesis mainly focuses on: (1) <b>physical</b> <b>understandings</b> of the threshold behavior of Ge-on-Si bulk laser and the temperature dependent performance; (2) process developments to grow and planarize the epitaxial Ge on Si in oxide trenches and corners; (3) introduction of n-type dopant into Ge-on-Si thin films while studying the threading dislocation behavior in n-Ge during annealing; (4) Design an external cavity Ge laser integrated with Si waveguides for a low threshold current and single mode operation. Heavy n-type doping was observed to change the Ge electronic band structure by band gap narrowing effect. We also found a failure of using a simple Drude model to explain free carrier absorption in n-Ge. We modified the optical gain simulation based on the above two observations in Ge. We found a broad gain bandwidth of ~ 200 nm from 1550 nm to 1750 nm and a higher net materials gain. We predicted a theoretical lasing threshold current density of 5 ~ 10 kA/cm² in the bulk Ge laser device with the n-type doping of mid- 10 ¹⁹ cm-³ at room temperature. We also predicted the Ge laser device would have better temperature stability regarding the threshold current compared to the III-V laser. Single crystalline Ge was epitaxial grown on Si in oxide trenches using ultra high vacuum chemical vapor deposition. The selective growth lead to the faceting in Ge because of the different growth rates of crystal orientations. We developed a suitable photolithography and oxide etch process to get the vertical oxide sidewall for Ge trench filling. We also tested the Ge growth in the T-shape corners to improve the reflectivity at the waveguide end. The T-shape structure was also useful for the Ge/Si waveguide coupling in the external cavity laser. Furthermore, we developed a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process for the over-grown Ge waveguides. The Ge CMP process was selective to oxide, flexible to change in the CMP rate by DI water dilution and controllable for a minimum dishing of Ge in the oxide trenches. N-type doping helped to increase the direct band transition in Ge for light emission. We developed a delta-doping method to grow a dopant source called "delta doping layer" on the single crystalline Ge layer without introducing extra defects. We then used rapid thermal annealing to drive the dopant into the underlying Ge layer. The dopant enhanced diffusion was discovered to speed up the drive-in process. The active n-type concentration in Ge could reach up to 5 × 10 ¹⁹ cm- 3 using the delta doping source and annealing process. Since the dopant source layer had a disrupted Ge growth, we used the developed CMP process to remove it after the dopant drive-in. A comprehensive dopant diffusion simulation was developed to predict the annealing temperature and time to achieve high n-type doping and uniform distribution. We used plan-view transmission electron microscopy to examine the threading dislocation density (TDD) in n-Ge for both blanket films and trench grown waveguides. We found a high TDD of ~ 1 × 10 ⁸cm-² in 1 [mu]m thick blanket Ge with doping of 3 × 10 ¹⁸ cm-³ after high temperature annealing at 850 °C for 40 min. The TDD is 1 × 10 ⁹ cm-² in the 300 nm thick and 1 [mu]m wide Ge waveguide. We examined the effects of annealing temperature, Ge thickness, Si/Ge inter-diffusion and trench width on the threading dislocation behavior. However, we have not found the exact reason causing the high TDD and therefore, further study is required on the TDD reduction for the Ge waveguide. Finally, we designed an external cavity Ge laser using distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) gratings on Si waveguides. A detailed discussion on the cross section design was presented to mitigate the internal optical loss from claddings and metal layers and to improve the current injection uniformity across the Ge waveguide. The aim of the DBR grating design was to achieve a single mode operation by controlling the full width half maximum of the grating reflectance spectrum. We also discussed the coupling between Ge and Si waveguides and different designs were presented to increase the coupling efficiency. by Yan Cai. Thesis: Ph.
