5|$|In 1955 the Howitt {{report on}} the {{development}} of <b>pig</b> <b>production</b> in the United Kingdom was published. Its main conclusions were that UK pig farms were poorly placed to compete with European producers, that the diversity of local breeds in the UK was an obstacle to progress, and that British pig farmers should focus on three breeds only: the Welsh, the British Landrace, and the Large White. The report initiated a period of decline in all other British pig breeds, including the Large Black. By the time the Rare Breeds Survival Trust was founded 1973, numbers of all traditional pig breeds were dangerously low, and many of them were extinct. The Large Black was placed on the Trust's endangered list.|$|E

25|$|Meat {{producers}} {{may seek}} {{to improve the}} fertility of female animals through the administration of gonadotrophic or ovulation-inducing hormones. In <b>pig</b> <b>production,</b> sow infertility is a common problem — possibly due to excessive fatness. No methods currently exist to augment the fertility of male animals. Artificial insemination is now routinely used to produce animals of the best possible genetic quality, and the efficiency of this method is improved through the administration of hormones that synchronize the ovulation cycles within groups of females.|$|E

25|$|There were 281 local pig {{farms and}} 205 local poultry farms in 2004. During 2003, local <b>pig</b> <b>production</b> was valued at $527 million and local poultry production, {{including}} pigeons and eggs was valued at $250 million. Pigs raised on local farms are crosses derived from Duroc, Landrace and Large White parent stock. The majority of local chickens raised on farms are Shek Ki cross bred chickens.

30|$|The farmers realise the {{importance}} of diseases and reproductive efficiency on cattle production and herd building thereby ranking high TDR and RE of cows. The highodds ratios of older farmers with regard to TDR and RE in breeding cows maybe because theywere experienced with cattle production and know that unproductive and diseased animals are a liability to the enterprise (Minjauw and McLeod, 2003). Roessleret al. (2008) observed a similar trend in ranking high adaptive traits in <b>pig</b> <b>productions</b> under smallholder resource-driven production systems while demand-driven production systems concentrated most on productive traits, and maintaining adaptive and functional traits. The low-input production system of the Nguni cattle small-scale enterprises behaved {{in a manner of}} a demand-driven system, while communal enterprises followed the resource-driven system. This was also observed by Madzimure et al. (2012) in a study of using indigenous pigs in subsistence-oriented and market-oriented small-scale farming systems in South Africa.|$|R
