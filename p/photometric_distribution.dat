Density matching is a tracking method which operates by maximizing the Bhattacharyya similarity measure between the <b>photometric</b> <b>distribution</b> from an estimated image region {{and a model}} <b>photometric</b> <b>distribution.</b> Such trackers can be expressed as PDE-based curve evolutions, which can be implemented using level sets.

We perform a chi-squared minimization between the observed <b>photometric</b> <b>distribution</b> and a model <b>photometric</b> <b>distribution,</b> based on theoretical isochrones. The initial mass function, distance modulus, interstellar reddening, binary fraction and photometric errors are incorporated into the model, making it directly comparable to the data. The model is a linear combination of individual synthetic color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), each of which represents the predicted <b>photometric</b> <b>distribution</b> of a stellar population of a given age and metallicity. We present extensive tests of the algorithm, using both simulated and actual photometric data. From a preliminary application of the algorithm to a subregion of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), {{we find that the}} that the lull in star formation observed among the LMC's cluster population between 3 and 8 Gyr ago is also present in the field population.

This contribution introduces a liver segmentation method {{from a series}} of computer tomography images. Overall, we present a novel method for segmenting liver by coupling density matching with shape priors. Density matching signifies a tracking method which operates via maximizing the Bhattacharyya similarity measure between the <b>photometric</b> <b>distribution</b> from an estimated image region and a model <b>photometric</b> <b>distribution.</b> Density matching controls the direction of the evolution process and slows down the evolving contour in regions with weak edges. The shape prior improves the robustness of density matching and discourages the evolving contour from exceeding liver's boundaries at regions with weak boundaries. The model is implemented using a modified distance regularized level set (DRLS) model. The experimental results show that the method achieves a satisfactory result. By comparing with the original DRLS model, it is evident that the proposed model herein is more effective in addressing the over segmentation problem.

40|$|When {{considering}} {{the replacement of}} incandescent lamps by screwbase integrated compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), we must ensure that the CFL will provide satisfaction to the users {{in order to avoid}} the hark-back to the inefficient technology of incandescent lamps. One of the possible reasons of the users’ disappointment is the perception of the quantity of the luminous flux of these lamps. The first cause of this bad perception is the lamp <b>photometric</b> <b>distribution</b> which can affect the illuminance of the task areas and the background environment. The second is the time it takes before the nominal flux of the lamp is reached. The first objective of this paper is to analyze the time required for different CFL to reach their nominal flux. While some lamps start rapidly (1. 5 minutes to reach 90 % of the nominal flux), others require a very long delay to reach their nominal flux and to stabilize (more than 15 minutes to reach 90 % of the nominal flux). This delay is difficult to foresee and differences appears even for same type of lamp (model and brand), for different powers. The second objective of this paper is to determine the <b>photometric</b> <b>distribution</b> of various types of CFLs. While quad and three tubes lamps have very different photometric curves (radiating more horizontally than vertically) compared to incandescent bulbs, the photometry of CFL with bulbs is very similar to the photometry of incandescent lamps.

The star count surface densities and deprojected inclination for both young and older populations are generally consistent with previous work. We fit the projected density with an exponential disk or spherical power-law model with an optional two-dimensional elliptical bar. The derived disk scale length is R = 1. 42 ± 0. 01 kpc for models without the bar and R = 2. 15 ± 0. 01 kpc for models with the bar included. The median value for the bar axis ratio is q = 3. 4 for intermediate and old LMC populations and q = 4. 1 for young populations. The radial profile shows evidence for disk truncation near 3 kpc.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The liver {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} organs in the human body. It carries out a variety of functions including filtering the blood, making bile and proteins, processing sugar, breaking down medications, and storing iron, minerals, and vitamins. However, the liver is prone to many diseases such as hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and cancer. As computer science and technology advances, computer-aided surgical planning systems have played an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases. These systems can present the structures of various liver vessels, generate resection proposals, offer 3 D visualizations, provide surgical cutting simulations, and shorter planning times. However, among these systems, one of the most challenging issues is the accurate segmentation of the liver from its surrounding organs in computed tomography images. Factors contributing to the challenge in carrying out accurate liver segmentation include the similar intensity values between adjacent organs, geometrically complex liver structure, and the injection of contrast media that causes all tissues to have similar gray-level values. Several artefacts of pulsation and motion, and partial volume effects, also increase difficulties for automatic liver segmentation in computed tomography images. Significant individual variations in shape and volume of the liver also add to the difficulties. Therefore, liver segmentation from medical images remains an open problem. In this research, we aim to perform accurate and automatic 3 D liver segmentation from the latest multi-slice spiral/helical computed tomography (CT) scans, an achievement which would be very useful for computer-aided surgical planning systems. The development and evaluation of a clinically applicable segmentation algorithm, and its integration into software that could be used by medical experts, represents the major focus of the thesis. Level set methods have been widely used in medical image segmentation and perform well in segmenting irregularly shaped objects such as the liver. However, level set methods fail to segment meaningful objects from images if the objects are occluded by other objects, if some parts have low contrast (or are even missing), or if the target object has similar intensity values to adjacent objects. Since all these factors exist in the case of the liver, classical level set methods are not well suited to accurately segment the liver from abdominal CT scans. In this thesis, the enhanced level set method has been modified to make it suitable for segmenting the liver from an abdominal CT scan. We have improved the level set method to enable segmentation of the liver parenchyma from CT images by introducing a priori knowledge about the liver into the level set framework. These improvements make it possible to distinguish unclear liver boundaries, prevent surrounding organs from confusing the boundaries, and enhance segmentation performance. An important aspect of our improvements is that implementation of the necessary prior knowledge is not long or difficult compared to other segmentation methods. In initial exploratory work, the novel liver segmentation algorithm we first developed used the level set method together with an intensity prior (IP). The IP model improved the level set method by adding a priori statistical knowledge about the intensity distribution inside and outside the liver to the level set framework. The main merits of this approach were found to be its strong ability to dynamically guide the direction of the evolving contour and prevent it from leaking into regions with unclear boundaries. Examples of applying the proposed IP algorithm on real computed tomography images are presented. We show that the proposed method can deliver superior segmentation compared to the distance-regularized level set (DRLS) method. The average accuracy values for the IP model and the DRLS model are 99 % and 89 %, respectively. However, the IP model does have some limitations. We need to train the algorithm on liver slices that have a very similar intensity distribution to the target. This indicates that the statistical learning applied a priori in the training stage cannot be generally transferred to a large range of liver slices. Consequently, the method is not capable of segmenting a sequence of liver slices and building a complete liver volume. This motivated us to develop a liver segmentation algorithm which used the level set method together with density matching and a shape prior (DMSP). The DMSP model we developed provides accurate and automatic 3 D liver segmentation from abdominal CT images. The algorithm is novel in that it combines density matching with prior knowledge about the liver shape. Density matching is a tracking method which maximizes the Bhattacharyya similarity measure between the <b>photometric</b> <b>distribution</b> inside the evolving curve and a model <b>photometric</b> <b>distribution</b> learned a priori. Density matching provides adaptive shrinkage or expansion to the evolving contour, while the shape prior improves robustness of the density matching and discourages the evolving contour from exceeding liver boundaries at regions which are unclear. For the purpose of comparison, we improved the IP model by adding a shape prior to its framework, producing an intensity prior and shape prior model, or IPSP model. However, even with this modification, the learning of the a priori statistical model applied during the training stage could still not correctly allow a liver volume to be reconstructed from a sequence of liver slices. Comparison experiments have shown that the DMSP model outperformed the IPSP model and performed well for all the investigated liver cases in our test data. The average overlap values for the IPSP model and the DMSP model were 76 % and 91 %, respectively. We compared the DMSP model with several other reported methods: the density matching (DM) model, the overlap prior (OP) model, and the DRLS method. Comparisons showed that the proposed method achieved better performance than any of these aforementioned approaches. The proposed method was shown to be more effective in overcoming over- and under-segmentation problems. The average overlap values of segmentation (compared to the ground truth) were estimated to be 69 %, 77 %, 63 %, and 93 % for the DM model, OP model, DRLS model, and DMSP model, respectively. Since the DMSP model achieves better performance than previous analogous studies, it has the potential to be used in clinical practice or in a computer-aided surgical planning system...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceFred L. HaslerThis paper {{discusses}} {{the potential of}} using LED modules as the primary light source for office buildings’ lighting systems. The LED lamps are the newest mass-produced lamps today; they have many insurmountable advantages compared to other light sources, like long lamp life, high efficacy, and low heat emission. Because of these advantages, owners and occupants of buildings can benefit greatly from the application of LED luminaires. The main focus {{of this paper is}} in 4 categories, which include the reliability of published data, occupant comfort, energy efficiency, and the life cycle costs of building lighting systems. LED light sources are compared to other primary light sources, which include fluorescent and incandescent lamps, of low ceiling office spaces from these 4 categories. The reliability of published data discussion covers color rendering index (CRI), correlated color temperatures (CCT), lamp life, and efficacy of the different type of lamps. The criteria of LED lamps are the most emphasized point of this section. The current CRI, efficacy, and lamp life evaluation systems are not suitable for LED lamps, and this paper {{discusses the}} practical value of each of these published data in office lighting system design. Some technical reports presented in this paper show that high CRI values of LED light sources do not directly link to excellent color rendition. However, LED light sources can have similar spectrum power distributions as natural light, and offer adequate visual comfort. Efficacy and lamp life are in the same situation. Even though, the published values do not necessarily reflect the real life performance of LED lamps, they often still have the longest lamp life and highest efficacy. Human comfort is the second factor discussed. Engineers and lighting designers consider illuminance level, color rendering ability, and glare of lighting systems to be deciding factors of human comfort from a lighting design perspective. However, many medical studies show that the human is much more sensitive to the correlated color of light sources. Light sources must vary output luminous flux and correlated color temperatures over time to help occupants reach optimum office task productivity and maintain health and visual comfort. LED lamps are the only light source that can practically change both the output luminous flux and correlate color temperature without heavy extra investments in equipment, which makes it the perfect candidate for this category. Energy efficiency is the third discussion point presented in this paper. Efficacy is a widely adopted term for evaluating the energy efficiency of a lamp, which describes the ratio of the output illuminance and input power. Because the output illuminance of LED lamps is decided not only by the illuminant bodies, but also many other electronic components in the lamps, some experts suggest that using efficacy to judge LED lamps is biased. This paper states the author’s position on whether efficacy can adequately describe the efficiency of LED lamps. Costs are also an inevitable point of this paper. LED lamps have the reputation of being the most expensive type of light source, but marketing data shows that the price of LEDs has been dropping dramatically recently. Moreover, Haitz’s law predicts that the price of LEDs will drop even more in the future. In this paper, the lifecycle costs of a light system have also been addressed across different types of light sources. Some crucial drawbacks of LED lamps, such as narrow <b>photometric</b> <b>distribution</b> and thermal damage control, are also addressed in this paper. Scientists and engineers still have not found the perfect solution to these drawbacks, but they are not significant enough to jeopardize the application of LED lamps in most architectural lighting design cases. According to the finding of this paper, LED lamps are the mainstream light source of future office lighting systems. The author also gives some suggestions for using LED lamps as primary light sources in office lighting system design applications {{at the end of the}} paper...|$|E

These errors are caused by photometric scatter, as well as systematic errors in the templates, filter curves, and photometric zeropoints. We also parametrize the <b>photometric</b> redshift error <b>distribution</b> with a sum of Gaussians, and use this model to deconvolve the errors from the measured <b>photometric</b> redshift <b>distribution</b> to estimate the true redshift distribution. We pay special attention to the stability of this deconvolution, regularizing the method with a prior on the smoothness of the true redshift distribution. The methods we develop are applicable to general photometric redshift surveys. Comment: 15 pages, 12 figs, matches version accepted by MNRA...|$|R
40|$|The {{low energy}} spectra of some gamma-ray bursts' show excess {{components}} beside the power-law dependence. The {{consequences of such}} a feature allows to estimate the gamma photometric redshift of the long gamma-ray bursts in the BATSE Catalog. There is good correlation between the measured optical and the estimated gamma photometric redshifts. The estimated redshift values for the long bright gamma-ray bursts are up to z= 4, while for the the faint long bursts - which should be up to z= 20 - the redshifts cannot be determined unambiguously with this method. The redshift distribution of all the gamma-ray bursts with known optical redshift agrees quite well with the BATSE based gamma <b>photometric</b> redshift <b>distribution.</b> Comment: published in Baltic Astronom...|$|R
40|$|Aims. We {{study the}} dwarf {{spheroidal}} {{galaxies in the}} nearby M 81 group in order to construct their <b>photometric</b> metallicity <b>distributions</b> and to investigate the potential presence of population gradients. We select all the dwarf spheroidals with available Hubble Space Telescope / Advanced Camera for Surveys archival observations, nine in total. Methods. We interpolate isochrones so as to assign a photometric metallicity to each star within a selection box in the color-magnitude diagram of each dwarf galaxy. We assume that the dwarf spheroidals contain mainly an old stellar population. In order to search for metallicity gradients, we examine the spatial distribution of two stellar populations that we separate according to their metallicities. Results. As a result, we present the <b>photometric</b> metallicity <b>distribution</b> functions, the cumulative histograms and smoothed density maps of the metal-poor and metal-rich stars {{as well as of}} the intermediate-age stars. Conclusions. From our photometric data we find that all the dwarf spheroidals show a wide range in metallicities, with mean values that are typical for old and metal-poor systems, with the exception of one dwarf spheroidal, namely IKN. Some of our dwarf spheroidals exhibit characteristics of transition-type dwarfs. Compared to the Local Group transition type dwarfs, the M 81 group ones appear to have mean metallicity values slightly more metal-rich at a given luminosity. All the dwarf spheroidals considered here appear to exhibit either population gradients or spatial variations in the centroids of their metal-poor and metal-rich population. In addition, there are luminous AGB stars detected in all of them with spatial distributions suggesting that they are well mixed with the old stars...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} stellar {{metallicity}} distribution {{function of the}} Galactic halo based on SDSS ugriz photometry. A set of stellar isochrones is calibrated using observations of several star clusters and validated by comparisons with medium-resolution spectroscopic values {{over a wide range}} of metal abundance. We estimate distances and metallicities for individual main-sequence stars in the multiply scanned SDSS Stripe 82, at heliocentric distances in the range 5 - 8 kpc and |b| > 35 °, and find that the in situ <b>photometric</b> metallicity <b>distribution</b> has a shape that matches that of the kinematically selected local halo stars from Ryan & Norris. We also examine independent kinematic information from proper-motion measurements for high Galactic latitude stars in our sample. We find that stars with retrograde rotation in the rest frame of the Galaxy are generally more metal poor than those exhibiting prograde rotation, which is consistent with earlier arguments by Carollo et al. that the halo system comprises at least two spatially overlapping components with differing metallicity, kinematics, and spatial <b>distributions.</b> The observed <b>photometric</b> metallicity <b>distribution</b> and that of Ryan & Norris can be described by a simple chemical evolution model by Hartwick (or by a single Gaussian distribution); however, the suggestive metallicity-kinematic correlation contradicts the basic assumption in this model that the Milky Way halo consists primarily of a single stellar population. When the observed metallicity distribution is deconvolved using two Gaussian components with peaks at [Fe/H] ≈- 1. 7 and - 2. 3, the metal-poor component accounts for ∼ 20 %- 35 % of the entire halo population in this distance range. 23 page(s...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new pipeline for mapping dark matter associated with clusters of galaxies via weak gravitational lensing. This method will be useful both with current datasets and future large optical survey telescopes, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). We use a novel source finding technique using a wavelet detection method. We then find known photometric and spectroscopic redshifts associated with our sources and measure the ellipticities of galaxies using a second moment technique. The ellipticity and <b>photometric</b> redshift <b>distribution</b> are then converted to a dark matter map. We have represented the dark matter as smoothed particles to invert the ellipticity map. This had yielded both 2 D and 3 D dark matter distributions when applied to our Subaru archive image of Abell 2218. ...|$|R

We then classify the sources by assigning them to the distribution to which they are most likely to belong.
