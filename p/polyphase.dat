5|$|Born {{and raised}} in the Austrian Empire, Tesla {{received}} an advanced education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. He emigrated to the United States in 1884, where he would become a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related <b>polyphase</b> AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the <b>polyphase</b> system which that company would eventually market.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, Tesla {{developed}} an induction motor that ran on alternating current, a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States {{because of its}} advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used <b>polyphase</b> current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.|$|E
5|$|In July 1888, Brown and Peck {{negotiated}} a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla's <b>polyphase</b> induction motor and transformer designs for $60,000 {{in cash and}} stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor. Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year for the large fee of $2,000 ($ in today's dollars) per month to be a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company's Pittsburgh labs.|$|E
5000|$|Layer II/MP2 is a time-domain encoder. It uses a low-delay 32 {{sub-band}} <b>polyphased</b> {{filter bank}} for time-frequency mapping; having overlapping ranges (i.e. <b>polyphased)</b> to prevent aliasing. [...] The psychoacoustic model {{is based on}} the principles of auditory masking, simultaneous masking effects, and the absolute threshold of hearing (ATH). The size of a Layer II frame is fixed at 1152-samples (coefficients).|$|R
5000|$|MP3 {{does not}} benefit from the 32 {{sub-band}} <b>polyphased</b> filter bank, instead just using an 18-point MDCT transformation on each output to split the data into 576 frequency components, and processing it in the frequency domain. [...] This extra [...] allows MP3 to have a much finer psychoacoustic model, and more carefully apply appropriate quantization to each band, providing much better low-bitrate performance.|$|R
40|$|Brushless motors (<b>polyphased</b> AC induction, {{synchronous}} and brushless DC motors) have no alternatives {{in modern}} electric drives. They possess highly efficient and very {{wide range of}} speeds. The objective {{of this paper is}} to represent some relation between the basic parameters and magnitudes of electrical machines. This allows to be made a comparative analysis and a choice of motor concerning each particular case based not only on catalogue data or price for sale...|$|R
25|$|Fibonacci {{numbers are}} used in a <b>polyphase</b> version of the merge sort {{algorithm}} in which an unsorted list {{is divided into two}} lists whose lengths correspond to sequential Fibonacci numbers– by dividing the list so that the two parts have lengths in the approximate proportion φ. A tape-drive implementation of the <b>polyphase</b> merge sort was described in The Art of Computer Programming.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{extensive}} investigations of phase modulation for pulse compression schemes, such as biphase (binary Phase shift keying) and <b>polyphase</b> coding methods, but {{this work is}} not considered here.|$|E
25|$|An {{induction}} motor is an asynchronous AC motor where power {{is transferred to}} the rotor by electromagnetic induction, much like transformer action. An {{induction motor}} resembles a rotating transformer, because the stator (stationary part) is essentially the primary side of the transformer and the rotor (rotating part) is the secondary side. <b>Polyphase</b> induction motors are widely used in industry.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAll {{individual}} {{phases of}} the ternary Cr–C–N system including stable and metastable ones can be deposited at low temperature by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). These growth processes are mainly based {{on the use of}} bis(benzene) chromium as chromium source and various co-reactives. Then, from a good control of the reactive gas phase, it is possible to combine these MOCVD processes to grow in the same reactor protective coatings designed with a complex architecture based on <b>polyphased,</b> nanostructured or multilayer structure which exhibit enhanced properties. These deposition processes are described and the main features of the coatings are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The <b>polyphased</b> Kačák Episode {{near the}} Eifelian-Givetian {{boundary}} (Middle Devonian), well documented globally, resembles other global biotic extinction events driven by climate change. High-resolution conodont biodiversity patterns from shallow marine, slope and pelagic bathymetric settings {{within the same}} basin from the Carnic Alps showthatwhile conodonts experienced diversification during the latest Eifelian ensensis Biozone, assemblages suffered extinction during the early Givetian hemiansatus Biozone. Although a similar general pattern is observed in different bathymetric settings there is a changed taxonomic composition of conodont assemblages across the stage boundary. Based on microfacies analysis this change is contemporaneous with changes in palaeoenvironmental conditions in the earliest Givetian...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Orientation {{distributions}} of <b>polyphased</b> (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 +δ superconducting textured materials are determined from neutron diffraction analysis. The quantitative texture analysis of neutron data {{was accomplished by}} using the combined Rietveld-WIMV-Popa algorithms, implemented in the program package Materials Analysis Using Diffraction (MAUD). Curved position-sensitive detector and 4 -circle diffractometry allow the whole diffraction pattern treatment. Transport critical current densities, measured on different samples, are strongly dependent of the calculated texture strengths, crystallite sizes and phase ratios. The results prove {{the interest of the}} combined approach for a quantitative texture analysis of complex materials. Texture to anisotropic physical properties relationship is discussed...|$|R
25|$|The {{power factor}} in a {{single-phase}} circuit (or balanced three-phase circuit) can be measured with the wattmeter-ammeter-voltmeter method, where the power in watts is divided by the product of measured voltage and current. The power factor of a balanced <b>polyphase</b> circuit {{is the same as}} that of any phase. The power factor of an unbalanced poly phase circuit is not uniquely defined.|$|E
25|$|Rectifier locomotives, {{which used}} AC power {{transmission}} and DC motors, were common, though DC commutators had problems both in starting and at low velocities. Today's advanced electric locomotives use brushless three-phase AC induction motors. These <b>polyphase</b> machines are powered from GTO-, IGCT- or IGBT-based inverters. The cost of electronic devices {{in a modern}} locomotive can be up to 50% {{of the cost of}} the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} AC {{induction}} and synchronous motors is optimized for operation on single-phase or <b>polyphase</b> sinusoidal or quasi-sinusoidal waveform power such as supplied for fixed-speed application from the AC power grid or for variable-speed application from VFD controllers. An AC motor has two parts: a stationary stator having coils supplied with AC {{to produce a}} rotating magnetic field, and a rotor attached to the output shaft that is given a torque by the rotating field.|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{detailed}} field investigations {{carried out in the}} frame of the new Italian geological mapping project (sheet n. 29, Cortina d'Ampezzo) as well as of previous similar researches of the surrounding areas, it was possible to reconstruct a complete structural framework of a broad area within the central-eastern Dolomites. In particular, the major tectonic structures the affect the area have been identified and characterised from a geometric, kinematic, dynamic and chronological point of view. The numerous meso- and macro-scale field observations and measurements allowed also to confirm the <b>polyphased</b> behaviour of the deformation, to reconstruct the local tectonics within the regional frame separating the principal Tertiary tectonic phases, either pre-, syn- and post-orogenic paroxims...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA general {{overview}} of radio receivers and transmitters is presented. Introducing {{the principle of}} frequency translation, classical heterodyne and homodyne RX and TX architectures for analog telecommunications are discussed. Digital telecommunications are addressed and, with them, modern <b>polyphased</b> transceiver architectures and the insertion of an ADC within the receiver chain. First the ADC is considered at the baseband level, then at higher frequency stages, {{and up to the}} antenna yielding to the ultimate Software Defined Radio (SDR) principle. At each location of the ADC within the receiver chain, the converter characteristics are reviewed, leading to the choice of a possible architecture. Nonidealities are discussed in order to highlight problems that researchers will have to address in the future to fulfill the SDR concept...|$|R
40|$|The {{area between}} Golo and Tavignano valleys (Lat. 42 ° 20 ’N, Long. 9 ° 10 ’E) in Central Corsica is {{characterized}} by the occurrence of continental metamorphic units belonging to the Lower Units of the Alpine Corsica. These units, also known as Corte Slices, represent the fragments of the European continental margin involved in the continental subduction and the subsequent collision, both resulting from the closure of the Ligure-Piemontese oceanic Basin. These units are thus characterized by a complex <b>polyphased</b> deformation history developed under blueschists to greenschists metamorphic facies conditions during the Late Eocene - Early Miocene time span. In the study area, the Corte Slices have been investigated by a multidisciplinary approach consisting of a detailed mapping associated to meso- and microstructural analyses and estimate of the P-T conditions of the metamorphic events. The 1 : 10. 000 scale geological map illustrates the results of this approach that has provided a detailed snapshot of the stratigraphic and structural analysis of the Corte Slices (Di Rosa et al., 2017). The structural setting of the area {{is characterized by}} a <b>polyphased</b> deformation history: within the Corte Slices, three folding phases are recognized at all the scale of observation (D 1, D 2 and D 3). The D 1 produces F 1 sheath folds and a S 1 foliation, almost completely transposed by the D 2 phase that is characterized by F 2 isoclinal folds with a subvertical axial plain foliation, a S 2 foliation and an L 2 stretching lineation. The D 3 phase is associated to F 3 folds with a subhorizontal axial plain foliation. A post-D 3 brittle deformation phase is associated to the Central Corsica Shear Zone (CCSZ), a strike-slip faults system that cuts all the previous structures...|$|R
25|$|Steadfast in his {{promotion}} of three-phase development, Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky invented the three-phase cage-rotor induction motor in 1889 and the three-limb transformer in 1890. This type of motor is now {{used for the}} vast majority of commercial applications. However, he claimed that Tesla's motor was not practical because of two-phase pulsations, which prompted him to persist in his three-phase work. Although Westinghouse achieved its first practical induction motor in 1892 and developed a line of <b>polyphase</b> 60 hertz induction motors in 1893, these early Westinghouse motors were two-phase motors with wound rotors until B. G. Lamme developed a rotating bar winding rotor.|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} Westinghouse {{continued}} to pour money and engineering resources into {{the goal of}} building a completely integrated AC system, obtaining the Sawyer–Man lamp by buying Consolidated Electric Light, developing components such as an induction meter, and obtaining the rights to inventor Nikola Tesla's brushless AC induction motor along with patents for {{a new type of}} electric power distribution, <b>polyphase</b> alternating current. The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent for his system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while.|$|E
25|$|Plug and socket systems {{intended}} for high current, high voltage or <b>polyphase</b> industrial equipment, {{as well as}} additional contacts and larger contacts, may also include features to improve the security and safety of use. For example, a high-power plug may include a locking ring or twist-lock feature to prevent accidental disconnection in use. A socket may include a mechanical interlock that prevents insertion or removal of a plug unless the local safety disconnecting switch is open. Plugs may include special measures to contain an arc generated during disconnection. Plugs used for equipment in wet locations (such as mines) may include small supervisory contacts that check {{the integrity of the}} earthing conductor.|$|E
40|$|Modern shore {{platforms}} {{developed on}} rocky coasts are key areas for understanding coastal erosion processes during the Holocene. This contribution offers a detailed picture of two contrasted shore-platform systems, based on new high-resolution shallow-water bathymetry, further coupled with aerial LiDAR topography. Merged land-sea digital elevation models were achieved on two distinct types of rocky coasts {{along the eastern}} English Channel in France (Picardy and Upper-Normandy: PUN) and in a NE Atlantic area (SW Brittany: SWB) in NW France. About the PUN case, submarine steps, identified as paleo-shorelines, parallel the actual coastline. Coastal erosive processes appear to be continuous and regular through time, since mid-Holocene at least. In SWB, there is a discrepancy between contemporary coastline orientation and a continuous step extending from inland to offshore, identified as a paleo-shoreline. This illustrates a <b>polyphased</b> and inherited shore platform edification, mainly controlled by tectonic processes...|$|R
40|$|The epicentral {{area of the}} 2002 San Giuliano (Molise, Italy) {{earthquake}} {{has been}} largely investigated for better understanding the important site effects observed. Among the several approaches that have been applied, in this short note we present {{the results of a}} detailed geological-structural mapping and of a gravimetric survey. The former methodological approach allowed to reconstruct the superficial and shallow geology of the area documenting a <b>polyphased</b> tectonics characterised by several low-angle, NW-SE trending, NE-vergent thrust units cut by NNW-SSE trending both negative and positive flower structures. On the other hand, the geophysical approach allowed to confirm the superficial geological inferences and to constrain at greater depth the 3 D geology, both in term of sedimentary and tectonic distribution. The results of this integrated analysis were then used for numerical modelling simulating the ground accelaration within the epicentral area...|$|R

25|$|The first {{attempts}} to use standard-frequency single-phase AC {{were made in}} Hungary {{as far back as}} 1923, by the Hungarian Kálmán Kandó on the line between Budapest-Nyugati and Alag, using 16kV at 50Hz. The locomotives carried a four-pole rotating phase converter feeding a single traction motor of the <b>polyphase</b> induction type at 600 to 1,100V. The number of poles on the 2,500hp motor could be changed using slip rings to run at one of four synchronous speeds. The tests were a success so, from 1932 until the 1960s, trains on the Budapest-Hegyeshalom line (towards Vienna) regularly used the same system. A few decades after the Second World War, the 16kV was changed to the Russian and later French 25kV system.|$|E
25|$|The {{area had}} {{undergone}} <b>polyphase</b> deformation. The planar S0, {{is defined by}} the layering within chemogenic precipitate (BIF). The earliest folds F1, apart from being tight and appressed occur in intrafolial positions and also constitute the rootless folds. This folding has given rise to an axial planar penetrative foliation and is defined mainly by hornblende and to a lesser extend by chlorite and is co-parallel to the lithoboundaries identified as S0. S1 schistosity is defined by hornblende and chlorite, and this mineralogical association suggests that the deformation occurred under upper greenschist to lower amphibolite facies conditions. The subsequent F2 resulted in refolding of S1 and transposition of S1 subparallel to the F2 axial trace. The most prominent planar structures are the discrete mylonitic foliation S2 attributed the regional NE-SW trending Bhavani shear. Mylonite development, biotitization, chloritization and microgranulation are found associated with these surfaces.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1893, Westinghouse engineer Benjamin Lamme had made great progress developing an efficient version of Tesla's induction motor, and Westinghouse Electric started branding their complete <b>polyphase</b> AC system as the [...] "Tesla <b>Polyphase</b> System". They believed that Tesla's patents gave them patent priority over other AC systems.|$|E
40|$|In the Western French Massif Central, the Argentat {{fault is}} a major {{structure}} through which As–Au fluids percolated in the Late Carboniferous along brittle fractures. New petrostructural investigations show that an early ductile normal-dextral faulting, coeval to leucogranite emplacement {{took place during the}} Late Visean syncollisional extension of the belt and was accompanied by a hydrothermal event marked by the growth of muscovites whose 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages cluster around 335 Ma. This early fluid channelling is associated with brittle deformation only in the hangingwall of the Argentat fault, whereas ductile deformation is restricted to the footwall. These results provide new evidence for the upper crust implication during the syncollisional extension in the French Massif Central. This study stresses the interest of a detailed multimethod analysis to characterize hydrothermal processes, especially in basement areas where the tectonic, plutonic and metamorphic evolution is <b>polyphased...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{similarity}} between the geometry of the West African and South American coastlines is among {{one of the strongest}} natural observations supporting the plate tectonic paradigm. However, using classical plate tectonic approaches to model these conjugate transform margins results in a high degree of variability in palaeogeographic reconstructions. Using state-of-the-art 3 D coupled thermo-mechanical numerical models, we simulate for the first time, crustal deformation at the onset of oceanisation along large offset oblique margins. Our models show that obliquity causes oceanic rift propagation to stall, resulting in an apparent <b>polyphased</b> tectonic evolution, and in some circumstances leads to the formation of hyper-extended margins. As a result, conjugate margins located at the edge of future fracture zones are highly asymmetric from rifting to spreading, with their lengths differing by a factor of 5 to 10, before the the final phase of break-up occurs. Accounting for this discrepancy should ameliorate future palaeogeographic reconstructions...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePseudotachylytes, cataclasites and mylonites {{have been}} {{reported}} from gabbros, peridotites and meta-sedimentary rocks from {{the western part of}} the Ivrea-Verbano zone in the vicinity of the so-called Canavese Line (Schmid et al., Tectonophysics, 1987; Techmer et al., Tectonophysics, 1992). This contribution aims at clarifying the distribution and the relative/absolute chronology of these fault rocks, in order to reconstruct a rheological (seismogenic-non seismogenic) evolution of the Ivrea crustal section. First results indicate that pseudotachylyte formation is <b>polyphased.</b> Two main stages can be distinguished: one pre-dating Ivrea mylonite formation, the other post-dating it. Each of the main stages can be further divided in several sub-stages. The younger pseudotachylytes were generated along two sets of generation planes: one set parallel to the trend of the Canavese Line, the other one perpendicular to it. Formation of pseudotachylytes is followed by cataclasis events stages which are best preserved in the Balmuccia peridotite body exposed along the Sesia river...|$|R
500|$|Tesla's {{demonstration}} of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, {{came at the}} time of extreme competition between electric companies. The three big firms, Westinghouse, Edison, and Thompson-Houston, were trying to grow in a capital intensive business while financially undercutting each other. There was even a [...] "War of Currents" [...] propaganda campaign going on with Edison Electric trying to claim their direct current system was better and safer than the Westinghouse alternating current system. Competing in this market meant Westinghouse would not have the cash or engineering resources to develop Tesla's motor and the related <b>polyphase</b> system right away.|$|E
500|$|Two {{years after}} signing the Tesla contract, Westinghouse Electric was in trouble. The near {{collapse}} of Barings Bank in London triggered the financial panic of 1890, causing investors {{to call in}} their loans to W.E. The sudden cash shortage forced the company to refinance its debts. The new lenders demanded that Westinghouse cut back on what looked like excessive spending on acquisition of other companies, research, and patents, including the per motor royalty in the Tesla contract. At that point, the Tesla induction motor had been unsuccessful and was stuck in development. Westinghouse was paying a $15,000 a year guaranteed royalty even though operating examples of the motor were rare and <b>polyphase</b> power systems needed to run it were even rarer. In early 1891, George Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that, {{if he did not}} meet the demands of his lenders, he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to [...] "deal with the bankers" [...] to try to collect future royalties. The advantages of having Westinghouse continue to champion the motor probably seemed obvious to Tesla and he agreed to release the company from the royalty payment clause in the contract. Six years later Westinghouse would purchase Tesla's patent for a lump sum payment of $216,000 as part of a patent sharing agreement signed with General Electric (a company created from the 1892 merger of Edison, and Thompson-Houston).|$|E

40|$|International audienceFrom field {{observations}} {{in the lower}} Kert valley and 16 radiocarbon dating measurements, six alluvial units (UF 1 to UF 6) deposited since about 30, 000 years BP have been identified, comprising 18 lithofacies and separated by six incision stages resulting in three alluvial terraces (T 1 to T 3). While the Late Pleistocene is mainly marked by sedimentary accretion (UF 1 forming part of T 1), the Holocene is marked by the alternation of major incision (I 2, I 3 and I 4) and accretion (UF 2 and UF 3) stages, with roughly similar height ranges, between the current river level and <b>polyphased</b> T 1 surface. During the Lower and Middle Holocene, this complex morphosedimentary evolution {{could have been the}} result of contrasted bioclimatic trends that did not appear during the Late Pleistocene. Human activities modified the earth surface conditions, intermittently during the Middle Holocene, and during the Upper Holocene, inducing new responses from the fluvial geosystem to the environment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} {{new evidence}} of Quaternary faulting observable in large outcrop exposures (trenches and carries) near Romilly-sur-Seine in {{the centre of}} Paris basin. Coeval normal or reverse faults affect sand, marl and gravel units that also expose liquefaction features. Quaternary units with thicknesses ranging from decimetre to metre are sealed by non-deformed deposits. The coexistence of soft and brittle tectonics with ~ 1 m vertical offset in a single cross-section, affecting different stratigraphic levels, reflects their diachronic nature and attest for their coseismic origin. The faulting of young deposits visible in the paleoseismic sites belong to the major regional tectonic structures, i. e. the Omey and Vittel fault system that affects the late Quaternary units of the east Paris basin. Their activity known locally as Ypresian <b>polyphased</b> seismites, seems to have continued until the late Quaternary. The Quaternary ruptures and coseismic nature of the fault system call for a realistic seismic hazard assessment in this intraplate tectonic environment...|$|R
40|$|Extended {{abstract}} (5 pages) In {{order to}} better understand the relationships between ore deposit distribution and their tectonic context, and help identifying geodynamic-related criteria of favorability, we propose a paleogeographic approach. We use this approach to study the distribution of porphyry copper deposits along the western Tethyan suture. Spatial and temporal distribution of the deposits is not random and show that they were emplaced in five distinct clusters. Two clusters, in the Aegean-Balkan-Carpathian area, that were emplaced in Upper Cretaceous and Oligo-Miocene, are associated with a specific <b>polyphased</b> kinematic context, {{within the framework of the}} Africa-Eurasia convergence. This context is characterized by 1) a fast subduction rate, shortly followed by 2) a drastic decrease of this rate. Although preliminary, these results highlight the control of the geodynamic context, and especially the subduction kinematics, on the genesis of porphyry deposits. This study also confirms that the paleogeographic approach is a promising tool that could help identifying geodynamic and tectonic criteria favoring the genesis of various ore deposit types...|$|R
