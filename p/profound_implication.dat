5000|$|Nicolaisen {{was active}} in linking {{geography}} {{to the study of}} folklore and language, {{and was one of the}} founders of the Society for North American Cultural Survey to promote work in the field. Nicolaisen was an advocate for mapping folk culture in America as an applied form of folklore study so as to visualize the ways that people [...] "make regions." [...] Nicolaisen insisted that the geographic approach has a <b>profound</b> <b>implication</b> for folklore studies. This approach suggests folk culture as a whole with registers, isoglosses, and dialects. His goal, he stated in essays such as [...] "Variant, Dialect, and Region" [...] for the journal New York Folklore with which he was associated for many years, was of achieving a geography of tradition that could lead to a geography of the human mind.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{first used}} in Chicago, the {{steel-framed}} skyscraper caught on most quickly in New York City in the 1880s, {{and from there}} spread to most other American cities in the 1890s and 1900s. The apparent lack of a height limitation {{of this type of}} building set off a fervent debate over whether their height should be restricted by law, with proponents and opponents of height limits bringing out numerous arguments in favor of their position. The question of height limits also had a <b>profound</b> <b>implication</b> for the nature of downtown itself: would it continue to be a concentrated core, or as it grew, would height limits force it to spread out into a larger area. [...] In the short run, the proponents of height limits were successful in their efforts. By the 1910s, most of the largest and medium-sized cities had height limits in effect, with New York [...] - [...] despite several concerted efforts to enact them, Philadelphia, Detroit, Pittsburgh and Minneapolis being notable holdouts.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the book}} The Big Picture, atheist {{physicist}} Sean Carroll explains how he believes physics shows death {{is equivalent to}} eternal oblivion. He writes, [...] "There {{is a much more}} <b>profound</b> <b>implication</b> of accepting the Core Theory as underlying the world of our everyday experience. Namely: there is no life after death. We each have a finite time as living creatures, and when it’s over, it’s over. The reasoning behind such a sweeping claim is even more straightforward than the argument against telekinesis or astrology. If the particles and forces of the Core Theory are what constitute each living being, without any immaterial soul, then the information that makes up “you” is contained in the arrangement of atoms that makes up your body, including your brain. There is no place for that information to go, or any way for it to be preserved, outside your body. There are no particles or fields that could store it and take it away." ...|$|E

5000|$|This is a {{landmark}} case in Ireland, with the <b>profound</b> <b>implication</b> {{as stated by}} Osborough (1976): [...] "The immunity of the State in tort had been given its quietus" [...] and {{the concerns of the}} judge in the High Court about the risks of Ministers and their servants being held liable for errors indicates how significant the subsequent ruling in the Supreme Court was. Judicial acts would seem to be protected with immunity by common law rules and the Constitution. The judgement in Byrne v Ireland and the Attorney General also reinforced and extended the existing tortious liability of the State relating to road accidents caused by agents of the State in publicly owned vehicles in the Civil Liability Act (1961). The historical context of the landmark decision is captured in Binchy's (2016) characterisation of it as marking the emerging nature of the Irish state as a servant of its people rather than a repository of sovereign rights and immunity inherent in the Crown.|$|E
5000|$|The channel {{expansion}} {{theory can}} be applied for organizational communication. Early conceptualization of organizational media use focused on media characteristics as primary determinants of users’ communication experience: social presence theorists argued that users' experience interacting via a particular channel depends on how co-present medium allows communicators to feel. Media richness theorists focused on the objective dimensions of media richness {{and the need to}} match the degree of medium richness with the message equivocality for effective communication. [...] Channel expansion theory moves away from objective conceptualization of media and suggests that user’s perceptions of media richness are dependent on users prior experience with the channel. In this sense, the more knowledge-building experiences users acquires with a given channel (context, partner, and topic) the richer will be their perceptions of the medium and the more likely they will be to use it effectively. For organizational managers, the theory demonstrates that communication effectiveness and choice of communication media is bounded by user’s communication experiences, thus in order for the organizational employees to become proficient on a given communication channel and in a given organizational context, they must go through learning process to maximize the media communication richness potential. Additionally, the theory is associated with the level of the communicator’s ability to appropriate the medium to achieve shared understanding with communication partner; as perception of media richness improves with the acquired experience it has a positive effect on use richness - how much users employ various features of a communication channel. As individual users vary in how they utilize different features of media channels in their communication processes there is also a need for some form of training to continuously support users as technical features and communication capabilities of the channel expand (channel becomes richer). The most <b>profound</b> <b>implication</b> the theory has for individual media users is that it places great emphasis upon building knowledge rather than just simple experiences with media channels; if users wish to enhance effectiveness of a media tool they should acquire knowledge about its characteristics and capabilities rather than just use it repeatedly.|$|E

40|$|On-body {{radio channel}} {{modeling}} and measurement {{has been studied}} extensively. However, the spatial correlation properties of channel parameters and the reliability of on-body channel measurements remain poorly understood. In this letter, a K-weight-based spatial autocorrelation model and corresponding Z-score is used to investigate the spatial correlation of on-body radio propagation {{and the degree of}} confidence in measurement results. It is demonstrated that, due to rich multipath scattering in an indoor environment, both the spatial autocorrelation and corresponding confidence level are higher compared to those in the chamber environment. These findings have the <b>profound</b> <b>implication</b> that, for less scattered environments, the locations of transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) need to be very accurate in order to achieve high repeatability in on-body channel measurements...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Very {{little work}} has been done on specifying a {{standard}} mapping between the overlapping semantic specifications in the standardized data models used in architecture, engineering and construction (A/E/C, e. g., IAI-IFC and ISO-STEP standards). However, several companies have developed bespoke mappings from these standards into their design tools, and back out again. With this approach it is difficult to understand how complete their mappings are, and what assumptions are made {{in the development of the}} mappings. Yet for semantic mappings, as distinct from mappings over geometric representations, this has a <b>profound</b> <b>implication</b> for the correctness of the resultant data. In this paper the development of a suite of mapping support tools is discussed to illustrate the level of support required to ensure semantically correct mappings across data models. ...|$|E
