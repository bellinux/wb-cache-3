40|$|We report {{results from}} an {{experiment}} on ranking visual markers and node positioning techniques for network visualizations. Inspired by prior ranking studies, we rethink the ranking when the dataset size increases {{and when the}} markers are distributed in space. Centrality indices are visualized as node attributes. Our experiment studies nine visual markers and three positioning methods. Our results suggest that direct encoding of quantities improves accuracy by about 20 % compared to previous results. Of the three positioning techniques, circular {{was always in the}} top group, and matrix and <b>projection</b> <b>switch</b> orders depending on two factors: whether or not the tasks demand symmetry, or the nodes are within closely proximity. Among the most interesting results of ranking the visual markers for comparison tasks are that hue and area fall into the top groups for nearly all multi-scale comparison tasks; Shape (ordered by curvature) is perhaps not as scalable as we have thought and can support more accurate answers only when two quantities are compared; Lightness and slope are least accurate for quantitative comparisons regardless of scale of the comparison tasks. Our experiment is among the first to acquire a complete picture of ranking visual markers in different scales for comparison tasks...|$|E
40|$|Rett {{syndrome}} (RTT) is a neuro-developmental disorder {{caused by}} {{loss of function}} of Mecp 2 - methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 - an epigenetic factor controlling DNA transcription. In mice, removal of Mecp 2 in the forebrain recapitulates most of behavioral deficits found in global Mecp 2 deficient mice, including amygdala-related hyper-anxiety and lack of social interaction, pointing a role of Mecp 2 in emotional learning. Yet very {{little is known about}} the establishment and maintenance of synaptic function in the adult amygdala and the role of Mecp 2 in these processes. Here, we performed a longitudinal examination of synaptic properties at excitatory projections to principal cells of the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) in Mecp 2 mutant mice and their wild-type littermates. We first show that during animal life, Cortico-LA <b>projections</b> <b>switch</b> from a tonic to a phasic mode, whereas Thalamo-LA synapses are phasic at all ages. In parallel, we observed a specific elimination of Cortico-LA synapses and a decrease in their ability of generating presynaptic long term potentiation. In absence of Mecp 2, both synaptic maturation and synaptic elimination were exaggerated albeit still specific to cortical projections. Surprisingly, associative LTP was unaffected at Mecp 2 deficient synapses suggesting that synaptic maintenance rather than activity-dependent synaptic learning may be causal in RTT physiopathology. Finally, because the timing of synaptic evolution was preserved, we propose that some of the developmental effects of Mecp 2 may be exerte...|$|R

40|$|A {{widely used}} method in {{high-speed}} 3 D shape measurement, color-code fringe projection requires {{the projection of}} only one image. In traditional color-code method, the projected fringe is compounded by sinusoidal fringes, grayscale value distribution ranges from 0 – 255, and projection speed is limited to 120 frames/s. Consequently, measurement speed is restricted, and a nonlinear gamma of the projector exists, as well as high harmonics, which have a great influence on measurement accuracy. Binary color-code fringe defocused projection is proposed to solve the abovementioned problems. With the proposed method, <b>projection</b> speed can <b>switch</b> to tens of K frames/s because it only has two grayscale values (0 and 255). A standard sinusoidal color-code fringe can be generated by properly defocusing the binary color-code fringe, thereby overcoming the influence of nonlinear gamma and ultimately improving measurement accuracy. Experiment results verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method...|$|R

Vancouver's first video/photography-based {{permanent}} public art installation.Flow, produced by Bowie with Sidney Fels, a UBC Computer Scientist, was commissioned by the City of Vancouver. Rebecca Belmore, initially part of the artist team, could {{not participate in the}} project due to time constraints. This was the first permanent installation of timebased photo and media work in the City of Vancouver. Flow is a continually changing Mise en scène that uses open source software to access a library of images shot by Bowie over a period of four years.

40|$|Micromirrors are {{a typical}} example of Micro-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) with many {{applications}} including optical scanners, optical <b>switching,</b> <b>projection</b> displays, etc. We {{have succeeded in}} producing MEMS micromirrors in a SiGe structural layer, {{which can be used}} to realize CMOS-integrated MEMS structures. Several pixel designs were simulated using COMSOL multiphysics and subsequently verified in hardware. They differ in mirror size, hinge length and number of attracting electrodes (two or four). One particular mirror design enables variable Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) addressing. In this design, the mirror switches between two extreme states with a variable duty cycle determined by two generic high voltage signals and two CMOS-compatible pixel-specific DC voltages applied to the four attracting electrodes. The processed arrays were subjected to Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) measurements in order to verify the simulation results. The simulated and measured pull-in voltages are compared for 8, 10 and 15 µm mirrors. The agreement between simulation and measurement lies within the expectations, which is an encouraging result for future designs...|$|R
40|$|The {{realization}} of multiple phases flow visualization using capacitance sensors together with process tomography technique has shown improvements in process control {{as well as}} the process output. In this book, the study has concentrated on the design and experimental implementation of optical sensors as an alternative solution to the visualization of solid/gas flow system. The design has employed 16 LEDs to generate fan beam projection and 16 PIN photodiodes to retrieve the imformation from each <b>projection.</b> A <b>switch</b> mode <b>projection</b> controller is designed to control the projection and interrogate the maximum number of measurements from optical sensors. This configuration utilized the divergent–beam interrogation where a larger angle of divergence provides better measurements. The transient respsonse of sensor is investigated to maximize the data acquisition rate. As a result, the maximum data acquisition rate achieved was 529 fps where each frame consisted of 256 measurements. Modeling of projection area based on sensors geometry position and covering direction is carried out to produce the sensitivity map for each pair of sensors. Then, the sensors output modeling is performed to predict the projection area modeling. A new type of back projection algorithm named graphical back projection (GBP) has been developed based on a retrieved computer graphic memory principle to produce a higher performance of image reconstruction. The comparison of image reconstruction algorithms has shown that result produced by GBP is similar to the Linear Back Projection in terms of quality but 2. 1 times faster in resolution 32 × 32 and 13. 3 times faster in resolution 128 × 128 in terms of performance. Experimental results obtained off–line using idealized flow models and on–line using a solid particles flow demonstrate the performance of the system and highlight areas where further development is needed...|$|R
40|$|Stereoscopic {{multi-user}} systems provide multiple {{users with}} individual {{views of a}} virtual environment. We developed a new projection-based stereoscopic display for six users, which employs six customized DLP projectors for fast time-sequential image display in combination with polarization. Our intelligent high-speed shutter glasses can be programmed from the application {{to adapt to the}} situation. For instance, it does this by staying open if users do not look at the <b>projection</b> screen or <b>switch</b> to a VIP high brightness mode if less than six users use the system. Each user is tracked and can move freely in front of the display while perceiving perspectively correct views of the virtual environment. Navigating a group of six users through a virtual world leads to situations in which the group will not fit through spatial constrictions. Our augmented group navigation techniques ameliorate this situation by fading out obstacles or by slightly redirecting individual users al ong a collision-free path. While redirection goes mostly unnoticed, both techniques temporarily give up the notion of a consistent shared space. Our user study confirms that users generally prefer this trade-off over naïve approaches...|$|R
40|$|Animals live {{in highly}} complex sensory environments that are repres- ented across {{multiple}} sensory-modalities. These multi-sensory neural representations allow animals to successfully navigate {{in space and}} to form relevant associative memories critical to survival. The remembered location of a plentiful food source or a predator could {{mean the difference between}} life and death. To form survival relevant associative memories across multiple sensory modalities animals must be able to sense, encode, and integrate information from their immediate environment. The Information gathered across multiple sensory systems must therefore be temporally correlated and converge within the brain. The mammalian hippocampus is one such structure where sensory information converges. Hippocampal place cells are known to fire at a particular location within an animal’s environment (place field). As the animal moves through a place field action potentials proceed in phase with respect to hippocampal theta oscillations (phase precession). Place fields encode specific positions in the animal’s environment, and therefore provide a suitable substrate for the integration of diverse sensory inputs with spatial information. Such association would position sensory landmarks within the environment and would thus be crucial for successful spatial orientation and navigation. To better understand how multisensory information is integrated for the formation of a neuronal place map, I performed in-vivo extracellular recordings in the hippocampus of behaving Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). Specifically, I sought to understand the relative contribution of visual and locomotor inputs to place cell activity. Recordings were performed in a virtual reality behavioural setup in which animals ran along a virtual linear corridor. Animal locomotion was determined via a tracking-ball treadmill. By altering the gain factor between the movement of the ball and the speed of the visual projection on a single trial basis I could decouple visually perceived movement from the animal’s locomotion. Through these experiments I showed that place cells in Cornu Ammonis area 3 (CA 3) responded differentially to closed loop manipulation. One subset of place cells formed its place field based on visual information within the virtual environment, independent of the distance travelled by the animal. Such visually driven place fields predominantly occurred at visual texture changes within the virtual corridor. A second subset of place cells relied predominantly on locomotor inputs, as place fields remained at the same running distance on a single trial basis. This was also confirmed in dark trials during which the <b>projection</b> was <b>switched</b> off. This meant that animals had to rely on internal cues such as path-integration and proprioceptive/motor efference information. A third subset of cells exhibited two place fields, with each field being driven by one of the two different inputs. As a population both types of place fields formed input-specific maps that were simultaneously represented in the hippocampus. This notion is corroborated by the fact that place field firing was adjusted on a single trial basis without adaptive processes required. Furthermore, I investigated whether overlapping input-specific place maps are integrated in a common processing frame. To this end I analysed phase precession of overlapping place fields, which is thought to be crucial for encoding time ordered events that are compressed within a theta cycle. I found that theta-scale timing correlations shift with gain changes, which argues against mechanisms based exclusively on recurrent CA 3 connections for memory formation. My results therefore indicate that the hippocampus preserves information from distinct processing streams to form coexisting space representations. These coexisting input-specific maps could then be associated on a population level in order to form multimodal memories. Such association is likely to be formed from sensory information, fed-forward via the hippocampus, rather than via recurrent hippocampal connections. Thus, the hippocampus provides animals with several maps of their environment, each specified for a specific sensory-input. Animals could therefore rely on the most appropriate map such that locomotor information would be more precise than visual information when the animal is navigating in darkness...|$|R
