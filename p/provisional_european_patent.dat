50|$|Europe {{does not}} {{comprise}} a unitary <b>patent</b> system. <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> law is instead {{characterized by the}} coexistence of national patent systems, and thus national patent offices, and a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> system associated with the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention (EPC), {{in the context of}} which the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office (EPO) grants <b>European</b> <b>patents</b> through a central prosecution procedure. Enforcement of <b>European</b> <b>patents</b> are conducted and decided at a national level, i.e. before national courts. The patent offices in Europe therefore include, on the one hand, the plurality of national patent offices and, on the other hand, the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office. See also <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> law.|$|R
5000|$|<b>European</b> <b>patents</b> {{are granted}} by the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office (EPO) under the legal {{provisions}} of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention (EPC). However, <b>European</b> <b>patents</b> are enforced at a national level, i.e. on a per-country basis. Under , [...] "any infringement of a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> shall {{be dealt with by}} national law," [...] with the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office having no legal competence to deal with and to decide on patent infringements in the Contracting States to the EPC. A few, limited aspects relating to the infringement of <b>European</b> <b>patents</b> are however prescribed in the EPC.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Register, {{also known}} as the Register of <b>European</b> <b>Patents,</b> is a public {{register}} kept by the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office (EPO). It contains legal information relating to published <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> applications and <b>European</b> <b>patents</b> granted under the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention (EPC). The register notably provides the current legal status of <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> applications and patents, such as for instance [...] "whether a patent application has been published, whether a patent has been granted, what the outcome of opposition proceedings was or whether a patent has been revoked".|$|R
50|$|Within the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office, {{examiners}} are {{in charge}} of studying <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> applications, filed by applicants, in order to decide whether to grant a patent for an invention.

50|$|The {{task of the}} <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office (EPO), {{which is}} the main organ of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Organisation, is to grant <b>European</b> <b>patents</b> (and also to hear and {{determine}} third-party challenges to the validity of <b>European</b> <b>patents,</b> in opposition proceedings). The EPO exists by virtue of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention (EPC), and is not legally bound to the European Union.|$|R
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office (EPO) is {{in charge}} of {{granting}} <b>European</b> <b>patents.</b> The grant procedure before the EPO is administrative procedure, which notably involves a substantive examination of the <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> application, in accordance with the legal provisions of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention (EPC).|$|R
50|$|In {{the context}} of the {{proceedings}} at the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office (EPO), third parties may dispute the validity of a granted <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> by filing a post-grant opposition under the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention (EPC). The term for filing an opposition with the EPO is nine months from the publication of the mention of the grant of the <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> in the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Bulletin.|$|R
5000|$|The EPO offers on its {{web site}} several free services, {{including}} Espacenet and Open Patent Services (OPS) for searching within its collection of patent documents, the legal texts published in its Official Journal, the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Register containing legal information relating to published <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> applications and <b>European</b> <b>patents</b> (the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Register also allowing the inspection of files under [...] ), and a publication server of the <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> applications and patents.

5000|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office {{does not}} make {{decisions}} on infringement matters.

In other words, a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> in one Contracting State, i.e. a [...] "national" [...] <b>European</b> <b>patent,</b> is effectively independent of the same <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> in each other Contracting State, except for the opposition, limitation and revocation procedures.

50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention (EPC), {{also known}} as the Convention on the Grant of <b>European</b> <b>Patents</b> of 5 October 1973, is a {{multilateral}} treaty instituting the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Organisation and providing an autonomous legal system according to which <b>European</b> <b>patents</b> are granted. The term <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> is used to refer to patents granted under the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention. However, a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> is not a unitary right, but a group of essentially independent nationally-enforceable, nationally-revocable patents, subject to central revocation or narrowing as a group pursuant to two types of unified, post-grant procedures: a time-limited opposition procedure, which can be initiated by any person except the patent proprietor, and limitation and revocation procedures, which can be initiated by the patent proprietor only.|$|R
5000|$|Since 1978 and {{the entry}} into force of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention, the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office also issues patents {{effective}} in Germany, {{as part of a}} <b>European</b> <b>patent's</b> [...] "bundle" [...] of national patents.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the unified, regional character of a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> application, the granted <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> does not comprise, in effect, any such unitary character, except for the opposition procedure. In other words, one <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> in one Contracting State is effectively independent of the same <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> in each other Contracting State, except for the opposition procedure.|$|R

40|$|This master thesis {{deals with}} the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> System. The aim of this thesis is to provide the reader with a complex review of the Patent Law at the {{european}} level from its early beginning, when in the 70 's was signed the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention at the Munich Diplomatic Conference, up to the present. The thesis is systematically divided into five chapters and each chapter also contains several subchapters. The first chapter is dedicated to historical development of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent.</b> In the second chapter there is {{a brief description of}} the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention and its two most important revisions. The third, most extensive chapter is dedicated to the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Organisation which was founded in 1977 on the legal basis of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention. I deal especially with its two fundamental bodies - the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office and the Administrative Council. There is also a definition of the term of patentability as it is regulated by <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention and a characteristic of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Application. A separate subsection of the third section focuses on the patent granting procedure in front of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office.

5000|$|The {{official}} {{languages of}} the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office are English, French and German and publications including the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Bulletin and Official Journal of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office are published {{in all three}} of those languages.|$|R
50|$|A <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> is {{the product}} of a unified grant {{procedure}} before the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office (EPO) under procedures established by the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention (EPC). A <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> is a regional, non-unitary patent. Some of the 38 EPC Contracting States require the patentee to file a full translation of the granted <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> with the national patent office of the State if the text of the <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> as granted is not in one of their official languages. If the required translation is not filed, the <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> is deemed to have no effect from the outset in that State. The London Agreement, which entered into force on May 1, 2008, significantly reduces the number of required translations in the 20 states that are party to it.|$|R
5000|$|Article 83 of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention (EPC) {{relates to}} the {{disclosure}} of the invention under the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention. This legal provision prescribes that a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> application must disclose the invention (which {{is the subject of}} the <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> application) in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art.|$|R
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention (EPC), the {{multilateral}} treaty instituting {{the legal system}} according to which <b>European</b> <b>patents</b> are granted, contains provisions allowing a party to appeal a decision issued by a first instance department of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office (EPO). For instance, a decision of an Examining Division refusing to grant a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> application may be appealed by the applicant. The appeal procedure before the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office is under the responsibility of its Boards of Appeal, which are institutionally independent within the EPO.|$|R
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office is {{directed}} by a president, {{who is responsible for}} its activities to the Administrative Council. The president also represents the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Organisation. The president has therefore a dual role: representative of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Organisation and head of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office. The President of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office is appointed by the Administrative Council. A majority of three-quarters of the votes of the Contracting States represented and voting in the Administrative Council is required for the appointment of the President.|$|R
40|$|Note: Within {{nine months}} from the {{publication}} of the mention of the grant of the <b>European</b> <b>patent,</b> any person may give notice to the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office of opposition to the <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> granted.

50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Organisation (sometimes {{abbreviated}} EPOrg {{in order}} to distinguish it from the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office, {{one of the two}} organs of the organisation) is a public international organisation created in 1977 by its contracting states to grant patents in Europe under the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention (EPC) of 1973. The <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Organisation has its seat at Munich, Germany, and has administrative and financial autonomy.|$|R
50|$|In <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> law, the {{limitation}} and revocation procedures before the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office (EPO) are post-grant, ex parte, administrative procedures allowing any <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> to be centrally limited by an amendment {{of the claims}} or revoked, respectively. These two procedures were introduced in the recently revised text of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention (EPC), i.e. the so-called EPC 2000, which entered into force on 13 December 2007.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> {{application}} {{with the}} aim [...] "to protect an assembly of pad holder and pad", i.e. the Senseo coffee pods, was filed on September 30, 1998 by the Dutch firm [...] "Sara Lee/DE N.V." [...] The <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office granted [...] on July 11, 2001. The <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> took force {{in a number of}} Contracting States of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention, including Belgium.|$|R
50|$|The {{existing}} competences of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office remain unchanged: A so-called {{opposition procedure}} {{dealing with the}} validity of the patent (but not with infringement) may also be brought before the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office during a 9-month period after the grant of the patent. Decisions by the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office are valid throughout the territory where the <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> is valid and may thus encompass 38 countries. Furthermore, countries may still grant their own national patents independently of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office. Such patents are not litigated in the Unified Patent Court.|$|R
2500|$|Under the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention, [...] "chemes, {{rules and}} methods for (...) doing business" [...] are not {{regarded}} as inventions {{and are not}} patentable, [...] "to the extent that a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> application or <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> relates to such subject-matter or activities as such".|$|R
50|$|The EPC 2000 or <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention 2000 is {{the version}} of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention (EPC) as revised by the Act Revising the Convention on the Grant of <b>European</b> <b>Patents</b> signed in Munich on November 29, 2000. On June 28, 2001, the Administrative Council of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Organisation adopted the final new text of the EPC 2000. The EPC 2000 entered into force on December 13, 2007.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{revised version}} of the Convention shall apply to all <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> {{applications}} filed after its entry into force, {{as well as to}} all patents granted in respect of such applications. It shall not apply to <b>European</b> <b>patents</b> already granted {{at the time of its}} entry into force, or to <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> applications pending at that time, unless otherwise decided by the Administrative Council of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Organisation." ...|$|R
5000|$|Under the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention (EPC), any {{third party}} -i.e., {{essentially}} any person- may file {{observations on the}} patentability of an invention which {{is the subject of}} a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> application or, after grant, subject of a <b>European</b> <b>patent,</b> especially to draw the attention of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office (EPO) to some relevant prior art documents. This is a form of public participation in the examination of patent applications.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to examine <b>European</b> <b>patent.</b> The work deals with the {{historical}} development of the <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> from its beginning to the current system. Subsequently, the work focuses on analysis of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Organization established with the adoption of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Convention in 1977. The functioning of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office and the Administration Council, including a summary of the sources for the decisions of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office is captured in the second part. The third chapter focuses on the question of patentability, the process of filing a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> application and its effects in the Czech Republic. The fourth chapter deals with the emergence of the Agreement on the Unified Patent Court and its critics. The main emphasis is placed on the description of the future operation of the Unified Patent Court and the issues that arise around it...|$|R
