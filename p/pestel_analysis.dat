The article compares the process of phasing out coal power generation in both countries. A <b>PESTEL</b> <b>analysis</b> technique is used to capture the external context of the coal phase out in both countries. This technique allows the identification of the drivers and barriers of the coal phase out, taking into account the differences between the two contexts. Important contrasts and lessons arise out of this comparative discussion of Britain and Germany. This comparison leads to an analysis of the risks and opportunities for the coal phase out in both countries and enables the transferability of the analysis to other countries that may face a decision to phase out coal. For instance, several central and eastern European nations are still reliant on coal in power generation, but may need to reconsider energy policy in view of their climate obligations. The evaluation of factors identified in the <b>PESTEL</b> <b>analysis</b> phase helps the formulation of suggestions for policymakers in relation to the management of the coal phase out...|$|E
