5000|$|SideShow gadgets - run on {{auxiliary}} external displays, such as on {{the outside}} of a laptop or even on an LCD <b>panel</b> in a <b>keyboard,</b> and potentially mobile phones and other devices.|$|R
50|$|For guiding {{operators}} and making round identification and fuzing, the Operator's Panel (OP) includes an LCD display with fixed instructions and one dot matrix line The Loader <b>Keyboard</b> <b>Panel</b> (LKP) includes breech block closing switch, fire and local {{activation of the}} trays.|$|R
5000|$|The laptop (or notebook) {{with a flat}} <b>panel</b> {{display and}} <b>keyboard,</b> {{requiring}} a seated position and both hands. A relatively recently introduced modification has been the tablet PC, which has a monitor with a touch-sensitive screen. See also desktop replacement computer, a large laptop designed to perform all of the functions of a desktop computer.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Moog Music {{released}} the Voyager Rack Mount Edition (RME), a synthesizer {{based on the}} Voyager. The RME was designed to occupy 5 spaces in a 19-inch rack. The model has all {{of the features of}} other Voyagers except the touch <b>panel</b> control and <b>keyboard.</b> The RME is designed to be controlled via MIDI. Up to 16 RME Voyagers can be combined to achieve polyphony.|$|R
50|$|The Gavilan sported an LCD display with {{an unusual}} {{resolution}} of 400×64 pixels. It included a pioneering touchpad-like pointing device, installed on a <b>panel</b> above the <b>keyboard.</b> It used static CMOS memory, and came with 64 kilobytes standard. Memory was expandable through plug-in modules, for which there were four slots available (each 32 kb module cost $350 and included a backup battery); these {{could also be used}} for software ROM cartridges.|$|R
5000|$|The LINC {{and other}} [...] "MIT Group" [...] {{machines}} were designed at MIT and eventually built by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and Spear Inc. of Waltham, Massachusetts (later {{a division of}} Becton, Dickinson and Company). The LINC sold for more than $40,000 at the time. A typical configuration included an enclosed 6'X20" [...] rack, four boxes holding tape drives, a small display, a control <b>panel,</b> and a <b>keyboard.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although the oscillators, {{filters and}} {{amplifiers}} themselves are voltage controlled, the overall {{control of the}} synthesizer channels is entirely in software. The embedded computer generates thirty-two Attack Decay Release envelopes (two per channel, one with delay) and sixteen Low Frequency Oscillator sweep signals in software. Signals from the levers, pedals, control <b>panel</b> or the <b>keyboard</b> are all encoded digitally, processed by the computer, {{and sent to the}} synthesizer channels on the voice cards via several multiplexed analog control lines and a number of digital control registers.|$|R
50|$|The Stylophone is a {{miniature}} analog stylus-operated keyboard. Invented in 1967 by Brian Jarvis, it entered production in 1968, manufactured by Dubreq. It {{consists of a}} metal keyboard played by touching it with a stylus—each note being connected to a voltage-controlled oscillator via a different-value resistor—thus closing a circuit. The only other controls were a power switch and a vibrato control on the front <b>panel</b> beside the <b>keyboard,</b> and a tuning control on the rear. Some three million Stylophones were sold, mostly as children's toys.|$|R
50|$|Krusader's user {{interface}} {{is based on}} the orthodox file manager (OFM) principle, also known as Commander-like file managers, the family of file managers based on the old Norton Commander interface. The orthodox file manager has two windows called panels where one is active and the other inactive. The idea is to manipulate files from active to inactive panel or within the active <b>panel.</b> Only the <b>keyboard</b> is required to do this, which makes the process much faster. Using the mouse is still an option. Krusader's deep integration into KDE (e.g. KParts, KIO) allows it to provide several additional services.|$|R
5000|$|Two other {{noteworthy}} early laptops {{were the}} Sharp PC-5000 and the Gavilan SC, announced in 1983 but first sold in 1984. The Gavilan was notably the first computer to be marketed as a [...] "laptop". It was also {{equipped with a}} pioneering touchpad-like pointing device, installed on a <b>panel</b> above the <b>keyboard.</b> Like the GRiD Compass, the Gavilan and the Sharp were housed in clamshell cases, but they were partly IBM-compatible, although primarily running their own system software. Both had LCDs, and could connect to optional external printers. The Dulmont Magnum, launched internationally in 1984, was an Australian portable similar in layout to the Gavilan, which used the Intel 80186 processor.|$|R
40|$|In {{the work}} {{discusses}} computational {{capabilities of the}} microcontroller STM 23 F 429 ZIT 6. It is installed on the board STM 32 F 429 I-DISCO. The microcontroller has a 2 MB Flash memory, 256 Kbytes of RAM and runs at a frequency of 180 MHz. The board STM 32 F 429 I-DISCO installed SDRAM memory of 64 Mbps. In the paper compared the time of calculation of matrix multiplication for the microcontroller and the PC with a processor AMD Phenom II X 6 1090 T(3, 2 GHz). It uses one core. Entering initial data performed with the touch <b>panel</b> display. The <b>keyboard</b> is programmatically created and displayed {{at the bottom of}} the display...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{hardware}} interfaces {{designed specifically for}} gaming and while sometimes used with less powerful PCs, they are most often observed with gaming PCs. Such interfaces include keyboards and mice built for gaming (these typically include additional keys or buttons for game-related functions as well as LCD-screens, higher sensitivity (mouse), better aderency (keyboard/mouse) and less/more friction depending on the user's needs), joysticks, gamepads, steering wheels, PC-compatible airplane gauges and <b>panels,</b> etc. A <b>keyboard</b> and mouse is the preferred method for most games, giving the best speed and accuracy. It {{should be noted that}} touch screens are rarely used for PC gaming at this point. [...] "Haptic feedback" [...] commonly known as force feedback, allows for greater immersion into the games played. While there are no keyboards that support haptic feedback, some mice and most forms of game controllers do.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 50 - 51) This paper {{investigates the}} feasibility {{and effectiveness of}} modifying an existing manual test station to include a microcomputer. The microprocessor is used as the computer controller in this application. The primary use of the controller {{is to improve the}} testing capability of the test station to allow faster more efficient testing. The test station has hard-wired test programs and commercial instruments used to functional test, fault isolate and align a radar system. A brief description of the test requirements and the manual test concept provide a basis to outline the design goals for the microcontroller. The controller design and the trade-off information in Chapter 3 describe the hardware to implement the semiautomatic test concept. The design consists of: microcomputer, cassette tape unit, <b>panel</b> display input <b>keyboard</b> and station interface. The software development task is emphasized as the major task in this application and efficient methods {{for the development of the}} test programs is suggested. System programs to supervise the overall testing and respond to operator commands are outlined. These programs allow limited flexibility and intervention by the operator and are designed to expedite the testing task. The microprocessor is suggested in this limited automation task as an economical control device...|$|R
