5|$|Matt Bissonnette, a SEAL {{who participated}} in the raid, wrote an account of the mission in the book No Easy Day (2012), which {{significantly}} contradicts Pfarrer's account. Bissonnette wrote that the helicopter approach and landing matched the official version. According to Bissonnette, when bin Laden <b>peered</b> <b>out</b> at the Americans advancing on his third-floor room, the SEAL who fired upon him hit him {{on the right side of}} the head. Bin Laden stumbled into his bedroom, where the SEALs found him crumpled and twitching on the floor in a pool of body matter, with two women crying over his body. The other SEALs allegedly grabbed the women, moved them away, and shot bin Laden repeatedly in the chest until he was dead. According to Bissonnette, the weapons in the room—an AK-47 rifle and a Makarov pistol—were unloaded.|$|E
25|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, and when food is locally abundant, the ducks may congregate in small flocks, sometimes {{of up to}} about a hundred. Murphy noted:On December 20th, 1912, I photographed a pair of teals feeding in a trickle of water which ran through tall tussock grass from the melting edge of a glacier. The birds were well hidden by the screen of grass, and I almost stumbled over them before seeing them. They appeared quite unconcerned, however, and continued prodding about in the mud. When I had come within two steps of them, they raised their heads and waddled farther off among the hummocks, from where they <b>peered</b> <b>out</b> through drooping grass. All but the bright eyes and yellow bills blended completely with the surroundings. Matthews has well said that their pattern fits in so thoroughly with the environment that it is sometimes only {{the movement of the}} conspicuous yellow bill that calls one’s attention to their presence. Many observers have noted the birds’ preference to lose themselves in the grass when they are approached, rather than to seek safety in the air, and it is likely that before the arrival of men and guns at South Georgia they used their wings only for relatively short and infrequent flights.|$|E
2500|$|The American Revolutionary War {{divided the}} town, with the {{majority}} siding with the Patriot cause but families being split across both lines.

[...] The march of Benjamin Tallmadge, who led eighty men to the victorious overthrow of a British stronghold at Manor St. George, traversed along the town's western border.|$|E

2500|$|Marshal Stoudenmire {{heard the}} shot. Jumping {{up from his}} dining chair at the Globe Restaurant and pulling out his pistols, he ran out into the street. While running, Stoudenmire fired once, wildly, killing Ochoa, an {{innocent}} Mexican bystander, who was running for cover, but the first bullet struck its first target. [...] As the first gunfire shook ground, John Hale sobered up quickly and jumping behind a thick adobe pillar, but as he quickly <b>peered</b> <b>out</b> from behind it, Stoudenmire's aim was deadly accurate that the second bullet smashed right through between Hale's eyes, dropping and killing him instantly.|$|E
