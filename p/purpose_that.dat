5|$|A musical {{instrument}} is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound {{can be considered}} a {{musical instrument}}—it is through <b>purpose</b> <b>that</b> the object becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.|$|E
5|$|If the {{flagpoles}} {{have not}} the same height, the flag must be flown in the highest pole. The poles should be placed in honourable locations of the ground, building façades and roofs. On public acts where the flag is not hoisted, it can be suspended from a distinct spot, but never used as decoration, covering or for any <b>purpose</b> <b>that</b> can diminish its dignity.|$|E
5|$|The Bahá'í {{writings}} {{describe a}} single, personal, inaccessible, omniscient, omnipresent, imperishable, and almighty God {{who is the}} creator of all things in the universe. The existence of God and the universe {{is thought to be}} eternal, without a beginning or end. Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of creation, with a will and <b>purpose</b> <b>that</b> is expressed through messengers termed Manifestations of God.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} team also had significant {{problems with the}} scenes in the parking garage, and how to avoid the anatopism of contemporary cars being found on Caprica. In order to avoid this, the {{production team}} used cars mostly found in Eastern Europe, for the <b>purpose</b> <b>that</b> the audience would not immediately recognise the types of cars, but still to keep a sense of realism.|$|E
5|$|As Antoine {{decided to}} model Antoinist {{holidays}} on Catholicism, followers celebrate Christian holidays, including All Saints, Christmas, Easter, Easter Monday and Ascension; these days, appropriate portions of Antoine's works are read during the services. There are also three special days in Antoinism, and attendance at worship is generally higher at these moments: (1) 25 June, the Father's Day. It {{was established by}} Antoine's wife shortly after his death. At first, from 1913, all the temples except the one in Jemeppe were closed {{that day in the}} <b>purpose</b> <b>that</b> followers came to attend the ceremony in that city. So many Antoinists performed a pilgrimage to Jemeppe-sur-Meuse to participate in a procession through the city which outlined the main events of Antoine's life. The procession was withdrawn in 1937 and the pilgrimage seems to be no longer organized. That day, the faithful pay homage to the founder in the temples. (2) 15 August, the consecration of the temple's Day, which commemorates the consecration of the first temple. In 1911, on that day, the General Operation took place at the temple, then the ceremony continued into a public hall, which shocked followers; therefore, the following year, the whole ceremony took place exclusively in the temple. (3) 3 November, the Mother's Day, as anniversary of Catherine's death.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Burger King's actions, Hungry Jack's owner Jack Cowin and his private holding company Competitive Foods Australia began legal {{proceedings}} in 2001 against Burger King's parent Burger King Corporation with a counter-claim {{that the company had}} violated the conditions of the master franchising agreement and was in breach of the contract. In a decision handed down by the Supreme Court of New South Wales that affirmed Cowin's claims, Burger King was determined to have violated the terms of the contract and as a result was required to pay Cowin and Hungry Jack's a $46.9million (Aus, $41.6million USD 2001) award. The court's decision {{was one of the first}} major cases in Australia that implied that the American legal concept of good faith negotiations existed with the framework of the Australian legal system, which until that verdict, had rarely been seen in the country's courts. In its decision, the Court stated that Burger King had failed to act in good faith during contract negotiations by seeking to include standards and clauses that would engineer a default of the franchise agreement, allowing the company to limit the number of new Hungry Jack’s branded restaurants and ultimately claim the Australian market as its own, a <b>purpose</b> <b>that</b> was extraneous to the agreement.|$|E

5|$|For Catherine, these {{entertainments}} {{served a}} political <b>purpose</b> <b>that</b> made them worth their colossal expense. She {{presided over the}} royal government {{at a time when}} the French monarchy was in steep decline. With three of her sons on the throne in succession and the country torn by religious civil war, Catherine set out to show not only the French people but foreign courts that the Valois monarchy was as prestigious and magnificent as it had been during the reigns of Francis I and her husband Henry II. At the same time, she believed these elaborate entertainments and sumptuous court rituals, which incorporated martial sports and tournaments of many kinds, would occupy her feuding nobles and distract them from fighting against each other to the detriment of the country and the royal authority.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the instruments, the term taiko also refers to the performance itself, and commonly to one style called kumi-daiko, or ensemble-style playing (as opposed to festival performances, rituals, or theatrical use of the drums). Kumi-daiko was developed by Daihachi Oguchi in 1951. He is considered a master performer and helped transform taiko performance from its roots in traditional settings in festivals and shrines. Oguchi was trained as a jazz musician in Nagano, and at one point, a relative gave him an old piece of written taiko music. Unable to read the traditional and esoteric notation, Oguchi found help to transcribe the piece, and on his own added rhythms and transformed the work to accommodate multiple taiko players on different-sized instruments. Each instrument served a specific <b>purpose</b> <b>that</b> established present-day conventions in kumi-daiko performance.|$|E
5|$|These {{conflicts}} are {{demonstrated by the}} varying loyalties of the main characters. Genly Ai tells Argaven after Estraven's death that Estraven served mankind as a whole, just as Ai did. During the border dispute with Orgoreyn, Estraven tries to end the dispute by moving Karhidish farmers out of the disputed territory. Estraven believes that by preventing war he was saving Karhidish lives and being loyal to his country, while King Argaven {{sees it as a}} betrayal. At {{the end of the novel}} Ai calls his ship down to formalize Gethen's joining the Ekumen, and feels conflicted while doing so because he had promised Estraven that he would clear Estraven's name before calling his ship down. His decision is an example of Le Guin's portrayal of loyalty and betrayal as complementary rather than contradictory, because in joining Gethen with the Ekumen Ai was fulfilling the larger <b>purpose</b> <b>that</b> he shared with Estraven. Donna White wrote that many of Le Guin's novels depict a struggle between personal loyalties and public duties, best exemplified in The Left Hand of Darkness, where Ai is bound by a personal bond to Estraven, but must subordinate that to his mission for the Ekumen and humanity.|$|E

5|$|Weber was {{concerned}} {{with the question of}} objectivity and subjectivity. Weber distinguished social action from social behavior, noting that social action must be understood through how individuals subjectively relate to one another. Study of social action through interpretive means (Verstehen) must be based upon understanding the subjective meaning and <b>purpose</b> <b>that</b> individuals attach to their actions. Social actions may have easily identifiable and objective means, but much more subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another layer of subjective understanding (that of the scientist). Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of fool-proof, universal laws much more difficult than in natural sciences and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited. Overall, Weber supported the goal of objective science, but he noted that it is an unreachable goal– although one definitely worth striving for.|$|E

25|$|In The Welsh Opera, Fielding {{incorporated}} his editorial persona, Scriblerus Secundus, as {{a figure}} to connect the play with its companion piece, The Tragedy of Tragedies. However, in The Grub Street Opera Fielding drops all connections with The Tragedy of Tragedies. Scriblerus does introduce the play, as in the original, but he describes the moral <b>purpose</b> <b>that</b> motivates the play {{instead of being a}} comical connection with another work. After revealing Fielding's design in the play, Scriblerus leaves the stage.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{things can}} be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, {{although}} {{not in the same}} way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect.) Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or <b>purpose</b> <b>that</b> brings about an event. Our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino, because it cannot fall of its own accord.|$|E
