5|$|In the Catholic Church, {{display of}} a cross behind the shield is {{restricted}} to bishops as a mark of their dignity. The cross of an ordinary bishop has a single horizontal bar or traverse, {{also known as a}} Latin cross. A patriarch uses the patriarchal cross with two traverses, also called the cross of Lorraine. The <b>papal</b> <b>cross</b> has three traverses, but this is never displayed behind the papal arms.|$|E
25|$|All tarot cards {{also contain}} a {{representation}} of the pope, known as The Hierophant, in some cases crowned with a papal tiara.

5000|$|The {{original}} {{hanging in}} the background was a blue and gold textile, either woven silk or embroidery, with gold emblems in tear shaped light blue compartments against a dark blue background. The emblems were the <b>Papal</b> <b>crossed</b> keys, the <b>Papal</b> tiara, and perhaps the heraldic oak tree of Julius's family, the Della Rovere ("Of the oak"). This was overpainted by Raphael with the green cloth now seen, which itself was painted over before 1824 to give a plain dark background. [...] The finials of the chair are also formed as acorns to represent the Della Rovere emblem. The six finger rings with large jewels reflect another of Julius's obsessions, which caused Michelangelo to walk out from his service to him.|$|R

5000|$|On 1 August 1431 a large army of crusaders under Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg, {{accompanied}} by Cardinal Cesarini as <b>papal</b> legate, <b>crossed</b> the Bohemian border. On 8 August the crusaders reached {{the city of}} Domažlice and began besieging it. On 14 August, a Hussite relief army arrived, reinforced with some 6,000 Polish Hussites and {{under the command of}} Prokop the Great, and it completely routed the crusaders at the resulting Battle of Domažlice.

Tuscher's pay for organizing the Baron's collection was extremely modest, but he profited greatly from his learned patron's guidance in the sciences.

His head is thrown back and his arms raise a conch to his lips; from it a jet of water spurts, formerly rising dramatically higher than it does today. The fountain has a base of four dolphins that entwine the <b>papal</b> tiara with <b>crossed</b> keys and the heraldic Barberini bees in their scaly tails.|$|R

To the far right, holding a standard, is Eustace, Count of Boulogne (see detail below), with legend above, in upper margin: E...TIUS, standing for Eustatius, a Latinised version of [...] "Eustace." [...] The figure is said by others to be Turstin FitzRolf, said by Orderic Vitalis to have carried the Norman standard: Turstinus filius Rollonis vexillum Normannorum portavit, [...] "Turstin son of Rollo carried the standard of the Normans," [...] The Tapestry however depicts it as the <b>Papal</b> Banner, a <b>cross,</b> granted to the Duke by Pope Alexander II to signify papal approval of the Conquest of England.|$|R
5000|$|The {{coat of arms}} itself {{represents}} the three bees of the Barberini family. Each shield is enclosed by a woman's head {{at the top and}} by the head of a satyr at the bottom. A <b>papal</b> tiara with <b>crossed</b> keys surmounts the shield. All shields look nearly identical, but - if examined one after another starting with the left-hand front plinth - they reveal dramatic changes in the expression on the female face. The coat of arms itself, flat on the first plinth, undergoes a noticeable deformation, progressively bulging up to the sixth shield and flattening again on the last two shields. Above the eighth shield, the female face is replaced by the head of a winged child or putto. The allegory behind the coats of arms is unanimously interpreted as representing the various stages of childbirth. As Witkowski writes: The scene begins {{on the face of the}} left-hand front plinth; the woman's face begins to contract; on the second and following plinths the features pass through a series of increasingly violent convulsions. Simultaneously, the hair becomes increasingly dishevelled; the eyes, which at first express a bearable degree of suffering, take on a haggard look; the mouth, closed at first, opens, then screams with piercing realism. ... Finally, comes the delivery: the belly subsides and the mother's head disappears, to give way to a cherubic baby's head with curly hair, smiling beneath the unchanging pontifical insignia.|$|R
