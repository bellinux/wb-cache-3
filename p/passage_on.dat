5|$|It is {{possible}} that the anti-Semitic passages in her memoir were intended to be used as evidence that she was not Jewish; alternatively, she may have been influenced by Ezra Pound's anti-Semitic radio broadcasts. Whatever the case, she did help a Jewish couple escape Italy, providing <b>passage</b> <b>on</b> a ship to the United States. By {{the end of the war}} her sympathies had again changed, and she saw the Allies as liberators.|$|E
5|$|President James Monroe and Congress invited Lafayette {{to visit}} the United States in 1824, in part to {{celebrate}} the nation's upcoming 50thanniversary. Monroe intended to have Lafayette travel on an American warship, but the general felt having such a vessel as transport was undemocratic, and booked <b>passage</b> <b>on</b> a merchantman. LouisXVIII did not approve of the trip, and his officers had troops disperse the crowd that gathered at Le Havre to see Lafayette off.|$|E

5|$|A large {{squadron}} of ten frigates, including Aigle, was eventually {{able to make}} its way up the western <b>passage</b> <b>on</b> 9 August, enduring fire from batteries {{on both sides of}} the river for more than two hours. Aigle, in the centre, had her stern frame shattered when a shell fell through the deck and exploded, killing a marine and wounding four other members of the crew. She was the only ship to suffer any damage and her casualties amounted to almost half the total of two killed and nine wounded.|$|E
5|$|In late 1835, Davis sailed from New Orleans to Havana, Cuba, to {{help restore}} his health. He was {{accompanied}} by James Pemberton, his only slave at that time. Davis observed the Spanish military and sketched fortifications. Although no evidence points to his having any motive beyond general interest, the authorities knew that Davis was a former army officer and warned him to stop his observations. Bored and feeling somewhat better, Davis booked <b>passage</b> <b>on</b> a ship to New York, then continued to Washington, D.C., where he visited his old schoolmate George Wallace Jones. He soon returned with Pemberton to Mississippi.|$|E

Kimball had achieved record success in organizing new Rotary Club chapters, and the Arizona membership voted to pay {{for him and his}} wife to travel to the club's 1936 international convention in Nice, France. They went by train to Chicago and then to Montreal, where their oldest son, Spencer L., was serving as an LDS missionary. They traveled on a week-long <b>passage</b> <b>on</b> an ocean liner to Le Havre. From there, they visited Paris, Monte Carlo, Genoa, Rome, Pompeii, Florence, Venice, Vienna, the Swiss Alps, Belgium, the Netherlands, and London.|$|E
5|$|Rosenberg left Hawaii on June 7, 1887, booking {{steerage}} class <b>passage</b> <b>on</b> {{the steamer}} Australia. Some reports state {{that he left}} owing to health issues, although others suggest that Rosenberg departed the island because {{he was concerned about}} political unrest. He left three weeks before the king signed the June Constitution. Rosenberg returned to San Francisco, but was hospitalized within a month of his return, and died on July 10, 1887. He spoke of King Kalākaua on his deathbed, whispering the king's name with his dying breath. He was buried at the cemetery of Congregation Sherith Israel in the San Francisco Peninsula; brief death notices were published in Hawaii- and San Francisco-based newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Upon Alex's {{classification}} as {{a hurricane}} on January14, the Azores Meteorological Service issued a hurricane warning for {{the islands of}} Faial, Pico, São Jorge, Graciosa, and Terceira. They also issued a tropical storm warning for São Miguel and Santa Maria. A red alert—the highest stage for meteorological warnings—was declared for central and eastern islands. Homeowners protected doors and windows with plywood and sandbags in anticipation of damaging winds and flooding. Officials closed schools and administrative buildings {{for the duration of}} the hurricane on January15. SATA Air Açores cancelled 33domestic and international flights for the morning of January15, stranding more than 700passengers. The hurricane and tropical storm warnings were discontinued after Alex's <b>passage</b> <b>on</b> January15.|$|E

They had intended to leave early in 1620, but they were delayed several months due to difficulties {{in dealing with the}} Merchant Adventurers, including several changes in plans for the voyage and in financing. The congregation and the other colonists finally boarded the Speedwell in July 1620 in the Dutch port of Delfshaven.|$|E
5|$|After passing The Lizard {{the path}} turns northwards, {{continuing}} past Housel Bay and a building used by Guglielmo Marconi for radio experiments, then Bass Point with its Coastguard Station. The Lizard lifeboat station is a sheltered position in Kilcobben Cove. Passing through Cadgwith and across Kennack Sands, the path heads towards Black Head then into Coverack. Once around Lowland Point, The Manacles lie a mile offshore, a reef that has wrecked many ships. The path passes through Porthoustock and Porthallow, then around Nare Point lies Gillan Creek. This can be crossed {{at very low}} tide, but most walkers follow the lanes round {{the head of the}} creek to reach Dennis Head {{at the mouth of the}} Helford River. To cross this wider river means following it inland to Helford where there is a ferry across to Helford <b>Passage</b> <b>on</b> the north bank. Some people take a short cut from Gillan Creek to Helford by a path through Manaccan.|$|E
5|$|Any {{offensive}} planning by the U.S. was, however, {{limited by}} the <b>passage</b> <b>on</b> 29 December 1970 of the Cooper-Church Amendment, which prohibited U.S. ground forces and advisors from entering Laos. Dewey Canyon II would, therefore, be conducted within territorial South Vietnam in order to reopen Route 9 {{all the way to}} the old Khe Sanh Combat Base, which had been abandoned by U.S. forces in 1968. The base would be reopened and would then serve as the logistical hub and airhead of the ARVN incursion. U.S. combat engineers were tasked with clearing Route 9 and rehabilitating Khe Sanh while infantry and mechanized units secured a line of communications along the length of the road. American artillery units would support the ARVN effort within Laos from the South Vietnamese side of the border while Army logisticians coordinated the entire supply effort for the South Vietnamese. Air support for the incursion would be provided by the aircraft of the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, and U.S. Army aviation units were tasked with providing complete helicopter support for the ARVN operation.|$|E

40|$|The {{recovery}} of virulence {{by means of}} reversion of a live streptomycin-dependent (Sm D) Salmonella typhimurium vaccine was studied in CD- 1 Swiss mice. Initially, a one-step Sm D mutant was obtained from a virulent streptomycin-sensitive (Sm S) S. typhimurium strain. Afterwards, two pools of streptomycin-independent (Sm I) revertants were prepared from the Sm D strain. The virulence of the Sm D strain and of the Sm I revertants was tested intraperitoneally. In the virulence testing the original suspension of the Sm I revertants, {{as well as their}} 1 st and 10 th <b>passages</b> <b>on</b> plain medium, medium+ 50 mug. streptomycin/ml. and medium+ 1000 mug. streptomycin/ml. were used. The results show that the Sm D mutant was avirulent, its avirulence being due to an intrinsic, genetic quality. The Sm I revertants, compared to the original Sm S strain, also displayed a lack of virulence. However, afterwards, the Sm I revertants behaved quite differently, according to their subsequent passages. Indeed, there was an increase in virulence after <b>passages</b> <b>on</b> plain medium, whereas similar <b>passages</b> <b>on</b> medium containing the drug, the virulence not only failed to increase, but disappeared almost completely. Moreover, the <b>passages</b> <b>on</b> medium containing 1000 mug. streptomycin/ml. induced a return to the status of drug-dependence. The danger of {{recovery of}} virulence by means of revertants is evaluated...|$|R
5|$|Bachelot then {{traveled}} to California, {{where he served}} as an assistant minister while pastoring and teaching. In 1837, having learned of Queen Kaʻahumanu's death and King KamehamehaIII's willingness to allow Catholic priests on the island, Bachelot returned to Hawaii, intending to continue his missionary work. However, by Bachelot's arrival, KamehamehaIII had again {{changed his mind and}} Bachelot was removed from the island and confined to a ship for several months. He was freed only after the French and British navies imposed a naval blockade on the Honolulu harbor. Although he was later able to secure <b>passage</b> <b>on</b> a ship to Micronesia, he died en route and was buried on an islet near Pohnpei. His treatment in Hawaii prompted the government of France to dispatch a frigate to the island; the resulting intervention is known as the French Incident and led to the emancipation of Catholics in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|M-134 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Upper Peninsula (UP) of the US state of Michigan. It connects Interstate 75 (I-75) north of St. Ignace with the communities of Hessel, Cedarville and De Tour Village along Lake Huron. East of De Tour, the highway crosses the De Tour <b>Passage</b> <b>on</b> a ferry to run south {{of the community of}} Drummond on Drummond Island. It is one of only three state trunklines in Michigan on islands; the others are M-154 on Harsens Island and M-185 on Mackinac Island. M-134 is also one of only two highways to utilize a ferry in Michigan; the other is US Highway 10 (US10) which crosses Lake Michigan from Manitowoc, Wisconsin, to Ludington. Most of the mainland portion of M-134 is also part of the Lake Huron Circle Tour, and since 2015, it has been a Pure Michigan Byway under the name M-134 North Huron Byway.|$|E
5|$|One of the zoo's famous {{inhabitants}} {{during the}} post-war period was Voytek, a Syrian brown bear. Voytek {{had been sold}} {{to a group of}} Polish soldiers during the war. He learned to help the soldiers by carrying crates of ammunition, and became an unofficial mascot. In 1944 the Polish II Corps sailed to Italy to join the British 8th Army. Voytek had to be officially drafted into the Polish army in order to secure his <b>passage</b> <b>on</b> a British transport ship. In 1946 the II Corps were demobilised and settled in Scotland, at Winfield Camp near Hutton, Berwickshire. Voytek retired to Edinburgh Zoo in 1947 and lived there until his death in 1963. During his time in the army Voytek had developed a liking for cigarettes, and this may have contributed to his popularity as an attraction at the zoo.|$|E

5|$|Pinfold is very {{protective}} of his privacy, but uncharacteristically agrees {{to be interviewed}} on BBC radio. The main inquisitor is a man named Angel, whose voice and manner disconcert Pinfold, who believes he detects a veiled malicious intent. In the weeks that follow, Pinfold broods on the incident. He finds his memory beginning to play tricks on him. The encroaching winter depresses him further; he decides to escape by taking a cruise, and secures <b>passage</b> <b>on</b> the SS Caliban, bound for Ceylon. As the voyage proceeds, Pinfold finds that he hears sounds and conversations {{from other parts of}} the ship which he believes are somehow being transmitted into his cabin. Amid an increasingly bizarre series of overheard incidents, he hears remarks which become progressively more insulting, and then directly threatening towards himself. The main tormentors are a man and a woman, whose vicious words are balanced by those of an affectionate younger woman, Margaret. He is convinced that the man is the BBC interviewer Angel, using his technical knowledge to broadcast the voices. Pinfold spends sleepless nights, awaiting a threatened beating, a kidnapping attempt and a seductive visit from Margaret.|$|E
5|$|The Yemeni Government {{declared}} a state of emergency for Socotra shortly after the storm's <b>passage</b> <b>on</b> 1November. The local Red Cross gave cooked meals and tarps to the island's residents. Various Persian Gulf countries sent 43planes with supplies to the island by 19November. Neighboring Oman sent 14cargo planes' worth of food totaling 270tons worth of goods. The planes mostly carried food, as well as blankets and tents. The United Arab Emirates also sent a ship and a plane, carrying 500tons of food, 10tons of blankets and tents, and 1,200barrels of food. The International Organization for Migration provided 2,000shelter kits as well as a medical team to Socotra. Due to damage to the island's main port, residents built a makeshift pathway to help distribution of aid.|$|E

Another harbour tour vessel, the tern schooner Silva, broke from her moorings and caused extensive damage to the Cable Wharf on the Halifax Waterfront. Dozens of smaller yachts were also driven ashore; extensive damage occurred to yacht clubs in the Bedford Basin and Northwest Arm. Dozens of containers were knocked off two container ships at the South End Container Terminal. Wharves on the Halifax and Dartmouth waterfront suffered large amounts of damage and several railcars were washed into the harbour at the Dartmouth railway yard; one of the tracks for the double-track main line was washed out in several places along the Bedford Basin near Millview. Coastal flooding was also reported around Halifax Harbour {{as a result of the}} storm surge, although inland flooding was minor as rainfall was not heavy due to Juan's fast forward movement.|$|E
