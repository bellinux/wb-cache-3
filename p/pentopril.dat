40|$|The th#{ 149 }oretical {{evaluation}} of a pharmacokinetic precursor/metabo-gte model was accomplished utilizing an Integral approach based on clarance. Particular {{attention was paid to}} prodrugs where a single active Intermediate resufts dIrectly from the parent drug. This model, however, can be utilized for any drug In which a single first-pass metabolic adduct resufts. Complete elucidatiOn of the first-pass and metabolic systemic pharmacoklnetlcs is possible when plasma and urine concentration data are available after only oral drug adminis-tratlon. The generalfty of the model does not require prior knowledge of whether the metabolfte was formed systemically or presystemi-cally, and only limfted metabolic pathway profiling.
