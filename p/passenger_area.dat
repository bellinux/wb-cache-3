25|$|Concourse E had 22 gates: E1–E22. Concourse E was a <b>passenger</b> <b>area</b> {{connected}} to the airport's landside terminal and was formerly used for quick access to US Airways Express commuter aircraft. Following cuts in service by US Airways, all Concourse E gates were closed to all passenger air traffic. Concourse E was demolished prior to November 1, 2011. It is now the parking lot for all Air Mall employees. A {{small part of the}} terminal not dedicated to the parking serves as a branch for the alternative security checkpoint to cut long lines at the airport during peak travel times.|$|E

25|$|After {{turning off}} the runway {{to the left and}} {{attempting}} a ground loop, the aircraft continued into Village Creek. The right wheel dropped off the 12-foot (3.7-m)-high bank first, allowing the right wing to strike rocks on the bank. The DC-3 then spun to the right and struck the south bank of the 35-foot (10.7-m)-wide creek. Village Creek was swollen from the rain which had plagued the Southern United States in the days of and before the accident, with widespread flooding and deaths due to tornadoes in neighboring Mississippi the day of the accident. The plane came to rest nose-down with the <b>passenger</b> <b>area</b> suspended over the waters of the creek. Though the cockpit was crushed, the passenger cabin was largely undamaged and no fire resulted. Rescue personnel alerted by the tower immediately worked to evacuate passengers and rescue the three critically injured pilots in the cockpit.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{involvement}} was in Bessemer's disastrous attempts {{to produce a}} ship with a stabilised <b>passenger</b> <b>area,</b> the SS Bessemer, for which Galloways supplied the hydraulic equipment. The concept had been that a saloon within the vessel would be supported {{in such a way}} as not to pitch, roll or yaw as the ship sailed. (The ship's manoeuvrability was poor and, having crashed on its maiden voyage, investors lost confidence and the project was abandoned with the equipment remaining untested.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Coupé: A 2-door, 2- or 4-seat {{car with}} a fixed roof. Its doors are often longer than those of an {{equivalent}} sedan and the rear <b>passenger</b> <b>area</b> smaller; the roof may also be low. In cases where the rear seats are very small and not intended for regular use it is called a 2+2 (pronounced [...] "two plus two"). Originally, a coupé was required to have only one side window per side, but this consideration has not been used for many years. Occasionally seen as Fixed Head Coupé, or FHC, particularly when referring to a hardtop version of a convertible.|$|E

2500|$|Ultimately, and in {{line with}} Roy Abernethy's new {{marketing}} strategy, {{the decision was made}} to build the new fastback model on AMC's intermediate-sized Rambler Classic platform. The development team, under distinguished American designer Richard A. Teague, had to work with considerably smaller budgets than their counterparts at Detroit's Big Three to create the new Marlin. They created a large, roomy and luxurious fastback which incorporated a number of design features from the Tarpon show car. The signature roof line from the windshield with the Marlin's [...] "skylight permits carrying through the true fastback line in an unbroken sweep." [...] However, the roof was raised over the rear <b>passenger</b> <b>area</b> when Abernethy, who was six-foot-four (193cm tall), insisted on being able to sit in the back seat of the design studies. Teague worked for Chrysler as a stylist during the mid-1950s and the fastback-styling of the lost 1956 Chrysler Norseman concept car's [...] "resemblance to (that of) the 1965 Rambler Marlin fastback coupe, or vice versa, was (said to be) uncanny." ...|$|E
