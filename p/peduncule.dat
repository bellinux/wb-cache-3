5000|$|The densely {{distributed}} neurons of the {{pars compacta}} have larger and thicker dendritic arborizations {{than those of}} the pars reticulata and lateralis.The ventral dendrites descending in the pars reticulata receives inhibitory synapses from the initial axonal collaterals of pars reticulata neurons (Hajos and Greefield, 1994). Groups of dopaminergic neurons located more dorsally and posteriorly in the tegmentum are of the same type without forming true nuclei. The [...] "cell groups A8 and A10" [...] are spread inside the cerebral <b>peduncule.</b> They are not known to receive striatal afferences and are not in a topographical position to do so. The dopaminergic ensemble is thus also on this point inhomogeneous. This is another major difference with the pallidonigral ensemble. The axons of the dopaminergic neurons, that are thin and varicose, leave the nigra dorsally. They turn round the medial border of the subthalamic nucleus, enter the H2 field above the subthalamic nucleus, then cross the internal capsule to reach {{the upper part of the}} medial pallidum where they enter the pallidal laminae, from which they enter the striatum. They end intensively but inhomogeneously in the striatum, rather in the matrix of the anterior part and rather in the striosomes dorsalwards. These authors insit on the extrastriatal dopaminergic innervation of other elements of the basal ganglia system: pallidum and subthalamic nucleus.|$|E
50|$|The living animal has {{a general}} orange color. The whole dorsum has brown dots except the tips or {{apex of the}} lateral {{appendage}}s, which are pale yellow. The dorsum has a white diamond shaped spot that runs from the behind of the rhinophores to the tail (just behind the branchial leaves). The end of the foot is acute and has a similar color to the appendage apices. Two types of appendages are observed. The first type of appendages are longer and wider and are positioned at {{the margin of the}} sides of the animal. These appendages have apical ramifications that are rounded at the base with a long, thin and sharp prolongation. Small acute ramifications cover the remaining parts of the appendage. The second type of appendage is thin, long with many small sharp, thin and long simple ramifications. These appendages are present on the entire body, sides, foot, and dorsum. The oral veil has four appendages, two of which are longer, situated at the lateral edges of the oral veil and two that are shorter situated in the center. The rhinophores have a lamellate clavus and a <b>peduncule</b> with acute ramifications. Each rhinophoral sheath edge has three ramifications. The middle one is virtually identical to the lateral appendages. The other two ramifications are similar to the smaller tentacles {{of the rest of the}} body. The oral tentacles are simple folds of the mantle with the appearance of cylinders. The three branchial leaves are tripinnate. They have the same simple and thin ramifications as the smaller appendages.|$|E

These brown dots are similar and size and {{regularly}} distributed. The dorsum has an opaque white, irregularly shaped line, which runs {{from the front of}} the head to the posterior end of the notum. This line bifurcates at the level of the branchial leaves, where it surrounds them and remerges again behind the branchial leaves. The posterior end of the foot is thin and acute and has a yellow color similar to that of the lateral appendage apices. Two types of appendages are observed in the specimen. The first type of appendages is the longest and widest. There are three pairs of these lateral appendages situated along the margin of the sides. These appendages have a ramified apex. Each ramification of the apex has a rounded base and a long, thin and sharp prolongation. The whole length of each of these appendages is covered by little and acute ramifications. The second type of appendages, are thin, long with many small sharp, thin and long simple ramifications. These appendages are present on the sides of the body, foot, dorsum and oral veil in number 15-17 per side with 6 on the oral veil. The rhinophores have a lamellate clavus and a <b>peduncule</b> with little, thin and sharp ramifications. Each rhinophoral sheath edge has three ramifications.

40|$|During {{the late}} spring of 2013 {{strawberry}} plants (Fragaria × ananassa Duch. 'Elsanta') were showing an intense blackening of their immature fruits, their fruit calyxes and the <b>peduncule</b> were found at several locations (greenhouses) in The Netherlands. Symptoms include brown petals, green young fruits turning brown, malformed fruits and bacterium slime (ooze) formation {{on the surface of}} the young fruits. Fruits did not develop or were in many cases heavily malformed. In certain cases 40 % of the crop was lost. Isolations from these symptomatic immature strawberry fruits yielded Erwinia-like colonies on YPG (yeast peptone glucose) agar. The isolates differed biochemically from E. amylovora and they were closely related to biochemical profiles of the Erwinia pyrifoliae reference strain LMG 25888. The isolates were further identified as E. pyrifoliae based on the real time PCR assay. Pathogenicity of several isolates was tested and confirmed on potted strawberry plants ('Elsanta' and 'Selva'). Honeybees from pollinating colonies were tested to detect E. pyrifoliae in a flowering strawberry greenhouse cultivation. Host range, mechanisms of survival and spread of this new Erwinia species on strawberry will be discussed. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Lesion {{dissemination}} in {{time and}} space represents a key feature and diagnostic marker of multiple sclerosis (MS). The correlation between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesion load and disability is only modest, however. Strategic lesion location might at least partially account for this 'clinico-radiologic paradox'. OBJECTIVES: Here we used a non-parametric permutation-based approach to map lesion location probability based on MS lesions identified on T 2 -weighted MRI. We studied 121 patients with clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS and correlated these maps to assessments of neurologic and cognitive functions. RESULTS: The Expanded Disability Status Scale correlated with bilateral periventricular lesion location (LL), and sensory and coordination functional system deficits correlated with lesion accumulation in distinct anatomically plausible regions, i. e. thalamus and middle cerebellar <b>peduncule.</b> Regarding cognitive performance, decreased verbal fluency correlated with left parietal LL comprising the putative superior longitudinal fascicle. Delayed spatial recall correlated with _amygdalar, _left frontal and parietal LL. Delayed selective reminding correlated with bilateral frontal and temporal LL. However, only part of the spectrum of cognitive and neurological problems encountered in our cohort could be explained by specific lesion location. CONCLUSIONS: Lesion probability mapping supports the association of specific lesion locations with symptom development in MS, but only to limited extent...|$|E
40|$|A taxonomic {{revision}} of Hyphessobrycon boulengeri (Eigenmann, 1907) and H. reticulatus Ellis, 1911 populations is {{presented with the}} description of a new species. A total of 600 specimens from southeastern and south Brazil were examined, ranging from Espírito Santo to Rio Grande do Sul. Morphometric multivariate analysis, osteologic characters, and color pattern allowed to recognition of H. boulengeri as valid species, occurring in coastal drainages from Rio de Janeiro to Rio Grande do Sul, and upper Paraná, Iguaçu, and Uruguay rivers, and a new species was found from rio Doce and rio da Prata in Espírito Santo State. H. boulengeri is diagnosed by presenting a humeral spot vertically elongate and relatively rounded; a narrow midlateral dark stripe in flank, weakly joined to caudal-peduncle blotch; caudal peduncle spot usually diamond shaped, with rounded edges; body with reticulated pattern formed by cromatophores concentration on posterior margin of scales; a narrow stripe on anal fin base and bony hooks strongly curved and very conspicuous on anal fin of males larger than 32. 1 mm. Hyphessobrycon sp 1. n. differs from the majority of congeners by the following combination of characters: a rounded humeral spot, sometimes with diffuse vertical tips; caudal <b>peduncule</b> blotch slightly rounded, extending onto middle caudal fin rays in few specimens; midlateral dark stripe absent in flank; body scales with intense pigmentation on their margins, forming a reticulated pattern; narrow lateral stripe along anal fin base, and 3 rd and 4 th infraorbitals coossified. Furthermore Hyphessobrycon sp 1. n. is separated from H. boulengeri {{by the absence of}} midlateral dark stripe on flank and the co-ossification of infraorbitals 3 rd and 4 th.

40|$|Abstract. Eclipta prostrata, a weed {{distributed}} in the rice-fields of some Mediterranean countries in Europe, is recorded from the Aleko islands group (Rouse district) {{for the first time}} in Bulgaria. Key words: Aleko islands group, alien species, Eclipta prostrata, Northeast Bulgaria During fieldwork on the Aleko islands group, Zdravkov island, in 2006, the author found a new species for the flora of Bulgaria, from the family Asteraceae, tribe Heliantheae. Annual, multibranched, strigose, erect or prostrate plant, 20 – 90 cm tall. Leaves opposite, acute at base, 4 – 13 × 0. 8 – 2 cm, pilose, oblong to lanceolate, re-motely serrate, acute-acuminate, the lower sessile or petiolate. Capitulae terminal and axillary, several to many, hemispherical, up to 1 cm wide, heterogamous. <b>Peduncule</b> up to 7 cm long. Involucral bracts herba-ceous, ovate, acute, appressed-pubescent, 6 mm long. Receptacular scales setaceous, ciliate at apex; disc-flo-rets perfect; ray-florets pistillate, with 4 – 5 -fid corolla; ligules c. 6 mm, white, entire or bifid. Anthers apical-ly blunt, basally slightly sagittate. Achenes of ray-flo-rets triangular, of disc-florets four-angular, all tuber-culate, black, glabrous, except for a few apical hairs, depressed-truncate at apex, with 1 – 3 minute marginal teeth, about 3 mm long, marginally ribbed. The blossoming and fruiting period in Bulgaria is probably from July to October and depends on the water level of the Danube River.

40|$|With {{the purpose}} of stablishing the effects of various plantregulators on the growth and {{development}} of the ear shoots in, both, the prolific corn MB 510 and the non prolific one MB 513, four experiments ere carried out at randon blocks design with three replica. Three doses of the regulators IAA, MH, GA 3, eee, Ethrel and Kinetine were used. Each plant reeeíved four applications of the hormonal treatment at the following development stages: Tassel diferentiation, ear shoot diferentiation, tassel emergence and silk emergence. The regulator capacity to induce increment {{on the development of the}} second, third and fourth ear shoots in the prolific corn as well as on the second and third ear shoot of the non prolific corn was studied. In the two genotypes "secundary" ear shoots were completely developpedwhich were diferenciated on the <b>peduncule</b> of the main ear shoot. The general effect was an increment of the prolificity as follows: In the MB 510 corn: IAA (100 ppm) resulted in an increment of 0. 82; MH (100 ppm), 0. 85; GA 3 (600 ppm), 1. 13; eee (200 ppm), 0. 65; Ethrel (100 ppm), 0. 33 ear shoots per planto In the MB 513 corn: IAA (200) increased 0. 66; Ethrel (500 ppm), 0. 39; GA 3,(30 ppm) 0. 66 ear shootsper planto The vaious treatments also modified the grain numbers per plant 'and the accumulation of biomass in them. However, the absense of signifíeance in the mayority of results is believed to be related to the degree of regularity in the plant responses to the various treatments or, perhps a redistribution of the accumulated matter among the grainsand the formed ear shoots took place without a sígníficant increase of accumulated dry matter. It is possible to assume that the similar responses to different treatments are related to the modífícation that those treatments could have produced on the auxin content of the plant. Con el propósito de determinar los efectos de diferentes reguladores sobre el crecimiento y desarrollo de mazorcas en el maíz prolífico MB 510 y en el no prolífico MB 513, se realizaron cuatro ensayos bajo un diseño de bloques completos al azar, con tres réplicas. Se emplearon tres concentraciones de: AIA e HM; AG 3 y CCC; Ethrel y Kinetina. Las plantas recibieron cuatro aplicaciones del tratamiento hormonal respectivo, en las edades en las que se efectuaban: La diferenciación de la espiga, diferenciación de mazorcas, emergencia de la espiga y pistilos respectivamente. En la mayoría de los ensayos se comprobó la capacidad de los reguladores para aumentar el número de mazorcas desarrolladas totalmente como fueron: la segunda, tercera y cuarta en el maíz prolífico y la segunda y tercera en el no prolífico. En ambos genotipos se desarrollaron mazorcas "secundarias" diferenciadas sobre el pedúnculo de las mazorcas principales. El efecto general fue el incremento del grado de prolificidad, así: en MB 510, AlA (100 ppm), aumentó 0. 82; HM (100 ppm), 0. 85; AG 3 (600 ppm), 1. 13; CCC (200 ppm), 0. 65; Ethrel+(100 ppm), 0. 33 mazorcas por planta. En MB 513, AlA (200 ppm), aumentó 0. 66; AG 3 (30 ppm), 0. 66; Ethrel (500 ppm), 0. 39 mazorcas por planta. Los diferentes tratamientos también modificaron el número de granos por planta y la acumulación de biomasa en ellos. Sin embargo, la falta de signíficancía en la mayoría de los resultados, se relaciona con la regularidad en las respuestas de las plantas a los tratamientos o que quizá se presentó una redistribución de los asimilados entre el total de los granos y mazorcas formadas sin que se incrementara significativamente la materia seca en ellos acumulada. Tal vez, las respuestas similares obtenidas con los diferentes tratamientos se relacionan con la modificación que estos últimos pudieron haber ejercido sobre el contenido de auxina en las plantas. ...|$|E
