He later married and started a family with an Indonesian woman, but she left him in 2007 due to his unstable income and inability to hold down a job.

In mitigation, Lee's <b>pro</b> <b>bono</b> lawyer said that there was no sign on Pedra Branca warning against trespassing on the island. Lee was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment.|$|E
