5|$|The Erie Art Museum is the city's main art gallery, {{located in}} the Old Customshouse on State Street. Its {{collection}} has an emphasis on folk art and modern art and it hosts a popular blues and jazz concert series. The Erie Art Museum also works on <b>public</b> <b>art</b> projects {{in an effort to}} revitalize and improve the city. In 2000, the Erie Art Museum created a project entitled GoFish, similar to CowParade. 95 fiberglass fish were decorated by Erie artists and placed throughout the city. Patrons paid $3,000 for a fish and the proceeds went to Gannon University's Scholarship Fund and the Erie <b>Public</b> <b>Art</b> Endowment Fund. The Erie Art Museum created a similar <b>public</b> <b>art</b> project in 2004 that involved frogs rather than fish. In 2012, the Erie Art Museum began a project to create forty artistic and functional bike racks, designed and created by local artists. The museum's intentions are to add color and interest to downtown Erie and to promote bicycling, encouraging healthy lifestyles and environmental awareness.|$|E
5|$|The {{stations}} {{along the}} UTA TRAX network are open-air structures featuring passenger canopies {{for protection from}} adverse weather. Many of the canopies are designed to resemble the canopy at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building (which is located Downtown and listed on the National Register of Historic Places). Works of <b>public</b> <b>art</b> included at several stations were developed {{as part of the}} UTA's Art in Transit program. At first the program was met with skepticism; initially, only the stations constructed in Salt Lake City incorporated <b>public</b> <b>art</b> into their designs. This was the case as the city was initially the only one {{to take part in the}} Art in Transit program. The program has since grown in popularity, and many of the stations constructed as part of the FrontLines 2015 expansion will include <b>public</b> <b>art</b> in their final design.|$|E

50|$|Prior {{to their}} merger in 2007 the Lancaster International Concert Series, Peter Scott Gallery, and Nuffield Theatre were {{operated}} separately.
