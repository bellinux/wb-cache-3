30|$|As the taxa we {{collected}} for chloroplast and nuclear phylogenetic analyses were not exactly identical, multi-species coalescent phylogenetic trees (Drummond and Rambaut 2007; Heled and Drummond 2010) were reconstructed based on combinations of genomic markers {{and the two}} target markers separately. Consequently, three trees were developed as data structures for further analysis: the cpDNA[*]+[*]nrITS tree (64 species), the cpDNA tree (81 species), and the nrITS tree (70 species). Since extinction events in Lithocarpus are rare (Cannon and Manos 2003; Xing et al. 2014), {{it is likely that}} the rare event is overestimated from incomplete taxon sampling. Therefore the extinctions were deliberately excluded from species tree reconstruction to explain the species diversification, and we considered only cladogenesis and biogeographical factors. Yule’s pure-birth model that ignores the death (extinction) rate parameter was adopted for phylogeny reconstruction. The general-time-reversible substitution model (GTR) together with a gamma and invariant site heterogeneity model by BEAST ver. 1.7. 3 (Drummond and Rambaut 2007) were used. Since the ucld.stdev parameter estimate deviated from zero, to account for the rate of heterogeneity among lineages in both markers (95 % HPD of ucld.stdev[*]=[*] 0.849 [*]~[*] 1.289 and 0.759 [*]~[*] 1.407 in ITS and cpDNA, respectively) we have used the uncorrelated lognormal (UCLN) relaxed clock model instead of the strict clock model to estimate divergence times of about 40 Mya from the outgroup genus Chrysolepis (Kvaček and Walther 1989). Five independent <b>pre-runs</b> of ten-million generations of the length of MCMC were performed to obtain better parameter priors for the following three independent 50 -million generations of the MCMC process. Genealogies for each lineage were sampled every 10, 000 generations and the initial 10 – 25 % of the sample run was discarded as burn-in according to the simulation trajectory. The output data containing all the statistics were summarized by TRACER ver. 1.5 (Rambaut and Drummond 2003) and both log and tree files of the last five runs were combined using LogCombiner ver. 1.6. 1 (Drummond and Rambaut 2007). We resampled the originally simulated trees with a sampling frequency of 8000 and 6000 trees for ITS and cpDNA, respectively, to reduce the number of trees by LogCombiner ver. 1.6. 1 and the posterior samples of trees were summarized by TreeAnnotator ver. 1.6. 1 (Drummond and Rambaut 2007).

We expected that following a pacer would associate with goal achievement, higher <b>pre-run</b> confidence, positive emotions and lower perceived exertion during performance.

We suggest that following a pacer is a skill that requires learning.

Subjects were matched based on relative maximal back squat strength or average projected race pace, age, body weight, and fat free mass. Subjects were randomly assigned to ingest, in a double blind manner, capsules containing a placebo (P) or powdered tart cherries [CherryPURE?] (TC). Participants supplemented one time daily (480 mg/d) for 10 -d including the day of exercise up to 48 -hr post-exercise. Resistance study subjects performed 10 sets of 10 repetitions at 70 % 1 -RM back squat exercise, while endurance subjects completed a half-marathon run (21. 1 km) under 2 -hr (111. 98 ? 11. 9 min). Fasting blood samples and quadriceps muscle soreness ratings were taken pre-exercise, 60 -min, 24 -h, and 48 -h post-exercise and analyzed by MANOVA with repeated measures. Muscle soreness perception in the vastus medialis (1 / 4) (p= 0. 10) and the vastus lateralis (1 / 4) (p= 0. 024) tended to be lower in TC over time compared to P following resistance exercise. TC induced changes in serum creatinine (p= 0. 03, p= 0. 047) and total protein (p= 0. 018, p= 0. 081) that were lower over time and smaller from pre-lift levels compared to P in trained individuals. Despite lower TAS activity <b>pre-run</b> in TC compared to P (endurance), changes from <b>pre-run</b> levels revealed a linear increase in TAS activity during recovery in TC that was statistically different from P and <b>pre-run</b> levels. IL- 6 levels (endurance) were lower in TC compared to P over time (p= 0. 053).

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether there are different changes in Achilles tendon (AT) mechanical properties in middle-aged, compared to younger runners that might indicate that tendon fatigue, induced by long-distance running, is age-dependent. METHODS: 27 middle-aged (50 - 67  years) and 22 younger (21 - 29  years) participants ran a 21  km route at their own pace (mean and SD: old: 3. 1  ±  0. 3  m s(- 1); young: 3. 6  ±  0. 5  m s(- 1)). We tested for changes in the AT force-elongation relationship using dynamometry and ultrasonography during isometric voluntary ankle plantarflexion ramp contractions, conducted 20 - 28  h <b>pre-run,</b> immediately <b>pre-run,</b> immediately post-run and 20 - 28  h post-run. Stride frequency and number were examined to estimate cyclic tensile loading characteristics of the tendon during running. RESULTS: Muscle strength decreased significantly (P <  0. 05) in both groups immediately post-run (old: 17  %; young: 11  %) and recovered to baseline within 20 - 28  h post-run. AT stiffness did not change for the younger adults, whereas the middle-aged adults showed a significant (P <  0. 05) decrease in AT stiffness (22  %). However, tendon stiffness recovered to baseline 20 - 28  h post-run. Middle-aged, compared to young adults, demonstrated significantly (P <  0. 05) greater stride frequency and number, but no correlations with tendon fatigue changes were determined (R (2)  ≤  0. 038). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the plasticity of the AT in response to short-term mechanical loading may be age dependent and that the AT length-tension properties of middle-aged runners may be more vulnerable to change following running compared to younger athletes. However, the observed AT changes in the middle-aged runners dissipated within 20 - 28  h post-run, suggesting that a tendon viscoelastic recovery mechanism may occur in vivo...|$|E

40|$|SENSOR is an Integrated Project {{within the}} 6 th Framework {{program of the}} EU. The major outcome is the {{modeling}} approach Sustainable Impact Assessment Tool (SIAT). The knowledge-based model SIAT enables end users to assess the impacts of land-use relevant EU-policy strategies. The results are presented for European administrative regions (NUTS), though for specific issues the grid resolution of 1 x 1 km will be used. The six sectors agriculture, forestry, energy, transport, nature conversation and tourism are considered. Analytically, SIAT focuses on cross-sectoral trade offs and side effects of the impacts of new introduced EU-policies. The model concept {{is based on a}} wide set of <b>pre-run</b> model results that are implemented into SIAT in a consistent way. SIAT is a problem- and user-oriented tool that allows end users to modify basic parameter sets of Sustainability Impact Assessment according to the methodological framework of the EU-guidelines. SIAT facilitates analysis of impacts from policies and the process that lead to those impacts. Additionally it checks whether the impacts are within sustainability tolerance limits. In a first step the SIA-Tool is able to interpolate iteratively mechanistically single policy variables, but it will be widened by a generic approach that allows simultaneous simulations of newly grouped policy variables. Main challenges of the modeling approach are the consistent integration of <b>pre-run</b> model results by translating the policy variables into land use claims and land use claims into indicator values. A major challenge within the project is to keep all translations transparent. SIAT will comprise a wide set of integrated policy instruments to be assessed simultaneously within bundles of policy variable sets that are currently of high importance in EU policy discussions. In this regard SIAT addresses the user group of EC policy maker, related joint research institutes and corresponding consultancies dedicated to outsourced Impact Assessments. A first prototype has been developed in October 2005. The second prototype will be developed at the beginning of June 2006...|$|E
40|$|AbstractModel-checking {{can provide}} {{valuable}} {{insight into the}} behaviour of biochemical systems, answering quantitative queries which {{are more difficult to}} answer using stochastic simulation alone. However, model-checking is a computationally intensive technique which can become infeasible if the system under consideration is too large. Moreover, the finite nature of the state representation used means that a priori bounds must be set for the numbers of molecules of each species to be observed in the system. In this paper we present an approach which addresses these problems by using stochastic simulation and the PRISM model checker in tandem. The stochastic simulation identifies reasonable bounds for molecular populations {{in the context of the}} considered experiment. These bounds are used to parameterise the PRISM model and limit its state space. A simulation <b>pre-run</b> identifies interesting time intervals on which model-checking should focus, if this information is not available from experimental data...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} for injury {{is present in}} all forms of physical activity, particularly events involving repetitive motion. In attempt to identify kinematic changes following running induced reductions in muscular strength, 15 participants completed recorded treadmill runs before and after an outdoor run. Kinematics were recorded using a Vicon motion capture system and processed using 3 D GAIT custom software. Using repeated measures ANCOVA with side (dominant and non-dominant) and time (<b>pre-run</b> and post-run) as within subject factors, and strength and arch height as covariates, {{no statistically significant differences}} were obtained. Using Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficients to compare successive strides, post-run reductions in stride-to-stride correlation were obtained for dominant and non-dominant knees. Further, MANOVA analysis using standard deviation values corresponding to thirds of stance phase suggested that dominant and non-dominant ankle, as well as dominant knee frontal plane movements became more variable following the run, primarily during the initial third of stance...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} bioelectricity {{production}} from pure culture of Bacillus tequilensis DMR- 5 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa DMR- 3. Both the cultures were isolated from the anodic biofilm of <b>pre-run</b> MFCâs with rumen fluid as anodic substance. They were checked for the power production for 10 days both as pure isolates and co-culture. Bacillus tequilensis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa produced 250 mV and 20 mA, 310 mV and 10 mA respectively. Both these bacteria when used as mixed culture (110 Ã 10 5 CFU/mL) produced 450 mV and 40 mA. The biofilm of the anode was taken for cyclic voltammetry study and the oxidation and reduction peaks observed in both forward and reverse scan confirmed the electrochemical nature of the bacteria. Based on the power readings measured and cyclic voltammograms obtained, {{it has been found}} that the co-culture produced more power than the pure cultures when used individually in the Microbial fuel cell...|$|E
