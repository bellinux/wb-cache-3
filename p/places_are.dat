5|$|Alyssa {{is given}} no {{weaponry}} during {{the majority of}} the game, other than a limited supply of holy water, which can be used to temporarily stun pursuing Subordinates. Within each level, the Subordinate can appear in any location after a set period of time, but also randomly or if Alyssa makes noise. They also appear in certain set locations. When one appears, it immediately begins to chase Alyssa, attempting to kill her. The player must either hide from or evade it. Evasion can only be accomplished in certain places, and each evasion point can only be used once. Using an evasion point does not kill the Subordinate, but instead renders them unconscious for a set time. The primary means of eluding one, however, is by hiding. There are multiple hiding points throughout each level, and each one can be used multiple times. However, hiding <b>places</b> <b>are</b> ineffective if the Subordinate sees Alyssa enter them.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Trigger {{features}} standard role-playing {{video game}} gameplay. The player controls the protagonist {{and his companions}} in the game's two-dimensional fictional world, consisting of various forests, cities, and dungeons.

Areas such as forests, cities, and similar <b>places</b> <b>are</b> depicted as more realistic scaled-down maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. Chrono Triggers gameplay deviates from that of traditional Japanese RPGs in that, rather than appearing in random encounters, many enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the map rather than on a separate battle screen.|$|E

5|$|In {{this event}} {{there is a}} {{qualification}} round on the opening day, in which 40 to 70 athletes each jump once to ensure their place {{for the rest of}} the event's two individual competitions. 40 of these <b>places</b> <b>are</b> available in the first competition (compared to 50 in the similar Ski Jumping World Championships), which is narrowed down to 30 for the second competition. The order of jumps – or 'starting order' – in the qualification round is based on the athletes' current rank within the Ski Jumping World Cup standings in ascending order of points, with the leader (who is assigned a distinctive yellow bib) going last. A unique feature of the World Cup, which applies to all ski flying and ski jumping events, is that the top ten ranked athletes are in a 'pre-qualified' bracket: their place in the event is already secure, so their qualification jump is entirely optional.|$|E
5|$|In total, 415 {{types of}} plants and 86 species of {{mushroom}} are recorded in the area. A number of local flower types are considered endemic to the Balkans, such as Dianthus deltoides and Allium breviradum. On the other hand, many endemic plants of central and northern Greece grow also in the park, like the Centaurea vlachorum. Moreover, rare species of the forests of Pindus mountains, typical of the lower geological layers, are Minuartia baldaci, Bornmuellera tymphaea, Campanula hawkinsiana, Viola dukadjinica and Silene pindicola. The most important places for the gathering of rare plants are the northern slopes of the peaks of Aftia, Flegga and Kapetan Kleidi. All the above <b>places</b> <b>are</b> very steep and difficult for grazing animals and therefore natural regeneration of the forest {{in this area is}} progressing normally and many rare plants are conserved. The serpentine soil, which is dominant {{in the area of the}} Pindus National Park also favors the growing of rare endemic plant species.|$|E
