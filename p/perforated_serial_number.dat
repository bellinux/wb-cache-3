5000|$|... #Caption: This ORC {{membership}} card for 1912 features a <b>perforated</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> {{reminiscent of the}} train tickets punched by conductors.|$|E
5000|$|Units {{include the}} VIP squadron, flying Embraer ERL-135LRs (<b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 1084/HS-AMP and <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 1124), two Jetstream 41s (<b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> 41060 and 41094), two Casa 212-300s (<b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> 446 and 447), and two Beech 1900C-1s (<b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> 0169 and 0170) and the 1st Infantry Battalion {{operating}} two Bell 206Bs (<b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> 4422 and 4448), three Schweizer S-300Cs (<b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> 1340, 1366 and 1367), and two Cessna U-17B FAC aircraft (<b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> 1616 and 1617).|$|R
50|$|<b>Serial</b> <b>number</b> {{comparisons}} {{are intended to}} use <b>Serial</b> <b>Number</b> Arithmetic as defined in RFC 1982. However, this was not clearly specified in RFC 1034, resulting in not all clients perform the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> check, in the preamble, in the same way. Some clients check merely that the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> supplied by the server {{is different from that}} known by the client, or non-zero. Other clients check that the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> supplied by the server is within a given range of the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> already known by the client. Yet other clients still perform the latter check and additionally check that the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> supplied by the server is not zero.|$|R
50|$|<b>Serial</b> <b>numbers</b> {{help make}} {{legitimate}} documents easier {{to track and}} audit. To help detect forgeries <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> will normally have a Check digit to verify the <b>serial</b> <b>number.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{predictable}} <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> {{attack is}} a form of security exploit in which the algorithm for generating <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> for a particular purpose is guessed, discovered, or reverse engineered, a new <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> is predicted using the algorithm, and the newly generated <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> is then used for a fraudulent purpose, either to obtain an undeserved benefit or to deny service to the legitimate holder of the <b>serial</b> <b>number.</b>|$|R
50|$|A common {{approach}} to prevent predictable <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> attacks {{is to use}} a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-2 to generate the actual <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b> Internally, the issuing organization creates a (pseudo-)random nonce as a salt for generating the <b>serial</b> <b>numbers,</b> and keeps it secret. The issuer increments their internal <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> and appends it to the salt, and the computed message digest is used to create the actual <b>serial</b> <b>number.</b> The issuer does have to take care to prevent collisions between existing values so as not to wrongly issue two identical <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} Nisshin Onpa (Maxon) pickups {{from the early}} 1980s that have <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> that start with a 5 and these <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> follow a reverse <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> format.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Serial</b> <b>numbers</b> {{are often}} used in network protocols. However, most {{sequence}} numbers in computer protocols are limited to a fixed number of bits, and will wrap around after a sufficiently many numbers have been allocated. Thus, recently allocated <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> may duplicate very old <b>serial</b> <b>numbers,</b> but not other recently allocated <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b> To avoid ambiguity with these non-unique numbers, [...] "Serial Number Arithmetic", defines special rules for calculations involving these kinds of <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each {{machine was}} given a <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> and user manuals were printed. At first, Thomas {{differentiated}} machines by capacity and therefore gave the same <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> to machines of different capacities. This was corrected in 1863 and each machine was given its own unique <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> starting with a <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> of 500.|$|R
50|$|The early Fender Japan E series <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> from 1984-1987 {{follow the}} Fender USA <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> format of E = eighties {{and the first}} digit of the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> {{representing}} the year.|$|R
5000|$|Furthermore, {{implementing}} <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> arithmetic using two's complement arithmetic implies <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> of a bit-length {{matching the}} machine's integer sizes; usually 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit. Implementing 20-bit <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> needs shifts (assuming 32-bit ints): ...|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} part of manufacturing, Thomas {{differentiated}} machines by capacity and therefore gave the same <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> to machines of different capacities. He corrected this in 1863, giving every machine its own unique <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> starting with a <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> of 500. This is why there isn't any machine with a <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> in between 200 and 500.|$|R
50|$|KC and KV <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> prefixes {{are usually}} used on Crafted in Korea Squiers.S/E: The S and E <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> prefix Korean Squiers {{are from the}} late 1980s/early 1990s.S = Samick, E = Young Chang, E letter <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> were used on Young Chang's Fenix brand guitars. The first <b>number</b> {{following}} the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> prefix is the year.|$|R
5000|$|Pyrometers were {{installed}} in December 1917 to accurately measure temperatures during the forging process. The change {{was made at}} approximately <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 800,000 for rifles made at Springfield Armory and at <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 285,507 at Rock Island Arsenal. Lower <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> are known as [...] "low-number" [...] M1903 rifles. Higher <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> {{are said to be}} [...] "double-heat-treated." ...|$|R
5000|$|The main flying unit {{here is the}} 3rd Infantry Battalion flying two Bell 206Bs (<b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> 4396 and 4447), two Schweizer S-300Cs (<b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> 1337 and 1339), and two Cessna U-17Bs (<b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> 1454 and 1618).|$|R
50|$|These <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> {{ignore the}} leading zeros {{at the start}} of the <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the new series, {{there are}} two codes, like in the first series. They are the printer code in the top right hand corner and the <b>serial</b> <b>number.</b> Part of the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> is {{horizontal}} {{and part of it}} is vertical. The <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> begins with a letter indicating the printer, which is broadly similar to the first series (Z for Belgium, Y for Greece, etc.). The second letter of the new <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> is part of the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> itself, and has no further significance.|$|R
2500|$|Notes of the New York FRB and the Atlanta FRB {{are the two}} keys. FRBNY {{used the}} B-L <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> block, while FRBA used a Star Note <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> block (F-*), with the {{specific}} <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> {{in place of the}} dash. While an accurate print run has never been disclosed by the BEP (as the figures were combined with the intaglio runs), estimates are 1,920,000 notes for the B-L <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> block for the FRBNY, and 640,000 for the F-* <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> block for FRBA.|$|R

50|$|The Venus has a one-letter, six-digit <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> {{printed on}} {{the neck of the}} guitar. <b>Serial</b> <b>numbers</b> {{beginning}} with the letter V were manufactured in 1997. <b>Serial</b> <b>numbers</b> beginning with the letter A were manufactured between 1997 and 1998.|$|R
50|$|The <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> {{is always}} four digits, 0-9. Leading zeros are {{included}} in the <b>serial</b> <b>number.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{check digit}} is derived by {{dividing}} the 7 digit <b>Serial</b> <b>Number</b> by 7. The remainder determines the Check Digit. Example: <b>Serial</b> <b>Number</b> 8114074 divided by 7 is 1159153 with remainder 4. Therefore the <b>Serial</b> <b>Number</b> + Check Digit is 81140744.|$|R
50|$|The table uses <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> as a {{basis for}} {{estimating}} production: Official US production bikes carry <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> in the RC340 range, California models carry RC341 numbers, Japanese models carry RC341(J) numbers, and Canadian and European models carried RC342 <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 20 July 2007 Diamond Aircraft {{announced}} the roll {{out of its}} second D-JET, <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 002. <b>Serial</b> <b>number</b> 002 is the first D-JET intended {{to conform to the}} expected production configuration in its structural layout and aerodynamic design. D-JET prototype <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 002 first flew on 14 September 2007. It was joined by D-JET <b>Serial</b> <b>Number</b> 003, which first flew on 15 April 2008.|$|R
50|$|The {{preamble}} {{portion of}} zone transfer {{relies on the}} <b>serial</b> <b>number,</b> and only the <b>serial</b> <b>number,</b> {{to determine whether a}} zone's data have changed, and thus whether the actual data transfer is required. For some DNS server packages, the <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> of SOA resource records are maintained by administrators by hand. Every edit to the database involves making two changes, one to the record being changed and the other to the zone <b>serial</b> <b>number.</b> This is a laborious process and one that is prone to error, with administrators either forgetting to change a <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> or changing a <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> incorrectly (such as decreasing it or increasing it by a huge amount).|$|R
5000|$|In 1977, Gibson {{introduced}} the <b>serial</b> <b>numbering</b> system in use until 2006. An eight-digit {{number on the}} back shows the date when the instrument was produced, where it was produced, and its order of production that day (e.g., first instrument stamped that day, second, etc.). As of 2006, the company used seven <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> systems, {{making it difficult to}} identify guitars by their <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> alone. and as of 1999 the company has used six distinct <b>serial</b> <b>numbering</b> systems. [...] An exception is the year 1994, Gibson's centennial year; many 1994 <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> start with [...] "94", followed by a six-digit production number. The Gibson website provides a book to help with <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> deciphering.|$|R
50|$|<b>Serial</b> <b>numbers</b> in the 1500s {{were built}} by Rearwin. <b>Serial</b> <b>numbers</b> in the 1600s are Commonwealth 185 Skyrangers.|$|R
50|$|Earlier {{examples}} of the Silva-Bet have <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> beginning with S, usually followed by four digits. Later models have <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> beginning with V. The <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> is marked {{near the top of}} the body just below the barrel tenon, and rarely at the bottom of the body just above the bell seam. The last two digits of the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> are stamped into the bottom of the keys.|$|R
50|$|From 1985 to 1998 {{the year}} of {{manufacture}} is the first digit of the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> + 1.For instance a <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> that is 7XXXXX = (7+1) = 8 = 1988 or 1998 and other indicators have to be used to decide whether it was made in 1988 or 1998 because there is no decade information in this <b>serial</b> <b>numbering</b> system and the <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> repeat for every decade.|$|R
50|$|Today, the Cloudboy is an {{extremely}} rare aircraft; only four Model 6 Cloudboys are still registered. Known examples include: N787H, <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 6002, owned by Ronald Alexander and displayed at the Candler Field Museum in Williamson, Georgia; N788H, <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 6003, {{on display at the}} Golden Wings Flying Museum in Blaine, Minnesota; N795H, <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 6004, on display at the Yanks Air Museum in Chino, California; N786H, <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 6010.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 244 Deauvilles were produced.There were three Deauville variants: the early series 1 (1970 - 1974: <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 10##, 11## and 12##), late series 1 (1975 - 1977: <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> 14##) and the series 2 (1978 - 1985: <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> 20## and 21##).|$|R
50|$|Early issues did {{not have}} <b>serial</b> <b>numbers,</b> and were issued without regard for inflation. Later issues did {{initially}} feature <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b> Towards {{the end of the}} war, as more money was needed to pay military personnel, notes were issued without <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> once more.|$|R
5000|$|USA-built Peavey Wolfgangs {{typically}} had <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> {{that started}} with [...] "91" [...] followed by six more digits. Late-run USA Wolfgangs had <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> {{that started with}} [...] "50" [...] or [...] "51". A very few prototype models had <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> that started with [...] "1". Though Peavey Wolfgang owners have often sought to find a corroboration in the <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> of their guitars and {{the year in which}} each was built (similar to the system Gibson uses), there was no such information contained in the <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b> There was also no code specific to Custom Shop models.|$|R
50|$|Confirmation {{is based}} on {{existing}} <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b> Many <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> still unconfirmed so actual quantity is more than recorded here.|$|R
