5|$|In 2003, the Catalan {{parliament}} {{passed a}} resolution urging development of a government plan to improve the site. A government report in 2001, re-published in 2004, included a proposal to cut down the fragile Pi Vell, leaving the stump in place along with a commemorative monument, and purchase and develop the site as a <b>public</b> <b>amenity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Having fallen {{somewhat}} into disrepair, {{the structure}} {{came under the}} care of the Banagher Branch of the Offaly Historical Society in the 1980s and considerable restoration work has been undertaken since then. The Canal Bank on which it stands, is the property of the people of Banagher and is held in trust as a <b>public</b> <b>amenity.</b> Considerable works around the castle have also taken place and the castle, park and riverside walk are open to the public.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} {{white paper}} followed the Bowes Report in February 1959, recommending that an Inland Waterways Redevelopment Advisory Committee should assist schemes to regenerate canals that {{were no longer}} able to collect enough fees from tolls to pay for their upkeep. Further reports followed, and in 1962 the Advisory Committee reported that the canal should be redeveloped, and allocated £20,000 for maintenance and £20,000 to begin restoration. The Kennet and Avon Canal Trust was formed in 1962 to restore the canal from Reading to Bristol as a through navigation and as a <b>public</b> <b>amenity.</b> It was originally a voluntary group which had previously been known as the Kennet and Avon Canal Association. The Trust gained charitable status in April and was incorporated under the Companies Act on 6 June 1962. In 1963 the newly formed British Waterways, which was created by the Transport Act of the previous year, and replaced the British Transport Commission as the statutory body for inland waterways, took over the canal and, in partnership with the Trust and riparian local authorities, restoration work began.|$|E

25|$|South Staffordshire Waterworks Co. passed {{ownership}} of the pool back to Lichfield District Council in 1968 when the water supply from Stowe Pool was no longer needed. The pool remains an important <b>public</b> <b>amenity</b> {{to the city and}} memorial gardens have been laid out {{on both sides of the}} pool. The Garden of Remembrance was laid out on the north bank in 1920 to commemorate World War I and the small memorial gardens that lie alongside Minster Walk were opened in 1955 in memory of Lichfield citizens that lost their lives in World War II.|$|E
25|$|Minster Pool is a {{reservoir}} located between Bird Street and Dam Street {{in the heart}} of the city of Lichfield, Staffordshire in the United Kingdom. The pool lies directly south of Lichfield Cathedral and historically has been important to the defence of the Cathedral Close. The pool was originally formed in the 11th century when a boggy stream was dammed at its eastern end to drive a mill on Dam Street. The pool was used as a mill pond and fishery until 1856 when the mill was demolished; it has since been retained for <b>public</b> <b>amenity.</b>|$|E

25|$|Chasewater is a {{reservoir}} {{located in the}} parish of Burntwood {{and the district of}} Lichfield in Staffordshire, England. Originally known as Norton Pool and Cannock Chase Reservoir, it was created as a canal feeder reservoir in 1797. The reservoir was created to directly supply the Wyrley and Essington Canal and maintain levels in the 160-mile Birmingham Canal Network. During a period of great industrial growth in the Black Country region the maintenance of water levels in canal infrastructure was essential and Chasewater was in great demand. As canals became less essential for transport of goods during the mid-20th century, the reservoir diversified and became a popular <b>public</b> <b>amenity</b> with activities such as water-skiing, sailing, wakeboarding and cycling. Chasewater is the third largest reservoir by volume in the county of Staffordshire and the largest canal feeder reservoir in the West Midlands.|$|E
25|$|The Friends of Windmill Gardens {{had been}} formed in April 2003 {{with the aim}} of {{restoring}} the windmill and surrounding area as a <b>public</b> <b>amenity.</b> In September 2004, an archaeological dig was organised, with assistance from the Museum of London Archaeology Service. A£25,000 grant was given by Lambeth Borough Council towards repairs to the mill and gardens. A£2,000,000 restoration plan has been put together with assistance from the Horniman Museum and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. An application for a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund was submitted. The Heritage Lottery Fund granted £397,700 towards the restoration. Lambeth Council and the Friends of Windmill Gardens also contributed towards the restoration of the mill, which cost £581,000. The restored mill was officially opened to the public on 2 May 2011 by Chuka Umunna, MP for Streatham.|$|E
25|$|The Johannesburg Planetarium was {{the first}} {{full-sized}} planetarium in Africa and the second in the Southern Hemisphere. It was originally bought by the Johannesburg municipality {{to be set up}} as part of the celebration of the city's seventieth anniversary. After acquiring an old projector from the Hamburg Planetarium, which was modernised before being shipped to South Africa, the municipality sold the projector to the university for use as both an academic facility for the instruction of students, and as a <b>public</b> <b>amenity.</b> Plans for a new building to house the projector were first drawn up in 1958, and construction began in 1959. The planetarium finally opened on 12 October 1960. The Johannesburg Planetarium is often consulted by the media, and the public, in order to explain unusual occurrences in the skies over South Africa. In 2010, the Johannesburg Planetarium celebrated its golden jubilee.|$|E

500|$|Edward VII {{developed}} the park as a <b>public</b> <b>amenity</b> by opening up {{almost all the}} previously fenced woods and making public those gates that were previously private. From 1915 level areas of the park were marked out for football and cricket pitches. A golf course was developed on the former [...] "Great Paddock" [...] of Richmond Park, an area used for feeding deer for the royal hunt. The tree belt {{in this part of}} the park was supplemented by additional planting in 1936. The golf course was opened in 1923 by Edward, Prince of Wales (who was to become King Edward VIII and, after his abdication, Duke of Windsor). The future king had been born in the park, at White Lodge, in 1894.|$|E
2500|$|Ownership {{passed to}} the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923, who had no {{interest}} in a partly moribund canal, and in 1937, they abandoned the main line. The section from Lenton to the Trent was leased to the Trent Navigation Company from 1936, and sold to them in 1946. Nottingham City Council bought the section from Lenton to the city limits and began filling it in from 1955. [...] of the upper section was bought by Broxtowe Borough Council, to retain it as a <b>public</b> <b>amenity.</b> There was a brief attempt at re-opening the upper section for navigation, but the construction of the Awsworth Bypass in 1980 severed the canal, and the plan became unworkable. Part of the upper section was subsequently destroyed by open-cast mining of coal.|$|E

2500|$|To date six {{towns and}} cities in Ireland have {{witnessed}} experienced Occupy camps; Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Letterkenny, and Athlone. Protests were held in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway. The Irish Times described the movement in the following terms: [...] "The group has no hierarchical structure, {{has set up a}} Facebook page and Twitter account – with the social media links attracting a very mixed, and sometimes critical, reaction." [...] The protest in Dublin was organized by [...] "Pots & Pans – Ireland", and #OccupyDameStreet protest group, who then invited Real Democracy Now! Shell to Sea, Tir na Saor and many other non political groups to participate and all set up camp outside the Central Bank of Ireland in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York. On 22 October it was reported that over 2,000 people took part in a demonstration organized by Occupy Dame Street. This camp survived through the winter, but was removed by an Garda Síochána (Irish police) on 13 March 2012, days before the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade. On the morning of 16 May 2012 at approximately 4:30am, the Occupy camp in Eyre Square in Galway, the longest-lasting of the Occupy groups in Ireland, was removed by An Garda Síochána and Galway City Council. The camp was removed because the group was illegally occupying a <b>public</b> <b>amenity.</b> At the time the camp was dismantled, there were only 6 protesters at the camp. The camp had lasted for 215 days.|$|E
