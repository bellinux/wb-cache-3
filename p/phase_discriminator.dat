We developed the frequency discriminator technique for the characterization of the narrow linewidth heterodyne optical beats. The examination of the four different types of the frequency and <b>phase</b> <b>discriminators</b> has identified the appropriate tools {{for the analysis of}} the low-noise signals. We made the experimental test of the β-separation line formalism that enables easy calculation of the laser linewidth from its frequency noise power spectral density (PSD). Earlier proposed geometrical approximation has been validated in a wide linewidth range and for different laser line shapes. We developed and characterized the second ultra-stable high-finesse Perot-Fabry passive reference cavity. A novel low-noise planar waveguide extended cavity laser (PW-ECL) has been stabilized to this reference cavity in a Pound-Drever-Hall stabilization scheme. A thermal model of the cavity enclosure has been made and based on that an improvement in the temperature control system was possible, resulting in the higher flexibility of the cavity temperature change. Finally, the noise properties of a novel type of the ultrafast optical frequency comb were examined. A diode-pumped solid-state laser (DPSSL) Er:Yb:glass (ERGO) frequency comb is proven to be capable of the coherent frequency division from optical to microwave, at the level of stability of 10 - 15 at 1 s.

40|$|Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) {{have been}} in the center stage of the recent {{technological}} upheaval that has been initiated by the rise of smartphones in the last decade. This is clearly reflected in the development of many applications based on GNSS technology as well as the emergence of multi-constellation GNSS with the launch of the first Galileo satellites {{at the end of the}} year 2011. GNSS does not only guarantee global positioning, navigation and timing services but also extends to applications in banking, agriculture, mapping, surveying, archaeology, seismology, commerce, ionosphere scintillation monitoring, remote sensing (soil moisture, ocean salinity, type of surface), wind speed monitoring, ocean surface monitoring, altimetry and many others. In the last decade, Location Based Services (LBS) have increased significant market demand where GNSS has been coupled with technologies based on terrestrial communication links in order to meet strict positioning accuracy requirements. In these conditions, relying on GNSS technology alone, raises a few challenges for signal synchronization even before positioning attempts and are mainly due to a considerable signal attenuation as it propagates through construction material and into indoor environments. Ionosphere scintillation induces a similar challenge where in addition to amplitude fading, the carrier phase and frequency suffer from indeterministic fluctuations. This research activity is devoted to explore and design the elements constituting pilot channel scalar tracking loop systems, specifically tailored to Galileo signals. It is expected that running such systems with extended integration intervals offers robust synchronization of the incoming signal which is heavily affected by external indeterministic fluctuations. In some conditions, it is desired to follow these fluctuations as in ionosphere scintillation monitoring while in other instances it is mainly desired to filter them out as noise to guarantee positioning capabilities. This is the objective of this research study which applies for both indoor environments and ionosphere scintillation affected signals. Towards this endeavor, a comprehensive theoretical study of the carrier and code tracking loops elements is undertaken, and particular attention is directed to the following aspects: • carrier frequency and <b>phase</b> <b>discriminators</b> and the relative optimum integration time • Galileo specific code discriminators and code tracking architecture especially tailored to Composite Binary Offset Carrier (CBOC) modulated signals. • optimum loop filters designed in the digital domain for different types of phase input signals • local signal generation using a numerically controlled oscillator and loop filter estimates • front-end filter bandlimiting effects on the tracking performance. This design is further tested with simulated Galileo signals with and without ionosphere scintillation as well as raw Galileo signals in an equatorial region during March 2013. Tracking performance comparison is carried out between the customized Galileo receiver developed in this research activity and an ionosphere scintillation dedicated professional GNSS receiver, the Septentrio PolaRxS PRO R receive...|$|R

30|$|A receiver-spoofer {{is one of}} {{the most}} covert global {{navigation}} satellite system (GNSS) spoofing attacks and can only be effectively detected by the combination of multiple anti-spoofing technologies. In this paper, an analysis of influencing parameters for receiver-spoofers indicates that the ratio of the spoofing signal amplitude versus the authentic signal amplitude (spoofing-signal ratio) is a key parameter for spoofing results. For a spoofer to ensure covertness, the goal is to maintain a low spoofing-signal ratio. The carrier phase difference and code phase difference between authentic signals and spoofing signals resulted in errors in the position estimation of the target receiver increase the lower limit of the spoofing-signal ratio required for successful spoofing. A spoofing signal alters the phase of local replicate code based on the original balance of a receiver <b>phase</b> <b>discriminator</b> to seize control. Based on this principle, the lower limit of the spoofing-signal ratio that corresponds to various <b>phase</b> <b>discriminator</b> spacings, carrier phase differences, and code phase differences is deduced in this paper. Two tests are designed for the simulation source and authentic navigation signals to verify the deduced formula. The lower limit of the spoofing-signal ratio obtained from these tests matches the calculated results, which proves the validity and effectiveness of the derived algorithm.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} a new and relatively simple algorithm which is capable to tune the parameters of the loop filter in a phase lock loop, like the one that can be found in a global navigation satellite system receiver. The parameters are chosen while the system is running, in order to make the bandwidth of the filter adaptive with respect to the signal dynamic and strength. A wider bandwidth is obtained to make the filter more reactive when searching the carrier, while the bandwidth gets narrower when the system is in the tracking state, in order to cut off as much noise as possible.

40|$|A GNSS-based {{navigation}} system relies on externally received information via a space-based Radio Frequency (RF) link. This poses susceptibility to RF Interference (RFI) and may initiate failure states ranging from degraded navigation accuracy {{to a complete}} signal loss condition. To guarantee {{the integrity of the}} received GNSS signal, the receiver should either be able to function in the presence of RFI without generating misleading information (i. e., offering a navigation solution within an accuracy limit), or the receiver must detect RFI so that some other means {{could be used as a}} countermeasure in order to ensure robust and accurate navigation. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to identify an interference occurrence and not to confuse it with other signal conditions, for example, indoor or deep urban canyon, both of which have somewhat similar impact on the navigation performance. Hence, in this paper, the objective is to investigate the effect of interference on different GNSS receiver observables in two different environments: i. an interference scenario with an inexpensive car jammer, and ii. an outdoor-indoor scenario without any intentional interference. The investigated observables include the Automatic Gain Control (AGC) measurements, the digitized IF (Intermediate Frequency) signal levels, the Delay Locked Loop and the <b>Phase</b> Locked Loop <b>discriminator</b> variances, and the Carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/N 0) measurements. The behavioral pattern of these receiver observables is perceived in these two different scenarios in order to comprehend which of those observables would be able to separate an interference situation from an indoor scenario, since in both the cases, the resulting positioning accuracy and/or availability are affected somewhat similarly. A new Running Digital Sum (RDS) -based interference detection method is also proposed herein that can be used as an alternate to AGC-based interference detection. It is shown in this paper that it is not at all wise to consider certain receiver observables for interference detection (i. e., C/N 0); rather it is beneficial to utilize certain specific observables, such as the RDS of raw digitized signal levels or the AGC-based observables that can uniquely identify a critical malicious interference occurrence...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the {{system with the}} Serially Concatenated Coded CPM (SCCCPM) and the nonlinear limiter <b>phase</b> <b>discriminator</b> receiver. We develop the FG framework allowing {{the use of the}} SPA factor node marginalization rules involving canonical distributions with finite number of parameters. We show that the straightforward application of the traditional constellation space approach is intractable. We also show that the sampled signal space does not allow an application of the parametrized canonical distributions for the variable nodes densities. The solutions we suggest in the paper stands on using the sampled parametric (phase) space of the CPM for all SPA processing. We use the idea of the component modulo mean approximation for the canonical signal phase distributions. The modulo operations are applied only on component mean values. This keeps the update rules simple by avoiding the circular distortion of the Gaussian component densities while still capturing the circular nature of the modulo operations on the signal phase.

40|$|Abstract—A {{constant}} envelope CPM {{class of}} MultiChannel (MC) modulations at multi-antenna transmitter is considered. Each receive antenna in MIMO system receives a superposition of CPM waveforms. The useful signal at the receiver spans a curved space — Information Waveform Manifold (IWM). Particularly {{it has a}} form of a cylinder on cylinder for 2 -component CPM signal. At the receiver, we use a nonlinear preprocessor consisting of nonlinear projector on the IWM, optional processing on curved space and decoding isomorphism. A particular form of the preprocessor, the 2 -component IWM <b>phase</b> <b>discriminator,</b> is analyzed. We show that the discriminator can separate individual instant phases of the component CPM modulations and therefore has multiplexing capabilities {{with respect to the}} individual transmitted components. It creates parallel eigen-space like virtual channels. No time domain processing is needed, the procedure fully relies on the curved space properties of the IWM and thus is applicable with arbitrary outer space-time coding of MC-CPM. Information theoretic analysis of the multiplexing properties based on capacity region is presented. We show that the discriminator provides good separation of component phases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Basic {{measurements}} of global navigation satellite system receivers are obtained after {{the correlation of}} the incom-ing signal with locally generated replicas. Usually, correlation intervals are chosen synchronously with the data-bits sent with each satellite signal to avoid bit transitions. As a consequence, the ensuing code and carrier phase estimation signal processing operates at its own time and the navigation task must extrapolate loop measurements to a common instant. We have proposed an alternative receiver architecture using a common correlation interval for all satellite signals. Under this scheme, the correla-tions made for each satellite in-view have a common interval, chosen in synchronism with the navigation process rather than with the data bits. Naturally, now the bit transitions within a correlation interval require special treatment. The advantages of avoiding measurement extrapolation are shown with a scalar phase lock loop structure intended for high dynamics real-time receivers. The operation of this loop in a common correlation interval receiver needs a carrier <b>phase</b> <b>discriminator</b> structure able to produce outputs for the correlation with bit transitions inside the interval. Three possible carrier discriminator schemes are analyzed in this work. It is shown that the loops operating data-bit asynchronously {{with any of these}} schemes have similar tracking threshold and phase estimation quality than those working bit-synchronously. The proposed architecture naturally generates a vector of simultaneous measurements and then it is particularly suited for the implementation of real-time vector tracking loops...|$|E
