2500|$|On May 25, 1988, Sanford M. Gage, the O'Rourke family attorney, filed a {{wrongful}} death lawsuit against Kaiser Foundation Hospital in San Diego. [...] O'Rourke {{had been seen}} by doctors at Kaiser since birth, and the suit claimed that they failed to properly diagnose her long-standing small-bowel obstruction: had they not simply treated her for Crohn's disease with prescription drugs, she {{could have had a}} <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>remission</b> by means of a major bowel surgery; and this misdiagnosis caused O'Rourke's death. [...] Kaiser Permanente spokeswoman Janice Seib responded: [...] "We have reviewed the case extensively, and we believe that the diagnosis and the course of action taken by our physicians was entirely appropriate. It's a very complex case, complicated by a number of factors, and not given to any simple answers." [...] The case went to arbitration and was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.|$|E

30|$|Bipolar I {{disorder}} (BP-I) is {{a lifelong}} neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by manic episodes, and frequently includes depressive states intermixed with <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>remission.</b> BP-I is specifically defined by <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> debilitating mania that impair social and occupational functioning and can include psychotic symptoms {{and the need for}} hospitalization (Grande et al. 2016). It has been shown that even during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>remission,</b> patients with BP-I exhibit high levels of functional and cognitive impairment, leading to a reduced quality of life (Martinez-Aran et al. 2004; Martino et al. 2009).

50|$|Crohn's {{disease is}} a chronic {{inflammation}} of the digestive track. This includes the mouth, esophagus, small intestine, large intestine, stomach, rectum and anus.

Currently, {{there is no cure}} for Crohn's disease. However, people can have a long <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>remission</b> where they are symptom free.

40|$|Wilson′s disease (WD) or hepatolenticular {{degeneration}} is {{an inherited}} neurodegenerative disorder of copper metabolism (autosomal recessive, chromosome 13).

50|$|Their idyll was {{shattered}} in 2001, when Marayat suddenly fell ill.

After a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>remission</b> that had lasted for 49 years, the disease returned and attacked her legs, causing her acute suffering and rapidly affecting her mobility. Her health further deteriorated when gangrene rapidly ensued, and both of her legs had to be amputated above the knee. She was therefore forced to spend the remaining four years of her life bedridden, being treated at home by a private nurse. Marayat Rollet-Andriane died on 12 June 2005 at Chantelouve, aged 73. Her husband Louis-Jacques Rollet-Andriane died three years later, in April 2008.

50|$|Almost all {{patients}} respond positively to antiepileptic (anticonvulsant) drugs. One {{of the drugs}} most often mentioned in the literature is carbamazepine, and is {{the most widely used}} drug for treating PKD. Other anticonvulsants like valproic acid, phenytoin and clonazepam are common alternatives. Other categories of drugs have also been used, such as dopamine affecting drugs like Levodopa or Tetrabenazine. Individuals with the disorder can also modify their behavior to lessen their attacks without the influence of drug therapy. For example, decreasing stress to avoid precipitants can help patients decrease the number of attacks. In addition, avoiding any sudden movements can also prevent an attack. In order to prevent an attack, some individuals use their auras as a warning, while others purposefully perform slow gestures or movements prior to a triggering movement. Many, if not most, individuals end up growing out of the attacks with age, even without medicinal therapy, but some patients will go back to having attacks after a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>remission.</b> In regards to secondary PKD, treatment of the primary condition can lessen the PKD attacks in those individuals.|$|E
