5|$|The <b>Pitched</b> <b>Stone</b> Court {{forms the}} {{north-east}} {{corner of the}} castle, and provided a centre for the castle services and servants; it {{takes its name from}} the late-Tudor cobbling, or <b>pitched</b> <b>stones.</b> On {{the east side of the}} court is the former office wing, a 16th-century construction mostly destroyed during the siege of 1646. The castle kitchens and pantries are on the north side, containing two large fireplaces and storage facilities for food and supplies in their cellars. In the 1460s, the first floors to these buildings included chambers for the senior servants. The buttery in the north-west corner would have been used to store and serve beer and wine.|$|R
50|$|Grandiose {{expansion}} for defence {{and comfort}} occurred between 1432 when William ap Thomas bought the manor and 1469 when his son, Sir William Herbert, was executed. Improvements by {{father and son}} included the twin-towered gatehouse, five storied Great Tower encircled by a moat, a self-contained fortress in its own right, South Gate, <b>Pitched</b> <b>Stone</b> Court, drawbridge and portcullis.|$|R

"Charles," [...] said he, {{the evening}} before his departure, as he stood close to the garden seat, on which his cousin was sitting, and amused himself with <b>pitching</b> <b>stones</b> into the river, which ran beneath the lawn at Clisson.

50|$|Tin bounds {{were created}} by the miner (or 'bounder') <b>pitching</b> <b>stones</b> or turves at {{the four corners of}} the land he {{intended}} to work. The bounder was required to declare his bounds to the Stannary Court and to renew them annually by re-pitching the stones or turves. During the early history of mining, the bounder was also required to actually work the land for tin in order for the bounds to remain valid, although this requirement was diluted over time.|$|R
50|$|The {{section of}} the Etheridge Railway over the Newcastle range and through the Delaney Gorge has more {{earthworks}} {{than the rest of}} the railway. The railway track runs along the north face of the Delaney Gorge and along the bed of the Delaney River for a short distance. The significant elements within this {{section of the}} railway include any <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> bridge piers and abutments, <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> culverts, and <b>stone</b> cuttings. A large <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> culvert is located near Native Well, east of Wirra Wirra. A bridge over Starlight Creek, just east of Delaney Gorge, has stone piers and abutments, and a small bridge just east of Wirra Wirra has stone abutments. Bridges constructed with stonework are significant due to their rarity on the Etheridge line.|$|R
5000|$|Stone Quackers {{was created}} by Ben Jones, who also created The Problem Solverz for Cartoon Network. After leaving Cartoon Network, Jones began working with Fox Broadcasting Company on their new {{animation}} block, Animation Domination High-Def. During this endeavor, Jones <b>pitched</b> <b>Stone</b> Quackers to Fox as a program for the block.In a July 2013 interview, Jones described this series a [...] "more pure, raw, uncut expression of the same artistic impulse" [...] that manifested Alfe, a character from Solverz. Jones was only allowed to describe that [...] "there will be feathers" [...] in the series.|$|R
50|$|It is {{an unusual}} {{cast-iron}} lighthouse built in 1865 to a design by John Bowen (1825-1873) of Llanelli, by the Llanelli Harbour and Burry Navigation Commissioners to mark the shoals of Whiteford Point, replacing an earlier piled structure of 1854, of which nothing remains. It is the only wave-swept cast-iron tower of this size in Britain. The tower is 44 ft high and stands just above low-water level. The base is about 24 ft in diameter and rises gracefully to a diameter of 11 ft at lantern level. A <b>pitched</b> <b>stone</b> apron surrounds {{the base of the}} lighthouse.|$|R

50|$|In the mid-fourteenth century, {{the height}} of the curtain walling at the {{south-western}} corner of the inner ward was increased, and the round tower and the inner gatehouse were also raised in height. This process is particularly noticeable because a greenish stone was used for the alterations that was significantly different in colour from the red sandstone used {{in the rest of the}} building. In the sixteenth century, the castle was remodelled into a substantial Tudor mansion with a more comfortable accommodation block and with mock battlements added to the curtain walls. Excavation has shown the remains of the Tudor cobbled courtyard, the presence of a <b>pitched</b> <b>stone</b> kitchen floor and the ground plans of the building at the different periods of its existence.|$|R
60|$|These, however, {{when the}} Spaniards advanced, gave the alarm, the watchers in the churches sounded the tocsins, and the {{sleeping}} citizens sprang from their beds, seized their arms, and ran towards the threatened point. Unawed by the overwhelming force advancing against them the sentries took their {{places at the}} top of the breach, and defended it with such desperation that they kept their assailants at bay until assistance arrived, when the struggle assumed a more equal character. The citizens defended themselves by the same means that had before proved successful, boiling oil and <b>pitch,</b> <b>stones,</b> flaming hoops, torches, and missiles of all kinds were hurled down by them upon the Spaniards, while the garrison defended the breach with sword and pike.|$|R

5000|$|The chancel was {{restored}} by John Dando Sedding in 1870. The roof was repaired in oak and raised to its old <b>pitch.</b> New <b>stone</b> coping and a cross {{were added to}} the gable. The five-light window was rebuilt copying from the original. New oak chancel seating was provided.|$|R
500|$|Sir Charles Somerset was {{politically}} successful under both Henry VII and Henry VIII, being made the Earl of Worcester. His son, Henry Somerset, died shortly after inheriting Raglan, {{but not before}} using lead reclaimed from Tintern Abbey to help the building work at Raglan Castle during {{the dissolution of the}} monasteries. His son and grandson, William Somerset and Edward Somerset, proved to be what John Kenyon describes as [...] "wealthy, brilliant and cultured men". William rebuilt much of the <b>Pitched</b> <b>Stone</b> Court, including the hall, adding the Long Gallery and developing the gardens into the new Renaissance style. The Somerset family owned two key castles in the region, Raglan and Chepstow, and these appeared to have figured prominently as important status symbols in paintings owned by the family.|$|R
50|$|An earlier <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> ramp {{remains in}} {{evidence}} {{at the side of}} the later earth-filled access to the former storage shed and wharf.|$|R
50|$|Two, {{apparently}} early, {{street lamps}} {{are located on}} the footpath {{in front of the}} shire hall. The footpath is finished with early <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> gutters.|$|R
5|$|The Fountain Court lies to {{the west}} of the <b>Pitched</b> <b>Stone</b> Court, and is named after a marble {{fountain}} that once stood in the centre of it, featuring a white horse on a black marble base, complete with a flow of running water. The fountain was probably installed somewhat after the initial construction of the court in the 1460s, dating instead to Edward Somerset in the late 16th century; the horse symbolised Edward's prestigious role as Master of the Horse. The Fountain Court was built to provide luxurious accommodation for the family and guests – by the 15th century, it was important to be able to provide private chambers for visitors, and this court could hold up to four distinct groups of visitors in comfort. The Fountain Court as a whole is marked by what Augustus Pugin described as extremely fine, elegant and delicate stonework.|$|R

Upton {{was the first}} Stone Crabs batter, but Matt Fields belted a homerun to lead off the 2nd inning, laying claim to the first Stone Crabs hit, homerun, and RBI. After {{starting}} the season 0-3, the franchise notched its first win on April 13 in Ft. Myers.|$|R

50|$|Water was {{a problem}} {{throughout}} the Croydon Goldfield and a large dam with a <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> wall was constructed in 1888, by a Mr. Shoemaker (or Schumacher). Even so the Homeward Bound battery could not crush that year.|$|R
500|$|The {{west side}} of the Fountain Court {{comprises}} the apartments, with a number of bay windows and window seats facing west and north across the park. The Grand Staircase divides the apartments; restored between 2010 and 2011, the staircase would originally have had a substantial porch, similar to the one that survives in the <b>Pitched</b> <b>Stone</b> Court, and would have been a centre-piece of the Fountain Court. Although examples of such straight-flight staircases can be found in other late-medieval buildings, the architectural historian John Newman considers the Grand Staircase had [...] "a grandeur hard to parallel in 15th century England." [...] The apartments {{to the west of the}} staircase are more complex than the others, designed to create somewhat greater privacy, and overlooked the gardens to the west of the castle. On the south side of the court is the South Gate, the original entrance to the castle prior to the 1460s reconstruction. The fan vaulted gatehouse closely resembles the contemporary cloisters at Gloucester Cathedral, but by the 16th century had been converted to the entrance to the bowling green in the terrace beyond.|$|R
50|$|The stone-pitched ford crosses Byfield Creek in a north-south {{direction}} at {{a bearing}} of 20?. It has a rectangular frame of timber sleepers fitted together and secured by bolts, presumably iron coach bolts, {{and filled with}} <b>stone</b> <b>pitching</b> to create a causeway across the creek.|$|R
25|$|For NCAA soccer games, {{a western}} section of RIMAC Field is cordoned off by {{temporary}} fences {{to create a}} regulation-sized soccer <b>pitch.</b> Permanent <b>stone</b> bleachers {{on the west side}} of the stadium allow a maximum capacity of 750, which can be expanded to 1,750 through the use of temporary bleachers for NCAA postseason fixtures. A commentary and scoring table is usually erected opposite the bleachers between the two teams' benches. The UC San Diego men's and women's soccer teams play their home games here.|$|R

Surfaces include macadamised surfacing; corduroy surfacing exists in two areas, 560 metres and 765 metres west of Devil's Elbow; <b>stone</b> <b>pitching</b> exists in a number of places, many in excellent condition.|$|R
50|$|Football hooliganism in Bangladesh {{does not}} appear to be a major problem. However, in August 2001, 100 people were injured when {{thousands}} of football fans rampaged at a B-League match between Mohammedan Sporting Club and Rahmatganj Sporting Club in the Bangabandhu National Stadium, Dhaka. When the referee disallowed a penalty, Mohammedan fans invaded the <b>pitch,</b> throwing <b>stones</b> at the police, who had to fire tear gas at the fans to try and restore order. Outside the stadium dozens of cars and buses were damaged and set on fire.|$|R
50|$|The water {{race is a}} {{rare and}} {{uncommon}} example of its type and is the longest <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> water race recorded in North Queensland. It is unusual in its size, ranging to over 2m in height in places and with a total extent of up to 10 km in length.|$|R
5|$|Raglan Castle {{was built}} in several phases, initial work {{occurring}} in the 1420s and 1430s, a major phase in the 1460s, with various alterations and additions {{at the end of}} the 16th century. The castle {{was built in}} stone, initially pale sandstone from Redbrook, and later Old Red Sandstone, with Bath Stone used for many of the detailed features. Like similar properties of the period, the castle of the 1460s was almost certainly designed to be approached and entered in a particular way, maximising the aesthetic and political value of the fortification. At Raglan, the design highlighted the Great Tower: a typical senior visitor would ride through Raglan village, and first the tower and then the rest of the castle would appear suddenly over the slight rise on the hill. A visitor would have needed to circle the Great Tower and the moat, before coming in through the gatehouse, into the <b>Pitched</b> <b>Stone</b> Court, around the edge of the communal hall, before reaching the previously hidden, and more refined, inner Fountain Court. Only then would a privileged guest be able to enter the Great Tower itself, overlooking the Herbert family's own chambers. Many less senior visitors or servants would never have entered this far, seeing only the external elements of the castle, but perhaps having been impressed by the outside of the Great Tower as they arrived.|$|R
