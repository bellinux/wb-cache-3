40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} mirtazapine-induced changes in responsive neurostimulator (RNS) recordings in a <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> epilepsy. Materials and methodsCortical detection/stimulation counts from an RNS implanted in a <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> bitemporal epilepsy were matched to mirtazapine use {{to see if}} that drug altered hippocampal excitability. ResultsMirtazapine decreased hippocampal stability; when mirtazapine was held after a washout period, DSC counts declined, but when it was retrialed, DSC counts increased. Responsive epilepsy neurostimulator system data helped design an optimal and individualized medication regimen for our <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> drug-resistant focal epilepsy. ConclusionsResponsive neurostimulator systems in epilepsy may assess a medication's effect on hippocampal excitability.
