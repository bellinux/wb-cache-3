5|$|A {{physician}} will initially assess for Parkinson's {{disease with}} a careful medical history and neurological examination. <b>People</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> given levodopa, with any resulting improvement in motor impairment helping {{to confirm the}} PD diagnosis. The finding of Lewy bodies in the midbrain on autopsy is usually considered final proof that the person had PD. The clinical course of the illness over time may reveal it is not Parkinson's disease, requiring that the clinical presentation be periodically reviewed to confirm accuracy of the diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Gastrointestinal upset {{can cause}} severe discomfort; {{it is most}} common when {{metformin}} is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1.0 to 1.7grams per day) and increasing the dose gradually but even with low doses 5% of <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> unable to tolerate metformin. Use of slow- or extended-release preparations may improve tolerability.|$|E
5|$|However, because {{intravenous}} linezolid may be {{switched to}} an oral formulation (tablets or oral solution) without jeopardizing efficacy, <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> discharged from hospital relatively early and continue treatment at home, whereas home treatment with injectable antibiotics may be impractical. Reducing {{the length of}} hospital stay reduces the overall cost of treatment, even though linezolid may have a higher acquisition cost—that is, {{it may be more}} expensive—than comparable antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|<b>People</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{released}} after assessment from hospital or emergency {{room to the}} care of a trusted person with instructions to return if they display worsening symptoms or those that might indicate an emergent condition such as: change in consciousness, convulsions, severe headache, extremity weakness, vomiting, new bleeding or deafness in either or both ears.|$|E

5|$|Symptoms of lead {{poisoning}} include nephropathy, colic-like abdominal pains, and possibly {{weakness in the}} fingers, wrists, or ankles. Small blood pressure increases, particularly in middle-aged and older <b>people,</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> apparent and can cause anemia. Several studies, mostly cross-sectional, found an association between increased lead exposure and decreased heart rate variability. In pregnant women, high levels of exposure to lead may cause miscarriage. Chronic, high-level exposure {{has been shown to}} reduce fertility in males.|$|E
5|$|People {{with cancer}} may not report pain due to costs of {{treatment}}, {{a belief that}} pain is inevitable, an aversion to treatment side effects, fear of developing addiction or tolerance, fear of distracting the doctor from treating the illness, or fear of masking a symptom that is important for monitoring progress of the illness. <b>People</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> reluctant to take adequate pain medicine because they are unaware of their prognosis, or may be unwilling to accept their diagnosis. Failure to report pain or misguided reluctance to take pain medicine can be overcome by sensitive coaching.|$|E
5|$|Many SCI {{patients}} have received misinformation {{about the effects}} of their injury on their sexual function and benefit from education about it. Although sexual education shortly after injury is known to be helpful and desired, it is frequently missing in rehabilitation settings; a common complaint from those who go through rehabilitation programs is that they offer insufficient information about sexuality. Longer-term education and counseling on sex after discharge from a hospital setting are especially important, yet sexuality {{is one of the most}} often neglected areas in long-term SCI rehabilitation, particularly for women. Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic because they feel intimidated or unequipped to handle it. Clinicians must be circumspect in bringing up sexual matters since <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> uncomfortable with or unready for the subject. Many patients wait for providers to broach the topic even if they do want the information.|$|E
