40|$|Telomeres are {{specialized}} nucleoprotein structures, which protect chromosome {{ends and}} have been implicated in the ageing process. Telomere shortening {{has been shown to}} contribute to a persistent DNA damage response (DDR) during replicative senescence, the irreversible loss of division potential of somatic cells. Similarly, <b>persistent</b> DDR <b>foci</b> can be found in stress-induced senescence, although their nature is not understood. Here we show, using immuno-fluorescent in situ hybridization and ChIP, that up to half of the DNA damage foci in stress-induced senescence are located at telomeres irrespective of telomerase activity. Moreover, live-cell imaging experiments reveal that all <b>persistent</b> <b>foci</b> are associated with telomeres. Finally, we report an age-dependent increase in frequencies of telomere-associated foci in gut and liver of mice, occurring irrespectively of telomere length. We conclude that telomeres are important targets for stress in vitro and in vivo and this has important consequences for the ageing process...|$|R
40|$|DNA damage can {{induce a}} tumor suppressive {{response}} termed cellular senescence. Damaged senescent cells permanently arrest growth, secrete inflammatory cytokines and other proteins and harbor <b>persistent</b> nuclear <b>foci</b> that contain DNA damage response (DDR) proteins. To understand how <b>persistent</b> damage <b>foci</b> differ from transient foci that mark repairable DNA lesions, we identify sequential events that differentiate transient <b>foci</b> from <b>persistent</b> <b>foci,</b> which we term ‘DNA segments with chromatin alterations reinforcing senescence’ (DNA-SCARS). Unlike transient foci, DNA-SCARS associate with PML nuclear bodies, lack the DNA repair proteins RPA and RAD 51, lack single-stranded DNA and DNA synthesis and accumulate activated {{forms of the}} DDR mediators CHK 2 and p 53. DNA-SCARS form independently of p 53, pRB and several other checkpoint and repair proteins but require p 53 and pRb to trigger the senescence growth arrest. Importantly, depletion of the DNA-SCARS-stabilizing component histone H 2 AX did not deplete 53 BP 1 from DNA-SCARS but diminished the presence of MDC 1 and activated CHK 2. Furthermore, depletion of H 2 AX reduced both the p 53 -dependent senescence growth arrest and p 53 -independent cytokine secretion. DNA-SCARS were also observed following severe damage to multiple human cell types and mouse tissues, suggesting {{that they can be}} used in combination with other markers to identify senescent cells. Thus, DNA-SCARS are dynamically formed distinct structures that functionally regulate multiple aspects of the senescent phenotype...|$|R

[...] Fletcher's definition focuses primarily on events: a play's genre is determined by whether or not people die in it, and in a secondary way on how close the action comes to a death. But, as Eugene Waith showed, the tragicomedy Fletcher developed in the next decade also had unifying stylistic features: sudden and unexpected revelations, outré plots, distant locales, and a <b>persistent</b> <b>focus</b> on elaborate, artificial rhetoric.|$|E

Both parties agreed that Foster brought a prima facie case and that the prosecutors offered race-neutral explanations for striking the black prospective jurors, the first two prongs of the three-prong test in Batson. The court examined the reasons for striking two of the black prospective jurors—Garrett and Hood—and found the reasons did not withstand scrutiny, concluding that: As we explained in Miller-El v.

5000|$|Research {{has focused}} on whether the gangs have formal structures, clear {{hierarchies}} and leadership in comparison with adult groups, and whether they are rational in pursuit of their goals, though positions on structures, hierarchies and defined roles are conflicting. Some studied street gangs involved in drug dealing - finding that their structure and behavior had a degree of organizational rationality. [...] Members saw themselves as organized criminals; gangs were formal-rational organizations, [...] Strong organizational structures, well defined roles and rules that guided members’ behavior. Also a specified and regular means of income (i.e., drugs). Padilla (1992) agreed with the two above. However some have found these to be loose rather than well-defined and lacking <b>persistent</b> <b>focus,</b> there was relatively low cohesion, few shared goals and little organizational structure. Shared norms, value and loyalties were low, structures [...] "chaotic", little role differentiation or clear distribution of labor. Similarly, {{the use of violence}} does not conform to the principles behind protection rackets, political intimidation and drug trafficking activities employed by those adult groups. In many cases gang members graduate from youth gangs to highly developed OC groups, with some already in contact with such syndicates and through this we see a greater propensity for imitation. Gangs and traditional criminal organizations cannot be universally linked (Decker, 1998), [...] however there are clear benefits to both the adult and youth organization through their association.

5000|$|Just as the Okhrana {{had once}} {{sponsored}} trade unions to divert activist energy from political causes, so too did {{the secret police}} attempt to promote the Bolshevik party, as the Bolsheviks seemed a relatively harmless alternative to more violent revolutionary groups. Indeed, to the Okhrana, Lenin seemed to actively hinder the revolutionary movement by denouncing other revolutionary groups and refusing to cooperate with them. [...] To aid the Bolsheviks {{at the expense of}} other revolutionaries, the Okhrana helped Roman Malinovsky, a police spy who had managed to rise within the group and gain Lenin’s trust, in his bid to become a Bolshevik delegate to the Duma. To this end, the Okhrana sequestered Malinovsky’s criminal record and arrested others candidates for the seat. [...] Malinovsky won the seat and led the Bolshevik delegation in the Fourth Duma until 1914, but even with the information Malinovsky and other informants provided to the Okhrana, the police were unprepared for the rise of Bolshevism in 1917. Although the secret police had agents within the Bolshevik organization, other factors contributed to the Okhrana’s inefficacy at averting the events of 1917. Among these factors was the Deputy Minister of the Interior, General V. F. Dzhunkovsky’s ban on police spies within the military, a practice he found dishonorable and damaging to morale. While, initially, the beginning of World War I moved the Okhrana’s attentions from countering revolutionaries to countering German espionage, the focus quickly shifted back as it was revealed that the Germans were heavily funding Russian revolutionary groups in order to destabilize the nation. [...] Despite the renewed attention, the February Revolution took the secret police, and the nation, by surprise. Indeed, the Okhrana’s <b>persistent</b> <b>focus</b> on revolutionary groups may have resulted in the secret police not fully appreciating the deep-seated popular unrest brewing in Russia.|$|E

While large <b>persistent</b> <b>foci</b> were predominantly formed in non-dividing cells, we observed some growing colonies that contained cells with large foci.

40|$|The {{engraftment}} of hematopoietic {{stem cells}} (HSCs) after drug resistance gene transfer and drug selection may recapitulate stress response hematopoiesis, but the processes remain elusive. Homing, trafficking, and localization of transduced cells {{and the impact}} of insertion site on focal expansion have not been well characterized. With the goal of optimizing and understanding these processes under conditions of low multiplicity of infection (MOI) lentiviral gene transfer, we used drug resistance gene O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) -P 140 K and in vivo selection to enrich for transduced and transgene-expressing HSCs. To systemically monitor homing, trafficking, and expansion after transplantation and drug selection over time, we linked MGMT-P 140 K to the firefly luciferase gene in lentiviral self-inactivating vectors. Periodic bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of transplanted recipients was followed for up to 9 months after both primary and secondary transplantation. Initial dispersion and widespread early homing and engraftment were transient, followed by detection of <b>persistent</b> and discrete <b>foci</b> at stable tissue sites after in vivo drug selection. From these studies, we concluded that drug resistance gene transfer followed by early or late drug selection can result in stable gene expression and cell expansion in <b>persistent</b> <b>foci</b> of transduced bone marrow cells that often remain in fixed sites for extended periods of time...|$|R
