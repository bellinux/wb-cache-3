40|$|The loss of colony-forming {{ability and}} the yield of DNA single strand breaks were studied {{following}} exposure of various mammalian cell types to misonidazole. A correlation was observed between cell inactivation and DNA damage. If, after exposure, {{the cells were}} washed free of the drug and then incubated at 37 degree C in growth medium, {{it was observed that}} surviving cells repaired their DNA to the point that sedimentation profiles were identical to those of unexposed cells. In nonsurviving cells, however, the DNA was found to be further degraded with <b>post-exposure</b> <b>incubation...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} cryoprotectants that {{have been shown to}} be the least toxic to {{zebrafish}} ovarian follicles (methanol and Me(2) SO), on mitochondria of stage III ovarian follicles was evaluated. The mitochondrial distributional arrangement, mitochondrial membrane potential, mtDNA copy number, ATP levels and ADP/ATP ratios were assessed following exposure to cryoprotectants for 30 min at room temperature. Results obtained by confocal microscopy showed that 30 min exposure to 2 M methanol induced a loss of membrane potential, although viability tests showed no decrease in survival even after 5 h <b>post-exposure</b> <b>incubation.</b> Higher concentrations of methanol (3 and 4 M) induced not only a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential but also the loss of mitochondrial distributional arrangement, which suggested a compromised mitochondrial function. Furthermore 3 and 4 M treatments resulted in a decrease in viability assessed by Fluorescein diacetate-Propidium iodide (FDA-PI) and in a decrease in mtDNA copy number and ADP/ATP ratio after 5 h incubation following methanol exposure, indicating a delayed effect. The use of Me(2) SO, which is considered to be a more toxic CPA to zebrafish ovarian follicles than methanol, caused a decrease in viability and a sustained decrease in ATP levels accompanied by failure to maintain mtDNA copy number within 1 h <b>post-exposure</b> <b>incubation.</b> These results indicated that even CPAs that are considered to have no toxicity as determined by Trypan blue (TB) and FDA-PI tests can have a deleterious effect on mitochondrial activity, potentially compromising oocyte growth and embryo development...|$|E
40|$|Repair process {{operating}} on radiation damaged DNA may be investigated by studying its functional integrity, e. g. {{its ability to}} serve as template for transcription. We measured the synthesis of ribosomal RNA and of the inducible enzyme arginase in yeast cells and followed their recovery after X-ray, alpha-particle and heavy ion exposure. Transcription inhibiting lesions formed upon X-irradiation in yeast cells are repaired during <b>post-exposure</b> <b>incubation</b> ("liquid-holding"). The inactivation curves are strictly exponential immediately after irradiation. After the "liquid holding" treatment the inactivation curves are still exponential but with a progressive decrease of the slopes {{as a function of}} incubation time. This indicates that a constant fraction of the lesions is repaired per time interval. But even after long incubation times (24 h) there is still a sizeable unrepaired fraction. Comparing different yeast strains and different irradiation temperatures recovery can also be demonstrated in cells exposed to alpha-particles. In addition, recovery is detected by the arginase assay after irradiation of yeast with very heavy charged particles, e. g. titanium ions...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{treatment}} of cultured human and simian cells with Cadmium (Cd), a toxic and carcinogenic metal, were first assayed on macromolecular synthesis. It was observed that DNA synthesis was inhibited by Cd concentrations considerably lower than those inhibiting protein and RNA synthesis. Because of the necessary occurrence of a DNA resynthesis step during the DNA excision repair process, {{the consequences of the}} exposure of cells to Cd were ulteriorly tested on different parameters measuring DNA repair after ultraviolet (UV) damage. UV-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) was found 2 - 3 times lower in Cd (4 X 10 (- 6) M) treated cells than in control cells for UV doses higher than 10 J/m 2. DNA breaks accumulated in UV-irradiated cells during <b>post-exposure</b> <b>incubation</b> in presence of Cd, whereas they were induced only transiently in control cells irradiated with the same dose. Cd inhibited in a concentration-dependent way the recovery of RNA transcription impaired by UV-irradiation. However, at concentrations used, Cd had no significant effects on DNA size and on rRNA synthesis in unirradiated cells. Finally, Cd was shown to inhibit the repair of potentially lethal damage during a 24 h liquid holding and to increase the toxicity of UV-irradiation. The interactions between Cd and Zinc (Zn), an essential metal for many enzymatic proteins, were also analysed. Results showed that Zn, at 5 to 10 times higher concentrations, counteracts the inhibitory effects of Cd on DNA synthesis and restores, at least partially, the repair capability of cells and their survival. The possible molecular level and mechanism of action of these metals are discussed...|$|E
