40|$|Trying to {{tell whether}} a <b>preventive</b> <b>health</b> <b>program</b> will be as effective—and cost-effective—as its proponents claim is a {{difficult}} task for policymakers and voters. This paper offers a toolkit to assist in their evaluations, {{in the form of}} eight questions to ask of any preventive health proposal. Summary Preventive health is a broad umbrella that includes such disparate services as vaccines for schoolchildren, blood pressure screenings, ad campaigns to discourage binge drinking, and special taxes on tobacco products. What all these programs have in common is an intention to spend money now in order to save money later—catching costly health problems before they arise or when they are less advanced and easier to treat. However, even the most straightforward early interventions do not always save money over the long term. Contrary to the old proverb, an ounce of prevention is not always worth a pound of cure. Something as seemingly basic as a cancer screening, if it is not narrowly targeted at high-risk patients, can fail to save money. In some cases, it can even do more harm than good.

40|$|Although medical {{surveillance}} of workers previously exposed to asbestos {{has been made}} mandatory by several laws since 1991 (recently confirmed by the law 81 / 08), neither the subject encharged of it nor the medical protocols have been yet established. In {{the absence of a}} specific regulation different medical protocols have been proposed by several centers often with no respect of ethical or radioprotectionist principles, such as some screening programs exclusively based on radiologic exams. With the aim of setting up a secondary <b>preventive</b> <b>health</b> <b>program</b> according both to a correct ethical and economic cost-effective balance, we followed up a cohort of 647 workers. The medical protocol included a physical exam, functional respiratory tests, thoracic Xray and low dose CT scans along with some experimental biologic markers such as mesothelin and osteopontin. All the mentioned tests were periodically administered to asbestos workers according to the individual level of risk. This risk-modulated preventive medical protocol allowed us to diagnose respiratory diseases in up to 39 % of the investigated population, 2 / 3 of which were classified as asbestos-related occupational diseases. In conclusion our data suggest that the integration of different kind of exams, with limited use of radiology, is effective in the medical follow-up of asbestos-exposed workers. Regional health politics should begin to take into account this reported evidence...|$|E

One of the oldest and largest <b>preventive</b> <b>health</b> <b>programs</b> for the elderly in the United States, the California <b>Preventive</b> <b>Health</b> Care for the Aging Program (PHCAP) is analyzed. The typical PHCAP participant was white, female, between 70 and 79 years of age, and living in an urban area. More than half (59 percent) of the PHCAP participants had some kind of private medical insurance in addition to Medicare coverage. Seventy-seven percent of the participants had seen a physician within the previous year. The most frequently reported chronic conditions were arthritis (31 percent), hypertension (24 percent), cardiovascular problems (13 percent), and vision and hearing problems (18 and 11 percent). Twenty-seven percent of the population were hypertensive; 7 percent of these had moderate to severe hypertension.

In {{the context of a}} new adolescent <b>preventive</b> <b>health</b> <b>program</b> in a family practice setting, we compared attendance rates using two invitation protocols, the protocols differing in their emphasis on adolescent autonomy vs parental responsibility. Methods: One hundred six teenagers in the seventh and tenth grades were invited for preventive health visits with the family nurse and physician using two protocols. Protocol 1 involved obtaining pa-rental consent before approaching the adolescent. With protocol 2, an invitation letter and parental consent form were mailed to the teenager, while a letter of explanation was sent concurrently to the parents. In each case, the letter of invitation was followed up by a telephone call for those who did not respond. The spontaneous response rate (a positive response after receiving the letter), agreement to attend rate (a positive response after receiving the letter or being telephoned), and the attendance rate were determined according to grade, sex, and protocol. Results: The spontaneous response rate was 21 %, the agreement to attend rate was 75 %, and the attendance rate was 44 %.

A Community-Oriented Primary Care (COPC) program targeted all adolescent patients aged 12 — 18 years in two Israeli family practices. 321 teenagers were invited to participate. Every 7 th and 10 th grader was invited for a preventive health visit with the family physician and nurse. The visits included a medical evaluation, screening and counseling regarding health issues recommended by GAPS, and counseling regarding personal health concerns. Parents were also invited to meet with the staff. 184 (57 %) of the adolescents invited for health visits attended. The overall visit time was 47 minutes, including 12 minutes for a questionnaire and 35 minutes with providers. Common biomedical problems included overweight, acne and dysmenorrhea. Health risk behaviors and psychosocial problems included cigarette or alcohol use, dieting, infrequent/never seat belt use, and feeling depressed. 78 % wanted to discuss at least one personal health issue. 27 % were invited for follow-up visits.

We accessed and analyzed data of 6682 volunteer participants with repeated observations on serum 25 (OH) D concentrations and metabolic syndrome. We applied logistic regression to quantify the independent contribution of baseline serum 25 (OH) D and temporal increases in serum 25 (OH) D to the development of metabolic syndrome. In the first year in the program, participants, on average, increased their serum 25 (OH) D concentrations by 37 nmol/L.

40|$|The Canadian incarceration rate of 116 per 100, 000 peoplereveals a {{relatively}} high rate of incarceration compared toWestern European countries. 1 Although the absolute number of Canadians with incarceration experience is relatively small, they experience many health inequities and {{are among the most}} underserved populations in Canada. 2 - 5 Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that the determinants of criminality and recidivism are similar to the determinants of health. For example, criminal behaviour patterns are associated with substance dependence which is often an expression of trauma and unmet health and social needs, including inaccessible health care services. 6 Imprisonment itself also negatively impacts health for several reasons, including separation from family, unhygienic facilities, and poor self-care as a reaction to imprisonment. 7 Self-reported health problems are also found to increase with inmates’ duration of incarceration. 8 Upon release from prison, individuals face many challenges to reintegration, including social exclusion, which is often underpinned by the stigma of incarceration. 5, 9, 10 Although health-seeking behaviours of prisoners can improve when appropriate prison health services are provided, barriers persist to accessing health services in the community. 11 As health care provision often focuses finite resources on the most pressing health needs, individuals with incarceration experience in particular have little access to <b>preventive</b> <b>health</b> <b>programs.</b> Indeed, the authors of the current article were unable to locate any Canadian-based <b>preventive</b> <b>health</b> promotion <b>programs</b> targeted to individuals with incarceration experience living in the community...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} success of preventive health programs is typically {{assessed by the}} net health-related utility gain or loss to society relative to the cost. Issues relating to {{the positive or negative}} utility associated with participating in a <b>preventive</b> <b>health</b> <b>program</b> are often ignored. However, it is likely that calls for informed consumer choice and respect for patient autonomy will provide an impetus to examine utility associated with the process and outcomes of preventive health programs. In this paper, we outline the nature of the ex ante and ex post perspective in evaluing benefits and the presence of process utility and the utility of gambling in individual's utility function for preventive health care. The implications of including process attributes and psychological states when assessing benefits to society are discussed in relation to an empirical study on the value of external hip protectors for the prevention of hip fractures. We demonstrate that wearing hip protectors and the psychological outcomes of being a participant in the program can {{have a significant impact on}} individual's assessment of the benefits. Furthermore, point of reference plays a crucial role in their valuation. Individuals who did not consent to participate in a trial of hip protectors valued all states significantly lower than those who did participate in the trial. We argue that the utility associated with adherence to the intervention is an important issue for preventive health policy. From the viewpoint of applied welfare economics, evaluation of preventive health programs should allow for both process and outcome utility when assessing benefits. In this context, success might be viewed as maximising the opportunity for individuals to make an informed choice.

In the present study we examined whether temporal improvements in vitamin D status, measured as serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH) D], reduce the risk of insulin resistance among individuals without T 2 D. We accessed and analyzed data from 5730 nondiabetic participants with repeated measures of serum 25 (OH) D who enrolled in a <b>preventive</b> <b>health</b> <b>program.</b> We used the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and applied logistic regression to quantify the independent contribution of baseline serum 25 (OH) D and temporal increases in 25 (OH) D on HOMA-IR.

It is anticipated {{that in the future}} an unspecified amount from the increased tax on ‘alcopops’ will be allocated to <b>preventive</b> <b>health</b> <b>programs.</b> This spending is offset by savings of 2. 608 billion/ 5 years. Total Commonwealth Government spending in health is 46. 03 billion in 2008 - 09 or 241 billion / 5 years, averaging around 15. 7 percent of total budget spending. The budget papers predict that expenses related to health are likely to be a major contributor to the growth in Commonwealth Government spending in future decades. Total expenses for health is estimated to increase by 5. 2...|$|R
40|$|Production {{function}} {{studies have}} mainly been {{directed at the}} formal health care sector, in particular hospitals. Health production function relating medical and/or non-medical health inputs to good health, however, have not been intensively investigated. This paper explores the possibility of employing a health production function {{to examine the relationship}} between <b>preventive</b> <b>health</b> <b>programs</b> and <b>health</b> status. A review of previous empirical works is presented. When morbidity or mortality is used as a,measure of health status, a modification of the usual production function is needed as morbidity or mortality is expected to decline when health input increase. This paper examines six possible function forms, i. e. linear, quadratic, log-linear, reciprocal log-linear, and double log. The paper also considers the use of a health production function to construct isoquants for health status and to estimate the elasticity of production and the elasticity of substitution between health inputs. Some empirical results on the production relationship between morbidity, safe water, and sanitation are presented...|$|R

In 2008, the Africa Mercy continued its service to Liberia—offering free surgeries, assistance in healthcare infrastructure development, and community-based <b>preventive</b> <b>health</b> care <b>programs</b> that benefited thousands {{of individuals and}} many communities. More than 1,200 surgical procedures and 10,000 dental procedures were completed, along with community health projects such as HIV/AIDS prevention and construction of wells and latrines.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} part of the planning process for helminth-associated disease control is the accurate assessment of the current levels of morbidity that are caused by these chronic parasitic infections (Table 1). At the same time, we need a valid estimate of the improvements that are to be expected when anti-parasite drug treatment is implemented and other measures are put into action for transmission control. We want to know how these interventions can affect overall patient health, and how helminth control programs can mesh with the objectives of other curative and <b>preventive</b> <b>health</b> <b>programs.</b> To do this, it is important to use health measurements (metrics) that can be standardized among the various diseases that are to be considered. By use of common metrics, disease impact and program outcomes can be more fairly compared, and planning and policy decisions can be based on a more level assessment of multiple control strategies [1]. The challenge Historically, the disabling impact of chronic disease due to infection with RNAS+ parasites has not been well addressed [2, 3]. Fortunately, this is changing as ne...|$|R
40|$|The Indian Health Service (IHS) was {{transferred}} from the Department of Interior to the Public Health Service in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1955. At that time, the general health of Indian people substantially lagged behind {{the rest of the}} U. S. population. This gap was reflected in mortality rates which were several-fold higher for Indians, or reflected in time; there were decades between the dates when the U. S. population achieved certain lower death rates compared with the dates when similar reductions were achieved by Indians. As a result of <b>preventive</b> <b>health</b> <b>programs,</b> improvements in sanitation, {{and the development of a}} number of medical advances, substantial progress has been achieved in improving the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives. Life expectancy of Indians has increased 20 years between 1940 and 1980. From 1955 through 1982, the death rate for Indian infants dropped by 82 percent. Also, the age-adjusted death rate for tuberculosis decreased from 57. 9 per 100, 000 population in 1955 to 3. 3 in 1983. These and other improvements are summarized in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Pre-exposure {{prophylaxis}} (PrEP) is {{a potent}} and underutilized HIV prevention tool. In this paper we review the state of knowledge regarding PrEP implementation for {{men who have sex}} with men and transgender persons in early adopting countries. We focus on implementation of PrEP in demonstration projects and clinical care, and describe the status of PrEP availability and uptake. We report on approaches to identifying appropriate PrEP candidates in real-world settings and on best practices for clinical monitoring. This includes the exclusion of undiagnosed HIV infection prior to PrEP initiation and longitudinal measurement of renal function, in light of safety data. Since adherence is the primary factor moderating the effectiveness of PrEP, we discuss effective adherence support interventions. Additionally, we review the evidence for risk compensation with PrEP use and opportunities to provide PrEP as part of comprehensive and inclusive <b>preventive</b> <b>health</b> <b>programs.</b> We summarize cost-effectiveness studies, including their variable conclusions because of differing underlying assumptions, and discuss the importance of budgetary impact for public <b>health</b> <b>programs</b> and <b>health</b> care insurers. Further, we emphasize a need for greater engagement of health care providers in PrEP to increase access. We conclude with recommendations for ways to improve future efforts at implementing PrE...|$|R

40|$|A lot of {{work and}} care is {{required}} to develop newborn calves into productive, lactating cows. When managed properly, replacement heifers should grow {{at a rate that}} allows them to calve at 24 months of age or less. However, a recent report indicated that the average age of Holsteins at first calving was 26. 9 months (Hare et al., 2006), so there are opportunities for improvement. Also, the mortality rate on many farms is higher than desired reducing the number of potential replacement heifers. Much of the success, or failure, of the replacement heifer program is related to care provided during the first two months of life. “Thirty-one percent of all dairy heifer mortality during the first 21 days could be prevented with improved colostrum management ” (Dr. Sandra Godden, Univ. of Minn.). Providing a clean calving environment and timely feeding of good colostrum is essential for getting calves off to a good start. After weaning, providing balanced diets along with adoption of good <b>preventive</b> <b>health</b> <b>programs</b> will ensure that calves are ready to breed by 13 months of age so they can calve at 24 months of age or less and produce up to their potential.

40|$|Abstract Water has {{meaning for}} health, illness and wellbeing. Central themes of meaning can be {{identified}} consistently throughout history, sometimes easily discernible, while at other times more difficult to identify. These meanings have a substantial social dimension, and reflect physical and bodily interactions with water. This article considers how these aspects of water have caused specific meanings of water to be prioritized by the medical world {{and the general public}} throughout history. It focuses on different medical and everyday settings such as traditional forms of medicine, therapeutic and curative practices in seaside sanatoria and spas, and public health initiatives. Different meanings of water can still be identified in contemporary health, where they are used to encapsulate and express an extraordinary range of experiences, meanings and values about health, illness and wellbeing. These meanings of water are related to {{the emergence of a new}} health consciousness in which responsibility for health has shifted from society to the individual. Water’s meanings reflect tensions that arise from <b>preventive</b> <b>health</b> <b>programs</b> and the <b>health</b> industry, and provide avenues for expressing social identity for various groups within Western cultures...|$|R

The study participants were found to have a good knowledge of diabetes. They know that a sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy diet are among the risk factors for diabetes, and they also know that physical activity and the consumption of a healthy diet can prevent the acquisition of diabetes. Regardless of their knowledge, participants reported a sedentary lifestyle accompanied with the consumption of an unhealthy diet. This was attributed to a lack of access to tailored physical activity services and poor access to health information. The participants pointed out that gender-exclusive physical activity facilities and information provided to them in their own language may help alleviate women’s barriers to a healthy lifestyle. Considering gender-exclusive training facilities for Somali immigrant women and others with similar needs, in addition to access to tailored health information on diet, may encourage Somali women to adopt a healthy lifestyle, and it will definitely contribute to a national strategy for the prevention of diabetes...|$|R
