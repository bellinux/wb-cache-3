5000|$|In crude {{olive oil}} production, the {{traditional}} system, i.e. pressing, and the three-phase system produce a press cake and {{a considerable amount}} of waste water while the two-phase system, which is mainly used in Spain, produces a <b>paste-like</b> <b>waste</b> called [...] "alperujo" [...] or [...] "two-phase pomace" [...] that has a higher water content and is more difficult to treat than traditional solid waste. The water content of the press cake, composed of crude olive cake, pomace and husk, is about 30 percent if it is produced by traditional pressing technology and about 45-50 percent using decanter centrifuges. The press cake still has some oil that is normally recovered in a separate installation. The exhausted olive cake is incinerated or used as a soil conditioner in olive groves.|$|E

To evaluate this potential, coatings were prepared from BC extracts and their surface behavior was evaluated by contact angle (CA) measurements. The CA dynamics were recorded as a function of time; advancing CAs were also registered; the approaches were applied according to Fowkes, Owens- Wendt-Rabel-Kaelble (OWRK), and Van Oss to determine the surface energy (SE) for each coating. Depending on the liquid probe, three phenomena were observed: water evaporation, diiodomethane diffusion into the coating, and rearrangement of the chemical groups on the coating surface, when glycerol was dropped onto the surface. Based on the results from the CA dynamics, the applicability of the coatings against hydrophobic environments was limited owing to its affinity to apolar compounds. The results show that the coating prepared by the toluene BC extract was the best coating. The key data were: water CA of 99. 38, total SE (between 37. 4 mN m- 1 and 40. 1 mN m- 1), SE polar component (0. 1 mN m- 1), and the acidic and basic characters were negligible. It can be concluded that the BC extracts have potential for coatings. R. P. acknowledges a post-doc research grant BPD/ 39333 / 2007 from the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT).
