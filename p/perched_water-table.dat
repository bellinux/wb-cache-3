40|$|Since the Aberfan {{colliery}} {{spoil heap}} disaster the National Coal Board has sponsored a research programme on existing British spoil heaps. This thesis {{is part of}} that programme and considers an unburnt, unwashed, conical spoil heap at Littleton Colliery, Staffordshire. Tipping took place from about 1900 to about 1940 and records relating to discard constituents are very sparse. A slope failure in 1970 instigated this research project which is aimed at elucidating the compositional and shear strength characteristics affecting the stability of spoils in the Littleton area. Mineralogical, chemical and shear strength analyses were carried out on samples from the spoil heap and contributing underground measures. The absence of an underground measure from the original list of contributors was detected during the mineralogical and chemical analyses. This measure was identified, showing the value of such analyses in clarifying the history of such ancient tips. Mineralogy was found to correlate well with the chemical analyses of the samples, and the analyses of the spoil heap materials correlated well with those of the underground materials. No evidence of leaching or weathering was found in the tip. The shear strengths of the materials tested correlated well with the mineralogical and chemical analyses, the unusually low shear strengths of Littleton Spoil Heap No. 1 being reflected by high clay mineral contents. The slope stability problems occurring in the spoil heap are believed {{to be related to the}} Maclane Tippler method of spoil placement which has resulted in the spoil heap material approaching or achieving residual shear strength. A <b>perched</b> <b>water-table</b> within the spoil heap has initiated instability, giving rise to a deep-seated, circular slip...|$|E
40|$|Lake {{water levels}} are {{sensitive}} sentinels {{of changes in}} the climate and landscape of the broader lake catchment. This means that lakes can be useful for quantifying the effects of these changes on the water yield of a catchment. This study presents a water balance model of a closed catchment-lake system in the semi-arid Mediterranean climate over the last 85 years, with the objective to understand the influence of precipitation change and the conversion from Mediterranean maquis to pasture. Deforestation alters the balance between evapotranspiration and canopy interception, and causes the rapid decay of soil hydrological properties, thus changing the mechanisms of runoff generation. The overall impact of these changes on the water yield has been evaluated for the catchment of the lake. A physically based rainfall–runoff model, combined with the energy budget method for estimating lake evaporation, were used for the lake water balance model. The calibration was carried out with the continuous measurements taken during the period 2008 – 2013. The reliability was evaluated with the historical lake levels between 1929 and 2008. Simulation errors were small despite the high sensitivity of the water balance model to precipitation, which in the historical period was that of a non-local station. The simulation results show that the balance was influenced by a combination of climate and land-use changes. The 23 % decrease in precipitation observed in the last 50 -years has resulted in a 72 % decrease in average streamflow. The contemporaneous deforestation in 18 % of the catchment area resulted in a 13 % decrease in streamflow. The main mechanism of runoff generation under the maquis cover was saturated subsurface-flow. At hillslope scale this can eliminate the surface runoff, giving the impression that the water yield is lower than that of deforested hillslopes. However, at the basin scale the effect can also be reversed. The reduction in soil hydraulic conductivity and porosity in deforested and altered soils produces higher soil moisture and <b>perched</b> <b>water-table,</b> which means that there are higher evaporation and percolation losses. As simulated by the hydrological model, these higher losses compensate for the greater throughfall. Thus deforestation gives rise to lower water yield in this semi-arid Mediterranean environment...|$|E
40|$|A {{combined}} recording tensiometric, hydrometric, {{chemical and}} stable isotope tracing approach {{was used to}} identify the age, origin and pathways of subsurface stormflow in a small (3. 8 ha) catchment in the Tawhai State Forest, Westland, New Zealand. Eleven storm runoff events were intensively monitored during the August to December 1987 study period. Of the 7 events suitable for isotopic mass balance hydrograph separation, the volume fraction of groundwater, or pre-event water, averaged 10 % of stormflow volumes. New water contribution could {{be accounted for by}} saturation overland flow and headwater subsurface flow. Hillslope flow was dominated by old water contributions of between 70 and 100 %, which increased downslope. Within storm deuterium variations in rainfall were high (4. 4 to 93. 5 %/oo), reflecting changes in air mass trajectory and rainfall intensity. Soil water and groundwater deuterium concentrations showed a dampened response to rainfall input, and mean residence time varied from approximately 12 to 100 days, depending on soil depth, slope position and distance downslope. Soil physics analyses were conducted in valley-bottom nearstream, midslope hollow and upslope hollow locations. Tensiometric results showed that the unsaturated zone overlying near-stream groundwater was rapidly changed to positive matric potential due to the limited storage characteristics of the local soils. This response produced an early and steady increase in old water exfiltration into the stream channel as a groundwater ridge developed along the channel margin. As rainfall depth increased above approximately 10 mm, contributions from mid-slope and upslope hollows dominated channel stormflow, and most of the subsurface water was delivered to first order channels via continuous pipes occurring at the mineral soil-bedrock interface. Limited storage effects augmented the development of a <b>perched</b> <b>water-table</b> in the mid-slope hollow, which was quickly dissipated by lateral pipeflow. Bypass flow down cracks was observed during some events with high (8 to 14 mm hr⁻¹) short-term rainfall intensity bursts. The relatively low frequency of high hourly rainfall intensities, however, ensures that bypassing is not a regular occurrence in the M 8 catchment. Results from ten hillslope water injection experiments in various slope positions showed that input water isotopic signatures attained an old water status very quickly, due to mixing with a near-saturated soil matrix along crack and pipe walls. The major implications of this work are twofold: (i) it has demonstrated that stream-based isotopic and chemical tracing can be reconciled with hillslope-oriented hydrometric work, and (ii) it has revealed some of the important runoff processes that link the idea of macropore flow with the notion of old water displacement, and which satisfies information on soil water physics and water isotopic concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Streams {{draining}} coniferous {{forests are}} often loaded with solutes such as hydrogen ion, sulphate, nitrate and aluminium. As a result, fish populations {{can be reduced}} and water quality may fall below recommended potable standards. The transport of ions into water-courses is governed by the movement of water. Within most temperate and tropical areas the stream discharge and chemistry, during periods of rapid runoff, {{is dominated by the}} exfiltration of water and solutes from stream-side soils. The movement of water to stream-side or ‘riparian’ areas remains, however, an enigma. This paper attempts to explain how the riparian area might be rapidly recharged during storm events. Two analytical techniques, the free-surface method and tangent-continuity method, are applied to hydrological properties monitored on a steep coniferous hillslope, during a selected storm event. Comparison of the ionic concentrations of waters within each component of the hydrological system, is used to verify the hydrological analysis. <b>Perched</b> <b>water-tables</b> developed within the basal zones of the O/Ah and Eag soil horizons of the steep podzolic hillslope, during all major storm events. Most of the rapid response within the riparian zone could be explained by lateral flow in these near-surface soil horizons, particularly in the saturated basal zones. This pathway is corroborated by the similarity of riparian zone and near-surface (or topsoil) chemistries. Relatively low concentrations of monomeric aluminium and relatively high concentrations of chloride, sodium and hydrogen ion were observed within these zones, compared with the subsoil (Bsl and B/C) horizons...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} {{contains many}} examples, which demonstrates {{the importance of}} climatic conditions, particularly of rainfall but also temperature, on landslide activation. Normally landslides occur during specific hydrologic conditions; {{the relative importance of}} each factor will however vary with the landslide type. Heavy rains are one of the main natural factors producing landslides as they may cause pore pressure to increase on slopes or can create adverse seepage conditions, modify the slope's geometry as a result of erosion and originate swelling and softening processes in clay soils. According to their different behaviour, it is necessary to distinguish shallow or deep-seated landslides, first-time or reactivated landslides, the nature of landslide body (terrain or rock) as well as the hydrogeological nature of soils. Shallow landslides in soils and weathered rocks are often generated on steep slopes during the most intense part of a storm (lasting from minutes to several hours). The higher permeability of the outermost portion of the slope, compared to the bedrock below, allows {{for the creation of a}} temporary <b>perched</b> <b>water-table,</b> inducing the progressive increase of pore-water pressure. On the other hand, deep-seated landslides can be mobilised as a consequence of moderate intensity rainfalls lasting several days, owing to the longer recharging time required for ground-water level to rise and cause a significant build up in pore-water pressure. Pioneer studies, concerning landslides triggered by rainfalls, go back to ' 30 s. Were selected 138 papers and key information was collected in a database. Nearly 82 % of all records are local investigations carried out in 23 countries. Italy provides the largest sample as for author’s nationality and widespread proneness to landslides; followed by United States (15 %), Hong Kong (8 %), Japan and United Kingdom. Two main approaches have been used to investigate rainfall-induced landslides: -empirical or semi-empirical relationships, using statistical correlation and forecasting techniques; -deterministic modelling of groundwater recharge and pore-water pressure changes. Studies concerning the first type of approach have reached interesting results about combination of antecedent rainfall and rainstorms intensity able to trigger widespread soilslip activation in specific geological, morphological and climatic settings. Relationships between rainfall intensities and duration associated with shallow landslides and debris flows activation has also been found and they are often used for warning purposes. For the activation of widespread mass movements, some authors underline the role of an effective rainfall period ended by a pronounced increased of rainfall intensity; in this situations hazard precursors may be considered as a combination of cumulate rainfall and rainfall intensity. The second approach requires the development of a clear picture of the modes of water flow on and below the ground surface: where groundwater flow is concerned, attention is focused on both the saturated and the unsaturated zones and complete hydrological models of slopes must be defined. The present paper is a critical overview of recent international research activity on this subject. Methods and experiences are compared and classified. Some author's direct experiences are utilised for these purposes...|$|E
