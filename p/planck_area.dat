40|$|Asking very {{elementary}} relativistic {{quantum mechanics}} to meet quantum of area and time, {{it is possible}} to derive at a general level: a) the seesaw bound for the mass of neutrinos, and b) the need of a gauge group at energies below Planck mass. Having the seesaw mechanism as an explicit realization, a general lower bound on the mass of neutrinos has been traditionally derived from Planck mass (see e. g. R. E. Schrock mini-review on neutrinos for [2]) so that mν ≈ am 2 ew / ¯ MP, with mew the electroweak scale, ¯ MP a generic new physics scale whose maximum value is Planck mass, and a a dimensionless constant, probably a Yukawian coupling. Now it is obvious that any argument asking an electroweak force GFm 2 ν to be of order amν / ¯ MP will serve to obtain this bound. The later quotient can be argued as a quotient of energies or as a quotient of wavelengths. It seems interesting to remark that we can derive this condition from the existence of a quantum of area, asking that the measurement of area swept by any orbiting particle must be at least such quantum and assuming this quantum to be directly related to <b>Planck’s</b> <b>area.</b> The example reshapes in some way our view of symmetry breaking at the Planck scale, as it happens that below this mass scale gravity becomes too weak to be able to sustain this quantum {{and it needs to be}} supplemented by other forces: electromagnetism, strong or electroweak forces. In the case of neutrinos only electroweak interaction is available, and this imposes a bound to neutrino mass. Lets think first a classical, non relativistic case. For a force field F = −K/r 2 a circular orbit at radius r will have an angular speed ω such that K/r 2 = mrω 2, and thus it will orbit a length δl = rωδt in a time δt and to sweep an area δA = 1 2 r 2 ωδt. The angular momentum of the particle is L = mrv = mr 2 ω. You can notice that K = vL, but we do not use this property in the inequalities.
