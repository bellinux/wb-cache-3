40|$|BACKGROUND When a {{customer}} delivers a <b>colour</b> <b>proof</b> to a printer, {{they expect the}} final print to look similar to that proof. Today {{it is impossible to}} control if a match between proof and print is technically possible to reach at all. This is mainly {{due to the fact that}} no information regarding the production circumstances of the proof is provided, for instance the printer does not know which proofer, RIP or ICC-profile that was used. Situations where similarity between proof and print cannot be reached and the press has to be stopped are both costly and time consuming and are therefore wished to be avoided. PURPOSE The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the possibility to form a method with the ability control if a proof is of such good quality that it is likely to produce a print that is similar to it. METHOD The basic assumption was that the quality of a proof could be decided by spectrally measuring known colour patches and compare those values to reference values representing the same patches printed at optimal press conditions. To decide which and how many patches that are required, literature and reports were studied, then a test printing and a comparison between proofing systems were performed. To be able to analyse the measurement data in an effective way a tool that analyses the difference between reference and measurement data was developed using MATLAB. RESULT The result was a suggestion for a <b>colour</b> <b>proof</b> quality verification method that consists two parts that are supposed to complement each other. The first one was called <b>Colour</b> <b>proofing</b> system evaluation and is supposed to evaluate entire proofing systems. It consists of a test page containing colour patches, grey balance fields, gradations and photographs. The second part is called <b>Colour</b> <b>proof</b> control and consists of a smaller set of colour patches that is supposed to be attached to each proof. CONCLUSIONS The method is not complete since more research regarding the difference between measurement results and visual impression is needed. To be able to obtain realistic tolerance levels for differences between measurement- and reference data, the method must be tested in every-day production. If this is done the method is thought to provide a good way of controlling the quality of <b>colour</b> <b>proofs...</b>|$|R

The aim of this work was to use an electrochemical procedure to treat used dyebaths and cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique for dye degradation study. Electrolysis can be an adequate process for colour removal as well organics pollutants and CV is an important tool for redox reactions interpretation. Electrochemical treatment results show significant decrease on COD values, for the different values of dye concentration and several applied potentials. <b>Progressive</b> <b>colour</b> removal and dye degradation can be achieved for different values of dye concentration.

Empirical approaches to characterise these currently use cumbersome experimental systems; hence {{the need to develop}} a high throughput research tool, analogous to the techniques used in high throughput pharmaceutical research. In this study, a microwell research tool was evaluated as a growth and measurement tool for mixed autotrophic bioleaching cultures. The tool was assessed by comparing its performance to conventional shake flask apparatus. Mixed mesophilic cultures of predominantly Leptospirillum ferriphilum and Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans were used. Growth and ferrous iron oxidation kinetics were quantified and assessed. Microwell plates performed similarly to conventional shake flasks with respect to growth and iron oxidation kinetics. The microwell plate apparatus was also used as a measurement system in combination with a microwell plate reader (measuring absorbance change at 428 nm over time). <b>Progressive</b> <b>colour</b> change of growth experiments correlated to ferrous iron oxidation within a defined operating window. We conclude that, using this measurement as a proxy for trends iron oxidation, the microwell research tool is well-suited for high throughput scoping studies to map operating windows for different cultures, in both an unadapted and adapted context. This was confirmed through an activity test utilising fluoride as an inhibitor.

Some of these reprints are quite scarce, particularly the Perlis 10 cents and Sabah 20 cents values, as they were replaced by the new issue of Flowers and Animals the same year, and the new issue had not been announced by the post office. Once again, the stamps were printed in sheets of 200 in two panes of 100, 10 x 10. Unlike the Bradbury Wilkinson printings, these sheets had cylinder numbers in the bottom right margins, one for each colour and numbered 1A for the left pane and 1B for the right.These stamps can easily be separated out from the Bradbury Wilkinson printings, as photogravure produces edges with a 'fuzzy' look, caused by the photographic process when producing the printing cylinders.

Proofs of the key block were coloured by the illustrator; Evans would then [...] "determine the sequencing and register...to arrive at a close reproduction of the artist's original". Blocks were painted and engraved; one for each <b>colour.</b> A <b>proof</b> of each <b>colour</b> block was made before a final proof from the key block. [...] Ideally, the proof would be a faithful reproduction of the original drawing, but Evans believed a print was never {{as good as a}} drawing. He took care to grind and mix his inks so they closely emulated the original. Finally, each block was placed so as to allow the individual colours to print on the page exactly as intended. Aware of costs and printing efficiencies, he used as few colours as possible. Illustrations were produced with a base of black, along with one or two colours and a flesh tone for faces and hands. In some cases, Evans may have used as few as four colour blocks: likely black, flesh and two primary colours; the addition of yellow allowed him a greater range. Each colour was printed from a separately engraved block; there were often between five or ten blocks. The chief problem was to maintain correct register, achieved by placing small holes in precise positions on each block to which the paper was pinned. If done correctly, the register of colours match, although sometimes ink squash is visible along the edges of an illustration.|$|R
