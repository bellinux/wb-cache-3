5|$|The final {{project for}} his great patron Eusebi Güell was {{the church for}} the Colònia Güell, an {{industrial}} village in Santa Coloma de Cervelló (1890–1918). The project began in 1890, and the factory, service buildings and housing for the workers were constructed. What {{would have been the}} colony's church was designed by Gaudí in 1898, though the first stone was not laid until 4 October 1908. Unfortunately only the crypt (known today as Crypt of the Colònia Güell) was built, as Güell's sons abandoned the project after his death in 1918. Gaudí designed an oval church with five aisles, one central aisle and two at either side. He conceived it as fully integrated into nature. A porch of hyperbolic <b>paraboloid</b> vaults precedes the crypt, the first time that Gaudí used this structure and notably the first use of <b>paraboloid</b> vaults in the history of architecture. In the crypt the large hyperboloid stained glass windows stand out, with the shapes of flower petals and butterfly wings. Inside, circular brick pillars alternate with slanted basalt columns from Castellfollit de la Roca.|$|E
5|$|In 1892 Gaudí was {{commissioned}} by Claudio López Bru, second Marquis of Comillas, with the Franciscana Catholic Missions {{for the city of}} Tangier, in Morocco (at the time a Spanish colony). The project included a church, hospital and school, and Gaudí conceived a quadrilobulate ground-plan floor structure, with catenary arches, parabolic towers, and hyperboloid windows. Gaudí deeply regretted the project's eventual demise, always keeping his design with him. In spite of this, the project influenced the works of the Sagrada Família, in particular the design of the towers, with their <b>paraboloid</b> shape like those of the Missions.|$|E

The buildings {{were inspired by}} Le Corbusier's Philips Pavilion designed for Brussel's World Fair and the Ingalls Rink Yale University's hockey stadium by Eero Saarinen (both structures completed in 1958). The roof of the Philips pavilion was created by complex hyperbolic <b>paraboloid</b> surfaces stretched between cables. In both cases Tange took Western ideas and adapted them to meet Japanese requirements.|$|E

5|$|The curve-shortening flow {{can be used}} {{to prove}} an isoperimetric {{inequality}} for surfaces whose Gaussian curvature is a non-increasing function of the distance from the origin, such as the <b>paraboloid.</b> On such a surface, the smooth compact set that has any given area and minimum perimeter for that area is necessarily a circle centered at the origin. The proof applies the curve-shortening flow to two curves, a metric circle and the boundary of any other compact set, and compares the change in perimeter of the two curves as they are both reduced to a point by the flow.|$|E

5|$|Interferometry at Jodrell Bank started {{before the}} Lovell {{telescope}} was constructed, using the Transit Telescope with a 35 square meter broadside array {{to determine the}} size of radio-loud nebulae. Once construction of the Lovell telescope was complete, the broadside array was put on a steerable mount and the pair were used as a tracking radio interferometer. This was then {{used to determine the}} 2D shape of quasars on the sky.Rowson (1963) In the summer of 1961, a 25-foot (8-m) diameter <b>paraboloid</b> telescope was constructed (it was made of aluminium tubing and was mounted on the rotating structure of an old defence radar). This was then used as a steerable interferometer with the Mark I, with a resolution of 0.3 arcseconds, to determine the sizes of some high-redshift (z~0.86) quasars.|$|E

25|$|Although paraboloids are {{difficult}} to make from flat sheets of solid material, they can be made quite simply by rotating open-topped containers which hold liquids. The top surface of a liquid which is being rotated at constant speed around a vertical axis naturally {{takes the form of}} a <b>paraboloid.</b> Centrifugal force causes material to move outward from the axis of rotation until a deep enough depression is formed in the surface for the force to be balanced by the levelling effect of gravity. It turns out that the depression is an exact <b>paraboloid.</b> (See Liquid mirror telescope.) If the material solidifies while it is rotating, the paraboloidal shape is maintained after the rotation stops, and can be used to make a reflector. This rotation technique is sometimes used to make paraboloidal mirrors for astronomical telescopes, and has also been used for solar cookers. Devices for constructing such paraboloids are known as rotating furnaces.|$|E

25|$|Both the {{hyperboloid}} of one {{sheet and}} the hyperbolic <b>paraboloid</b> are ruled surfaces, {{meaning that they}} can be made up from a family of straight lines.

25|$|Compared with {{a single}} <b>paraboloid,</b> using two partial troughs has {{important}} advantages. Each trough is a , which can be made simply by bending a flat sheet of metal. Also, the light that reaches the targeted cooking pot is directed approximately downward, which reduces the danger of damage to the eyes of anyone nearby. On the other hand, there are disadvantages. More mirror material is needed, increasing the cost, and the light is reflected by two surfaces instead of one, which inevitably increases the amount that is lost.|$|E

The purpose of this design is to move the feed structure out of the beam path, so it does not block the beam. It is widely used in home satellite television dishes, which are small enough that the feed structure would otherwise block a significant percentage of the signal. Offset feed can also be used in multiple reflector designs such as the Cassegrain and Gregorian, below.|$|E

25|$|Since the Newtonian {{reflector}} is {{the most}} common telescope built by amateur telescope makers, large sections of the literature on the subject are devoted to fabrication of the primary mirror. The mirror has to be carefully ground, polished and figured to an extremely accurate shape, usually a <b>paraboloid.</b> Telescopes with high focal ratios may use spherical mirrors since the difference in the two shapes is insignificant at those ratios. The tools used to achieve this shape are surprisingly simple, consisting of a similarly sized glass tool, a series of finer abrasives, and a polishing pitch lap made from a type of tree sap. Through a whole series of random strokes the mirror naturally tends to become spherical in shape. At that point, a variation in polishing strokes is typically used to create and perfect the desired paraboloidal shape.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we study the L p − L r {{boundedness}} of the extension operators associated with <b>paraboloids</b> in vector spaces over finite fields. In higher even dimensions, we estimate {{the number of}} additive quadruples in the subset E of the <b>paraboloids,</b> that {{is the number of}} quadruples (x, y, z, w) ∈ E 4 with x + y = z + w. As a result, in higher even dimensions, we improve upon the standard Tomas-Stein exponents (See (1. 1) below) which Mockenhaupt and Tao ([9]) obtained for the boundedness of extension operators for <b>paraboloids</b> by estimating the decay of the Fourier transform of measures on <b>paraboloids.</b> In particular, Theorem 1 below gives the sharp L p − L 4 bound up to endpoints in higher even dimensions.

25|$|Paraboloidal reflectors {{that have}} their centres of mass {{coincident}} with their focal points are useful. They {{can be easily}} turned to follow the sun's motions in the sky, rotating about any axis that passes through the focus. Two perpendicular axes can be used, intersecting at the focus, to allow the <b>paraboloid</b> to follow both the sun's daily motion and its seasonal one. The cooking pot stays stationary at the focus. If the paraboloidal reflector is axially symmetrical and is made of material of uniform thickness, its centre of mass coincides with its focus if {{the depth of the}} reflector, measured along its axis of symmetry from the vertex to the plane of the rim, is 1.8478 times its focal length. The radius of the rim of the reflector is 2.7187 times the focal length. The angular radius of the rim, as seen from the focal point, is 72.68 degrees.|$|E
25|$|Parabolic troughs {{are used}} to {{concentrate}} sunlight for solar-energy purposes. Some solar cookers have been built that use {{them in the same}} way. Generally, the trough is aligned with its focal line horizontal and east-west. The food to be cooked is arranged along this line. The trough is pointed so its axis of symmetry aims at the sun at noon. This requires the trough to be tilted up and down as the seasons progress. At the equinoxes, no movement of the trough is needed during the day to track the sun. At other times of year, there is a period of several hours around noon each day when no tracking is needed. Usually, the cooker is used only during this period, so no automatic sun tracking is incorporated into it. This simplicity makes the design attractive, compared with using a <b>paraboloid.</b> Also, being a , the trough reflector is simpler to construct. However, it suffers from lower efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Archimedes (c.287–212 BC) of Syracuse, widely {{considered}} the greatest mathematician of antiquity, used {{the method of}} exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus. He also showed one could use the method of exhaustion to calculate the value of π with as much precision as desired, and obtained the most accurate value of π then known, 3<nbsp&πnbsp&<nbsp&3. He also studied the spiral bearing his name, obtained formulas for the volumes of surfaces of revolution (<b>paraboloid,</b> ellipsoid, hyperboloid), and an ingenious method of exponentiation for expressing very large numbers. While he is also known for his contributions to physics and several advanced mechanical devices, Archimedes himself placed far greater value on the products of his thought and general mathematical principles. He regarded as his greatest achievement his finding of the surface area and volume of a sphere, which he obtained by proving these are 2/3 the surface area and volume of a cylinder circumscribing the sphere.|$|E
