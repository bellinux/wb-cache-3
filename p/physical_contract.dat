He is then transported to Midnight, {{the heart of the}} Fairy world, while Button's {{revolution}} bears down in full force outside, accomplished by destroying the artifact bearing the <b>physical</b> <b>contract</b> made between fairies and goblins. Theo learns that the Terrible Child is to be used to unleash the horror of Old Night on the mortal realm, ruining it and giving Lord Hellebore untold power. Theo is to be used as the key to open the portal to accomplish this, using the special authority he inherited as the lord of Violet House. Per an old agreement, the key to Old Night can only be used by Violet and Hellebore together. Theo attempts to resist the Terrible Child draining him of his power but fails. In the midst of his failure the irrha appears again, only interested in destroying Theo. Theo sacrifices himself to the water nymphs, causing the irrha to attack the Terrible Child—now the closest living thing resembling Theo's essence. The Terrible Child is destroyed and Hellebore is killed in the resulting calamity, saving the mortal realm and ending the war.|$|E

Then, we focus on the driving forces behind the household differentiation process. Several conclusions can be drawn from this analysis. Firstly, the geographical domain increases as the households evolutes from farmers to entrepreneurs, and the farmers’ <b>physical</b> <b>contract</b> space is larger than the information contract space while that of brokers and entrepreneurs equals. Secondly, there is a certain pattern existing in the evolution: based on the self-techniques, farmers evolutes to flower workers, and to brokers when the capital, social network and self-ability is sufficient. As a result of appropriate policy, opportunity of building business and the risk appetite characteristics, entrepreneurs may differentiate from the brokers.

40|$|Reliable {{construction}} schedules {{are important}} for effective co-ordination across the supply chain and various trades at the construction work face. Reliability of construction schedules can be enhanced and improved through satisfying all potential constraints prior to execution on site. Availability of resources, execution space, execution logic, physical dependency of construction products, client instructions and others {{can be regarded as}} potential constraints. Current scheduling tools and techniques are fragmented and designed to deal with a limited set of construction constraints. In this context, a methodology termed 'multi-constraint scheduling' is introduced in which four major groups of construction constraints including <b>physical,</b> <b>contract,</b> resource and information constraints are considered to demonstrate the approach. A genetic algorithm (GA) has been developed and used for a multi-constraint optimization problem. Given multiple constraints such as activity dependency, limited working area, and resource and information readiness, the GA alters tasks' priorities and construction methods so as to arrive at an optimum or near optimum set of project duration, cost, and smooth resource profiles. The multi-constraints approach has been practically developed as an embedded macro in MS Project. Several experiments were conducted using a simple project and it was concluded that GA can provide near optimum and constraint-free schedules within an acceptable searching time.

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 786 on 07. 20. 2017 by CS (TIS) Risk and uncertainty have a vital impact on any business, but are particularly {{influential in the}} shipping industry. Although risk and uncertainty constitute the life-blood that courses through the veins of business, decision makers typically attempt to reduce the risks to which their decisions are subject. This is because there inevitably exists a level of risk which the decision maker is unwilling to accept. In May 1985 a new method of risk reduction in shipping became available through the introduction of BIFFEX — the Baltic International Freight Futures Exchange. Participants in shipping can now hedge against their risks in the physical market by taking {{a position on the}} new futures market. This adds a new dimension to the situation as it existed before the introduction of BIFFEX, when the hedging of market risk was undertaken solely by holding alternative forms of <b>physical</b> <b>contract.</b> Typically, decision makers in shipping have formulated hedging strategies on the basis of ad hoc, inconsistent and subjectively judgemental criteria. This work is concerned with the optimization of the risk reduction process by integrating the different forms of market investment in a portfolio context. The methodology used is based on Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). This provides a formal structure for the deduction of a subjectively optimal portfolio, {{in the sense that it}} yields the 'best' risk/return trade-off in line with a decision maker's own attitude to risk. Previously. MPT has been applied solely to the determination of optimum portfolios of stocks and shares. The theory is, therefore, refined in accordance with the requirements of shipping. Similarly, the theory has previously only been applied to investors who are ‘risk averse'. In this work, it is expanded to include those investors who are 'risk prone' or 'risk neutral'. The objective of the thesis is thus the successful implementation of M P T to allow the deduction of a subjectively optimal portfolio of shipping market investments. Galbrsuths Liinited, E. D. & F.

40|$|Nanomaterials are {{increasingly}} being used in consumer products due to their unique optical, electronic, and antibacterial properties. However, proliferated use of nanomaterials will lead to increased entrance into the environment where toxicity can occur to plants and other organisms. The focus {{of this research is}} to understand the origin of nanomaterial organismal toxicity and methods for its reduction through engineering. Nano silver, nano carbon, and nano copper were chosen as the subjects of study due to their prevalent use in consumer products, and likely entrance into the environment during use and disposal. The majority of the research focuses on silver nanomaterials (AgNMs). In {{the first part of this}} work, Chapters 2 - 5, the toxicity of AgNMs with three different shapes (i. e. silver nanoparticles, silver nanocubes, and silver nanowires) was examined in environmentally relevant and model organisms including Lolium multiflorum, Danio rerio, Caenorhabditis elegans, and the bacterial strains Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus to determine if the shape of the AgNM affected its toxicity. Shape was shown to affect the toxicity of silver nanomaterials to L. multiflorum; silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were more toxic than silver nanocubes (AgNCs) and silver nanowires (AgNWs). However, this shape-based toxic effect was not found in the other species examined. To further understand the shape-specific toxicity, dissolution and <b>physical</b> <b>contract</b> were studied. While dissolution is often assumed to be the cause of silver nanomaterial toxicity, we concluded that dissolution alone did not account for all of the toxicity shown. Instead, physical contact between the nanomaterial and plant was found to be necessary for shape-based phytotoxicity. The surface reactivity was experimentally calculated for each nanomaterial to determine if different surface reactivity between different AgNM shapes could further explain phytotoxicity. It was shown that this value correlated to phytotoxicity, suggesting surface reactivity might be related to nanomaterial toxicity in environmentally relevant organisms. Since AgNMs are likely to undergo chemical and physical transformations after entrance into the environment, the effect of sulfidation on shape-based phytotoxicity was studied. Sulfidizing the AgNMs resulted in an increase in size due to the formation of a silver sulfide shell. Sulfidation was found to decrease AgNM toxicity toward L. multiflorum, D. rerio, and C. elegans. However, it was determined that shape still affected the AgNM toxicity after sulfidation. Due to their lack of phytotoxicity as compared to bacterial toxicity, AgNCs were chosen as a precursor for a novel silver-antibiotic hybrid surface coating. Silver nanocubes were functionalized with a sub-monolayer of gold (Au@AgNC) to increase the ease of covalent attachment of functional moieties. The Au@AgNCs were then covalently functionalized with gentamicin, a commonly used antibiotic. The gentamicin-Au@AgNCs showed increased bacterial toxicity to Staphylococcus aureus compared to a mixed gentamicin and Au@AgNC composite. Phytotoxicity of the gentamicin-Au@AgNC compound was found to be minimal in L. multiflorum, Lactuca sativa, and Solanum lycopersicum. In this work the physical and chemical properties of nanostructures were tuned to reduce environmental toxicity while retaining desired functional properties. The research was also extended to other nanomaterials. In Chapter 7, the effect of copper nanowire (CuNW) diameter on phytotoxicity was studied in the plant species L. multiflorum, L. sativa, and S. lycopersicum. L. multiflorum and S. lycopersicum did not show any diameter-based toxicity, though L. sativa did. Smaller diameters correlated to increased toxicity in L. sativa, and all CuNWs were more toxic than ionic copper. CuNWs were aged to simulate more realistic plant exposures. After aging, CuNWs were less toxic, though the diameter-based toxicity trend was still present. To further understand the diameter-based toxicity, dissolution was studied. It was determined that dissolution alone could not account for the phytotoxicity shown. In Chapter 8, the recently synthesized material soluble graphitic nanofiber (SGNF) was studied for its phytotoxicity to plants using the environmentally relevant and model plant species L. multiflorum, L. sativa, and S. lycopersicum. SGNFs consist of a carbon nanotube (CNT) core wrapped with sheets of graphene oxide (GO). As both of these materials are toxic, it was hypothesized that their toxicity would be additive in SGNFs. In plant growth assays, GO was the most phytotoxic and CNTs were the least phytotoxic. SGNFs were between the GO and CNTs for toxicity. It was determined that pH of the solution played a minor effect on the decreased growth shown. The majority of toxicity could be attributed to agglomeration of SGNFs onto the surface of the plant root. Additionally, four zero-dimensional carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) were studied to determine if chemical bonding properties affected their phytotoxicity to the plant species L. multiflorum, L. sativa, and S. lycopersicum. Nanodiamond, onion-like carbon, partially graphitized nanodiamond, and carbon dots were all studied to determine if exposure resulted in decreased germination, root, or shoot growth. Generally, all four CNMS resulted in similar or increased growth compared to the control. This data suggests that differences in chemical bonding are unlikely to cause toxicity at environmentally relevant concentrations. Finally, graphene oxide was studied as a surface coating for ceramic pot water filtration devices (CPWFDs). GO was covalently attached to the ceramic membrane surface using linker chemistry. The ceramic membranes were challenged with Esherichia coli to determine their bacterial removal efficiency. Hydraulic conductivity was also measured to determine the water flux of the ceramic membranes as a proxy for measuring membrane fouling. The results from these studies show that a greater understanding of how physico-chemical properties affect toxicity toward environmentally relevant organisms is necessary to better engineer nanomaterials with increased desired properties while reducing unintended consequences. Additionally, this work showed collaborations among scientists from different disciplines were necessary to better understand the complex scientific question of environmental fate and toxicity of nanomaterials.

40|$|Capítulos en librosAfter {{decades of}} strong opposition, several European {{countries}} {{are now in}} the process of implementing some kind of capacity remuneration mechanism (CRM). Unfortunately, these national initiatives seem to aim at energy autarky rather than seeking a wider regional coordination. The main reason for this approach is a lack of confidence in the regional market outputs during scarcity conditions. The threat perceived by regulators is that, in the current framework, during system stress events, each country will protect the rights of its domestic demand, impeding the fulfilment of contracts previously signed. However, this situation can significantly affect the potential benefits of an integrated long-term expansion of the European power system. In this article, the regulatory basis for the effective participation of foreign agents in national CRMs is discussed. The authors support that two pillars are required: (1) stronger coordination among TSOs and respect for the Security of Supply Directive and (2) introduction of a particular type of firm cross-border nominations associated to the CRMs commitments. These proposed nominations are to be considered only in situations of system stress. As it will be discussed, this allows not requiring any type of ex-ante cross-border capacity reservation, thus avoiding many of the inefficiencies associated to traditional <b>physical</b> <b>contracts.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|The {{deregulation}} of the European power market brings new sales prospects for the power-suppliers {{as well as an}} appreciable increase of entrepreneurial risks. In order to handle the novel price- and volume-risks, the optimisation of decisionmaking under uncertain boundary conditions is of essential interest. The former task of resource management in energy-supply was the minimisation of costs for the fulfilment of a foreseeable power-request at long-ranging conditions of pricing. Now a multicriterial optimisation problem arises: simultaneous minimisation of cost and risk. In the last years a number of power-exchanges have been established where power is physically traded day-ahead and derivatively as future contracts. Furthermore, financial power-derivatives like Options, Caps, Floors or Swaps are traded bilateral in the so called over-the-counter market. A serious question is how to use different <b>physical</b> <b>contracts</b> and financial derivatives in an optimal way to protect a power purchase portfolio against market risks. Facing this question, a multicriterial linear stochastic optimisation model has been developed. It is based on scenarios for the market price, generated by Monte-Carlo-simulation that uses a mean-reversion market model calibrated for the German power spot-market. The different optimisation criteria are merged into a single objective by a weighted summation. Individual risk aversion is considered by the coefficients of the weighted sum. The model is adapted to resolvability by Benders-Decomposition in a way that even a larger number of optimisations with different coefficients of the weighted sum can be solved in acceptable time giving an idea of the shape of the efficiency-frontier. Nevertheless all important microeconomic features have been taken into account...|$|R
