40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to find out {{problems}} encountered by Foskor Mine workers in Phalaborwa with the use of <b>personal</b> protective <b>equipment</b> and also to find out how these problems can be prevented or solved. A quantitative research study was done using a questionnaire as a data gathering tool on workers who are exposed to occupational injuries and illnesses and who use <b>personal</b> protective <b>equipment</b> for their protection. The findings revealed that even though workers were using <b>personal</b> protective <b>equipment</b> they still got occupational injuries and illnesses. They also had problems with their protective equipment like incompatible types of <b>personal</b> protective <b>equipment,</b> such as weight where heavy <b>personal</b> protective <b>equipment</b> like boots were issued and very hot or cold <b>personal</b> protective <b>equipment</b> incompatible with the temperature of the environment. Some <b>personal</b> protective <b>equipment</b> like gloves were of a wrong size and caused allergy.

Still, users of PE are too often confronted with {{shortcomings}} in their PE: they may be hampered, or and/or individual components of the PE ensemble do not work together. So the question is: do we {{really know how to}} procure PE effectively? TNO worked on a research program called innovative <b>personal</b> <b>equipment</b> (IPE), in close cooperation with the RNlA (Oudenhuijzen, 2011). Three aspects, in support of PE procurement, where the main drivers for this research program: 1. Material innovations: what innovations are implementable, today and in the near future for <b>personal</b> <b>equipment?</b> 2. Thermal modelling: create a model {{that can be used to}} design <b>personal</b> <b>equipment</b> with regard to activities and prevention of thermal strain; 3. Development of knowledge and methods/related tools for PE system engineering and to obtain the users operational needs. The ultimate objective of the RNlA is to procure PE as an integral system instead of an assembly of individual components.

The effectiveness of <b>personal</b> protective <b>equipment</b> is highly dependent on adequate staff training. In this project, a computer simulation program, as a supplement to conventional training approaches, was developed to facilitate the learning of the proper use of <b>personal</b> protective <b>equipment.</b> The simulation program was a Web-based interactive software with user-friendly graphical interface for users to practice the use of <b>personal</b> protective <b>equipment</b> usage via drag-and-drop metaphors and respond to questions online. The effectiveness of the computer simulation software was investigated by a controlled study. Fifty healthcare workers were randomly assigned into two groups: one received conventional <b>personal</b> protective <b>equipment</b> training only (control group), whereas the other also received the same conventional training but followed by using the developed simulation program for self-learning (experimental group). Their performance was assessed by <b>personal</b> protective <b>equipment</b> donning and doffing evaluation before and after the training.
