40|$|The {{reason for}} weight loss at high altitudes is largely unknown. To date, studies {{have been unable to}} {{differentiate}} between weight loss due to hypobaric hypoxia and that related to increased physical exercise. The aim of our {{study was to examine the}} effect of hypobaric hypoxia on body weight at high altitude in obese subjects. We investigated 20 male obese subjects (age 55. 7 +/- 4. 1 years, BMI 33. 7 +/- 1. 0 kg/m(2)). Body weight, waist circumference, basal metabolic rate (BMR), nutrition protocols, and objective activity parameters as well as metabolic and cardiovascular parameters, blood gas analysis, leptin, and ghrelin were determined at low altitude (LA) (Munich 530 m, D 1), at the beginning and at the end of a 1 -week stay at high altitude (2, 650 m, D 7 and D 14) and 4 weeks after returning to LA (D 42). Although daily <b>pace</b> <b>counting</b> remained stable at high altitude, at D 14 and D 42, participants weighed significantly less and had higher BMRs than at D 1. Food intake was decreased at D 7. Basal leptin levels increased significantly at high altitude despite the reduction in body weight. Diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower at D 7, D 14, and D 42 compared to D 1. This study shows that obese subjects lose weight at high altitudes. This may be due to a higher metabolic rate and reduced food intake. Interestingly, leptin levels rise in high altitude despite reduced body weight. Hypobaric hypoxia seems to play a major role, although the physiological mechanisms remain unclear. Weight loss at high altitudes was associated with clinically relevant improvements in diastolic blood pressure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: For {{decades the}} {{dismounted}} soldier has navigated to his mission objective using maps, a compass, and his <b>pace</b> <b>count</b> as navigation tools. Recently, Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers were added {{as an additional}} aid to dismounted navigation. However, GPS is limited as a navigation aid by its inability to provide static heading and its lack of availability when used around obstructions (terrain or man-made), or {{in the presence of}} jannning. Therefore, maps, a compass, and a <b>pace</b> <b>count</b> are still needed to ensure successful navigation. Under the Force XXI Land Warrior (FXXI LW) program, a Government-Industry team is prototyping an integrated navigation system for the dismounted soldier. The integrated navigation system consists of GPS and a Dead Reckoning Module (DRM). The DRM makes use of state-of-the-art, small, low power electronic components in a single miniaturized package to replace the compass and the need for the soldier to <b>count</b> <b>paces.</b> The DRM design allows hands-free navigation. The DRM data and GPS information are used by a Kaiman filter to form an integrated navigation solution by balancing the weaknesses of one sensor using the strengths of the other sensor. The integrated navigation design provides automatic selection of one navigation m QUALrre raapsensD 4 data source when the data from the other position sensor is corrupted or not available. The design also provides for manual selection/deselection of a navigation source. Upon successful completion of testing, the integrated navigation technology will be transitioned to the Land Warrior (LW) system. This paper will discuss the DRM and the Integrated Navigation development, assessments performed to date, and future plans...|$|R
60|$|It {{began to}} grow dark in earnest. We could no longer {{distinguish}} {{the faces of the}} people who passed us by with an inarticulate good- evening. And the householders of Pont seemed very economical with their oil; for we saw not a single window lighted in all that long village. I believe it is the longest village in the world; but I daresay in our predicament every <b>pace</b> <b>counted</b> three times over. We were much cast down when we came to the last auberge; and looking in at the dark door, asked timidly if we could sleep there for the night. A female voice assented in no very friendly tones. We clapped the bags down and found our way to chairs.|$|R
5000|$|The ball must {{be struck}} {{on the ground}} (bunted) once it is within 40 feet, or 13 paces of the hole. Because Wiffle Golf is a gentleman's game, the <b>paces</b> are <b>counted</b> by the person about to strike the ball and it is {{unnecessary}} to bring a tape measure onto the course.|$|R
50|$|Pacing {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} more {{commonly}} used metric system by simply walking 100 m and marking down the number of paces required. Doing that several times and using the average will give a good idea of how many paces are made every 100 m. In the field, <b>paces</b> are <b>counted</b> until the target number for 100 m, which is then repeated.|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} {{topography}} in fish culture in Nigeria part two {{is aimed at}} bridging the technical language gap between the fish culturist and; both land surveyors and civil engineers. The fish culturists {{need to understand the}} principles in topography for good site selection in fish culture. The fish farmer can design and build fishponds, reservoirs and small dams and use existing topographical maps. An adequate knowledge of topography by fish culturist bridges the technical language gap between the fish culturist and; both land surveyors and civil engineers. The fish culturist can discuss his plans, projects and understand books on topography, engineering and surveying. Good fish farm construction can only be possible with the right topography. Features of a fish pond, different kinds of pond, advantages and disadvantages of these types of pond, basic pond types, characteristics of shallow and deep ponds, setting out a straight line between two points, prolonging a line, horizontal distance measurement, <b>pace</b> <b>count,</b> chaining, clisimeter, stadia method are some principles in topography for good site selection in fish culture reviewed in this part aimed at enabling the fish culturists know these basic principles to design and build fishponds, reservoirs and small dams and use existing topographical maps...|$|R

It was the last region of the United Kingdom to declare its result after major delays due to slow <b>pace</b> of <b>counting</b> and declaring results for the 2011 Northern Ireland Assembly Elections meant that the start of the local count for the referendum could not begin until the evening on Friday 6 May 2011, several hours after counting had started {{in the rest of the}} country and the result was not finally known until 1am on Saturday 7 May 2011.|$|R
50|$|Like his brother, Duff {{also played}} {{first-class}} cricket. He made his {{debut in the}} 1904/05 Currie Cup cricket season, against Transvaal. A medium <b>pace</b> bowler, he <b>counted</b> Test opener Jimmy Sinclair {{as one of his}} two first innings wickets. It was until 1910 that he appeared in another first-class fixture, with Rhodesia hosting the H. D. G. Leveson Gower's XI. He took four wickets in the space of four overs in the fourth innings, conceding 11 runs, as the match ended in a draw.|$|R
50|$|Controls {{should be}} {{moderately}} difficult. Navigation {{should not be}} primarily along paths. A compass is necessary. Course choice is actively encouraged. However, every control should be within 100m of an attack point, or obvious feature, and beyond the control should be a linear catch feature, so that the runner knows when s/he has gone too far. On {{no more than two}} legs should navigation rely solely on compass and <b>counting</b> <b>paces.</b> Orange course are often perceived as much more difficult than yellow. Once you can reliably complete orange courses, you have learned the basic skill.|$|R

30|$|Participants engaged {{either in}} 5  minutes of step-exercise (exercise condition) or 5  minutes of quiet activity, {{during which they}} built freely with {{connecting}} toy pieces (K’Nex; non-exercise condition). The exercise condition involved repeatedly stepping on and off of a 6.5 ” step, self <b>paced,</b> while <b>counting</b> the number of steps made. The non-exercise condition involved freely joining pieces together while keeping count {{of the number of}} pieces used. Counting was used in both conditions as a means to discourage participants from rehearsing information from the learning phase. An experimenter used a stopwatch to time both the exercise and non-exercise activities and told the participant to stop at the end of 5  minutes. The two types of post-learning activity were performed alone in a small room, behind a closed door, and only one participant was run at a time. After engaging in the activity, subjective emotional state and heart rate were measured again via an affect grid and fingertip pulse oximeter.|$|R
40|$|This paper builds {{upon the}} authors’ {{previous}} research {{in which the}} competency building process of individuals was analyzed in a purely synchronous computer game-based teaching technology. The issue of heterogeneity of speed of adaptation to the learning tool, identified in the synchronous context, is here addressed by introducing the flexibility of an asynchronous format, in which students are {{given the opportunity to}} complete the game at their own <b>pace.</b> Experts <b>count</b> game-based teaching amongst the technologies likely to have the largest impact on education over the next five years. Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOG) are based on multiple interactions between different humans in virtual worlds. A MMOG teaching game was created in a virtual world. Participant discourses based on written chats were collected and exploited by netnography. Visual data was filmed and analyzed by the semiotics method then compared to the discourse analysis. First results show interesting differences between synchronous and asynchronous modes, in the interaction and collaboration within and across teams...|$|R
