25|$|Rotary exhaust {{temperatures}} reach , and as such, on a motorcycle, {{required a}} specialized exhaust system. Suzuki {{dealt with the}} problem by first exhausting into a large, heavily finned manifold which split the single exhaust into two streams. They then built two twin-shelled exhaust pipes which included air cooling ducts. Each muffler contains a stainless steel inner pipe {{which is a little}} shorter than the length of the external shell. The internal <b>pipe</b> <b>ends</b> in a removable stinger drilled with numerous holes and wrapped in a fibreglass-like material. The stinger (or spark arrestor as Suzuki calls it) exits the exhaust system {{at the end of the}} external shell. At the front of each pipe was a small forward-facing grille which allowed cool ambient air to be forced into the pipe by the bike's forward motion and to travel the length of the exhaust between the internal and external pipes. It then flowed through the holes drilled in the stinger, mixing with the hot exhaust gasses before exiting the system. Even so, Suzuki found it prudent to fit heat shields on the outside of the pipe to further protect riders and pillions. The bike's sound is unique among its two- and four-stroke contemporaries but also quite loud. Early in production (December 1974, Frame #11901), Suzuki reduced the size of the spark arrestor tubes, which both reduced noise and horsepower, but the RE5 exhaust note remains distinctive.|$|E
2500|$|The flying boom is {{attached}} {{to the rear of the}} tanker aircraft. [...] The attachment is gimballed, allowing the boom to move with the receiver aircraft. The boom contains a rigid pipe to transfer fuel. The fuel <b>pipe</b> <b>ends</b> in a nozzle with a flexible ball joint. [...] The nozzle mates to the [...] "receptacle" [...] in the receiver aircraft during fuel transfer. [...] A poppet valve in the end of the nozzle prevents fuel from exiting the tube until the nozzle properly mates with the receiver's refueling receptacle. [...] Once properly mated, toggles in the receptacle engage the nozzle, holding it locked during fuel transfer.|$|E
50|$|On {{fittings}} such as Tee's, elbows, bends, etc., powder can be sprayed using {{hand held}} spray guns. Small sized fittings {{can also be}} coated by dipping in a fluidized bed of powder, after heating the steel to the required powder application temperature. After field welding of the <b>pipe</b> <b>ends,</b> FBE can be applied on the weld area as well.|$|E

50|$|For the Retaining Ring connection, {{a groove}} will be {{machined}} onto the <b>pipe</b> <b>end</b> {{to hold the}} retaining ring. The retaining ring is made of a segmented stainless steel ring covered by a steainless steel spring and is used to fix the flange. For the assembly, the retaining ring flange has to be put onto the machined <b>pipe</b> <b>end.</b> The retaining ring has to be widened for getting it on the <b>pipe</b> <b>end</b> to snap into the before machined groove. The inside contour of the retaining ring flange will cover the retaining ring from the outside.|$|R
50|$|By flaring the <b>pipe</b> <b>end,</b> {{the flange}} gets a {{supporting}} surface {{and is able}} to build up force to ensure a stable connection.|$|R
5000|$|Mechanical piping joining {{systems are}} being used in HVAC, plumbing, fire {{protection}} and mining, water and waste water treatment, oilfield operations, power plants, military, marine systems and other industrial applications due to the time and labor-saving features associated with installation. [...] Mechanical piping systems offer an alternative to welding, threading, and flanging for joining two <b>pipe</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Pipelines can {{be created}} under program control. The Unix [...] system call asks the {{operating}} system to construct a new anonymous pipe object. This results in two new, opened file descriptors in the process: the read-only end of the pipe, and the write-only end. The <b>pipe</b> <b>ends</b> appear to be normal, anonymous file descriptors, except {{that they have no}} ability to seek.|$|E
50|$|Even {{within one}} church, the pitch used could vary over {{time because of}} the way organs were tuned. Generally, the end of an organ pipe would be {{hammered}} inwards to a cone, or flared outwards, to raise or lower the pitch. When the <b>pipe</b> <b>ends</b> became frayed by this constant process they were all trimmed down, thus raising the overall pitch of the organ.|$|E
50|$|Afterwards, {{the flange}} will be {{positioned}} to the <b>pipe</b> <b>end</b> {{and connected to}} a hydraulic component or another pipe having a similar flange and corresponding insert.|$|R

50|$|Flaring TechnologyAfter {{putting a}} F37 flange onto a {{seamless}} hydraulic tube or <b>pipe,</b> the tube <b>end</b> will be flared to 37째, what also explains {{the name of}} this technology. The flaring is done by a special orbitally flaring process, which compresses the surface of the <b>pipe</b> <b>end,</b> gaining an excellent sealing surface.|$|R
50|$|Shape-memory {{coupling}} is {{a system}} for connecting pipes using shape-memory alloys. In its typical form the technique uses an internally ribbed sleeve of alloy such as Tinel that is slightly smaller in diameter than the pipes it is to connect. The sleeve is cooled in liquid nitrogen then, in this low-temperature state, mechanically expanded with a mandrel to fit easily over the two <b>pipe</b> <b>ends</b> to be joined. After fitting, it is allowed to rewarm, when the memory effect causes the sleeve to shrink back to its original smaller size, creating a tight joint.|$|E
5000|$|The flying boom is {{attached}} {{to the rear of the}} tanker aircraft. The attachment is gimballed, allowing the boom to move with the receiver aircraft. The boom contains a rigid pipe to transfer fuel. The fuel <b>pipe</b> <b>ends</b> in a nozzle with a flexible ball joint. The nozzle mates to the [...] "receptacle" [...] in the receiver aircraft during fuel transfer. A poppet valve in the end of the nozzle prevents fuel from exiting the tube until the nozzle properly mates with the receiver's refueling receptacle. Once properly mated, toggles in the receptacle engage the nozzle, holding it locked during fuel transfer.|$|E
50|$|The {{spring is}} {{pushed into the}} pipe until its center is roughly where the bend is to be. A length of {{flexible}} wire can {{be attached to the}} end of the spring to facilitate its removal. The pipe is generally held against the flexed knee, and the ends of the pipe are pulled up to create the bend. To make it easier to retrieve the spring from the pipe, it is a good idea to bend the pipe slightly more than required, and then slacken it off a little. They are less cumbersome than rotary benders, but are not suitable for bending short lengths of piping when it is difficult to get the required leverage on the <b>pipe</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In a {{situation}} where neither threaded <b>pipe</b> <b>end</b> can be rotated to tighten or loosen the joint (e.g. in traditional heating pipes running through multiple rooms in a building). In such a case, the coupling will have one right-handed and one left-handed thread.|$|R

50|$|In Morocco and Tunisia the {{instrument}}, called zamr, has {{a single}} or double bell. The Moroccan instrument has six holes in each pipe. The Moroccan mizm훮r or zamr r카f카 is over 100 centimetres long, again with six holes in each <b>pipe,</b> <b>ending</b> in two bull's horns.|$|R
5000|$|An insert made {{of carbon}} or {{stainless}} steel {{will be placed}} into the flared pipe end. The insert is soft sealed by an O-Ring to the pipe side. To be sealed against a flat counterpart (e.g. manifold or block) the insert has a groove on the front side for a so-called [...] "F37-Seal" [...] made of Polyurethane or optionally an o-ring or bonded seal made of carbon steel or stainless steel with a Nitrile rubber or FKM sealing lip. Alternatively, the front side of the insert can be flat. For a pipe to pipe connection, a special insert design with soft sealed cones on both sides to fit between two flared <b>pipe</b> <b>ends</b> is available.|$|E
50|$|A grooved fitting, {{also known}} as a grooved {{coupling}}, has four elements: grooved pipe, gasket, coupling housing, and nuts and bolts. The groove is made by cold-forming (or machining) a groove {{at the end of a}} pipe. A gasket encompassed by coupling housing is wrapped around the two <b>pipe</b> <b>ends,</b> with the coupling engaging the groove; the bolts and nuts are tightened with a socket or impact wrench. The installed coupling housing encases the gasket and engages the grooves around the pipe to create a leakproof seal in a self-restrained pipe joint. There are two types of grooved coupling; a flexible coupling allows a limited amount of angular movement, and a rigid coupling does not allow movement and may be used where joint immobility is required (similar to a flange or welded joint).|$|E
5000|$|A Toroidal {{expansion}} joint is a metallic assembly {{that consists of}} a series of toroidal convolutions which are circular tubes wrapped around <b>pipe</b> <b>ends</b> or weld ends and have a gap at the inside diameter to allow for axial stroke while absorbing changes in expansion or contraction of the pipe line. Convolutions are the portion of the bellows that allow it to be flexible. The convolutions are formed around reinforcing bands so that only the concave portion of the torus allows for flexibility. Toroidal {{expansion joint}}s are typically used in high pressure applications, where little movement is required, and generally used for heat exchangers. Usually, they are hydraulically formed, but others are free formed. [...] These expansion joints are also referred to as [...] "Omega" [...] bellows due to their shape resembling the Greek letter, Omega.|$|E
50|$|The special inside contour of the {{retaining}} ring flange covers the {{retaining ring}}, which is installed onto the machined <b>pipe</b> <b>end.</b> A form-closed connection {{results from the}} tightening of the flange, which will be sealed by bonded seal or pipe seal carrier on the face side.|$|R

50|$|The {{bomb was}} made of metal that {{could have come from}} a home workshop. The primary {{component}} was a piece of metal pipe, about 1 in in diameter and 9 in long. The bomb contained smokeless explosive powders, and the box and the plugs that sealed the <b>pipe</b> <b>ends</b> were handcrafted from wood. In comparison, most pipe bombs usually use threaded metal ends sold in many hardware stores. Wooden ends lack the strength to allow significant pressure to build within the pipe, explaining why the bomb did not cause severe damage. The primitive trigger device that the bomb employed was a nail, tensioned by rubber bands designed to slam into six common match heads when the box was opened. The match heads would burst into flame and ignite the explosive powders. When the trigger hit the match heads, only three ignited. A more efficient technique, later employed by Kaczynski, was to use batteries and heat filament wire to ignite the explosives faster and more effectively.|$|E
