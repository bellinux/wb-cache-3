25|$|In 1921, graves {{were found}} {{northwest}} of Grenadier Pond on the sandy ridge, {{during the course}} of road construction near Harcroft and Olympus Avenue, then the Harcroft Bird Sanctuary of architect J. A. Harvey. Eight skeletons were found in the sitting position in red sand below a huge stump. Other, smaller skeletons were found nearby. The human remains were dated to between 2,500 BC to 800 AD, indicating some sort of indigenous peoples' presence at High Park. The remains were coated in hematite red <b>powdery</b> <b>substance</b> in the custom of the Red Paint People who lived in New England and Atlantic Canada. The site is also similar to the Red Ocher people indigenous people who made burials in sandy ridges.|$|E
25|$|Pollen {{is a fine}} to coarse <b>powdery</b> <b>substance</b> {{comprising}} pollen grains {{which are}} male microgametophytes of seed plants, which produce male gametes (sperm cells). Pollen grains have a hard coat made of sporopollenin that protects the gametophytes {{during the process of}} their movement from the stamens to the pistil of flowering plants or from the male cone to the female cone of coniferous plants. If pollen lands on a compatible pistil or female cone, it germinates, producing a pollen tube that transfers the sperm to the ovule containing the female gametophyte. Individual pollen grains are small enough to require magnification to see detail. The study of pollen is called palynology and is highly useful in paleoecology, paleontology, archaeology, and forensics.|$|E
500|$|The {{failure to}} prosecute the trio with federal charges caused some {{speculation}} about a government cover-up, particularly revolving around Troy Eid, who was appointed U.S. Attorney by President George W. Bush, and {{has been accused of}} showing political biases. Some questioned why Eid did not pursue federal charges against Gartrell, Adolf and Johnson, but filed similar charges against Marc Harold Ramsey, who allegedly sent a threatening letter to 2008 Republican presidential nominee Senator John McCain from behind bars in the Arapahoe County Jail. Ramsey, who faced five years in federal prison and $250,000 in fines if convicted, sent McCain a package with a harmless white <b>powdery</b> <b>substance</b> and a letter that read, [...] "Senator McCain, If you are reading this then you are already DEAD! Unless of course you can't or don't breathe." [...] Eid said the Ramsey case was [...] "absolutely distinguishable" [...] from that of Gartrell, Adolf and Johnson because {{there was no evidence of}} actual planning on the part of the trio.|$|E

500|$|The {{state of}} Eyre Highway {{remained}} relatively unchanged throughout the 1940s and 1950s. The road received yearly maintenance, but further, more expensive works were not warranted {{due to the}} low traffic volume of approximately fourteen vehicles per day. However, the maintenance and grading was hindered {{by a lack of}} rainfall – the road was smoothed out each year, and small sections were gravelled, but the soil the road was made from was too weak to be an effective road surface. When it did rain, even in small amounts, the road would become boggy, from patches that had broken down into a <b>powdery</b> <b>substance</b> (known as [...] "bulldust") during dry periods. Large numbers of vehicles travelling the highway in 1962, for the Commonwealth Games in Perth, damaged the road [...] in numerous locations, and the lack of moisture required salt water to be pumped from [...] below the surface for use in repairs and maintenance.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{light bulbs}} have either clear or coated glass. The coated glass bulbs have a white <b>powdery</b> <b>substance</b> {{on the inside}} called kaolin. Kaolin, or kaolinite, is a white, chalky clay in a very fine powder form, that is blown in and electrostatically {{deposited}} on {{the interior of the}} bulb. It diffuses the light emitted from the filament, producing a more gentle and evenly distributed light. Manufacturers may add pigments to the kaolin to adjust the characteristics of the final light emitted from the bulb. Kaolin diffused bulbs are used extensively in interior lighting because of their comparatively gentle light. Other kinds of colored bulbs are also made, including the various colors used for [...] "party bulbs", Christmas tree lights and other decorative lighting. These are created by coloring the glass with a dopant; which is often a metal like cobalt (blue) or chromium (green). Neodymium-containing glass is sometimes used to provide a more natural-appearing light.|$|E

40|$|Powder mixing as {{demonstrated}} previously {{is an important}} step in the manufacturing process of many industrial products such as pharmaceuticals, foodstuffs, plastics, fertilizers, and ceramics. The schatz geometry shaker-mixer is used for a homogeneous mixing of <b>powdery</b> <b>substances</b> with differing specific weights and particle sizes. The product is mixed in its own closed container. The exceptional efficiency of the schatz geometry shaker-mixer arises from the use of rotation, translation and inversion according to the Schatz geometric theory. The mixing container is set into a three-dimensional movement that exposes the product to continuously changing, rhythmically pulsing motion. It operates by tumbling the solids inside a revolving vessel, at speeds up to about 40 rpm. It is also possible to mix wet and dry components or different wet components.

The relation of water absorption and acid-base properties of the surface is considered. The advantages of the research of acid-base properties of the surface by the pH-metry method are illustrated. The algorithm of the processing and interpretation of pH metric results to diagnose water absorption of <b>powdery</b> <b>substances</b> is suggested. The diagnostics is based on the research of velocity variation of mass transfer in the reaction zone in time. The change of pH suspension per unit of time is considered {{for the first time as}} an analytic signal of «WрН» mass transfer velocity. It is demonstrated that the velocity variation of mass transfer in the system “solid body-water” reflects the stopping mechanism of ion exchange and can be used for prognosis of hydrophobic behavior of the solid body surface.

40|$|After terrorists {{attacked}} the United States in 2001, {{the appearance of}} letters and other objects containing <b>powdery</b> <b>substances</b> with unknown potentials for biological threat focused attention on the speed, sensitivity, and reliability of diagnostic methods. This study summarizes the abilities and limitations of real-time PCR, electron microscopy (EM), and virus isolation when used to detect potential bioweapons. In particular, we investigated the inhibitory influences of different common household products present in environmental specimens on PCR yield, EM detection, and virus isolation. We used vaccinia virus {{as a model for}} orthopoxviruses by spiking it into specimens. In {{the second part of the}} study, we describe modifications of diagnostic methods to overcome inhibitory effects. A variety of PCR amplification enhancers, DNA extraction protocols, and applications of internal controls were evaluated to improve diagnostic simplicity, speed, and reliability. As a result, we strongly recommend using at least two different frontline techniques in parallel, e. g., EM and PCR. A positive result obtained by any one of these techniques should be followed by a biological method to confirm the putative diagnosis. Confirmatory methods include virus isolation followed by an agent-specific immunofluorescence assay to confirm the presence of replication-competent particles...|$|R
40|$|The {{optimization}} {{process of}} coal defrosting in defrosting tunnels is solved in this article. Individual technical solutions of defrosting tunnels, {{as well as}} energy demands, are dealt with in this report. Defrosting tunnels are used for the defrosting of deep-frozen substrates like coal, ore or <b>powdery</b> <b>substances.</b> There are two different ways of defrosting. The first one is based on convective heating and the second one on radiant heating. Nowadays, convective heating is used much more than radiant heating.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis presents a new, unified approach to nonlinear microspectroscopy employing tailored broadband femtosecond laser radiation. The key concept is to functionalize the femtosecond excitation {{in order to}} implement a series of multiphoton spectroscopy techniques, especially for microscopic imaging. The most important application is coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopy, which allows chemical identification of untreated samples in microscopy due to their characteristic vibrational spectra. The presented approach allows huge experimental simplifications of CARS, schemes for very rapid spectral acquisition and determination of the chemical composition (based on the quantitative analysis of entangled multiplex spectra by evolutionary algorithm fitting), {{as well as new}} methods for microscopic CARS measurements in the time-domain, resolving molecular vibrations temporally. This is possible, because coherent control of the signal generation is applied, manipulating the quantum mechanical processes of the underlying light-matter interaction by shaping the excitation light field in phase, amplitude and polarization. Thus, spectroscopic function and even molecular control is imprinted on the excitation pulses. It is shown that this idea of functional “photonic integration” can be pursued even further by incorporating an interferometric detection scheme in the same pulses without any additional optical elements in the experimental setup, drastically improving the measurement sensitivity by more than three orders of magnitude. In addition to these novel conceptual findings, new technological developments have been invented and pushed forward. These include the generation of ultrabroadband femtosecond radiation in microstructured optical fibres and its precise phase measurement and management, which is a prerequisite for coherent control. In this context, a new pulse-shaper enabled variant of SPIDER was developed, allowing very rapid compression in collinear beam geometry in the microscope. Employing the developed set of tools and concepts, application examples are given ranging from quantitative chemical imaging of polymer blend samples, to the chemical identification of potentially hazardous <b>powdery</b> <b>substances</b> and the microanalytical sensing of the chemical composition in a microfluidic device...|$|R
