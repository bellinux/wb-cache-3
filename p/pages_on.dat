5|$|The 1990s saw the Echo take a huge {{technological}} leap forward when a £12million printing press was installed. It {{was used for}} the first time in December 1996 and was capable of printing up to 70,000newspapers an hour. The press was part of a multimillion-pound revamp, which also saw journalists making up full news <b>pages</b> <b>on</b> computer screens for the first time. The Echos first internet news service was also launched in 1996. A further £5million was spent on updating the pre-press and press hall area in 2004, to improve printing quality and speed of production.|$|E
5|$|The {{publication}} of works on archaeology and art {{followed the same}} pattern as with works on physical and natural sciences: that of an itinerary with descriptions of the roads travelled, noteworthy monuments along these routes and descriptions of their destinations. Hence, volume I of Expédition de Morée. Section des Beaux Arts describes Navarino (pp.1–7) with six pages of plates (fountains, churches, the fortress of Navarino and the palace of Nestor at Pylos); then on pages 9–10, the Navarino-Methoni road is detailed with four pages of plates (a church in ruins and its frescoes, but also bucolic landscapes reminding the reader that the scene is not so far from Arcadia); and finally three <b>pages</b> <b>on</b> Methoni and four pages of plates. The bucolic landscapes were rather close to the “norm” that Hubert Robert had proposed for depictions of Greece.|$|E

25|$|As of 2009, the {{blacklist}} {{was said}} to contain about 450 URLs.
