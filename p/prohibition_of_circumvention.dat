5000|$|There {{have been}} a variety of criticisms of this treaty, {{including}} {{that it is too}} broad (for example in its <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumvention</b> of technical protection measures, even where such circumvention is used in the pursuit of legal and fair use rights) and that it applies a [...] "one size fits all" [...] standard to all signatory countries despite widely differing stages of economic development and knowledge industry.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to perceived wide-scale copyright infringement, copyright owners began to implement technological locks and digital rights management. However, hackers have continually demonstrated success in circumventing such measures. For example, Blu-ray discs employ the Advanced Access Copy System “AACS”. AACS {{has been successfully}} attacked on numerous occasions. Furthermore, {{in the case of}} Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Gaudreault the Federal Court of Appeal has held that such circumvention of technological locks does not constitute copyright infringement. In response, copyright owners lobbied governments to ratify the World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty which was passed in 1996. Article 11 prohibits circumvention of technological locks. Section 47 of bill C-11 attempts to implement Canada’s obligations pursuant to article 11 of the Copyright Treaty. Section 48 would impose criminal sanctions upon persons who circumvent such technological locks.While section 47 of the bill would empower the Governor in Council, via the introduction of section 42.21(2)(a)(iii), to make regulations concerning the suspension of <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumvention</b> of technological locks if same is having an adverse effect on fair dealing, it is uncertain to what extent such provision will be utilized. As a result, otherwise lawful fair dealing with copyrighted works will be prohibited, thereby nullifying fair dealing rights. The Canadian Government has stated that fair dealing and defences will not apply to circumvention of technological locks: “contravention of this prohibition is not an infringement of copyright and the defences to infringement of copyright are not defences to these prohibitions.“ ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the safe harbors and exemptions the statute explicitly provides, [...] requires that the Librarian of Congress issue exemptions from the <b>prohibition</b> against <b>circumvention</b> <b>of</b> access-control technology.

40|$|The ongoing {{transposition}} of the EU Information Society Directive’s {{requirement that}} member States adopt <b>of</b> legal <b>prohibitions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>circumvention</b> <b>of</b> technological protections {{of works of}} authorship occasions this review of international obligations and their implementation in the US. This article addresses the scope of international obligations the WIPO Copyright Treaties impose on member States to protect against circumvention, {{as well as the}} US experience with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act’s <b>prohibitions</b> on <b>circumvention</b> <b>of</b> access and copy controls. It examines the text of the statute, codified at sec. 1201 of the 1976 Copyright Act, the five years of judicial decisions interpreting the statute, and the two administrative proceedings implementing one aspect of the statutory scheme. The analysis of the DMCA and its judicial and administrative interpretation will take up three issues: 1) What technological measures does sec. 1201 protect? 2) What conduct does sec. 1201 prohibit? 3) To what extent does sec. 1201 accommodate copyright exceptions? The US experience to date indicates that legal protection for technological measures has helped foster new business models that make works available to the public at a variety of price points and enjoyment options, without engendering the “digital lockup” and other copyright owner abuses that many had feared. This {{is not to say that}} the US legislation and its judicial interpretation represent the most preferable means to making the internet a hospitable place for authors while continuing to enable lawful user conduct. But brooding forecasts and legitimate continuing concerns notwithstanding, the overall equilibrium so far appears to be a reasonable one...|$|R

The exemption allows jailbreaking of iPhones {{for the sole purpose}} of allowing legally obtained applications to be added to the iPhone. [...] The exemption does not affect the contractual relations between Apple and an iPhone owner, for example, jailbreaking voiding the iPhone warranty; however, it is solely based on Apple's discretion on whether they will fix jailbroken devices in the event that they need to be repaired. At the same time, the Copyright Office exempted unlocking an iPhone from DMCA's anticircumvention prohibitions. [...] Unlocking an iPhone allows the iPhone to be used with any wireless carrier using the same GSM or CDMA technology for which the particular phone model was designed to operate.|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted {{to one of the}} most disputable {{categories}} of jurisprudence – abuse of rights. Modern civil legislation contains many of the assessment law. Interpretation and specification of evaluative concepts is a challenging intellectual process. Abuse of right is a consequence of the process of interpretation of appraisal standards. The law does not allow the exercise of civil rights with the intent to harm another person, as well as abuse of rights in any form, including in the form <b>of</b> <b>circumvention</b> <b>of</b> the law. The author regards as the already known issues with the application of the principle of the inadmissibility of abuse of the right, so new in connection with the amendments to the Civil code of the Russian Federation. In particular the principle of good faith is investigated as a fundamental principle for civil rights. The article {{is devoted to}} the question on the essence and the legal nature <b>of</b> <b>circumvention</b> <b>of</b> the law, as well as the notion <b>of</b> <b>circumvention</b> <b>of</b> the law with unlawful purpose as a form of abuse of right.

The authors have made a conclusion that the correct interpretation of the categories of "subjective property law and protected by law interest" is the key to understanding the notion of abuse of right.

Thus, we will see that according to art. 5 - 9 of the Family Code and to art. 273 - 276 of the Civil Code the impediments to marriage are: 1. {{the existence of a}} previous valid marriage (the state of bigamy); 2. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between blood relatives; 3. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between relatives by adoption; 4. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between the legal tutor and the minor child; 5. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage of the mentally alienated people and of the mentally retarded people; 6. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between the people who suffer from temporary lack of judgment; 7. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> same-sex marriage. However, the provisions in the Civil Code only bring under regulation as an impediment the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between the persons who suffer from temporary lack of judgment.
