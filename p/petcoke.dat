50|$|<b>Petcoke</b> is over 90 percent {{carbon and}} emits 5 to 10 percent more carbon dioxide (CO2) than coal on a per-unit-of-energy basis {{when it is}} burned. As <b>petcoke</b> has a higher energy content, <b>petcoke</b> emits between 30 and 80 percent more CO2 than coal per unit of weight. The {{difference}} between coal and coke in CO2 production per unit energy produced depends upon the moisture in the coal (increases the CO2 per unit energy - heat of combustion) and volatile hydrocarbon in coal and coke (decrease the CO2 per unit energy).|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Gasification of {{carbonaceous}} {{solid fuels}} {{to convert into}} syngas for application of power, liquid fuels and chemicals is practiced worldwide. Coal, biomass and petroleum coke (<b>petcoke)</b> are major feedstock for gasification. <b>Petcoke</b> is a refinery product having high calorific value and low reactivity. The concept of blending of coal/biomass to the low reactive <b>petcoke</b> will make the gasification efficient and profitable and alleviates {{the problems associated with}} <b>petcoke</b> gasification. Co-gasification of <b>petcoke</b> with coal or biomass is advantageous in order to obtain the highest value of products as compared to gasification of <b>petcoke</b> alone. This article reviews the availability of <b>petcoke</b> as gasification feedstock. The challenges in <b>petcoke</b> gasification are indentified. The co-gasification studies are analyzed to understand the advantages of blending the <b>petcoke</b> with coal/biomass for gasification feed. Further, based on gasifier type, co-gasification of <b>petcoke</b> and coal/biomass is analyzed to understand the most efficient process...|$|E
40|$|Petroleum coke, or <b>petcoke,</b> is a {{granular}} coal-like industrial by-product that {{is separated}} during the refinement of heavy crude oil.

The purpose of this literature review is to assess what is known about the effects of <b>petcoke</b> exposure on human health. Toxicological studies in animals indicate that dermal or inhalation <b>petcoke</b> exposure does not lead to a significant risk for cancer development or reproductive and developmental effects. However, pulmonary inflammation was observed in long-term inhalation exposure studies. Epidemiological studies in coke oven workers have shown increased risk for cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, but these studies are confounded by multiple industrial exposures, most notably to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that are generated during <b>petcoke</b> production. The main threat to urban populations in the vicinity of <b>petcoke</b> piles is most likely fugitive dust emissions in the form of fine particulate matter.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{feasibility}} of utilizing petroleum coke as alternative fuel in cement kilns was investigated. The study is a tempt to reduce cost of production in which the fuel represents more than 30 % {{because of the high}} price of fuel oil which ranges between 205 to 215 $ compared with the price of petroleum coke between 40 to 50 $ (FOB). The goal of the study is to optimize process control and alternative fuel consumption while maintaining clinker product quality. The analysis of cost estimation is based on kiln No (3) in Atbara Cement Factory with a design capacity of 750 ton / day. The investigations included the evaluation of <b>petcoke</b> characteristics and advantages through physio – chemical and thermal treatment analysis for sample – 1 (Elsiwez Refinery – Egypt) and sample – 2 (Homs Refinery – Syria). Firing by <b>petcoke</b> required some modifications in the burning system and addition of pulverization mill, storage bunkers, and belt conveyors for grinding <b>petcoke</b> in powder to facilitate flowing through nozzle. The firing can be applied single or dual system to enable operating any of the two systems according to conditions available. The results revealed that : • The metal content in <b>petcoke</b> particularly vanadium and nickel if high causes hard burning and this may be overcomed by fine grinding for <b>petcoke.</b> • The high sulfur content of <b>petcoke</b> may cause operational problems in cement kilns, like blockage of cyclones and also environmental pollution by emissions thus it is necessary to add small dose of raw meal (limestone) to reduce sulfur.

40|$|Gasification of {{petroleum}} coke (<b>Petcoke)</b> {{has emerged in}} the last decades {{as one of the}} attractive options and is gaining more attention to convert <b>petcoke</b> and oil residue to synthesis gas (Syngas). Syngas consists mainly of hydrogen (H 2), carbon monoxide (CO), some other gases, and impurities. In this study, a simulation of Tuscaloosa <b>petcoke,</b> typical gulf coast refineries <b>petcoke,</b> gasification was developed using ASPEN PLUS software. Sensitivity analysis of the simulated model was performed to study the variation in operation conditions of the gasifier such as temperature, pressure, oxygen flow rate, and steam flow rate. The approach correlates the behavior of these parameters with the syngas yield (i. e., H 2, CO, CO 2, H 2 O, CH 4, and H 2 S). Consequently, the desired syngas yield can be obtained by manipulating the gasifier parameters. Implementing optimization calculation shows that up to (81 %) of the gasifier cold gas efficiency (Based on LHV) can be achieved for the developed model. Therefore, Tuscaloosa <b>petcoke</b> gasification under the aforementioned parameters is feasible and can be commercialized. This leads to more utilization of the bottom of oil barrel by upgrading it to more valuable gases with less environmental impacts...|$|E
40|$|Petroleum coke or <b>petcoke,</b> a {{refinery}} byproduct, {{has generally}} been considered as an unusable byproduct because of its high sulfur content. However energy industries now view <b>petcoke</b> as a potential feedstock for power generation because it has higher carbon content than other hydrocarbons like coal, biomass and sewage residue. This gives <b>petcoke</b> a great edge over other feedstocks to generate power. Models for the two most common processes for power generation, namely combustion and gasification, were developed using Aspen Plus steady state chemical process simulator. Overall plant layouts for both processes were developed by calculating the heat and mass balance of the unit operations. After conducting wide sensitivity analysis, results indicate that one ton of <b>petcoke</b> feedstock can generate up to 4 MW of net available power.

40|$|Background: <b>Petcoke</b> is a remmant {{of the oil}} {{refining}} process that contains Ni and other heavy metals. Undesired human exposure to these compounds may result from <b>petcoke</b> combustion in plants located {{in the vicinity of}} the cities. Aim: To compare levels of urinary Ni in schoolchildren residing in cities exposed and not exposed to <b>petcoke</b> pollution. Material and methods: A cross sectional study was done in schoolchildren aged 7 to 8 years old in two cities in northern Chile: Mejillones (n = 59), near to a <b>petcoke</b> plant and Tocopilla (n = 56) as the reference city. First, morning urinary samples were collected and urinary Ni was determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. Socioeconomic and environmental exposure information of families was obtained applying a questionnaire to parents. Multiple linear regression was performed to identify other variables that may explain urinary Ni differences among the cities. Results: Median level of Ni was higher in Mejillones (4. 9 mu g/L) than in Tocopilla (3. 9 mu g/L). Residing in the exposed city was the most important explaining factor (beta = 0. 26; IC 0. 107 - 0. 428). Additionally, years of residency was associated with urinary Ni (beta = 0. 03; IC 0. 004 - 0. 060). Conclusions: Urinary Ni in schoolchildren is higher in the city exposed to <b>petcoke</b> emissions. The difference does not imply that there are concrete hazards for the population's health. However, it warns about the existence of a higher exposure in places where <b>petcoke</b> is used...|$|E
40|$|Conventional passive air {{samplers}} (PAS) {{and passive}} dry deposition (PAS-DD) samplers were deployed along a 90  km south-north transect at five {{sites in the}} Athabasca oil sands region during October to November 2015. The purpose was to compare and characterize {{the performance of the}} two passive sampling methods for targeted compounds across a range of site types. Samples were analyzed for polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAHs), and oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs). ΣPAC and ΣNPAH concentrations were highest in PAS and PAS-DD samplers at site AMS 5, which is the closest sampling site to surface mining and upgrading facilities. The OPAHs were elevated at site AMS 6, which is located in the town of Fort McMurray, approximately 30  km south of the main mining area. The PAS-DD was enriched relative to the PAS in particle associated target chemicals, which is consistent with the relatively more open design of the PAS-DD intended to capture particle- (and gas-phase) deposition. Petroleum coke (<b>petcoke)</b> (i. e. the carbonaceous by-product of bitumen upgrading) and oil sands ore (i. e. the material mined in open pit mines from which bitumen is extracted) were assessed for their potential {{to be a source of}} PACs to air in the oil sands region. The ore samples contained ~  8 times and ~  40 times higher ΣPACs concentrations (dry weight basis) than delayed and fluid <b>petcoke,</b> respectively. The residue analysis of ore and <b>petcoke</b> samples also revealed that the chemical 4 -nitrobiphenyl (4 -NBP) can be used to track gas-phase emissions to air. A comparison of chemical residues in ore, <b>petcoke</b> and air samples revealed that the ore is likely a major contributor to volatile PACs present in air and that both ore and <b>petcoke</b> are contributing to the particle-associated PACs in air near open pit mining areas. The contribution of <b>petcoke</b> particles in passive air samples was also confirmed qualitatively using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy...|$|E

In this paper, the gasification process and the combined cycle are analyzed, considering the implementation of the IGCC technology in the Termobahia power plant. Termobahia is a cogeneration combined cycle power plant, located in the Brazilian state of Bahia that produces 190 MW of electricity and 350 ton/h of steam. The steam produced is sold to an oil refinery (RLAM) located next to it. In first part of this work, the production of the synthesis gas (syngas) from coal gasification was simulated using CeSFaMBiTM software. In the next part, the syngas produced is used to analyze the power plant performance through GateCycleTM software. Finally, the obtained operational and economic parameters are compared with the actual operational parameters of the Termobahia power plant in terms of costs, fuel substitution and combined cycle performance variables, as net power, global efficiency and heat rate...|$|E
