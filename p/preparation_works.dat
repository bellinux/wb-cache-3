The proposed line, which is due to open by September 2017, will transmit electricity at 400 kilovolts from the proposed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. Électricité de France has begun public consultations in respect of the local infrastructure needed for the construction programme to build Hinkley Point C; but, as of January 2011, has not submitted applications for consents for the proposed power stations.
