40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the characteristics of}} flow pattern and vehicle-emitted pollutant dispersion in roughness surface layer. In an urban environment, wind flow and transported-pollutant source interfere strongly with buildings and other roughness elements on the surface ground, which results in complex characteristics of flow pattern and pollutant dispersion in 3 D circumstances. The present study intends to simplify the research domain and investigate the fundamental modeling problems {{that exist in the}} field. The current physical research topic is restricted to 2 D street canyon in equilibrium conditions. The study is motivated by the fact that characteristics of flow pattern and <b>pollutant</b> <b>distribution</b> inside street canyons are important for public health. The research has applied the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology. To date, insights have typically focused on idealized street canyons without strictly limited boundary conditions and turbulence models. Those approaches face challenges related to their applicability to real urban scenarios or the reliability of prediction results. The thesis examines the influence of grid density, turbulence models and turbulent Schmidt number on <b>pollutant</b> <b>distribution</b> at windward and leeward surfaces of street canyon. Since numerical results usually are validated with wind-tunnel measurement data, the results between full-size model and wind-tunnel model are compared in order to test the Reynolds number effect. The lack of measurement data means that the morphometric method is used to generate upcoming wind profile, including the mean vertical velocity and turbulence parameters. The thesis also {{analyzes the}} potential errors brought by the method (Scenario A). Based on the evaluated numerical model, the thesis continues to study the impacts of surrounding buildings and geometry of street canyon on flow and <b>pollutant</b> <b>distribution</b> inside street canyons. The effect of wind on <b>pollutant</b> <b>distribution</b> inside street canyons was also investigated (Scenario A). Furthermore, the influence of roof shape and configuration of street canyon on characteristics of flow and <b>pollutant</b> <b>distribution</b> is also systematically studied, with the results shown in scenario B. The main conclusions of the thesis are that the uncertainty of numerical results derives from different aspects. Wind profile in the inlet profile generated by morphometric method brings major error to the simulation results. Current turbulence models cannot compromise the simulation results between flow field and <b>pollutant</b> <b>distribution</b> field. Ignored small-scale obstacles also need to be handled carefully. Numerical results revealed that flow and <b>pollutant</b> <b>distribution</b> inside street canyons are mainly dominated by the geometry of the street canyon itself. Medium-spaced surrounding buildings are also better able to transport pollutant out of the street canyon. Through systematic analysis, roof shape is proven to {{have a significant effect on}} flow and <b>pollutant</b> <b>distribution</b> inside a street canyon. The major impact is altered turbulence intensity depth and strength of shear layer inside the street canyon, which is important for pollutant removal process out of the street canyon. In the future, advanced turbulence models accompanied by small-obstacle effect models need to be developed in order to reliably simulate flow and pollutant dispersion simultaneously. Based on the advanced turbulence model, simulation of flow and pollutant dispersion in a complex 3 D environment is essential in the next steps for the purpose of engineering application. Accurate vertical wind profile provided for inlet profile is another interesting direction for further development.

40|$|This article {{proposes to}} deploy {{a group of}} mobile sensor agents to cover a {{polluted}} region {{so that they are}} able to retrieve the <b>pollutant</b> <b>distribution.</b> The deployed mobile sensor agents are capable of making point observation in the natural environment. There are two approaches to modelling the <b>pollutant</b> <b>distribution</b> proposed in this article. One is a model-based approach where the sensor agents sample environmental pollutant, build up an environmental pollutant model and move towards the region where high density pollutant exists. The modelling technique used is a distributed support vector regression and the motion control technique used is a distributed locational optimising algorithm (centroidal Voronoi tessellation). The other is a model-free approach where the sensor agents sample environmental pollutant and directly move towards the region where high density pollutant exists without building up a model. The motion control technique used is a bacteria chemotaxis behaviour. By combining this behaviour with a flocking behaviour, it is possible to form a spatial distribution matched to the underlying <b>pollutant</b> <b>distribution.</b> Both approaches are simulated and tested with a group of real robots. © 2011 Taylor & Francis...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} airflow motions and associated <b>pollutant</b> <b>distributions</b> in fume hoods. Currently, most exhaust fume hoods are designed to use an airflow induced by a fan at the top to remove pollutants. Ambient fluids are drawn, flowing toward the opening and subsequently turning to the outlet at the roof. Pollutants are supposedly captured by the airflow and brought out from the cupboard. The present numerical study based on the finite-volume method and the standard k–e turbulence model simulates flow patterns and <b>pollutant</b> <b>distributions</b> in an exhaust fume hood with and without a manikin present. Subsequently, a push–pull air curtain technique is applied to a fume cupboard. To investigate the capturing performance of a push–pull fume cupboard, numerical approaches are used to simulate flow and concentration variations. Numerical results reveal that four characteristic flow modes exist for a variety of speed ratios of push–pull flows and openings. A concave curtain mode which has a fast pull flow and a weak push flow is suggested for the operation of a push–pull fume cup-board. According to ANSI-ASHRAE Standard 110 - 1995, the local concentration at the speci-fied point is < 0. 1 parts per million (p. p. m.). Meanwhile, we also examine concentration variations at 12 selected points in front of the sash, and all where the concentration is < 0. 1 p. p. m. A manikin is put in front of the sash to observe its effect. As a result, the flow and the concentration contours in a push–pull fume cupboard are not affected by a manikin. In terms of those predicted results, it turns out that a push–pull fume cupboard successfully captures pollutants and prevents an operator from breathing pollutants...|$|R
