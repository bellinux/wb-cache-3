5|$|Britain, {{which had}} {{concluded}} in 1892 {{that it needed}} twice as many cruisers as any potential enemy to adequately <b>protect</b> <b>its</b> empire's sea lanes, responded to the perceived threat by laying down its own large armoured cruisers. Between 1899 and 1905, it completed or laid down seven classes of this type, a total of 35 ships. This building program, in turn, prompted the French and Russians to increase their own construction. The Imperial German Navy began to build large armoured cruisers for use on their overseas stations, laying down eight between 1897 and 1906.|$|E

The Army Corps of Engineers operates 13 such dams, which affect flows from about 40percent of the basin. Most {{of them do not}} have fish ladders.|$|E

5|$|The {{tawny owl}} or brown owl (Strix aluco) is a stocky, {{medium-sized}} owl {{commonly found in}} woodlands across much of Eurasia.

The nest is typically in a tree hole where it can <b>protect</b> <b>its</b> eggs and young against potential predators. This owl is non-migratory and highly territorial.

5|$|Common {{threshers}} are active, strong swimmers; {{there are}} infrequent reports of them leaping {{completely out of}} the water. Like the fast-swimming sharks of the family Lamnidae, the common thresher has a strip of aerobic red muscle along its flank that is able to contract powerfully and efficiently for long periods of time. In addition, they have slow-oxidative muscles centrally located within their bodies and a blood vessel countercurrent exchange system called the rete mirabile ("wonderful net"), allowing them to generate and retain body heat. The temperature inside the red muscles of a common thresher averages 2°C (3.6°F) above that of the ambient seawater, though there is significant individual variation. Unlike the pelagic and bigeye threshers, the common thresher lacks an orbital rete mirabile to <b>protect</b> <b>its</b> eyes and brain from temperature changes.|$|E
