Pull style machines are basically vertical machines laid on the side with a longer stroke.

50|$|In {{tempered}} glasses, air jets {{are used}} to rapidly cool {{the top and bottom}} surfaces of a softened (hot) slab of glass. Since the surface cools quicker, there is more free volume at the surface than in the bulk melt. The core of the slab then <b>pulls</b> the <b>surface</b> inward, resulting in an internal compressive stress at the surface. This substantially increases the tensile strength of the material as tensile stresses exerted on the glass must now resolve the compressive stresses before yielding.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{influences}} of low frequency magnetic field and {{static magnetic field}} on the air film casting process are studied in this paper. 6063 aluminum alloy ingot of 174 -mm diameter were produced by electromagnetic air film casting process; intensity of the coil current is from 50 to 200 A, and frequency is from 15 to 30 Hz. The results showed that low-frequency magnetic fields can speed up the flow of liquid metal in sump and the air film stability was undermined, leading to folds and segregations appeared on the ingot surface.

30|$|Deformation {{component}} {{is associated with}} local elastic deformation of solids under conditions of elastohydrodynamic lubrication, while adhesive component {{can be considered as}} a worsening factor appearing when direct contact of bodies become inevitable due to lubricant film failure. In typical situations, adhesive force is many orders of magnitude larger than the deformation component, so most research work is concentrated on the search for methods of minimizing adhesive component of the friction force. Nevertheless, treatment of a friction process as a mixture of elastohydrodynamic and boundary lubrication regime is not complete. It is usually assumed that for elastohydrodynamic lubrication regime hydraulic pressure of lubricant equals to contact stresses [1 – 3], which might not be the case in reality. The main condition for elastohydrodynamic regime is continuity of lubricant during flow over contact, but this condition is not satisfied in many experiments because cavitation at the contact exit is quite a common effect [1, 4, 5]. Cavitation {{is the result of the}} so-called negative pressure conditions, when liquid pressure becomes much lower than the atmospheric value, and fast decompression releases stored gases. The occurrence of cavitation is a direct evidence that hydraulic pressure in the contact zone is not necessarily higher than the pressure in the outside regions, but instead could be much lower than the external pressure. Suction produced by lowered pressure put additional strain on sliding bodies and causes adverse effect on friction because it <b>pulls</b> <b>surfaces</b> towards each other. We believe that such decompressive mechanism of friction really happens in practice and should be considered along with deformation and adhesive force components. Thus, current theory of friction should be extended and include force components associated with decompression to match experimental data.|$|R
3000|$|... dr. Autocorrelation of {{roughness}} model {{shows that}} the inner surface {{does not have any}} orientation tendency and is not affected by <b>pulling</b> direction. <b>Surface</b> roughness parameters of pipette tips have significant influence on many applications, especially when pipettes are used in contact with vulnerable biological samples, for example, in patch-clamping experiments. Single-channel currents recorded from HUVECs cells show significantly lower noise and leakage current for pipettes polished by FIB milling. This enhancement accounts for better contact conditions of polished pipettes and the fact that polished pipettes do not have valleys and voids which facilitate current leakage in the patch-clamping. The results of this study can be used to explain some observations in laboratory practice. For example, smaller pipettes make better seals because smaller pipettes have lower S [...]...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the final}} steps in {{fabricating}} microelectromechanical devices often involves a liquid etch release process. Capillary forces during the liquid evaporation stage after the wet etch process can <b>pull</b> two <b>surfaces</b> together resulting in adhesion of suspended microstructures to the supporting substrate. This release related adhesion can greatly reduce yields. In this report, a wet etch release method that uses polystyrene microspheres in the final rinse liquid is investigated. The polystyrene microspheres act as physical barriers between the substrate and suspended microstructures during the final liquid evaporation phase. A plasma ashing process is utilized to completely remove the polystyrene microspheres from the microstructure surfaces. Using this process, release yields > 90 % were achieved. It is found that the surface roughness of gold surfaces increases while that of the silicon is reduced due to a thin oxide that grows on the silicon surface during the plasma process...|$|R

40|$|Recent seismological {{measurements}} of the Pacific oceanic structure have detected a positive correspondence between surface topography, seismic wave speed, and the geoid (gravitational potential). High seismic wave speed indicates cold material sinking, which <b>pulls</b> the <b>surface</b> downward. Thus, topographic lows are expected to correlate with seismic wave speed highs, contrary to the new seismic measurements. We propose models which include two segregated materials, representing the fertile upper mantle and the residue from crustal melting, in order to decouple the surface topography from subsurface convection and create {{a positive correlation between}} topography and wave speed. We add a low viscosity zone beneath the residue to enhance the density contribution to the geoid anomaly and ensure that its sign is in phase with that of the surface topography and wave speed. Our models produce surface topography and geoid anomalies comparable to the recent seismological measurements. These models offer constraint...|$|R

A similar approach can be used to make pressure-sensing foams [5]. Others have studied the strain sensing mechanism in more detail and have shown that two effects are important. In one case, cracking of the surface layer on conducting polymer on a fabric leads to a reduction in conductivity as the fabric is stretched [6, 7].
