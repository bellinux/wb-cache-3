40|$|It is now {{increasingly}} common to extend private workstations with large public displays into a shared multi-display environment. Mouse-based interaction across multiple displays provides a convenient way to quickly shift between private {{work on the}} personal monitor and tightly coupled collaboration on shared display spaces. However, mouse <b>pointer</b> <b>navigation</b> can be negatively influenced by display factors in the environment and thereby limits fluid interaction across displays. In this paper, we present experiences with mouse-controlled multi-display environments. Based on an experiment comparing four mouse <b>pointer</b> <b>navigation</b> techniques, we show limitations of mouse-controlled interaction in multi-display environments and suggest improvements to enhance the user interface experience with low-cost multi-display settings...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCurrent {{freehand}} {{interactions with}} large displays rely on point & select {{as the dominant}} paradigm. However, constant hand movement in air for <b>pointer</b> <b>navigation</b> leads to hand fatigue quickly. We introduce summon & select, a new model for freehand interaction where, instead of navigating to the control, the user summons it into focus and then manipulates it. Summon & select solves the problems of constant <b>pointer</b> <b>navigation,</b> need for precise selection, and out-of-bounds gestures that plague point & select. We describe the design and conduct two studies to evaluate the design and compare it against point & select in a multi-button selection study. The results show that summon & select is significantly faster and has less physical and mental demand than point & select...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the multi-display {{environment}} Deskotheque, which combines personal and tiled projected displays into a continuous teamspace. Its main distinguishing factor is a fine-grained spatial (i. e., both geometric and topological) {{model of the}} display layout. Using this model, Deskotheque allows seamless mouse <b>pointer</b> <b>navigation</b> and application window sharing across the multi-display environment. Geometric compensation of casually aligned multi-projector displays supports {{a wide range of}} display configurations. Mouse pointer redirection and window migration are tightly integrated into the windowing system, while geometric compensation of projected imagery is accomplished by a 3 D compositing window manager. Thus, Deskotheque provides sharing of unmodified desktop application windows across display and workstation boundaries without compromising hardware-accelerated rendering of 2 D or 3 D content on projected tiled displays with geometric compensation...|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{suitability}} of speech recognition for navigating within a window system and we describe Xspeak, an iinpleinentation of voice control for the X Window System. We made this interface available {{to a number of}} student programmers, ancl compared the use of speech and a <b>pointer</b> for window <b>navigation</b> through empirical and observational means. Our experience indicates that speech was attractive for some users, and we coininent on their activities and recognition accuracy. These observations reveal pitfalls and advantages of using speech input in wiilclows systems...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} element of UAV equipment are observation heads. Observation head is multisensor optoelectronic system. It includes TV camera and infrared camera, safe for the eye rangefinder and laser <b>pointer</b> and a <b>navigation</b> system GPS. Image stability is provided by electro-mechanical gyro stability system. Optoelectronic head are designed for use in systems of detection, identification and observation of ground and air targets and in daylight and at night. In this paper simulation studies of the air masses flow around the observation head placed on the UAV deck, for different speeds of UAV movement were conducted. The results of numerical research were presented in a graphical form...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{fingerprint}} detection {{technology that}} supports <b>navigation,</b> <b>pointer,</b> and fingerprint acquisition is described. The hybrid system {{consists of a}} silicon sensor substrate flip-chipped onto a mixed-signal ASIC. The sensor is linear and the finger is swiped over to scan the fingerprint. The <b>navigation</b> and <b>pointer</b> functions {{are based on the}} motion detection of the finger on the substrate sensor. Stroking and tapping the sensor substrate surface with the finger determines movement of the cursor and clicking-like mouse. To achieve 500 dpi fingerprint detection accuracy, separate process optimization for both the ASIC and the sensor substrate gives an alternative solution compared with all other silicon sensor approaches. The ASIC is 18 mm 2 in 0. 25 - m CMOS and the sensor is 105 mm 2. Index Terms—CMOS ac capacitive fingerprint sensors, hybrid biometric system, <b>navigation</b> and <b>pointer</b> functions, intelligent sen-sors, mixed analog–digital integrated circuits. I...|$|R
40|$|The limited size of {{the nose}} leads to {{frequent}} instrument changes in navigated endonasal sinus surgery. Tracked instruments provide limited accuracy, and the <b>pointer</b> gives no <b>navigation</b> information during tissue removal. To overcome information loss, laser triangulation was integrated into navigation information. Accuracy and reliability of the laser-assisted distance-measuring system were evaluated within the distance of 0 and 20 mm. System accuracy of the laser endoscope was compared with a standard pointer using registration via bone screws and surface matching. Accuracy of the laser was 0. 12 mm ± 0. 12 mm with a reliability of 0. 2 mm. The system accuracy of the laser endoscope was 0. 59 mm ± 0. 16 mm using bone screw registration and 0. 64 mm ± 0. 22 mm using surface matching. Additionally, laser endoscope is more accurate compared with the pointer using bone screw registration. Overall, navigation information was successfully integrated into an endoscope by laser triangulation with encouraging results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. XML {{has become}} the {{standard}} format for data representation and exchange in domains ranging from the Web to desktop applications. However, wide adoption of XML is hindered by inefficient document-parsing methods. Recent work on lazy parsing is a major step towards alleviating this problem. However, lazy parsers must still read the entire XML document in order to extract the overall document structure, {{due to the lack}} of internal <b>navigation</b> <b>pointers</b> inside XML documents. Further, these parsers must load and parse the entire virtual document tree into memory during XML query processing. These overheads significantly degrades the performance of navigation operations. We have developed a framework for efficient XML parsing based on the idea of placing internal physical pointers within the document, which allows skipping large portions of the document during parsing. The internal pointers are generated in a way that optimizes parsing for common navigation patterns. A double-Lazy Parser (2 LP) is then used to parse the document that exploits the internal pointers. To create the internal pointers, we use constructs supported by the current W 3 C XML standard. We study our pointer generation and parsing algorithms both theoretically and experimentally, and show that they perform considerably better than existing approaches...|$|R
40|$|Intraoperative {{navigation}} {{is frequently}} {{used to assess}} the position of the implant in orbital reconstruction. Interpretation of the feedback from the navigation system to a three-dimensional position of the implant needs to be done by the surgeon, and feedback is only gathered after the implant has been positioned. An implant-oriented navigation approach is proposed, with real-time intuitive feedback during insertion. A technical framework was set up for implant-oriented navigation, with requirements for planning, implant tracking, and feedback. A dedicated navigation instrument was designed and a software tool was developed {{in order to meet the}} technical requirements. An accuracy study was performed to investigate the accuracy of the method in comparison to the regular <b>navigation</b> <b>pointer.</b> A proof of concept was provided. The results showed a translation error of 1. 12 - 1. 15 mm for implant-oriented navigation with regular registration (pointer 0. 71 - 0. 98 mm) and 0. 81 mm with accurate registration (pointer 0. 54 mm). Rotational error was found to be small (< 3 °). Quantitative and intuitive qualitative feedback could be provided to the surgeon in real-time during insertion of an orbital implant. Following this proof of concept and accuracy study, the implications for the clinical workflow should be evaluated. An implant-oriented approach may form the foundation for augmented reality or robotic-aided implant insertio...|$|R
