40|$|In this work, {{modifications}} {{have been}} done on a prototype <b>pneumatic</b> <b>separator</b> to improve its effi-ciency. The effects of the modifications were studied by carrying out performance test analyses on the two blowers and reciprocating sieve mechanism which make up the critical components of the separating machine. The variations in the feed weights of the sieve were analysed {{to determine the best}} and most effective screening process. Also, the best and least tilt angles of the blowers were considered to determine the best and least blowing processes to clean the beans. The results of analyses showed that for a feed weight of 3. 0 kg the sieving process attained its best efficiency of 50. 2 %. The maximum efficiency of 79. 2 % for the first <b>pneumatic</b> <b>separator</b> was obtained at a tilt angle of 30 o, while a maximum of 77. 7 % was obtained for the second separator at 0 o tilt angle. An overall efficiency of 77 % was estimated for the modified <b>pneumatic</b> <b>separator...</b>|$|E
40|$|With the {{development}} of the Saturn launch vehicle, it became mandatory to develop a system for restraining the vehicle until after all checks and engine thrust buildup were completed. The basic Saturn I holddown arm constrains the vehicle by clamping it between a fixed support and a movable jaw. The jaw is on a link pinned to rotate sufficiently to release the vehicle. There are three links in the jaw (restraining) system arranged so that with a small force provided by a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>separator</b> mechanism, the large loads of the vehicle can be restrained. Design details discussed are the link system, the separator, adjustments, and the energy absorber. The function of preloading is discussed. The secondary release system is described. Finally, the design differences between the Saturn I and the Saturn V arm are described...|$|E
40|$|Basic {{dimensions}} (length, {{width and}} thickness), critical velocity of transporting seeds, sliding friction angle {{and the mass}} of pumpkin seeds, obtained from four fruit of various mass were determined. Based on the measurements, volume and thickness of each seed and its spherical index were calculated. Interdependence between the tested properties and indexes was evaluated based on the test for independ-ent samples, analyses of variance, correlation and regression. It {{was found that the}} seeds mass is the most variable property and their length is the least variable. Empty and full pumpkin seeds should be separated with a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>separator,</b> where a vertical air stream of velocity approx. 5 m·s- 1 is a separating element. Length and mass of seeds may be used at separation of seed material into quality frac-tions. As a result of separating the smallest seed fraction, a seed material may be obtained in which after the process of removing the fruit-seed coat, 95 % of ripe seeds will be available...|$|E

30|$|Application of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>separators</b> in coal {{beneficiation}} {{is increasing}} rapidly {{over the last}} decade primarily due to their low capital and operating costs, and waste handling problems associated with traditional wet processing methods. Large amount of shale/rock that is extracted in coal production can be removed prior to transportation at the mine face by using this methodology. Due to the limited washing facilities in India, most of the thermal power plants burn raw coal from run-of-mine (ROM) to generate electricity. This practice causes poor utilization efficiency, high operating and maintenance costs, and high emission rates for the power plants. One potential method that can be utilized is the air-fluidized inclined vibrating deck technology. The technology was demonstrated on a pilot-scale at different coal washeries in India at a feed rate of 5 -ton per hour. The pilot-scale evaluation showed that 20  %– 25  % high-ash incombustible material can be eliminated from ROM feed with only minor losses in energy content (< 10  %) from respective ROM coal. Furthermore, a feasibility analysis showed significant economic gains in terms of transportation cost, improving power-plant efficiency, and reducing emissions rates by using the technology.|$|R
40|$|Summary. The paper {{presents}} an infl uence of air stream fl ow rates in a modifi ed separator with vertical air stream on purifi cation and separation of selected grain mixture. An {{analysis of the}} obtained data on vertical air stream fl ow intensity revealed great variability of grain separation and purifi cation effi ciency. It was found that both air stream intensity and the way and rate of mixture supply into the working area of the separator had the largest infl uence on the course and effi ciency of particular mixture components separation (particularly of light substances). It was observed that precise regulation of air stream fl ow and its wide variability range allowed for an achievement of very good results of purifi cation and separation of the studied grain mixture. The obtained effects resulted in a positive evaluation of the proposed construction of laboratory separator with vertical air stream for effi cient separation of particular components of grain mixture.

40|$|In {{the process}} of {{pneumatic}} separation we use as separating characteristics aerodynamic properties of particles, their critical velocity being the characteristic value. The investigations were carried out on a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>separator</b> whose design enabled {{a wide range of}} regulations of parameters. Based on the study results the essential fa- ctors that affected the course of the process were identified and the theoretical correlation between them, deciding about the efficacy of pneumatic separation, were determined. The main aim {{of the study was to}} analyse the separation process in an air stream of broken-up lupine seeds, chiefly involving theoretical considerations of movement and behaviour of mixture particles in a pneumatic canal. Investigations and observations gave ground for an attempt at determining a deriving a movement equation of particles in an unrestrained, uniform air stream. The equations obtained can be used for calculating the parameters of particle movement in pneumatic canals. The velocities of air stream, then, can be a few times higher than the critical velocity /convection/ of individual particles. While working out the above problems there were consi-dered, on the one hand possibilities of obtaining the greatest effectiveness of the separation process, and on the other, the smallest possible losses of valuable material in the discard-ed lot...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the process}} of {{pomegranate}} arils pneumatic separation, the aerodynamic characteristics of pomegranate aril, rind and locular septa are essential. The main {{aim of this study}} was to measure and compare the aerodynamic characteristics of these materials to provide the data and to facilitate the design and adjustment of machines that perform separation of pomegranate arils from rind and locular septa based on aerodynamic characteristics (terminal velocity, drag coefficient and Reynolds number). To achieve this objective, Ashraf variety pomegranate fruit during its maturity stages was studied. The obtained results showed that the variation in maturity stage significantly influenced the terminal velocity, drag coefficient and Reynolds number (P< 0. 05). During the fruit maturity, the terminal velocity of locular septa, rind and pomegranate aril increased from 1. 05 to 1. 16, 3. 16 to 3. 73 and 5. 89 to 6. 70 ms− 1, respectively. The corresponding value of drag coefficient of the three studied materials decreased from 0. 92 to 0. 79, 0. 75 to 0. 59 and 0. 53 to 0. 36, respectively with advancing fruit maturity. Also these ranges for Reynolds number were 403. 24 – 617. 75, 1213. 44 – 1986. 37 and 2261. 76 – 3568. 02, respectively. Consequently, aerodynamic separation of pomegranate aril from locular septa and rind is theoretically possible if the air velocity value is adjusted according to the terminal velocity of pomegranate aril. Also the obtained equations can be used for calculating the parameters of pomegranate aril movement in pneumatic tunnels or in the design and development of air conveyor and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>separator</b> of pomegranate aril...|$|E
