5|$|Congregation is {{the third}} studio album by American {{alternative}} rock band The Afghan Whigs, released on January 31, 1992, by Sub Pop. After touring {{for two years in}} support of their 1990 album Up in It, the band received $15,000 advance from Sub <b>Pop</b> <b>to</b> record a follow-up album. It was primarily recorded at Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville and Buzz's Kitchen in Los Angeles during July to August 1991. The band's frontman Greg Dulli produced the album entirely with audio engineer Ross Ian Stein. The album's production and release were hindered by Sub Pop's financial difficulties, which were eventually resolved by the massive commercial success of Nirvana's 1991 album Nevermind.|$|E

25|$|The {{seeds of}} Pop's stage persona were sown {{when he saw}} The Doors perform in 1967 at the University of Michigan and was amazed by the stage antics and {{antagonism}} displayed by singer Jim Morrison. Morrison's extreme behavior, while performing in a popular band, inspired the young <b>Pop</b> <b>to</b> push the boundaries of stage performance. Other influences on Pop's vocals and persona were Mick Jagger and James Brown. Pop was the first performer to do a stage-dive, which he started at a concert in Detroit. Pop, who traditionally performs bare-chested, also performed such stage theatrics as rolling around in broken glass and exposing himself to the crowd.|$|E

She returned to the UK with a record-breaking run of performances at the Talk of the Town nightclub. Also that year, her album Something was released, and showcased a new Bassey style, a shift from traditional <b>pop</b> <b>to</b> more contemporary songs and arrangements (the eponymous single was more successful in the UK charts than the original recording by The Beatles) – although Bassey would never completely abandon what that had been her forte: standards, show tunes, and torch songs.|$|E
25|$|Though music critics noted Amuro's {{evolution}} from <b>pop</b> <b>to</b> R, the mid-2000s saw {{a decline in}} sales, both albums and singles. Play (2007), her eighth studio album, {{was a period of}} resurgence in Japanese music for her. Eventually, she moved onto electronic dance music and English language with follow-up records Uncontrolled (2012) and Feel (2013); her eleventh studio album, Genic (2015), is her last studio album, whereas Finally (2017) will be her final overall release of her career. While some parts of her career gained her credit as a songwriter and producer, Amuro has mainly been a studio and touring artist, with many of her releases reaching number-one in Japan. Aside from music, she has appeared on various advertisement campaigns in Japan and worked as a entrepreneur with her own management company, Stella88 and her own record label, Dimension Point.|$|E
