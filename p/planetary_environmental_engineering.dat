40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{university}} degree in <b>Environmental</b> <b>Engineering</b> {{as a part of}} university studies in Engineering and shows engineering fields in which <b>environmental</b> <b>engineering</b> studies have been established as stand-alone studies globally. Furthermore, the paper gives a short overview of <b>environmental</b> <b>engineering</b> education in Slovenia, and then looks in detail at the integration of <b>environmental</b> <b>engineering</b> studies with study programmes offered at the Faculty of Civil and Geodetic Engineering, University of Ljubljana. In 1998, the first ever in Slovenia technical studies in <b>environmental</b> <b>engineering</b> were introduced, i. e. the four-year university study Water Management and Communal Engineering (VKI). In 2009, it was transformed into a new two-stage Bologna study programme Water Management and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Engineering</b> (VOI). The paper presents the basic indicators of the VKI studies (enrolment, graduates, average grades, study duration, drop-out), which formally expires in the academic year 2015 / 16, and compares them with those of the pre-Bologna university study programme in geodetic engineering. 15 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Due to the climatic {{changes and}} the {{ecological}} variations of the biosphere, global natural resources including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, biodiversities, genetic resources and energy, radiation, electric charge and magnetism, must be safeguarded {{for the benefit of}} present and future generations through careful planning and management as appropriate. Approach: The main points of the International Council of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Engineering</b> Education (ICEEE) are to enhance services to its members, work with educational and research institutions to improve <b>environmental</b> <b>engineering</b> education and technology and promote the undergraduate university degree (B. Sc.), graduate higher degree (M. Sc.) and Ph. D. development, facilitate productive cooperation among industry, academy and government, enhance the participation and success of under-represented groups in the <b>environmental</b> <b>engineering</b> education enterprise, promote the value of the engineering profession, unify the <b>environmental</b> <b>engineering</b> education programs throughout the World Countries and exchange the <b>environmental</b> <b>engineering</b> education professionalism among international institutions. Results: Based on the above mentioned concepts, the Obuda University, Rejto Sandor Faculty of Light Industry and <b>Environmental</b> Protection <b>Engineering</b> (Budapest, Hungary), the Technical University of Kosice, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (Kosice, Slovakia), Uzhhorod National University, Faculty of Chemistry at the (Uzhhorod, Ukraine), Polytechnic Engineering College of Subotica and the UNESCO Chair in Water Resources-Sudan (UNESCO-CWR) agreed to establish an international organization dealing with <b>environmental</b> <b>engineering</b> education management. Conclusion: The dynamic development of our professional reforms and combined with effective use of scientific potentials agreed to improve the standards of <b>environmental</b> <b>engineering</b> education. Our institutions are agreed to fund and serve as the premier multidisciplinary council for individuals and organizations committed to promote all aspects of <b>environmental</b> <b>engineering</b> and engineering technology education.
