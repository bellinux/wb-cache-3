Most important are the introduction of two new classes of treatments: topical vitamin D(3) analogues and the retinoid tazarotene. To what extent, however, have we achieved developments which {{are in line with}} the needs as expressed by the patients? Improved efficacy has been realized by successful combinations of topical treatments. In particular, the combinations of dithranol, vitamin D(3) and tazarotene with a topical corticosteroid proved to be very effective with a reduced profile of side-effects. The efficacy of vitamin D(3) analogues and tazarotene is such that the efficacy of a potent corticosteroid (betamethasone- 17 -valerate) is approached; calcipotriol even showed an efficacy which is at least as good as this corticosteroid. The long-term safety of new compounds has been evaluated for at least 12 months in large studies. Remarkably for corticosteroids such information is available for only 12 weeks. However, intermittent applications of a topical corticosteroid in combination with another topical treatment provide an effective and safe long-term control of psoriasis.

40|$|Quantum {{field theory}} (QFT) poses a {{challenge}} to the orthodox methodological framework of the philosophy of science. The first step of investigating a physical theory, it is commonly assumed, is to specify some mathematical structures which constitute its formalism. In the case of QFT however this is a highly non-trivial task. There are a variety of prima facie distinct formulations of the theory: most strikingly, there is a gulf between the axiomatic formulations of QFT developed by mathematical physicists and the formalisms employed in mainstream high energy physics. In recent years this has led to debate about which version of the theory those interested in the foundations of physics ought to be looking at. This thesis offers a response to this problem. I argue that we should abandon the search for a single canonical formulation of QFT and instead take a more pluralistic stance which allows that different strands of the QFT programme may be appropriate starting points for addressing different philosophical questions. The overarching claim of the thesis is that, while the axiomatic approach to QFT may be the right framework for addressing some internal question raised by the QFT <b>programme,</b> <b>formulations</b> of QFT which incorporate cutoffs on the allowed momentum states can express all of the claims that we have any reason to believe {{on the basis of the}} empirical successes of high energy physics. In the course of this discussion I offer new perspectives on foundational issues like the status of relativity and unitarily inequivalent representations in QFT. Furthermore, I suggest that QFT and high energy physics offer fruitful grounds for discussing broader issues in the philosophy of science, and in particular the challenge of formulating a viable version of scientific realism...|$|R

The 145 participants were divided into 14 groups (M = 10 participants) by community and randomly assigned to 14 community-based trained facilitators. Each facilitator administered Dunker’s (2001) KAP tool for hygiene to the assigned group. The responses from all the groups were collated and analysed.

40|$|Background: Cause-specific {{mortality}} statistics are primary evidence for health policy <b>formulation,</b> <b>programme</b> evaluation, and epidemiological research. In Turkey, a partially functioning vital registration system {{in urban areas}} yields fragmentary evidence on levels and causes of mortality. This article discusses the application of innovative methods to develop national mortality estimates in Turkey, and their implications for national health development policies. Methods: Child mortality levels from the Demography and Health Survey (DHS) were applied to model life tables to estimate age-specific death rates. Reported causes of death from urban areas were adjusted using re-distribution algorithms from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study. Rural cause structure was estimated from epidemiological models. Local epidemiological data was used to adjust model-based estimates. Results: Life expectancy at birth in 2000 {{was estimated to be}} 67. 7 years (males) and 71. 9 years (females), about 8 – 10 years lower than in Western Europe. Leading causes of death include major vascular diseases (ischaemic heart disease, stroke) causing 35 – 38 % of deaths, chronic obstructive lung disease and lung cancer in men, but also perinatal causes, lower respiratory infections and diarrhoeal diseases. Injuries cause about 6 – 8 % of deaths, although this may be an underestimate. Conclusions: Mortality estimates are uncertain in Turkey, given the poor quality of death registration systems.

The background to the bus crew scheduling problem 1 S described and the existing literature on methods for solution is reviewed. In IMPACS, the crew scheduling problem is formulated as an integer linear <b>programme</b> using a <b>formulation</b> which is an extension of set covering; a very large set of possible duties is generated, from which the duties forming the schedule are selected in such a way as to minimise the total cost. The variables of the set covering problem correspond to the duties generated and the constraints to the pieces of work in the bus schedule. For realistic schedules, it is impossible to generate all legal duties, and there are often too many pieces of work to allow each one to give rise to a constraint. IMPACS contains several heuristic methods which reduce the set covering problem to a manageable size, while still allowing good quality schedules to be compiled. Techniques for speeding up the solution of the set covering problem have been investigated, and in particular a branching strategy which exploits features of the crew scheduling problem has been developed. ...|$|R

The aim was to further elucidate the cytotoxicity of a selected pDMAEMA low molecular weight (MW) polymer against human U 937 monocytes and Caco- 2 intestinal epithelial cells using a novel multi-parameter high content analysis (HCA) assay and to investigate histological effects on isolated rat intestinal mucosae. Seven parameters of cytotoxicity were measured: nuclear intensity (NI), nuclear area (NA), intracellular calcium ([Ca 2 +]i), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), plasma membrane permeability (PMP), cell number (CN) and phospholipidosis. Histological effects of pDMAEMA on excised rat ileal and colonic mucosae were investigated in Ussing chambers. Following 24 - 72 hours exposure, 25 - 50 µg/ml pDMAEMA induced necrosis in U 937 cells, while 100 - 250 µg/ml induced apoptosis in Caco- 2. pDMAEMA increased NA and NI and decreased [Ca 2 +]i, PMP, MMP and CN in U 937 cells. In Caco- 2, it increased NI and [Ca 2 +]i, but decreased NA, PMP, MMP and CN. Phospholipidosis was not observed in either cell line. pDMAEMA (10 mg/ml) did not induce any histological damage on rat colonic tissue and only mild damage to ileal tissue following exposure for 60 min.

It is important for environmental education initiatives to challenge views currently held by policy makers, planners and enforcement agencies as well as to complement their knowledge base so as to promote better planning and management. Both Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) and gender are sorely neglected factors in decision making and policy formulation. This may be attributed to many factors including Zimbabwe's political history, existing gender relations, the institutional framework and the planning and managerial framework. This paper examines the significance of gender and IKS in the creation of such strategies. It seeks to locate rural women in the development scenario and to specifically identify their interests and values. Thus, it explores the relationship of rural women to knowledge systems and defines them as critical stakeholders...|$|E
40|$|As {{with many}} {{developing}} countries, the consumer macrostructure of South Africa is beset {{with a number}} of serious problems including high levels of poverty, a very unequal income distribution, negative personal saving rates and high personal gearing ratios. A consumer financial vulnerability study conducted in 2009 showed that South Africans are generally financially vulnerable, thus confirming these problems in the consumer macrostructure and suggested various reasons for the existence of such problems. The question could be asked regarding the reasons for such problems in South Africa given the economic progress that has been made during the post-apartheid era. In order to identify the reasons for the said problems, this paper will focus on the endogenous and exogenous predictors of financial vulnerability in South Africa, which could be derived from the said consumer financial vulnerability survey. Predictors of consumer financial vulnerability uncovered by this study include, inter alia, endogenous predictors such as over-indebtedness, bad financial planning, consumers spending more that they earn. Exogenous factors include adverse economic conditions, age and population group. In the analyses that were conducted for this paper, the usual econometric diagnostics (i. e. co-linearity, autocorrelation and underindentification) of postulated relationships were conducted to ensure valid conclusions regarding predictive relationships. By means of such analyses consumer market microstructure dynamics are described to generate results {{that could be used to}} provide input to policy and <b>programme</b> <b>formulation</b> as well as the education of personal financial advisors who deal with financially vulnerable customers...|$|E
40|$|MM thesis - P&DMThe City of Johannesburg {{is still}} facing many {{challenges}} {{with regard to}} promotion of gender equality and institutionalization of women„s rights. These challenges include transformation in Gender relations, poverty, access to basic needs, access to employment and economic empowerment. These challenges have been translated into National priorities with compelling Gender dimensions, which {{need to be addressed}} if the CoJ is to advance towards women empowerment and gender equality. This research study was aimed at examining the factors leading to the lack of Gender considerations in City of Johannesburg (CoJ), Department of Economic Development (DED) Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMME) development and support programme. The Research findings revealed that the CoJ still need to undergo a paradigm shift with regard {{to the way in which}} resources are allocated, how women are benefiting from poverty alleviation and economic empowerment programmes and keeping regular, accurate and updated Gender-disaggregated statistics. The paper makes the recommendation that Gender consideration should inform policy <b>formulation,</b> <b>programme</b> implementation, monitoring, evaluation and reporting. This is due to the fact that Gender and women empowerment is one of the Government priorities and also one of the Millennium Development Goals. Therefore DED should prioritize Gender issues and include Gender indicators in the Departmental scorecard. Change of mindset amongst DED staff with regard to Gender and Women empowerment, ongoing training on Gender issues and concepts are highly recommended for effective and efficient implementation of Gender sensitive programmes in the Departmen...|$|R
40|$|The Strategic Plan of Cordoba (SPC) {{is one of}} the few {{strategic}} {{urban development}} plans in Latin America, which has actually been implemented in the majority of its components. The SPC was conceived as a collective and global project of the city as a whole without excessive conflicting interests or special ownership by a few. The SPC integrated a policy of public works – oriented at the “social debt” which existed in the city – with a work on urban norms and directions and economic development. The SPC as a space for articulation achieved to organise a great number of representatives from civil society organisations, achieving legitimacy and representation in the work of the SPC. The SPC has given a new orientation and increased the municipal capacity to manage the city. The SPC has developed innovative and participatory forms of management (e. g. the Follow-Up and Monitoring Groups, with their annual meetings for presenting audit reports known as “presenting the bills”). The population has perceived the incentive to participate in the planning process of the SPC since it was possible to propose concrete projects, as long as these were feasible. The SPC has pursued the detailed feasibility study of a number of these projects others have been delegated to sectoral agencies. The SPC has shown flexibility in the incorporation of new projects, and there existed two directions of work initiatives: “top-down” project planning for the big “strategic” projects of global importance, and it stimulated “bottom-up” planning of projects that reflected the social demand side. It needs to be noted that the SPC has known how to mobilise and diversify sources of finance of its projects and been able to obtain additional funding. Financing agencies like the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) have appreciated the SPC as a reference of a consensus-based <b>Programme.</b> The <b>formulation</b> of the SPC has been executed, basically, with own resources of the municipality. Nevertheless, in certain moments it has been difficult for the Municipal Technical Team (MTT) to establish commitment and willingness to cooperate between civil society and the municipal government. For example, the MTT was seen as an “elite team” by other municipal units. The Municipal Council conceived the participation of citizens as a kind of competition. The members of the Municipal Council did not participate regularly in the workshops and meetings of the SPC...|$|R
40|$|Background: Community {{health workers}} (CHWs) can {{play vital roles}} in {{increasing}} coverage of basic health services. However, {{there is a need}} for a systematic categorisation of CHWs that will aid common understanding among policy makers, programme planners, and researchers. Objective: To identify the common themes in the definitions and descriptions of CHWs that will aid delineation within this cadre and distinguish CHWs from other healthcare providers. Design: A systematic review of peer-reviewed papers and grey literature. Results: We identified 119 papers that provided definitions of CHWs in 25 countries across 7 regions. The review shows CHWs as paraprofessionals or lay individuals with an in-depth understanding of the community culture and language, have received standardised job-related training of a shorter duration than health professionals, and their primary goal is to provide culturally appropriate health services to the community. CHWs can be categorised into three groups by education and pre-service training. These are lay health workers (individuals with little or no formal education who undergo a few days to a few weeks of informal training), level 1 paraprofessionals (individuals with some form of secondary education and subsequent informal training), and level 2 paraprofessionals (individuals with some form of secondary education and subsequent formal training lasting a few months to more than a year). Lay health workers tend to provide basic health services as unpaid volunteers while level 1 paraprofessionals often receive an allowance and level 2 paraprofessionals tend to be salaried. Conclusions: This review provides a categorisation of CHWs that may be useful for health policy <b>formulation,</b> <b>programme</b> planning, and research...|$|R
