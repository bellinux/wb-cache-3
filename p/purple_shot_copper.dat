The addition of blackcurrant to a mix of cider and lager results in [...] "diesel" [...] or [...] "snakebite and black" [...] available at pubs. A [...] "black 'n' black" [...] can be made by adding a small amount of blackcurrant juice to a pint of stout. The head is <b>purple</b> if the <b>shot</b> of juice is placed in the glass first. Blackcurrant juice is sometimes combined with whey in an endurance/energy-type drink.|$|R
6000|$|... "Between the {{darkness}} of earth and heaven she was burning fiercely upon a disc of <b>purple</b> sea <b>shot</b> by the blood-red play of gleams; upon a disc of water glittering and sinister. A high, clear flame, an immense and lonely flame, ascended from the ocean, and from its summit the black smoke poured continuously at the sky. She burned furiously, mournful and imposing like a funeral pile kindled in the night, surrounded by the sea, watched over by the stars. A magnificent death had come like a grace, like a gift, like a reward to that old ship {{at the end of}} her laborious days. The surrender of her weary ghost to the keeping of stars and sea was stirring like the sight of a glorious triumph. The masts fell just before daybreak, and for a moment there was a burst and turmoil of sparks that seemed to fill with flying fire the night patient and watchful, the vast night lying silent upon the sea. At daylight she was only a charred shell, floating still under a cloud of smoke and bearing a glowing mass of coal within.|$|R
50|$|Since it {{was common}} {{knowledge}} that Moran was hijacking Capone's Detroit-based liquor shipments, police focused their attention on Detroit's predominantly Jewish <b>Purple</b> Gang. Mug <b>shots</b> of <b>Purple</b> members George Lewis, Eddie Fletcher, Phil Keywell {{and his younger brother}} Harry, were picked out by landladies Mrs. Doody and Mrs. Orvidson, who had taken in three men as roomers ten days before the massacre; their rooming houses were directly {{across the street from the}} Clark Street garage. Later, these women wavered in their identification, and Fletcher, Lewis, and Harry Keywell were all questioned and cleared by Chicago Police. Nevertheless, the Keywell brothers (and by extension the Purple Gang) would remain ensnared in the massacre case for all time. Many also believed what the killers wanted them to believe - that the police did it.|$|R
5|$|Iridion 3D {{features}} five {{types of}} weapons, with {{three levels of}} power each. Players boost weapon power by collecting powerups of the color that matches the current weapon. Collecting a different color gives the player the first level of that weapon type. If the player's ship is destroyed the power level of the weapon is reduced by one. Each weapon has advantages and disadvantages. The player starts with the red weapon, which is relatively weak but fires rapidly in a large spread. Green weapons are inaccurate but fill the screen with <b>shots.</b> <b>Purple</b> weapons spin in a counterclockwise motion slowly and are fairly strong. Yellow torpedo-like weapons are very powerful but powerups are rare and the weapon fires slowly. Blue weapons, a more powerful version of Yellow weapons, are found only on the last level. Flashing powerups restore the craft's shields.|$|R
40|$|International audienceLIPSS (Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structure) {{formation}} on copper {{thin films}} induced by a picosecond laser beam (Nd:YAG laser at 266 nm, 42 ps and 10 Hz) was studied experimentally. Copper thin films were deposited on glass and silicon substrates by magnetron sputtering. The surface modifications of irradiated zones {{were analyzed by}} scanning electron microscopy. Two distinct types of LIPSS were identified {{with respect to the}} laser fluence (F), number of laser shots (N) and substrate material. Namely, with a number of laser shots (1000 < N < 10, 000) and a fluence of (200 mJ/cm 2 < F < 500 mJ/cm 2), Low Spatial Frequency LIPSS (LSFL with a spatial period of Λ ∼ 260 nm and an orientation perpendicular to polarization) and High Spatial Frequency LIPSS (HSFL with a spatial period of Λ ∼ 130 nm and an orientation parallel to the polarization) were observed. The regime of regular spikes formation was determined for N ≥ 1000. Moreover, the 2 D-map of the relationship among LIPSS formation, laser fluence and number of laser <b>shots</b> on <b>copper</b> thin film with two different substrates was established. A physics interpretation of regular spikes and LIPSS formation on copper thin film induced by ps laser with overlapping multi-shots is proposed based on experimental data and the theory of Plateau-Rayleigh instability...|$|R
5000|$|In a shot tower, lead {{is heated}} until molten, then dropped through a copper sieve {{high in the}} tower. The liquid lead forms tiny spherical balls by surface tension, then solidifies as it falls. The {{partially}} cooled balls are caught at {{the floor of the}} tower in a water-filled basin. The now fully cooled balls are checked for roundness and sorted by size; those that are [...] "out of round" [...] are remelted. A slightly inclined table is used for checking roundness. To make larger <b>shot</b> sizes, a <b>copper</b> sieve with larger holes is used. However, the maximum size is limited by the height of the tower, because larger shot sizes must fall farther to cool. A shot tower with a 40-meter drop can produce up to #6 shot (nominally 2.4mm in diameter) while an 80-meter drop can produce #2 shot (nominally 3.8mm in diameter). [...] A polishing with a slight amount of graphite is necessary for lubrication and to prevent oxidation.|$|R
60|$|They found {{themselves}} next day talking love {{to one another}} high up on some rocks above a steep bank of snow that overhung a precipice {{on the eastern side}} of the Fee glacier. By this time Capes' hair had bleached nearly white, and his skin had become a skin of red <b>copper</b> <b>shot</b> with gold. They were now both in a state of unprecedented physical fitness. And such skirts as Ann Veronica had had when she entered the valley of Saas were safely packed away in the hotel, and she wore a leather belt and loose knickerbockers and puttees--a costume that suited the fine, long lines of her limbs far better than any feminine walking-dress could do. Her complexion had resisted the snow-glare wonderfully; her skin had only deepened its natural warmth a little under the Alpine sun. She had pushed aside her azure veil, taken off her snow-glasses, and sat smiling under her hand at the shining glories--the lit cornices, the blue shadows, the softly rounded, enormous snow masses, the deep places full of quivering luminosity--of the Taschhorn and Dom. The sky was cloudless, effulgent blue.|$|R
40|$|Lead and {{strontium}} isotopes are {{two powerful}} tracers {{that can be}} used to identify or constrain the provenance of a wide range of archaeological materials, but these two isotopic tracers have been rarely employed to infer the sources of artifacts in the southwestern USA. This dissertation contains four studies that demonstrate how these isotopic systems can address questions about the sources of three types of archaeological materials found in this region: turquoise, lead-based glaze-paints, and metals. The analysis of 116 samples of turquoise from 17 deposits in the southwestern USA reveals that lead and strontium isotopes are robust and sensitive tracers of turquoise at multiple scales. Isotopic variation among turquoise deposits correlates with broad regional differences in the geologic and tectonic setting of the rocks and mineral deposits which host turquoise mineralization. Many turquoise deposits also have unique isotopic signatures that will enable insights into ancient patterns of turquoise acquisition at regional and local levels. To show the utility of these tracers when applied to archaeological turquoise, I use lead and strontium isotopic measurements to establish that the Silver Bell Mountains are the likely source turquoise found at the Redtail site in the Tucson Basin, Arizona, USA. This dissertation also contains new, high-precision isotopic ratios of lead ores (galena and cerrusite) from four mining districts in New Mexico, including the Cerrillos Hills. All districts studied are possible sources of lead used by Pueblo IV communities to produce glaze paints. These new measurements, made by multiple-collector ICP-MS, define the isotopic composition of the ore deposits with greater precision and accuracy than achieved in previous studies, indicating an opportunity to improve interpretations about the provenance of lead in glaze paints. Lead isotopes are also found to be useful tools for identifying lead and copper metal associated with the 1540 - 1542 Vázquez de Coronado expedition. Lead <b>shot</b> and <b>copper</b> crossbow boltheads from two sites with archaeological evidence for the expedition's presence were determined to share similar or identical lead isotopic ratios. I propose this specific isotopic "fingerprint" can be used to identify other artifacts belonging to the expedition in the Southwest...|$|R
