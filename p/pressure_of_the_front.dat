Noise data was compared by total sound pressure level and 1 / 3 octave band frequency sound pressure level. Also, each section was compared by T-test using SPSS. RESULTS: In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uphill section, it was shown that <b>the</b> sound <b>pressure</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> tire at Sugwang-Ri and Sinchon-RI sections was higher than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rear tire in low and high frequency band. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> high slope section <b>of</b> Sangsaek-Ri, <b>the</b> sound <b>pressure</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> tire was higher than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rear tire in high frequency.

Numerical schemes for solving <b>the</b> system <b>of</b> hyperbolic conversation laws using the ZND analytical solution as initial condition are presented.

In the stable case with overdrive factor f = 1. 8, <b>the</b> temporal histories <b>of</b> peak <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> detonation <b>front</b> computed by WENO-JS and WENO-Z reach the theoretical steady state.

In the unstable cases with overdrive factors f = 1. 6, f = 1. 4, f = 1. 34 and f = 1. 3, <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> all WENO schemes agree well with each other as the resolution, defined as <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> grid points per half-length of reaction zone, increases.

40|$|The present work investigates <b>the</b> {{structure}} <b>of</b> fast supersonic turbulent flames typically observed as precursors to <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> detonation. These {{high speed}} deflagrations are obtained after <b>the</b> interaction <b>of</b> a detonation wave with cylindrical obstacles. Two mixtures {{having the same}} propensity for local hot spot formation were considered, namely hydrogen-oxygen and methane-oxygen. It was shown that the methane mixture sustained turbulent fast flames, while the hydrogen mixture did not. Detailed high speed visualizations of nearly two-dimensional flow fields permitted to identify the key mechanism involved. The strong vorticity generation associated with shock reflections in methane permitted to drive jets. These provided local enhancement of mixing rates, sustenance <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> waves, organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> in stronger fewer modes and eventually the transition to detonation.

Experiments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jet engine exhaust flow (hereinafter jet flow for short) field and tests of three kinds of blast fences in two positions were carried out. The {{results show that the}} pressure and temperature at <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jet flow decrease gradually as the flow moves farther away from the nozzle. The pressure falls fast with <b>the</b> maximum rate <b>of</b> 41. 7 %.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a comparative study <b>of</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> repeated solid obstacles on <b>the</b> propagation <b>of</b> premixed flames. <b>Pressure,</b> speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flame <b>front</b> {{as well as}} structure of reaction zones are studied for three fuels; hydrogen, liquefied petroleum gas, LPG and compressed natural gas, CNG. Two equivalence ratios are examined for each fuel using eighteen different configurations of three baffle plates and two obstacles with a square cross-section having blockage ratios of either 0. 24 or 0. 5. For CNG and LPG fuel mixtures two equivalence ratios of 1. 0 and 0. 8 are studied while for H 2 /air, lean mixtures of Ф = 0. 7 and 0. 8 are only used and this {{is limited by the}} excessive overpressures. The results show that the peak pressure and its rate of change can be increased by increasing the blockage ratio or by decreasing the space between successive baffles. This was found to be of use for all gases, but the peak pressure and its rate of change were an order of magnitude higher for hydrogen flames than for LPG or CNG flames. This is consistent with differences in the laminar flame speeds of these fuels. As illustrated by the high speed images <b>of</b> LIF-OH, <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> wrinkling and contortion in <b>the</b> flame <b>front</b> increase as <b>the</b> blockages increase. The images also show how <b>the</b> flame <b>front</b> relaminarises with increasing distances between obstacles, which accounts for the pressure decrease with increasing separation. It is also found that more than one obstacle is needed to achieve a turbulent flame structure with intense corrugations. Based on the images, hydrogen flames result in less wrinkled flame fronts than CNG and LPG after propagating past <b>the</b> same sequence <b>of</b> obstacles.

Both currents are driven by topographically induced distortions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arctic <b>Front's</b> barotropic <b>pressure</b> field. The SIC is simulated to be an upstream precursor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Faroe Current (FC).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address <b>the</b> {{fundamental}} challenge <b>of</b> balancing <b>the</b> trade-off between the optical and electrical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> side transparent conductive oxide (TCO) in silicon heterojunction solar cells. We present two-dimensional numerical device simulations as well as experimental investigations concerning n-type silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells featuring either a front emitter or rear emitter. By varying both, <b>the</b> pitch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> side metal grid electrode and <b>the</b> sheet resistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> side TCO, <b>the</b> fill factor losses associated with the two-dimensional carrier transport are investigated. We prove experimentally that in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rear emitter design a substantial part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lateral carrier transport is shifted from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> side TCO into the absorber, thus, lowering the effective sheet resistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> side. Owing to this additional lateral current path the trade-off between the optical and electrical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> side TCO are less pronounced for a rear emitter cell design compared to <b>the</b> traditional <b>front</b> emitter cell design. This leads to fewer restrictions for <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> <b>front</b> side TCOs and <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> side metal grid electrode. Depending on the optimization route, this should allow for higher solar cell efficiencies or <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> more economic TCOs...|$|R
