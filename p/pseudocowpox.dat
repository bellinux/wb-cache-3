40|$|ABSTRACT. Molecular {{analysis}} of parapoxvirus envelope genes was performed. Parapoxvirus DNA was detected in eight calves from eight farms in Iwate Prefecture, Japan, between April and September 2010. Seven of the detected viruses {{were identified as}} bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) by sequencing, because their nucleotide identity was more than 96. 8 % similar compared with BPSV strain V 660. Among them, two formed a subgroup, because their amplicons were digested with Xmn I (a marker for BPSV) and Hinc II and exhibited a T 61 C nucleotide substitution in the sequenced region. The remaining virus was <b>pseudocowpox</b> virus {{that had not been}} reported previously in Japan. Our results demonstrate the presence of a new BPSV variant in Japan with genetic variability in the envelope gene.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the susceptibility of bovine umbilical cord endothelial (BUE) cells to bovine herpesvirus (BHV) 1, BHV 2, BHV 4 and BHV 5, and to <b>pseudocowpox</b> virus. the detection limits and growth curves of these viruses in BUE cells were compared with those in Vero, Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK), or bovine fetal diploid lung (BFDL) cells. Detection limits were determined by inoculating cell cultures with serial 10 -fold dilutions of these viruses, and growth curves by titration of virus, harvested at various times after infecting cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0. 1. The detection limits of BHV 2 and BHV 4 were lower in BUE cells than in Vero or MDBK cells, and cytopathic effects were observed earlier in BUE cells. In addition, BHV 2 and BHV 4 grew to higher titres in BUE cells than in Vero or MDBK cells. BUE cells appeared to be equally susceptible to BHV 5, but less susceptible to BHV 1. 1 and BHV 1. 1 than MDBK cells. The study showed that BUE cells are highly susceptible to BHV 2 and BHV 4, and that the use of BUE cells can improve the laboratory diagnosis of these viruses.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{identified}} a gene encoding a homolog of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the <b>Pseudocowpox</b> virus (PCPV) genome. The predicted protein shows 27 % amino acid identity to human VEGF-A. It also shows 41 and 61 % amino acid identity to VEGFs encoded by orf virus (ORFV) strains NZ 2 and NZ 7, respectively. Assays of the expressed VEGF-like protein of PCPV (PCPVVR 634 VEGF) demonstrated that PCPVVR 634 VEGF is mitogenic for endothelial cells and is capable of inducing vascular permeability. PCPVVR 634 VEGF bound VEGF receptor- 2 (VEGFR- 2) but did not bind VEGFR- 1 or VEGFR- 3. These results indicate that PCPVVR 634 VEGF is a biologically {{active member of the}} VEGF family which shares with the ORFV-encoded VEGFs a receptor binding profile that differs from those of all cellular members of the VEGF family.

40|$|Background: Orf virus (ORFV) is the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} contagious pustular dermatitis {{and is the}} prototype of the genus Parapoxvirus (PPV). It causes a severe exanthematous dermatitis that afflicts domestic and wild small ruminants. Case presentation: In the present study, an outbreak of proliferative dermatitis in farmed goats. The presence of ORFV in tissue scrapings from the lips was confirmed by B 2 L gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The molecular characterization of the ORFV was performed using PCR amplification, DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the B 2 L gene. Conclusion: The results of this investigation indicated that the outbreak was caused by infection with an ORFV that was closely related genetically to Nantou (DQ 934351), which was isolated from the Tai wan province of China and Hoping (EU 935106), which originated from South Korea in 2008.

40|$|This review {{deals with}} the role of viruses in the {{aetiology}} of bovine mastitis. Bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine herpesvirus 4, foot-and-mouth disease virus, and parainfluenza 3 virus have been isolated from milk from cows with clinical mastitis. Intramammary inoculations of bovine herpesvirus 1 or parainfluenza 3 virus-induced clinical mastitis, while an intramammary inoculation of foot-and-mouth disease virus resulted in necrosis of the mammary gland. Subclinical mastitis has been induced after a simultaneous intramammary and intranasal inoculation of lactating cows with bovine herpesvirus 4. Bovine leukaemia virus has been detected in mammary tissue of cows with subclinical mastitis, but whether this virus was able to induce bovine mastitis has not been reported. Bovine herpesvirus 2, vaccinia, cowpox, <b>pseudocowpox,</b> vesicular stomatitis, foot-and-mouth disease viruses, and bovine papillomaviruses can play an indirect role in the aetiology of bovine mastitis. These viruses can induce teat lesions, for instance in the ductus papillaris, which result in a reduction of the natural defence mechanisms of the udder and indirectly in bovine mastitis due to bacterial pathogens. Bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, bovine immunodeficiency virus, and bovine leukaemia virus infections may play an indirect role in bovine mastitis, due to their immunosuppressive properties. But, more research is warranted to underline their indirect role in bovine mastitis.

40|$|Background: Occupational exanthematic {{diseases}} {{represent an}} important cause {{of public health}} impact and economical losses. Among the viral exanthematic diseases, two caused by poxviruses are notewor-thy: the bovine vaccinia (BV), caused by the Vaccinia virus (VACV); and the milker???s nodule, in which the agent is the <b>Pseudocowpox</b> virus (PCPV). Both agents are zoonotic and {{have been associated with}} several cases of bovine infection. In Brazilian rural areas BV has been highly prevalent, particularly in milk herds. Farmers, milkers and their close contacts developed lesions on the hands, forearms, legs and face accom-panied by several systemic symptoms. Although VACV and PCPV present with similar epidemiological and transmission patterns, no VACV and PCPV co-infection cases have to date been described. Objectives: To describe the first case of zoonotic VACV and PCVP co-infection, based on serological and molecular methods. Study design and results: In this work we report a case of a Brazilian rural worker who presented with a large severely ulcerated-pustule skin lesion, associated with fever, headache, malaise, myalgia and axillary, inguinal and cervical limphadenopathy. The worker declared occupational contact with cattle that hadnotable injuries on their teats. Human andbovine clinical sampleswere collected and submitted to serological and molecular tests. PCR and phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of VACV DNA and PCPV DNA in the patient???s lesion. Serological tests indicated anti-VACV neutralizing antibodies and molecular assays showed the presence of VACV and PCPV DNA in the patient sera. VACV and PCPV also were detected in dairy cattle. Conclusion: Together, these results indicate a case of zoonotic VACV/PCPV co-infection. Epidemiological surveillance and appropriate medical treatment are essential for the control of both diseases, especially in the most severe cases, as described in the present study...|$|E

This effort has the potential to improve our nation's ability to discriminate between foreign animal diseases and those that are endemic using a single assay, thereby increasing our ability to protect animal populations of high economic importance in the United States. Under 2005 DHS funding we have developed multiplexed (MUX) nucleic-acid-based PCR assays that combine foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) detection with rule-out tests for two other foreign animal diseases Vesicular Exanthema of Swine (VESV) and Swine Vesicular Disease (SVD) and four other domestic viral diseases Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV), Bovine Herpes Virus 1 (BHV- 1 or Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitus IBR), Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Parapox virus complex (which includes Bovine Papular Stomatitis Virus BPSV, Orf of sheep, and <b>Pseudocowpox).</b> Under 2006 funding we have developed a Multiplexed PCR [MUX] porcine assay for detection of FMDV with rule out tests for VESV and SVD foreign animal diseases in addition to one other domestic vesicular animal disease vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and one domestic animal disease of swine porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). We have also developed a MUX bovine assay for detection of FMDV with rule out tests for the two bovine foreign animal diseases malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), rinderpest virus (RPV) and the domestic diseases vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), infectious bovine rhinotracheitus virus (BHV- 1), bluetongue virus (BTV), and the Parapox viruses which are of two bovine types bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) and psuedocowpox (PCP). This document provides details of signature generation, evaluation, and testing, as well as the specific methods and materials used. A condensed summary of the development, testing and performance of the multiplexed assay panel was presented in a 126 page separate document, entitled 'Development and Characterization of A Multiplexed RT-PCR Species Specific Assay for Bovine and one for Porcine Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Rule-Out'. This supplemental document provides additional details of large amount of data collected for signature generation, evaluation, and testing, as well as the specific methods and materials used for all steps in the assay development and utilization processes. In contrast to last years effort, the development of the bovine and porcine panels is pending additional work to complete analytical characterization of FMDV, VESV, VSV, SVD, RPV and MCF. The signature screening process and final panel composition impacts this effort. The unique challenge presented this year was having strict predecessor limitations in completing characterization, where efforts at LLNL must preceed efforts at PIADC, such challenges were alleviated in the 2006 reporting by having characterization data from the interlaboratory comparison and at Plum Island under AgDDAP project. We will present an addendum at a later date with additional data on the characterization of the porcine and bovine multiplex assays when that data is available...|$|E
40|$|Parapoxvirus (PPV) are {{member of}} a genus in the family poxviridae which {{currently}} encompasses four species: the prototype orf virus (OV), bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV), <b>pseudocowpox</b> virus (PCPV) and parapoxvirus of New Zealand red deer (PVNZ). PPVs cause widespread, but localized diseases of small and large ruminants and {{they can also be}} transmitted to man. Knowledge of the molecular biology of PPV is still limited as compared to orthopoxviruses, especially vaccinia virus (VACV). The PPV genome displays a high G+C content and relatively small size for poxvirus. Coventional electron microscopy displays PPV virions with ovoid shape and slightly smaller in size than the brickshaped orthopoxviruses. The most striking feature, which readily enables identification of PPV, is a tubule-like structure that surrounds the particle in a spiral fashion. PPV genome organization and content is very similar to that of other poxviruses, the central region contain 88 genes which are present in all poxviruse, in contrast the terminal regions are variable and contain a set of genes unique to the genus PPV. Genes in the near-terminal regions of the genome are frequently not essential for growth in cultured cells encoding factors with important roles in virushost interactions including modulating host immune responses and determining host range. Recently it was suggested that the open reading frames (ORFs) 109 and 110 of the OV genome have a major role in determining species specificity during natural infection in sheep and goats. This hypothesis is based on the analysis of a few number of sequences of different sheep and goats viral isolates. PPV replicate into the cytoplasm of infected cells and produce three structurally different infectious particles: the intracellular mature virions (IMV), intracellular enveloped virions (IEV) and the extracellular enveloped virions (EEV). The vaccinia A 33 R and A 34 R hotologue proteins encoded by the ORFS 109 and 110 are expressed in the envelope of the IEV and EEV. The F 1 L immunodominant protein of orf virus is the major component of the surface tubule structure of the IMV and can post-translationaly insert into membranes via Cterminal, hydrofobic anchor sequence like its orthologue VACV H 3 L protein. Moreover the F 1 L protein binds to glycosaminoglycans on the cell surface and has an important role in IMV adsorption to mammalian cells. In this study we investigated the morphogenesis of the PPV through the construction of a mutant virus deleted of the F 1 L protein. A study of the deleted virus life cycle was conducted in different type of cells and its morphology was observed with electron microscopy. It was demonstared that F 1 L protein have important role in morphogenesis and infectivity. Moreover it is essential to determine the spiral fashion of the tubule like structure of the virion surface. Some pathogenetic aspects of the PPV infection were studied, in particular the protein implicated in the host range were analysed in detail. An experimental infection with OV and PCPV was conducted in goats and sheep. After infection, the severity of the lesions were comparable in both the animal species. The OV did not result in severe disease neither in sheep nor in goats, suggesting that host factors, rather than virus strain characteristics, may {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of the Parapoxvirus infections. The PCPV failed to produce any lesion in both sheep and goats, ruling out the possibility of any recombination between PCPV and OV during natural infection in these animal species. The phylogenetic analysis of the ORFs 109 and 110 from several goats and sheep viral isolates showed a clustering based on the antigenic content of the protein that was independent from species and geographic origin...|$|E
40|$|Parapoxviruses (PPVs) are {{zoonotic}} viruses {{which cause}} contagious pustular skin infections of sheep, goats and cattle worldwide. In addition, {{they have more}} recently been shown to infect other animals such as red deer, seals, camels and reindeer. Cases of contagious pustular stomatitis in Finnish reindeer have been reported for many years. This economically important disease occurs typically during winter and {{is more common in}} the southern parts of the reindeer herding districts than in the north. The first severe outbreak occurred in the winter 1992 - 1993, and during the winter of 1999 - 2000 and in the late winter 2007 outbreaks of the disease were again observed. Usual symptoms include diminished appetite, drooling, fever, and later erosions and ulcerative lesions in the mouth. The aims of this study were to establish specific and rapid detection methods for the causative agent of the disease and characterize the viruses circulating in Finland. The causative agent of reindeer pustular stomatitis was originally considered to be Orf virus (ORFV) of the genus Parapoxvirus. PCR methods amplifying different regions of the PPV genomes were developed to analyse clinical samples obtained from outbreaks of the disease in reindeer and later from viruses isolated from the disease of sheep and cattle in Finland. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses of the Finnish PPVs, known members of the genus Parapoxvirus and selected members of the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae were conducted to identify the virus species isolated from reindeer. The results showed that the reindeer PPV from 1999 - 2000 is most closely related to the cattle PPV <b>Pseudocowpox</b> virus (PCPV) whereas the PPV strains from the winter of 1992 - 1993 outbreak grouped with sheep ORFV strains. Reindeer samples from the 2007 outbreak were identified as both PCPV and ORFV. Analysis of the similarity between genes of reindeer PCPV and ORFV isolates, Finnish sheep ORFV and cattle PCPV isolates indicated that these viruses have been circulating among Finnish reindeer, cattle and sheep at least ten years. Since the initial classification of the viruses causing pustular stomatitis in Finnish reindeer relied solely on the partial sequence analysis of virion core- and EEV envelope phospholipase protein sequences, the genome of PCPV-like reindeer isolate (F 00. 120 R) was sequenced by shotgun sequencing of plasmid sublibraries of cosmids covering the central region of the genome, and by sequencing transposon random insertion libraries of plasmids derived from each end of the genome. The F 00. 120 R and the genomic sequence of a reference strain of PCPV (VR 634) were annotated and analyzed in this study. This first characterization of PCPV genomes revealed that F 00. 120 R and VR 634 are 135 and 145 kb in length and contain 131 and 134 putative genes, respectively. The organization of their genomes was found to be similar to that of other PPVs and both included 88 predicted genes that are conserved across all sequenced poxviruses. F 00. 120 R was found to have four, possibly fragmented, genes at the left terminus and another near the central region of the genome that are not present in ORFV or Bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV; another PPV) genomes. In addition, the F 00. 120 R genome was found to lack six genes seen near the right genome terminus of other PPVs. Comparing the PPV proteomes and whole genome phylogenetic analyses confirmed the classification of PCPV as a separate species within the PPV genus and verified that the virus causing pustular stomatitis in reindeer in 1999 - 2000 can be classified as PCPV. The observed six gene deletion at the right terminus of the F 00. 120 R genome was further investigated in an attempt to use it in differentiating PCPV and ORFV causing pustular stomatitis in reindeer. The preliminary PCR analyses of wild type virus and early passages of F 00. 120 R implied that the deletion of genes may have arisen during cell culture of the virus. The sequence around the deleted region was determined by sequencing two cloned overlapping PCR fragments from F 00. 120 R wt virus isolated from lesion material. The same region was sequenced from an Italian PCPV field isolate (It 1303). Further PCR analyses together with sequence determination showed that a 5431 bp sequence containing genes 116 - 121 was likely to have been deleted from the F 00. 120 R genome prior to the 7 th passage in cell culture. In addition, genes 116 - 121 were present in It 1303 and in other isolates of reindeer and bovine PCPV isolated in Finland during the years 2005 - 2010. These results indicate that the genome of reindeer PCPV is about 140 kbp in length and has 137 genes instead of previously estimated length of 135 kbp and 131 genes; it contains homologues of all known ORFV genes and this analysis further reinforces the close genetic relationship between PCPV and ORFV...|$|E
40|$|Mastitis is {{an often}} {{occurring}} disease in dairy cattle {{with an enormous}} economic impact for milk producers worldwide. Despite intensive research, which is historically based on the detection of bacterial udder pathogens, still around 20 - 35 % of clinical cases of bovine mastitis have an unknown aetiology. Due to {{the high number of}} unknown causes of clinical mastitis, studies were undertaken to gain more insight into the role of viruses in this important disease. For the first time, we found that BHV 4 may be involved in the aetiology of bovine mastitis, because it was isolated from milk of 3 (5 %) out of 58 cows with clinical mastitis and not from the 58 matched control cows. Concomitant with the isolation of BHV 4, an increase in antibody titre against BHV 4 was noted in two of these three mastitis cows from which BHV 4 was isolated. The use of the bovine umbilical cord endothelial cells, a cell type seldom used in bovine virology, proved to be a good choice. Susceptibility studies showed that BHV 4 grew to much higher titres in bovine umbilical cord endothelial cells than in the routinely used Madin Darby bovine kidney cells. The bovine umbilical cord endothelial cell type was not only highly susceptible to BHV 4, but it also proved to be susceptible to other bovine herpesviruses, such as BHV 2 and BHV 5. For the detection of BHV 4 antibodies only one commercial indirect-ELISA was available. We developed and evaluated an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) for the detection of antibodies directed against BHV 4. After validation, the IPMA proved to be a reliable test, and it was found more sensitive for the early detection of BHV 4 antibodies than the indirect-ELISA. In addition, a serological survey showed that the estimated seroprevalence of BHV 4 in Dutch cattle was 16 - 18 % and that the percentage of BHV 4 seropositive cattle varied by age category between 6 and 43 %. A polymerase chain reaction for the detection of BHV 4 -glycoprotein-B (gB) DNA was developed and validated, and a nested-PCR was modified to detect BHV 4 -thymidine kinase (TK) DNA in bovine milk samples. Both methods proved to be rapid and reliable tests for the screening of BHV 4 DNA in milk. In a second case-control study, using these newly developed diagnostic tools, BHV 4 and BHV 4 -gB DNA was detected in milk from 2 (4 %) out of 54 cows with clinical mastitis, whereas no BHV 4 was detected by virus isolation and PCR in 54 matched controls. An experimental study was performed to examine whether a simultaneous intramammary and intranasal inoculation of lactating cows with BHV 4 induced clinical mastitis. No clinical mastitis was noted in the four inoculated lactating cows, but the somatic cell counts increased significantly in milk of 50 % of the BHV 4 inoculated quarters, compared to the non-inoculated quarters of the same cows and quarters of mock-inoculated cows (control group) on days 8, 9, and 11 post-inoculation. Another interesting finding was that a bacterial infection, Streptococcus uberis infection, triggered BHV 4 replication. Based on the studies performed, we conclude that BHV 4 {{may play a role in}} the aetiology of bovine mastitis, albeit likely a minor one in clinical mastitis. Studies suggest rather a role in subclinical mastitis and an indirect role for BHV 4 in the aetiology of bovine mastitis. More research is warranted to investigate its indirect role as a result of e. g. immunosuppression. In a review study, the role of viruses in the aetiology of bovine mastitis has been noted. Bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine herpesvirus 4, foot-and-mouth disease virus, and parainfluenza 3 virus have been isolated from milk from cows with clinical mastitis. Intramammary inoculations of bovine herpesvirus 1 or parainfluenza 3 virus induced clinical mastitis, while an intramammary inoculation of foot-and-mouth disease virus resulted in necrosis of the mammary gland. Subclinical mastitis has been induced after a simultaneous intramammary and intranasal inoculation of lactating cows with bovine herpesvirus 4. Bovine leukaemia virus has been detected in mammary tissue of cows with subclinical mastitis, but whether this virus was able to induce bovine mastitis has not been reported. Bovine herpesvirus 2, vaccinia, cowpox, <b>pseudocowpox,</b> vesicular stomatitis, foot-and-mouth disease viruses, and bovine papillomaviruses can play an indirect role in the aetiology of bovine mastitis. These viruses can induce teat lesions, for instance in the ductus papillaris, which result in a reduction of the natural defence mechanisms of the udder and indirectly in bovine mastitis due to bacterial pathogens. Bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, bovine immunodeficiency virus, and bovine leukaemia virus infections may play an indirect role in bovine mastitis, due to their immunosuppressive properties. Finally, based on the studies performed during this thesis and the review study on viral infections and bovine mastitis, we may conclude that viruses can play a direct or indirect role in the aetiology of bovine mastitis...|$|E
40|$|The Poxviruses are {{a family}} of double {{stranded}} DNA (dsDNA) viruses that cause disease in many species, both vertebrate and invertebrate. Their genomes {{range in size from}} 135 to 365 kbp and show conservation in both organization and content. In particular, the central genomic regions of the chordopoxvirus subfamily (those capable of infecting vertebrates) contain 88 genes which are present in all the virus species characterised to date and which mostly occur in the same order and orientation. In contrast, however, the terminal regions of the genomes frequently contain genes that are species or genera-specific and that are not essential for the growth of the virus in vitro but instead often encode factors with important roles in vivo including modulation of the host immune response to infection and determination of the host range of the virus. The Parapoxviruses (PPV), of which Orf virus is the prototypic species, represent a genus within the chordopoxvirus subfamily of Poxviridae and are characterised by their ability to infect ruminants and humans. The genus currently contains four recognised species of virus, bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) and <b>pseudocowpox</b> virus (PCPV) both of which infect cattle, orf virus (OV) that infects sheep and goats, and parapoxvirus of red deer in New Zealand (PVNZ). The ORFV genome has been fully sequenced, as has that of BPSV, and is 138 kb in length encoding 132 genes. The vast majority of these genes allow the virus to replicate in the cytoplasm of the infected host cell and therefore encode proteins involved in replication, transcription and metabolism of nucleic acids. These genes are well conserved between all known genera of poxviruses. There is however another class of genes, located {{at either end of the}} linear dsDNA genome, that encode proteins which are non-essential for replication and generally dictate host range and virulence of the virus. The non-essential genes are often the most variable within and between species of virus and therefore are potentially useful for diagnostic purposes. Given their role in subverting the host-immune response to infection they are also targets for novel therapeutics. The function of only a relatively small number of these proteins has been elucidated and there are several genes whose function still remains obscure principally because there is little similarity between them and proteins of known function in current sequence databases. It is thought that by selectively removing some of the virulence genes, or at least neutralising the proteins in some way, current vaccines could be improved. The evolution of poxviruses has been proposed to be an adaptive process involving frequent events of gene gain and loss, such that the virus co-evolves with its specific host. Gene capture or horizontal gene transfer from the host to the virus is considered an important source of new viral genes including those likely to be involved in host range and those enabling the virus to interfere with the host immune response to infection. Given the low rate of nucleotide substitution, recombination can be seen as an essential evolutionary driving force although it is likely underestimated. Recombination in poxviruses is intimately linked to DNA replication with both viral and cellular proteins participate in this recombination-dependent replication. It has been shown, in other poxvirus genera, that recombination between isolates and perhaps even between species does occur, thereby providing another mechanism for the acquisition of new genes and for the rapid evolution of viruses. Such events may result in viruses that have a selective advantage over others, for example in re-infections (a characteristic of the PPV), or in viruses that are able to jump the species barrier and infect new hosts. Sequence data related to viral strains isolated from goats suggest that possible recombination events may have occurred between OV and PCPV (Ueda et al. 2003). The recombination events are frequent during poxvirus replication and comparative genomic analysis of several poxvirus species has revealed that recombinations occur frequently on the right terminal region. Intraspecific recombination can occur between strains of the same PPV species, but also interspecific recombination can happen depending on enough sequence similarity to enable recombination between distinct PPV species. The most important pre-requisite for a successful recombination is the coinfection of the individual host by different virus strains or species. Consequently, the following factors affecting the distribution of different viruses to shared target cells need to be considered: dose of inoculated virus, time interval between inoculation of the first and the second virus, distance between the marker mutations, genetic homology. At present there are no available data on the replication dynamics of PPV in permissive and non permissive hosts and reguarding co-infetions there are no information on the interference mechanisms occurring during the simultaneous replication of viruses of different species. This work has been carried out to set up permissive substrates allowing the replication of different PPV species, in particular keratinocytes monolayers and organotypic skin cultures. Furthermore a method to isolate and expand ovine skin stem cells was has been set up to indeep further aspects of viral cellular tropism during natural infection. The study produced important data to elucidate the replication dynamics of OV and PCPV virus in vitro as well as the mechanisms of interference that can arise during co-infection with different viral species. Moreover, the analysis carried on the genomic right terminal region of PCPV 1303 / 05 contributed to a better knowledge of the viral genes involved in host interaction and pathogenesis as well as to locate recombination breakpoints and genetic homologies between PPV species. Taken together these data filled several crucial gaps for the study of interspecific recombinations of PPVs which are thought to be important for a better understanding of the viral evolution and to improve the biosafety of antiviral therapy and PPV-based vectors. ...|$|E
