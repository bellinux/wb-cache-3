50|$|There {{are many}} ways that <b>paint</b> can <b>be</b> {{recycled}}. Most often, the highest quality of latex <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> sorted out and turned back into recycled <b>paint</b> that can <b>be</b> used. Recycled <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> environmentally preferable to new paint, while still maintaining comparable quality. In many cases, reusable paints of the same color are pumped into a tank where the material is mixed and tested. The <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> adjusted with additives and colorants as necessary. Finally, the <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> fine filtered and packaged for sale.|$|R
50|$|Metro {{receives}} post-consumer {{latex paint}} (PCLP) from garbage customers. Technicians inspect the paint for recyclability: recyclable <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> sorted by color, and unrecyclable <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> disposed in landfills. The recyclable <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> then color-corrected. Additives are blended in, and the <b>paint</b> <b>is</b> then filtered, performance tested, packaged into pails and cans, and sold {{back to the}} public at a price intended to recover the program’s labor and material costs.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of the {{automobile}} industry, <b>paint</b> <b>was</b> applied manually and dried for weeks at room temperature.

5|$|A Polish Nobleman is a 1637 {{painting}} by Rembrandt depicting {{a man in}} a costume of either Polish szlachta or boyar nobility.

The view that the figure's dress is clearly Polish is not universally held and {{it may have been a}} self-portrait.|$|E

50|$|In 1875, the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> {{purchased}} by the Bremen Art Society, although Gude incorrectly identifies them as the Stadtgalerie Bremen in his notes about the sale. In 1907 the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> transferred to the Kunsthalle Bremen. In 1920 the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> auctioned off {{due in part to}} changing tastes in art and the painting's large size (4.78 m2) which made it difficult to store. In 1932 the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> auctioned off again in Oslo where it was {{purchased by}} its current owner.|$|R
50|$|The <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> {{publicly}} {{sold for}} charity when Rockox died in 1640, {{but it is}} unknown who the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> sold to. In 1700, a panel named Samson and Delilah was bought by Prince Johann Adams Andreas I. This <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> likely Rubens' <b>painting.</b> However, when the <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> part of the Liechtenstein Collection in Vienna, Austria in the eighteenth century, the painter was identified as Jan van den Hoecke, who was a principal assistant of Rubens in the 1630's. The <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> then sold in 1880 in Paris, where it was later found by Ludwig Burchard in 1929. Eventually, the painting sold at auction in 1980 at Christie's, purchased by the National Gallery, London for $5 million.|$|R
5|$|Albrecht Goštautas (Olbracht Gasztołd), Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and voivode of Vilnius, {{is barely}} {{visible in the}} top right of the painting. His {{presence}} in the <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> intended to symbolize {{the wisdom of the}} king as a legislator.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the focal}} point of the <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the {{orthogonals}} in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts. Similar to Lopez-Rey, he describes three foci. The man in the doorway, however, is the vanishing point. More specifically, the crook of his arm is where the orthogonals of the windows and lights of the ceiling meet.|$|E

50|$|The <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> {{created in}} the summer of 1870, when Hūns participated in the Paris salon, and {{afterwards}} went to Normandy and then Belgium, where this <b>painting</b> <b>was</b> created.|$|R
5|$|<b>Painting</b> <b>is</b> {{a recent}} art form common among women artists. Famous artists include Yvette Bouquet from Koumac who has {{produced}} paintings with Pacific and Oceania themes, Paula Boi, whose paintings are of more abstract scenes, and Denise Tuvouane and Maryline Thydjepache who use mixed art forms. Bus stop shelters are common places where their paintings are illustrated.|$|E
5|$|The Kiss was {{exhibited}} in 1903 at Munch's show Love's Awakening, {{paired with a}} copy of his Madonna. The <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> now part of the collection of the Munch Museum in Oslo, Norway; the museum is dedicated to Munch and his works.|$|E
5|$|The {{commissioning}} aside, Delaroche {{was inspired}} to create Bonaparte Crossing the Alps because {{he felt that he}} both looked like Napoleon, and that his achievements were comparable to Napoleon's. It is likely that Delaroche's <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> relatively historically accurate; details such as Napoleon's clothes appear to have been researched by Delaroche in an effort at authenticity.|$|E

5|$|The <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> an austere but {{affecting}} {{portrayal of}} sorrow and grief. It shows four female and three male mourners grieving {{over the body}} of Christ.

5|$|The <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{described as}} {{the signing of the}} Declaration of Independence. In fact, the painting actually shows the five-man drafting committee presenting their draft of the Declaration to the Second Continental Congress, an event that took place on June 28, 1776, and not the signing of the document, which took place later.|$|E
5|$|The <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> {{today in}} the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., which was {{conceived}} by Pittsburgh financier Andrew Mellon in the late 1930s.

5|$|The {{panel is}} rich in Christian iconography, which {{reflects}} the shift in religious attitudes to a more meditative and solitary devotion in the 14th century, exemplified by the Devotio Moderna movement. The <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> devotional; its iconography clearly juxtaposes Old and New Testament imagery, conveying themes of punishment and redemption, against the belief that a second chance is available through the birth of Christ.|$|E
5|$|The {{pictorial}} {{composition of}} the <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> constructed upon two pyramidal structures. The perimeter of the large mast on {{the left of the}} canvas forms the first. The horizontal grouping of dead and dying figures in the foreground forms the base from which the survivors emerge, surging upward towards the emotional peak, where the central figure waves desperately at a rescue ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{provenance}} of the <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> unclear, {{and there}} is doubt as to which <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> referred to in some early inventories. An Anhalt prince, likely Leopold Friedrich Franz (d.1817) of Wörlitz, near Dessau, Germany, held it in the early 19th century, after which {{it is likely to}} have passed to Leopold Friedrich (d.1871). The painting was loaned for exhibition in 1902, when it was shown at the Hôtel de Gouvernement Provincial, Bruges at the Exposition des primitifs flamands et d'art ancien. It was held by a Duke of Anhalt until 1926 when he sold it to the art dealers Duveen Brothers. They in turn sold it that year to Andrew W. Mellon. It was loaned the following year to the Royal Academy of Arts, London, for an exhibition covering six centuries of Flemish and Belgian art. Mellon willed the work to his Educational and Charitable Trust in 1932, which in 1937 donated it to the National Gallery of Art where it is on permanent display.|$|E
