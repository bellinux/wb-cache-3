40|$|The {{freshwater}} {{zebra mussel}} Dreissena polymorpha {{is a powerful}} biofouling bivalve, which has tremendous impact on industrial facilities whose operation depends on the intensive use of freshwater, such as waterworks and power stations. The control of the pest in industrial environments remains a major challenge due to low selectivity over non-target organisms and {{the expense of the}} large quantities of biocides required. A novel delivery technique involving the encapsulation of a toxin within hundred micron-sized particles, edible for the bivalves, has been recently proposed. This strategy exploits the mussels’ filtration activity and minimises their avoidance responses to certain chemicals, resulting in an increase of their susceptibility to the biocide. In the present paper, which further develops this approach, a new, promising toxin-loaded particulate formulation is presented. The effectiveness of the product as a molluscicide has been demonstrated in laboratory bioassays. Encapsulation was observed {{to reduce the amount of}} biocide required to achieve 90 % mortality in a 12 -h treatment by a factor of approximately three.

Compared to other published methods, the present TEMOM requires the least computational time with much accuracy for predicting nanoparticle dynamics. The instantaneous results show that large eddies dominate the evolution of particulate dynamics as exhaust develops, while binary homogeneous sulfuric-water nucleation mainly appears at the interface between the exhaust and ambient cool gases. The increasing of fuel sulfur content and relative humidity or the decreasing of environment temperature leads to an increase in <b>particulate</b> <b>product</b> rate, while volume-averaged particle diameter increases with increasing fuel sulfur content and environment temperature.

Particulate bioproducts, such as crystals, inclusion bodies, virus-like particles and precipitates, can be produced inside microbial cells. Selective recovery of these products by physical means requires cell disintegration for release of the <b>particulate</b> <b>product</b> into the fermentation medium. This issue was addressed in a case study on the release of medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (mcl-PHA) inclusion bodies from Pseudomonas putida cells using mechanical, enzymatic and combined chemical/mechanical disruption. Purification of the PHA inclusion bodies from the enzymatically-disintegrated broth using dissolved-air flotation was feasible under conditions where the inclusion bodies were selectively aggregated, i. e. in their iso-electric point. Model systems of protein-coated (BSA, casein and lysozyme) polystyrene particles of approximately 1 mm were applied {{to get a better}} understanding of the requirements for particle-particle separation using dissolved-air flotation. The attachment efficiency of the protein-coated particles to the air-bubbles was dominated by particle aggregation and kinetic effects in the adsorption process. Particle aggregation showed to be essential for efficient separation of the protein-coated polystyrene particles. The conditions required for particle aggregation were explained on the basis of the Van der Waals, hydrophobic, electrostatic and steric interaction forces between the particles. Particle trajectory analysis was employed to calculate the influence of hydrodynamics, colloidal interaction forces and particle size on the aggregation efficiency and selectivity in bioparticle mixtures.

40|$|Many {{chemical}} and environmental processes involve {{the formation of}} a polydispersed particulate phase in a turbulent carrier flow. Frequently, the immersed particles are characterized by an intrinsic property such as the particle size, and the distribution of this property across a sample population is taken as an indicator for the quality of the <b>particulate</b> <b>product</b> or its environmental impact. In the present article, we propose a comprehensive model and an efficient numerical solution scheme for predicting the evolution of the property distribution associated with a polydispersed particulate phase forming in a turbulent reacting flow. Here, the particulate phase is described in terms of the particle number density whose evolution in both physical and particle property space is governed by the population balance equation (PBE). Based on the concept of large eddy simulation (LES), we augment the existing LES-transported probability density function (PDF) approach for fluid phase scalars by the particle number density and obtain a modeled evolution equation for the filtered PDF associated with the instantaneous fluid composition and particle property distribution. This LES-PBE-PDF approach allows us to predict the LES-filtered fluid composition and particle property distribution at each spatial location and point in time without any restriction on the chemical or particle formation kinetics. In view of a numerical solution, we apply the method of Eulerian stochastic fields, invoking an explicit adaptive grid technique in order to discretize the stochastic field equation for the number density in particle property space. In this way, sharp moving features of the particle property distribution can be accurately resolved at a significantly reduced computational cost. As a test case, we consider the condensation of an aerosol in a developed turbulent mixing layer. Our investigation not only demonstrates the predictive capabilities of the LES-PBE-PDF model but also indicates the computational efficiency of the numerical solution scheme...|$|E
40|$|Crystallization is an {{essential}} step in many processes in chemical industries, ranging from bulk chemicals to special products. It is a separation and purification technique that results in a solid <b>particulate</b> <b>product,</b> which is generally preferred in the pharmaceutical industry. The crystal product quality {{is determined by the}} specific crystal form (polymorph) crystallized, and by the crystal size, morphology and purity. It depends heavily on the process conditions under which crystal nucleation occurs. During the crystal nucleation event, parameters that are essential for the product quality, in particular the polymorph formed, are not very well established. The nucleation event is still poorly understood and is therefore difficult to control and optimize. Crystal nucleation sets the initial crystal size distribution at the start of unseeded batch crystallization processes and is the first and most important step in this process (Chapter 1). A fundamental understanding of crystal nucleation is needed for the rigorous control and prediction of the crystalline product quality of any crystallization processes on industrial scale. Also the lead compounds in pharmaceutical industry become more and more complex. As a result crystallization research becomes increasingly fundamental while model compounds have shifted from bulk chemicals to high added-value chemicals. A fundamental understanding of molecular processes during crystallization is becoming increasingly important not in the least when applied on an industrial scale. In this thesis we improve the knowledge and understanding of crystal nucleation of organic compounds from solution. The research starts with comparing two newly developed methods to measure heterogeneous nucleation kinetics by determining crystal nucleation rates in stirred solutions (Chapter 2). Both methods make use of the stochastic nature of crystal nucleation by determining and analysing the variation in nucleation kinetic measurements. The values of the kinetic parameter (A) obtained in the present thesis are low compared to the theoretical values. This could be due to both a lower than expected attachment frequency of building units to the nucleus and a lower than expected concentration of active nucleation sites (heterogeneous particles) in the solution. It was further identified that the single nucleus mechanism, in which all crystals in the suspension originate from the same parent single crystal, might occur more generally than is currently recognized, even in larger volumes. In this thesis we used concomitant polymorphism as a tool to validate this single nucleus mechanism (Chapter 3). The single nucleus mechanism has important implications for the control of industrial crystallization processes of polymorphic compounds. In terms of crystal size distribution, control can be obtained by controlling the secondary rather than the primary nucleation event for which completely different control procedures are needed. In terms of polymorphism, the control can be achieved by controlling the primary nucleation event that leads to the single crystal, which in turn defines the crystal form of the secondary nuclei. One of the major challenges the pharmaceutical industry is faced in production, where often during cooling crystallization the product separates not as crystals but as a viscous liquid. This phenomenon is referred to as oiling out or liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). The effect of LLPS on the crystallization of 4 -hydroxyacetophenon (4 HAP) in water, water-ethanol mixtures and ethyl acetate solutions were shown in Chapter 4. For HAP, the LLPS is a stable region above the saturation temperature of 52 °C, 36 °C and 30 °C of 4 HAP in water, water-ethanol (90 - 10 wt%) and water-ethanol (80 - 20 wt%) mixtures, respectively. Cooling crystallization experiments always resulted into mixtures of polymorphic fractions if the LLPS preceded 4 HAP crystallization. The results suggest that the crystallization behavior is strongly influenced by the presence of this LLPS. Due to the LLPS the nucleation may proceed on the droplet surface and the single nucleus mechanism does not hold anymore. The crystallization within the LLPS region seems to lead to agglomeration of the particles. One of the causes for the low kinetic parameter A of the nucleation rate equation was identified in Chapter 3 to be the building units that attach to the nucleus and thus determine the attachment frequency. The effect of these solution-building units or associates in solution was investigated in Chapter 5. The model compound used was isonicotinamide, which has an amide group that can form both homosynthons and heterosynthons by self-association. We show that, in a controlled and reproducible way, specific solvents lead to specific polymorphic forms of isonicotinamide. We argue on the basis of Raman and FTIR spectroscopy that the hydrogen bonding (self-association) in solution kinetically drives the nucleation towards a specific form. The self-association in solution reflects the crystal structure of the obtained polymorph. The method based on self-association of molecules in solution may help in reproducible production of polymorphs. In chapter 6 we propose a polymorph screening method based on the identification of crystal building units using Raman, FTIR and NMR techniques. We demonstrated this new approach by relating the structural outcome of the crystallization process of Isonicotinamide (INA), Nicotinamide (NA), Picolinamide (PA), Carbamazepine (CBZ) and Diprophylline (DPL) to the association and self-association processes in solutions, which are largely influenced by the hydrogen bonding capacity of the solvent. The screening method based on the identification of crystal building units may help to discover new polymorphs. The self-association method offers the ability to identify solvents or solvent mixtures that promote or avoid the presence of specific building units and in this way control the building unit towards polymorphs having specific structural features. As identified in chapter 3, another cause for the low kinetic factor in nucleation is the heterogeneous particle. Nothing is known about the actual concentration and functionality of these heterogeneous particles while they tremendously affect nucleation behavior. We therefore investigated the interplay between self-associates in solution and well-defined heterogeneous template surface by studying the crystallization behavior of isonicotinamide (INA) and 2, 6 -dihydroxy benzoic acid (DHB) (Chapter 7). Well-defined templates were prepared by making Self-Assembled Monolayers (SAM) onto a gold surface. The self-association of INA and DHB were investigated using spectroscopic techniques. Raman spectroscopy of the crystal-template surface after template crystallization suggests that molecular interactions between INA or DHB associates and the SAM are responsible for the formation of specific polymorphs. XRPD helped in the identification of the crystal orientation on the template surface further verifying the importance of solute interactions with the functionalized template surface. The systematic analysis of the association processes in solutions and the interplay with well-defined templates is beneficial in the development of polymorph discovery and preparation methods as well as control over crystallization processes. Industrially, the thesis results may not only help to discover new polymorphs but can also help in reproducible industrial production of polymorphs. On Industrial scale seeding approaches using only a single crystal can lead to the avoidance of primary nucleation and thus control over the polymorph obtained. The combination of well-defined template surfaces and the self-association method {{can be used as a}} screening method in the early drug discovery and development phase but also define robust conditions for industrial crystallization of polymorphs. This will not only help to discover and reproducibly prepare polymorphs, but a more comprehensive screening can be performed at reduced cost. Industries can implement the results to improve crystal product qualities and can also discover and optimize the quality of new crystal products by incorporating the methods in the development process. Scientifically, this thesis opened the route towards a thorough study of heterogeneous nucleation of polymorphic compounds taking into account self-association, template effects and relative stability of polymorphs. Such a study would result in an accurate molecular interpretation of crystal nucleation and would finally enable the validation of heterogeneous nucleation theories. As analytical techniques become more and more powerful, finding new and better ways to powerful insights in the crystal nucleation research become easier. Utilization of these principles and tools not only allow studying crystal nucleation, but also allows the understanding of nucleation processes to a new level. Molecular simulations are still needed to bridge the gap between solution chemistry and crystal nucleation rate analysis to come to a molecular interpretation of crystal nucleation of organic compounds. The new experimental approaches described in this thesis will boost the existing methods for polymorph prediction and in particular for predicting the conditions for polymorph formation.

The faecal pellets of copepods are covered by a peritrophic membrane and have a highly variable size and content. There is less information on {{the nature of}} other copepod <b>particulate</b> <b>products.</b> The weight-specific rates of posthatch mortality, respiration, excretion, and faecal pellet production have similar C or N levels and are higher than those of moulting and egg mortality. In general, most important factors controlling these rates are temperature, body mass, food concentration, food quality, and faunistic composition. Physical and biological factors govern the vertical fate of copepod products by affecting their sedimentation speed and concentration gradient. The physical factors are sinking speed, advection, stratification, turbulent diffiusion, and molecular diffusion. They influence the sedimentation speed and degradation of the copepod products. The biological factors are production, biodegradation (by zooplankton, nekton, and microorganisms) and vertical migration of copepods (diel or seasonal). Physical degradation and biodegradation by zooplankton and nekton are faster than biodegradation by microorganisms. The most important copepod outfluxes are excretion and fecal pellet production.

Controlling the particle production process to obtain required attributes will be greatly facilitated using robust algorithms providing {{the size and}} shape information of the particles from in situ measurements. However, obtaining particle size and shape information in situ during manufacturing has been a big challenge. This is because the problem of estimating particle size and shape (aspect ratio) from signals provided by in-line measuring tools is often ill posed, and therefore it calls for appropriate constraints to be imposed on the problem. One way to constrain uncertainty in estimation of particle size and shape from in-line measurements is to combine data from different measurements such as chord length distribution (CLD) and imaging.

The work utilizes the unique SiH 4 /C 2 H 2 combustion system which generates <b>particulate</b> <b>products</b> ranging from high purity, white SiC to carbonaceous soot depending on equivalence ratio (Ref. 1). A goal of this work is to identify gas phase or particle formation processes that provide the enthalpy release needed to drive the combustion wave, and to locate the steps of the particle formation process that determine SiC stoichiometry and crystallinity. In a real sense, these SiH 4 /C 2 H 2 flames act like highly sooty hydrocarbon flames, but with simpler chemistry. This simplification is expected to allow them to be used as surrogates to advance understanding of soot formation in such rich hydrocarbon flames. It is also expected that this improved understanding of SiC particle generation and evolution in these self-sustaining flames will advance the commercial potential of the flame process for the generation of high purity SiC powders...|$|R
40|$|A fast, reliable, and {{low-cost}} {{characterization of}} <b>particulate</b> <b>products</b> as fed to a process, and/or resulting from different processing actions, {{represents one of}} the most challenging targets in the particulate solids handling sector. An adequate response of the industry to the market can only be given through the utilization of equipment and procedures ensuring pure, high-quality production, and efficient work and cost. All these goals can be reached by adopting not only more efficient equipment and layouts, but also by introducing new processing logics able of realizing full control of the flow stream characteristics of the handled material. Today, thanks to strong technological development, different techniques are available according to different sampling strategies and analytical principles to detect specific physicochemical attributes of particles. These represent the key factor in performing full process monitoring and/or applying specific control/tuning actions to the process itself. In this paper the principles and possibilities offered by the adoption of specialized devices allowing the development of online acquisition/processing strategies, based on chemical (or hyperspectral) imaging and finalized to perform particulate solid stream characterization, inspection, and quality control actions, are investigated and discussed...|$|R
40|$|A full target {{oriented}} {{fine and}} ultrafine particles systems characterization represents an hard task to reach. Such a difficulty is mainly {{linked to the}} problems arising when, starting from a full analysis of single particles properties (i. e. size, shape, surface characteristics and density) a correlation with their behaviour in bulk has to be established. In this paper an innovative approach is proposed in order to detect and quantify the overall attributes of fine and ultrafine particles resulting from different processes and characterized by different particle characteristics. The proposed approach is based on: a 2 D-fractal analysis of fine and ultrafine particles population acquired as digital images. This approach allows to perform a full measurement and control of fine particles structure and texture by evaluating statistical fractal parameters {{on the base of}} the topological assessment of the particles on a flat surface. The work was developed with the aim to develop and implement a reliable and simple tool to use for <b>particulate</b> <b>products</b> characterization and recognition able to correlate the characteristics of fine particles detected by the proposed logics and those usually extracted by using classic methods...|$|R
40|$|Ultrafine {{particles}} generated during polymer thermodegradation are a {{major health}} hazard, owing to their unique pathway of processing in the lung. This hazard in manned spacecraft is poorly understood, because the <b>particulate</b> <b>products</b> of polymer thermodegradation are generated under low gravity conditions. Particulate generated from the degradation of PolyTetraFluoroEthylene (PTFE), insulation coating for 20 AWG copper wire (representative of spacecraft application) under intense ohmic heating were studied in terrestrial gravity and microgravity. Microgravity tests were done in a 1. 2 -second drop tower at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM). Thermophoretic sampling was used for particulate collection. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) were {{used to examine the}} smoke particulates. Image software was used to calculate particle size distribution. In addition to gravity, the color of PTFE insulation has an overwhelming effect on size, shape and morphology of the particulate. Nanometer-sized primary particles were found in all cases, and aggregation and size distribution was dependent on both color and gravity; higher aggregation occurred in low gravity. Particulates from white, black, red and yellow colored PTFE insulations were studied. Elemental analysis of the particulates shows the presence of inorganic pigments...|$|R
40|$|Pirimiphos-methyl (PMM) is {{a widely}} used {{pesticide}} that can be released into {{the atmosphere in the}} gas phase and the condensed phase. The reaction of suspended PMM particles with ozone is investigated using an online vacuum ultraviolet photoionization aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (VUV-ATOFMS) and a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). The reactions are conducted in an 180 L reaction chamber. The identification of <b>particulate</b> <b>products</b> detected with VUV-ATOFMS is proposed on the basis of GC-MS analysis of PMM ozonation products in methylene dichloride solution. The heterogeneous reactive rate constant of PMM with azelaic acid as matrix under room temperature (293 +/- K) is (1. 97 +/- 0. 25) x 10 (- 17) cm(3) molecules(- 1) s(- 1). The corresponding lifetime at 100 ppbv of ozone is 5. 2 +/- 0. 66 h, and the reactive uptake coefficient (gamma) for ozone on PMM particles is (8. 5 +/- 1. 1) x 10 (- 4). Additionally, ozonation of PMM vapor is conducted, and the rapid formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is observed in the homogeneous ozonation of gas-phase PMM. The experimental results indicate that ozone is an important atmospheric oxidant for the transformation of PMM in the atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{processing}} of <b>particulate</b> <b>products</b> across various manufacturing steps requires that particles possess desired attributes such as size and shape. Controlling the particle production process to obtain required attributes will be greatly facilitated using robust algorithms providing {{the size and}} shape information of the particles from in situ measurements. However, obtaining particle size and shape information in situ during manufacturing has been a big challenge. This is because the problem of estimating particle size and shape (aspect ratio) from signals provided by in-line measuring tools is often ill posed, and therefore it calls for appropriate constraints to be imposed on the problem. One way to constrain uncertainty in estimation of particle size and shape from in-line measurements is to combine data from different measurements such as chord length distribution (CLD) and imaging. This paper presents two different methods for combining imaging and CLD data obtained with in-line tools in order to get reliable estimates of particle size distribution and aspect ratio, where the imaging data is used to constrain the search space for an aspect ratio from the CLD data.

Modified full length 30 S RNAs and unmodified RNA were reconstituted for various time periods with TMV protein. The <b>particulate</b> <b>products</b> were separated by ultracentrifugation, and the amounts of virus-like material were quantitated by UV spectrophotometry. The length distribution and general appearance of the virus-like rods were studied by electron microscopy. Neither type of carcinogen prevented typical rod formation, but the rate of formation and the maximal yield of reconstituted particles diminished with increasing modification by both agents. The rod length distribution also showed progressively lesser numbers of full-length virus rods. The particulate material contained approximately {{the same number of}} adducts as the modified RNA. Thus, it appears that these carcinogen modifications of guanine residues at the N- 2 or C- 8 atoms did not prevent orderly protein assembly on the RNA but instead slowed up this process and frequently stopped it, possibly at sites where adducts happen to be clustered...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT − Over the years, {{nanoparticle}} {{drug delivery}} systems have demonstrated versatile potentials in biological, medical and pharmaceutical applications. In {{the pharmaceutical industry}} nanotechnology research has mainly focused on providing controlled drug release, targeting their delivery to specific organs, and developing parenteral formulations for poorly water soluble drugs to improve their bioavailability. Achievement in polymer industry has generated numerous poly-mers applicable to designing nanoparticles. From viewpoints of product development, a nanocarrier material should meet requirements for biodegradability, biocompatibility, availability, and regulatory approval crieteria. Albumin is indeed a mate-rial that fulfills such requirements. Also, the commercialization of a first albumin-bound paclitaxel nanoparticle product (AbraxaneTM) has sparked renewed interests {{in the application of}} albumin in the development of nanoparticle formulations. This paper reviews the intrinsic properties of albumin, its suitability as a nanocarrier material, and albumin-based parenteral formulation approaches. Particularly discussed in detail are albumin-based particulate injectables such as AbraxaneTM. Infor-mation on key roles of albumin in the nab ™ technology and representative manufacturing processes of albumin <b>particulate</b> <b>products</b> are provided. It is likely that albumin-based particulate technology would extend its applications in delivering drugs, polypeptides, proteins, vaccines, nucleic acids, and genes.

40|$|Atmospheric {{oxidation}} of monoterpenes {{contributes to}} formation of tropospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosol, but their products are poorly characterized. In this work, we report {{a series of}} outdoor smog chamber experiments to investigate both gaseous and <b>particulate</b> <b>products</b> in the ozone oxidation of four monoterpenes: alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, Delta(3) -carene, and sabinene. More than ten oxygenated products are detected and identified in each monoterpene/O- 3 reaction by coupling derivatization techniques and GC/MS detection. A denuder/filter pack sampling system is used to separate and simultaneously collect gas and aerosol samples. The identified products, consisting of compounds containing carbonyl, hydroxyl, and carboxyl functional groups, are estimated to account for about 34 - 50 %, 57 %, 29 - 67 %, and 24 % of the reacted carbon mass for beta-pinene, sabinene, alpha-pinene, and Delta(3) -carene, respectively. The identified individual products account for > 83 %, similar to 100 %, > 90 %, and 61 % of the aerosol mass produced in the ozone reaction of beta-pinene, sabinene, alpha-pinene, and Delta(3) -carene. The uncertainty in the yield data {{is estimated to be}} similar to +/- 50 %. Many of the products partition between gas and aerosol phases, and their gas-aerosol partitioning coefficients are determined and reported here. Reaction schemes are suggested to account for the products observed...|$|R
