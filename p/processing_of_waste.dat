50|$|A waste {{autoclave}} {{is a form}} {{of solid}} waste treatment that uses heat, steam and pressure of an industrial autoclave in the <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste.</b> Waste autoclaves process waste either in batches or in continuous-flow processes.

The steam pressure in the vessel is maintained up to 6 bar (gauge) for a period of up to 45 minutes to allow the process to fully 'cook' the waste. The autoclave process gives a very high pathogen and virus kill rate, although the fibrous products which come from the process are susceptible to bacteria and fungus as they are high in starch, cellulose and amino acids.|$|E

Biotreatment, the <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> using living organisms, is an environmentally friendly, relatively simple and cost-effective alternative to physico-chemical clean-up options.

The great versatility {{in the design of}} confined environments allows the treatment of a wide range <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> under optimized conditions. To perform a correct assessment, it is necessary to consider various microorganisms having a variety of genomes and expressed transcripts and proteins. A great number of analyses are often required. Using traditional genomic techniques, such assessments are limited and time-consuming. However, several high-throughput techniques originally developed for medical studies can be applied to assess biotreatment in confined environments.|$|R
