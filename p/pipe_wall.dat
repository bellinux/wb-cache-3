Precast {{thin-wall}} {{steel and}} spun concrete composite pile (TSC pile) {{is a kind}} of new type of steel-concrete composite pile whose bearing performance is between steel pile and concrete pile. This article adopted FEM software to set up 3 D TSC pile model to analyze its performance. Through the comparison with actual pure bending bearing experiment results, the model’s reliability was verified and the results showed that the model was reliable. Then lots of bending bearing capacity contrast calculations were conducted by using different cross section parameters (outside diameter, concrete <b>pipe’s</b> <b>wall</b> thickness and steel <b>pipe’s</b> <b>wall</b> thickness), and the influences of these parameters on bending resistance of TSC pile were discussed. The results showed that: with the increase of outside diameter, concrete <b>pipe’s</b> <b>wall</b> thickness and steel <b>pipe’s</b> <b>wall</b> thickness, TSC pile’s ultimate flexural bearing capacity increased. The influences of different parameters were not the same, outside diameter was the most important parameter, then concrete <b>pipe’s</b> <b>wall</b> thickness, and the last one was steel <b>pipe’s</b> <b>wall</b> thickness...|$|R

The fracture resistance of the joints without welding defects was studied by a fracture test too.

40|$|The {{methodology}} of coupling large eddy simulation (LES) with the discrete element method {{was applied for}} computational studies of pneumatic transport of granular materials through vertical and horizontal pipes {{in the presence of}} electrostatic effects. The LES numerical results obtained agreed well with the law of the wall for various y+-ranges. The simulations showed that a thin layer of particles formed and remained adhered to the <b>pipe</b> <b>walls</b> during the pneumatic conveying process due to the effects of strong electrostatic forces of attraction toward the <b>pipe</b> <b>walls.</b> Particle concentrations were generally higher near the <b>pipe</b> <b>walls</b> than at the pipe center resulting in the ring flow pattern observed in previous experimental studies. The close correspondence between particle velocity vectors and fluid drag force vectors was indicative of the importance of fluid drag forces in influencing particle behaviors. In contrast, the much weaker particleparticle electrostatic repulsion forces had negligible effects on particle behaviors within the system under all operating conditions considered. The electrostatic field strength developed during pneumatic conveying increased with decreasing flow rate due to increased amount of particle-wall collisions. Based on dynamic analyses of forces acting on individual particles, it may be concluded that electrostatic effects played a dominant role in influencing particle behaviors during pneumatic conveying at low flow rates, whereas drag forces became more important at high flow rates.
