40|$|ABSTRACT Following the {{promulgation}} {{of the new}} nation-state in 1932, the Saudi Arabian government embarked upon modernizing {{its traditional}} society. Political stability and improved economic conditions {{made possible by the}} increasing oil revenues, resulted in unprecedented demographic increases and rapid urbanization. The government spearheaded the process of introducing modern building techniques and centralized financing supplanting the traditional methods of design and construction. However, since the drop in oil prices in the early 1980 s, the central government has cut back on its commitment to housing. Due to the government’s shrinking role in the housing market and underdeveloped housing <b>private</b> <b>sector,</b> <b>custom</b> built and owner financed housing has taken several forms in response to the increasing demand for new and affordable housing. In this paper, I shed light on historical developments and salient cultural attributes of the Saudi population. The emerging political economy and the national policy framework upon which the housing policy was established is briefly discussed. The paper evaluates housing policy application in Saudi Arabia and presents a typology of conventionally built housing forms and assesses their implications. I explore current regulatory policies and codes governing the construction and financing of contemporary dwellings. The paper identifies changes in type, form and design of contemporary dwellings and in the socio-economic characteristics of home building. I argue that a major element in a successful approach to housing policy must take into account salient cultural attributes, prevalent family structure and financing methods...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the deliberations {{at a meeting}} convened by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation held in Beijing in October 2015. Farm power and mechanization are agricultural production inputs that will be essential to raise the labor and land productivity required if Sustainable Development Goals 1 and 2 (ending poverty and hunger) are to be achieved. The smallholder farm sector demand for mechanization needs to be raised to stimulate the product value chain and activate input supply (that is to raise farm productivity, stimulate value addition, and encourage <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> <b>custom</b> hire service provision). The sustainability of mechanization from a natural resource conservation {{point of view is}} discussed with reference to conservation agriculture principles. Mechanization appropriate for the smallholder sector covers the range of possible power sources human, draft animal and motorized. The key is to engage all the stakeholders in the supply chain and offer a range of suitable options from which the user can select. Sustainability of mechanization includes financial and social, as well as environmental factors. Local manufacturers should be supported where feasible as they can provide implements and machines adapted to local conditions—and better technical service and replacement part supply. The public sector role in providing access to mechanization should be restricted to promulgating enabling policies, building technical and business management skills and stimulating demand. The lessons to be learnt from Chinese experience in making mechanization available to smallholder farmers include subsidies, strong extension services, infrastructure development and a solid manufacturing sector that prioritizes the smallholder sector. The implications for sub-Saharan Africa appear to be that group ownership and custom hire service provision are the models to follow. Finally, the relevance of an African Center for Sustainable Agricultural Mechanization, on the model of CSAM in Beijing, is considered and recommended...|$|R

40|$|The declining Zimbabwean {{economy has}} {{resulted}} in corruption reaching epidemic proportions. There is a high tolerance for it in society as {{it is seen as}} {{the only way to get}} timely service or any service at all especially in the public sector which is infested with petty corruption. Through some examples this paper reveals that in the education, health, justice, transport and <b>custom</b> <b>sectors</b> it is common to find public servants charging extra for services, seeking small favours, or using pubic facilities and materials for their own marginal personal gain. Payment of a bribes is now a normal and accepted way of doing business and is no longer viewed by most as an immoral act. Whilst the causes of this petty or bureaucratic corruption can be easily identified it is important to understand the nature and culture of corruption, how it moves from one level to the next. This paper uses an agency model of corruption whose setup has been widely cited and serves as a foundation for empirical research and policy design to combat bureaucratic corruption to show that the public officials rationally make a choice to be corrupt by weighing key determinants which are, the return of corruption against public wage levels, the penalty and probability of being detected. Paying particular attention to the <b>customs</b> <b>sector</b> this paper uses the multi-equilibria model by Andvig and Moene, (1989) “How corruption may corrupt” to show that the increase in the bribe price in the short-run beyond a certain level may result in a shift to a high level corruption equilibrium which is reversible if the bribe price decreases beyond a certain level. However in the long-run this reversal may be difficult and the sector may be stuck in the high level corruption equilibrium. The ratchet effects of corruption in both the supply and demand may result in its continuity and movement towards full corruption in some parts of the <b>customs</b> <b>sector...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{sale tax}} rebate program has existed in states along the U.

No empirical research exists, though, that provides insight into the statistical relationships between the Texas retail sector and total certificates issued by <b>Private</b> <b>Customs</b> Brokers (PCBs) in border cities. This study fills this research gap by creating a model that tests the statistical significance of real retail sales on total certificates issued in Texas. Data in this thesis suggest that, in border cities, an increase in real retail sales dollars does not suggest an increase of sales tax rebate certificates issued by PCBs in these cities. The history and the current state of legislation for the program is also discussed, which provides the sufficient context for the behavioral model discussed within. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{origin of}} Compline {{has given rise}} to {{considerable}} discussion among liturgists. In the past, general opinion ascribed the origin of this Hour to St. Benedict, {{in the beginning of the}} 6th century. But Jules Pargoire and A. Vandepitte trace its source to St. Basil. Vandepitte states that it was not in Cæsarea in 375, but in his retreat in Pontus (358-362), that Basil established Compline, which Hour did not exist prior to his time, that is, until shortly after the middle of the 4th century. Dom Plaine also traced the source of Compline back to the 4th century, finding mention of it in a passage in Eusebius and in another in St. Ambrose, and also in John Cassian.These texts bear witness to the <b>private</b> <b>custom</b> of saying a prayer before retiring to rest. If this was not the canonical Hour of Compline, it was certainly a preliminary step towards it. The same writers reject the opinion of Paulin Ladeuze and Dom Besse who believe that Compline had a place in the Rule of St. Pachomius, which would mean that it originated still earlier in the 4th century.|$|R
