50|$|Sandside Bay is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is {{recognised}} by surfers {{as being}} {{home to a}} powerful high quality left-hand reef break. This, however, is extremely fickle, and requires very particular wind, swell, and tide conditions to come into shape. The break is also notorious for being very rocky, shallow, and dangerous, such is the irregular form of the reef upon which the wave breaks. One of the main environmental issues caused by the Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establishment are radioactive nuclear fuel particles that have been released from the site into the sea, and {{are now on the}} seabed near the plant and in Sandside Bay. Some of these are being washed ashore, including a small number on the privately owned Sandside Bay beach which {{is open to the public}} and is part of the 10000 acre Sandside Estate. The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs committed to clean up and open oversight of the work on 25 October 2006. http://www.sandsideestate.com/pressRelease.asp?releaseId=537 The Dounreay Particles Advisory Group recommended that the <b>particle</b> <b>monitoring</b> frequency of the beach should be increased to fortnightly. http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectionCode=132&storyCode=2040484. The 13th Laird of Sandside the Duke of Portland took the Government to Court to assert his ownership down to the low watermark of the estate granted by a barony of 1628 and won. The 19th Laird of Sandside since 1991, Geoffrey Minter, following the radioactive contamination beginning in 1997, took the Government owned UKAEA to court in 2003 and won, beyond appeal, a judicial review in Scotland's highest court proving radioactive damage to the estate's land and the UKAEA to be in breach of its statutory duty under the Nuclear Installations Act. UKAEA's contractors now regularly monitor the beach due to a permanent agreement with the landowner.|$|E
40|$|Oil debris sensors are {{effective}} tools to monitor wear particles in lubricants. For in situ applications, surrounding {{noise and vibration}} interferences often distort the oil debris signature of the sensor. Hence extracting oil debris signatures from sensor signals is a challenging task for wear <b>particle</b> <b>monitoring.</b> In this paper we employ the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) with optimal decomposition depth to enhance the wear <b>particle</b> <b>monitoring</b> capability. The sensor signal is decomposed by the MODWT into different depths for detecting the wear particle existence. To extract the authentic particle signature with minimal distortion, the {{root mean square deviation}} of kurtosis value of the segmented signal residue is adopted as a criterion to obtain the optimal decomposition depth for the MODWT. The proposed approach is evaluated using both simulated and experimental wear particles. The results show that the present method can improve the oil debris monitoring capability without structural upgrade requirements...|$|E

40|$|In {{developing}} countries, {{high levels}} of particle pollution {{from the use of}} coal and biomass fuels for household cooking and heating are a major cause of ill health and premature mortality. The cost and complexity of existing monitoring equipment, combined with the need to sample many locations, make routine quantification of household particle pollution levels difficult. Recent advances in technology, however, have enabled the development of a small, portable, data-logging <b>particle</b> <b>monitor</b> modified from commercial smoke alarm technology that can meet the needs of surveys in the developing world at reasonable cost. Laboratory comparisons of a prototype <b>particle</b> <b>monitor</b> developed at the University of California at Berkeley (UCB) with gravimetric filters, a tapered element oscillating microbalance, and a TSI DustTrak to quantify the UCB <b>particle</b> <b>monitor</b> response as a function of both concentration and particle size and to examine sensor response in relation to changes in temperature, relative humidity, and elevation are presented here. UCB <b>particle</b> <b>monitors</b> showed good linearity in response to different concentrations of laboratory-generated oleic acid aerosols with a coarse (mass median diameter, 2. 1 25 m) and fine (mass median diameter, 0. 27 - 0. 42 25 m) size distributions (average r 2 = 0. 997 21 0. 005). The photoelectric and ionization chamber showed a wide range of responses based on particle size and, thus, require calibration with the aerosol of interest. The ionization chamber was five times more sensitive to fine rather than coarse particles, whereas the photoelectric chamber was five times more sensitive to coarse than fine. The ratio of the response between the two sensors has the potential for mass calibration of individual data points based on estimated parameters of the size distribution. The results demonstrate the significant potential of this monitor, which will facilitate the evaluation of interventions (improved fuels, stoves, and ventilation) on indoor air pollution levels and research on the impacts of indoor particle levels on health in developing countries...|$|R

30|$|It may be {{appropriate}} to consider PQ of hot cells in conjunction with OQ, {{as there is no}} significant difference in their mode of operation during the preparation of the RPs or at rest. On the other hand, this is not true in case of manual or semi-automated operations, when manipulations may affect laminar flow pattern, e.g. due to the movement of the operating personnel arms through the gloves. Thus, the above test should be executed both at rest (OQ) and “in operation” (PQ). As for <b>particle</b> <b>monitoring,</b> it has to be noted that radioactivity may strongly influence the instrument response, as radiation pulses may be erroneously “counted” by the <b>particle</b> <b>monitoring</b> system, and thus particle contamination may be overestimated. Keeping this in mind, for hot cells dedicated to automated preparation or dispensing operations, PQ tests should be performed during their normal work cycles (e.g. during the preparation or the dispensing of the intended radiopharmaceuticals). In case of hot cells used for manual RP preparations, which are typically performed by personnel through suitable sealed gloves, PQ tests should be performed during normal workflow (e.g. during the preparation of Tc- 99  m labelled kits).|$|E

40|$|The Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) carries {{instruments}} that must switch off high voltages (HV) when {{passing through the}} South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). The High Energy X-ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE) contains a <b>particle</b> <b>monitor</b> that detects the increased particle flux associated with the SAA and autonomously reduces its voltage. The Proportional Counter Array (PCA) relies on uplinked predictions of SAA entry/exit times based on ephemeris data provided by the Flight Dynamics Facility. A third instrument, the All-Sky Monitor (ASM) also uses a predicted SAA model to reduce voltage when passing through the SAA. Data collected from the HEXTE <b>particle</b> <b>monitor,</b> {{as well as other}} instrument readings near the times of SAA entry/exit offer the potential for refining models of the boundaries of the SAA. The SAA has an increased particle flux which causes high rates of detection in the RXTE instruments designed to observe x-rays. The high counting rates could degrade the PCA if HV is not reduced during SAA passages. On the other hand, PCA downtime can be minimized and the science return can be optimized by having the best possible model of the SAA boundary. Thus, the PCA team planned an extensive effort during in-orbit checkout to utilize both the HEXTE <b>particle</b> <b>monitor</b> data and instrument counting rates to refine the model of the SAA boundary. The times of SAA entry and exit are compared with the definitive epemeris to determine the precise location (latitude and longitude) of the SAA boundary. Over time, the SAA and its perimeter were mapped. The RXTE Science Operations Center is continuously working to feed back the results of this effort into the science scheduling process, improving the SAA model as it affects the RXTE instruments, thus obtaining more accurate estimates of the SAA entry/exit times...|$|R

40|$|Electrostatic sensor arrays (ESAs) are {{promising}} in industrial applications related to charged <b>particle</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Sensitivity {{is a fundamental}} and commonly-used sensing characteristic of an ESA. However, the usually used spatial sensitivity, which is called static sensitivity here, is not proper for moving particles or capable of reflecting array signal processing algorithms integrated in an ESA. Besides, reports on ESAs for intermittent particles are scarce yet, especially lacking suitable array signal processing algorithms. To solve the problems, the dynamic sensitivity of ESA is proposed, and a hemisphere-shaped electrostatic sensors’ circular array (HSESCA) along with its application in intermittent <b>particle</b> <b>monitoring</b> are taken as an example. In detail, a sensing model of the HSESCA is built. On this basis, its array signals are analyzed; the dynamic sensitivity is thereupon defined by analyzing the processing of the array signals. Besides, a component extraction-based array signal processing algorithm for intermittent particles is proposed, and the corresponding dynamic sensitivity is analyzed quantitatively. Moreover, simulated and experimental results are discussed, which validate {{the accuracy of the}} models and the effectiveness of the relevant approaches.

The measurement results for number concentration versus time were compared between paired <b>particle</b> <b>monitors</b> of the same type, and to results from the Scanning Mobility Particle Spectrometer (SMPS) which was widely used to measure concentration of size-specific particles.

The mean percent difference increased from 23. 4 % to 212. 0 % (range of 95 % agreement limits: 7. 1 %) with increasing particle concentrations that were above the dynamic upper limit.

Blanco Chair of Supervisory Committee: Professor Richard A. Fenske Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences Pesticide drift from {{agricultural}} spraying is {{a significant}} public health concern, affecting workers and surrounding communities. In Washington State, a majority of pesticide-related illnesses and application-related complaints involve drift. This study employed real-time particle monitors to characterize off-target spray drift during a series of orchard spray trials. The study was nested within a larger study that used micronutrients as tracers, and both active and passive sampling methods. Sections of an orchard block were randomly sprayed by alternating two orchard spray technologies – axial fan airblast (AFA) and multi-head fan tower (MFT) – while ten Dylos DC 1100 Pro real-time particle counters sampled aerosols generated by the sprayers from various locations in a neighboring block, ranging from 0 - 122 meters (0 - 400 ft) downwind. Two meteorological stations collected wind speed, wind direction, temperature and relative humidity throughout the study period. Measurable aerosol drift levels were found at all downwind sampling locations for both sprayers. Significantly greater drift {{was associated with the}} AFA than the MFT sprayer below the canopy and at closer distances. Controlling for wind speed and height, the 75 th drift percentiles were 123. 5 and 43. 3 µg/m 3 for the AFA and MFT sprayers respectively. Independent of sprayer type and wind speed, the 75 th drift percentiles were 29. 3 and 17. 7 µg/m 3 above and below the canopy respectively. In a restricted analysis looking at spray periods and controlling for sprayer type, wind speed and height, every additional foot (0. 305 m) away from the sprayer was associated with 0. 1 µg/m 3 of reduced drift. These results were consistent with results determined by passive sampling methods. Our findings indicate that real-time <b>particle</b> <b>monitoring</b> for pesticide aerosols can serve as an accurate and relatively inexpensive approach to characterizing pesticide drift...|$|E

The effect of treated water particle concentration on distribution water quality was assessed by monitoring particles {{at the beginning and}} end of four pilot distribution systems (PDSs). Flow conditions in this study produced a 75 -h retention time that included three 8 -h overnight stagnation periods. Generally, higher levels of treatment produced water of lower particle concentration, which resulted in lower particle concentrations and particle volume concentrations in the PDSs. Particles entering the PDS were almost all in the 0. 5 - to 2 -µm size fractions.
