We developed a combined physical/psychological exposure variable with six categories: 1) no/low psychological distress (LPD) and absence of <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> difficulties, 2) moderate psychological distress (MPD) only, 3) serious psychological distress (SPD) only, 4) <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> difficulty only, 5) MPD and <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> difficulties, and 6) SPD and <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> difficulties. Selected complex activity limitations include daily living, social and work limitations. ResultsCompared to adults with LPD and absence of <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> difficulties, the results demonstrated a clear and significant gradient of increasing risk of complex activity limitations beginning with MPD only, SPD only, <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> difficulty only, both MPD and <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> difficulties, and SPD and <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> difficulties.

By using longitudinal data from 395 initially high-functioning, community-dwelling older women in Baltimore, Maryland, from the Women’s Health and Aging Study II (from 1994 to 2006), we simultaneously assessed associations of cognition with later <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> and associations of <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> with later cognition. The analysis included measures of global cognition and 2 cognitive domains (executive functioning and memory), as well as 2 measures of <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> (a Short <b>Physical</b> Performance Battery and a 4 -meter test of usual walking speed). We found the strongest bidirectional associations of memory with <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> and less evidence of associations of <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> with executive functioning and global cognition. For a 1 –standard deviation increase in walking speed, subsequent memory increased by 0. 08 standard deviations (95 % confidence interval: (0. 03, 0. 13)). For a 1 –standard deviation increase in memory, sub-sequent walking speed increased by 0. 07 standard deviations (95 % confidence interval: 0. 03, 0. 10).

The present study examined whether anxiety was associated with poorer <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> among heart failure patients and explored coping strategies and social support as possible explanatory mechanisms. Participants included 262 heart failure patients (mean age = 54 years). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, education, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, treatment for depression or anxiety, current smoking status, body mass index (BMI), and history of myocardial infarction were conducted to examine the study hypotheses. Among participants, 24 % reported borderline and 21 % reported severe anxiety symptoms. Results demonstrated a significant association between anxiety and poorer <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> (beta =. 43, p<. 001).

40|$|Research has {{investigated}} testosterone {{and its role}} in biological and psychological functioning. Testosterone levels decrease as men age, and aging has been associated with declines in muscle mass and strength. Decreased functional mobility can impact quality of life. Aging has also been associated with increased vulnerability to depressive symptomatology. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate interrelationships among testosterone, <b>physical</b> <b>functioning,</b> quality of life, and depression in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA). The mean age of the 1, 237 men in VETSA was 55. 4 (+ 2. 5). Testosterone data collection began in the third year of VETSA, yielding an available sample of 778. It was hypothesized that there would be significant associations between testosterone and <b>physical</b> <b>functioning,</b> depression, and quality of life as well as between <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> and depression and quality of life. Contrary to expectations, when mixed models for linear regression were used, testosterone was shown to be related only to <b>physical</b> <b>functioning.</b> As predicted, however, <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> was significantly related to depression and quality of life. Cholesky decompositions were conducted to address the hypothesis that there were shared genetic determinants of each phenotype. Best fitting bivariate models included additive genetic and unique environmental but not common environmental influences. Significant genetic correlations were found between <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> and depression, and <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> and the mental health component score of the Short Form Health Survey (SF- 36). Contrary to expectations, while testosterone and <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> were significantly correlated with each other phenotypically, there was no genetic correlation between the two. Trivariate models revealed genetic influences specific to depression as well as genetic influences shared with quality of life and depression. Finally, path analysis demonstrated that testosterone had a direct impact on <b>physical</b> <b>functioning.</b> <b>Physical</b> <b>functioning,</b> but not testosterone, directly impacted depression and quality of life. As there was no genetic correlation between testosterone and <b>physical</b> <b>functioning,</b> but there was a phenotypic correlation, it may be that other factors, such as cortisol, influenced the association.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: According to the Cognitive {{behavioral}} therapy (CBT) {{protocol for}} patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), therapists are advised to categorize patients in relatively active and passive patients. However, {{evidence to support the}} differences in <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> between these subgroups is limited. Using the baseline data from a multicentre randomized controlled trial (FatiGo), the differences in actual and perceived <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> between active and passive patients with CFS were evaluated. METHODS: Sixty patients, who received CBT during the FatiGo trial were included. Based on the expert opinion and using the definitions of subgroups defined in the CBT protocols, the therapist categorized the patient. Data from an activity monitor was used to calculate actual <b>physical</b> <b>functioning,</b> <b>physical</b> activity, daily uptime, activity fluctuations and duration of rest during daily life. Perceived <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> was assessed by measuring <b>physical</b> activity, <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> and functional impairment with the Checklist Individual Strength, Short Form- 36 and Sickness-Impact Profile 8.

40|$|Objective: A {{prospective}} {{study was conducted}} in order to establish whether AS patients, who are defined as non-responders after 3 months of anti-TNF therapy, show improvement on performance-based tests of <b>physical</b> <b>functioning.</b> Methods: At baseline and 3 months after the start of anti-TNF therapy, AS patients completed seven performance-based tests of <b>physical</b> <b>functioning,</b> questionnaires on self-reported <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> (BASFI) and disease activity (BASDAI), and a pain and a global patient assessment. The concordance between ≥ 20 % intra-individual improvement on the performance-based test of <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> and (i) response to anti-TNF therapy [Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society 20 % (ASAS 20) response] and (ii) ≥ 20 % intra-individual improvement on self-reported <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> (BASFI) was assessed. Results: One hundred AS patients were included, of which 82 patients completed all tests at both time points. After 3 months of anti-TNF therapy, 27 (32. 9 %) patients were categorized as non-responders according to the ASAS 20 response criteria. Improvement in performance-based <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> was seen in 13 of the 27 non-responders (48. 1 %) (i. e. n = 13 / 82 = 15. 9 % of the total group). Furthermore, 30 (36. 6 %) patients showed no improvement on self-reported <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> (BASFI). However, 17 of the 30 (56. 7 %) patients did improve on the performance-based tests of <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> (i. e. n = 17 / 82 = 20. 7 % of the total group). Conclusion: After 3 months of anti-TNF therapy, performance-based tests of <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> showed improvement in 48. 1 % of the ASAS 20 non-responders. With these performance-based tests, new information on outcome after anti-TNF therapy can be generated. Using performance-based tests alongside the BASFI could have additional value in the evaluation of outcomes for patients receiving anti-TNF therapy. © The Author 2013.

The disconnection of the flesh, of <b>physical</b> <b>function</b> in whatever ravaged area, {{that may well be}} measureless; but how interesting, if the futility of such praise doesn't too much dishonour the subject, the exquisite anomaly of the intimate readjustment of the really more inflamed and exasperated part, or in other words of the imagination, the captured, the haunted vision, to life at its most innocent and most ordered!' To that point one's unvarying thought of the matter, which yet, though but a meditation without a conclusion, becomes the very air in which fond attention spends itself. So far as commerce of the acceptable, the tentatively helpful kind goes, one looks for the key to success then, among the victims, exactly on that ground of the apprehension pacified and almost, so to call it, trivialised. The attaching thing becomes thus one's intercourse with the imagination of the particular patient subject, the individual himself, in the measure in which this interest bears us up and carries us along; which name for the life of his spirit has to cover, by a considerable stretch, all the ground. By the stretch of the name, moreover, I am far from meaning any stretch of the faculty itself--which remains for the most part a considerably contracted or inert force, a force in fact often so undeveloped as to be insusceptible of measurement at all, so that one has to resort, in face of the happy fact that communion still does hold good, to some other descriptive sign for it. That sign, however, fortunately presents itself with inordinate promptitude and fits to its innocent head with the last perfection the cap, in fact the very crown, of an office that we can only appraise as predetermined good nature. We after this fashion score our very highest on behalf of a conclusion, I think, in feeling that whether or no the British warrior's good nature has much range of fancy, his imagination, whatever there may be of it, is at least so good-natured as to show absolutely everything it touches, everything without exception, even the worst machinations of the enemy, in that colour. Variety and diversity of exhibition, in a world virtually divided as now into hospitals and the preparation of subjects for them, are, I accordingly conceive, to be looked for quite away from the question of physical patience, of the general consent to suffering and mutilation, and, instead of that, in this connection of the sort of mind and thought, the sort of moral attitude, that are born of the sufferer's other relations; which I like to think of as being different from country to country, from class to class, and as having their fullest national and circumstantial play.|$|E

The MUMC+ aims to develop a screening tool for identifying patients with a high risk for delayed postoperative functional recovery, the high-risk patients, and to introduce personalized preoperative exercise training to these patients at risk to increase the body’s capacity to deal with hospitalization. Aim: To evaluate the feasibility of monitoring <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> during the preoperative course in patients with colorectal cancer who undergo elective surgery. Besides, to explore patients’ preoperative level of <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> and its relation with postoperative outcomes. Methods: A pilot prospective observational cohort design {{was used to evaluate}} the feasibility of measurements to monitor <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> before surgery. Patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer, scheduled for elective surgery in the MUMC+, were included. Measurements were performed shortly after diagnosis (T 0) and at hospital admission (T 1). Feasibility was measured using a questionnaire. <b>Physical</b> <b>functioning</b> was measured in terms of <b>physical</b> fitness, <b>functioning</b> and <b>physical</b> activity. After surgery, postoperative complications, reoperations, length of stay, mortality, and discharge destination were recorded. Results: Ten patients (seven male, mean age 70. 8 ± 8. 8 years) completed the preoperative measurements. All participants think the measurements give a good indication of the preoperative course of <b>physical</b> <b>functioning.</b> The measurement procedure was rated with an 8. 8 ± 1. 0 on a 10 -point scale.

40|$|Objective To {{validate}} Kalache & Kickbusch's model: namely, that functional capacity {{peaks in}} early adulthood, then declines {{at a rate}} dependent on fitness level until a "disability threshold" is reached. Methods Data came from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health, which followed three cohorts from 1996 to 2011 : a young, a mid-aged and an older cohort (born in 1973 - 78, 1946 - 51 and 1921 - 26, respectively). The Short Form (36) Health Survey {{was used to measure}} <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> (score 1 - 100). The disability threshold was the mean <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> score in older women requiring assistance with daily activities (62. 8). The relationship between age and <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> was modelled using spline regression for the entire sample, and by baseline <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> quintile and <b>physical</b> activity level. Findings Physical decline quickened with age: 0. 05 annual units (95 % confidence interval, CI: - 0. 13 to 0. 22) at ages 18 - 23 years (i. e. no decline); - 2. 43 (95 % CI: - 2. 64 to - 2. 23) at ages 82 - 90 years. Decline was faster in quintiles with lower baseline <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> in the younger and mid-age cohorts and in quintiles with higher baseline <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> in the older cohort. The disability threshold was reached at a mean age of 79 years, but the range was 45 - 88 years, depending on baseline <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> and <b>physical</b> activity. Conclusion Age and physical decline are not linearly related, as traditionally believed; decline accelerates with age. However, baseline <b>physical</b> <b>functioning,</b> but not <b>physical</b> activity, influences the rate of decline...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose. Self-report and performance-based {{measures}} of <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> in people {{before and after}} total hip arthroplasty seem to present different information. The relationship between these different measures is not well understood, and little information is available about changes in this relationship over time. The aims of this study were: (1) to determine the relationship between self-report and performance-based {{measures of}} <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> before and after total hip arthroplasty, (2) to assess the influence of pain on the relationship, and (3) {{to determine whether the}} relationship changes over time. Subjects and Methods. Seventy-five subjects admitted for total hip arthro-plasty were included and examined before and 6 and 26 weeks after surgery. The relationships between the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> subscale and walking speed and gait variability were examined by use of generalized estimating equations, which included interac-tions with time and the WOMAC pain subscale. Results. The relationship between self-report and performance-based measures of <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> was poor. Pain appeared to have a considerable influence on self-reported <b>physical</b> <b>functioning.</b> The relationship did not appear to change over time. Discussion and Conclusion. The influence of pain on self-reported <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> serves as an explanation for the poor relationship between self-reported and performance-based <b>physical</b> <b>functioning.</b> When using a self-report measure such as the WOMAC, one should realize that {{it does not seem to}} assess the separate constructs—physical functioning and pain—that are claimed to be measured.

40|$|Background and aims: Aging people show a {{deterioration}} {{in a variety}} of functions. Knowledge about factors that may delay this deterioration is crucial for identifying causal pathways and potential intervention strategies. Physical fitness has been proposed to be such a factor, but longitudinal studies have been scarce. This study determined the influence of <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> on cognitive performance both cross-sectionally and longitudinally over a period of six years in a healthy adult population sample. Methods: Data were used from a longitudinal study involving 703 participants in the 24 - 86 year age range, as part of the Maastricht Aging Study (MAAS). <b>Physical</b> <b>functioning</b> was measured with the SF- 36 health questionnaire. Participants were tested using cognitive tests of verbal memory, executive functioning, reaction time and information processing speed, both at baseline and at a six-year follow-up examination. Results: At baseline, <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> was positively associated with scores on tests of executive functioning. Participants with an increase in <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> were less likely to experience cognitive decline during the six years of follow-up. After correction for age, sex, educational level, baseline <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> and cognitive performance, <b>physical</b> <b>functioning</b> at follow-up was still positively associated with scores on tests for executive functioning (Stroop-interference) and information processing speed (Letter-Digit Substitution Test). The observed effects remained unchanged when six participants who developed a neurodegenerative disorder {{during the course of the}} study were excluded. Conclusion: <b>Physical</b> <b>functioning</b> has a significant positive effect on cognitive performance after six years in normally aging adults...|$|R
