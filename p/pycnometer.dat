50|$|A gas <b>pycnometer</b> is a {{laboratory}} device used {{for measuring the}} density—or, more accurately, the volume—of solids, be they regularly shaped, porous or non-porous, monolithic, powdered, granular or in some way comminuted, employing some method of gas displacement and the volume:pressure relationship known as Boyle's Law. A gas <b>pycnometer</b> is also {{sometimes referred to as}} a helium <b>pycnometer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Variable volume <b>pycnometer</b> (or gas {{comparison}} <b>pycnometer)</b> {{consists of}} either a single or two variable volume chambers. The sample cell volume {{can be at}} different types and size, like G-DenPyc 2900 technology specified, the volume can be 0.1ml up to 500ml. The volume of the chamber(s) can be varied by either a fixed amount by a simple mechanical piston of fixed travel, or continuously and gradually {{by means of a}} graduated piston. Resulting changes in pressure can be read by means of a transducer, or nullified by adjustment of a third ancillary, graduated variable-volume chamber. This type of <b>pycnometer</b> is commercially obsolete; in 2006 ASTM withdrew its standard test method D2856 for the open-cell content of rigid cellular plastics by the air <b>pycnometer,</b> which relied upon the use of a variable volume <b>pycnometer,</b> and was replaced by test method D6226 which describes a gas expansion <b>pycnometer.</b>|$|E

These efforts were scoping in nature, and their results, along with those of other investigations, are being used to develop suitable procedures for determining bulk properties of tuffaceous rock in support of thermal and mechanical properties evaluations. Comparisons were made between various sample preparation, handling, and measurement techniques for both zeolitized and nonzeolitized tuff in order to assess their effects on bulk property determinations. Laboratory tests included extensive drying regimes to evaluate dehydration behavior, the acquisition of data derived from both gas and water <b>pycnometers</b> to compare their suitability in determining grain densities, a comparison of particle size effects, and a set of experiments to evaluate whole core saturation methods. The results affirm the added complexity of these types of measurements where there is a zeolite component in the sample mineralogy.

40|$|Blocking of {{petroleum}} producing pipelines with clathrate hydrates of natural gases {{is a large}} issue in the industry. It causes loss of income in addition with health, safety and environmental concerns. This master thesis considers inhibition and dissociation of clathrate hydrates of natural gases with the thermodynamic inhibitor potassium formate. Potassium formate is a salt frequently used during drilling operations, but the writer has not found information about the usage of the salt as a thermodynamic inhibitor in petroleum production. Its application as a thermodynamic inhibitor is of large interest due to its properties, especially for shut-in wells as the salt is considered very heavy and has a large solubility in water. The distribution of the salts sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium formate (HCOOK) in a two-meter vertical pipe was investigated to simulate a shut-in well or riser. The salt solutions {{were added to the}} top of the distilled water filled pipe. <b>Pycnometers</b> were used to measure the brine densities at different heights in the pipe. Higher densities corresponded with more salt. The hypothesis about the heavy HCOOK salt accumulating at the bottom of the pipe was not confirmed, when it was found that both salts became almost homogeneously dispersed in the pipe after short time for all brine concentrations investigated. It means that the salt would inhibit the whole water phase and not only the lower or upper part, as the conventional hydrate inhibitors in the petroleum industry are known to do. Potassium formate s quick distribution to a homogeneous mix could improve flow assurance in production wells. It is an advantage for producing wells to have a homogeneous salt distribution, because the whole water phase gets protected against hydrates. But it is a disadvantage for hydrate dissociation in the bottom a pipe if the inhibitor should be used to penetrate the water phase and accumulate at the bottom to dissociate hydrates...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} method {{measuring}} {{the density of}} a liquid is with a hydrometer; hydrometers can be calibrated {{with a number of}} scales. A common scale is that of specific gravity (SG); that is to say the density of a liquid relative to the density of pure water (at a standard temperature). Specific gravity can also be measured by a <b>pycnometer</b> or oscillating U-tube electronic meter. Water has a SG of 1.000, absolute alcohol has a SG of 0.789.

The volume measured in a gas <b>pycnometer</b> is that amount of three-dimensional space which is inaccessible to the gas used, i.e. that volume within the sample chamber from which the gas is excluded. Therefore, the volume measured considering the finest scale of surface roughness will depend on the atomic or molecular size of the gas.

50|$|As {{specific}} gravity {{was the basis}} for the Balling, Brix and Plato tables, dissolved sugar content was originally estimated by measurement of {{specific gravity}} using a hydrometer or <b>pycnometer.</b> In modern times, hydrometers are still widely used, but where greater accuracy is required, an electronic oscillating U-tube meter may be employed. Whichever means are used, the analyst enters the tables with specific gravity and takes out (using interpolation if necessary) the sugar content in percent by mass. If the analyst uses the Plato tables (maintained by the American Society of Brewing Chemists) he or she reports in °P. If using the Brix table (the current version of which is maintained by NIST and can be found on their website), he or she reports in °Bx. If using the ICUMSA tables, he or she would report in mass fraction (m.f.). It is not, typically, actually necessary to consult tables as the tabulated °Bx or °P value can be printed directly on the hydrometer scale next to the tabulated value of specific gravity or stored in the memory of the electronic U-tube meter or calculated from polynomial fits to the tabulated data. Both ICUMSA and ASBC have published suitable polynomials; in fact, the ICUMSA tables are calculated from the polynomials. The opposite is true with the ASBC polynomial. Also note that the tables in use today are not those published by Brix or Plato. Those workers measured true specific gravity reference to water at 4 °C using, respectively, 17.5 °C and 20 °C, as the temperature at which the density of a sucrose solution be measured. Both NBS and ASBC converted to apparent specific gravity at 20 °C/20 °C. The ICUMSA tables are based on more recent measurements on sucrose, fructose, glucose and invert sugar, and they tabulate true density and weight in air at 20 °C against mass fraction.|$|E
