30|$|The International Law Clinic team, however, {{highlighted}} {{a number}} of subjective elements we should consider {{in relation to the}} ordering of forced displacement and in establishing who is responsible for ensuring that illegal forced displacement does not take place. The ICC has no case law on forced displacement or on the punishable <b>preparatory</b> <b>act</b> of ordering. Therefore, the investigation team construed its objective and subjective elements in light of criminal justice notions (i) punishable preparatory acts; (ii) ‘ordering’ as mode of individual criminal liability; (iii) effective control and command responsibility; and (iv) indirect perpetration as an organized structure of power. The team also analysed the concept of military necessity under Hague and Geneva Law (Olásolo et al. 2016).|$|R

30|$|The El Rosario International Law Clinic {{found two}} {{established}} positions regarding {{the definition of}} ordering as a criminal act. One position based on the broad intention of AP II (1977) Art. 17 found that; ‘(…) “ordering” should be interpreted as any voluntary action that causes the displacement’ (Willms 2009 p 558 - 559). Consequentially parties are responsible for acts which directly, or indirectly, cause the displacement of the civilian population. The second position based on the drafting process of the RS Article in question maintains that “ordering” is a <b>preparatory</b> <b>act</b> prohibited in itself and that other acts, such as instigating, may not be considered orders. Accordingly, under this position liability would only attach in the issuance of an order, {{regardless of whether the}} order leads to civilian displacement or not (Dörmann 2003 p 431 - 407; Olásolo et al. 2016 p 70 - 71).|$|R

The standard is not a clear bright line standard. The closer the preparatory act is to the completed crime, the stronger the case for calling it an attempt. The determination as to whether the standard has been met is a matter for the jury to determine.|$|E

5000|$|Dispensation rescripts are {{generally}} drawn up in formâ commissâ mixtâ, i. e. they are entrusted to an executor who is thereby obliged {{to proceed to}} their execution, if he finds that the reasons are as alleged (si vera sint exposita). Canonists are divided as to whether rescripts in formâ commissâ mixtâ contain a favour granted {{from the moment of}} their being sent off, or to be granted when the execution actually takes place. Gasparri holds it as received practice that it suffices if the reasons alleged be actually true at the moment when the petition is presented. It is certain, however, that the executor required by Penitentiaria rescripts may safely fulfil his mission even if the pope should die before he had begun to execute it. The executor named for public impediments is usually the ordinary who forwards the supplica and for secret impediments an approved confessor chosen by the petitioner. Except when specially authorized, the person delegated cannot validly execute a dispensation before he has seen the original of the rescript. Therein it is usually prescribed that the reasons given by the petitioners must be verified. This verification, usually no longer a condition for valid execution, can be made, in the case of public impediments, extrajudicially or by subdelegation. In foro interno it can be made by the confessor in the very act of hearing the confessions of the parties. Should the inquiry disclose no substantial error, the executor proclaims the dispensation, i. e. he makes known, usually in writing, especially if he acts in foro externo, the decree which dispenses the petitioners; if the rescript authorizes him, he also legitimizes the children. Although the executor may subdelegate the <b>preparatory</b> <b>acts,</b> he may not, unless the rescript expressly says so, subdelegate the actual execution of the decree, unless he subdelegates to another ordinary. When the impediment is common to, and known to, both parties, execution ought to be made for both; wherefore, in a case in foro interno, the confessor of one of the parties hands over the rescript, after he has executed it, to the confessor of the other. The executor ought to observe with care the clauses enumerated in the decree, as some of them constitute conditions sine quâ non for the validity of the dispensation. As a rule, these clauses affecting validity may be recognized by the conditional conjunction or adverb of exclusion with which they begin (e. g. dummodo, [...] "provided that"; et non aliter, [...] "not otherwise"), or by an ablative absolute. When, however, a clause only prescribes a thing already of obligation by law it has merely the force of a reminder. In this matter also it is well {{to pay attention to the}} stylus curiœ, i. e. the legal diction of the Roman Congregations and Tribunals, and to consult authors of repute.|$|E

40|$|Background: Recent {{analyses}} of antiepileptic drugs have indicated {{an increase in}} the risk of suicidality. The objective of this report was to provide clinical information and an independent meta-analysis of divalproex sodium and suicidality events by analyzing data from 13 placebo-controlled studies and 1 low-dose controlled study. Methods: Adverse events considered to be possibly suicide related were identified using the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) methodology. Indications included epilepsy, bipolar disorder, migraine prophylaxis, impulsive aggression, and dementia. Narratives were produced for every event, and suicidality event ratings were performed by a third party blinded to treatment assignment. Statistical analyses were conducted using methodology similar to that reported by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Results: Suicidality events were identified in 5 of the 13 placebo-controlled studies. Of the 1, 327 (0. 83 %) subjects taking divalproex sodium, 11 had suicidality events: 2 suicide attempts and 9 suicidal ideation. Of 992 (0. 91 %) subjects taking placebo, 9 had suicidality events: 1 <b>preparatory</b> <b>act</b> toward suicide, 2 suicide attempts, and 6 suicidal ideation.

Conclusions In this meta-analysis, divalproex sodium does not appear to increase the risk of suicide-related adverse events relative to placebo in the populations studied. Clinicians should nonetheless remain vigilant in assessing suicidality, not only in patients treated for mental disorders with inherently high suicide risk, but also in patients taking antiepileptic medications. </p...|$|R

40|$|It is {{very hard}} to {{generate}} a set of criteria to separate preparatory from executive acts. This fact can be considered as a necessity. At the same time this also reflects the vulnerability of the legality principle. The distinction between <b>preparatory</b> <b>acts</b> and the executive acts {{is one of the most}} controversial issues in modern criminal law. In Turkish Penal Code, the sole criterion regarding the beginning of executive acts is reflected in Art. 35 which states”A person who (directly) acts”. This in fact is not a clear formulation and unable to answer the question of when exactly the executive acts start. Therefore, the Turkish courts, especially the Supreme Court (Yargıtay), are inspiring from the Turkish doctrine which takes advantages of various theories below, adopts and updates new measures and criteria to separate <b>preparatory</b> <b>acts</b> from executive ones...|$|E

40|$|In England and Wales, Section 15 of the Sexual Offences Act (2003) criminalizes the act {{of meeting}} a child –someone under 16 —after grooming. The {{question}} to be pursued in this paper is whether grooming –I confine myself to online grooming—is justly criminalized. I shall argue that it is. One line of thought will be indirect. I shall first try to rebut a general argument against the criminalization of acts that are preparatory to the commission of serious offences. Grooming is one such act, but there are others, sometimes associated with terrorism. According to me, the general argument misapplies certain considerations about autonomy that are alleged {{to be in force}} in other areas of criminal law. Contrary to that general argument, criminalization of <b>preparatory</b> <b>acts</b> does not, in general, bypass the agency of citizens. Moreover, the criminalization of <b>preparatory</b> <b>acts</b> can disrupt activity that would have led to very serious crime, and with relatively low costs to the perpetrators, costs that reflect the non-occurrence of the more serious crime. There is evidence that grooming is harmful in itself, and so another point against the general argument is its assumption that preparatory offences are often harmless or at least victimless. There are objections to some of the undercover policing techniques that lead to a Section 15 prosecution, but these objections are not all weighty...|$|E
50|$|The World War I system {{served as}} a model for that of World War II. The 1940 STSA instituted {{national}} conscription in peacetime, requiring registration of all men between 21 and 35, with selection for one year's service by a national lottery. The term of service was extended by one year in August 1941. After Pearl Harbor the STSA was further amended (December 19, 1941), extending the term of service to the duration of the war and six months and requiring the registration of all men 18 to 64 years of age. In the massive draft of World War II, 49 million men were registered, 36 million classified , and 10 million inducted.President Roosevelt's signing of the STSA on September 16, 1940, began the first peacetime draft in the United States. It also established the Selective Service System as an independent agency responsible for identifying and inducting young men into military service. Roosevelt named Hershey to head the Selective Service on July 31, 1941, where he remained until 1969. This <b>preparatory</b> <b>act</b> came when other preparations, such as increased training and equipment production, had not yet been approved. Nevertheless, it served {{as the basis for the}} conscription programs that would continue to the present. The act set a cap of 900,000 men to be in training at any given time and limited military service to 12 months. An amendment increased this 18 more months in August 1941. Later legislation on December 20, 1942 amended the act to require all men from 18 to 64 to register, with those aged 20 to 44 being able for induction. 18 and 19 year olds were made liable for induction and the upper age limit for the draft was reduced to 37 beginning on November 13, 1942. Service commitments for inductees were set at the length of the war plus six months. As manpower need increased during World War II, draftees were inducted into the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps.|$|R
