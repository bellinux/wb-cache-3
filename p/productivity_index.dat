40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop exact {{relationships}} between empirical Fisher indexes and their theoretical Malmquist and Konus counterparts.

We next use implicit Konus quantity and <b>productivity</b> <b>indexes</b> to establish exact relationships between Konus price and price recovery indexes and Fisher price and price recovery indexes. We then show that Konus price and price recovery indexes and Fisher quantity and <b>productivity</b> <b>indexes</b> “almost” satisfy the product test with the relevant value change, we derive a price mix function that ensures satisfaction of the product test, and we show that this price mix function differs fundamentally from the quantity mix function relating Malmquist and Fisher indexes...|$|R
