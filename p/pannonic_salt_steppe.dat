40|$|Natura 2000 Habitat Conservation Status is {{currently}} evaluated based on fieldwork. However, this {{is proving to}} be unfeasible over large areas. The use of remote sensing is increasingly encouraged but covering the full range of ecological variables by such datasets and ensuring compatibility with the traditional assessment methodology has not been achieved yet. We aimed to test Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) as a source for mapping all variables required by the local official conservation status assessment scheme and to develop an automated method that calculates Natura 2000 conservation status at 0. 5 m raster resolution for 24 km 2 of <b>Pannonic</b> <b>Salt</b> <b>Steppe</b> habitat (code 1530). We used multi-temporal (summer and winter) ALS point clouds with full-waveform recording and a density of 10 pt/m 2. Some required variables were derived from ALS product rasters; others involved vegetation classification layers calculated by machine learning and fuzzy categorization. Thresholds separating favorable and unfavorable values of each variable required by the national assessment scheme were manually calibrated from 10 plots where field-based assessment was carried out. Rasters representing positive and negative scores for each input variable were integrated in a ruleset that exactly follows the Hungarian Natura 2000 assessment scheme for grasslands. Accuracy of each parameter and the final conservation status score and category was evaluated by 10 independent assessment plots. We conclude that ALS is a suitable data source for Natura 2000 assessments in grasslands, and that the national grassland assessment scheme can successfully be used as a GIS processing model for conservation status, ensuring that the output is directly comparable with traditional field based assessments...|$|E
40|$|Alkali grasslands are {{included}} in the Natura 2000 Habitats Directive as <b>Pannonic</b> <b>salt</b> <b>steppes</b> and <b>salt</b> marshes (1530) priority habitats. They harbour a unique flora and fauna; thus, conservation and restoration of their biodiversity is of a high priority. Technical restoration is often necessary to mitigate the negative landscape-scale effects of agricultural crop production and to increase the area occupied by grasslands. Recovery of grassland vegetation can be facilitated by sowing seeds of target species. Low-diversity seed mixtures provide a cost-effective measure, as they are easily formulated and applied in large-scale grassland restorations. Between 2004 and 2008 a total of 760 ha of former croplands were sown with low diversity seed mixtures of appropriate species to restore basic alkali grasslands in Hortobágy National Park, East-Hungary. The seed mixture contained seeds of Festuca pseudovina and Poa angustifolia. After soil preparation seed mixtures were sown at a rate of 25 kg/ha in October. The sown fields were mown once a year. To follow vegetation changes, two 25 m 2 sampling sites per field were established after sowing. To assess the effect of mowing on the vegetation, one sample site in each field was not mown after the third year. Biomass was sampled in the permanent plots to monitor vegetation changes. The rapidly Recovery of Alkaline Grasslands using Native Seed Mixtures 183 developing perennial cover effectively suppressed short-lived weeds in the aboveground vegetation, but allowed the preservation of their soil seed banks. We found that the high levels of biomass production typical of alkali grassland restorations in former croplands are beneficial for the suppression of short-lived weedy forbs, but might hamper the immigration of characteristic alkali grassland species. We stress that a long-term post-restoration management program is essential for sustaining recovered grassland biodiversity. This could be accomplished by mowing in the first few years, and later by extensive grazing by cattle and sheep. The latter management practice also supports the establishment of characteristic alkali grassland species...|$|R

50|$|The Euro-Siberian {{area is a}} mountainous {{ecoregion}} lying within western Turkey. Here {{the flora}} transitions from the Mediterranean vegetation type to the Anatolian plateau. The dominant vegetation cover here is forests of oak and pine, especially Anatolian black pine and Turkish pine. Further east is the Anatolian plateau, a largely treeless area of plains and river basins at an average altitude of 1000 m. This area is characterised by hot dry summers and cold winters. <b>Salt</b> <b>steppes</b> and lakes are found here, as well salt-free grassland areas, marshes and freshwater systems. Immediately around the large Lake Tuz and other saline areas, saltmarsh plants grow, and beyond this is a sharp divide, with the flora being dominated {{by members of the}} families Chenopodiaceae and Plumbaginaceae.|$|R
50|$|Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries {{is listed}} as a Special Area of Conservation by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, a public body that advises the Welsh Government on {{international}} nature conservation. The area conserved includes sea inlets, tidal rivers, estuaries, mud flats, sand flats, lagoons (including saltwork basins), salt marshes, <b>salt</b> pastures, <b>salt</b> <b>steppes,</b> shingle, sea cliffs and islets. The sand and mud flats have large numbers of bivalve molluscs including the edible cockle. The large shallow inlets and bays provide habitat for {{a great variety of}} marine invertebrates. The saltmarshes have biodiverse communities of glasswort (Salicornis species), dwarf eelgrass (Zostera noltei), sea rush (Juncus maritimus) and marsh-mallow (Althaea officinalis) and all the wildlife they support. A primary reason for the listing is the presence in the bay of the twait shad (Alosa fallax), a migratory fish.|$|R

This study reports the effects of salinity (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 g l- 1 CaCl 2) on the growth, succulence, proline and ion content of the species under in vitro conditions. Fresh and dry weight of plants increased {{with an increase in}} salinity. Optimal growth was recorded at 8 g l- 1 CaCl 2; growth declined with increased levels of salinity. Ca 2 +, K+, Cl–, and proline contents in plants increased, whereas Na+ content decreased with an increase in salinity. Succulence of shoots and roots was significantly higher at CaCl 2 concentrations of 12 to 20 g l- 1 than at 8 g l- 1 CaCl 2. Water potential of plants decreased with an increase in salinity.

40|$|Symphyotrichum ciliatum was {{reported}} as invasive in Romania {{in the early}} 1970 s. In this study we have analysed its invasion history, current distribution in Romania, habitat preferences and the associated plant communities. Data recorded during our recent field work, {{as well as from}} herbaria and previously published papers, were used in the analysis. This data confirms its invasive character. Given the abrupt increase in the slope of the invasion curve during the last decade, we can assume that S. ciliatum is still far from reaching the saturation phase of its invasion in Romania. Habitats invaded by this species are mostly anthropogenic herb stands associated with rail and road transport networks, and the continental inland <b>salt</b> <b>steppes.</b> The classical methodology of the Zürich- Montpellier school was used for the field phytosociological research and the classification of the investigated communities was done using the deductive method. The phytocoenoses dominated by S. ciliatum were classified as derivate communities.

40|$|<b>Salt</b> <b>steppes</b> and marshes {{represent}} {{the most valuable}} ecosystems in the world, providing numerous ecosystem services that are extremely vulnerable to anthropogenic influences. These types of habitat in the territory of Serbia are most dominant in Banat and {{a significant portion of}} them is under protection or in the process of becoming protected. The section surrounding the protected areas of Slano Kopovo Special Nature Reserve, Rusanda Nature Park and Okanj Bara Special Nature Reserve with the non-building area of Novi Bečej, Kumane, Melenci, Elemir and Taraš cadastral municipalities, has been chosen for the analysis. The aim of this paper was to assess the influence of specific anthropogenic factors on the elements of an ecological network using the analytical method that can generate the required results in a manner suitable for presentation to various stakeholders. To achieve this aim, the Leopold matrix model, used for assessing anthropogenic influence on the environment, has been chosen. The specificity of this issue of protecting and preserving elements of an ecological network resulted in the need to isolate and evaluate the factors affecting the preservation of habitats and functionality of ecosystems, unlike the concept of Leopold matrix, which treats all factors as equally important in the process of evaluation. Evaluation results indicate significant effects of historical, perennial manner of using the area and other resources in the non-building area...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the global}} land use and climate change, endangerment of natural {{vegetation}} is in-creasing. That is why the threatening factors were documented in details during the MÉTA mapping. We have documented the impacts of water management, land use (management of woodlands and grasslands), the invasive species, urbanisation, habitat fragmentation and the neighbourhood, as well. In the present article (1) we evaluate the actual state of the habitats by the 28 threat types documented during the MÉTA mapping; (2) we introduce 12 newly developed indicators, which were applied for the semi-quantitative comparison of the overall degree of endangerment of the Hungarian habitats. Based on the summarisation of our results the most seriously endangered habitats in Hungary are as follows: sand and loess steppe oak woodlands (M 2, M 4, L 2 x), tussock sedge communities (B 4), extensive orchards (P 7), closed lowland oak woodlands (L 5, L 6), wa-ter-fringing and fen tall herb communities (D 5), wooded pastures (P 45), vegetation of loess cliffs (I 2), rich fens and Molinia meadows (D 1, D 2), Cynosurion grasslands and Nardus swards (E 34), swamp woodlands (J 2), xero-mesophilous grasslands (H 4) and <b>salt</b> <b>steppe</b> oak woodlands (M 3). The least endangered types are the rocky habitats (I 4, LY 3, H 1, G 2, M 7), certain halophytic (F 1 a, F 5, F 1 b, F 2, B 6) and aquatic habitats (A 23, A 3 a, A 1), open acidophilous woodlands (L 4 b), dry shrub vegetation with Crataegus and Prunus spinosa (P 2 b) and the beech woodlands (K 5).

40|$|Abstract Background Landscape ethnoecology {{focuses on}} the {{ecological}} features of the landscape, how the landscape is perceived, and used by {{people who live in}} it. Though studying folk classifications of species has a long history, the comparative study of habitat classifications is just beginning. I studied the habitat classification of herders in a Hungarian steppe, and compared it to classifications of botanists and laymen. Methods For a quantitative analysis the picture sort method was used. Twenty-three pictures of 7 - 11 habitat types were sorted by 25 herders. ’Density’ of pictures along the habitat gradient of the Hortobágy <b>salt</b> <b>steppe</b> was set as equal as possible, but pictures differed in their dominant species, wetness, season, etc. Before sorts, herders were asked to describe pictures to assure proper recognition of habitats. Results Herders classified the images into three main groups: (1) fertile habitats at the higher parts of the habitat gradient (partos, lit. on the shore); (2) saline habitats (szík, lit. salt or saline place), and (3) meadows and marshes (lapos, lit. flooded) {{at the lower end of}} the habitat gradient. Sharpness of delimitation changed along the gradient. Saline habitats were the most isolated from the rest. Botanists identified 6 groups. Laymen grouped habitats in a less coherent way. As opposed to my expectations, botanical classification was not more structured than that done by herders. I expected and found high correspondence between the classifications by herders, botanists and laymen. All tended to recognize similar main groups: wetlands, ”good grass” and dry/saline habitats. Two main factors could have been responsible for similar classifications: salient features correlated (e. g. salinity recognizable by herders and botanists but not by laymen correlated with the density of grasslands or height of vegetation recognizable also for laymen), or the same salient features were used as a basis for sorting (wetness, and abiotic stress). Conclusions Despite all the difficulties of studying habitat classifications (more implicit, more variable knowledge than knowledge on species), conducting landscape ethnoecological research will inevitably reveal a deeper human understanding of biological organization at a supraspecific level, where natural discontinuities are less sharp than at the species or population level. </p...|$|R
50|$|Mongolia is high, cold, and dry. It has {{an extreme}} {{continental}} climate with long, cold winters and short summers, during which most precipitation falls. The country averages 257 cloudless days a year, {{and it is}} usually {{at the center of}} a region of high atmospheric pressure. Precipitation is highest in the north, which averages 200 to 350 mm per year, and lowest in the south, which receives 100 to 200 mm. The extreme south is the Gobi Desert, some regions of which receive no precipitation at all in most years. The name Gobi is a Mongol word meaning desert, depression, <b>salt</b> marsh, or <b>steppe,</b> but which usually refers to a category of arid rangeland with insufficient vegetation to support marmots but with enough to support camels. Mongols distinguish Gobi from desert proper, although the distinction is not always apparent to outsiders unfamiliar with the Mongolian landscape. Gobi rangelands are fragile and are easily destroyed by overgrazing, which results in expansion of the true desert, a stony waste where not even Bactrian camels can survive.|$|R
40|$|Rising {{atmospheric}} CO 2 {{has resulted}} in declining tissue nutrient concentrations and leaf biochemicals, which has potential ramifications for animal nutrition, herbivory and litter decomposition rates. We investigated the interacting effects of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations (270, 320, 370, and 420 ppmv), plant age (42, 57, 75, and 87 days), and elevation ecotype (<b>salt</b> desert, sagebrush <b>steppe,</b> and mountain brush) on aboveground tissue nutrient levels and biochemistry of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), an important range grass in the Great Basin. Most nutrients were affected by significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) interactions between CO 2 level and plant age, and plant ecotype and plant age. At 87 days growth, tissue C:N ratios increased significantly and concentrations of P, K, and Mg declined, with rising CO 2 levels suggesting declining forage nutrition. Tissue concentrations of Mn, K, Mg, and Ca increased with plant age and, in general, the low elevation ecotype had greater tissue nutrient concentrations than the high elevation ecotype. Hemicellulose concentration was influenced by a significant CO 2 level by ecotype interaction; overall, the high elevation ecotype had greater concentrations of hemicellulose, which increased with increasing CO 2 levels. The high elevation ecotype had significantly less acid detergent fiber than the low or mid elevation ecotypes. These data suggest that increasing atmospheric CO 2 levels may {{have a profound effect}} on the nutritional value of cheatgrass forage, and this effect may differ among elevational ecotypes...|$|R
