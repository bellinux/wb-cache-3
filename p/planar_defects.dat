40|$|Diamonds are {{supposed}} to be formed in the diamond window under high-pressure conditions due to the polymorph graphite/diamond phase transition. In this study we present for the first time, that natural diamonds can be formed by C:O:H bearing volatiles during the uplift of the kimberlitic melt in eclogites from the Roberts Victor mine, South Africa. Our results give evidence that the kimberlitic melt acts like a catalyst, and therefore the C:O:H ratio in the kimberlite changes through the uplift of the kimberlite permanently, caused by the formation of hydrous and carbonatitic minerals within the kimberlitic melt. This catalytic process leads to the growth of light carbon bearing molecules and under favorable thermodynamic, stoichiometric and kinetic conditions micro diamonds can be formed, even under lower pressure conditions outside of the diamond window. High-spatial-resolution synchrotron based FT-IR has been used to detect C:O:H-bearing volatiles around <b>planar</b> <b>defect</b> structures in garnet.

30|$|The {{ratio of}} {{triangle}} and hexagon {{depends on the}} stacking faults commonly occurred in close-packed lattices. For the face-centered cubic metal, when a single <b>planar</b> <b>defect</b> (e.g., a twin or a stacking fault) is involved, hexagonal plates can form in the early stage of growth due to the six-fold symmetry of a face-centered cubic lattice. As proposed by previous reports, {{the presence of a}} <b>planar</b> <b>defect</b> can cause the six-sided faces, where the defect plane ends, to form alternating concave- and convex-type surfaces [20]. Because each atomic site only has three nearest atomic neighbors on the convex-type surface, the stabilization energy for attaching atoms to this surface is relatively low. As a result, the atoms on this surface tend to be dissolved into solution again, creating a high-energy barrier for the addition of atoms. In contrast, the concave-type surface creates a reentrant groove, a self-perpetuating ledge that increases the number of nearest neighbors for an adatom and thus the stabilization energy. In this case, atomic addition becomes favorable. Taken together, in a crystal with a single <b>planar</b> <b>defect,</b> the fast addition of metal to the concave sides can cause those very faces to grow out of existence, leading to a triangular plate whose side faces are bounded by three convex sides that do not favor atomic addition.|$|R
50|$|At the coercive field, {{the vector}} {{component}} of the magnetization of a ferromagnet measured along the applied field direction is zero. There are two primary modes of magnetization reversal: single-domain rotation and domain wall motion. When the magnetization of a material reverses by rotation, the magnetization component along the applied field is zero because the vector points in a direction orthogonal to the applied field. When the magnetization reverses by domain wall motion, the net magnetization is small in every vector direction because the moments of all the individual domains sum to zero. Magnetization curves dominated by rotation and magnetocrystalline anisotropy are found in relatively perfect magnetic materials used in fundamental research. Domain wall motion is a more important reversal mechanism in real engineering materials since defects like grain boundaries and impurities serve as nucleation sites for reversed-magnetization domains. The role of domain walls in determining coercivity is complicated since defects may pin domain walls in addition to nucleating them. The dynamics of domain walls in ferromagnets {{is similar to that}} of grain boundaries and plasticity in metallurgy since both domain walls and grain boundaries are <b>planar</b> <b>defects.</b>|$|E

30|$|In this work, more {{extensive}} TEM examination and model simulation {{were performed to}} gain {{a deeper understanding of}} the nature of <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> in the aforementioned boron carbide nanowires to answer two questions. (1) Do planar defect-free boron carbide nanowires really exist? Literature review shows that due to its relatively low stacking fault energy (75  mJ/m 2) [26], <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> have been frequently observed in bulk boron carbides independent of the synthesis methods [27 – 30]. It has also been reported that the density of <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> decreases as the synthesis temperature increases [30]. However, the <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> were still detectable by TEM from bulk samples synthesized at 2, 100 °C [30]. Considering the common existence of <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> in bulk boron carbides and the relatively low temperatures researchers used to synthesize boron carbide 1 D nanostructures, one may naturally ask ‘Can boron carbide nanowires synthesized at approximately 1, 100 °C be planar defect-free? Or defects always exist but sometimes are not found by TEM?’ (2) If <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> exist in all of our as-synthesized boron carbide nanowires, can their orientations be determined from TEM results showing no characteristic features (i.e., results from the off-zone directions as discussed later)? It is expected that different orientations of <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> could have distinctive effects on the properties of these nanowires, similar to that physical properties of superlattices could be very different along their in-plane and cross-plane directions [31, 32]. Therefore, it is important to know the fault orientation of each boron carbide nanowire when establishing the structure–property relations.|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} in the ‘Background’ section, although in our previous study, approximately 25 % of boron carbide nanowires appear to be planar defect-free based on {{the full range of}} tilting examination, we are wondering whether these nanowires are really without any <b>planar</b> <b>defects.</b> Recently, using the reposition-reexamination process described in the ‘Methods’ section, we clarified this issue. Figure  1 e is a low magnification TEM image of a boron carbide nanowire. An initial full range of tilting examination suggests that the nanowire is planar defect-free, as shown in Figure  1 f. However, after repositioning the nanowire (Figure  1 g) and reexamination, the ‘hidden’ <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> are revealed in Figure  1 h and the nanowire is identified as an AF nanowire. This example further demonstrates that the existence of <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> cannot be fully revealed by observation from one single zone axis. Moreover, in specific occasions, even after a full range of tilting examination limited by the configuration of a microscope, there is still a possibility of neglecting the existence of <b>planar</b> <b>defects.</b> In our current study, twenty five planar defect-free-like nanowires were subjected to multiple rounds of reposition and reexamination, and <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> were seen from all of them eventually. This new finding strongly suggests that <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> exist in all of our as-synthesized boron carbide nanowires.

30|$|In summary, a {{thorough}} {{discussion on the}} observation of <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> in boron carbide nanowires is presented. There are two major findings. (1) <b>Planar</b> <b>defects</b> can easily become invisible during TEM examination, in which case, observation along different zone axes is a must when studying the nature of <b>planar</b> <b>defects.</b> A roadmap based on simulated diffraction patterns along several low index zone axes parallel to <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> is constructed to facilitate the practical TEM examination. (2) An approach has been developed to determine the fault orientation (i.e., transverse faults or axial faults) within a nanowire even if the <b>planar</b> <b>defects</b> are not revealed by TEM, which could facilitate further examination of the nanowire and help to establish the structure–property relations. Although our discussion is focused on boron carbide nanowires, the above two major findings are useful when studying other 1 D nanostructures.

40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} micromagnetic {{model is}} used to calculate the thermal dependence of microcoercivity (hc) produced by the unpinning of a domain wall (DW) from various types of defects in magnetite. Equilibrium solutions are found that minimize the magnetoelastic, anisotropy, exchange, magnetostatic, and external field energies with respect to the wall width (w) and position of the wall relative to the defect. The defect may be a single dislocation, dislocation dipole, <b>planar</b> <b>defect,</b> or <b>planar</b> <b>defect</b> bounded by two parallel dislocations. Wall pinning is produced by (1) microstress fields of dislocations, (2) local changes in exchange and anisotropy constants within a <b>planar</b> <b>defect</b> region, or (3) a combination of both effects. The calculations, using temperature-dependent parameters, predict the thermal dependence of hc (T) as a function of grain size, domain wall width, defect spacing, and type of defect. Results show that, for grain sizes between 1 and 100 μm, hc(T) is usually a function of the wall width raised to some power n. The particular value of n is found to be a function of the DW-defect interaction spacing (d/w), type of defect, and grain size. Also, within this size range, the wall width expands with temperature more gradually than classical theory predicts. The microcoercivity results are used with the theory of Xu and Merrill (1990) to predict the thermal dependence of the macroscopic coercivity Hc in magnetite. For grains with low defect densities, such as recrystallized magnetites, negative dislocation dipoles with d/w≈ 0. 1 – 1 produce a thermal dependence of coercivity that agrees with experimental results. In the high defect density limit, a population of positive and negative dislocation dipoles with a distribution of dipole widths produce an Hc (T) dependence consistent with experimental data from crushed and glass ceramic magnetites.
