40|$|Bitumen {{type and}} content {{are two of}} the {{variables}} that most influence on the cracking resistance of an asphalt mixture, since both determine a more or less ductile fracture. Furthermore, this cracking resistance will be different depending on the temperature at which the mixture is exposed and is especially critical at low temperatures. The effect of bitumen type and content on the cracking resistance and fracture energy of an asphalt concrete mixture is analysed in this paper, by means of a new direct tensile test, Fénix test. With the aim of covering a wide range of performances, three different bitumens were used: a conventional 50 / 70 <b>penetration</b> <b>bitumen,</b> considered as the reference binder; a crumb rubber modified bitumen, which gives flexibility of the mixture; and a low <b>penetration</b> <b>bitumen,</b> which provides more stiffness to the mixture.

40|$|The use of {{conventional}} emulsions for tack coats can cause problems as they frequently {{stick to the}} tires of construction vehicles.

40|$|Asphalt is the binder in asphalt-concrete mixture {{for road}} pavement. Given the asphalt is a {{visco-elastic}} material, {{so that its}} condition is strongly influenced by temperature and the existing traffic load, {{there is no doubt}} that during its service the asphalt-concrete pavement often suffers from various damage, such as being brittle, chipped (cracks), and bleeding. There are a number of ways to improve the performance and durability of asphalt, one of them is using additive material to modify the physical properties of asphalt. Additive materials commonly used, such as arbocel, cellulose fibres or roadcel are all imported material. Their prices are very expensive, so overall they are not economical. Therefore, it is necessary to find a local material that could be used to replace them. This research attempts to use vehicle scrapped tire rubber and plastic mineral water bottles instead of imported additive material, while both of them are environmental-concerned due to their disposal. The study was conducted on the type of Asphalt ConcreteWearing Course(AC-WC) using <b>penetration</b> <b>bitumen</b> 60 / 70.

40|$|Despite {{applications}} of foamed bitumen technology in pavement construction in various {{places around the}} world, there are still several aspects about this technology that are not clear. In addition, knowledge on foamed bitumen technology is mainly empirical and lacks scientific basis. This study addresses some of the aspects for foamed bitumen technology such as: Investigation of any effects in binder composition during the production process for foamed bitumen; assessment {{of the effect of}} bitumen source on foamed bitumen characteristics; development of a rational method to optimise foamed bitumen characteristics and conditions; evaluation of aggregate particle coating within foamed bitumen mixes; further improvements in the mix design procedure specifically the method of compaction and optimum bitumen content determination stages are suggested.  Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques were used to investigate any changes in bitumen composition after the production process of foamed bitumen. Fourier transform infrared tests were done on foamed bitumen and neat bitumen specimens for two bitumens with similar penetration grades. Foamed bitumen characteristics of three bitumens were established by producing foamed bitumen at temperatures of 150 ºC up to 180 ºC and foamant water contents of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 %. From the analysis of variation of foamed bitumen characteristics (maximum expansion ratio and half-life) at different temperatures a new method based on the equi-viscous bitumen temperature to optimize foamed bitumen conditions and characteristics was proposed. Rice density and surface energy concepts were used to evaluate aggregate particle coating with foamed bitumen. A granite aggregate divided into three different size fractions and three sets of foamed bitumen produced from three bitumen penetration grades were used. A gyratory laboratory compaction procedure for laterite gravels treated with foamed bitumen was established using the modified locking concept. Three laterite gravels with different chemical composition were mixed with foamed bitumen produced from one <b>penetration</b> <b>bitumen</b> grade. The resulting mixes were compacted up to 200 gyrations and the corresponding compaction curve defined in terms of height versus number of gyrations noted. In addition, the optimum moisture content requirements at the modified locking point were determined. 3 D packing theory concepts, primary aggregate structure porosity and an indirect tensile strength criteria were employed to determine optimum bitumen content for foamed bitumen mixes.   Fourier infrared techniques revealed that foaming did not cause any changes in the bitumen chemistry, implying that the foamed bitumen production process may possibly be a physical process. Characterisation of foamed bitumen produced from three bitumen penetration grades showed that foamed bitumen characteristics (maximum expansion ratio and half-life) were mainly influenced by binder viscosity rather than the source. The equi-viscous temperature seemed to provide a suitable criterion at which foamed bitumen with optimum characteristics could be produced. Rice density results showed that aggregate size fraction, binder expansion ratio and viscosity influenced aggregate particle coating. For the coarser aggregate fraction, results revealed that binder coating seemed to be mainly influenced by temperature. Whilst for fine aggregate fraction the coating was mainly influenced by surface area. Surface energy results revealed that foamed bitumen exhibited better coating attributes than neat bitumen. A new laboratory compaction procedure for laterite gravels treated with foamed bitumen based on the modified locking point was developed. The modified locking point represents the state at which maximum aggregate particle interlock occurs when mixes are compacted in the field. It is based on the iii analysis of the rate of change for the gyratory compaction curve. The compaction curve in this case is defined in terms of compaction height versus number of gyrations. Gradation analysis beyond the modified locking point showed that aggregate particle breakdown occurred. Analysis of the optimum moisture at the modified locking point revealed that the moisture conditions were less than the aggregate optimum moisture conditions. It is recommended that this point be used to determine the optimal compaction characteristics of foamed bitumen mixes.  Aggregate structure porosity and an indirect tensile strength criteria can be used to determine the bitumen content {{that could be used in}} design of foamed bitumen mixes. This would reduce the amount of resources required since the bitumen content could be estimated prior to carrying out the actual laboratory work given that the aggregate grading is known. The aggregate structure can be divided (based on 3 D packing theory) into oversize, primary, and secondary structures. The primary structure is mostly responsible for carrying loads whilst the secondary structure fills the voids within the primary structure and provides support to the primary structure. The aggregate size particles constituting the primary structure are deduced as a function of standard sieve sizes using the packing theory concepts. The minimum sieve size for the primary structure is proposed as 1 mm. The oversize structure consists of aggregate particles whose size is greater than the maximum size for the primary structure. The secondary structure consists of aggregate particles whose size is below the minimum size for the primary structure. The primary aggregate structure porosity can be used to establish the starting bitumen content; the bitumen content at which this porosity is 50 % is chosen as the initial bitumen content. Indirect tensile strength values corresponding to 50 % primary porosity are determined as well as the bitumen contents and compared against the recommended minimum values. QC 20161012 </p...|$|E

40|$|Storage {{stability}} {{is a very}} important parameter that has to be considered in the formulation of asphalt emulsions. When monomodal emulsions are formulated, Stokes' law is fulfilled, therefore the higher the viscosity the less sedimentation, or the lower average droplet size the less sedimentation. But when bimodal emulsions are formulated, this rule does not apply. In this paper, two types of different emulsions are formulated: monomodal emulsions and bimodal emulsions. Bimodal emulsions are a combination of one large bitumen size and a small one. For this study, hard <b>penetration</b> <b>bitumens</b> were used, B 35 / 50 and B 15 / 25, because they are the most difficult bitumen to emulsify and, consequently, the worst sedimentation values are expected. Once the emulsions are manufactured, they are diluted to a bitumen rate concentration of 60 % and 70 %. Results show that bimodal emulsions, although having lower viscosity than their monomodal counterparts, have higher storage stability.

The binder is an important constituent of an asphalt mix and it affects the overall performance of the mix, especially with regards to permanent deformation and fatigue cracking. The stiffest binder available from the Chevron refinery in the Western Cape is a 70 / 100 <b>penetration</b> grade <b>bitumen.</b> This has resulted in numerous role players in the industry developing experimental binders (closer in stiffness to a 50 / 70 penetration grade binder) to provide an improved performance with regards to asphalt applications. This paper presents the evaluation of an experimental binder in terms of comparisons with 50 / 70 <b>penetration</b> grade <b>bitumen</b> of known good performance. Comparative testing was done using the current South African bitumen specification as well as performance grade properties with reference to AASHTO MP 19 / M 320 and the complex shear moduli. Furthermore, the comparative performance of the binders in identical asphalt mixes containing the same aggregate, grading and binder content were evaluated. The asphalt performance-related tests conducted on the mixes included repeated axial load permanent deformation (rutting indicator), beam fatigue (cracking indicator), dynamic modulus (stiffness indicator) and modified Lottman (durability indicator). The test results were evaluated comparatively to establish whether {{the performance of the}} asphalt mixes differed. The close correlations between some binder tests and the asphalt tests in predicting performance were found to be of interest.

The results show that the magnitude of the average tangent of the dielectric loss angle (average loss tangent) depends on bitumen type. The average loss tangent in the frequency range 0. 01 – 1 Hz is introduced as a potential indicator for predicting polarizability and, thereby, adhesion potential of bitumen binders to quartz aggregates when using Portland cement. In order to obtain acceptable adhesion of 70 / 100 <b>penetration</b> grade <b>bitumen</b> binders and quartz aggregates when using Portland cement, it is suggested that the binder have an average tan δ > 0. 035 in the frequency range 0. 01 – 1 Hz...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 20 th Annual South African Transport Conference 16 - 20 July 2001 "Meeting the transport challenges in Southern Africa", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Polymer modified bitumen (PMB) is used extensively in thin asphalt surfacings and seals. PMB has to be characterised differently from <b>penetration</b> grade <b>bitumen</b> and the improved performance properties are difficult to demonstrate with conventional empirical rheological tests. This paper gives an overview of a test programme that was followed to characterise bitumen-rubber and SBS modified bitumen using conventional as well as non-conventional methods. The effect that filler addition has on binder properties was also investigated. The characterisation was done through fundamental rheological tests. This paper focuses on the testing that was done using {{a state of the}} art dynamic shear rheometer at Natref ’s laboratory in Sasolburg. In this study three binders were compared: • 60 / 70 <b>penetration</b> grade <b>bitumen</b> •SBS modified 60 / 70 bitumen •Bitumen-Rubber A mineral filler prevalent to the Western Cape was used with the binders in binder/filler mixes. The binder/filler ratio in all cases was 50 / 50 by %volume. The dynamic shear rheometer was used to perform frequency sweeps on the binders and binder/filler systems in the temperature range of 5 °C to 75 °C. The results of the frequency sweeps were used to construct Master Curves and Black Diagrams. From the two types of curves, the influence of both rubber addition and filler addition was determined. The high temperature behaviour of the binders was also studied. The conclusions that could be drawn {{based on the results of}} this study include: - Bitumen-Rubber and SBS binders show very different behaviour compared to the 60 / 70 bitumen in the Black Diagram: from the Black Diagram it is clear that PMB has better performance, especially when high temperatures/low frequencies are considered. - The high temperature behaviour of SBS modified binders differs from normal penetration grade bitumen: the SBS exhibits shear thinning behaviour while the 60 / 70 exhibits normal Newtonian behaviour. Thus, the shear rate during mixing and compaction is very important when PMB is used. This paper was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{particularly}} concentrated on identifying {{the causes of}} road deterioration, road defects and determining the most important parameters {{which could be used}} to predict the rate of deterioration particularly in <b>Bitumen</b> <b>penetration</b> macadam roads. A comprehensive literature review was conducted with literature related to both local an international context to determine the road deterioration factors, road defects, rate of deterioration [...] . etc both locally and foreign countries. Moreover, the literature review was accompanied with the road condition surveys where sophisticated equipments were used in developed countries while manual data collection methods were used in developing countries like ours. In achieving the above objectives, a suitable surface condition survey form was developed. Surface condition survey form was accompanied with road surface information, road geometry, sand sealing history and road deformations. Traffic data and sand sealing history were obtained from Provincial Road Development Authority (PRDA) and the rest was obtained by field observations. Data collection was carried out in selected <b>Bitumen</b> <b>penetration</b> macadam roads for about nine months. Cracks, potholes, edge defects, depressions, corrugations are the significant road defects observed in the field. Traffic, age, road geometry, weather, drainage, construction quality as well construction material, maintenance policy play the major role as road deteriorate agents. Potholes and cracks were mainly considered in the field observations of road deformations. The data was analysed by usingthe statistical softwares SPSS and SAS. Category data was used for data analysis and statistical tests were carried out to check the significance of the road deterioration agents. It was found that both potholes and cracks were having significant relationship with age as well as traffic...|$|R

The main objective of the experiments was to evaluate and improve {{the properties of the}} cold mixtures. The mixture properties evaluated were: volumetric properties, indirect tensile stiffness modulus (ITSM), repeated load axial creep and fatigue. These properties were compared with conventional hot asphalt mixtures not containing any waste/recycled materials. To optimise the performances of the mixtures, a target of ITSM value of 2000 MPa was selected. At full curing conditions, the stiffness of the cold mixes was found to be very similar to that of hot mixtures of the same <b>penetration</b> grade base <b>bitumen</b> (100 pen).

40|$|SMA (stone matrix asphalt or stone mastic asphalt) was {{originally}} developed in European and German countries as impervious or highly durable wearing surface for bridge decks. But today, it is pavement surface of choice. Generally {{it consists of}} two parts, a coarse aggregate and a binder rich mortar. It is made by a mixture of crushed coarse and fine aggregates, stabilizer such as fibres or polymers, mineral filler, cement. In present research work, an attempt {{has been made to}} study the properties of SMA mixes with cellulose fibre and using recycled pavement material as well as slag in partial replacement of stone aggregates as coarse and fine aggregate grades. This research project was done to check the usage of recycled pavement material in SMA mixture by conducting Marshall test in the laboratory in which stability value and flow values was examined along with other properties of mixtures.
