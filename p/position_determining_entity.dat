50|$|Regarding the {{relation}} of hermeneutics with problems of analytic philosophy, there has been, particularly among analytic Heideggerians and those working on Heideggerâ€™s philosophy of science, an attempt to try and situate Heidegger's hermeneutic project in debates concerning realism and anti-realism: arguments have been presented both for Heidegger's hermeneutic idealism (the thesis that meaning determines reference or, equivalently, that {{our understanding of the}} being of <b>entities</b> is what <b>determines</b> <b>entities</b> as entities) and for Heidegger's hermeneutic realism (the thesis that (a) there is a nature in itself and science can give us an explanation of how that nature works, and (b) that (a) is compatible with the ontological implications of our everyday practices).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the last}} years, various tools for {{automatic}} semantic annotation of textual information have emerged. The main challenge of all approaches is to solve ambiguity of natural language and assign unique semantic entities {{according to the}} present context. To compare the different approaches a ground truth namely an annotated benchmark is essential. But, besides the actual disambiguation approach the achieved evaluation results are also dependent {{on the characteristics of}} the benchmark dataset and the expressiveness of the dictionary applied to <b>determine</b> <b>entity</b> candidates. This paper presents statistical analyses and mapping experiments on different benchmarks and dictionaries to identify characteristics and structure of the respective datasets...|$|R
