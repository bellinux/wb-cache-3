This paper intends to tackle the impractical time-invariant assumptions which underlie the methods currently used to develop short-term <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> predictors: i) the characteristics of current data captured by on-road sensors are assumed to be time-invariant with respect to those of the historical data, which is used to developed short-term <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> predictors; and ii) the configuration of the on-road sensor systems is assumed to be time-invariant. In fact, both assumptions are impractical in the real world, as the current <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> characteristics can be very different from the historical ones, and also the on-road sensor systems are time-varying in nature due to damaged sensors or component wear. Therefore, misleading forecasting results are likely to be produced when short-term <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> predictors are designed using these two time-invariant assumptions. To tackle these time-invariant assumptions, an intelligent particle swarm optimization algorithm, namely IPSO, is proposed to develop short-term <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> predictors by integrating the mechanisms of particle swarm optimization, neural network and fuzzy inference system, in order to adapt to the time-varying <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> characteristics and the time-varying configurations of the on-road sensor systems.
