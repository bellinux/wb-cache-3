This paper has implemented a method to recover the <b>pulse</b> <b>profiles</b> and the PPA curves of five pulsars which have obvious scattered <b>pulse</b> <b>profiles</b> at lower frequency. It reports a simulation to show the scattering and descattering of <b>pulse</b> <b>profiles</b> and PPA curves. As a practical application, lower-frequency profiles and PPA curves of PSR 1356 - 60, PSR 1831 - 03, PSR 1838 + 04, PSR 1859 + 03, PSR 1946 + 35 are obtained.

40|$|The {{shapes of}} <b>pulse</b> <b>profiles,</b> {{especially}} their variations {{with respect to}} observing frequencies, {{are very important to}} understand emission mechanisms of pulsars, while no previous attempt has been made in interpreting the complicated phenomenology.

40|$|We {{report the}} timing and {{spectral}} properties of Be/X-ray binary pulsar GX 304 - 1 by using two Suzaku observations during its 2010 August and 2012 January X-ray outbursts. Pulsations at 275 s were clearly detected in the light curves from both the observations. <b>Pulse</b> <b>profiles</b> {{were found to be}} strongly energy-dependent. During 2010 observation, prominent dips seen in soft X-ray (≤ 10 keV) <b>pulse</b> <b>profiles</b> were found to be absent at higher energies. However, during 2012 observation, the <b>pulse</b> <b>profiles</b> were complex due to the presence of several dips. Significant changes {{in the shape of the}} <b>pulse</b> <b>profiles</b> were detected at high energies (> 35 keV). A phase shift of ∼ 0. 3 was detected while comparing the phase of main dip in <b>pulse</b> <b>profiles</b> below and above ∼ 35 keV. Broad-band energy spectrum of pulsar was well described by a partially absorbed Negative and Positive power-law with Exponential cutoff (NPEX) model with 6. 4 keV iron line and a cyclotron absorption feature. Energy of cyclotron absorption line was found to be ∼ 53 and 50 keV for 2010 and 2012 observations, respectively, indicating a marginal positive dependence on source luminosity. Based on the results obtained from phase-resolved spectroscopy, the absorption dips in the <b>pulse</b> <b>profiles</b> can be interpreted as due to the presence of additional matter at same phases. Observed positive correlation between cyclotron line energy and luminosity, and significant pulse-phase variation of cyclotron parameters are discussed in the perspective of theoretical models on cyclotron absorption line in X-ray pulsars.

40|$|The Petrova (2000) {{model to}} {{calculate}} <b>pulse</b> <b>profiles</b> is extended to a variable emission height model {{to make it}} physically self-consistent. In this context variable means that the emission height is no longer {{considered to be the}} same for different magnetic field lines. The <b>pulse</b> <b>profiles</b> calculated using this new model seem to be less realistic due to a focusing effect and cannot be used to fit (typical) multifrequency pulsar observations. Apart from the focusing effect the general morphology of <b>pulse</b> <b>profiles</b> is not greatly affected by introducing a variable emission height.

40|$|The {{equation}} of state of cold supra-nuclear-density matter, such as in neutron stars, {{is an open question}} in astrophysics. A promising method for constraining the neutron star {{equation of}} state is modelling <b>pulse</b> <b>profiles</b> of thermonuclear X-ray burst oscillations from hotspots on accreting neutron stars. The <b>pulse</b> <b>profiles,</b> constructed using spherical and oblate neutron star models, are comparable to what would be observed by a next-generation X-ray timing instrument like ASTROSAT, NICER, or LOFT. In this paper, we showcase the use of an evolutionary optimization algorithm to fit <b>pulse</b> <b>profiles</b> to determine the best-fit masses and radii. By fitting synthetic data, we assess how well the optimization algorithm can recover the input parameters. Multiple Poisson realizations of the synthetic <b>pulse</b> <b>profiles,</b> constructed with 1. 6 million counts and no background, were fitted with the Ferret algorithm to analyze both statistical and degeneracy-related uncertainty, and to explore how the goodness-of-fit depends on the input parameters.

50|$|Recent {{advances}} in signal processing techniques {{have made the}} use of pulse profiling or shaping more common. By shaping the pulse envelope before it {{is applied to the}} transmitting device, say to a cosine law or a trapezoid, the bandwidth can be limited at source, with less reliance on filtering. When this technique is combined with pulse compression, then a good compromise between efficiency, performance and range resolution can be realised. The diagram on the left shows the effect on the spectrum if a trapezoid <b>pulse</b> <b>profile</b> is adopted. It can be seen that the energy in the sidebands is significantly reduced compared to the main lobe and the amplitude of the main lobe is increased.|$|E
50|$|For a {{long time}} the Seven were {{considered}} to be steady sources, to the point that RX J0720.4-3125 was included among the calibration sources for the EPIC and RGS instruments on board the orbital X-ray telescope XMM-Newton. The continuous monitoring revealed however that the source underwent conspicuous changes in the period 2001-2003. In particular, while the total flux stayed more or less constant, the blackbody temperature steadily increased, going from about 86 to over 90 eV. This was accompanied by a change of the <b>pulse</b> <b>profile,</b> with an increase of the pulsed fraction. More recently this trend seems to have reversed. Starting from 2004, the temperature decreased, and there are hints that the overall evolution may be cyclic, with a period of about 10 years.|$|E
50|$|In {{applying}} the photoacoustic effect there exist various modes of measurement. Gaseous samples or condensed phase samples, where {{the pressure is}} measured in the surrounding gaseous phase, are usually probed with a microphone. The useful applicable time-scale {{in this case is}} in the millisecond to sub-second scale. Most often, In this case, the exciting light is continuously chopped or modulated at a certain frequency (mostly in the range between ca. 10-10000 Hz) and the modulated photoacoustic signal is analyzed with a lock-in amplifier for its amplitude and phase, or for the inphase and quadrature components. When the pressure is measured within the condensed phase of the probed specimen, one utilizes piezoelectric sensors inserted into or coupled to the specimen itself. In this case the time scale is between less than nanoseconds to many microseconds The photoacoustic signal, obtained from the various pressure sensors, depends on the physical properties of the system, the mechanism that creates the photoacoustic signal, the light-absorbing material, the dynamics of the excited state relaxation and the modulation frequency or the <b>pulse</b> <b>profile</b> of the radiation, as well as the sensor properties. This calls for appropriate procedures to (i) separate between the signals due to different mechanisms and (ii) to obtain the time dependence of the heat evolution (in the case of the photothermal mechanism) or the oxygen evolution (in the case of the photobaric mechanism in photosynthesis) or the time dependence of the volume changes, from the time dependence of the resulting photoacoustic signal.|$|E

40|$|We offer two {{possible}} explanations {{to account for}} the characteristics of integrated <b>pulse</b> <b>profiles,</b> in particular their degree of complexity, their variation from pulsar to pulsar, their stability, and the tendency of complex profiles to be associated with older pulsars. It is proposed that the pulse structure could be a reflection of surface irregularities at the polar caps, and it is shown how the surface relief can affect the number of positrons released into the magnetosphere which are subsequently responsible for the observed radio radiation. The electrons produced in the vacuum break-down in the gap carry enough energy to allow creating such a surface relief in ~ 10 - 6 years, and one way in which this could be achieved is discussed. Alternatively, the presence of multi pole components in the magnetic fields of older pulsars could lead to significant variations in the curvature of the field lines across the gap, and hence to structure in the integrated <b>pulse</b> <b>profiles.</b> An assessment of the two hypotheses from observed <b>pulse</b> <b>profiles</b> seems to favour the polar cap relief picture...|$|R

Then, we find that the <b>pulse</b> <b>profile</b> from the scalarized neutron star in scalar-tensor gravity is almost the same as that in general relativity, i. e., without a scalar field, if the stellar compactness of the both stars is very similar. That is, the existence of the scalar field does not directly change the <b>pulse</b> <b>profile</b> from the neutron star, while the stellar compactness is crucial for determining the pulse shape even in the scalar-tensor gravity. Additionally, we find that the pulse shape from the scalarized neutron star is more or less similar to that from the neutron star with the same mass in general relativity, while the ratio of the minimum amplitude to the maximum amplitude in the <b>pulse</b> <b>profile</b> depend strongly on the coupling constant in scalar-tensor gravity, depending on the angle between the rotational and magnetic axes and the angle between the rotational axis and the direction to the observer.
