5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of psoriasis is usually {{based on the}} appearance of the skin.

50|$|The {{surficial}} geology {{near the}} mouth of East Branch Martins Creek mainly consists of alluvium and a till known as Wisconsinan Till.

5|$|Tangascootack Creek's {{watershed}} covers 36.4 {{square miles}} (94km2) {{in the southern}} part of Clinton County, half of which is the watershed for North Fork Tangascootack Creek. A small amount of the watershed, less than 1%, has occasional residential uses, including sport camps and summer retreats. In formerly strip-mined areas there are <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> grassland and reforestation. Almost all of the area that is considered impaired by the Environmental Protection Agency, is forested. However, in areas where strip mining was done in the past, there are <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> grassland or reforested land. This land includes sports camps and summer retreats.|$|E
5|$|The {{thyroid gland}} {{is found in}} all vertebrates. In fish, it is usually located below the gills and is not always divided into {{distinct}} lobes.

5|$|A {{total of}} 80 {{percent of the}} Abrahams Creek {{watershed}} is rural and 20 percent is urbanized. The lower reaches of the watershed contain most of the urbanization.

The Bunker Hill-Mount Lookout Ridge is too steep to be developed, but many {{other areas of the}} watershed could easily be urbanized. The mining-affected land in the watershed is in West Wyoming.|$|E

5|$|Callisto's surface has an albedo {{of about}} 20%. Its surface {{composition}} {{is thought to}} be broadly similar to its composition as a whole. Near-infrared spectroscopy has revealed the presence of water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 micrometers. Water ice seems to be ubiquitous on the surface of Callisto, with a mass fraction of 2550%. The analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared and UV spectra obtained by the Galileo spacecraft and from the ground has revealed various non-ice materials: magnesium- and iron-bearing hydrated silicates, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, on Callisto with the Hubble Space Telescope|year=1996|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Science XXXI| url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc97/pdf/1852.PDF|page=1852|format=PDF}} and possibly ammonia and various organic compounds. Spectral data indicate that Callisto's surface is extremely heterogeneous at the small scale. Small, bright <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> pure water ice are intermixed with <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> a rock–ice mixture and extended dark areas made of a non-ice material.|$|E
5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} (also {{known as}} disruptive camouflage or disruptive patterning) {{is a form}} of camouflage that works by breaking up the outlines of an animal, soldier or military vehicle with a strongly contrasting pattern. It is often combined with other methods of crypsis including background colour matching and countershading. It appears paradoxical as a way of not being seen, since disruption of outlines depends on high contrast, so the <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> colour are themselves conspicuous.|$|E

Four to seven percent of the Nescopeck Creek watershed consists of mines, quarries, and gravel pits.|$|E
5|$|In some {{specimens}} of S.luteus, the partial veil separates from the stipe (rather than the cap margin), leaving cottony <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> veil {{hanging from the}} cap margin.

5|$|Inverse {{psoriasis}} (also {{known as}} flexural psoriasis) appears as smooth, inflamed <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> skin.

Heat, trauma, and infection are thought {{to play a role}} in the development of this atypical form of psoriasis.|$|E

5|$|Psoriasis is a {{long-lasting}} {{autoimmune disease}} characterized by <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> abnormal skin. These skin patches are typically red, itchy, and scaly.

5|$|Scotch Run {{flows through}} the Scotch Valley. The stream flows over the lowest point between Nescopeck Mountain and McCauley Mountain. Scotch Valley is {{relatively}} narrow, but becomes somewhat wider downstream of Mifflin Cross Roads. A pond or small lake {{is located at the}} stream's headwaters. A few <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> wetland on the National Wetlands Inventory are near the stream. It is flanked by a 100 year floodplain throughout its entire length.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals such as}} many moths, mantises and grasshoppers, have a {{repertory}} {{of threatening}} or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots or <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> bright and contrasting colours, so as to scare off or momentarily distract a predator. This gives the prey animal an opportunity to escape. The behaviour is deimatic (startling) rather than aposematic as these insects are palatable to predators, so the warning colours are a bluff, not an honest signal.|$|E

5|$|The Thayer {{system was}} white with large {{polygonal}} <b>patches</b> <b>of</b> light sea blue (called Thayer Blue).
