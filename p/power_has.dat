Emerging near Black Mesa's classification yards, Calhoun learns that Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues plan to escape the facility using teleportation technology. After freeing Rosenberg from the captivity of the US Marines detachment sent to silence the facility, Calhoun escorts him to a decommissioned prototype teleportation laboratory, where several Black Mesa employees have already gathered. Rosenberg then teleports Calhoun to the Xen border world to calibrate research equipment needed to pinpoint a teleport destination outside of Black Mesa. Upon his return, Rosenberg informs Calhoun that the teleporter's battery <b>power</b> <b>has</b> been exhausted, and contact has been lost with a team sent to acquire a new power cell.|$|E

If an error concerning a precedent fact is made, the statutory <b>power</b> <b>has</b> not been exercised lawfully and may be quashed by the High Court if judicial review is applied for by an aggrieved person. The willingness of the Court to review such errors of fact is an exception to the general rule that the Court only reviews errors of law.|$|E
5|$|Food {{power is}} an {{integral}} part of the politics of food. The idea of food power is used in embargoes, employment, and food politics. In order for a nation to utilize food power effectively, the nation must effectively apply and display scarcity, supply concentration, demand dispersion, and action independence. The four main nations that export enough agriculture to be able to exert food power are the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. On the smaller scale, particularly in some African countries, food <b>power</b> <b>has</b> been used as a weapon by opposing sides in internal wars and conflicts against their own people.|$|E

It {{is set in the}} Genroku period, itself within the larger Edo period, during the reign of the shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi. Tsunayoshi's thirst for <b>power</b> <b>has</b> created conflict around ownership of the Demon Blades, samurai swords forged by the legendary swordsmith Muramasa Sengo that crave blood when drawn and bring madness and death to those foolish enough to draw them. Due to the chaos generated by this, the Demon Blades' powers begin summoning demons from Hell, along with causing ancient gods to stir from long slumber.|$|E

Siemens Wind <b>Power</b> <b>has</b> rotor-blade production and testing facilities in Aaborg. In 2012 and 2013, there were additions in both areas. The new testing plant is the world's largest research test centre for wind turbine technology. In 2012, the company shipped a record 570 wind turbine blades from the Port of Aalborg, mainly to England and Ireland, up 45% on the previous year.|$|E
5|$|The {{process by}} which an {{organisation}} achieves sufficient prominence that {{it is able to}} exercise naked power can be described as the rule of three phases (Russell 1938:63). According to this rule, what begins as fanaticism {{on the part of some}} crowd eventually produces conquest by means of naked power. Eventually, the acquiescence of the outlying population transforms naked power into traditional power. Finally, once a traditional <b>power</b> <b>has</b> taken hold, it engages in the suppression of dissent by the use of naked power.|$|E
5|$|This {{alliance}} probably forced Bolesław the Pious {{to reconsider}} his threatment of his nephew and finally granted him the Duchy of Poznań in 1273. Przemysł II, in exchange, not only interrupted {{for a time}} his cooperation with the Duke of Wrocław, but decided to support his uncle in the expedition against Władysław of Opole (ally of King Ottokar II and Henryk IV Probus), {{in retaliation for the}} attempts of the Opole ruler to overthrow the government of Bolesław V the Chaste in Lesser Poland {{during the first half of}} 1273. Thus, with high probability it can be concluded that by this time the conflict between Przemysł II and his uncle for <b>power</b> <b>has</b> been finally resolved.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{initiatives}} {{are working to}} reduce costs of electric power from offshore wind. One example is the Carbon Trust Offshore Wind Accelerator, a joint industry project, involving nine offshore wind developers, which aims {{to reduce the cost}} of offshore wind by 10% by 2015. It has been suggested that innovation at scale could deliver 25% cost reduction in offshore wind by 2020. Henrik Stiesdal, former Chief Technical Officer at Siemens Wind <b>Power,</b> <b>has</b> stated that by 2025 energy from offshore wind {{will be one of the}} cheapest, scalable solutions in the UK, compared to other renewables and fossil fuel energy sources, if the true cost to society is factored into the cost of energy equation. He calculates the cost at that time to be 43 EUR/MWh for onshore, and 72 EUR/MWh for offshore wind.|$|E
5|$|Although {{skeptical of}} New World Order conspiracism, {{political}} scientist David Rothkopf argues, in the 2008 book , {{that the world}} population of 6 billion people is governed by an elite of 6,000 individuals. Until the late 20th century, governments of the great powers provided most of the superclass, accompanied by a few heads of international movements (i.e., the Pope of the Catholic Church) and entrepreneurs (Rothschilds, Rockefellers). According to Rothkopf, in the early 21st century, economic clout—fueled by the explosive expansion of international trade, travel and communication—rules; the nation-state's <b>power</b> <b>has</b> diminished shrinking politicians to minority power broker status; leaders in international business, finance and the defense industry not only dominate the superclass, they move freely into high positions in their nations' governments and back to private life largely beyond the notice of elected legislatures (including the U.S. Congress), which remain abysmally ignorant of affairs beyond their borders. He asserts that the superclass' disproportionate influence over national policy is constructive but always self-interested, and that across the world, few object to corruption and oppressive governments provided they can do business in these countries.|$|E
5|$|Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs is {{a seminal}} case in {{administrative}} law {{decided by the}} Court of Appeal of Singapore in 1988. The Court decided the appeal in the appellants' favour on a technical ground, but considered obiter dicta the reviewability of government power in preventive detention cases under the Internal Security Act ("ISA"). The case approved the application by the court of an objective test in the review of government discretion under the ISA, stating that all <b>power</b> <b>has</b> legal limits {{and the rule of}} law demands that the courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power. This was a landmark shift from the position in the 1971 High Court decision Lee Mau Seng v. Minister of Home Affairs, which had been an authority for the application of a subjective test until it was overruled by Chng Suan Tze.|$|E
