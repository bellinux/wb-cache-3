40|$|In {{a beauty}} contest framework, welfare can {{decrease}} with <b>public</b> <b>information</b> if {{the precision of}} private information is exogenous, whereas welfare necessarily increases with <b>public</b> <b>information</b> if the precision is endogenous with linear costs of information acquisition. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to reconcile these results by considering nonlinear costs of information acquisition. The main result of this paper is a necessary and sufficient condition for welfare to increase with <b>public</b> <b>information.</b> Using it, we show that costs of information acquisition are linear if and only if welfare necessarily increases with <b>public</b> <b>information.</b> Thus, welfare can decrease with <b>public</b> <b>information</b> for any strictly convex costs.

However, the physiological mechanisms by which direct foraging assessments and <b>public</b> <b>information</b> are integrated to affect behaviour remain largely unknown.

Here, we show that <b>public</b> <b>information</b> can attenuate or intensify the release of glucocorticoids (i. e. stress hormones) during food shortage in red crossbills. The observed modulation of corticosterone may therefore be a physiological mechanism linking <b>public</b> <b>information,</b> direct environmental assessments and behavioural change. This mechanism would not only allow for <b>public</b> <b>information</b> to affect individual behaviour, but might also facilitate group decision making by bringing group members into more similar physiological states.
