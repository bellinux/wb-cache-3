40|$|Inhibited {{encoding}} is {{the basis}} of some accounts of repetition blindness—impaired report of the second occurrence of a repeated word in a rapidly presented word sequence. The author presents evidence for the claim that repetition effects arise from constructive processes of perception and memory that occur to some extent after the word sequence has been presented. Unpredictable <b>postlist</b> cues prompted subjects to report either the entire list or just the final word in the list. Repetition impaired the report of the second occurrence of a repeated word under full report but facilitated the report of such items when only the final word had to be reported. The author modulated this dissociation by presenting repeated words in sentences rather than unrelated word lists. The sensitivity of the effects of repetition to <b>postlist</b> cues supports a construction rather than an encoding inhibition account of repetition blindness. Perception and memory of events have been characterized by some as acts of construction or reconstruction (Bartlett, 1932; Gregory, 1970; Helmholtz, 1866 / 1962; Neisser, 1967, 1976). A crucial aspect of such a view is that experience arises from a dynamic interaction between environmental stimuli and representations in memory. Powerful examples of this interaction hav...|$|E
40|$|After firms move {{trading in}} their stock to the American or New York Stock Exchanges, stock returns are {{generally}} poor. Although many listing firms issue equity {{around the time}} of listing, <b>postlisting</b> performance is not entirely explained by the equity issuance puzzle. Similar to the conclusions regarding other long-run phenomena, poor <b>postlisting</b> performance appears related to managers timing their application for listing. Managers of smaller firms, where initial listing requirements may be more binding, tend to apply for listing before a decline in performance. Poor <b>postlisting</b> performance is not observed in larger firms. Copyright 1995 by American Finance Association. ...|$|R
40|$|Public listing {{is a key}} {{and unique}} reform measure for large {{state-owned}} enterprises (SOEs) in China. Using a panel data set that contains both pre- and <b>postlisting</b> financial and ownership information on publicly listed firms in Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges, we explore the effects of public listing in China. We find that using public listings {{as a means to}} reform SOEs has not worked wonders: company performance in the post-listing years are sharply lower than their levels in both the prelisting years and the initial public offering years. Moreover, the effects of public listing on performance are not significantly affected by the percentage of state shares or of the total shares held by top shareholders, but are positively correlated with a more balanced ownership structure among these shareholders...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the pricing {{and performance of}} initial public offerings (IPOs) in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) from February 1997 to October 2008. Underpricing is calculated using headline underpricing, underpricing issuer loss, underpricing loss by market value, and underpricing loss by issuer price. The results show that average underpricing of 17. 60 %, 5. 01 %, 6. 94 %, 6. 68 %, and 16. 10 %, respectively. This is a significantly lower level of underpricing than previously documented in Thailand before the 1997 Asian financial crisis. We assess <b>postlisting</b> performance using monthly cumulative abnormal returns, buy-and-hold returns, and wealth relatives. These findings indicate that Thai IPOs generally outperform market benchmarks up to 24 months and underperform thereafter up to 36 months. However, there is much variation in long-run performance among industries. For example, multiple regression analysis shows that IPOs in the financial services industry perform relatively better in the longer run. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|NETSPEAK is a Web service {{which helps}} writers in finding {{alternative}} expressions {{for what they}} want to say. 1 It provides a large index of writing samples in the form of n-grams, n ≤ 5, along with an efficient means to retrieve them by the use of wildcard queries. When in doubt about a phrasing, a user can get additional evidence by retrieving samples that match a given context. The figure below shows the results for a query where a user is interested in the two most frequently written words between “looks” and “me”. The first two columns give an idea about the customariness of each result, and the user can select the one most appropriate for her sentence. To provide a rich choice of writing samples we index the Google n-gram corpus which was compiled from {{a large portion of the}} English Web and which consists of more than 3 billion n-grams along with their occurrence frequencies [2]. We have developed a space-optimal inverted index based on minimal perfect hashing. The hash function maps the vocabulary V of the corpus to the storage positions of <b>postlists.</b> A hash function is perfect if it does not produce hash collisions for the key set V, and it is minimal if the number of storage positions required does not exceed |V |. The hash function is constructed with the CHD algorithm which produces a space overhead of 2. 07 × |V | bits [1]. Moreover, the index provides a top-k retrieval strategy to find the n-grams matching a query; details can be found in [3]. The table below shows selected performance data of our index. NETSPEAK is currently deployed on a cluster of 15 computers. In a load test the service was measured to process about 10 000 queries per second.

40|$|Alcoholic {{liver disease}} (ALD) {{is a leading}} {{indication}} for liver transplantation. Our center has randomly checked blood alcohol levels (BALs) in ALD patients {{on the waiting list}} since 2004. We aimed to identify the incidence and predictors of inactivation on the transplant list due to alcohol use and to determine the utility of BAL-screening in this process. We conducted a retrospective review of patients with ALD listed for liver transplantation with at least 3 months of <b>postlisting</b> follow-up. Alcohol use while on the transplant list was defined as a positive BAL, an admission of alcohol use, or refusal to perform screening within 12 hours of request. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate risk ratios (RRs). Of 134 patients meeting eligibility criteria, 78 % were male, and mean age was 52 years. Alcohol use was documented in 23 patients (17 %). Of these, 12 refused to have a random screen, 8 had detectable serum ethanol levels, and 3 had self-reported alcohol use. On multivariable analysis, a higher number of random BAL-checks [RR 0. 63 (0. 52, 0. 76), P 0. 001] and a longer duration of prelisting abstinence [RR 0. 88 (0. 83, 0. 94), P 0. 001] independently reduced the risk of alcohol use by patients while on the waiting list. None of the patients with 24 months of prelisting abstinence had a positive screen. In conclusion, this study supports random BAL-screening before transplantation and reinforces the importance of abstinence duration as a predictor of relapse. For patients with 24 months of prelisting abstinence, our center will increase the frequency of random BAL screening and increase the rehabilitation requirements to include an intensive 3 -week rehabilitation program. We hope that these measures will reduce the rate of relapse to alcohol use post-transplantation. Liver Transpl 16 : 91 - 97, 2010. © 2009 AASLD...|$|R
