50|$|The <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>science</b> is the {{manipulation}} <b>of</b> <b>science</b> for political gain. It occurs when government, business, or advocacy groups use legal or economic pressure {{to influence the}} findings of scientific research or {{the way it is}} disseminated, reported or interpreted. The <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>science</b> may also negatively affect academic and scientific freedom. Historically, groups have conducted various campaigns to promote their interests in defiance of scientific consensus, and in an effort to manipulate public policy.|$|R

40|$|Scholars <b>of</b> <b>science</b> {{and society}} have long {{understood}} {{that in all}} but the most trivial <b>of</b> cases <b>science</b> cannot compel specific political outcomes. Rather, scientific understandings are frequently either intrinsically uncertain or diverse enough to be used to justify a range of competing political agendas. This paper argues that despite these understandings the use <b>of</b> <b>science</b> by scientists as a means of negotiating for desired political outcomes – the <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>science</b> by scientists – threatens the development of effective policies in contested issues. By tying themselves to politics, rather than policy, scientists necessarily restrict their value and the value <b>of</b> their <b>science.</b> The essay proceeds in four parts. It first discusses why the <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>science</b> by scientists might be worth our concern. Second, it reviews the debate over the publication of The Skeptical Environmentalist. Third, it suggests that arguments that embraces a “linear model ” (i. e., get the facts right, then act) <b>of</b> <b>science’s</b> relationship with policy encourage the <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>science.</b> The fourth section discusses a range of perspectives on the <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>science</b> by scientists, and the paper concludes with a discussion of an alternative way to think about the relationship between science, politics and policy. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-Michael Crichton's book State of Fear {{addresses}} the <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>science,</b> {{in particular the}} topics of climate change and global warming, through the vehicle of a novel. In the author's opinion, Crichton is correct: the field of climate research has become highly politicized. An example {{is provided by the}} revisionist efforts of some researchers to extinguish the existence of a Medieval Warm Period. The <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>science</b> is a threat to the process of free inquiry necessary for human progress. Keywords: global warming-temperature-Crichton-climate-Medieval Warm Period On December 26, 2004, a magnitude 9. 0 earthquake occurred off the coast of Northern Sumatra. The massive temblor, the largest in 40 years, spawned tsunamis that killed more than 280, 000 people.

30|$|In that context, {{political}} robustness meets epistemic robustness in {{the illusion}} of knowledge, control, and security about the future, opening {{the door for a}} <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>science</b> and a would-be scientification of politics.

25|$|The <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>science</b> in {{the sense}} of a {{manipulation}} <b>of</b> <b>science</b> for political gains is a part of the political process. It is part of the controversies about intelligent design (compare the Wedge strategy) or Merchants of Doubt, scientists that are under suspicion to willingly obscure findings. e.g. about issues like tobacco smoke, ozone depletion, global warming or acid rain. However, e.g. in case of the Ozone depletion, global regulation based on the Montreal Protocol has been successful, in a climate of high uncertainty and against strong resistance while in case of Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol failed.|$|R

40|$|Effectively {{addressing}} {{climate change}} requires {{significant changes in}} individual and collective human behavior and decision-making. Yet, in light <b>of</b> the increasing <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> (climate) <b>science,</b> and the attempts of vested-interest groups to undermine the scientific consensus on climate change through organized “disinformation campaigns,” identifying ways to effectively engage with {{the public about the}} issue across the political spectrum has proven difficult. A growing body of research suggests that one promising way to counteract the <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>science</b> is to convey the high level of normative agreement (“consensus”) among experts about the reality of human-caused climate change. Yet, much prior research examining public opinion dynamics in the context of climate change has done so under conditions with limited external validity. Moreover, no research to date has examined how to protect the public from the spread of influential misinformation about climate change. The current research bridges this divide by exploring how people evaluate and process consensus cues in a polarized information environment. Furthermore, evidence is provided {{that it is possible to}} preemptively protect (“inoculate”) public attitudes about climate change against real-world misinformation...|$|R

Glick’s notion of civil discourse has been picked up far afield—in Spanish business history and in the history <b>of</b> <b>science</b> in 20th century China, for example. His interest in civil discourse led him to Emilio Herrera, a politically conservative general who remained loyal to the Second Republic, and was, at the same time, the pioneer of modern aeronautics in Spain. Glick edited his memoirs and contributed a study of Herrera’s role in aeronautical engineering.|$|R

50|$|Bethell, {{a senior}} editor at American Spectator, and a former editor of the Washington Monthly aims to deal with what conservatives have seen as the <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>science.</b> He {{addresses}} a number of issues, including global warming, nuclear power, DDT and control of malaria, HIV/AIDS denialism, cloning, genetic engineering, intelligent design, the trial of Galileo and the relationship between science and Christianity. On all these topics, Bethell argues that the Left have distorted scientific facts in order to advance their political agenda and to increase the size of government, often through scare campaigns like the risk of runaway climate change. He also states that the Left have tried to censor those scientists who disagree with their viewpoints, regardless of what the best scientific evidence might say.|$|R
30|$|Depoliticizing policymaking {{leads to}} a lack of {{political}} debate with a disclosure of economic interests, ideological commitments and cultural values. It can also lead to deepening of opposing views (clad as scientific conflict), and eventually {{to a lack of}} broad social acceptance (see also Sarewitz 2004), which seems to be the current state of climate policy. In turn, the <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>science</b> {{leads to a}}n exaggerated encroachment of political, economic and social utility into the scientific research and the interpretation of scientific findings––which goes along with a declining acceptance <b>of</b> climate <b>science</b> as an authority in unraveling complex phenomena and developments.

30|$|Secondly, Vavilov {{would have}} liked {{nothing more than to}} stave off famine and {{starvation}} by improving essential food crops. This urgency was internal, fueling his desire to immediately begin the fight to end famine and poor crop yields. But, as any plant breeder can attest, such improvements are better measured in years rather than months. However, with the political rise of Trofin Lysenko, the son of a peasant, came a person promising immediate improvements based on accelerating the growth of plants by treating seeds with low temperatures and moisture. Following his work on plants in 1928, he called this process “vernalization.” Thus began the <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>science,</b> with Lysenko the peasant scientist on one extreme rejecting Mendelian science, and Vavilov, the progressive higly educated scientist on the other extreme, bringing modern science to his home country.|$|R

Moving beyond existing criticism which argues that the zombie transforms to fit each generation’s specific fears, I argue that zombie movies, novels, and video games from George A.

Consequently, the zombie’s unprecedented mainstream popularity over the last fifteen years could be read as symptomatic of this distrust intensifying, paralleling an increasing <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> <b>science</b> and a rise in apocalyptic thinking within the public sphere. Through the deconstruction of my own zombie story, I uncover not only what these timely narratives tell us about our perceptions of the future, but also how they can help us change them...|$|R
