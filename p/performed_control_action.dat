40|$|Abstract — Swapping {{modularity}} {{refers to}} the use of common units to create product variants.

Component swapping modularity in control systems can be achieved by utilizing “smart ” components which can <b>perform</b> <b>control</b> <b>actions</b> within the module, and bidirectional network communication. In this paper we analyze an engine speed control system from the perspective of achieving swapping modularity of the throttle actuator. Specifically, we analyze approaches to distribute the optimal controller transfer function between a throttle actuator time constant dependent portion (which is swappable with the actuator) and throttle actuator time constant independent portion (which {{does not need to be}} changed when the actuator is swapped).

40|$|Abstract—Availability of {{low-cost}} electronics {{has led to}} a new breed of control system components, so-called smart components, which can <b>perform</b> <b>control</b> <b>actions</b> in the actuator and sensor components {{as well as in the}} controller. “Smart ” components can communicate bidirectionally in networked control systems (NCSs). One can improve control system performance and design due to the decentralized, yet more connected, nature of these systems. Current research on NCSs primarily focuses on communication loss and delay. This paper investigates the potential benefits of bidirectional communication in a feedback control loop, which is at the heart of so many applications. First, a definition and quantification of component-swapping modularity is presented. Next, an optimal design formulation is presented for an NCS that maximizes component-swapping modularity. The approach is then demonstrated with an example of driveshaft speed control with a dc motor.
