5|$|Although Utica's {{population}} is predominantly European American, it has diversified since the 1990s. New immigrants and refugees have included Bosnians (displaced by the Bosnian War), Russians, Burmese, Vietnamese, and Latinos. More than 15 languages are spoken in the city. Utica {{has a low}} cost of living but its industrial and economic decline have posed difficulties for <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> make a new start.|$|E
5000|$|Anarcho-capitalist scholar Murray Rothbard stated: [...] "a {{just war}} exists when a <b>people</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> {{ward off the}} threat of coercive {{domination}} by another people, or to overthrow an already-existing domination. A war is unjust, on the other hand, when a <b>people</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> impose domination on another <b>people,</b> or <b>try</b> <b>to</b> retain an already existing coercive rule over them." ...|$|R

5|$|They {{visited the}} Trianon gardens again on several occasions, but {{were unable to}} trace the path they took. Various landmarks, such as the kiosk and the bridge, were missing, and the grounds were full of <b>people.</b> <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> {{come up with an}} explanation, they {{wondered}} if they had stumbled across a private party or an event booked that day. However, they found that nothing had been booked that afternoon. During their research, they thought they recognised the man by the kiosk as the Comte de Vaudreuil, a friend of Marie Antoinette, who herself had been thought to have been seen by Moberly.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} Baltic region of Livonia, people {{designated}} as werewolves went underground {{in the shape}} of dogs to fight against sorcerers who stole the shoots of the grain. If the werewolves failed to wrest the shoots, there would be famine. In Romania, strigoi were people born with a caul, which they donned upon reaching adulthood; this made them invisible. They then travelled in animal form to the meadow {{at the end of the}} world. There they fought each other all night, becoming reconciled in the morning. The reason for the fight is not specified. The Circassians told that, on a certain night of the year, their sorcerers fought with the sorcerers of the Abkhaz <b>people,</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> suck each other's blood.|$|E
5|$|Reality TV was {{a popular}} genre of {{television}} programming in the UK in 2002. The third series of the UK version of Big Brother—which was showing while Russian's con took place—attracted audience figures of approximately 5.8million. Most British reality TV programmes at the time centred on a team of <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> accomplish a specific goal or target. For example, the 2000 series Jailbreak challenged a group to escape from a mock prison, while the 2001 series The Mole gave the contestants the task of discovering which of them was sabotaging their attempts to win money. Most reality TV shows offered a cash reward to successful participants—both Jailbreak and the first series of The Mole offered a prize of £100,000.|$|E

50|$|Not infrequently, some {{of these}} {{different}} senses of professional criticism are mixed together, especially when <b>people</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> pretend somebody's criticism is authoritative (they {{seem to have a}} professional expertise, although they really lack this expertise), or when <b>people</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> pretend that somebody's criticism is not authoritative (they are treated as no better than the rest, although in reality they are highly professional, and more competent and experienced than the rest).|$|R
5|$|The first {{lifeboat}} launched was Lifeboat 7 on {{the starboard}} side with 28 people on board out of a capacity of 65. It was lowered at around 12:45am as believed by the British Inquiry. Collapsible Boat D was the last lifeboat to be launched, at 2:05. Two more lifeboats, Collapsible Boats A and B, {{were in the process}} of being removed from their location on the roof of the officer's house but could not be properly launched. Collapsible B floated away from the ship upside down, while Collapsible A became half-filled with water after the supports for its canvas sides were broken in the fall from the roof of the officers' quarters. There were arguments in some of the lifeboats about going back to pick up people in the water, but many survivors were afraid of being swamped by <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> climb into the lifeboat or being pulled down by the suction from the sinking Titanic, though it turned out that there had been very little suction. At 2:20am, Titanic herself sank. A small number of passengers and crew were able to make their way to the two unlaunched collapsible boats, surviving for several hours (some still clinging to the overturned Collapsible B) until they were rescued by Fifth Officer Harold Lowe.|$|E
25|$|The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency {{suggested}} <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> contact {{those in}} the vicinity use text messaging instead of voice calls because of crowded cellphone lines. Cellphone service in Boston was congested but remained in operation, despite some local media reports stating that cell service was shut down to prevent cell phones from being used as detonators.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the reasons}} there are textual {{problems}} {{is that there was}} no copyright of writings at the time. As a result, Shakespeare and the playing companies he worked with did not distribute scripts of his plays, for fear that the plays would be stolen. This led to bootleg copies of his plays, which were often based on <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> remember what Shakespeare had actually written.|$|E

25|$|In Jersey, {{where the}} school {{children}} were on two weeks holiday {{to help with}} the potato harvest, everyone who wished to leave was asked to register, queues quickly appeared, with 23,000 eventually registering. The civil service could not cope and scared of potential riots with desperate <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get on ships, announcements that it was best to stay in the island resulted in only about 1,000 Jersey children being evacuated with their parents and 67 teachers.|$|E

25|$|Because {{at least}} two of the exits were blocked by the chutes used to bring the show's big cats in and out of the tent, <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> escape could not bypass them. Some died from {{injuries}} sustained after leaping from the tops of the bleachers in hopes they could escape under the sides of the tent, though that method of escape ended up killing more than it saved. Others died after being trampled by other spectators, with some asphyxiating underneath the piles of people who fell over each other.|$|E

25|$|Strict wartime food {{rationing}} {{meant that}} food {{had to be}} found wherever possible. The town’s parks, recreation grounds, open spaces and front gardens of houses were dug up and converted to allotments planted with vegetables. The seafront and pier were packed daily with <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> supplement the food rationing by landing fresh fish. There was a non-profit 'British Restaurant' at the top end of the Windsor Arcade, where families made homeless by the bombing, {{had run out of}} ration coupons or otherwise needed help, could buy a three-course meal for ninepence.|$|E
25|$|Other {{examples}} include jumping {{in front of}} cars as done in Russia. The driving conditions and roads are dangerous with many <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> scam drivers by jumping in front of expensive-looking cars or crashing into them. Hit and runs are very common and insurance companies notoriously specialize in denying claims. Two-way insurance coverage is very expensive and almost completely unavailable for vehicles over ten years old–the drivers can only obtain basic liability. Because Russian courts do not like using verbal claims, most people have dashboard cameras installed to warn would-be perpetrators or provide evidence for/against claims.|$|E
25|$|Guimarães Rosa's {{literature}} is mostly situated in Minas Gerais, with locations widely located across the State (hence the term General, although more concentrated in its north) rather than delimited and identifiable. This northern area {{began to be}} colonized (with brutal conflicts with the large Amerindian population who lived in some parts, especially in Vale do Jequitinhonha) and became accessible to colonists departing from Bahia up north, which made the Portuguese crown insert the region within the state of Minas Gerais's borders {{in order to prevent}} gold and diamond smuggling from <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> avoid colonial taxation and oversight; thus the state of MG was closely watched by the crown because of its tax revenue.|$|E

25|$|On July 20, 2012, not {{far from}} the {{location}} of the aforementioned massacre at Columbine High School, 12 people were killed and 70 people were injured in the 2012 Aurora shooting, when James Eagan Holmes, a former neuroscience doctoral student, walked into an Aurora, Colorado Cinemark movie theater with multiple firearms and tear gas grenades, and started shooting at random at <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> escape during a midnight Thursday showing of The Dark Knight Rises, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others. It was the deadliest shooting in Colorado since the Columbine High School massacre and, in terms of both the dead and wounded in the number of casualties, was the largest single mass shooting in U.S. history.|$|E
25|$|Several peer based organisations {{exist for}} sex workers. The aim of these organisations {{is to support}} the health, rights and well being of sex workers and {{advocate}} on their behalf for law reform {{in order to make}} working safer. Sex work is work and {{there are many people who}} willingly choose it as a job/career. While sex trafficking does exist, not everyone who does sex work is doing so under duress. Social stigma is a major hurdle sex workers encounter, with many <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> 'save' them. Peer support workers and peer educators are seen as best practice by the Sex Industry Network (SIN) when engaging with community members because peers can understand that someone could willingly choose to do sex work.|$|E
25|$|The {{road from}} Albany heading west was first {{constructed}} as a toll road or turnpike {{at the end}} of the 18th century. The First Great Western Turnpike Corporation was chartered in 1799 to build a road from Albany, the capital of New York, to the Revolutionary War frontier town of Cherry Valley. In 1803, a second corporation, the Third Great Western Turnpike, was chartered to further extend the road to Cazenovia. The Third Great Western Turnpike was completed as planned by 1811 and was heavily used by <b>people</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> establish new settlements in central New York. The two turnpikes, collectively known as the Cherry Valley Turnpike, became a stagecoach route in 1816. The Cherry Valley Turnpike name was also later applied to an untolled extension of the road west to Skaneateles.|$|E
