50|$|In the United States and Canada the International Play Equipment Manufacturers Association (IPEMA) {{provides}} a third-party certification service enabled by appointing a testing laboratory {{to determine if}} a particular surface conforms to ASTM standards F1292, F1951, and F2075. IPEMA’s seal on a provider’s document is clear evidence that the covered material has met these tests. Owner/operators should request a copy of this certification for their own protection. Some suppliers do not offer <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>certification</b> and mere membership in IPEMA does not mean that a particular supplier’s material has been certified.

In {{order to}} obtain licensure as an APNP, the above credentials must be obtained first (RN licensure and certification as an APRN). Certification as an APNP is regulated by Chapter N8 of the Wisconsin Nurse Practice Act. In order to apply to take the certification examination for APNPs an individual must complete 45 contact hours in clinical pharmacology/pharmacotherapeutics within the last three years. The application requires <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>certification</b> as an APRN by a certifying body and requires the payment of a fee. Once an individual passes the certification examination, that individual is licensed {{by the state of}} Wisconsin to practice as an APNP. The state of Wisconsin requires an APNP to practice in collaboration with a physician and the relationship must be documented.|$|E

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} introduces several {{characteristics that}} challenge the effectiveness <b>of</b> current <b>certification</b> approaches. Particularly, the on-demand, automated, location-independent, elastic, and multi-tenant nature of cloud computing systems is in contradiction with the static, manual, and human process-oriented evaluation and certification process designed for traditional IT systems. Cloud-specific certification processes can improve {{trust in the}} cloud computing paradigm, {{and can lead to}} the wide adoption of cloud services in enterprises by mastery of uncertainty, lack of transparency, and trust. Through third party evaluation cloud customers could receive more unbiased information about cloud-based services and security measures implemented as well as they could compare different cloud service providers much easier. Common certificates are a backward look at the fulfillment of technical and organizational measures at the time of issue and therefore represent a snapsh ot. This creates a gap between the common <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> one to three years and the high dynamics of the market for cloud services and providers. The proposed dynamic certification approach adopts the common certification process to the increased flexibility and dynamics of cloud computing environments through using of automation potential of security controls and continuous <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>certification</b> status. Dynamic certification is based on a new semi-automated certification process and the continuous monitoring of critical parameters of cloud services...|$|R

5000|$|Pouillon {{began to}} {{investigate}} {{how to become}} an organic certified restaurant and learned that no certification process existed. She decided to set about creating those standards. She worked for two years with Oregon Tilth, a nonprofit membership organization dedicated to supporting and advocating organic food and farming. The Oregon Tilth Certified Organic Program was established in 1982 and is an Accredited Certifying Agent for the USDA’s National Organic Program.The resulting standard required that 95 percent of the food used, as a certified restaurant, must be obtained from USDA certified organic sources. “This meant obtaining <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> organic <b>certification</b> from all our suppliers,” Pouillon says. She complied with the lengthy requirements, and in 1999 Restaurant Nora became the first certified organic restaurant in the country.For many restaurants across the country, achieving and maintaining proof that 95 percent of suppliers are organic is a costly and time-consuming process. As Nora explained to Organic Connections Magazine about becoming certified:“People don’t always understand how complicated and time consuming it is,” Pouillon explains. “Almost {{everything has to be}} organic down to the spices and coffee. It’s {{a lot of work to}} find certified organic farmers and track down certification papers from 35-plus purveyors every year. This process has to be done each year because the certificates have to be renewed each year.” ...|$|R
40|$|Several proof formalisms {{have been}} used, {{and in some}} cases even introduced, in order to define proof systems for modal logic. Our work falls within a more general project of {{establishing}} a common specification language for checking proofs given {{in a wide range of}} deductive formalisms. In this paper, we consider the case <b>of</b> labeled <b>proof</b> systems for modal logics, i. e., in particular, Negri's labeled se-quent calculi, Fitting's prefixed tableaux and free-variable prefixed tableaux, and provide a framework for certifying proofs given in such calculi. The method is based on the use of a translation from the modal language into a first-order polarized language and on a checker whose trusted kernel is a simple implementation of a classical focused sequent calculus. The framework allows for a high flexibility in the representation <b>of</b> <b>proofs</b> to be checked, in the sense that even partial proofs can be verified by employing a process <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> reconstruction. We describe the general method for modal logics characterized by geometric frame conditions, present its implementation in a Prolog-like language, and provide several examples <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> <b>certification</b> in the case of well-known normal modal logics, like K, S 4 and S 5...|$|R

40|$|The {{readability}} of {{two different}} types of electronic identifiers (EID) were evaluated under pastoral production system in North-Eastern Kenya. Physical verification and reading was done at day 0, and 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 months respectively on a total of 1943 beef cattle of which 934 were tagged using ear button tags and 1009 with rumen boluses. The retention rates were recorded and readability determined using a hand-held reader and subsequently compared using a non parametric survival analysis. The results showed that, rumen boluses were more effective with retention and readability of 100 % after the one-year period. The retention rate for ear button tags deteriorated after day 120 to 94. 6 %. This implied that rumen boluses are safe and tamper-proof and are thus recommended for use in pastoral production systems. When tested within the model Livestock Identification and Traceability System (LITS), the use of RFID identifiers were able to substantially contribute to better record keeping, and <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> credible livestock <b>certification.</b> However, due to cost considerations, undertaking a benefit-cost analysis and provisional analysis of the institutional and organisational infrastructure may be critical for successful implementation...|$|R
50|$|At Vortex Spring, {{which claims}} {{on its website}} {{to be the largest}} diving {{facility}} in the state, divers descend into clear waters at a constant temperature of 68 F fed by the Floridan Aquifer. Diving instruction is offered for all levels; experienced divers come for the underwater wildlife and the cavern, which begins at 58 ft below the surface. All divers are required to present <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> open-water <b>certification</b> and sign a release of liability.For the most experienced divers, some of whom come from around the world, the main attraction of Vortex Spring is the cave, which starts 300 ft from the cavern, at a depth of 115 ft. At the entrance is a sign depicting the Grim Reaper and warning divers that the consequences of continuing past that point could be fatal. The cave continues, steadily narrowing, to a locked gate almost 300 ft from the entrance. The dive shop gives the key only to those who can show that they have cave diving certification, which requires two months' training including 125 dives with an instructor or certified diving partner. This policy was instituted after the deaths of 13 divers in the cave during the 1990s, in response to threats from the state to ban diving in the cave entirely. Starting from the gate, over 1600 ft through the area's limestone bedrock have been mapped, to a depth of 310 ft; the cave's full extent is not known. At some points the passage narrows to 10 in, requiring divers who would pass through to take off their tanks and hold them at their sides or in front, and twist their bodies.|$|R
