50|$|The hand {{controller}} is {{the main}} way of controlling the tram. It has an integrated dead-man feature and two buttons on each side (left button controls the light signals, right button controls the bell). The bell can be activated with the button on the control panel, or with the right pedal. The left pedal activates sanding. The vehicle computer and the on-board computer BUSE BS 301 are both controlled by a touchscreen. The vehicle computer diagnoses the tram, displays the speedometer, gives access to the sander status and more. The on-board computer BUSE BS 301 {{takes care of the}} camera system, ticket validation machines, manages the outside and inside displays and controls the acoustic announcement system, as well as the dispatch system and the point controls. The on-board computer has GPS, the stops are announced automatically according to the GPS position, the door status (open or closed) and the distance travelled.

To support the smooth and free view <b>point</b> <b>switching,</b> both matrix-based depth image based rendering and the complex virtual view interpolation schemes are required. In {{order to reduce the}} high computation complexity and avoid the iterative processing scheduling in conventional view interpolation flows, a single iteration view interpolation algorithm is proposed. By use of the proposed algorithm, the redundant warping operations are reduced by 86 %. In addition, based on the proposed artifact detecting and removing algorithm, artifacts due to imperfect depth maps can be detected and eliminated at the same time. Therefore, no additional post-processing or iteration is required and the single iteration processing is achieved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Turnout {{equipment}} plays a {{vital role}} in the safe operation of railroad systems. It is of great importance in ensuring safety and punctuality, and in the smooth operation of <b>point</b> <b>switching</b> mechanisms. Failure of switching gear due to climatic conditions at their site of installation is a frequent occurrence, in particular, breakdown resulting from the effects of snow and ice or of piled-up snow. To prevent this happening, heating equipment can be installed {{to get rid of the}} ice and snow. Generally speaking, a point heater comprises a heating system, an electricity supply unit, and various kinds of sensor. However, overheating sometimes occurs owing to failures caused by inadequate sensor installation, resulting in the heater becoming unusable. Therefore, a converter is proposed to prevent this overheating by controlling the electricity supply to the heater while detecting the ambient temperature without the use of such sensors...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{sponsored by}} the USAF's HQ ESC/AD develops a multilevel secure host-to-hose computer local area network. The design process is presented. The resulting network uses a ring topology with packetized point-to- <b>point</b> <b>switching</b> over fiber optics communication links. For transmission security, packets are source hot-to-destination host encrypted as well as encapsulated with link-to-link encryption. Message transmission is controlled with message acknowledgements and credits within a non-preemptive three priority class queue. A simplified version of the resulting network was validated by applying Jackson's Theorem. Additionally, the simplified view was modeled with a PASCAL simulation program executed on a 64 K microcomputer. Unfortunately, the comparison of the simulation against the analytical results that were obtained using Jackson's Theorem was not possible due to problems modeling the network on the microcomputer. Follow-on work {{in the area of}} simulation is needed to successfully complete the simulation and compare results. (Author) [URL]...|$|E
40|$|During certain load {{conditions}} {{there will}} be considerable reduction or decrease in the efficiency of zero voltage switching half-bridge series resonant inverter and this is mainly because of high switching frequencies. In order to improve efficiency, the technique named variable frequency duty cycle (VFDC) control is used for both the medium and low output power levels with the decreased switching frequencies. VFDC strategy efficiency improvement is achieved {{by means of a}} switching-frequency reduction, mainly at low-medium power range, and with low quality factor loads. And this technique is used in Domestic induction heating application because of its special load characteristics. This paper includes a theoretical analysis of power balance as a function of control parameters, an efficiency analysis to determine the optimum operation <b>point,</b> <b>Switching</b> and conduction losses to examine the overall efficiency improvement are discussed.

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{investigate}} and test for structural change in conditional volatility and micro structure effects in the Australian Share Price Index futures contract. The modelling is conducted around the periods following the introduction of an automated screen-based trading system and alterations to the trading day. Multiple <b>point</b> <b>Switching</b> GARCH models are employed following a detailed examination of conditional volatility, volume and maturity features. The data is sampled at 5, 15 and 30 -minute intervals from transaction records supplied by the Sydney Futures Exchange. Micro-structure features that {{are found to be}} important in the preliminary analysis are incorporated in the formal models. Failure to test for and then account for any of these market features would imply that tests for structural changes are mis-specified. There is significant evidence of structural changes in both the persistence of volatility shocks and simultaneous volume effects following the change to screen trading in this futures market.

40|$|The recent {{development}} for multimedia applications on mobile terminals raised {{the need for}} flexible and scalable computing platforms {{that are capable of}} providing considerable (application specific) computational performance within a low cost and a low energy budget. The MPSoC with multi-disciplinary approach, resolving application mapping, platform architecture and runtime management issues, provides such multiple heterogeneous, flexible processing elements. In MPSoC, the run-time manager takes the design time exploration information as an input and selects an active Pareto point based on quality requirement and available platform resources, where a Pareto point corresponds to a particular parallelization possibility of target application. To use system’s scalability at best and enhance application’s flexibility a step further, the resource management and Pareto point selection decisions need to be adjustable at run-time. This thesis work experiments run-time Pareto <b>point</b> <b>switching</b> for MPEG- 4 encoder. The work involves design time exploration and then embedding of two parallelization possibilities of MPEG- 4 encoder into one single component and enabling run-time switching between parallelizations, to give run-time control over adjusting performance-cost criteria and allocation de-allocation of hardware resources at run-time. The newer system has the capability to encode each video frame with different parallelization. The obtained results offer a number of operating points on Pareto curve in between the previous ones at sequence encoding level. The run-time manager can improve application performance up to 50 % or can save memory bandwidth up to 15 %, according to quality request...|$|E
