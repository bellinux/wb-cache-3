Methods/Design The VITA-D study, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study with two parallel groups including a total of 200 kidney transplant recipients, is designed to investigate the immunomodulatory and renoprotective effects of cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3) within the transplant setting.

The second step comprises the discontinuous cultivation of H. pluvialis in diluted filteredslurry. The optimal dilution was researched by testing undiluted and 2, 4 and 8 -fold diluted filtrate.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the microfiltration in a specifically designed membrane bioreactor operating under various transmembrane pressures with periodic backwashing was investigated for model media. These media were representative of some usual components of a fermentation medium: BSA solution (2 g L− 1), yeast suspension (8 g L− 1, dry mass) and a mixture of BSA/yeast (2 g L− 1 / 8 g L− 1). In this system, the separation was provided by a 0. 1 μm polysulfone hollow fiber membrane. The net permeate fluxes observed for yeast/BSA mixture were proportional to the transmembrane pressure applied (ΔP) but were less than those obtained with water osmosis, showing that, {{in spite of the}} periodic backwash, a small amount of irreversible fouling remained.

We pooled data on mean bias (difference between eGFR and mGFR) and on mean accuracy (proportion of eGFR within 30 % of mGFR) using a random-effects inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis. We included 48 studies of 26, 875 patients that reported data on bias and/or accuracy. Meta-analysis of within-study comparisons where both formulae were tested on the same patient cohorts using isotope dilution-mass spectrometry-traceable creatinine showed a lower mean bias in eGFR using CKD-EPI of 2. 2 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 (95 % CI 1. 1 to 3. 2; 30 studies; I 2 = 74. 4 %) and a higher mean accuracy of CKD-EPI of 2. 7 % (1. 6 to 3. 8; 47 studies; I 2 = 55. 5 %).

Five detention systems with different packing order arrangements of aggregates and plant roots were used in the system to test the effects of gravel, sand, ecosoil, block paving and turf on the water treatment performance.

Several parameters such as BOD 5, NO 3, PO 4, NH 4, SS, TS, DO, pH, EC, NTU and temperature were examined based on standard method book. Results showed that concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) in contrast to suspended solids (SS) were frequently reduced to below international secondary wastewater treatment standards. The BOD and SS concentrations within the outflow from the planted system compared to the unplanted gravel and sand systems were similar.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} kidney {{is organized}} into a cortex where <b>primary</b> <b>filtration</b> occurs, and a medullary region composed of elongated tubular epithelia where urine is concentrated. We {{show that the}} cortico-medullary axis of kidney organization and function is regulated by Wnt 7 b signaling. The future collecting duct network specifically expresses Wnt 7 b. In the absence of Wnt 7 b, cortical epithelial development is normal but the medullary zone fails to form and urine fails to be concentrated normally. The analysis of cell division planes in the collecting duct epithelium of the emerging medullary zone indicates a bias along the longitudinal axis of the epithelium. By contrast, in Wnt 7 b mutants, cell division planes in this population are biased along the radial axis, suggesting that Wnt 7 b-mediated regulation of the cell cleavage plane contributes {{to the establishment of}} a cortico-medullary axis. The removal of β-catenin from the underlying Wnt-responsive interstitium phenocopies the medullary deficiency of Wnt 7 b mutants, suggesting a paracrine role for Wnt 7 b action through the canonical Wnt pathway. Wnt 7 b signaling is also essential for the coordinated growth of the loop of Henle, a medullary extension of the nephron that elongates in parallel to the collecting duct epithelium.

The GFB had been thought to comprise 3 layers – the endothelium, the basement membrane and the podocyte foot processes. However, recent {{studies have suggested that}} at least two additional layers contribute to the function of the GFB, the endothelial glycocalyx on the vascular side, and the sub-podocyte space on the urinary side. To investigate the structure of these additional layers is difficult as it requires three-dimensional reconstruction of delicate sub-microscopic (< 1 μm) cellular and extracellular elements. Methods: Here we have combined three different advanced electron microscopic techniques that cover multiple orders of magnitude of volume sampled, with a novel staining methodology (Lanthanum Dysprosium Glycosaminoglycan adhesion, or LaDy GAGa), to determine the structural basis of these two additional layers. Serial Block Face Scanning Electron Microscopy (SBF-SEM) was used to generate a 3 -D image stack with a volume of a 5. 3 x 105 μm 3 volume of a whole kidney glomerulus (13 % of glomerular volume).

The conflicting requirements posed by efficient air transit {{on the one hand}} and sampling for olfaction on the other renders the geometry of the upper airways complex. Knowledge of the geometry and flow conditions are primary requirements for understanding the physiological mechanics of the airways. This work describes the application of imaging and experimental measurement techniques to determine the variations in nasal airway geometry and the characteristics of nasal inspiratory flow. Whilst the results are relevant to a host of applications, the particular case of sinonasal ventilation well illustrates the interrelation between form, flow and function as well as motivating the development of improved techniques for clinical management. Specifically 3 T MR imaging has been investigated as a means to define the anatomy in congested and decongested states. Results show very large changes in nasal airway calibre and moreover allow the variation in mucosal engorgement throughout the nasal cavity to be mapped. Highly time resolved hot wire measurements of inspiratory flow profiles revealed for the first time the rapid temporal development of inspiratory flow during normal inspiration and dramatically so during sniffing. Variations in flow profile were recorded across a cohort of subjects for conditions of normal inspiration, sniffing and smelling. Sinonasal gas exchange is of particular interest given the common occurrence of sinus pathologies.

Defect percentages were found to be in good agreement with those based on a local stokes number approach, an analytical model using a converging flow velocity profile. It was hypothesized that these defects occur by virtue of larger particles passing through the near wall flow region and consequently transported to the major flow. The trajectories of such defect occurrences clearly show that these particles originated in the near wall region. Performance at higher mass loadings was evaluated using a background dust matrix generated by a turntable aerosol generator. At high mass loadings, clogging of the slit led to the deterioration of the impactor's performance. The time taken to clog the silt was estimated by modeling the slit edge as a single filter fiber of rectangular cross section with the <b>primary</b> mechanism of <b>filtration</b> being interception and was found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. Elimination of defect transmission and clogging would be possible by the provision of a sheath airflow, which ensures that the near wall regions are free of particles...|$|R
40|$|Proteomics aims to link {{genes to}} protein {{expression}} and function. Proteomics {{is a very}} versatile and technology-dependent discipline {{and the development of}} mass spectrometry-based proteomics has advanced the understanding of the complex and dynamic nature of proteomes. Proteomics does not have a “one-size-fits-all” strategy to answer all biological questions. New technical approaches are needed to overcome the hurdles, e. g. issues related to complexity and dynamic ranges of the samples, high throughput and post-translational modifications, in the field of proteomics. Due to recent technological development, proteomics has become complementary to genomics and transcriptomics in systems biology and can provide unique contributions. In this thesis a novel microfluidic compact disc based system was tested in use of high throughput sample preparation of digested peptide samples prior to matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (Paper I). A novel microfluidic electrocapture technology able to immobilize charged biomolecules in an electric field along a hydrodynamic flow was further developed to establish its ability to separate peptides of protein digests (Paper III). The same technology was later also used in analysis of glomerular membrane proteins {{as a part of a}} two-dimensional fractionation system in combination with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (Paper IV). The kidney glomerulus functions as a specialized blood filter unit that forms the <b>primary</b> urine. The <b>filtration</b> barrier is composed of a three-layer barrier, which consists of endothelial cells, the glomerular basement membrane and the slit diaphragm between epithelial podocyte foot processes. The glomeruli are sensitive to damage and glomerular diseases underlie the majority of diseases leading to chronic kidney disease and renal failure. Even though the molecular composition of the glomerulus is quite well known, the pathomechanisms of glomerular diseases are still poorly unknown. The mouse glomerular proteome was now studied with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in combination with mass spectrometry (Paper II). Finally a meta-analysis of currently available proteomic and transcriptomic glomerular expression data in normal and disease states was performed to explore the usability of expression profiling in the diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of glomerular diseases (Paper V) ...|$|R
40|$|In climate {{research}} {{the interest on}} carbonaceous particles has increased {{over the last years}} because of their influence on the radiation balance of the earth. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of available data regarding their concentrations and sources in the past. Such data would be important for a better understanding of their effects and for estimating their influence on future climate. Here, a technique is described to extract carbonaceous particles from ice core samples with subsequent separation of the two main constituents into organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) for analysis of their concentrations in the past. This is combined with further analysis of OC and EC 14 C/ 12 C ratios by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), what can be used for source apportionment studies of past emissions. We further present how 14 C analysis of the OC fraction could be used in the future to date any ice core extracted from a high-elevation glacier. Described sample preparation steps to final analysis include the combustion of micrograms of water–insoluble carbonaceous particles, <b>primary</b> collected by <b>filtration</b> of melted ice samples, the graphitisation of the obtained CO 2 to solid AMS target material and final AMS measurements. Possible fractionation processes were investigated for quality assurance. Procedural blanks were reproducible and resulted in carbon masses of 1. 3 ± 0. 6 μg OC and 0. 3 ± 0. 1 μg EC per filter. The determined fraction of modern carbon (fM) for the OC blank was 0. 61 ± 0. 13. The analysis of processed IAEA-C 6 and IAEA-C 7 reference material resulted in fM = 1. 521 ± 0. 011 and δ 13 C = − 10. 85 ± 0. 19 ‰, and fM = 0. 505 ± 0. 011 and δ 13 C = − 14. 21 ± 0. 19 ‰, respectively, in agreement with consensus values. Initial carbon contents were thereby recovered with an average yield of 93 %...|$|R
