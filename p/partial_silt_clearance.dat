40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} noncompact (<b>partial)</b> <b>silting</b> and (<b>partial)</b> tilting sets and objects in any triangulated category D with arbitrary (set-indexed) coproducts. We show that equivalence classes of <b>partial</b> <b>silting</b> sets are in bijection with t-structures generated by their co-heart whose heart has a generator, and in case D is compactly generated, this bijection restricts to one between equivalence classes of self-small partially silting objects and left nondegenerate t-structures in D whose heart is a module category and whose associated cohomological functor preserves products. We describe the objects in the aisle of the t-structure associated to a <b>partial</b> <b>silting</b> set T as the Milnor (aka homotopy) colimit of sequences of morphisms with succesive cones in Sum(T) [n]. We use this fact to develop a theory of tilting objects in very general AB 3 abelian categories, a setting and its dual on which we show the validity of several well-known results of tilting and cotilting theory of modules. Finally, we show that if T is a bounded tilting set in a compactly generated algebraic triangulated category D and H {{is the heart of}} the associated t-structure, then the inclusion of H in D extends to a triangulated equivalence between the derived category D(H) of H and the ambient triangulated category D which restricts to bounded levels. Comment: We have modified Section 4 (previously Section 3) and added a final section connecting our work to exceptional sequence...|$|R
40|$|There are {{well-known}} constructions relating ring epimorphisms and tilting modules. The new {{notion of}} silting module provides a wider framework for studying this interplay. To every <b>partial</b> <b>silting</b> module we associate a ring epimorphism which we describe explicitly as an idempotent quotient of the endomorphism {{ring of the}} Bongartz completion. For hereditary rings, this assignment is used to parametrise homological ring epimorphisms by silting modules. We further show that homological ring epimorphisms of a hereditary ring form a lattice which completes the poset of noncrossing partitions {{in the case of}} finite dimensional algebras...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} the new concept of silting modules. These modules generalise tilting modules over an arbitrary ring, {{as well as}} support τ-tilting modules over a finite dimensional algebra recently introduced by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten. We show that silting modules generate torsion classes that provide left approximations, and that every <b>partial</b> <b>silting</b> module admits an analogue of the Bongartz complement. Furthermore, we prove that silting modules are in bijection with 2 -term silting complexes and with certain t-structures and co-t-structures in the derived module category. We also see how some of these bijections hold for silting complexes of arbitrary finite length...|$|R

The sediment taken at st. 6 and st. 11 from Jinzu River and Oyabe River appeared in brown color with <b>partial</b> <b>silt</b> and particle size measured less than 1.0  mm. The sediment from st. 12 that was located at domestic wastewater in Furu River discharge point appeared in dark color s, containing mostly of sand and partially of silt, with particle size of sediment less than 0.5  mm. It is assumed that smaller sediment particle size will give a wider surface area for the adsorption in every unit of particle weight. On the contrary, a smaller particle size of sediment would result in a higher D [...]...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} silting modules {{are closely related}} with {{localisation}}s of rings. More precisely, every <b>partial</b> <b>silting</b> module {{gives rise to a}} localisation at a set of maps between countably generated projective modules and, conversely, every universal localisation, in the sense of Cohn and Schofield, arises in this way. To establish these results, we further explore the finite-type classification of tilting classes and we use the morphism category to translate silting modules into tilting objects. In particular, we prove that silting modules are of finite type. Comment: 20 pages; version 2 : Subsection 6. 4 added with an example of a silting ring epimorphism which is not a universal localisation, small changes in presentation (e. g. Proposition 3. 3 now summarizes properties of set-generated cotorsion pairs), references added and update...|$|R
50|$|The commune {{is located}} in the heart of a region of {{limestone}} hills overlooking the Gironde estuary. The Littoral zone extends from the Bay of Chant-Dorat, west of the commune, to the Monards Channel in the south, consists essentially of an alternation of muddy intertidal zones and Limestone cliffs which are relatively eroded and are termed dead zones {{in the southern part of}} the commune. This term is explained by the gradual retreat of the shoreline and the <b>partial</b> <b>silting</b> of the estuary at this point leaving the cliffs, once battered by the waves, several hundred metres from the waters of the estuary, in the middle of the swampy areas. This type of landscape, found mostly near Mortagne-sur-Gironde, marks the beginning of what is sometimes called the Charente Camargue. In the north-west the Caillaud cliffs mark the border with the commune of Talmont-sur-Gironde.|$|R
40|$|Water {{rather than}} land is the {{limiting}} factor for crop production in Sudan. This study attempts {{to use the}} water footprint (WFP) and virtual water concepts to account for crops water consumption under the Sudanese rainfed and irrigated conditions. The general average of the green WFP of sorghum and millet {{were found to be}} about 7700 and 10700 m 3 ton- 1, respectively. According to experimental results at three different climates, in-situ rainwater harvesting techniques could reduce the WFP of rainfed sorghum by 56 % on the average. The blue component (surface water) shows the highest contribution to the total WFP of irrigated crops: 88 % for cotton, 70 % for sorghum, 68 % for groundnut and 100 % for wheat. However, the role of the green water (rainwater) is not marginal since it largely influences the operation and maintenance (<b>silt</b> <b>clearance)</b> of the gravity-fed irrigation system. Under normal conditions, the annual total virtual water demand of sorghum (the dominant food crop in Sudan) is found to be 15 km 3, of which 91 % is green water. During a dry year, however, Sudan could experience a deficit of 2. 3 km 3 of water, necessitating the adoption of a wise food stocking-exporting policy...|$|R
50|$|Its {{abandonment}} {{dates from}} the <b>partial</b> <b>silting</b> up of the right arm of the Tiber in the Middle Ages, which restored to Ostia what little traffic was left. To {{the west of the}} harbour is the cathedral of Saint Rufina (10th century, but modernized except for the campanile) and the episcopal palace, fortified in the Middle Ages, and containing a number of ancient inscriptions from the site. On the island (Isola Sacra) just opposite is the church of S. Ippolito, built on the site of a Roman building, with a picturesque medieval campanile (13th century ?), as well as the Isola Sacra Necropolis; 3.2 km to the west is the modern village of Fiumicino {{at the mouth of the}} right arm of the Tiber, which is 34 km westsouthwest by rail from Rome. It is a frazione, or portion of the commune of Rome. 5 km to the north is the pumping station by which the lowland (formerly called Stagno di Maccarese, now reclaimed and traversed by many drainage canals) between there and Maccarese is kept drained (Bonifica di Maccarese).|$|R
50|$|The channel which crosses Town Moor was {{enlarged}} in the 1960s {{as part of}} {{the then}} flood defence system, long before the Jubilee River was built. The two channels rejoin at Green Lane and from there the waterway running down to the Thames is 45 to 50 ft wide, but overgrown and partly <b>silted</b> up. Channel <b>clearance</b> work {{over the last few years}} by volunteers and the Environment Agency has removed most of the tree blockages and it is already usable by canoes and rowing boats.|$|R
40|$|It is {{recognized}} that sedimentation is a main factor influencing a fish way {{whether it is}} freely flowing. In this study, two experiments, scour experiment and sedimentation experiment, are utilized on the U-turn horizontal section of fishway to examine causes which lead to sedimentation situation. Through scour experiment,the <b>silt</b> <b>clearance</b> capacity of clear-water discharge revealed on U-turn horizontal section of fish way is explored. On the other hand, while proceeding sedimentation experiment some elements are conducted such as changing slop, discharge, sand added particle and setting T-bone structure, etc. Adding sand following by a period time, we inspect how sand particle affects sedimentation furthering to see whether fish way is blocked accordingly. By analyzing experiment data, it is to know {{as long as the}} sand is smaller (19. 05 mm mixed particle under), the sedimentation could be divided into three types. Under different discharges and slops, all those three types of sedimentation could achieve a balance of sand added and collected. That means although there is sedimentation however the fish way is not unlikely to be blocked. On the contrary, while there is bigger sand(50. 80 mm mixed particle under) the fish way is blocked owing to upstream sedimentation or sediment deposit in U-turn horizontal section. Once there is sedimentation occurred at the U-T-turn horizontal section of fish way, it is difficult to clean away by clear-water discharge. For the reason, setting T-bone structure along with regular management and maintenance could decrease sedimentation. These findings are expected as reference in fish way design of engineering practice. 砂石進入魚道後的淤砂情形是影響魚道是否暢通的主要原因。本研究主要針對魚道水平迴頭彎段，進行兩種不同起始條件之沖刷試驗與淤砂試驗，利用沖刷試驗了解清水流對魚道水平迴頭彎段淤砂之清除能力；利用淤砂試驗，以改變坡度、流量、加砂粒徑及有無設置丁骨構造物等情況下，對魚道水平迴頭彎段淤積情形之影響，並觀察是否會有阻塞魚道之現象。 經由試驗資料分析，當加砂粒徑較小(19. 05 mm混合粒徑級配) 時，能將其淤砂情形分為三種淤砂型態，其在各種流量與坡度下，均能達到加砂、收砂平衡，雖有淤砂產生但不至於阻塞魚道；當採用較大加砂粒徑(50. 80 mm混合粒徑級配) ，魚道發生傾斜段淤積或水平迴頭彎段回淤，使魚道阻塞；魚道水平迴頭彎段一旦發生淤砂現象，難以清水流清除淤砂，可搭配設置丁骨構造物並配合人工管理維護定時清淤，希望此研究能對將來在魚道之內部設計方面有所幫助。第一章 前言	 1 第二章 前人研究	 3 2. 1 有關防砂壩對河川生態的影響及魚道效用之評估	 3 2. 2 有關魚道設計之研究	 4 2. 3 台灣魚類溯游特性之研究	 10 2. 4 有關丁壩設計之研究	 11 第三章 理論分析	 16 3. 1 消能方式	 16 3. 2 福祿數與水躍現象	 17 3. 2 砂丘(Sand Dunes) 	 17 3. 3 丁壩(Spur Dikes) 	 18 第四章 渠槽試驗	 20 4. 1 試驗目的	 20 4. 2 試驗設備	 21 4. 3 試驗設計條件及步驟	 29 第五章 結果與討論	 36 5. 1 福祿數之結果與討論	 36 5. 2 沖刷試驗結果與討論	 38 5. 3 淤砂試驗-不同加砂粒徑之加砂、收砂情形探討	 39 5. 4 淤砂試驗-魚道水平迴頭彎段之淤砂量探討	 44 5. 5 淤砂試驗-魚道水平迴頭彎段之淤砂型態與淤砂厚度探討	 48 第六章 結論與建議	 56 6. 1 結論		 56 6. 2 建議		 58 參考文獻	 59 附表、淤砂試驗時段加砂、收砂量表	 61 附圖、淤砂試驗淤砂型態等厚度線及立體圖	 6...|$|R
