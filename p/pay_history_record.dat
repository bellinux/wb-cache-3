Each borrowing <b>history</b> <b>record</b> contains a reader ever borrowed books and the reader’s the degrees of interest for those books. We let one reader as the target of mining, and use association rules to find the personalized book recommendations for the reader from two aspects, respectively. First, we only consider the books whether they are contained in borrowing <b>history</b> <b>records</b> or not, and propose a method to mine association rules whose antecedents are contained in the reader’s borrowing <b>history</b> <b>record.</b> According to thecharacteristics of the association rules, we can find the adaptive book recommendations for the reader. Moreover, we consider the books with readers’ interests in the borrowing <b>history</b> <b>records,</b> and proposeanother method to mine association rules with interesting degrees whose antecedents are contained in the reader’s borrowing <b>history</b> <b>record.</b> According to {{the characteristics of the}} association rules with interesting degrees, we can find the reader’s the adaptive book recommendations for considering his interests. The results of the mining can provide very useful information to find personalized book recommendation for library. [Article content in Chinese...|$|R
