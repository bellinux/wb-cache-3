40|$|Enterprise {{resource}} {{planning systems}} and computerised maintenance management systems {{are commonly used}} by organisations for handling of maintenance work orders through a graphical user interface. A work order consists {{of a number of}} data fields, such as drop-down lists, list boxes, check boxes and text <b>entry</b> <b>fields.</b> In contrast to the other data fields, the operator has the freedom to type in any text in the text <b>entry</b> <b>fields,</b> to complement and make the work order description complete. Accordingly, the text <b>entry</b> <b>fields</b> of work orders can contain any words, in any number, as necessary. Data quality is crucial in statistical analysis of work orders data, and therefore manual analysis of work orders’ text <b>entry</b> <b>fields</b> is often necessary before any decision making. However, this may be a very tedious and resource consuming process. In this article, we apply computerised analysis of text <b>entry</b> <b>fields</b> of work orders data, to study if it can bring further value in the assessment of technical assets’ performance.

Second, the price to beat would have to be reasonably low, to enable as many customers as possible to continue to consume electricity during the transition period.|$|R
