[...] In addition, each faculty {{has its own}} student representative body. There are more than 300 student organizations and clubs, covering {{a wide range of}} interests such as academics, culture, religion, social issues, and recreation. Many of them are centred on the McMaster student activity centre, the McMaster University Student Centre. The Silhouette, the student-run newspaper, is the oldest student service at McMaster University, in publication since 1929. Since 1968, the McMaster Engineering Society has published The <b>Plumbline,</b> the main satire magazine of McMaster University. The campus radio station CFMU-FM (93.3 FM) is Canada’s second-oldest campus radio station, and has been broadcasting since 1978. MacInsiders, a popular online student-run forum and information network, has been operating since 2007 and has over 18,000 registered members. The McMaster Marching Band, created in September 2009, is a brass, reed and percussion marching band composed of 45 graduate and undergraduate students as well as members of the surrounding community who wish to participate.|$|E

Without proper management of quality requirements, there is an increased risk that the software product under development will not meet the expectations of its future users. In this paper, we share experiences from testing quality requirements when developing a large system-of-systems {{in the public sector}} in Sweden. We complement the experience reporting by analyzing documents from the case under study. As a final step, we match the identified challenges with solution proposals from the literature. We report five main challenges covering inadequate requirements engineering and disconnected test managers. Finally, we match the challenges to solutions proposed in the scientific literature, including integrated requirements engineering, the twin peaks model, virtual <b>plumblines,</b> the QUPER model, and architecturally significant requirements. Our experiences are valuable to other large development projects struggling with testing of quality requirements. Furthermore, the report could be used by as input to process improvement activities in the case under study.

40|$|Nowadays it is {{possible}} to measure accurately dense point clouds either with aerial/terrestrial laser scanning systems or with imagebased solutions (namely based on photogrammetric computer vision algorithms such as structure-from-motion (SfM)), from which highly detailed 3 D models can be achieved. Besides, direct tools in the form of simple devices such as rulers, compass and <b>plumblines</b> are usually required in simple metric surveys, as well as high-end surveying and geodetic instruments such as robotized imagebased total stations and GNSS (probably to a lesser degree but still required) to set the archaeological/architectural recording project in a global reference frame. With all this gamut of image-based and range-based sensors and datasets (in the form of coordinates, point clouds or 3 D models), in different coordinate systems (most of the times local for each device), lack of uniform scale, orientation and levelling, the fusion of data tends to be cumbersome. This paper presents an efficient way to fuse and merge different datasets in the form of point clouds/ 3 D models and geodetic/UTM coordinates. The new developed 3 DVEM – Register GEO software is able to handle datasets coming from both direct and indirect methods in order to provide unified and precise deliverables...|$|R

50|$|The Plumblinehttp://macengsociety.ca/{{publication}}s/the-plumbline/ is a humor {{publication of}} the McMaster Engineering Society (MES) of McMaster University. Popular among the students of McMaster Engineering, The <b>Plumbline</b> is famous for publishing everything from obscene sexual innuendos to informative articles. The <b>Plumbline</b> was started {{by a group of}} Engineering students in 1967, developed from a single sheet MES news letter. In 1971, the editors decided to turn the newsletter into an 8-page tabloid format newspaper.|$|E

50|$|Geographical {{latitude}} and longitude are stated in the units degree, minute of arc, and second of arc. They are angles, not metricmeasures, and describe {{the direction of the}} local normal to the reference ellipsoid of revolution. This is approximately the same as the direction of the <b>plumbline,</b> i.e., local gravity, which is also the normal to the geoid surface. For this reason, astronomical position determination - measuring the direction of the <b>plumbline</b> by astronomical means - works fairly well provided an ellipsoidal model of the figure of the Earth is used.|$|E

50|$|The {{centroid}} of {{a uniform}} planar lamina, such as (a) below, may be determined, experimentally, {{by using a}} <b>plumbline</b> and a pin to find the center of mass of a thin body of uniform density having the same shape. The body is held by the pin inserted at a point near the body's perimeter, {{in such a way}} that it can freely rotate around the pin; and the plumb line is dropped from the pin (b). The position of the <b>plumbline</b> is traced on the body. The experiment is repeated with the pin inserted at a different point of the object. The intersection of the two lines is the centroid of the figure (c).|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, {{it was clear}} that student and {{administration}} acceptance of sexist and xenophobic content was reduced. In this climate, The <b>Plumbline</b> reformatted, dropping the drooping penis from its masthead, developing the satirical and parody genres of humor and abandoning misogyny as fodder for comedy.|$|E
5000|$|In late 2005, {{publication}} of The <b>Plumbline</b> was temporarily suspended because of allegations from the McMaster Coalition for Equitable Social Change {{that the paper}} promoted hate-speech and sexist attitudes. The Coalition saw the newspaper as {{a key element in}} a larger problem of intolerance within the faculty of Engineering. They argued that this is evident in many of the faculty's traditions and [...] "welcome" [...] practices for first year students. According to them, the newspaper legitimized this culture of intolerance. On the other hand, advocates of The <b>Plumbline</b> argued that the depictions were wholly satirical in nature and protected under free speech. Some argue that the opposition was a form of moral panic in response to the rape of a McMaster student within the Engineering faculty and the efforts to minimize the rape and subsequent conviction of Engineering student for the crime.|$|E
50|$|After a {{brief period}} of debates and {{arguments}} including review by the Executive of the McMaster Engineering Society, the Dean of Engineering, and the Human Rights Office, The <b>Plumbline</b> returned to shelves.

50|$|In the 2-dimension case, as {{mentioned}} already, the usual designation of the vertical {{coincides with the}} y-axis in co-ordinate geometry.

5000|$|The normal height [...] of a {{point is}} {{computed}} from geopotential numbers by dividing the point's geopotential number, i.e. its geopotential difference with that of sea level, by the average, normal gravity computed along the <b>plumbline</b> of the point. (More precisely, along the ellipsoidal normal, averaging over the height range from 0 — the ellipsoid — to the procedure is thus recursive.|$|E
50|$|Some in the McMaster Engineering {{community}} {{feel that}} the <b>Plumbline</b> is unfairly targeted by {{the remainder of the}} campus for its controversial content and potentially offensive subject matter, and that it is subjected to a harsher, more restrictive standard than other on-campus events (such as the misogynistic lyrics of Choclair who performed on campus) and publications organized by other groups (like the campus wide newspaper The Silhouette).|$|E
5000|$|Normal heights {{are thus}} {{dependent}} upon the reference ellipsoid chosen. The Soviet Union and many other Eastern European countries have chosen a height system based on normal heights, determined by geodetic precise levelling. Normal gravity values are easy to compute and [...] "hypothesis-free", i.e., {{one does not have}} to know, as one would for computing orthometric heights, the density of the Earth's crust around the <b>plumbline.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Throughout the 1980s McCreary {{continued}} to establish {{himself as an}} industry leader and innovator by scouting, developing and producing unknown new artists. It’s during this era that McCreary is credited with pitching the highly circulated hymnal “Yes Lord” to leaders of the Church of God in Christ organization. [...] McCreary also began work at a new label in the early '80s—Benson Records. [...] There, he held the title International Director of Radio Promotions, before Benson granted him a solo label called Onyx International Records. [...] New artists such as Richard Smallwood, Vanessa Bell Armstrong, Thomas Whitfield, The New York City Family, Danniebelle Hall and Bishop Paul S. Morton signed on with Onyx. In conjunction with the newly signed artists, Onyx released Mel Carter's album entitled Willing that earned a Dove Nomination. By the mid 80's, McCreary had accepted a position at <b>Plumbline</b> Records as the Vice President of A&R. While at <b>Plumbline,</b> he signed new artists such as Daryl Coley, LeCresia Campbell, and Rickey Grundy. It was during this time that he presented talent at Midem, the International Music Market in Cannes, France.|$|E
50|$|Corresponding to {{this new}} height concept {{is the concept of}} the telluroid, the {{collection}} of points Q the normal potential of which is equal to the true potential of a point P on the terrain, and on the same <b>plumbline.</b> The separation between points P and Q, i.e., between topographic and telluroid surfaces, is called the height anomaly, and is, contrary to the geoid undulation N, defined throughout space, not only at sea level.|$|E

50|$|His main work (since 1932) was on {{the figure}} of the Earth (the geoid) and her {{exterior}} gravity field or geopotential. His aim was to develop hypothesis-free methods for determining both the gravity field and defining vertical reference systems for large areas. As part of this work, he introduced normal heights, which can be calculated from geopotential numbers (obtained from precise levelling) without needing the uncertain value of gravity along the <b>plumbline</b> of a point, i.e., inside the continental crustal rock under the point.|$|E
