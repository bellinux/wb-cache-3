50|$|Relatedly, gambler's ruin {{shows that}} a <b>player</b> <b>with</b> finite {{resources}} continuously playing will inevitably go broke against a <b>player</b> <b>with</b> infinite resources in a fair or negative-expectation game.

40|$|A power {{measure is}} {{monotone}} if a <b>player</b> <b>with</b> a larger weight is assigned {{at least as}} much power as a <b>player</b> <b>with</b> a smaller weight in the same weighted majority game. Failure of a power index to satisfy monotonicity is often considered a pathological feature. In this paper, we show that monotonicity may fail in the unique subgame perfect equilibrium of a noncooperative bargaining game. A <b>player</b> <b>with</b> a smaller weight may have a higher expected payoff than a <b>player</b> <b>with</b> a larger weight. This is possible even though coalition formation and payoff division are endogenous, all players are rational and there is no asymmetry between the players other than in the weights...|$|R

The <b>player</b> <b>with</b> the ace chooses where to sit first, etc. First dealer is the <b>player</b> <b>with</b> the king.|$|R
