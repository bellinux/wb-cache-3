5000|$|NMR {{spectroscopy}} {{is often}} the method of choice for monitoring reaction progress, where substrate consumption and/or product formation may be observed over time from the change of <b>peak</b> <b>integration</b> relative to a non-reactive standard. From the concentration data, the rate of reaction over time may be obtained by taking the derivative of a polynomial fit to the experimental curve. Reaction progress NMR may be classified as an integral technique as the primary data collected are proportional to concentration vs. time. While this technique is extremely convenient for clearly defined systems with distinctive, isolated product and/or reactant peaks, it has the drawback of requiring a homogenous system amenable to reaction in an NMR tube. While NMR observation may allow for the identification of a reaction intermediates, the presence of any given species {{over the course of}} the reaction does not necessarily implicate it in a productive process. Reaction progress NMR may, however, often be run at variable temperature, allowing the rate of reaction to be adjusted to a level convenient for observation. Examples of utilization of reaction progress NMR abound, with notable examples including investigation of Buchwald-Hartwig amination (One might note that considerable debate surrounded the best approach to mechanistic development of the Buchwald-Hartwig amination as indicated by a number of contradictory and competing reports published over a short period of time.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the value of information from both magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to automated discrimination of brain tumours. The influence of imaging intensities and metabolic data was tested by comparing the use of MR spectra from MRSI, MR imaging intensities, <b>peak</b> <b>integration</b> values obtained from the MR spectra and {{a combination of the}} latter two. Three classification techniques were objectively compared: linear discriminant analysis, least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) with a linear kernel as linear techniques and LS-SVM with radial basis function kernel as a nonlinear technique. Classifiers were evaluated over 100 stratified random splittings of the dataset into training and test sets. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used as a global performance measure on test data. In general, all techniques obtained a high performance when using <b>peak</b> <b>integration</b> values with or without MR imaging intensities. For example for low- versus high-grade tumours, low- versus high-grade gliomas and gliomas versus meningiomas, the mean test AUC was higher than 0. 91, 0. 94, and 0. 99, respectively, when both MR imaging intensities and <b>peak</b> <b>integration</b> values were used.

One of the analysis is performed by the Lunar Advanced Volatiles Analysis (LAVA) subsystem, which consists of a fluid network that facilitates the transport of volatile samples to a gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer (GC-MS) instrument. The understanding of fluid dynamics directed from the GC to the MS is important due {{to the influence of}} flow rates and pressures that affect the accuracy of and prevent the damage to the overall GC-MS instrument. The micro-scale capillary fluid network within the GC alone has various lengths and inner-diameters; therefore, determination of pressure differentials and flow rates are difficult to model computationally, with additional complexity from the vacuum conditions in space and lack of a lunar atmosphere. A series of tests were performed on an experimental set-up of the system where the inner diameters of the GC transfer line connecting to the MS were varied. The effect on chromatography readings were also studied by applying these lines onto a GC instrument. It was found that a smaller inner diameter transfer line resulted in a lower flow rate, as well as a lower pressure differential across the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) unit of the GC and a negligible pressure drop across the mock-up capillary column.

30|$|Though it is {{possible}} to run MVA on every mass channel of a ToF-SIMS spectrum, it is more common for users to export a set of selected peak areas from the spectrum. This is a logical choice since ToF-SIMS spectra contain many mass channels that contain only noise, or no counts, due to the low background between peaks. Since the set of peaks used in MVA can affect the results, peak selection becomes the first data preprocessing step before one can run MVA. Peak selection can be done by binning the data into chosen interval sizes, using automated peak detection routines, or by manually choosing and measuring peak areas. Due to the large number of peaks typically seen at each nominal mass in ToF-SIMS spectra from organic and biological surfaces, manual peak selection is recommended. Data binning is quick, but it loses the high mass resolution information present in the original spectra. If data binning is used, one must go back to the original data to determine which peaks are changing at a given mass to properly interpret the MVA results. Automated peak selection routines are getting better, but they often misplace <b>peak</b> <b>integration</b> limits, which can be problematic when working with spectra with overlapping peaks. Manual peak selection is time consuming, but allows the user to utilize all of the spectral peaks and to check the <b>peak</b> <b>integration</b> limits to assure they are placed properly across all samples. The assumptions made when selecting peaks for ToF-SIMS MVA have been reviewed previously [33].|$|E
