Spatial pooling, by grouping of local codes, equips these methods with a certain degree of robustness to translation and deformation yet preserving important spatial information.

40|$|Mobile sinks {{are vital}} in many {{wireless}} sensor applications for efficient data collection, data querying, and localized sensor reprogramming. Mobile sinks prolong {{the lifetime of}} a sensor network. However, when sensor networks with mobile sinks are deployed in a hostile environment, security became a critical issue. They become exposed to varieties of malicious attacks. Thus, anti threats schemes and security services, such as mobile sink?s authentication and pairwise key establishment, are essential components for the secure operation of such networks. Due to the sensors, limited resources designing efficient security schemes with low communication overhead to secure communication links between sensors and MS (Mobile Sink) is not a trivial task. In addition to the sensors limited resources, sink mobility required frequent exchange of cryptography information between the sensors and MS each time the MS updates its location which imposes extra communication overhead on the sensors. In this dissertation, we consider a number of security schemes for WSN (wireless sensor network) with MS. The schemes offer high network?s resiliency and low communication overhead against nodes capture, MS replication and wormhole attacks. We propose two schemes based on the polynomial <b>pool</b> <b>scheme</b> for tolerating nodes capture: the probabilistic generation key pre-distribution scheme combined with polynomial <b>pool</b> <b>scheme,</b> and the Q-composite generation key scheme combined with polynomial <b>pool</b> <b>scheme.</b> The schemes ensure low communication overhead and high resiliency. For anti MS replication attack scheme, we propose the multiple polynomial <b>pools</b> <b>scheme</b> that provide much higher resiliency to MS replication attack {{as compared to the}} single polynomial pool approach. Furthermore, to improve the network resiliency against wormhole attack, two defensive mechanisms were developed according to the MS mobility type. In the first technique, MS uses controlled mobility. We investigate the problem of using a single authentication code by sensors network to verify the source of MS beacons, and then we develop a defensive approach that divide the sensor network into different authentication code?s grids. In the second technique, random mobility is used by MS.

40|$|In this paper, we {{implement}} the region-of-influence (ROI) approach for modelling probabilities of heavy 1 -day and 5 -day precipitation amounts in the Czech Republic. The pooling groups are constructed according to (i) the regional homogeneity criterion (assessed by a built-in regional homogeneity test), which requires {{that in a}} pooling group the distributions of extremes are identical after scaling by the at-site mean; and (ii) the 5 T rule, which sets the minimum number of stations {{to be included in}} a pooling group for estimation of a quantile corresponding to return period T. The similarity of sites is evaluated in terms of climatological and geographical site characteristics. We carry out a series of sensitivity analyses by means of Monte Carlo simulations in order to explore the importance of the individual site attributes, including hybrid <b>pooling</b> <b>schemes</b> that combine both types of the site attributes with different relative weights. We conclude that in a dense network of precipitation stations in the Czech Republic (on average 1 station in a square of about 20 &times; 20 km), the actual distance between the sites plays the most important role in determining the similarity of probability distributions of heavy precipitation. There are, however, differences between the optimum <b>pooling</b> <b>schemes</b> depending on the duration of the precipitation events. While in the case of 1 -day precipitation amounts the <b>pooling</b> <b>scheme</b> based on the geographical proximity of sites outperforms all hybrid schemes, for multi-day amounts the inclusion of climatological site characteristics (although with much lower weights compared to the geographical distance) enhances the performance of the <b>pooling</b> <b>schemes.</b> This finding is in agreement with the climatological expectation since multi-day heavy precipitation events are more closely linked to some typical precipitation patterns over central Europe (related e. g. to the varied roles of Atlantic and Mediterranean influences) while the dependence of 1 -day extremes on climatological characteristics such as mean annual precipitation is much weaker. The findings of the paper show a promising perspective for an application of the ROI methodology in evaluating outputs of regional climate models with high resolution: the <b>pooling</b> <b>schemes</b> might serve for defining weighting functions, and the large spatial variability in the grid-box estimates of high quantiles of precipitation amounts may efficiently be reduced...|$|R

40|$|Pooling {{techniques}} commonly {{are used}} to increase the throughput of samples used for screening purposes. While the advantages of such techniques are increased analytical efficiency and cost savings, the sensitivity of measurements decreases because it is inversely proportional {{to the number of}} samples in the pools. Consequently, uncertainties in estimates of dose and risk which are {{based on the results of}} pooled samples increase as the number of samples in the pools increases in all applications. However, sensitivities may not be seriously degraded, for example, in urinalysis, if the samples in the pools are of known time duration, or if the fraction of some attribute of the grab urine samples to that in a 24 -hour composite is known (e. g., mass, specific gravity, creatinine, or volume, per 24 -h interval). This paper presents square and cube <b>pooling</b> <b>schemes</b> that greatly increase throughput and can considerably reduce analytical costs (on a sample basis). The benefit-cost ratios for 5 {times} 5 square and 5 {times} 5 {times} 5 cube <b>pooling</b> <b>schemes</b> are 2. 5 and 8. 3, respectively. Three-dimensional and higher arrayed <b>pooling</b> <b>schemes</b> would result in even greater economies; however, significant improvements in analytical sensitivity are required to achieve these advantages. These are various other considerations for designing a <b>pooling</b> <b>scheme,</b> where the number of dimensions and of samples in the optimum array are influenced by: (1) the minimal detectable amount (MDA) of the analytical processes, (2) the screening dose-rate requirements, (3) the maximum masses or volumes of the composite samples that can be analyzed, (4) the information already available from results of composite analysis, and (5) the ability of an analytical system to guard against both false negative and false positive results.

40|$|International audienceThe paper compares {{different}} approaches to regional frequency analysis with the main focus on {{the implementation of the}} region-of-influence (ROI) technique for the modelling of probabilities of heavy precipitation amounts {{in the area of the}} Western Carpathians. Unlike the conventional regional frequency analysis where the at-site design values are estimated within a fixed pooling group (region), the ROI approach as a specific alternative to focused pooling techniques makes use of flexible pooling groups, i. e. each target site has its own group of sufficiently similar sites. In this paper, various ROI <b>pooling</b> <b>schemes</b> are constructed as combinations of different alternatives of sites' similarity (pooling groups defined according to climatological characteristics and geographical proximity of sites, respectively) and pooled weighting factors.

30|$|This {{difference}} in the way pooling among time or frequency affects performance has no obvious justification, but we can consider intuitively why pooling as performed in image processing does not work as expected with acoustic spectrograms. In fact, as CNNs were widely adopted first in image processing, pooling is a function that makes much more sense in that domain. Downsampling an image would still maintain the overall shape of the object to be recognized, whereas this is hard to imagine happening in acoustic spectrograms. While this is not in the scope of this work, CNNs for acoustic signal processing might require a pooling function of their own. To illustrate this, imagine downsampling a black-and-white image of a circle or a square. Since the edges of this figure are adjacent, traditional <b>pooling</b> <b>schemes</b> make sense. However, with a note in a phone ringtone as seen in Fig. 2, this does not stand. Harmonic sounds have very specific rules in the spectrum domain, while they are still continuous in the traditional sense in time. In fact, this is exactly what the results show. Traditional pooling in frequency has negative effects as the pooling rules in acoustic spectrograms and in images are different. This opens the door for future investigations of more appropriate <b>pooling</b> <b>schemes</b> for acoustic spectrograms.|$|R
40|$|Most popular deep {{learning}} based models for action recognition {{are designed to}} generate separate predictions within their short temporal windows, which are often aggregated by heuristic means to assign an action label to the full video segment.

In an attempt towards tackling this challenge, we propose a novel <b>pooling</b> <b>scheme,</b> dubbed SVM <b>pooling,</b> based {{on the notion that}} among the bag of features generated by a CNN on all temporal windows, {{there is at least one}} feature that characterizes the action. To this end, we learn a decision hyperplane that separates this unknown yet useful feature from the rest.

Since these parameters are directly related to the support vectors in a max-margin framework, they serve as robust representations for pooling of the CNN features. We devise a joint optimization objective and an efficient solver that learns these hyperplanes per video and the corresponding action classifiers over the hyperplanes.
