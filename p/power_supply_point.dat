40|$|We propose {{employing}} nodal factor pricing, {{a method}} as-sociated with allocating losses at EHV transmission lev-els, for {{the allocation of}} loss costs at the distribution level. This method differs from traditional methods of averag-ing losses across customers regardless of location, time of use, or the marginal contribution of net power injec-tion/withdrawal positions to losses. With respect to dis-tributed generation (DG) resources, nodal prices provide more efficient price signals for dispatch and siting deci-sions. Moreover, nodal prices provide greater economic incentives for the deployment of DG by rewarding DG re-sources for contributions toward reducing losses at the mar-gin through changed power flows. Nodal pricing factors are calculated using power flows locating “the reference bus” at the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>point</b> where the transmission network connects to the distribution network.

40|$|Abstract — The {{presence}} of distributed generation (DG) {{resources in the}} network alters the power flows and the magnitude of network losses at both the transmission and distribution levels. Consequently the method used for the allocation {{of the cost of}} losses will necessarily have financial impacts on all parties connected to the network. In many regulatory schemes at the distribution level, the method used consists simply in averaging loss costs among all customers. Thus, no consideration is given for individual customers based on their location, especially those who install DG, which may reduce the amount of losses in the network. Thus, the averaging of losses across all customers creates a potential competitive disadvantage to the installation of DG in these market/regulatory environments. In this paper a method for allocation of loss costs at the distribution level of the network is proposed. The method is based on nodal factor pricing that is often employed at the transmission level of electric networks and determines the prices at different nodes in the distribution network using nodal factors that are calculated {{in the same manner as}} for the transmission network. These prices are economically efficient in the short run and allocate the cost of losses between the market participants connected in the distribution network based on location. Moreover, the nodal prices at the distribution level provide a more effective price signal with respect to the siting of DG resources. Nodal factors are calculated using power flows locating “the reference bus ” at the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>point</b> where the transmission network connects to the distribution network. An application of this method in a rural radial distribution network is also presented. Index Terms — Distributed generation, allocation of loss costs, distribution networks. I...|$|E

40|$|The NSLS II linac {{will produce}} a bunch train, 80 - 150 bunches long with 2 ns bunch spacing. Having the ability to tailor the bunch train {{can lead to the}} smaller bunch to bunch charge {{variation}} in the storage ring. A stripline is planned to integrate into the linac baseline to achieve this tailoring. The stripline must have a fast field rise and fall time to tailor each bunch. The beam dynamics is minimally affected by including the extra space for the stripline. This paper discusses the linac beam dynamics with stripline, and the optimal design of the stripline. A stripline is to be integrated in the linac to match the storage ring uniform bunch charge requirement, which simplifies the gun pulser electronics and looses the edge uniform requirement. It is located at low energy to lower the stripline <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> requirement and limit the dumped electron radiation. By turning off the stripline, the beam dynamics through linac is comparable with the baseline design. More advanced ideas can be explored. If a DC corrector along with the stripline is used, the core bunch trains gets kick from the stripline while the head and the tail of bunch train just gets a DC kick.
