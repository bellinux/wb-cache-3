50|$|Named {{after the}} first {{chairman}} and CEO, the Charles K. Vaughn Center is a technical training facility designed for new technicians and veterans who must be certified and recertified on a regular basis. Located in Plano, TX, the most visible aspect of the Vaughn Center is Gas City, an area designed to enable employees to practice and enhance their professional and safety skills. The area was built to resemble a simulated community with houses, mini-apartments, commercial buildings along with city streets having natural gas infrastructure, and a short gas transmission pipeline with <b>pig</b> <b>launchers.</b>|$|E
50|$|In February 2007 BP {{officials}} {{said that they were}} still working to determine the root cause of the leaks. At that time the investigation findings included water in the system, sediment buildup in the lines, and bacteria. Slow velocity in the lines was also an issue as the lines had been designed for much greater flow rates as were present when the wells were first opened. BP also announced a planned maintenance-repair budget for the Greater Prudhoe Bay area of $195 million for 2007, roughly four times what was spent in 2004. They said they had plans to replace 16 miles/26 km of transit lines with a new system designed to eliminate {{some of the problems that}} contributed to corrosion, such as caribou crossings that cause dips in the line. They also announced plans to change the environment in the pipes with continuous corrosion inhibitor added directly to the transit lines and with water or sediment buildup addressed with weekly maintenance pig runs; a new leak detection system; and new <b>pig</b> <b>launchers</b> and receivers in all segments of the transit lines, giving BP the capability to regularly run maintenance and smart pigs in all segments of the transit lines. Two segments of the transit system were scheduled to be replaced in 2007 and two in the winter of 2008, with a goal to have the entire module work completed by the end of 2008.|$|E

500|$|The {{most common}} pig is the scraper pig, which removes wax that {{precipitates}} {{out of the}} oil and collects {{on the walls of}} the pipeline. The colder the oil, the more wax buildup.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{statistical analysis of}} past accidents occurred between 1983 - 2013 reported to European Major Accidental Reporting System (EMARS) across seven industries for Human and Organizational Factor (HOF) assessment. The main purpose of this analysis is to provide guidelines for the HOF analysis and its quantification in chemical process industries. Five identified organizational factors have been chosen as performance shaping factors for human actions/interventions which are quantified using analysis of past accidents. The relation between organizational and human factors is developed and quantified using a newly developed methodology MEDIA. A case study is carried out for a <b>pig</b> <b>launcher</b> that is widely used in oil and gas facilities during pigging operations. Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) approach is used to identify the potentially critical human actions/ interventions based on guided brainstorming. After that, these identified actions/interventions analyzed using conventional FMECA approach and MEDIA. FMECA can provides a qualitative results, while MEDIA can provides quantitative results and also demonstrates the influence of an organization on human reliability. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Grou...|$|R

50|$|Pigging {{systems are}} {{designed}} so that the pig is loaded into the launcher, which is pressured to launch the pig into the pipeline through a kicker line. In some cases, the pig {{is removed from the}} pipeline via the receiver {{at the end of each}} run. All systems must allow for the receipt of <b>pigs</b> at the <b>launcher,</b> as blockages in the pipeline may require the pigs to be pushed back to the launcher. Many systems are designed to pig the pipeline in either direction.|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyGassco is the {{operator}} of two platforms with gas transport functions. These platforms are getting old and require large modifications {{to extend the}} lifetime and maintain their functions. Rapid development in subsea technology the recent years enables functions that earlier where performed by offshore platforms to be converted into subsea systems. Subsea developments offer the potential of reduced CAPEX, OPEX and risk reduction in terms of HSE. This makes subsea developments an attractive alternative to conventional topside developments. As a case study, this thesis evaluates the challenges and opportunities related to moving the functions of Heimdal Riser Platform into a subsea system. The requirements of a mid/downstream operator such as Gassco have not been widely evaluated by the subsea industry. A subsea gas transition hub is fundamentally different from other subsea developments {{due to the fact}} that there is no production involved. Subsea production systems have an increasing demand for power due to their complexity. A subsea gas transition hub is simpler and the power demand is low compared. With no nearby topside host facilities, there are challenges with respect to the subsea power supply and communication. Traditionally these requirements are provided by an umbilical which are tied-back to a host platform. Considering the low power demand and the long offsets to nearby host facilities, a long and costly umbilical may be hard to justify. Hence has the focus of this thesis been to eliminate the requirement of an umbilical. Many R&D projects, with the objective of reducing costs and risks related to umbilicals, have commenced the later years. Although many of the projects have been successful, the umbilical maintains as the only option to meet subsea production systems requirements. In this thesis, based on earlier studies, alternative solutions for power supply and communication have been evaluated. All the equipment that are required to maintain the gas transport functions will be incorporated within a 230 tons subsea manifold(excluding protection structure). This includes a remotely operated subsea flow control valve, a subsea High Integrity Pressure Protection System (HIPPS) and a subsea <b>pig</b> <b>launcher</b> guiding base. The structure also incorporate isolation valves which facilitate the opportunity to retrieve the HIPPS and flow control modules if maintenance is required. The subsea control system is based on the All-Electric technology which eliminates the requirement of hydraulics for valve actuation. The control system is powered by a rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery package which requires periodic recharging of energy from an intervention vessel. Communication between the subsea system and the master control station is provided by a connection to the integrated subsea fibre network in the North Sea. This subsea concept implements technologies that have not been widely used by the industry, hence a qualification program must be initiated before a fully functional subsea gas transition hub is ready for installation...|$|R
