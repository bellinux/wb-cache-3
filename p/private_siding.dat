5|$|The Wrington Vale line {{closed in}} 1931, with traffic having dropped to only two trains per day with no Sunday service. In 1938 coal traffic {{to the gas}} works ended, though there was some through coal traffic along the Clevedon branch. The Cheddar line was not faring well either: the number of tickets sold along the line had {{decreased}} dramatically since the early 1900s, although {{there was still a}} significant flow of strawberries, milk and cheese to London. The railways were nationalised in 1948, with the GWR becoming the Western Region of British Railways, but this did not halt the decline. The line was closed to passengers in 1963, with the only traffic to serve a <b>private</b> <b>siding</b> near Cheddar, but this too closed in 1969.|$|E

5000|$|Lake Anna is {{approximately}} 17 mi long from tip to tip, with 200 mi of shoreline. The lake {{is divided into}} two sides: the public side (also known as the [...] "cold" [...] <b>side)</b> and the <b>private</b> <b>side</b> (also known as the [...] "hot" [...] side). The public side is roughly 9000 acre, while the <b>private</b> <b>side</b> is roughly 4000 acre. The <b>private</b> <b>side</b> is formed of three main bodies of water, connected by navigable canals. The public and <b>private</b> <b>sides</b> are divided by three stone dikes. The <b>private</b> <b>side</b> has no marinas or public access ramps; only property owners and North Anna Power Station employees have access to the waters of the <b>private</b> <b>side.</b> The public side has several marinas and boat launches, including a boat ramp at the state park. The public side sees significantly higher boat traffic than the <b>private</b> <b>side,</b> especially on summer weekends.|$|R

5000|$|The public side {{is known}} as the [...] "cold" [...] side because it {{provides}} water to cool the generators at the power plant; the private or [...] "hot" [...] side receives warm water discharge from the power plant. The <b>private</b> <b>side</b> can be substantially warmer than the public side, especially near the discharge point, where it can be too hot for swimming. The <b>private</b> <b>side</b> has an extended water sports season. Some water circulates back out of the <b>private</b> <b>side</b> into the public side through underground channels; consequently, the public side is warmer in the southern area near the dam. In the winter, some fish migrate to these warmer waters.|$|R
25|$|The {{petition}} {{was presented}} to the ARC, which formally endorsed it and passed it to its subsidiary, ARTA, recommending that passenger services should be started to both Onehunga and to Helensville. The petition was later handed back by ARTA to the ARC, with ARTA stating that the track was the responsibility of government track organisation, ONTRACK (now part of KiwiRail). The petition {{was presented to}} Parliament's Transport and Labour Relations Select Committee by Lee as Chairman of the ARC. On 13 March 2007 the Government announced that it had given approval for ONTRACK to spend $10 million on reopening the line for passengers and freight. As part of the rehabilitation work a <b>private</b> <b>siding</b> was built at the Owens truck depot.|$|E
500|$|In 1897, East Sussex County Council {{purchased}} [...] of land at Park Farm, {{about three}} miles (5km) north of Hailsham, from the Earl of Chichester, to {{be the site of}} a new county lunatic asylum that became Hellingly Hospital. Construction work on the hospital began in 1900, to the design of George Thomas Hine, who had designed the nearby Haywards Heath Asylum. Building materials were transported to the site by a mile (2km) standard gauge <b>private</b> <b>siding</b> from the goods yard at Hellingly railway station on the Cuckoo Line. The connection was built by the asylum's builders, Joseph Howe & Company, and was authorised by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) on condition that East Sussex Council paid the cost, estimated at £1,700.|$|E

Rail transportation access is available, with a private switch engine for yard movements and <b>private</b> <b>siding</b> for loading and unloading.

Five shore cranes with a 250-ton capacity and 26 forklifts, each with a 26-ton capacity, are also available.|$|E
2500|$|Some of the {{requested}} improvements {{resulted in a}} new timetable being introduced including four daily weekday trains, a <b>private</b> <b>siding</b> to a sawmill at Hope, the provision of a tractor at Nelson {{to assist with the}} unloading of lime, and the addition of 17 new wagons from Blenheim. [...] However, these changes arrived too late to be of much use; the tractor arrived 7 months later, and the new wagons didn’t start arriving until May 1955. [...] That same month, the Progress League conceded that the guarantees would not be honoured, with only 12,500 of the promised 28,815 carried to date. [...] Though the performance of the railway did improve, it was not enough, and on 15 August 1955 the Prime Minister announced that the railway would close on 3 September. [...] At just after 16:00 on Friday 2 September, the last scheduled train on the Nelson Section completed its journey.|$|E

2500|$|During {{this period}} the LBSCR {{was once again}} {{experiencing}} financial difficulties and traffic, poor in 1882, was worse still the following year. This time services were not cut back, even expanded so that, by January 1884, seven daily services ran between Tunbridge Wells and Brighton, plus two goods services on Fridays. Furthermore, a <b>private</b> <b>siding</b> was brought into use for Imberhorne Farm between East Grinstead and Grange Road {{on the north side}} of the line. Traffic began to pick up again by 1887 coinciding with the opening on 1 October 1888 of the Oxted and Groombridge Railway: a direct line from Oxted to Tunbridge Wells via Edenbridge which would join the Three Bridges line approximately [...] to the west of Withyham. The 13 extra daily services brought by the new connection led to the doubling of the section between the junction with the new line, Ashurst Junction, and Groombridge. It also led to the installation of a second (island) platform at Tunbridge Wells Central.|$|E

The idea {{is that there is a}} completion of story in both the individual poem and in the collection as a whole. For this reason the poems run in linier time, from 1892 - 2008. One of the main things I wanted for this collection was a way to pay homage to the machinists, ironworkers, and construction workers who have impacted my life. These workers are often stereotyped as both physically and emotionally hard; I wanted to go beyond that and show a <b>private</b> <b>side</b> that is often both tender and emotionally available...|$|R
