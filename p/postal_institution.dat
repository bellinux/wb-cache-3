5000|$|The Main Post office, whose {{history of}} service {{dates back to}} the forties of the nineteenth century, was the highest <b>postal</b> <b>institution</b> not only in Serbia but in the whole of the Кingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later the Кingdom of Yugoslavia. On the other hand, the Post Office Savings Bank began {{operations}} on 1 October 1923 at the Palace “Мoskvа“ in Теrazije [...] Although a young institution, the Post Office Savings Bank became one of the [...] "most popular financial institutions" [...] in the whole country after a few years of operation, so the rooms of the Palace “Moscow“ became too small for her work. The authorities solved the question of inadequate accommodation of both institutions with the construction of a single building of the Main Post Office and the Post Office Savings Bank.|$|E
50|$|Architecture of the Palace of the Post Office Savings Bank, Main Post Office and Main Telegraph in Belgrade {{reflects}} {{the complexity of}} the social, political, stylistic and aesthetic circumstances that ruled the entire artistic creativity of the interwar period. It is based on a combination of modernist and functional base and representatively molded facades in the academic style. New Androsov’s project largely relied on the initial competition solution, which is primarily reflected in the decision of the base and disposition of space. Relations of mass, the position of the building in relation to the street, contours of the asymmetrically resolved basis, as well as the city and entrance number were retained from the original project to detail. All facades of the freestanding palace were recomposed according to the principles of academic monumental architecture, typical of the architecture of Belgrade of the fourth decade, while instead of the rather simple facades with combined glass and concrete, the author predicted cladding with granite slabs and artificial stone. The highlighted avant-corps of the main facade, except that it shares the façade canvas into two unequal, asymmetrical parts, also {{reflects the}} internal functional division of the object. The avant-corps is treated as a façade and outlined by the main portal in the ground-floor, elongated by Doric columns in the zone from the second to the fifth floor and a characteristic tower with a clock in the highest zone. Adjusting the modern concept of building to visually expressing the strength and prosperity of the new Yugoslav state and Belgrade as its capital with a representative academic base of its expression reflected the widely accepted attitude of the government with the monumental character of public buildings, designed in the style of high-academicism. As the building of the central and the most important <b>postal</b> <b>institution</b> in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Palace of the Main Post Office is an important testimony to the development of postal services and activities, from its founding to the present. On the other hand, its striking position at the crossroads of two important city roads, {{is one of the most}} important visual benchmarks of the city center. At the same time, the monumentality of the continent and the representativeness of the external processing classify it among the major examples of academic architecture of Belgrade.|$|E
5000|$|In 1911 major {{points of}} the {{contract}} were amended by a new agreement, which came into force on January 1, 1912. The postal administration was still managed by Austria, but all existing <b>postal</b> <b>institutions</b> were then called [...] "K. k. österreichisches u. fürstlich liechtensteinsches Post- u. Telegraphenamt", which effected only some official seals then showing together the two coat of arms. Their own stamps for the use at Liechtenstein's post offices were issued too, but the Austrian stamps were still valid. The Austrian postal administration had to pay a general sum of 10,000 kronen per year for the assignment of the service. On October 1, 1916, that sum was increased to 14,000 kronen.|$|R
25|$|Next to the {{national}} and <b>postal</b> <b>institutions</b> of the states, private delivery services existed of which some used its own adhesives. The legal basis for this was laid on 27 April 1859, when the Colombian Parliament of the Confederation stated by law that the Postal Service {{should not be the}} monopoly of the central government, but that the Colombian governments, businesses and even individuals should be part of it, even in the same postal routes established by the Central Government. A total of 14 entities issued stamps for their private mail service, most of them in the 1920s and 1930s. In the nineteenth century there existed two private services, the 1870 Correo Semanal Del Dorado in the Guasca District and the 1882 Barranquilla OASM delivery service.|$|R
40|$|Bachelor {{thesis is}} dealing with the {{liberalization}} of the postal service market in the Czech Republic. Thesis analyzes the selected issue in the practical part on the example of the Czech Post, state enterprise. It clarifies the areas and terms closely linked with the issue. Thesis also defines monopoly features and specifies the network industry. It deals with the privatization process, defines the essential features of the state-owned enterprise and other main business corporations. Text explains the theory of public choice and its related problems. It also focuses on postal license which commits to provide universal service. The aim of the thesis is to create a comprehensive overview of past and current state of the postal market. Another objective is to analyze Czech Post enterprise particularly its economic activity and legal form. It turns out that the Czech Post is not now as lossy as it appears in public. We can predict decreasing trend in the evolution of revenues in the future with the help of related graph. Thesis objectives are met by composing the general development of the legislative and institutional changes. We can compare the legal forms of institutions and the extent of branch networks in each country {{with the help of a}} comparative analysis of European <b>postal</b> <b>institutions.</b> The Czech Republic does well - it is below the average. This allows to set conclusions and recommendations for our market. We mainly used issues of Post Partner project to examine the future development of the Czech Post...|$|R

Defence date: 7 October 2013 Despite their immense {{potential}} as information sources, postage stamps have been virtually ignored in academic research. Therefore, {{in this thesis}} I study how official national imaginaries have been promoted through iconographic and written messages in postage stamps; how such messages {{are linked to the}} ideology, interests and goals of political elites; and how competing elites and groups with relative power within the state try to influence such official ideas about the nation. The thesis is divided in three sections. The first presents a theoretical framework for the study of national imaginaries. It also presents the properties of stamps that made them ideal 'carriers’ of ideological propaganda. The second section analyses a random sample of 1, 000 stamps by means of a typology of ideological messages. It was found {{that the vast majority of}} stamps are carrying messages related to the features, composition, and historical development of the nation that issued the stamp. Then, these 'nationalist’ stamps were further studied by means of a second typology, in order to differentiate the particular aspects of the nation that were promoted in each stamp. The third section analyses the political goals and processes behind nationalist messages in stamps. For that, both the United Kingdom during 1950 - 1970 and post-revolutionary Mexico were studied using process-tracing methodology. It was found that, while the most important actors are still the ruling elites, other actors such as competing elites, local authorities, pressure groups or social organizations will also try to influence the messages about the nation in stamps. A relevant finding is that intermediate structures, such as middle-range public officers in <b>postal</b> <b>institutions,</b> can have a key role not only in the promotion, but also in the shaping of official national imaginaries...|$|R
50|$|However {{rebuilding}} was rapid. Mail delivery {{was operating}} again from March 1945 in Budapest and from May {{in the whole}} country, with money orders starting in June and package delivery, telephone and telegraph in July. From 1 May 1945 the Hungarian Radio Corporation broadcast again. Recovery, including buildings and personnel, was not complete until 1952. Consistent with the political climate, the Hungarian Post was gradually nationalized after 1947, with several <b>postal</b> companies and <b>institutions</b> either ceasing to exist or {{becoming part of the}} national organisation.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop an {{experimental}} model which links inter-institutional flow of funds to real macroeconomy and then to estimate quantitatively the effects of changing scale of postal savings or government financial institutions on GDP. The empirical analysis indicates that at least after 1980 expanding size of postal saving and government financial institutions had negative effects on GDP. It implies that reducing scale of public financial institutions could improve the performance of real macroeconomy. Flow of funds, Public financial <b>institutions,</b> <b>Postal</b> saving...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how diversely organized capitalist societies evolve {{by analyzing the}} transformation of Japan’s financial system since the 1990 s. The banking, securities, and insurance, {{as well as the}} <b>postal</b> financial <b>institutions</b> changed significantly, but are hardly converging to Anglo-American or ‘liberal market’ models. We contend that Japan’s new financial system is best characterized as syncretic, with new, traditional and hybrid forms of practices, organizations and norms coexisting. Syncretism in industry was driven by a distinctive pattern of interest group politics we call syncretization. Strong political leadership, facing serious electoral threats, shifted the policy logic from gradual incremental reforms following traditional interest group dynamics, to rapid reforms that excluded the traditionally powerful interest groups most affected by these reforms. We support the notion that diverse industry outcomes can be complementary to broader political economy reforms that take Japan away from its traditional model, part of a broader ‘convergence towards diversity’...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we would like}} to reconsider certain {{managerial}} and economic items of some controversial topics of public finance especially concerning the typical nation-run financial organization, the <b>Postal</b> Saving <b>Institution</b> in Japan. Even in the long recession, the deregulation policy program toward banking and financial services industries could be effected, it is observed. Whether or not discussions concerning the privatization of the Postal Savings would become more popular among certain stake-holders including the household sector, it still should be expected that the more continuous and overall managerial restructuring policy with vigorous strategies to pursue the very efficiency in the business by the Institution could be retained. As the organization of public enterprise, the domain and scope of business would also involve fields of financial services for households and small-sized firms in local areas, while giving some adequate consideration to meet the customer’s satisfaction and R&D that could to some extent cover and develop the loan business, as well as play the role of being public incubator, and also to cope with the case of market failures...|$|R

The first section deals with external challenges to EADTU institutions, including competition from new services, new funding programs, pressure from national governments, and the Europeanization of education. Internal challenges are identified {{as the need for}} clearly defined policies regarding transborder activities, low use of technology in member institutions, communication between member <b>institutions</b> (<b>postal</b> services, courier services, telephone, telefacsimile, face-to-face meetings, and audioconferencing), joint course production, transborder delivery of courses, and European-wide course design and delivery. Requirements for member institutions indicated by these challenges are summarized: greater use of established technologies; development of new course designs that exploit new technologies; and development of better communications systems between EADTU institutions.

40|$|Post offices, {{inherited}} from the Industrial Revolution, were monolithic telephone and postal administrations. They were intimately linked to the fabric of nations and {{made significant contributions to}} state finances. From the 1960 s onwards, integrators, such as UPS and FEDEX, started offering end-to-end express services, thus challenging the postal monopoly in new high added value services. Gradually, the liberalization paradigm gained ground. Telecommunications and sometimes financial services were spun off from postal operations. More recently, new policies and priorities started to emerge especially on the development agenda where financial inclusion has become a top priority in the developing world. The question to be addressed is which role, if any, the posts play or could play in ensuring inclusion. Despite an exceptionally scarce research in the field, this paper provides an overview of how these shifts in paradigm have affected postal policy, the postal financial services regulatory framework, the status of the organizations delivering those services and the offerings themselves in developing as well as in developed countries. After a research review, including the regulatory dimension, the paper focuses on how <b>postal</b> financial services <b>institutions</b> in their legal framework have developed bringing to the fore a panorama of a dozen of promising transformations of financial postal services in developing countries...|$|R
5000|$|In common usage from 1840 onward, [...] "Palestine" [...] {{was used}} either to {{describe}} the consular jurisdictions of the Western powers or for a region that extended in the north-south direction typically from Rafah (south-east of Gaza) to the Litani River (now in Lebanon). The western boundary was the sea, and the eastern boundary was the poorly defined place where the Syrian desert began. In various European sources, the eastern boundary was placed anywhere from the Jordan River to slightly east of Amman. The Negev Desert was not included. The Consuls were originally magistrates who tried cases involving their own citizens in foreign territories. While the jurisdictions in the secular states of Europe had become territorial, the Ottomans perpetuated the legal system they inherited from the Byzantine Empire. The law in many matters was personal, not territorial, and the individual citizen carried his nation's law with him wherever he went. Capitulatory law applied to foreigners in Palestine. Only Consular Courts of the State of the foreigners concerned were competent to try them. That was true, not only in cases involving personal status, but also in criminal and commercial matters. According to American Ambassador Morgenthau, Turkey had never been an independent sovereignty. The Western Powers had their own courts, marshals, colonies, schools, <b>postal</b> systems, religious <b>institutions,</b> and prisons. The Consuls also extended protections to large communities of Jewish protégés who had settled in Palestine.|$|R
40|$|N. B. Viewi given {{are those}} of the author not the BMA For health institutions, {{euthanasia}} represents an increasingly complex but increasingly inescapable debate, in which the expectations of health professionals have moved away from the declaratory answer in search of greater sophistication and clarity. The House of Lords'Committee on Medical Ethics drew attention to the unavoidable complexity of future medical decisions at the end of life, the inexorably changing doctor-patient relationship and the demographic shift resulting in greater numbers surviving longer to face chronic, degenerative conditions. The committee proved a watershed in many respects, not least in the moral debate it triggered in the public and among health professionals. Arguably it aired questions which still have not been conclusively answered. Its questioning mirrored the trend observable among the institutions'membership for rigour and detail to justify the positions adopted It represents one facet of the pressure on health institutions, whose previous mode of dealing with the euthanasia debate was by declaration and some would say by pontification. Their reticence to probe deeper was undoubtedly based partly on the conviction that detailed debate about euthanasia was an anathema within professional groups committed to the traditional life-preserving goal of medicine. Also influential has been the assumption that it would be otiose for professional bodies to issue guidance on matters unambiguously covered by law. Arguably, both of these views should have been challenged if not dispelled by the effort involved in contributing evidence to the House of Lords'Committee. That exercise exposed the need for guidance and the ambiguities at law but {{it remains to be seen}} how the debate will be taken forward, or not, by health <b>institutions.</b> <b>Postal</b> address...|$|R
