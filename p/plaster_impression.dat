He showed the jury how the discovered jawbone fit exactly into a <b>plaster</b> <b>impression</b> that he had made of Parkman's jaw. A fire alarm then rang from the building where Clifford had his belongings, so the court recessed while he went to retrieve them.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of 3 D {{printing}} for patients that require localised radiotherapy treatment to the face. The current process involves producing a lead mask {{in order to protect}} the healthy tissue from the effects of the radiotherapy. The mask is produced by applying a thermoplastic sheet to the patient’s face and allowing to set hard. This can then be used as a mould to create a <b>plaster</b> <b>impression</b> of the patient’s face. A sheet of lead is then hammered on to the plaster to create a bespoke fitted face mask. This process can be distressing for patients and can be problematic when the patient is required to remain motionless for a prolonged time while the thermoplastic sets. In this study, a 1 : 1 scale 3 D print of a patient’s face was generated using a laser scanner. The lead was hammered directly on to the surface of the 3 D print in order to create a bespoke fitted treatment mask. This eliminated the thermoplastic moulding stage and significantly reduced the time needed for the patient to be in clinic. The higher definition impression of the face resulted in a more accurate, better fitting treatment mask...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of 7 different implant impression techniques for full-arch prostheses. Materials and Methods: A master cast simulating an edentulous arch with 4 implants was used. Seven impression techniques were tested: open tray with polyether Impregum (OTI); open tray with splint-polyether Impregum (OTSI); closed tray with polyether Impregum; open tray with polyether Ramitec; open tray with splintpolyether Ramitec; closed tray with polyether Ramitec (CTR); open tray with <b>impression</b> <b>plaster</b> (OTP). Five <b>impressions</b> of the master cast were taken for each technique using an impression simulator device. Casts were realized based on those impressions (n = 35). Median values of deviation from the master cast were recorded for each cast through a 3 -dimensional laser scanner. Results: Only OTI (P = 0. 028) and OTSI (P < 0. 001) presented a statistically significant difference compared to the master cast. OTP (P = 0. 99) and CTR (P = 0. 10) showed median values of deviation close to zero (- 0. 001 and- 0. 003 mm, respectively). Conclusion: Stiff impression materials (such as plaster or rigid polyether) guarantee greater accuracy in cases of multiple implant impressions of patients with full-arch rehabilitations.

40|$|Statement of the problem: Conventional {{techniques}} for implant framework fabrication {{have been shown}} to produce errors that are inconsistent with the passive-fit requirement for osseointegrated implant frameworks. Purpose: The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the three-dimensional distortion inherent in casting of full arch, screw-retained titanium implant frameworks. Materials and methods: A conventional commercial laboratory one-piece casting, using the lost-wax technique was used. Five wax patterns were fabricated on a die-stone cast poured from a <b>plaster</b> <b>impression</b> of a five-fixture brass analogue. A reflex microscope was used to determine the three-dimensional casting error, by measuring horizontal and vertical distances for each wax pattern and its corresponding cast titanium framework, as well as offset distances from the horizontal reference plane. Results: Significant differences were found in the amount of distortion between wax patterns and cast frameworks, with the castings being approximately 416 μm to 477 μm larger than the wax frameworks. The greatest amount of distortion occurred at the terminal implant abutments, and in the vertical dimension. However, there was inconsistency in these differences, indicating the three-dimensional nature of the overall distortion of the cast frameworks. Conclusions: It is doubtful whether any conventionally cast framework can be made to the degree of accuracy required to fit passively on its abutments because of the multiple variables inherent in this process. It is therefore recommended that all full-arch, cast titanium frameworks be cast in sections, or alternatively be sectioned, indexed and soldered before being seated intraorally...|$|E

Records of {{historic}} and cultural information regarding {{most of the}} major island empires, kingdoms, sultanates, and protectorates within the greater Pacific Basin. Twelfth holographic account of Dr. John Rabe's California and Pacific regions period. This journal recounts the Doctor's voyages to the Samoan Islands and to the Tongan or Friendly Islands and Dr. Rabe's experiences in these Polynesian Archipelagos. He sailed from San Francisco June 23 aboard the schooner "Golden Fleece" bound first for Apia, Samoa, Captain Henderson in command. The "Golden Fleece" arrived at Apia on July 22, 1887. At this time the vessel sent to Samoa by the King of Hawaii, Kalakaua, was at Apia. A band concert was given by the Hawaiian lads, then a party was attended at the Hawaiian Consulate in honor of Kalakaua's departing man-of-war. The Commander was one Captain Jackson—an Australian who was drunk most of the time (tallies with other historical accounts). His crew is described as ex-inmates of the Hawaii reformatory and a "tuff set". Dr. Rabe accompanied the Samoan Chief Justice down the coast aboard the Hawaii man-of-war for six miles to Afunga to see King Malietoa's town give the vessel a farewell. They steamed at 3 to 4 knots. Germans land troops and guns and place Apia under martial law, declaring war against King Malietoa. Tamasese was declared King by the Germans, with several proclamations that were answered negatively by the U. S. and British Consuls. Much of the activities of Germans are recorded, also comments on Malietoa, who had hidden out in the bush with his royal guardsmen. The rebel King Tamasese called Dr. Rabe out of bed to work on his teeth. "He is over 7 feet and has an awful large mouth. I have been wishing and planning to get him in my hands and secure a model of his teeth and jaws for a specimen. Cleaning his teeth {{and at the same time}} I took two <b>plaster</b> <b>impressions</b> of his upper jaw. It took my biggest cup—No. I—and had to flatten it out like a saucer and when finished it was larger than my hand and resembled a young scoop shovel. And even then it was not quite large enough to take in one of his wisdom teeth. " The Doctor traced an outline of His Majesty King Tamesese's upper jaw casting and dated it. A great deal more is recorded of what R. L. Stevenson referred to as "The Samoan Imbraglio," also much of his observations of the customs and habits of the Samoans.

40|$|Objective: A flat foot is {{a complex}} {{postural}} deformity in which the medial longitudinal arch is decreased. It is associated with diverse symptoms and varying degrees of deformity and disability. This disorder can sometimes contribute to problems in the ankles and knee as it can alter the alignment. Conservative treatments are used to treat patients with a flat foot. One common treatment {{is the use of}} insoles with medial heel skive technique. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of custom-molded insoles with new technique on pain and function in females with a flexible flat foot. Materials & Methods: This research is a quasi-experimental study of before-and-after type that included 12 subjects with a flexible flat foot from the Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences University of Tehran. To provide a negative cast, <b>plaster</b> cast <b>impressions</b> were taken for each participant’s foot. According to the method of modification (medial heel skive) that was introduced by Kirby, the positive cast of the foot was corrected. Each person received an insole with medial heel skive technique. The pain and function of each foot were evaluated with a visual analogue scale and Foot and Ankle Outcome Score before applying the treatment and at six weeks follow-up. Paired t-test and non-parametric tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: It was found that the pain and function significantly improved after 6 weeks of using insoles with medial heel skive technique in subjects with flat foot (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: According to our findings, there was a significant difference in pain and function in patients with a flat foot through medial heel skive technique.

With due consideration to safety of the patients and dental professionals, {{it is essential that}} the trade of these materials is in conformity with the law. Aim: To perform the legal analysis of the information displayed on the packaging of dental materials. Materials and Methods: The Bureau of Indian Standards sets guidelines for packaging and marketing of dental products in India. An exploratory cross-sectional study was performed using various search engines and websites to access the laws and regulations existing pertaining to dental materials packaging. Based on the data obtained, a unique packaging standardization checklist was developed. Dental laboratory and <b>impression</b> <b>plasters,</b> alginates, and endodontic instruments were surveyed for all the available brands. This study considered 16 brands of plasters and alginates and 42 brands of endodontic instruments for legal analysis. Legal analysis was performed using the direct observation checklist. Descriptive statistics were obtained using SPSS version 19.

40|$|A maxillary {{obturator}} for the edentulous patient {{must be as}} lightweight {{as possible}} and provide for retention, stability, patient comfort, and cleanliness. The weight of a maxillary obturator is often a dislocat-ing factor. Patients who have hollow obturators may complain of food, fluid, and mucous accumulations that result in bad odors and altered taste sensation. This tip describes a simple, quick technique for using an autopolymerizing resin to convert an existing hol-low obturator into a hollow bulb (Fig. 1). PROCEDURE 1. Use utility wax to fill in and shape the bulb por-tion of the obturator (Fig. 2). 2. Use <b>impression</b> <b>plaster</b> to fabricate a matrix of the obturator bulb (Fig. 3). 3. Remove the utility wax, and relieve the area where bonding with autopolymerizing resin will take place. Make dovetail groves with an inverted cone bur for added retention. Wet the obturator area with fresh monomer. 4. Place mixed autopolymerizing acrylic resin into the matrix, making sure the acrylic touches and coats all surfaces of the matrix (Fig. 4). 5. Firmly place the prosthesis into the matrix, keeping the lid side down. Allow ample time for it to cure with a rubber band wrapped firmly around the prosthesis and matrix (Fig. 5). Use the unused portion of the autopolymerizing acrylic as a gauge for determining when the acrylic has set. It is crucial that the obturator not be placed in warm water or a pressure pot during curing. Heat will cause the gas inside the bulb to expand and push through the seal, cre-ating a hole; a pressure pot will cause the gas to shrink, creating a suck-in defect that will disrupt the bulb’s seal. 6.

40|$|Purpose It {{is known}} that distortions can occur during {{impression}} making and the pouring of casts, and that this distortion may produce inaccuracies of subsequent castings, especially long span castings for implant superstructures. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the ability of different impression materials to reproduce the positions of 5 implant analogues on a master model, in terms of their accuracy and the accuracy of a resultant cast, relative to the master model. Method The master model was a stainless steel model with 5 implant analogues. The impression materials used were <b>impression</b> <b>plaster</b> (Plastogum), a polyether (Impregum Penta), and two polyvinyl siloxane materials (Aquasil Monophase and Aquasil putty with light body wash). Five impressions were made with each impression material and cast in Satin stone under controlled conditions. The positions of the implants on the master model, the impression copings, and the implant analogues in the subsequent cast were measured using a co-ordinate measuring machine which measures within 4 μm of accuracy. Results Statistical analysis using a one factor t-test indicated that distortion occurred in all the impression materials, but inconsistently. Aquasil Monophase reproduced the master model most accurately. Although there was no significant distortion between the Aquasil monophase impressions and the master model or between the impressions and their casts, there were distortions between the master model and the master cast, which highlighted the cumulative effects of the distortions. Impregum’s performance proved to be the most reliable in terms of predictability. Plastogum displayed cumulative distortion and with Aquasil putty with light body, these impression materials had the least reliability. Conclusions Some of the distortions observed are of clinical significance and likely to contribute to a lack of passive fit of any superstructure. The unpredictability of such distortions may mean that the future of accurate impressions and superstructures may lie in the digital world...|$|R
5000|$|After the {{investigation}} at Baia Mare, {{the two were}} sent to Oradea prison, which [...] "... {{was in fact a}} dungeon, reminiscent from the Hungarian times, with one meter thick walls and iron bars latticed windows, behind which, visible from the outside, the broken glass and peeled <b>plaster</b> gave the <b>impression</b> of a deserted building." [...] Here they reunited {{with the rest of the}} escapees, who had also been recaptured. During the cross-examination preceding the trial, it became clear that one of them was a denouncer, as the investigators had a very deep insight about the escape plans, connections between the Cavnic prisoners and civilian workers and personal details about the escapees. It turned out that the culprit was Alexandru Ciocâlteu, a surprise at first for Ioanid, since Ducu was one of the most actively involved prisoners in the escape planning. After his capture, the same qualities that his colleagues appreciated, intelligence and energy, were turned against those he had helped to escape.Aside the 13 escapees, also the civilians and other prisoners who helped them escape were held at Oradea. This way, it was possible to find out what were the consequences of their actions on the other prisoners at Cavnic. Although their ordeal worsened, with daily raids and searching through the barracks, increased and impossible quotas in the mine, as well as hardened punishments for every small act of defiance, the inmates did not show grudge on the group and had unanimous support towards their actions.All the members of the group had received previously severe terms in prison, so for some there was the fear that the Cavnic incident may lead to the capital punishment. As the strongest supporter of this idea, Ciocâlteu tried to convince the others that the best solution would be to show full cooperation with the secret police. On the other side, the rest of the group had no intention on cooperating with the authorities, and put pressure on Ciocâlteu so he would withdraw the statements made during the inquiry. He was treated as an informer, a snitch, which was one of the worst offenses within the prison walls. As a result, during the following trial, trying to please both parts, he made confusing statements, which only helped the prosecution, used to manipulate ambiguous statements to its advantage. In the end, Ioanid's sentence was one year for prison escaping, five years for use of explosives (which, although he manufactured, he did not use) and eight years for political conspiracy in prison. The first two sentences were merged in the highest one and three years were added for aggravating circumstances, in the end resulting in additional eleven years to serve. Later, this conviction was merged to the previous one of 20 years hard labor. The incarceration conditions were severe, as the winter of 1953-1954 was very cold.|$|R
