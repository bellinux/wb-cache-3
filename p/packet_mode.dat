40|$|A packet {{forwarding}} node (20) of a {{transport network}} (10) performs a first <b>packet</b> forwarding <b>mode</b> in which received packets (51) are processed and forwarded on a per-packet basis. The forwarding node performs a second <b>packet</b> forwarding <b>mode</b> when the node identifies a group (50) of consecutive packets (51). The group of packets are {{destined for the}} same destination node of the transport network (10). The second <b>packet</b> forwarding <b>mode</b> comprises determining a forwarding treatment for the group of packets (51) and forwarding the group of packets with the determined treatment. The forwarding is performed without processing the headers (52) of {{at least some of}} the packets in the group. The group (50) of consecutive packets (51) is identified by a control packet (60) preceding the group (50) or by inter-packet signalling (53) which indicates that the packet before the inter-packet signalling and the packet after the inter-packet signalling are to be treated as part of the same group. Packets which are determined to be received on transit channels can be forwarded without processing headers of individual packets...|$|R

50|$|<b>Packet</b> <b>mode</b> {{communication}} may {{be implemented}} {{with or without}} intermediate forwarding nodes (packet switches or routers). Packets are normally forwarded by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in, first-out buffering, but may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing, traffic shaping, or for differentiated or guaranteed quality of service, such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket. In case of a shared physical medium (such as radio or 10BASE5), the packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme.|$|E
30|$|Vehicle-assisted data {{delivery}} (VADD) {{is proposed}} in [27]. VADD {{is based on}} the carry-and-forward technique and is used to improve routing in disconnected vehicular networks. The decision regarding the next forwarding route is made at the intersection with preference to the one offering minimal packet delivery delay. The intersection is divided into branches one of which serves as the chosen path. Three <b>packet</b> <b>modes</b> are swapped to select the packet forwarding path: (1) intersection, (2) straight way, and (3) destination. If failed network links are observed during the network operation, VADD can result in selecting an incorrect path and leads to poor performance. Also, vehicle density is variable whereas VADD calculates packet forwarding delay using data based on certain stats. Hence, if up-to-date data concerning vehicular density is not available to the node that needs to forward data, an incorrect path may be selected.|$|R

Data compression of the Advanced Range Telemetry (ARTM) PCM data sets in the frame and <b>packet</b> <b>modes,</b> and for the entire data file will be considered and compared. The technique of differencing data will also be applied to the data files by subtracting the previous major frame and then applying compression techniques. It will be demonstrated that telemetry compression is a viable option to reduce the amount of data to be transmitted, and hence the bandwidth. However, this compression produces variable-length data segments with implications for real-time data synchronization...|$|R
40|$|In {{the absence}} of {{nonlinearity}} all eigenmodes of a chain with disorder are spatially localized (Anderson localization). The width of the eigenvalue spectrum, and the average eigenvalue spacing inside the localization volume, set two frequency scales. An initially localized wavepacket spreads {{in the presence of}} nonlinearity. Nonlinearity introduces frequency shifts, which define three different evolution outcomes: i) localization as a transient, with subsequent subdiffusion; ii) {{the absence of}} the transient, and immediate subdiffusion; iii) selftrapping of a part of the packet, and subdiffusion of the remainder. The subdiffusive spreading is due to a finite number of <b>packet</b> <b>modes</b> being resonant. This number does not change on average, and depends only on the disorder strength. Spreading is due to corresponding weak chaos inside the packet, which slowly heats the cold exterior. The second moment of the packet is increasing as t^α. We find α= 1 / 3.

EDGE meets the International Telecommunications Union's requirement for a 3G network, and has been accepted by the ITU as part of the IMT-2000 family of 3G standards.

50|$|The channel {{access control}} {{mechanisms}} provided by the MAC layer are {{also known as a}} multiple access protocol. This makes it possible for several stations connected to the same physical medium to share it. Examples of shared physical media are bus networks, ring networks, hub networks, wireless networks and half-duplex point-to-point links. The multiple access protocol may detect or avoid data packet collisions if a <b>packet</b> <b>mode</b> contention based channel access method is used, or reserve resources to establish a logical channel if a circuit-switched or channelization-based channel access method is used. The channel access control mechanism relies on a physical layer multiplex scheme.|$|E

Telephone exchanges have become digital and software controlled, facilitating many value added services. For example, the first AXE telephone exchange was presented in 1976. Since the late 1980s, digital communication to the end user has been possible using Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) services. Since {{the end of the}} 1990s, broadband access techniques such as ADSL, Cable modems, fiber-to-the-building (FTTB) and fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) have become widespread to small offices and homes.

Firstly, we design a position data updating model based on Kalman filter difference predicting equations. Then, we design a <b>packet</b> repetition <b>mode</b> decision algorithm, which is applied to deliver vehicle position updating data. The model with packet repetition can not only generate position updating data according to preset threshold, but also decide <b>packet</b> repetition <b>mode</b> related to the distance of two adjacent vehicles in order to reduce data loss. Both simulated highway and realistic urban road experimental results show that vehicle position data updating frequency could be obviously reduced and the reliability of the communication is greatly improved through packet repetition mechanism by using this position updating strategy...|$|R

50|$|Time-division {{multiple}} access (TDMA) is a channel access method for shared-medium networks. It allows several users {{to share the}} same frequency channel by dividing the signal into different time slots. The users transmit in rapid succession, one after the other, each using its own time slot. This allows multiple stations to share the same transmission medium (e.g. radio frequency channel) while using {{only a part of}} its channel capacity. TDMA is used in the digital 2G cellular systems such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), IS-136, Personal Digital Cellular (PDC) and iDEN, and in the Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) standard for portable phones. It is also used extensively in satellite systems, combat-net radio systems, and PON networks for upstream traffic from premises to the operator. For usage of Dynamic TDMA <b>packet</b> <b>mode</b> communication, see below.|$|E
40|$|Modern data {{communication}} networks are extremely complex {{and do not}} lend well to theoretical analysis. It is not unusual that network analysis can be rigorously made after leaving out several subtle details that cannot be easily captured in the analysis. As a result, <b>packet</b> <b>mode,</b> event driven simulation studies are usually resorted to better study the performance of network components, protocols, and their interaction. The major obstacle in <b>packet</b> <b>mode</b> simulation is, however, the vast number of packets {{that have to be}} simulated in order to produce accurate results, especially in large scale networks. What seems to be a reasonable solution is really to incorporate theoretical modeling into <b>packet</b> <b>mode</b> simulation.

30|$|The TA evaluates each CH’s {{trustworthiness}} using direct trust computation, {{which can}} be conducted using the encrypted <b>packet</b> <b>mode,</b> which encrypts packets exchanged between non-CH nodes and the TA.

40|$|This thesis reports {{research}} {{undertaken to}} address the deficiencies that existing standardised cryptographic constructs exhibit when securing <b>packet</b> <b>mode</b> wireless communication in WSN. The {{aim of the research}} is to devise innovative cryptographic frameworks, which will facilitate design and implementation of light-weight symmetric cryptographic modular constructs. Four cryptographic frameworks have been devised and block cipher based light-weight constructs using the frameworks have been designed and benchmarked against contemporary standard constructs. The constructs introduced in this dissertation, proved to be better suited to providing secure <b>packet</b> <b>mode</b> data communication, in applications utilising wireless networks consisting of characteristically constrained nodes. The four proposed frameworks are: - The Zone-based framework for data packet integrity and authentication security services is proposed and described. The Quicker Block Chaining (QBC) family of message authentication constructs designed using the framework, are shown, via software simulation, to operate with better efficiency (i. e. uses fewer instruction cycles) than similar contemporary standard constructs and with a comparable level of security. - The Hybrid Encryption Mode (HEM) framework for data packet confidentiality security service is proposed and described. The HEM framework facilitated the design of constructs that provide probabilistic, randomising and tweakable encryption. - The Joint Cypher Mode (JCM) framework for authenticated encryption with associated-data (AEAD) security service is proposed and described. The range of constructs designed using the JCM framework, are shown, via software simulation and practical deployment, to Design and Analysis of Light-weight Symmetric Cryptographic Frameworks and Constructs for Secure <b>Packet</b> <b>Mode</b> Wireless Communication operate with better efficiency (i. e. uses fewer instruction cycles) than contemporary standard constructs. - The Joint Authenticated Combined Mode (JACM) framework for authenticate authenticated-encryption with associated-data (AAEAD) security service is proposed and described. The new AAEAD secure packet paradigm addresses a limitation and cryptographic protection failure of the standardised AEAD secure packet paradigm, in communication scenarios when untrustworthy intermediary forwarding nodes are utilised to authenticate and relay packets. The outcomes of the research undertaken are relevant to practitioners and cryptographic engineers that require symmetric cryptographic light-weight constructs for providing secure <b>packet</b> <b>mode</b> communications. It is shown that the resulting light-weight symmetric cryptographic constructs are better suited to providing secure <b>packet</b> <b>mode</b> wireless networked communication...|$|E
