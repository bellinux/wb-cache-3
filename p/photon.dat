5|$|The <b>photon</b> is {{the gauge}} boson for electromagnetism, and {{therefore}} all other quantum {{numbers of the}} <b>photon</b> (such as lepton number, baryon number, and flavour quantum numbers) are zero. Also, the <b>photon</b> does not obey the Pauli exclusion principle.|$|E
5|$|A <b>photon</b> {{is a type}} of {{elementary}} particle, the quantum of the electromagnetic field including electromagnetic radiation such as light, and the force carrier for the electromagnetic force (even when static via virtual particles). The <b>photon</b> has zero rest mass and always moves {{at the speed of light}} within a vacuum.|$|E
5|$|An inelastic {{collision}} between a <b>photon</b> (light) and a solitary (free) electron is called Compton scattering. This collision {{results in a}} transfer of momentum and energy between the particles, which modifies the wavelength of the <b>photon</b> by an amount called the Compton shift.|$|E
50|$|Ballistic <b>photons</b> are {{the light}} <b>photons</b> that travel through a {{scattering}} (turbid) medium {{in a straight}} line. Also known as ballistic light. If laser pulses are sent through a turbid medium such as fog or body tissue, most of the <b>photons</b> are either randomly scattered or absorbed. However, across short distances, a few <b>photons</b> pass through the scattering medium in straight lines. These coherent <b>photons</b> {{are referred to as}} ballistic <b>photons.</b> <b>Photons</b> that are slightly scattered, retaining some degree of coherence, are referred to as snake <b>photons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When <b>photons</b> are {{scattered}} from an atom or molecule, most <b>photons</b> are elastically scattered (Rayleigh scattering), {{such that the}} scattered <b>photons</b> have the same energy (frequency and wavelength) as the incident <b>photons.</b> A {{small fraction of the}} scattered <b>photons</b> (approximately 1 in 10 million) {{are scattered}} by an excitation, with the scattered <b>photons</b> having a frequency different from, and usually lower than, that of the incident <b>photons.</b> In a gas, Raman scattering can occur with a change in energy of a molecule due to a transition to another (usually higher) energy level. Chemists are primarily concerned with this [...] "transitional" [...] Raman effect.|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{suggested}} to produce, {{with the help}} of colliding laser <b>photons</b> with bunches of relativistic ions having two energy levels, both intense beams of monochromatic polarized X-ray fluorescence <b>photons</b> and significant number of X-ray entangled <b>photons,</b> via double Doppler transformation. Nonlinear susceptibility of the ions, the cross section and the rate of production of such <b>photons</b> at RHIC are estimated. Such beams of X-ray <b>photons</b> can be detected and applied to solve various problems, {{in a manner similar to}} the usage of optical <b>photons...</b>|$|R
5|$|If a bound {{electron}} {{is in an}} excited state, an interacting <b>photon</b> with the proper energy can cause stimulated emission of a <b>photon</b> with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching {{the energy of the}} interacting <b>photon.</b> The emitted <b>photon</b> and the interacting <b>photon</b> then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make lasers, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.|$|E
5|$|Photons, {{like all}} quantum objects, exhibit wave-like and particle-like properties. Their dual wave–particle nature can be {{difficult}} to visualize. The <b>photon</b> displays clearly wave-like phenomena such as diffraction and interference on the length scale of its wavelength. For example, a single <b>photon</b> passing through a double-slit experiment exhibits interference phenomena but only if no measure was made at the slit. A single <b>photon</b> passing through a double-slit experiment lands on the screen with a probability distribution given by its interference pattern determined by Maxwell's equations. However, experiments confirm that the <b>photon</b> is not a short pulse of electromagnetic radiation; it does not spread out as it propagates, nor does it divide when it encounters a beam splitter. Rather, the <b>photon</b> seems to be a point-like particle since it is absorbed or emitted as a whole by arbitrarily small systems, systems much smaller than its wavelength, such as an atomic nucleus (≈10−15 m across) or even the point-like electron. Nevertheless, the <b>photon</b> is not a point-like particle whose trajectory is shaped probabilistically by the electromagnetic field, as conceived by Einstein and others; that hypothesis was also refuted by the photon-correlation experiments cited above. According to our present understanding, the electromagnetic field itself is produced by photons, which in turn result from a local gauge symmetry and the laws of quantum field theory (see the Second quantization and Gauge boson sections below).|$|E
5|$|Though general {{diffusion}} damping can damp perturbations in collisionless dark matter simply due to <b>photon</b> dispersion, the term Silk damping {{applies only to}} damping of adiabatic models of baryonic matter, which is coupled to the diffusing photons, not dark matter, and diffuses with them. Silk damping is not as significant in models of cosmological development which posit early isocurvature fluctuations (i.e. fluctuations which do not require a constant ratio of baryons and photons). In this case, increases in baryon density do not require a corresponding increases in <b>photon</b> density, and the lower the <b>photon</b> density, the less diffusion there would be: the less diffusion, the less damping. <b>Photon</b> diffusion is not dependent on {{the causes of the}} initial fluctuations in the density of the universe.|$|E

5000|$|A {{feature that}} also made Yardsellr {{different}} from eBay was {{the ability for}} users to make purchases with <b>Photons.</b> According to the Yardsellr Blog, <b>Photons</b> were like money; 100,000 <b>Photons</b> equaled $1 {{that could be used}} toward any Yardsellr purchase. Individuals could win <b>Photons,</b> up to 1 million a day, by looking for [...] "$" [...] signs, on what Yardsellr called a [...] "treasure hunt". Users could also gift <b>photons</b> to each other. When a purchase was made using <b>Photons,</b> the seller would still be paid the full price of the item. <b>Photons</b> depleted over time, so a user that did not use them fast would slowly lose them.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the quantum}} view of {{electromagnetic}} interactions, far-field effects are manifestations of real <b>photons,</b> whereas near-field effects {{are due to}} a mixture of real and virtual <b>photons.</b> Virtual <b>photons</b> composing near-field fluctuations and signals have effects that are of far shorter range than those of real <b>photons.</b>|$|R
5|$|A <b>photon</b> {{goes from}} one place and time to another place and time.|$|E
5|$|An {{electron}} emits or absorbs a <b>photon</b> at {{a certain}} place and time.|$|E
5|$|Each atomic orbital {{corresponds}} to a particular energy level of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a <b>photon</b> with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through spontaneous emission, an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a <b>photon.</b> These characteristic energy values, defined by {{the differences in the}} energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic spectral lines.|$|E
5000|$|The neutral pions [...] decay into <b>photons</b> [...] in {{a process}} [...] The <b>photons</b> {{produced}} form an electromagnetic cascade by creating more <b>photons,</b> protons, antiprotons, electrons and positrons.|$|R
50|$|Detection {{of signal}} <b>photons</b> at D0 does not {{directly}} yield any which-path information. Detection of idler <b>photons</b> at D3 or D4, which provide which-path information, means that no interference pattern {{can be observed in}} the jointly detected subset of signal <b>photons</b> at D0. Likewise, detection of idler <b>photons</b> at D1 or D2, which do not provide which-path information, means that interference patterns can be observed in the jointly detected subset of signal <b>photons</b> at D0.|$|R
25|$|X-ray {{detectors}} collect individual X-rays (<b>photons</b> of X-ray electromagnetic radiation) {{and count}} the number of <b>photons</b> collected (intensity), the energy (0.12 to 120 keV) of the <b>photons</b> collected, wavelength (~0.008 to 8nm), or how fast the <b>photons</b> are detected (counts per hour), to tell us about the object that is emitting them.|$|R
5|$|Each <b>photon</b> carries two {{distinct}} and independent forms of angular momentum of light.|$|E
5|$|Electrons jump between orbitals in a particle-like fashion. For example, if {{a single}} <b>photon</b> strikes the {{electron}}s, {{only a single}} electron changes states {{in response to the}} photon; see Electron properties.|$|E
5|$|In a flame test, {{sodium and}} its {{compounds}} glow yellow because the excited 3s electrons of sodium emit a <b>photon</b> when they fall from 3p to 3s; the wavelength of this <b>photon</b> corresponds to the D line at about 589.3nm. Spin-orbit interactions involving the electron in the 3p orbital split the D line into two, at 589.0 and 589.6nm; hyperfine structures involving both orbitals cause many more lines.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} waveguide-cavity coupled system {{to achieve the}} routing of <b>photons</b> by the phases of other <b>photons.</b> Our router has four input ports and four output ports. The {{transport}} of the coherent-state <b>photons</b> injected through any input port can be controlled by the phases of the coherent-state <b>photons</b> injected through other input ports. This control can be achieved when the mean numbers of the routed and control <b>photons</b> are small enough and require no additional control fields. Therefore, the all-optical routing of <b>photons</b> can be achieved at the single-photon level. Comment: Comments are welcome! 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
5000|$|At high laser {{intensity}} absorptions and stimulated {{emissions of}} <b>photons</b> are so frequent that the molecule cannot {{be regarded as}} a system separate from the laser field; the molecule is [...] "dressed" [...] in <b>photons</b> forming a single system. However, the number of <b>photons</b> in this system varies when <b>photons</b> are absorbed and emitted. Therefore, to plot the energy diagram of the dressed molecule, we need to repeat the energy curves at each number of <b>photons.</b> The number of <b>photons</b> is very large but only a few curve repetitions need to be considered in this very tall ladder, as shown in Fig. 1b.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of gamma <b>photons</b> the {{detection}} efficiency is more dependent upon the fill gas and gamma energy. Low energy <b>photons</b> will interact more with the fill gas than high energy <b>photons.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the {{prevailing}} Standard Model of physics, the <b>photon</b> {{is one of}} four gauge bosons in the electroweak interaction; the other three are denoted W+, W− and Z0 and are responsible for the weak interaction. Unlike the <b>photon,</b> these gauge bosons have mass, owing to a mechanism that breaks their SU(2) gauge symmetry. The unification of the <b>photon</b> with W and Z gauge bosons in the electroweak interaction was accomplished by Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg, for which they were awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in physics. Physicists continue to hypothesize grand unified theories that connect these four gauge bosons with the eight gluon gauge bosons of quantum chromodynamics; however, key predictions of these theories, such as proton decay, have not been observed experimentally.|$|E
5|$|Individual photons can be {{detected}} by several methods. The classic photomultiplier tube exploits the photoelectric effect: a <b>photon</b> of sufficient energy strikes a metal plate and knocks free an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying avalanche of electrons. Semiconductor charge-coupled device chips use a similar effect: an incident <b>photon</b> generates a charge on a microscopic capacitor that can {{be detected}}. Other detectors such as Geiger counters use the ability of photons to ionize gas molecules contained in the device, causing a detectable change of conductivity of the gas.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of the {{interaction}} between energetic photons and hadrons show that {{the interaction}} is much more intense than expected by the interaction of merely photons with the hadron's electric charge. Furthermore, the interaction of energetic photons with protons is similar to the interaction of photons with neutrons {{in spite of the fact}} that the electric charge structures of protons and neutrons are substantially different. A theory called Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) was developed to explain this effect. According to VMD, the <b>photon</b> is a superposition of the pure electromagnetic <b>photon</b> which interacts only with electric charges and vector meson. However, if experimentally probed at very short distances, the intrinsic structure of the <b>photon</b> is recognized as a flux of quark and gluon components, quasi-free according to asymptotic freedom in QCD and described by the <b>photon</b> structure function. A comprehensive comparison of data with theoretical predictions was presented in a review in 2000.|$|E
40|$|We {{have begun}} {{assembling}} apparatus allowing study of fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, via experiments involving single <b>photons.</b> As an initial step, we are assembling components for protection of fiber-optic-coupled detectors with high quantum efficiency. After alignment is completed, we will examine 405 nm <b>photons</b> {{passing through a}} BBO crystal. Rarely, single <b>photons</b> interacting with this crystal are emitted {{as a pair of}} entangled <b>photons</b> with a wavelength twice as long as the incident, blue <b>photons.</b> Only these “down-converted” <b>photons</b> can pass through filters we have added, and so only these 810 nm <b>photons</b> will be detected by our single-photon detectors. This system can be extended to run experiments exploring the non-local nature of quantum wavefunctions, e. g., the Grangier experiment, single-photon interference, and the Hardy-Bell experiment...|$|R
40|$|We {{report an}} {{experiment}} in which two-photon interference occurs between degenerate single <b>photons</b> that never meet. The two <b>photons</b> travel in opposite directions through our fibre-optic interferometer and interference occurs when the <b>photons</b> reach two different, spatially separated, 2 -by- 2 couplers at the same time. We show that this experiment {{is analogous to the}} conventional Franson-type entanglement experiment where the <b>photons</b> are entangled in position and time. We measure wavefunction overlaps for the two <b>photons</b> as high as 94 ± 3...|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{exponential}} reduction (with {{respect to}} distance) of ballistic <b>photons</b> in a scattering medium, often image processing techniques {{are applied to}} the raw captured ballistic images, to reconstruct high quality ones. The aim of ballistic imaging modalities is to reject non-ballistic <b>photons</b> and to retain ballistic <b>photons</b> carrying useful information. To perform this task, specific characteristics of ballistic <b>photons</b> vs. non-ballistic <b>photons</b> are used, such as time of flight through coherence gated imaging, collimation, wavefront propagation and polarization.|$|R
5|$|Rise of Mana was {{intended}} to reach a wide audience, gaining an attention only previously seen by Dawn of Mana in 2006. The concept of the main character switching between angelic and demonic form was suggested by Yagi. The original concept was to keep both characters in separate bodies, with the unoccupied character being controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. The team used the <b>Photon</b> Server middleware to develop the game's multiplayer component. The development team initially thought of creating custom middleware, but the rebuild needed {{would have taken a}} whole year, threatening the project's existence. In search of suitable middleware, the team contacted Fixer, who offered them the use of multiple options including <b>Photon</b> Server. Trying out <b>Photon</b> Server, all the problems faced by the developers were resolved within a two-month period, and the middleware's inbuilt security structure and specification match with the game persuaded the project's engineers to greenlight its use. Rise of Mana was the first Japanese game to use <b>Photon</b> Server. The team needed to create two different specifications for iOS and Android, as Android had higher graphical power. During the early development stage, the team {{thought it would be fun}} to re-create the multiplayer elements in Secret of Mana. The initial idea was to have multiplayer available in standard quests, but this took up too much operational space to be practical, so they reduced this to raid battles. Due to the use of <b>Photon</b> Server, additional player characters could be fully rendered rather than appearing as ghost-like transparent helpers.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} formulae for {{the energy}} and momentum of electromagnetic radiation can be re-expressed in terms of <b>photon</b> events. For example, the pressure of electromagnetic radiation on an object derives from the transfer of <b>photon</b> momentum per unit time and unit area to that object, since pressure is force per unit area and force is the change in momentum per unit time.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground state}} energy {{level of the}} {{electron}} in a hydrogen atom is −13.6eV, which is equivalent to an ultraviolet <b>photon</b> of roughly 91nm wavelength.|$|E
50|$|QUESS is {{the first}} {{spacecraft}} launched capable of generating entangled <b>photons</b> in space, although transmission of single <b>photons</b> via satellites has previously been demonstrated by reflecting <b>photons</b> generated at ground-based stations off orbiting satellites. While not generating fully entangled <b>photons,</b> correlated pairs of <b>photons</b> have been produced in space using a cubesat by the National University of Singapore and the University of Strathclyde. A German consortium has performed quantum measurements of optical signals from the geostationary Alphasat Laser Communication Terminal.|$|R
40|$|We {{report for}} the first time in an ancilla-free process a non-local {{entanglement}} between two single <b>photons</b> which do not meet. For our experiment we derive a simple and efficient method to entangle two single <b>photons</b> using post-selection technology. The <b>photons</b> are guided into an interferometer setup without the need for ancilla <b>photons</b> for projection into the Bell-states. After passing the output ports, the <b>photons</b> are analyzed using a bell state analyzer on each side. The experimental data clearly shows a non-local interaction between these <b>photons,</b> surpassing the limit set by the CHSH-inequality with an S-value of 2. 54 and 24 standard deviations.

50|$|Increasing mAs causes more <b>photons</b> (radiation) of the {{particular}} kVp energy, to be produced. This is helpful when larger parts are imaged, because they require more <b>photons.</b> The more <b>photons</b> {{you can get to}} pass through a particular tissue type (whose kVp is interacting at the cellular level) will result in a statistically increased amount of <b>photons</b> reaching the image receptor. The more <b>photons</b> that pass through a part, and reach the image receptor with pertinent information - the more useful the density is created on the resulting image. Conversely, lower mAs creates less <b>photons,</b> which will decrease density, but is helpful when you image smaller parts.|$|R
