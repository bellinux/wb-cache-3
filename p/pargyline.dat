5000|$|Amine oxidases are {{a family}} of enzymes that {{catalyze}} the oxidation of various endogenous amines, including histamine or dopamine. VAP-1 constitutes the copper dependent class of amine oxidases, such as lysyl oxidase or lysine demethylase, {{and is one of}} the four known in humans. The other class is flavin dependent such as monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B. VAP-1, in particular, catalyzes the oxidative conversion of primary amines (methylamine and aminoacetone) to aldehydes (formaldehyde and methylglyoxal) ammonium and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of copper and quinone cofactor. VAP-1 is primarily localized on the cell surface on the adipocyte plasma membrane. However, circulating VAP-1 has been shown to be the main source of SSAO in human serum. Serum VAP-1 originates from many tissues. VAP-1 has adhesive properties, functional monoamine oxidase activity, and possibly plays a role in glucose handling, leukocyte trafficking, and migration during inflammation. [...] This rise in metabolic products contributes to generating advanced glycation end-products and oxidative stress along with the monoamine detoxification in the organism. Like monoamine oxidase (MAO), VAP-1 can deaminate short-chain primary amines, but SSAO enzymes, including VAP-1, can tolerate several selective flavin-dependent MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitors like clorgiline, <b>pargyline,</b> and deprenyl, but are still sensitive to semicarbazide and other hydrazines, hydroxylamine and propargylamine. VAP-1 is found in the smooth muscle of blood vessels and various other tissues, and can mostly be found in two forms: tissue-bound and soluble isoforms. The tissue-bound SSAO is primarily located in the leukocytes, adipocytes, and the endothelium of highly vascularized tissues, including the kidney, liver, and gonads. Thus, this form participates in cellular differentiation, deposition of the ECM (extracellular matrix) in smooth muscle cells, lipid trafficking in adipocytes and control of muscular tone, by mechanisms that are not completely understood. The soluble form, which is commonly known as VAP-1, is a proinflammatory protein derived from shedding of the transmembrane protein. It is highly expressed on the endothelium of the lung and trachea, and absent from leukocytes and epithelial cells. It moderates leukocyte recruitment, is both an adhesion molecule and a primary amine oxidase, and plays a role in clinical disease.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Chemotherapy {{is one of}} the {{therapeutic}} strategies that has been used for the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation in several types of cancer, including prostate cancer. Although monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, phytoestrogen and antioxidants used in chemotherapy have been systematically studied, their effects on cancer cell growth remain to be fully understood. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects of the MAO inhibitors, <b>pargyline</b> and tranylcypromine on cell survival in human prostate carcinoma (LNCaP-LN 3) cells. After treating LNCaP-LN 3 cells with <b>pargyline</b> or tran-ylcypromine, we examined cell proliferation, cell cycle pattern, apoptosis and the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes. The proliferation of cells exposed to <b>pargyline</b> decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while tranylcypromine-treated cells showed the opposite results. Treatment with <b>pargyline</b> significantly induced cell cycle arrest at the G 1 phase compared to the control and tranylcypromine-treated cells. In addition, <b>pargyline</b> induced an increase in the cell death rate by promoting apoptosis; however, tranylcypromine had no effect on LNCaP-LN 3 cells.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to explore the {{contribution}} of the metabolites of <b>pargyline</b> towards the in vivo inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO), the effects of <b>pargyline</b> and its major metabolites on the production and metabolism of a number of biogenic amines were studied in rats. The administration of <b>pargyline</b> gave rise to three major ethyl acetate extractable metabolites: benzylamine, N-methylbenzylamine and N-propargylbenzylamine (NPB). Only NPB demonstrated in vivo monoamine oxidase inhibitory properties at an acute dose of 30 mg kg- 1. The acute effects of <b>pargyline,</b> NPB, and deprenyl on urine and brain concentrations of a number of biogenic amines (phenylethylamine (PEA), m- and p-tyramine, noradrenaline (NA), dopamine, and 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) and their metabolites were evaluated. Increased urine and brain concentrations of PEA were considered to represent in vivo inhibition of type B MAO while decreased concentrations of NA and 5 -HT metabolites were regarded as indicators of an in vivo inhibition of MAO type A. NPB, like deprenyl and <b>pargyline,</b> significantly increased urine and brain PEA while only <b>pargyline</b> reduced 5 -HT metabolism, suggesting that the metabolism of <b>pargyline</b> to NPB may contribute towards the MAO type B inhibitory effects of <b>pargyline</b> in vivo. Since the therapeutic benefits of MAO inhibitors in clinical practice usually require some period of chronic treatment, the chronic effects of repeated 14 daily doses of the above MAO inhibitors on central and peripheral biogenic amines were evaluated at the following times: during treatment, one day and five days after termination of treatment. The biochemical changes observed during the course of chronic NPB, <b>pargyline</b> and deprenyl treatments generally follow the expected in vitro characteristics of these drugs, but the detailed changes observed suggest clear differences. For example, the in vivo effect of <b>pargyline</b> on urine 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid excretion was considerably weaker than its effect on the excretion of NA and dopamine metabolites. These changes are opposite to the in vitro effects of <b>pargyline</b> on 5 -HT, dopamine and NA oxidative deamination. Inhibitions of the metabolism of all the amines studied were clearly observed during chronic MAOI treatments, but these effects were less evident five days after the end of treatment, suggesting an almost normal metabolism of biogenic amines. It is concluded that while MAO inhibitors may be the primary compound responsible for MAO inhibition, the effects of their metabolites in some cases may also play equally important roles in the regulation of monoamines both in the periphery and the brain.

MAO-B inhibitor <b>pargyline</b> (15 mg/kg) was systemically administered before neurotoxin administration. The first MPTP dose induced an increase in dialysate dopamine and a decrease of DOPAC levels in striatal dialysate. After the first neurotoxin administration, increases in striatal glucose, lactate, pyruvate, lactate/pyruvate (L/P) and lactate/glucose (L/G) ratios were observed. Subsequent MPTP administrations showed a progressive reduction of dopamine, glucose and pyruvate levels with a concomitant further increase in lactate levels and L/P and L/G ratios.

J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 164 : 185 - 190, 1968. Current evidence suggests that the 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) present in the spinal cord is localized in the terminals of bulbo-spinal neurons and that the actions of 5 -hydroxytryptophan (5 -HTP), l-tryptophan and <b>pargyline</b> on spinal neuronal activity result from intraneuronal accumulations of 5 -HT which overflows to activate receptors.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} whereby <b>pargyline,</b> {{succinic acid}} and absorbic acid protect against hyperbaric oxygen convulsions, pulmonary damage and mortality following hyperbaric oxygen exposure were investigated {{in relation to}} the effects of these agents on hyperbaric oxygen-induced alterations in brain gamma-aminobutyric acid and ammonia metabolism. Exposure to hyperbaric oxygen (60 pounds per square inch, gauge pressure) produced convulsions, post-exposure lethality and elevation in lung weight, lung water content and lung hemoglobin content. <b>Pargyline,</b> succinic acid and ascorbic acid provided partial production against all of the above aspects of toxicity. Comparison of the doses of <b>pargyline,</b> succinic acid and ascorbic acid that provided maximal protection against hyperbaric oxygen convulsions showed that all three agents were approximately equal, in the doses used, with respect to their effectiveness in decreasing the incidence of hyperbaric oxygen convulsions and increasing the latency to their onset. Pargylune and succinic acid were approximately equal, in the doses used, in their ability to reduce post-exposure lethality and hyperbaric oxygen-induced increased in lung weight, water content and hemoglobin content. Ascorbic acid was less effective in its ability to reduce the above changes induced by hyperbaric oxygen exposure. Hyperbaric oxygen decreased brain gamma-aminobutyric acid levels. This decrease was due to inhibition of glutamic acid decarboxylase without any effect on gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase activity. Both <b>pargyline</b> and succinic acide increased brain gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in room air-exposed mice and prevented the decrease in brain gamma-aminobutyric acid produced by hyperbaric oxygen exposure. <b>Pargyline</b> increased gamma-aminobutyric acid levels by inhibiting gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase activity in room air- and hyperbaric oxygen-exposed mice. Succinic acid increased the activity of both glutamic acid decarboxylase and gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase, glutamic acid decarboxylase to a greater degree than gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase. Glutamic acid decarboxylase activity was still slightly increased in mice exposed to hyperbaric oxygen. These alterations in enzyme activity were responsible for the ability of <b>pargyline</b> and succinic acid to increase brain gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in room air-exposed mice and to prevent the hyperbaric oxygen-induced decrease in brain gamma-aminobutyric acid in animals exposed to hyperbaric oxygen. There was a significant correlation between hyperbaric oxygen seizure susceptibility and brain gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in <b>pargyline</b> - or succunic acid – treated mice. In pargyline- or succinic acid-treated mice there was a dose-response relationship between amount of drug administered and degree of elevation in brain gamma-aminobutyric acid. Ascorbic acid had no effect on brain gamma-aminobutyric acid levels nor did it prevent the hyperbaric oxygen-induced decrease in brain gamma-aminobutyric acid. Ascorbic acid treatment had no effect on glutamic acid decarboxylase or gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase activities nor did it prevent the hyperbaric oxygen-induced decrease in glutamic acid decarboxylase activity. Hyperbaric oxygen exposure increased brain ammonia levels and decreased brain glutamine levels. All three agents reduced these hyperbaric oxygen-induced alterations. There was a correlation between brain ammonia levels and hyperbaric oxygen seizure susceptibility in mice treated with <b>pargyline,</b> succinic acid or ascorbic acid. The same was true for glutamine levels and hyperbaric oxygen seizure susceptibility. These results demonstrate that decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid levels and increased ammonia levels in the brain are involved in the etiology of hyperbaric oxygen toxicity. The effectiveness of the three agents tested as protective agents against hyperbaric oxygen toxicity appears related to their ability to alter the hyperbaric oxygen-induced changes in brain ammonia and gamma-aminobutyric acid metabolism.

Studies in freely moving rats not pretreated with <b>pargyline</b> are not available. This study was intended to fill this gap {{by the use of}} in vivo microdialysis in freely moving rats. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with microdialysis probes in the NAc shell and core and medial prefrontal cortex (PFCX). The next day, rats were administered intravenously with two or three doses of APs, and dialysate DA was monitored in 10 -min samples. Some rats were pretreated with <b>pargyline</b> (75 mg/kg i. p.) and after 1 h were given clozapine or risperidone. RESULTS: Clozapine, risperidone, quetiapine, raclopride, sulpiride and amisulpride increased DA preferentially in the NAc shell. Such preferential effect on shell DA was not observed after haloperidol, chlorpromazine and olanzapine. In contrast to voltammetric studies, a preferential effect on NAc core DA was not observed after any dose of AP. <b>Pargyline</b> pretreatment did not reduce but actually amplified the preferential effect of clozapine and risperidone on NAc shell DA. CONCLUSIONS: Apart from raclopride and olanzapine, the APs with lower extrapyramidal effects could be distinguished from typical APs {{on the basis of their}} ability to preferentially stimulate DA transmission in the NAc shell. There was no relationship between stimulation of PFCX DA and atypical APs profile. The differences between this study and voltammetry studies were not attributable to <b>pargyline</b> pretreatment...|$|E

The effect of several monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors was investigated on spinal neuronal potentials recorded from an L 7 ventral root and evoked by stimulation of an L 7 dorsal root. Within 3 to 4 hr after the injection of the MAO inhibitors, <b>pargyline,</b> nialamide, tranylcypromine and a-ethyltryptamine, the monosynaptic spike height was selectively increased whereas the polysynaptic potentials remained unchanged. The {{increase in the}} monosynaptic spike height was statistically significant with each compound. The following results indicated that this action was associated with MAO inhibition and the accumulation of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT). Four hours after the injection of <b>pargyline,</b> cord levels of 5 -HT and norepinephrine (NE) were increased by 70 and 17 %, respectively. Four hours after pretreatment with a MAO inhibitor the actions of 5 -hydroxytryptophan (5 -HTP) and dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) on spinal reflexes were strongly potentiated. Chronic reserpine treatment did not prevent the effects of <b>pargyline</b> or 5 -HTP but strongly de...|$|E

Striatal levels of 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid were significantly reduced shortly after intravenous administration, and returned to normal values after a few hours.

40|$|Clorgyline and Lilly 51641, {{given at}} dose levels that {{inhibited}} selectively brain type A monoamine oxidase (MAO), significantly lowered {{the incidence of}} stereotyped jumping produced by naloxone in mice rendered dependent on morphine by subcutaneous implantation of a pellet of the drug. In contrast, selective inhibition of brain type B MAO by deprenyl or <b>pargyline,</b> or nonspecific inhibition of both type A and type B MAO by high doses of Lilly 51641 or <b>pargyline</b> did not modify the abstinence syndrome. Tolerance to the analgesic effect of morphine was unchanged regardless of the enzyme form blocked. The attenuation of withdrawal jumping by low doses of clorgyline or Lilly 51641 does not seem related to changes in brain dopamine, which {{was found to be}} deaminated by both enzyme types. The results suggest the possible implication of different and interrelated neurochemical systems in the development of morphine dependence in mice. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In rat {{cerebral}} cortex, serotonin (5 -HT) stimulates phosphoino-sitide turnover with an ECso Of 1 zM in {{the presence}} of <b>pargyline.</b> The ECso is 1 6 -fold higher in the absence of <b>pargyline.</b> Selective S 2 antagonists inhibit 5 -HT-stimulated phosphoinositide turn-over. Schild analysis of the blockade by ketanserin of the 5 -HT effect gives an estimated Kd of ketanserin for the phosphoinosi-tide-linked receptor of 1 1. 7 nM, which agrees with the Kd (3. 5 nM) of [3 H]ketanserin for the S site. Furthermore, MK- 21 2, 5 -HT and 5 -fluorotryptamine stimulate phosphoinositide turnover with potencies that resemble their potencies at the S but not the S 1 binding site. Of 1 1 agonists tested, the tryptamine deny-atives tend to be more efficacious than the piperazine derivatives.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of essential hypertension still {{consists of the}} judicious combination {{of two or more}} agents. The chemical nature, pharmacology, side effects and relative merits of two groups of drugs are reviewed: (1) agents interfering with the synthesis, storage and release of endogenous catecholamines and (2) oral diuretic agents. Rauwolfia compounds, bretylium tosylate, guanethidine, alpha-methyldopa and <b>pargyline</b> hydrochloride comprise the first group; thiazide derivatives, phthalimidine compounds and spironolactones constitute the second. Guanethidine is the most potent and most extensively used agent in the second group. While not yet fully assessed, alpha-methyldopa and <b>pargyline</b> hydrochloride are useful in selected cases. The intrinsic hypotensive properties of oral diuretics, their low incidence of side effects and their ability to potentiate the more potent agents make them useful adjuncts in the long-term {{treatment of}} hypertension. Attention is drawn to the potential diabetogenic and hyperuricemic effects of the thiazides and phthalimidine compounds...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} {{examined}} dopamine-immunoreactive neuronal structures using immunohistochemistry {{in conjunction with}} an anti-dopamine antiserum, following injection of l- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) with or without an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (<b>Pargyline)</b> in the cat brain. L-DOPA injection {{made it possible to}} detect dopamine immunoreactivity in presumptive serotonergic and noradrenergic cell bodies and axons. Weak to moderate dopamine immunoreactivity was observed in non-aminergic cells (possibly so-called "D" cells containing aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC)) in several hypothalamic, midbrain, pontine and medullary nuclei. Intense dopamine immunoreactivity became visible in a large number of cells and axons (possibly containing AADC) with wide distribution in the brain following administration of L-DOPA with <b>Pargyline.</b> AADC is most likely active in cells and axons that take up L-DOPA, where it decarboxylates the L-DOPA to dopamine. However, newly synthesized dopamine in such cells is rapidly oxidized by monoamine oxidase...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} {{to determine the effect}} of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors on the release and the metabolism of noradrenaline in the canine saphenous vein. Helical strips were incubated with 3 H-noradrenaline and mounted for superfusion and measurement of the efflux of labelled transmitter and its metabolites; in certain experiments the tissue content of 3 H-noradrenaline and its metabolites was also determined. The MAO-A inhibitor clorgyline, and the non-specific inhibitor <b>pargyline,</b> but not the MAO-B inhibitor deprenyl decreased the appearance of deaminated and O-methylated deaminated metabolites under basal conditions and during electrical stimulation. The MAO-A and the non-specific MAO inhibitor did not decrease the efflux of VMA to the same extent as that of the other deaminated metabolites. During superfusion with etidocaine, an agent causing increased leakage of stored transmitter, clorgyline abolished the appearance of DOPEG. Addition of semicarbazide in preparations treated with <b>pargyline</b> did not affect the efflux of deaminated and O-methylated deaminated metabolites. From the measurement of tissue VMA, it appeared that the efflux of VMA poorly reflects quick changes in the rate of its formation but that formation is abolished by pretreatment with <b>pargyline.</b> These experiments indicate that in the canine saphenous vein: (1) DOPEG is formed mainly in intraneuronal sites, while DOMA, MOPEG and VMA are formed extraneuronally; (2) VMA is retained in the tissue after its formation; and (3) the only subtype of MAO involved in the metabolism of 3 H-noradrenaline released from adrenergic nerve endings can be classified as MAO-A. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{brains of}} four adult cats treated with <b>pargyline</b> (a nonhydrazide monoaminoxidase inhibitor) were {{examined}} {{at both the}} light and electron microscopic levels. Formation of typical mature cilia with the 9 + 2 pattern was observed in neural cells in the following areas: habenula nuclei, interpeduncular nuclei, hippocampus, mammillary bodies, thalamus, and caudate nucleus. The most marked ciliation occurs in the habenula nuclei. In general, glial cells greatly predominate {{in the formation of}} cilia. It is not clear whether ciliation in the central nervous system is the direct result of <b>pargyline</b> or if it occurs indirectly as a result of inhibition of monoaminoxidase. These findings are compared with the serotonin effect on ciliation in the embryogenesis of lower forms. It is suggested that pharmacological stimulation of centriolar reproduction without subsequent mitosis may lead to ciliary formation. The presence of a single cilium in cells which are not normally ciliated has been reported occasionally. Taxi (28) observed cilia in neurons of th...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} various dopaminergic drug {{treatments}} on the in vivo regional brain distribution of high-affinity radioligands ([11 C]dihydrotetrabenazine and [11 C]methoxytetrabenazine) for the rat brain vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT 2) were determined. Acute treatments with reserpine (2 mg/kg i. p.), tetrabenazine (10 mg/kg i. v.) or related benzoisoquinolines significantly reduced radiotracer binding in vivo. In contrast, radiotracer distributions remained unchanged after treatments with other dopaminergic drugs, whether given by single injection (haloperidol, 1 mg/kg i. p., <b>pargyline</b> 80 mg/kg), repeatedly (<b>pargyline,</b> 80 mg/kg s. c., 14 days), or by continuous infusion (deprenyl, 10 mg/kg/day, 5 days; L-DOPA methyl ester 100 mg/kg/day, 5 days). Repeated injections of tetrabenazine (5 mg/kg i. p., twice daily, 3 days) did not alter in vivo radioligand binding measured after allowing drug washout from the brain. These studies support the proposal that in vivo PET imaging of VMAT 2 radioligands {{in patients with}} extrapyramidal movement disorders will not be affected by concurrent use of L-DOPA or deprenyl...|$|E
