5|$|The Seahawks {{played their}} home {{games at the}} Kingdome from their 1976 inaugural season until 1999. In 1995 a {{proposal}} was made to issue county bonds to fund a remodeling project of the facility. The proposal failed, and as a result, Seahawks' owner Ken Behring threatened to sell or move the team. In 1997 local billionaire Paul Allen pledged to acquire the team if a new stadium could be built {{and said that the}} team could not be profitable until they left the Kingdome. He asked the state legislature to hold a special statewide referendum on a proposal to finance a new stadium. Allen also agreed to cover any cost overruns. With Allen agreeing to pay the $4million cost, the legislature agreed. The vote was scheduled to be held in June 1997 but in May a Seattle resident filed a lawsuit that claimed the legislature did not have authority to call for such a vote, since it would be paid for by a private party who could gain from the result. The case was delayed until after the vote. The proposal was pitched to voters as providing both a new home for the Seahawks and a venue for top-level soccer. It passed on June 17, 1997, with 820,364 (51.1%) in favor and 783,584 against. The vote was close in Seattle, but it received 60% approval in Seattle's northern and eastern suburbs. The public funding was unpopular farther away in the eastern portion of the state. In October, a Thurston County Superior Court judge ruled that the legislature acted properly and in the public's interest, and he dismissed the <b>pending</b> <b>lawsuit.</b> The Washington Supreme Court upheld the decision that December.|$|E
5|$|Bank Markazi v. Peterson, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court {{case that}} found that a law which only applied to a {{specific}} case, identified by docket number, and eliminated all of the defenses one party had raised does not violate {{the separation of powers}} in the United States Constitution between the legislative (Congress) and judicial branches of government. The plaintiffs in the trial court, respondents in the Supreme Court, were several parties who had obtained judgments against Iran for its role in supporting state-sponsored terrorism, particularly the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings and 1996 Khobar Towers bombing, and sought execution against a bank account in New York held, through European intermediaries, on behalf of Bank Markazi, the state-owned Central Bank of Iran. The initial plaintiffs obtained court orders preventing the transfer of funds from the account in 2008 and initiated their lawsuit in 2010. Bank Markazi raised several defenses against the execution against the account, including that the account was not an asset of the bank, but rather an asset of its European intermediary, under both New York state property law and ยง201(a) of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. In response to concerns that existing laws were insufficient for the account to be used to settle the judgments, Congress included a section within a 2012 bill, codified after enactment as 22 U.S.C. ยง8772, that identified the <b>pending</b> <b>lawsuit</b> by docket number, applied only to the assets in the identified case, and essentially abrogated every legal basis available to Bank Markazi to prevent the plaintiffs from executing their claims against the account. Bank Markazi then argued that ยง8772 was an unconstitutional breach of the separation of power between the legislative and judicial branches of government, because it effectively directed a particular result in a single case without changing the generally applicable law. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and, on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit both upheld the constitutionality of ยง8772 and cleared the way for the plaintiffs to execute their judgments against the account, which held about $1.75billion in cash.|$|E
25|$|In January 2008, the Hastings Town Board {{denied a}} zoning change {{that would have}} allowed Syracuse Suburban Airport to reopen. The town contends the grandfathered use as an airport expired because the {{previous}} owner sold the property in 2004 and it hasn't been used as an airport since that time. However, the current owners have a <b>pending</b> <b>lawsuit</b> against the Hastings Zoning Board of Appeals, which will be heard in the New York State Supreme Court.|$|E

25|$|A <b>pending</b> <b>lawsuit</b> kept Wells {{away from}} the studio for several months, as she and Gordy {{brokered}} the contract details, with Wells fighting to gain {{a larger share of}} the royalties she'd had earned during her tenure with Motown. Finally, Wells invoked a clause that allowed her to leave the label, advising the court that her original contract was invalid, as she had signed while she was still a minor. Wells won her lawsuit and was awarded a settlement, leaving Motown officially in early 1965, whereupon she accepted a lucrative ($200,000) contract with 20th Century Fox Records.|$|E
500|$|The {{fortunes}} of Randolph {{declined in the}} later 1840s and the 1850s due to many factors, starting shortly after {{the establishment of the}} town. Five years after the settlement was founded, a dispute over the ownership of the land the town was established on, arose over a faulty land title with land owner Ann Grambelling from New York. Until 1835, the <b>pending</b> <b>lawsuit</b> [...] "prevented the growth of population" [...] in and around Randolph. The residents of the community bought back the land their town was founded on for $8,000 in a settlement.|$|E
2500|$|The United States Patent and Trademark Office {{suspended}} Blizzard's {{application for}} a trademark for Overwatch due to [...] "a likelihood of confusion" [...] with a previously registered trademark by Innovis Labs.

2500|$|Upon {{rejection}} by the Board of major proposed edits, a jubilant Thillai Kumaran, then President of FeTNA, dismissed the <b>pending</b> <b>lawsuit</b> by the Hindu organizations. [...] "Threats of legal action are {{a clear sign}} of desperation {{on the part of}} the Sangh organizations; these organizations are perhaps not aware that the Board deals with dozens of lawsuits at any given time and cannot be cowed by such threats.". Thillai Kumaran, a concerned parent, mentioned his lower-caste origins during his testimony, [...] mentioned that his son, who attend Middle School in California, did not feel insulted by the textbook's contents on Hinduism.|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{began its}} {{analysis}} by summarizing the legal history preceding {{the enactment of}} SLUSA. [...] In 1942, [...] the Securities Exchange Commission promulgated SEC Rule 10b-5, which broadly prohibits any [...] "deceptive device" [...] or fraud [...] "in connection with the purchase or sale of securities." [...] Courts recognized a private cause of action under Rule 10b-5 since 1946 {{despite the lack of}} explicit language to this effect. [...] However, the majority of courts limited this to plaintiffs asserting purchaser or seller claims, rather than holder claims. [...] The Supreme Court adopted this limitation in Blue Chip Stamps, despite the broad language in 10b-5 and despite the lack of a similar limitation upon government enforcement of the Rule. [...] The Court found a policy for this limit in the [...] "vexatiousness" [...] that Rule 10b-5 litigation represented, which provided for substantial settlements in even weak cases due to the interference a <b>pending</b> <b>lawsuit</b> caused with normal business.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{statutory}} college, the New York State College of Forestry, {{was founded}} at Cornell in 1898, {{only to be}} closed in 1903 when outcry over a <b>pending</b> <b>lawsuit</b> led Gov. Odell to veto the appropriations bill that provided funding. However, forestry education was continued at Cornell {{as part of the}} College of Agriculture. The College of Forestry was later reestablished at Syracuse University in 1911. Two of Cornell's current statutory colleges [...] the NYS College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the NYS College of Human Ecology [...] existed as non-state-supported colleges (as the College of Agriculture and the School of Home Economics, respectively) before state legislation was enacted to make each a state-supported entity. The NYS College of Human Ecology and the NYS College of Veterinary Medicine trace their origins to Cornell's agriculture college. However, the College of Veterinary Medicine was actually the first statutory college in New York. The Hotel School started in 1922 as a department within Home Economics, but became a separate, endowed college in 1954.|$|E
