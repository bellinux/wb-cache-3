40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Master Thesis {{is to create an}} {{evaluation}} system of undeveloped <b>building</b> <b>land,</b> which will allow objective evaluation of the market value of <b>building</b> <b>land.</b> We have set ourselves the following research hypothesis: the generalized market value of <b>building</b> <b>land,</b> estimated {{to meet the needs of}} mass valuation, is not applicable to individual valuation of <b>building</b> <b>lands</b> in Slovenia, because it does not reflect the situation on the market of <b>building</b> <b>land.</b> Therefore, in Slovenia we need to establish a system of an individual valuation of <b>building</b> <b>land,</b> based on the market standard ground values of <b>building</b> <b>land.</b> For the purposes of research, we obtained, processed and analyzed data on completed transactions with <b>building</b> <b>land</b> on the applied area of the Municipality of Maribor in the period from 2007 to the end of 2014. We adjusted the acquired data on completed transactions on 31 12 2014 and eliminated the differences, caussed by different time of sale. We have created value zones by using the modified method of leaders. The adequacy of formed zones has been checked by comparing the coefficients of variation and execution of t-tests with which we verified differences of created zones. We have determined the reference <b>building</b> <b>land,</b> which has properties that are on the applied area most represented. Range of factors that affect the value of <b>building</b> <b>land</b> has been determined based on a survey of the professional public. With multiple regression analysis, we have checked which factors in each zone affected the value of <b>building</b> <b>land.</b> Standard ground values have been determined by a statistical method and its suitability was checked by intersubjective methods. In order to verify the adequacy of zones, the "Zielbaum" method or branched diagram after Aurnhammer procedure has been used. We have found that the standard ground value is properly defined by using the statistical methods. We have designed the coefficients for the conversion for variable area of <b>building</b> <b>land</b> in the value zone three. The survey has shown that the existing system of individual evaluation does not prohibit indirect valuation through market comparisons, which may also include the evaluation with the help of market standard ground values. It turns out that the derived market standard ground values are appropriate basis for carrying out individual evaluations of <b>building</b> <b>land.</b> We have found out that derived standard ground values in the applied area of Municipality of Maribor differ from the generalized market values...|$|R
40|$|This {{graduated}} thesis {{concerns the}} agricultural and undeveloped <b>building</b> <b>land</b> market in Slovenia between 2007 and 2009. The current legislation on real estate, in particular on land market and mass appraisal, is shortly presented. The real estate database, mass appraisal models for agricultural and undeveloped <b>building</b> <b>land,</b> which is managed by The Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic of Slovenia, are presented. The {{real estate market}} data are primary data {{for the analysis of}} the agricultural and undeveloped <b>building</b> <b>land</b> market activity. The main emphasis of the thesis is on the analysis of location impact on the market activity and price of the agricultural and undeveloped <b>building</b> <b>land.</b> Location is defined as the accessibility (travel time) to the centre at different levels (state – capital city Ljubljana, regional – centres of developed regions, local – centres of administrative units, municipalities and settlements). We confirmed the hypothesis, that location has an impact on the activity and price of the agricultural and undeveloped <b>building</b> <b>land</b> market. It has been shown, that accessibility to the capital city has the strongest impact on the agricultural and undeveloped <b>building</b> <b>land</b> market. In further analyses of mass appraisal models we found out that land values, calculated based on mass appraisal models for agricultural and undeveloped <b>building</b> <b>land,</b> do not consider location in the form of accessibility to the centres at different levels...|$|R

We outline a theoretical model that ties a household's willingness to pay for <b>building</b> <b>land</b> to the inter-temporal value of employment. Using data for NUTS~ 3 regions the theoretically derived impact of labor market variables and other influences is investigated. We show that spatial dependence through spatially lagged variables plays a crucial role. According to our findings, the variation {{in the price of}} <b>building</b> <b>land</b> can be explained reasonably well if one adequately takes into account the specific patterns of spatial interaction...|$|R

40|$|This article surveys {{possibilities}} {{of determining the}} value of <b>building</b> <b>land</b> as base for property taxes, done by municipalities. It is shown that reform is needed. Application of ad valorem taxation could be fairer. In such taxation owners of more valuable <b>building</b> <b>land</b> should pay proportionally larger taxes. Ad valorem taxation will offer a stable source of revenue with a potentially broad and expanding tax base for governments. It will provide {{the benefit of a}} more equitable distribution on taxes, as well as greater fiscal transparency and accountability. Administratively easy determination of real estate value is essential. Price maps of <b>building</b> <b>land,</b> administrated by municipalities, could be a solution...|$|R

The graduation thesis consists of two parts: The first part brings analysis of acts and presents <b>building</b> <b>land</b> infrastructure in the regions of regulation. In the second part, <b>building</b> <b>land</b> development fee, method of calculation, and costs which affect the calculation are presented. It has been stated {{that the costs of}} <b>building</b> <b>land</b> infrastructure depend on the rate of land infrastructure, on the level of difficulty of the land and on the value of real estates. All these factors can change the amount of the costs of <b>building</b> <b>land</b> infrastructure within the area of only a few kilometres. Due to high costs, investors do not decide to build on such areas and thus no land infrastructure has been built for several years, and the areas have remained uninhabited...|$|R

In 2004, both municipalities accepted an ordinance about changes and completions the spatial components of long-term and medium-term social plan, in 2011 the municipality Sodražica accepted its municipal spatial plan, while the municipality Loški Potok accepted its municipal spatial plan in 2010. In the framework of the discussed spatial planning documents is presented the basic landuse in both municipalities, detailed landuse for selected settlements and changes in surfaces of areas of individual categories of basic and detailed land use between the discussed spatial planning documents of each municipality. In the end are, for the discussed spatial planning documents, also presented proportions of surfaces of individual categories of basic landuse per inhabitant in the municipality, as well as proportions of surfaces of individual categories of <b>building</b> <b>land</b> per inhabitant in selected settlements. Final results show an increase in areas of <b>building</b> <b>land</b> in both municipalities, also areas of <b>building</b> <b>land</b> increased in settlements Sodražica and Jelovec in the municipality Sodražica, while areas of <b>building</b> <b>land</b> in settlements Hrib-Loški Potok, Retje, Srednja vas, Šegova vas and Travnik of the municipality Loški Potok have decreased.

40|$|The master's thesis {{deals with}} site {{development}} work; {{the relationship between}} costs of municipal infrastructure (C), public utilities charge (PU) and the enlargement of <b>building</b> <b>land</b> value (EV) due to the municipal infrastructure. With the intention to build, the <b>building</b> <b>land</b> has to be developed, which means municipal infrastructure has to be provided and the public utilities charge settled as well. The municipal infrastructure represents a considerable cost for the investors. Public utilities charge is a contribution of the investor to all costs of municipal infrastructure. We assume therefore that the public utilities charge is smaller than the construction costs of the municipal infrastructure. We assume as well that the <b>building</b> <b>land</b> value grows with the site development work but {{for less than the}} amount of costs of its municipal infrastructure and public utilities charge which means that municipal infrastructure contributes to the <b>building</b> <b>land</b> value less than the costs of infrastructure and public utilities amount to. The master's thesis demonstrates how big the costs are included in the site development work. It shows the difference in the value of developed and undeveloped <b>building</b> <b>land</b> on the estate market. It also represents the calculation and assessment of public utilities charge. In the practical part of the thesis all three parameters have been calculated, i. e. costs of municipal infrastructure, public utilities charge and contribution (of the municipal infrastructure) to the <b>building</b> <b>land</b> value for eight (8) areas in the Savinjska region intended for the site development work. The analysis of the parameters and their interacting comparison has been made, together with the establishment of causes for the results of the comparison. The thesis finds out the relations between the three changing parameters on the basis of practical examples. It was established that the enlargement of <b>building</b> <b>land</b> value due to the municipal infrastructure is in most cases higher than the costs of municipal infrastructure and the amount of public utilities charge, therefore the hypotheses have not been fully confirmed...|$|R

Another big issue is the lack of the developed <b>land</b> and <b>building</b> but not built on land data which represent vital spatial potential and have the key role in land policy.
