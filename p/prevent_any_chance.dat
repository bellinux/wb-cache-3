5|$|The FNLC invaded Shaba {{again on}} 11 May 1978, {{capturing}} Kolwezi in two days. While the Carter Administration had accepted Cuba's insistence on its non-involvement in Shaba I, and therefore did not stand with Mobutu, the U.S. government now accused Castro of complicity. This time, when Mobutu appealed for foreign assistance, the U.S. government {{worked with the}} French and Belgian militaries to beat back the invasion, the first military cooperation between France and the United States since the Vietnam War. The French Foreign Legion took back Kolwezi after a seven-day battle and airlifted 2,250 European citizens to Belgium, but not before the FNLC massacred 80 Europeans and 200 Africans. In one instance, the FNLC killed 34 European civilians who had hidden in a room. The FNLC retreated to Zambia, vowing to return to Angola. The Zairean army then forcibly evicted civilians along Shaba's border with Angola. Mobutu, wanting to <b>prevent</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of another invasion, ordered his troops to shoot on sight.|$|E
2500|$|Because of his {{objection}} to military refusal and violence, Eitam was a negotiator between the opposers {{to the plan}} and Israeli security forces. He arranged a massive weapons recall in all the settlement due to be removed, in order to <b>prevent</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of bullets being fired by accident or {{the heat of the}} moment. He declared that the settlers would not use violence against Israeli security officers. [...] Eitam also insisted that the removal forces would be unarmed. He explained his actions: ...|$|E
2500|$|FAA Corsairs {{originally}} {{fought in}} a camouflage scheme with a Dark Slate Grey/Extra Dark Sea Grey disruptive pattern {{on top and}} Sky undersides, but were later painted overall dark blue. As it had become imperative for all Allied aircraft in the Pacific Theater of World War II to abandon all use of any [...] "red devices" [...] in their national insignia — to <b>prevent</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of misidentification with Japanese military aircraft, all of which bore the circular, all-red Hinomaru insignia (often nicknamed a [...] "meatball" [...] by Allied aircrew) that is still in use to this day, the main Allied force in the Pacific, the United States, had all areas of red color removed [...] (specifically removing the red center to the roundel) and removed any sort of national fin/rudder markings, which at that time had seven horizontal red stripes, from the American national aircraft insignia scheme by May 6, 1942. The British did likewise around the same timeframe, starting with a simple paintover with white paint, of their [...] "Type C" [...] roundel's red center, at {{about the time the}} U.S. Navy removed the red-center from their roundel. Later, a shade of slate gray center color replaced the white color on the earlier roundel. [...] When the Americans starting using the added white [...] "bars" [...] to either side of their blue/white star roundel on June 28, 1943; SEAC British Corsairs, most all of which still used the earlier blue/white Type C roundel with the red center removed, added similar white [...] "bars" [...] to either side of their blue-white roundels to emulate the Americans.|$|E

25|$|The MPF {{asked that}} the Munduruku Indians and the {{directly}} affected ribeirinhos communities first be consulted, {{as required by the}} International Labor Organization's Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989, to which Brazil subscribed in 2002. The MPF stated that the armed operation violated human rights, <b>prevented</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of dialog in good faith and would tend to create confrontation.|$|R
50|$|However, the Raiders {{completely}} {{took over}} the rest of the game, <b>preventing</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of a Washington comeback. On the ensuing drive, Washington defensive back Darrell Green was called for a 38-yard pass interference penalty while trying to cover Raiders receiver Malcolm Barnwell, setting up running back Marcus Allen's 5-yard touchdown run 7 plays later to make the score 28-9.|$|R

25|$|Nagel's replacement, Mike Giddings {{posted a}} record of 9–12 (.429) during the 1966 and 1967 seasons before resigning. Giddings had {{previously}} been an assistant coach at USC under legendary head coach John McKay and brought with him hopes that the Utes football program would be turned around, but an inability to get recruiting going led to on-field issues that essentially <b>prevented</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of viable football success.|$|R
5|$|A {{modus vivendi}} had been {{achieved}} between Warwick {{and the king}} for some months, but the restoration of Henry Percy to Montagu's earldom of Northumberland <b>prevented</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of full reconciliation. A trap was set for the king when disturbances in Lincolnshire led him north, where he could be confronted by Warwick's men. Edward, however, discovered the plot when Robert, Lord Welles, was routed at Losecote Field, and gave away the plan.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} closed on 8 November 1978 {{along with the}} branch line to Alexandra. The line was quickly {{dismantled}} following closure, <b>preventing</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of tourist services from operating along the line despite some interest being shown. Many bridges along the line were also removed with only the uprights remaining. The line has since been reopened as a 134 kilometre bike trail, the Goulburn River High Country rail trail. The trail {{was funded by the}} Federal Government and local councils.|$|R

50|$|The {{military}} commission, {{presided over}} by Hulin, drew up the act of condemnation, being incited thereto by orders from Anne Jean Marie René Savary, who had come charged with instructions to kill the duke. Savary <b>prevented</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of an interview between the condemned and the First Consul, and, on 21 March, the duke {{was shot in the}} moat of the castle, near a grave which had already been prepared. A platoon of the Gendarmes d'élite {{was in charge of the}} execution.|$|R
50|$|In {{this role}} Blowitz became famous, {{both as a}} {{journalist}} and for his insights into diplomacy. In 1875, the duc de Decazes, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, informed him of a confidential despatch from the French ambassador to Berlin, discussing German plans to attack France, and requested Blowitz publish an exposé; he did so, provoking a storm of public opinion, and effectively <b>preventing</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of the German intention being carried out. In 1877 and 1888 he successfully exposed internal conspiracies against the Republic.|$|R
50|$|So thus, {{it is that}} {{whenever}} a Space Hulk is detected in the proximity of a human planet, the stalwart warriors of the Space Marines are detached to rid the Hulk of its Genestealer cargo, <b>preventing</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of another planet falling victim to the Genestealer curse. Such is the combat prowess of the Genestealer that only the Terminator squads have met with any success. That is the player's status {{and this is the}} player's mission: rid the galaxy of the Genestealer menace once and for all.|$|R
60|$|The palace {{was large}} enough to afford {{accommodation}} for the whole army; and as it {{was surrounded by a}} massive stone wall, flanked with towers, Cortez saw, with satisfaction, that it could without difficulty resist any sudden attack. He placed sentries on the walls, and planted his cannon to command the approaches; and in order to <b>prevent</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of a quarrel arising, he forbade any soldiers to leave the palace, without orders. A large number of Mexican slaves had been appointed to attend upon the strangers, and a meal was speedily served by them to the troops, who were then permitted to take a sleep, for some hours, during the heat of the day.|$|E

From some natives he learned the direction that the cavalry had taken, and presently on rising ground, saw two parties halted in hollows some two miles apart. The farthest out on the plain appeared to be the largest, and to this he rode. The officer in command had seen him in camp, and as he saluted on riding up, said: ...|$|E

It has also pleased Providence to putt me here in command. You know I'm not given to boastin', but there are times when it is advisable to have plain speakin'. There is a small supply of spirits aboard, and I just want to tell 'ee--merely as a piece of useful information, and to <b>prevent</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> o' future trouble--that as I've got charge o' them spirits I mean to keep charge of 'em." ...|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was run by a Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in the state legislature. It was by the actions of Governor Oliver Morton, who illegally borrowed millions of dollars to finance the army, that Indiana could contribute so greatly to the war effort. Morton suppressed the state legislature {{with the help of the}} Republican minority to prevent it from assembling during 1861 and 1862. This <b>prevented</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> the Democrats might have had to interfere with the war effort or to attempt to secede from the Union.|$|R
50|$|After Tyrion Lannister's arrest by Catelyn Stark, Tywin marches on the Riverlands with 60,000 men, giving half to Jaime Lannister to besiege House Tully's {{ancestral home}} of Riverrun. Tywin takes his {{force to the}} Trident to battle Robb Stark's men, but Robb instead leads his force on Riverrun and captures Jaime. When Joffrey Baratheon ascends as king, he names Tywin as his Hand but also executes the former Hand, Eddard Stark. Realising that Eddard's death <b>prevents</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of suing for peace, Tywin sends Tyrion to King's Landing as acting Hand, while he {{continues}} the campaign in the Riverlands.|$|R

Their three children, Paul Augustus (1805-1864), William (1805-1878), and Michael (1807-1889) also became artists. His {{relationship with his}} wife however deteriorated gradually over the years, which is detailed in papers stored at the library of the Victoria and Albert Museum. His strong Catholic beliefs <b>prevented</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of a divorce but they separated. He accused her of [...] "bad conduct" [...] but shied from providing details. In a letter to him in 1827 she blamed him entirely for the collapse of their marriage, suggesting cruelty, pederastic activities and adultery were the reasons.|$|R
6000|$|My Own Dearest,--I {{think that}} it would be {{unreasonable}} upon the part of your Uncle Percival to think that we ought to have changed the date of a matter so important to ourselves, simply in order that he should be present. I am sure that on second thoughts your mother and yourself will see the thing in this light. I must say, however, that in one point I think you both show great judgment. It would certainly be invidious to be married IMMEDIATELY before his arrival. I really think that he would have some cause for complaint if we did that. To <b>prevent</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of hurting his feelings, I {{think that it}} would be far best, if your mother and you agree with me, that we should be married upon July 7th.

60|$|On {{the evening}} {{previous}} to the fair at Mohill {{mentioned in the}} last chapter, Captain Ussher with a party of his men had succeeded in making a seizure of some half-malted barley in a cabin on the margin of a little lake on the low mountains, which lay between Mohill and Cashcarrigan. He had, as in these cases was always his practice, received information from a spy in his pay, who accompanied him, dressed {{as one of his}} own men, to <b>prevent</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of his being recognised; this man's name was Cogan, and {{he had been in the}} habit of buying illicit whiskey from the makers at a very cheap rate, and carrying it round to the farmers' houses and towns for sale, whereby he obtained considerable profit,--but at considerable risk. With this employment Captain Ussher had made himself acquainted, and instead of seizing the man whilst in possession of the whiskey, he had sounded him, and finding him sufficiently a villain, had taken him into his pay as a spy; this trade Cogan found more lucrative even than the former, but also more dangerous; as if detected he might reckon on his death as certain. He still continued to buy the spirits from the people, but in smaller quantities; he offered lower prices; and though he nominally kept up the trade, it was more for the purpose of knowing where the potheen was, than of buying and selling it.|$|E

40|$|Lower incisor flaring {{is often}} {{encountered}} during Forsus treatment. To prevent this, consolidating the entire mandibular arch by ligature wire and cinching back the mandibular archwire has been recommended. However, lower incisor flaring might still occur due to ligature breakage from friction of the push rods and also cinching back the mandibular archwire {{might not be}} possible in few cases due to anatomic limitations. The following article describes an innovative technique to <b>prevent</b> <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> of lower incisor flaring during Forsus treatment in cases where cinching the archwire is not possible due to anatomic limitations. This method is simple, inexpensive, less time consuming and comfortable for the patient...|$|R
50|$|The venue became {{increasingly}} shunned by international racing series as {{concerns about the}} public roads' dangerous nature rose. In 1971, the newly-built and much safer Circuit Paul Ricard held the French Grand Prix for the first time, before becoming the events permanent home from 1973 onwards. It continued to host smaller motorsports competitions such as Formula 3, sports car racing, touring car racing, rallying and hillclimbing {{as well as the}} Trophées d'Auverne. In 1980, three track marshals were killed at a touring car race, and in 1984 there was a drivers protest over track safety. Faced with increasing safety issues and with the natural topography <b>preventing</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of adding run-off areas, the final race on the original 8 km track was held on September 18, 1988.|$|R
5000|$|Hitherto {{the system}} {{followed}} {{by the government in}} supervising the construction of scientific instruments for official use had been to keep a stock of patterns, invite tenders for copying them, and accept the lowest, thus <b>preventing</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of improvement in the type of instrument, and affording no guarantee for good workmanship or material. Strange abolished the patterns, encouraged invention, insured competition as to price by employing at least two makers for each class of instrument, and enforced strict supervision; a marked improvement in design and workmanship was soon evident, and the cost of the establishment was shown in his first decennial report to be only about [...]028 of one per cent. of the outlay on the works which the instruments were employed in designing or executing.|$|R
50|$|In {{practice}} {{it helps to}} insert the thumb under the lower turns since this facilitates threading the tail in later. After passing the tail round the standing end, the tail then must pass back behind the standing line and up through the desired number of turns of the coil. A stopper knot is then added to the dangling tail to <b>prevent</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of it pulling out.|$|E

On the Eagles' next drive, Jaworski fumbled a snap and Oakland lineman Willie Jones recovered it. Following a Raiders punt, Martin recorded a Super Bowl record third interception, and the Raiders ran out the clock to win the game.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} times when the {{reservoir}} has become seriously depleted. On 8 February 2007 the lake recorded an all-time low of 32.5% of capacity, although by late 2008 the water level had returned to 60% of capacity. To <b>prevent</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of water supply failure, the NSW Government authorised the construction and operation of the Sydney Desalination Plant to augment Sydney's water supply.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990-91 season, Coventry's {{problems}} with league form returned and in November 1990 {{with the club}} sitting only two points above the relegation zone, Sillett was sacked by chairman John Poynton after five years in charge. Sillett received the news of his sacking whilst feeling unwell at home. He was replaced by Terry Butcher, the former England defender who was released from his contract with Rangers in a £350,000 deal. Butcher, aged 32, became player-manager {{and at the time}} was the youngest manager employed in English league football. From Boxing Day, Coventry's fortunes turned as they went on a great run by picking up 29 points from the next 17 league games (losing only four matches during this form) which <b>prevented</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of Coventry going down.|$|R
5000|$|Philosopher Nick Bostrom classifies risks {{according}} to their scope and intensity. A [...] "global catastrophic risk" [...] is any risk that is at least [...] "global" [...] in scope, and is not subjectively [...] "imperceptible" [...] in intensity. Those that are at least [...] "trans-generational" [...] (affecting all future generations) in scope and [...] "terminal" [...] in intensity are classified as existential risks. While a global catastrophic risk may kill {{the vast majority of}} life on earth, humanity could still potentially recover. An existential risk, on the other hand, is one that either destroys humanity (and, presumably, all but the most rudimentary species of non-human lifeforms and/or plant life) entirely or at least <b>prevents</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of civilization recovering. Bostrom considers existential risks to be far more significant.|$|R
25|$|However, the Raiders {{completely}} {{took over}} the rest of the game, <b>preventing</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of a Washington comeback. On the ensuing drive, Washington defensive back Darrell Green was called for a 38-yard pass interference penalty while trying to cover Raiders receiver Malcolm Barnwell, setting up running back Marcus Allen's 5-yard touchdown run seven plays later to make the score 28–9. Late in the third quarter, the Redskins had an opportunity to score after defensive back Anthony Washington forced and recovered a fumble from Branch at the Raiders 35-yard line. They moved the ball nine yards in their next three plays, and then faced fourth down and one. Washington attempted to convert the fourth down with a run by Riggins, just like their successful fourth down conversion against the Miami Dolphins in the previous Super Bowl. But this time, Riggins was tackled by Martin for no gain.|$|R
