A duration model of <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> certificates is used to infer the private appropriability of returns from agricultural crop variety innovations in the UK over the period 1965 - 2000. The results suggest that <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> provides only modest appropriability of returns to innovators of agricultural crop varieties. The val- ue distribution of <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> certificates is highly skewed with {{a large proportion of}} innovations providing virtually no returns to innovators.

40|$|Many {{developing}} countries are currently engaged in designing and implementing <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> systems. Encouraging private investment in plant breeding is the key rationale for extending intellectual property rights to plant varieties. However, the design of <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> systems in {{developing countries}} {{has been dominated by}} concerns regarding the inequities of a <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> system, especially the imbalance in the reward structure between plant breeders and farmers. The private seed industry, a key stakeholder in <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection,</b> appears to be playing only a peripheral role {{in the design of the}} intellectual property rights regime. This paper explores the potential response of the private seed industry in India to <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> legislation based on a survey of major plant breeding companies. The survey finds that the private seed industry in India is generally unenthusiastic about the legislation and <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> is likely to have only a very limited impact on their research profile and expenditures on plant breeding. Measures designed to curb the 'excessive' profits of breeders, farmers' rights provisions and poor prospects for enforcement of rights are seen to be seriously diluting breeders' rights, leaving few incentives for innovation. If the fundamental objective of <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> is to stimulate private investment in plant breeding, then developing countries need to seriously address the question of improving appropriability of returns from investment...|$|R

40|$|Under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, all member-countries of the World Trade Organization are {{required}} to provide an "effective" system of <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> within a specific time frame. In many developing countries, {{this has led to}} a divisive debate about the fundamental desirability of extending intellectual property rights to agriculture. Empirical studies on the economic impacts of <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection,</b> especially its ability to generate large private sector investments in plant breeding and to facilitate the transfer of technology, have been very limited. This paper examines two aspects of the international experience of plant variety protection: (a) the relationship between legislation, research, and development expenditures and <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> grants, i. e., the innovation effect and (b) the role of <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> in facilitating the flow of varieties across countries, i. e., the transferability effect...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} international {{trends in}} <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection,</b> {{a form of}} intellectual property rights for plant varieties akin to patents. The TRIPs Agreement under the WTO has given a strong impetus for the universalisation of <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> regimes with common standards of protection across countries. This paper argues that developed and developing countries are likely to adopt widely divergent approaches {{to the development of}} intellectual property rights for plant varieties. The special features of <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> constrain the appropriability of economic returns from protected plant varieties. Consequently, in developed countries PVP is being seen as a relatively weak intellectual property right instrument. As stronger forms of <b>protection</b> for <b>plant</b> varieties become available, the importance of <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> in developed countries may decline. Developing countries continue to debate the merits of extending intellectual property rights to agriculture, though they too are obliged under the TRIPs Agreement to protect plant varieties. Their concerns are focused on the “inequities” inherent in a system of plant breeders’ rights. Attempts by developing countries to incorporate farmers’ rights provisions in their PVP systems are likely to dilute the incentives for private investment in plant breeding.

50|$|Plant variety {{certificates}} {{should not}} be confused with plant patents. The <b>Plant</b> Variety <b>Protection</b> Act (PVPA) and the Plant Patent Act of 1930 provide protection based on different types of plant reproductive strategies. The PVPA, which authorizes <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> certificates, protects sexually reproduced and tuber propagated plants, whereas the Plant Patent Act, which authorizes plant patents, is limited to asexually reproduced plants, excluding tuber propagated plants. However, the same plant may be protected under both the <b>Plant</b> Variety <b>Protection</b> Act and the Plant Patent Act of 1930. The most appropriate means of protection may be decided by the applicant based on the applicant's business requirements.|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} find a {{suitable}} minifauna of beetles for Australia, Bornemissza set up the Australian Dung Beetle Research Unit in Pretoria, South Africa to find species that would complement the work of O. gazella. South Africa was chosen as a location to study dung beetles for several reasons. Firstly, there are {{a large number of}} different species from which to choose from (some 800 species south of the Zambezi and Kunene rivers alone), and these species have co-evolved alongside large bovids (e.g. African buffalo) for many thousands of years. There are also homologies between the sub-tropical climates of areas of the two countries. The political climate in other parts of Africa and the more advanced nature of scientific research in South Africa also made it an ideal location. The <b>Plant</b> <b>Protection</b> Research Institute in South Africa funded much of the work at this research base.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> (PVP) {{is a major}} issue on the 'seed agenda' in many ACP countries. The discussion concentrates on issues of morality, and {{on the effects of}} <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> on the international seed trade, subsistence farming and genetic diversity. Variety description is a standard procedure in many variety release programmes. Often this is done by a branch of the seed quality control and certification organization or by the breeder himself. The aim of this procedure is to characterize the new variety {{in such a way that}} field inspectors can identify the variety and off-types within a seed production field without bias. This system relates to a d. u. s. -test (distinctness, uniformity, stability) which is one of the steps in a variety registration procedure for <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection.</b> The legal dimension of the latter requires, however, a more elaborate administrative procedure and a more exhaustive method for variety characterization. The Center for Plant Breeding and Reproduction Research (CPRO-DLO), based in Wageningen, the Netherlands has recently started a new international service in the field of variety registration research. The service includes possibilities for training both in Wageningen and in national or regional settings, consultancy 'on-site' and a free question-and-ansvver service. Workshops will be organized in cooperation with the international <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> organization, and other international bodies to exchange views and methods, and to investigate the effects of <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> in different parts of the world. The service can be useful for countries that have already passed a <b>plant</b> variety <b>protection</b> legislation act. Such an act may be based on independent variety testing (European system), independent supervision of breeder's tests (Australian system) or a purely administrative procedure (US system). The Centre offers assistance in streamlining procedures in order to minimize delays in variety introduction, and in the execution or jointly developing appropriate methods of variety characterization. Also countries that do not have a PVP-act can request for the services in order to strengthen their variety characterization in the course of preparing for a PVP-act or for certification purposes only.
