500|$|Following {{decontamination}} and {{the institution}} of supportive measures, the next priority is inhibition of further ethylene glycol metabolism using antidotes. The antidotes for ethylene glycol poisoning are ethanol and fomepizole. This antidotal treatment forms the mainstay of management of ethylene glycol poisoning. [...] The toxicity of ethylene glycol comes from its metabolism to glycolic acid and oxalic acid. [...] The goal of pharmacotherapy is to prevent the formation of these metabolites. [...] Ethanol acts by competing with ethylene glycol for alcohol dehydrogenase, the first enzyme in the degradation pathway. [...] Because ethanol has a much higher affinity for alcohol dehydrogenase, about a 100-times greater affinity, it successfully blocks the breakdown of ethylene glycol into glycolaldehyde, which prevents the further degradation. [...] Without oxalic acid formation, the nephrotoxic effects can be avoided, but the ethylene glycol is still present in the body. [...] It is eventually excreted in the urine, but supportive therapy for the CNS depression and metabolic acidosis will be required until the ethylene glycol concentrations fall below toxic limits.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{evaluate}} the possible use of three types of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>grades</b> of phyllosilicates as pharmaceutical excipients. Seven samples (two smectites, three palygorskites, and two sepiolites) were studied. A complete mineralogical and chemical characterization of each material was made and powder texture was established by image analysis of scanning electron micrographs. Powder flow properties were then determined and the influence of textural characteristics on powder rheology and particle packing was assessed. Mineral contents were adequate for the sepiolites (� 90 % of main mineral) and smectites (78 and 95 %), but should be improved on the palygorskite samples (around 50 % of main mineral in two of the studied samples). According to the textural characterization, the samples presented almost equal size distributions, but exhibited two different morphologies (i. e., laminar for smectites and fibrous for sepiolites and palygorskites). Both sepiolites possessed high flowability, whereas this factor varied from medium to low in the other materials. The compressibility of smectites was adequate, whereas that of palygorskites was high and that of the sepiolites was low.

Lactose exists in crystalline and amorphous forms. The crystalline forms are alpha lactose monohydrate, anhydrous alpha lactose, beta lactose and compound crystals. The consequences for dairy and pharmaceutical products of the interconversion of these forms are described. Moisture induced crystallization of amorphous lactose is a cause of physical and chemical instability in dairy and pharmaceutical products. Methods for estimating the level of amorphous lactose- and its obverse, the estimation of “lactose crystallinity”- are described. Edible and <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>grades</b> of lactose are made by cooling batch crystallization of whey permeate supersaturated in lactose.

40|$|Abstract: High {{doses of}} <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>graded</b> heroin in {{combination}} with methadone are prescribed nowadays in a Dutch trial with methadone treatment refractory heroin addicts. Heroin is prescribed either through intravenous injection or inhalation. One of the major risks of using opioids is ventilatory depression. In this study, the effect of heroin on oxygen saturation rate (SpO 2) {{in a group of}} opioid tolerant patients was investigated. SpO 2 was measured in 22 patients on heroin treatment (12 injectors, 10 inhalers) during 4 consecutive days. Heroin dosages were varied double-blindly from 67 % to 150 % of the regular dose. Methadone dosages remained unchanged and took place 120 minutes after heroin intake. SpO 2 assessments took place till 250 minutes after heroin administration. From 20 subjects, heroin plasma concentrations could be obtained. At the first measurement 13 minutes after heroin administration, the average SpO 2 dropped from a pre-dose level of 96. 9 % to 93. 8 % (difference 3. 1 %; 95 % CI: 2. 4 - 3. 8 %; p< 0. 0001). This decline in SpO 2 was not related to heroin dose or plasma concentrations, and {{there were no significant differences}} between intravenous heroin users and heroin inhalers. Co-administration of benzodiazepines in 10 patients, however, caused a significant additive reducing effect on the SpO 2 levels (p< 0. 0001).

40|$|A {{series of}} placebo powders for {{inhalation}} was characterized regarding bulk density and powder flowability using different techniques. The powders {{were of the}} ordered mixture type and were prepared by mixing a <b>pharmaceutical</b> carrier <b>grade</b> of lactose with different fractions of intermediate sized and fine (i. e., micronized) lactose. A modified Hausner Ratio was obtained by measurement of the poured and the compressed bulk densities. Other tests investigated were the angle of repose, the avalanching behaviour using the AeroFlow, and the yield strength using the Uniaxial tester. Furthermore, the relation between ordered mixture composition and flowability was examined. Of the methods investigated, the modified Hausner Ratio discriminates well between the investigated powders and {{seems to have the}} widest measuring range. It was also found that the poured and compressed bulk densities provide information about the packing of the particles in the powders. A good correlation was obtained between the modified Hausner Ratio and the angle of repose. The AeroFlow was suitable for powders with a low percentage of fine particles, but could not discriminate between the more cohesive powders. The Uniaxial tester, on the other hand, seems to be better suited for more cohesive powders. Regarding the powder composition, addition of micronized particles has a strong influence on the flowability of ordered mixtures, while intermediate sized particles have little impact on the powder flow.

40|$|The total ethanol {{production}} {{capacity in the}} US just passed 6 billion gals/year. The production process of ethanol from corn includes corn milling, cooking, enzymatic starch conversion, fermentation and distillation. Food-grade alcohol production requires more care and undergoes costly additional purification to remove volatile organic impurities. These impurities could be of health concern and/or impart unpleasant tastes and odors to beverage alcohol. Multiple distillation steps are usually employed. The additional purification of ethanol to obtain food-grade alcohol adds at least $ 0. 30 per gallon in processing costs. In this research, we tested a novel approach to purify fuel <b>grade</b> ethanol to <b>pharmaceutical</b> and beverage <b>grade.</b> The cost of the proposed treatment process {{is expected to be}} less than $ 0. 01 per gallon.

To date, we confirmed a significant reduction of some impurities with ozone alone. Ozone and granular activated carbon are very effective in purifying fuel ethanol. Also, we designed a purer ozone generating setup. This setup can provide further purification efficiency on this research.

A co-crystal has never been incorporated into a liquid dosage form with the assurance of maintaining its co-crystal state until absorption under defined conditions. This study aims to develop a liquid formulation with a nevirapine co-crystal. A protocol was developed to investigate all the five co-formers {{that were used to}} make the nevirapine co-crystals to-date. The most appropriate co-former was selected for a liquid dosage form to study the integrity and the scaling up of the co-crystal in a suspension formulation. Co-formers used were viz. saccharin, glutaric acid, salicylic acid, rac-tartaric acid and maleic acid. These were characterized according to their physical, chemical, pharmacological and <b>pharmaceutical</b> properties. A <b>grading</b> scale was used to select the most appropriate co-former for a suspension formulation. Comparatively, saccharin produced the best combination of physical, chemical, pharmacological and pharmaceutical properties, especially with regard to the particle size and the specific gravity which proved to be very useful as optimal criteria for suspension formulation. Upon selection of the ideal co-former, scale-up of the nevirapine saccharin co-crystal was performed from a small scale of 350 mg to a large scale of 5 g. Nevirapine-saccharin (NVSC) co-crystals were prepared utilizing the slow evaporation technique, using methanol as the solvent and the percentage yield of the co-crystals were > 80 %. The identity of co-crystals was confirmed using hot stage microscopy (HSM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), fourier transform infra- red (FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Three co-crystal suspension formulations were prepared using the excipients identified in the branded, Viramune® suspension, with each formulation containing viscosity enhancers such as aerosil 200, carbopol 971 G and carbopol 974 P. To ascertain the co- crystal integrity in the suspension, it was filtered and the filtrate was identified with DSC and FTIR while the filtered solution was identified with ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV). The co-crystal suspension formulation with optimal pH, viscosity and assurance of co-crystal integrity was the carbopol 974 P formulation. The UV and DSC of the filtrate of the suspension revealed that the co-crystal had not separated into its individual components and remained intact while in suspension form irrespective of the excipients added. This formulation proceeded to the quality control stage. It was assessed for its pH, viscosity and dissolution according to the USP 32 standards and compared to the branded nevirapine suspension, Viramune ®, presently on the market.
