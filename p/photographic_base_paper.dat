50|$|Oil paint {{contains}} {{particles of}} pigment applied using a drying oil, such as linseed oil. The conventions and techniques of using oils demands {{a knowledge of}} drawing and painting, so it is often used in professional practice. When hand-colouring with oils, the approach is more often to use the photographic image simply {{as a base for}} a painted image. The ability to create accurate oil portraits using a <b>photographic</b> <b>base</b> lent itself to art crime, with some artists claiming to paint traditional oil portraits (for a higher price) when actually tracing a photograph base in oils. Therefore, the choice of oil colours is governed by the relative transparency of the pigments to allow for authentication of the <b>photographic</b> <b>base.</b> It is necessary to size the print first to prevent absorption of the colours into the paper. In the past, photographic lantern slides were often coloured by the manufacturer, though sometimes by the user, with variable results. Usually, oil colours were used for such slides, though in the collodion era - from 1848 {{to the end of the}} 19th century - sometimes watercolours were used as well.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis was to gain a greater {{understanding}} of the interactions between the <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> and coating color in the metered size press (MSP) nip. The effect of <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> in precoating with an MSP was investigated using mill woodfree <b>base</b> <b>papers,</b> laboratory sheets, pilot <b>base</b> <b>papers</b> and non-porous materials. The coating color formulations consisted of commercial raw materials, in most cases latex-CMC colors with a pigment mixture of CaCO 3 and kaolin. Coating studies were carried out at 1000 m / min with a pilot-scale MSP coater. The coating layer formation on woodfree <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> in MSP precoating depended mainly on the <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> surface openness. Lowering the <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> openness by raising the filler content, adding mechanical pulp or through more intensive refining of the chemical pulps resulted in lower coatweights, but better coating coverage. <b>Base</b> <b>paper</b> roughness, small-scale basis weight variation (beta formation) and surface chemical properties of the fibers (hydrophilic / hydrophobic) had no effect on precoating layer formation or coverage. Coating color liquid phase seemed to penetrate mainly into the voids between the fibers, because of the short contact time in the film transfer nip. SEM-BSE and LIPS coverage measuring methods were found to give similar results for the precoated surfaces. The LIPS coverage results were lower than the SEM-BSE results at low coatweights. This indicated that the SEM-BSE method found thinner coating layers to be covered. Low <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> surface openness and high filler content {{on the surface of the}} sheet reduced coating color penetration into the <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> structure and the coating color stayed on the surface better. Dense <b>base</b> <b>papers</b> with high filler contents gave better small-scale uniformity than porous <b>base</b> <b>papers.</b> The coating coverage was sensitive to <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> shadow marking, which was clearly seen as large-scale coverage non-uniformity. With <b>base</b> <b>papers</b> with less filler on the surface, coverage could still be increased by increasing coating color viscosity. Using higher levels of kaolin in the coating formula improved coverage, especially at low coatweights. The machine speed and nip load did not affect coating coverage. The color solids content had only a minor impact on coating coverage. Smaller differences in coverage two-sidedness were observed when both paper sides were coated simultaneously compared to the situation where only one side was coated. When the paper was coated using hard rolls, coating coverage depended largely on the pore size of the <b>base</b> <b>paper.</b> Coatweight was formed mainly through penetration, the result being a dense coating layer. With soft rolls coating layer formation occurred more by dewatering, in which case better coverage was obtained, albeit accompanied by a porous coating layer. The porous coating layer with good coverage was the result of filter cake formation in the film transfer nip. The main mechanism by which coating layer formation took place was pressure-induced penetration of bulk coating color or liquid phase into the voids between fibers in the transfer nip. Water sorption into the fibers was slower than capillary penetration, and the movement of coating color liquid phase by diffusion and possibly by capillary absorption took place mainly after the nip. reviewe...|$|R

While photographic reconstruction is a fast <b>photographic</b> <b>based</b> recording technique resulting in highly versatile textured meshes, photogrammetry and laser scanning point clouds and mesh offer the opportunity of 3 D measurements but are constrained by their lack of visual appeal. Because of the visual appeal of photographic reconstruction the resulting meshes are well-suited for integration into animation, visualisation and virtual reality applications. Being photography based there is scope for dealing with variable lighting conditions. Multiple exposure high dynamic range (HDR) photography can be deployed using a tripod, although a consequence of this is longer recordings times.|$|R
