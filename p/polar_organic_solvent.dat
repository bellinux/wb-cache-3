50|$|In normal-phase chromatography, {{the least}} polar {{compounds}} elute {{first and the}} most polar compounds elute last. The mobile phase consists of a nonpolar solvent such as hexane or heptane mixed with a slightly more polar solvent such as isopropanol, ethyl acetate or chloroform. Retention decreases {{as the amount of}} polar solvent in the mobile phase increases. In reversed phase chromatography, the most polar compounds elute first with the most nonpolar compounds eluting last. The mobile phase is generally a binary mixture of water and a miscible <b>polar</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> like methanol, acetonitrile or THF. Retention increases as the amount of the polar solvent (water) in the mobile phase increases. Normal phase chromatography, an adsorptive mechanism, is used for the analysis of solutes readily soluble in organic solvents, based on their polar differences such as amines, acids, metal complexes, etc.. Reversed-phase chromatography, a partition mechanism, is typically used for separations by non-polar differences.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAdsorptive {{removal of}} {{hydrodesulfurization}} inhibitors, that is, nitrogen-containing compounds (N-compounds), was studied using model fuel which contains carbazole and dibenzothiophene in an n-dodecane−toluene mixture over ion-exchange resins (IXRs) in batch and in fixed-bed adsorption systems. The adsorptive capacity and selectivity for neutral N-compounds were examined. The high affinity for neutral N-compounds present in hydrocarbon feed was explained by hydrogen bonding between the chloride anion (with nonbonding electrons) and the neutral N-compounds. However, {{the presence of}} a flat charged cation, that is, N-alkylated pyridinium, is essential to ensure the adsorption of neutral N-compounds. The regeneration of the sorbent could be easily performed using <b>polar</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> like methanol. Commercially available IXR bearing pyridinium chloride functionality (HPQ) was further evaluated with straight-run fuel oil. The N/S selectivity decreases, but analysis of the adsorbed compounds by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) shows that no paraffin and no monoaromatics were adsorbed.

40|$|Chain-like {{agglomeration}} (one-dimensional self-assembly) of aqueous gold nanoparticles (NPs) {{has been}} experimentally and theoretically studied. It is {{demonstrated that the}} chain growth of aqueous gold NPs is mainly triggered by the anisotropic dipolar interaction due to the Au-S bonding originating from the thiol-ligand capping, plus van der Waals interaction. This anisotropic self-assembly can be endorsed by the isotropic electrostatic repulsion between the gold NPs, which can be finely tuned by the dielectric constant of the surrounding media of the NPs that {{is dependent on the}} volume ratio of water to a <b>polar</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvent.</b> Adding more thiol-ligands or NaCl brings a similar effect of increasing the ionic strength of the NP suspensions, thus lowering the electrostatic repulsion between and, at a certain range, accelerating chain-like agglomeration of the NPs.

Astrocytes {{play a central role in}} maintaining brain homeostasis, but the effect and mechanism of DMSO on astrocytes has not been studied. The present study showed that exposure of astrocyte cultures to 1 % DMSO for 24 h did not significantly affect cell survival, but decreased cell viability and glial glutamate transporter expression, and caused mitochondrial swelling, membrane potential impairment and reactive oxygen species production, and subsequent cytochrome c release and caspase- 3 activation. DMSO at concentrations of 5 % significantly inhibited cell variability and promoted apoptosis of astrocytes, accompanied with more severe mitochondrial damage. These results suggest that mitochondrial impairment is a primary event in DMSO-induced astrocyte toxicity. The potential cytotoxic effects on astrocytes need to be carefully considered during investigating neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects of hydrophobic agents dissolved by DMSO...|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of submicron particles consisting of double hydrophilic diblock copolymers of poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PEO-b-PVP) {{in aqueous solution}} is described. Block copolymers were synthesized via reversible deactivation radical polymerization using a PEO-xanthate as macro RAFT/MADIX chain transfer agent. Increasing polymer concentrations in aqueous solutions, the block copolymer is able to self-assemble into spherical structures with apparent hydrodynamic diameters in the range between 200 nm and 2 μm. The self-assembly was further improved by copolymerization with a more hydrophilic monomer, N-vinylimidazole (VIm). Submicron particles from PEO-b-P(VP-co-VIm) were preserved via cross-linking utilizing imidazolium formation with a dihalogenide. Thus, submicron double hydrophilic particles were obtained that are stable in organic solvents and under high dilution. Almost quantitative {{formation of}} submicron particles with an average diameter of 200 nm can be afforded by the self-assembly in the <b>polar</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> DMF and subsequent crosslinking as well.

30|$|Various nAbts, {{particularly}} metallic and carbon-based ones, {{have severe}} toxicity generated from prolonged exposure. Although silver NPs provide many benefits, prolonged exposure to soluble silver-containing compounds may produce an irreversible pigmentation {{in the skin}} (argyria) and the eyes (argyrosis) {{in addition to other}} toxic effects [10]. Some studies provide a direct contradiction to this, claiming minimal concentration dependent toxic effects [10, 72]. These concentration dependent toxicities to mammalian cells have been shown in other studies using metallic nanoparticles [73, 74]. Similarly, while nanotubes and fullerenes {{have been shown to be}} potentially toxic, there are some contradictions which suggest that the toxicity may be due to solvent contaminants during preparation [39, 75].
