5000|$|Sonia's Pimple: From {{the episode}} [...] "Liger Castle". Mystique Sonia {{looks in the}} mirror and finds a pimple and Yaksha <b>pops</b> <b>it</b> which causes it to turn into a bean after it got out. The {{difference}} is that the pimple is green; not red and Yaksha <b>pops</b> <b>it</b> instead of Sonia stopping him. Although Sonia said [...] "La la la" [...] and screamed, this is not considered actual dialogue.|$|R
500|$|... "Sunshine of Your Love" [...] is a 1967 song by the British {{rock band}} Cream. With {{elements}} of hard rock, psychedelia, and <b>pop,</b> <b>it</b> {{is one of}} Cream's best-known and most popular songs. [...] Cream bassist and vocalist Jack Bruce based it on a distinctive bass riff or repeated musical phrase he developed after attending a Jimi Hendrix concert. Guitarist Eric Clapton and lyricist Pete Brown later contributed to the song. [...] Recording engineer Tom Dowd suggested the rhythm arrangement in which drummer Ginger Baker plays a distinctive tom-tom drum rhythm, although Baker has claimed it was his idea.|$|E
500|$|In the {{concluding}} statements, one prosecuting attorney {{said that what}} Till did was wrong, but that his action warranted a spanking, not murder. Gerald Chatham passionately called for justice and mocked the sheriff and doctor's statements that alluded to a conspiracy. Mamie Bradley indicated she was very impressed with his summation. The defense stated that the prosecution's theory of the events the night Till was murdered were improbable, and said the jury's [...] "forefathers would turn over in their graves" [...] if they convicted Bryant and Milam. Only three outcomes were possible in Mississippi for capital murder: life imprisonment, the death penalty, or acquittal. On September 23 the all-white, all-male jury (both women and blacks had been banned) acquitted both defendants after a 67-minute deliberation; one juror said, [...] "If we hadn't stopped to drink <b>pop,</b> <b>it</b> wouldn't have taken that long." ...|$|E
500|$|Mia Wasikowska as Alice Kingsleigh. When {{creating}} the character, screenwriter Linda Woolverton researched how young women {{were expected to}} behave in the Victorian era and then made her the opposite. Wasikowska read Carroll's books {{as a child and}} re-read them to prepare for her role. She also watched Jan Švankmajer's Alice. She said, [...] "When we were kids, my mum would <b>pop</b> <b>it</b> in the VCR player. We would be disturbed, and wouldn't really understand it, but we couldn't look away because it was too intriguing. So I had kept that feeling about Alice, a kind of haunting feeling." [...] Although facing pressures to conform to society's expectations, Alice grows into a stronger-willed and empowered heroine who chooses her own path; Independent columnist Liz Hoggard praised Alice as a role model for girls, describing the character as [...] "stubborn, brave, [...] non-girlie".|$|E

5000|$|... "Nightrider" [...] {{became the}} third single from the album; despite an {{appearance}} on the UK chart television program Top of the <b>Pops,</b> <b>it</b> failed to chart.|$|R
500|$|... "Hold It Against Me" [...] {{is three}} minutes and forty-nine seconds long. It is a dance-pop song that blends {{pulsating}} industrial and trance beats with elements of grime. Spears' vocals {{have been described}} as [...] "a bit treated" [...] but not heavily Auto-Tuned. The chorus, reminiscent of other pop productions by Max Martin, has lilting synths that lift her vocals and contrast them with the hard beats. After the second chorus, the beats drop and Spears speaks the lines in the hook. This is followed by a dubstep-influenced breakdown, which lasts about thirty seconds. Spears moans, blows kisses and sings the lines [...] "Gimme something good, don't wanna wait I want it now / <b>Pop</b> <b>it</b> like a hood and show me how you work it out." [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] continues with a second breakdown, which is more similar {{to the sound of the}} track. The final chorus has a smattering of rave chords and the song has a sudden end.|$|E
500|$|Tonight (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie {{collaborating with}} Tina Turner and, once again, Iggy <b>Pop.</b> <b>It</b> {{included}} {{a number of}} cover songs, among them the 1966 Beach Boys hit [...] "God Only Knows". The album bore the transatlantic Top 10 hit [...] "Blue Jean", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, [...] "Jazzin' for Blue Jean". Bowie performed at Wembley Stadium in 1985 for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premiered, Bowie's duet with Mick Jagger. [...] "Dancing in the Street" [...] quickly went to number one on release. The same year, Bowie worked with the Pat Metheny Group to record [...] "This Is Not America" [...] for the soundtrack of The Falcon and the Snowman. Released as a single, the song became a Top 40 hit in the UK and US.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings to the [...] "sexual teasing" [...] lyrics, which are {{addressed}} to the men looking at her: [...] "I can be a tease, but I really wanna please you [...] Oohhh you watchin me shake it, [...] Ya can't take it, it’s blazin ...". The chorus lines; [...] "Dip it, <b>pop</b> <b>it,</b> twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight" [...] are sung in a very quick and breathless manner by Beyoncé. Bret McCabe noted that her pace could be {{compared to that of}} American singer Donna Summer. Slim Thug appears again after the second verse to perform another different verse rap: [...] "I’m checking on you boo, do what’chu do / And while you dance I’ma glance at this beautiful view / I’m keep my hands in my pants, I need to glue ’em with glue ...". Before the song ends, Beyoncé repeats the chorus lines four times as additional vocals of hers are played in the background.|$|E

500|$|Nick Levine of Digital Spy {{gave the}} song {{four out of}} five stars, he spoke of the song giving Kesha a [...] "hussy image" [...] but {{described}} the lyrics in a positive manner. Levine said the use of auto-tune was [...] "fun" [...] and described Dr. Luke's backing track as [...] "bouncy" [...] and [...] "bubblegummy". The review highlighted the song's chorus with Levine calling it [...] "stonking great" [...] and [...] "completely trashy in the best possible way." [...] David Jeffries of Allmusic called the track [...] "fun", listing it as one of the album's best tracks. David Renshaw of Drowned in Sound felt that the song was effective in what it was trying to do, writing: [...] "Trashy and rambunctious, it’s a brash summer anthem about getting drunk and partying hard. World rocking it might not be, but as a piece of disposable <b>pop</b> <b>it</b> captures a moment and boasts a huge hook which, really, is all you need to rule the radio, TV and ringtone airwaves." [...] Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly listed the song as the recommended download off of Animal, writing that [...] "her Valley Girl sneer with electro-glam arrangements that make brushing one's teeth 'with a bottle of Jack' sound like an awesome way to kill the morning-after blues." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Red Hot Kinda Love" [...] {{was written}} by Aguilera, Lucas Secon and Olivia Waithe, with {{production}} done by Secon. An up-tempo song, it combines a variety of genres, including dance and disco, [...] "subtle" [...] tones of Latin, hip hop, and <b>pop.</b> <b>It</b> also features elements of dancehall. The track, which lasts for a duration of , is a [...] "smoky, sultry" [...] song. It features an [...] "old-school hip-hop loop" [...] and vocal samples, as well as [...] "dirty bass" [...] which creates an [...] "underground" [...] feel. On [...] "Red Hot Kinda Love", Aguilera keeps her use of melisma to a minimum which allows for a [...] "relaxed and playful" [...] vocal performance. Lyrically, the song talks about Aguilera's attempts to impress the man she is flirting with. She has [...] "fallen hook, line and sinker for him" [...] and will not {{take no for an}} answer. Chris Younie for 4Music wrote that his favorite lyric in the song is [...] "Baby I'm burning up, you got that red hot kinda love", which the song's hook is built around. According to Sal Cinquemani for Slant Magazine, it features [...] "a catchy pre-chorus, and an even catchier chorus." [...] Andrew Hampp for Billboard compared the song's structure to those performed by Britney Spears and Kylie Minogue which they have [...] "specialized in for years." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Viva la Vida" [...] is a rock album, {{and is more}} {{specifically}} described as alternative rock, art rock, pop rock, and indie <b>pop.</b> <b>It</b> features influences of dream pop, art pop and baroque pop.|$|E

2500|$|Dinosaur Jr. is {{considered}} to be an alternative rock band; however the band's musical style, compared to its underground contemporaries in the 1980s, differed in several ways. This included the influence of classic rock on the band's music, their use of feedback, extreme volume and the loud-quiet dynamic, and frontman Mascis' droning vocals. Gerald Cosloy, head of Homestead Records, summarised the band's music: [...] "It was its own bizarre hybrid. ... It wasn't exactly <b>pop,</b> <b>it</b> wasn't exactly punk rock—it was completely its own thing".|$|E
2500|$|... 1964 {{brought the}} first of Mayfield's Black pride anthem {{compositions}}, [...] "Keep on Pushing", which became a Top 10 smash on both the Billboard Pop and R charts, peaking at #10 <b>Pop.</b> <b>It</b> was the title cut from the album of the same name, which also reached the Top 10 on both charts.

2500|$|... "Fireflies" [...] is a gospel-pop song {{which was}} written and {{produced}} by Cragie Dodds from indie-rock outfit One Eskimo. The track opens with a [...] "rotating piano riff" [...] while during the verses and choruses Lewis' vocals are joined by a strings orchestra, all of which critics noted while pointing to the strong gospel influences. [...] "I to You" [...] is another song written by Sandé and produced by Loco. It is driven by a string instrument-led melody, which was performed by the orchestral collective Wired Strings and arranged by Rosie Danvers. [...] "Shake You Up," [...] was noted by critics as a [...] "modern remake" [...] of an 80's pop song with strong elements of bubblegum <b>pop.</b> <b>It</b> was written by Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins and British singer-songwriter Olivia Waithe (also known as Livvi Franc). Critics noted that [...] "Shake You Up" [...] starts with a vocal interlude from Lewis, who asks [...] "Can you turn the music {{up a little bit}} please?" [...] The production, helmed by Darkchild, uses synths and a midtempo [...] "80's pop" [...] melody. Critics compared it to the early work of the late American entertainer Whitney Houston. [...] "Stop the Clocks" [...] returns to the electronic production present on much of the album, but according to critics it was a [...] "lighter instrumental production" [...] that could have been taken from Lewis' last album Echo (2009).|$|E
2500|$|Superstition {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Q {{gave it a}} 4-star rating, saying: [...] "They <b>pop</b> <b>it</b> up with sweet string textures on the single 'Kiss Them for Me', bear down on the maritime metaphor of 'Drifter' with doomy foghorn and bells effects, give it the all but Twin Peaks dreamscape for 'Softly'." [...] Melody Maker highly praised the first single: [...] "'Kiss Them for Me' is gorgeous, wicked and glamorous". In the same paper, reviewer Jon Wilde described Superstition as [...] "a giant record about obsession, phobia, perspective and emotional tyranny". Wilde said that the song [...] "The Ghost in You" [...] was [...] "a furiously pretty six note refrain that haunts long after the needle has returned to safety". In a 4 out of 5 review, Select praised the album, saying that [...] "Kiss Them for Me" [...] was a [...] "passionately laidback" [...] single, [...] "exotic" [...] and [...] "funky", with [...] "an underlying hush of electro pulsebeat" [...] making it dancefloor friendly. The rest of the album was also reviewed favourably. [...] "Drifter" [...] was compared to the soundtrack of a Sergio Leone film {{with a touch of}} [...] "ethereal sensuality", and [...] "Silver Waterfalls" [...] was qualified as [...] "gorgeous". The reviewer noted that the album ends with the [...] "delicate" [...] "Softly", with lyrics bare and tender enough to be almost like Scott Walker. Glyn Brown concluded: [...] "ambitious".|$|E
