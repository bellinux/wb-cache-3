50|$|Density {{dependent}} {{diseases are}} {{significantly less likely}} to cause extinction of a population, as the natural course of disease will bring down the density, and thus the propinquity of individuals in the population.

50|$|Another {{assumption}} of renewable resource harvesting is that populations of organisms do {{not continue to}} grow indefinitely; they reach an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>population</b> size, which occurs {{when the number of}} individuals matches the resources available to the population (i.e., assume classic logistic growth).

40|$|Pathogens causing sexually {{transmitted}} diseases (STDs) often consist of related strains that cause non-{{sexually transmitted}}, or 'ordinary infectious', diseases (OIDs). We use differential equation models of single populations to derive conditions under which a genetic variant with one (e. g. sexual) transmission mode can invade and successfully displace a genetic variant with a different (e. g. non-sexual) transmission mode. Invasion by an STD is easier if the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>population</b> size {{in the presence of}} an OID is smaller; conversely an OID can invade more easily if the equilibrium size of the population with the STD is larger. Invasion of an STD does not depend on the degree of sterility caused by the infection, but does depend on the added mortality caused by a resident OID. In contrast, the ability of an OID to invade a <b>population</b> at <b>equilibrium</b> with an STD decreases as the degree of sterility caused by the STD increases. When <b>equilibrium</b> <b>population</b> sizes for a population infected with an STD are above the point at which non-sexual contacts exceed sexual contacts (the sexual–social crossover point) and when <b>equilibrium</b> <b>population</b> sizes for an OID are below this point, there can be a stable genetic polymorphism for transmission mode. This is most likely when the STD is mildly sterilizing, and the OID causes low or intermediate levels of added mortality. Because we assume the strains are competitively equivalent and there are no heterogeneities associated with the transmission process, the polymorphism is maintained by density-dependent selection brought about by pathogen effects on population size...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Systems: Mathematical Modeling, 2011 A {{primary goal}} in {{ecotoxicology}} is {{the prediction of}} population-level effects of contaminant exposure based on individual-level response. Assessment of toxicity at the population level has predominately focused on the population growth rate (PGR), but the PGR {{may not be a}} relevant toxicological endpoint for <b>populations</b> at <b>equilibrium.</b> <b>Equilibrium</b> <b>population</b> size may be a more meaningful endpoint than the PGR because a <b>population</b> with smaller <b>equilibrium</b> (i. e., long-term mean) size is more susceptible to the negative effects of environmental variability. I address the ecotoxicology individual-to-population extrapolation problem with modeling. I developed and analyzed a general model applicable to many freshwater fish species that includes density-dependent juvenile survival and additional juvenile mortality due to toxicity exposure, and I quantified its effect on <b>equilibrium</b> <b>population</b> size as a means of assessing toxicity. I then used selenium toxicity in bluegill sunfish as an example to assess the effects of environmental stochasticity on toxicity response with simulation modeling. Individual-level effects are typically greater than population-level effects until the individual effect is large, due to compensatory density-dependent relationships. These effects are sensitive to the recruitment potential of a population, in particular the low-density first-year survival rate S_b. Assuming high S_b could result in underestimating effects of population-level toxicity. The equilibrium size depends directly on S_b, the reproductive potential, the toxin concentration at which mean mortality is 50 % (LC 50), and the rate at which individual mortality increases with increasing toxin concentration. More experimental data are needed to decrease the uncertainty in estimating these parameters. Effects of environmental variability resulted in simulated extinctions at much lower toxin concentrations than predicted deterministically...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{outstanding}} puzzles in economics may {{be resolved by}} recognizing that where {{members of a group}} benefit from mutual adherence to a social norm, agents may obey the norm and punish its violators, even when this behavior cannot be motivated by self-regarding, outcome-oriented preferences. This behavior, which we call strong reciprocity, is a form of altruism in that it benefits others {{at the expense of the}} individual exhibiting it. Thus where benefits and costs are measured in fitness terms and where the relevant behaviors are governed by genetic inheritance subject to natural selection, it is generally thought that, as a form of altruism, strong reciprocity cannot invade a population of self-interested types, nor can it be sustained in a stable <b>population</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> We show that strong reciprocity can invade a population of self-interested types and can be sustained in a stable <b>population</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> and we show that, under assumptions that appear to reflect the relevant socialenvironmental conditions, the model can account for the genetic evolution of strong reciprocity. ...|$|E
