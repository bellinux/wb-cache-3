25|$|In March 2014 {{researchers}} {{discovered the}} oldest complete {{example of a}} human with metastatic cancer. The tumors had developed in a 3,000-year-old skeleton found in 2013 in a tomb in Sudan dating back to 1200 BC. The skeleton was analyzed using radiography and a scanning electron microscope. These findings {{were published in the}} <b>Public</b> <b>Library</b> <b>of</b> <b>Science</b> journal.|$|E
40|$|The {{image of}} librarians, archivists and other {{information}} professionals has been affected in recent decades by public misunderstanding of selection and deaccessioning decisions. Librarians counter critiques from publicly available sources, such as Nicholson Baker's book Double Fold, by publishing articles in professional journal literature. This article explores recent headlines generating controversy around selection and weeding issues at libraries, museums, and archives, including cases at the New York <b>Public</b> <b>Library,</b> Buffalo Museum <b>of</b> <b>Science,</b> Birmingham <b>Public</b> <b>Library,</b> and Bowling Green State University. It concludes that a public institution must initiate public dialogue to portray necessary collection development tasks {{in a positive light}} to administrators and the general public...|$|R

In 2000, he served as Writer-in-Residence at the Richmond Hill, Ontario, <b>Public</b> <b>Library.</b> In 2003, he was Writer-in-Residence at the Toronto <b>Public</b> <b>Library's</b> Merril Collection <b>of</b> <b>Science</b> Fiction, Speculation and Fantasy (the first person to hold this post since Judith Merril herself in 1987). In 2006, he was Writer-in-Residence at the Odyssey Writing Workshop. Also in 2006, he was the Edna Staebler Writer-in-Residence at the Kitchener <b>Public</b> <b>Library</b> in the Region of Waterloo, Ontario, {{following}} on the Region of Waterloo's choice of Sawyer's Hominids as the [...] "One Book, One Community" [...] title that all 490,000 residents were encouraged to read in 2005. In 2007 he was the Berton House Writer-in-Residence at Berton House in Dawson City. In 2009, he was the first-ever Writer-in-Residence at the Canadian Light Source, Canada's national synchrotron facility in Saskatoon.|$|R
50|$|Ferguson {{was made}} a {{magistrate}} of the county of Cumberland in 1872, {{and a member of}} the Carlisle city bench in 1881. In 1886, he was elected chairman of quarter sessions. He was elected a member of the Carlisle city council in 1878, and took advantage of his position to gain access to the ancient muniments of the city, many of which he published. In 1881-2 he was chosen mayor and was re-elected in the following year. He was a strong supporter of the city privileges, and when county councils were instituted in January 1889 and he was elected a member for Carlisle, he lost no opportunity of urging the rights of the city. He was one of the promoters of the project by which Tullie House was taken for the use of the city, with a museum, a <b>public</b> <b>library,</b> a school <b>of</b> <b>science</b> and art, and art galleries. Under his influence William Jackson was induced to bequeath to the city the Jackson library, a valuable collection of local literature. In recognition of his services the corporation conferred upon him the honorary freedom of the city in 1896.|$|R
25|$|While {{studies were}} in progress, {{negotiations}} {{were put in}} place for a book and with various broadcasters for documentary programs, all of whom agreed to keep the project secret. A deal went through in the summer of 2008 with The History Channel which has been reported as paying more for this than any other documentary. The team decided to publish their findings online in PLoS ONE, an open access journal of the <b>Public</b> <b>Library</b> <b>of</b> <b>Science.</b> The paper for publication was received by PLoS ONE on March 19, 2009 and accepted on May 12, 2009.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{as part of}} the society's {{discussions about}} the role of {{publications}} and the society's official journal, accompanied by the advent of open access publishing, the ISCB announced a partnership with the <b>Public</b> <b>Library</b> <b>of</b> <b>Science</b> and launched a new open access journal, PLoS Computational Biology. The journal is intended to emphasize computational methods applied to living systems at all scales, from molecular biology to patient populations and ecosystems, and which offer insight for experimentalists. Past president and past publications committee chair Phil Bourne served as the new publication's editor-in-chief and he remains in that role. The first issue of the new journal coincided with the opening day of ISMB 2005, held in Detroit, Michigan.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{publishing}} academic {{journals and}} textbooks {{is a large}} part of an international industry. Critics claim that standardised accounting and profit-oriented policies have displaced the publishing ideal of providing access to all. In contrast to the commercial model, there is non-profit publishing, where the publishing organization is either organised specifically for the purpose of publishing, such as a university press, or is one of the functions of an organisation such as a medical charity, founded to achieve specific practical goals. An alternative approach to the corporate model is open access, the online distribution of individual articles and academic journals without charge to readers and libraries. The pioneers of Open Access journals are BioMed Central and the <b>Public</b> <b>Library</b> <b>of</b> <b>Science</b> (PLoS). Many commercial publishers are experimenting with hybrid models where certain articles or government funded articles are made free due to authors' payment of processing charges, and other articles are available as part of a subscription or individual article purchase.|$|E
