2500|$|The current Mac Mini is {{designed}} to be opened using a round cover {{on the bottom of the}} computer. Prior versions of the Mac Mini were much more difficult to open. Some Mac Mini owners used a <b>putty</b> <b>knife</b> or a pizza cutter to pry open the cases of older models to gain access to the interior for installation of cheaper third party memory upgrades. The official Apple Service Source manual for Mac Mini describes this procedure in detail, including an official Apple part number for a [...] "modified putty knife". It's also possible to use wires to pull the white plastic bottom case out of the metal top case. While opening the case does not actually void the Mac Mini warranty, anything broken while the case is open is not covered. Other modifications include hard disk upgrades, overclocking the processor (G4 only), and upgrading the wireless networking (for older models) to 802.11n. The 2009 model can have its SuperDrive replaced with a second SATA hard drive. The removal of the optical drive in the 2011 models leaves internal space for a second internal hard drive or SSD, which can be ordered as a BTO option from Apple, or as an upgrade kit from 3rd party suppliers.|$|E

50|$|A <b>putty</b> <b>knife</b> is a {{specialized}} tool used when glazing single glazed windows, to work putty {{around the edges}} of each pane of glass. An experienced glazer will apply the putty by hand, and then smooth it with the knife. Modern insulated glazing may use other ways of securing the glass to the window frame.|$|E

50|$|Following his {{research}} on wings, Whitcomb again turned to a possible complete supercritical aircraft, and in 1971 he published preliminary details of a near-sonic transport (NST), which he predicted could attain a relatively efficient cruise at 0.98 Mach. As with his supercritical wing efforts, he had largely developed the design in the wind tunnel, shaping his proposed model with <b>putty</b> and <b>knife</b> until the various secondary shocks created by wing-body intersections were muted as much as possible. Whitcomb's NST proposal was not advanced beyond his concept stage.|$|R
5000|$|Dough scrapers, or pastry scrapers, {{are more}} rigid implements, often {{made of a}} metal {{rectangle}} with a wooden, plastic, or metal handle running along one long edge not only for more comfortable grip, but also to add rigidity; some bowl scrapers, however, {{are designed to be}} stiff enough to serve a dual purpose and are sold as such. Occasionally, an implement resembling a <b>putty</b> <b>knife</b> is sold for this purpose., ...|$|E
5000|$|The first written {{appearance}} of the generic {{use of the word}} [...] "spackle" [...] was around 1940. The product name was likely derived from the German word spachtel, meaning [...] "putty knife" [...] or [...] "filler". Other possible origins include Russian шпаклевать (tr. shpaklevat; to fill holes with putty or caulk), Polish szpachla (spatula or <b>putty</b> <b>knife)</b> and Yiddish spaklieven (to fill in small holes in plaster), all of which are likely derived from German.|$|E
50|$|Smith {{claimed to}} have downed the first legal drink in the United States once {{prohibition}} was repealed with the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution, and he wrote about the incident in Chapter VI of Life in a <b>Putty</b> <b>Knife</b> Factory. However, others also {{claimed to have}} taken the first Repeal drink; in New York City, Joe Weber of the comedy team Weber and Fields took the first legal drink with several reporters as his witnesses.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{wallpaper}} stripper can {{be purchased}} at most paint or home improvement stores. It is mixed with warm water or a mixture of warm water and vinegar, then sprayed onto wall surfaces. Several applications may be required to saturate the existing wallpaper. Perforation can aid in the absorption of the mixture and lead to faster removal. After the mixture has dissolved the wallpaper paste, the wallpaper can be removed easily by pulling at the edges and {{with the aid of a}} <b>putty</b> or drywall <b>knife.</b>|$|R
50|$|The mixture {{will set}} up, for handling, within 4-6 hours, but {{requires}} 15 hours (at cool temperatures) to fully cure and harden. When first mixed, J-B WELD {{is subject to}} sagging or running (slow dripping), more so at warmer temperatures. After about 20 minutes the mixture begins to thicken into a putty that can be shaped, which becomes hard after 4-6 hours. Within 3 hours (in cool temperatures), the putty can be shaped (with a <b>putty</b> <b>knife</b> or wooden paddle) into a weld bead or extruded shape.|$|E
50|$|A grill scraper is {{a device}} used to clean cooking grills by {{scraping}} stuck particles of food from their surface. For flat surfaced grills, their design {{can vary from}} similar to a <b>putty</b> <b>knife,</b> to a more complex device with provision to protect the hands from the hot grill surface, targeted to professional cooks and chefs, to even more complex models costing $100 American. Varieties sold for cleaning wire grills are also available, with notches in {{the edge of the}} blade to match the wires of the grill.|$|E
50|$|The pan scraper is, as {{the name}} suggests, an {{implement}} designed for the forcible removal of tightly stuck or burned food {{from the bottom of}} pots and pans before washing. They usually resemble a <b>putty</b> <b>knife</b> with a metal blade and a metal, wood, or plastic handle, sometimes with the handle mounted at an angle to the blade to allow for more vigorous scraping parallel to the surface; others, however, are a wedge shaped piece of hard plastic molded to fit the hand and with a slightly rounded sharp edge.|$|E
50|$|With {{his newfound}} {{financial}} freedom, {{he left the}} daily newspaper grind for life as a freelance author, scripting for radio while also writing (for six months) The Totem Pole, a daily column for United Features Syndicate, making personal appearances and working on his next book, Life in a <b>Putty</b> <b>Knife</b> Factory (1943), which became another bestseller. He spent eight months in Hollywood as a screenwriter for Paramount Pictures, and wrote about the experience in Lost in the Horse Latitudes (1944). His first three books were widely circulated {{around the world in}} Armed Services Editions. The popularity of these titles kept Smith on the New York Herald Tribunes Best Seller List for 100 weeks and prompted a collection of all three in 3 Smiths in the Wind (1946). By the end of World War II, Smiths fame as a humorist was such that he edited Desert Island Decameron (1945), a collection of essays and stories by such leading humorists as Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley and James Thurber. Histories of the Manhattan Project mention Desert Island Decameron because its the book Donald Hornig was reading when he was sitting in the Trinity Test tower babysitting the atomic bomb on July 15, 1945, the stormy night prior to the first nuclear explosion.|$|E

Noguchi and Robinson use a caulk gun and a <b>putty</b> <b>knife</b> to repair the sample tiles. The video contains several Earth views, including one of Baja California...|$|E
