50|$|A {{ballcock}} (also balltap or float valve) is {{a mechanism}} or machine for filling water tanks, {{such as those}} found in flush toilets, while avoiding overflow and (in the event of low water pressure) backflow. The modern ballcock was invented by José Antonio de Alzate y Ramírez, a Mexican priest and scientist, who described the device in 1790 in the Gaceta de Literatura Méxicana. It consists of a valve connected to a hollow sealed float {{by means of a}} lever, mounted {{near the top of the}} tank. The float is often ball-shaped, hence the name ballcock. The valve is connected to the incoming water supply, and is opened and closed by the lever which has the float mounted on the end. When the water level rises, the float rises with it; once it rises to a <b>pre-set</b> <b>level,</b> the mechanism forces the lever to close the valve and shut off the water flow. This is an example of negative feedback and of proportional control.|$|E
40|$|Abstract To {{deal with}} {{uncertain}} demand rates in stochastic periodic inventory routing problem (SPIRP), supply chain planners foresee an extra stock amount, known as “safety stock” at the retailers. This safety stock prevents stock-out from occurring {{and gives the}} supply chain planner the possibility to offer a level of service assurance to its retailers. The <b>pre-set</b> service <b>level</b> for the retailers guarantees the reliability of having the demand rates satisfied at a certain rate during the planning horizon. To prove the guaranteed service level at the retailers, the actual service level is measured through a simulation experiment. The results of the simulation show {{that the difference between}} the actual and <b>pre-set</b> service <b>level</b> does not behave linearly for the different scenarios. In addition, this non-linearity changes with the length of the planning horizon. Minimization of the difference between actual and expected service level results in saving the spent costs for the assurance of service at the retailers. In this paper, we evaluate the behavior of the actual service level compared to the <b>pre-set</b> service <b>level.</b> Also the effects on short/long term planning horizon is measured and analyzed. A case study of a distribution center is simulated to show how to optimize the inventory level and routing system with different planning horizons and <b>pre-set</b> service <b>levels...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{immediate}} question that arises {{is how do}} we characterize our uncertainty about the effect of full-day kindergarten program attendance on reading proficiency? This {{is referred to as the}} “elicitation problem”, which has been discussed in detail in O’Hagan et al. (2006), and is beyond the scope of this paper. However, following the discussion given in Kaplan (2014), the general approach to specifying a prior distribution for the causal effect is to consider first what is reasonable to believe about the effect and to further consider the source of our belief. This issue has also been discussed by Leamer (1983) who orders priors on the basis of degree of confidence. Leamer’s hierarchy of confidence is as follow: truths (e.g. axioms) > facts (data) > opinions (e.g. expert judgement) > conventions (e.g. <b>pre-set</b> alpha <b>levels).</b> An interesting feature of this hierarchy, as noted by Leamer, concerns the inherent lack of “objectivity” in such choices as <b>pre-set</b> alpha <b>levels,</b> or any of a number of conventions used in frequentist statistics. Leamer (1983) goes on to argue that the problem should be to articulate exactly where a given investigation is located on this hierarchy. The strength of Bayesian inference lies precisely in its ability to incorporate existing knowledge into statistical specifications.|$|R

In periods when demand exceeds the system’s supply capability, either because of unexpected high demand or supply disturbances, there is an inverse relationship between frequency and the price of electricity. So automatic load-shedding devices could also help buyers avoid price spikes.

Motor evoked {{potentials}} (MEPs) recorded from pharyngeal and anterior hyo-mandibular (submental) muscles at rest {{have been}} used to evaluate treatment effects on neural pathways underlying swallowing. This study documents a novel methodological approach of recording reliable intra- and inter-session MEPs at the submental muscle group during task-related volitional swallowing. MEPs were elicited by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), triggered by a custom-made system when a <b>pre-set</b> <b>level</b> of surface electromyographic activity in the target muscles was breached. Fifteen MEPs were recorded during each of four sessions. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess test-retest reliability within and across sessions for blocks of 3, 5, 10 and 15 trials. Highly reliable intra-session reliability was achieved, maximal for blocks of five trials (0. 915). Inter-session reliability varied between 0. 474 (three trials per block) and 0. 909 (10 trials per block). Surface electromyography-triggered TMS allows reliable measurement of MEP amplitude at the submental muscle group within and across sessions when muscles are pre-activated during volitional swallowing.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{demonstrate}} how Performance Objectives (POs) for Salmonella at various points in the broiler supply chain can be estimated, starting from <b>pre-set</b> <b>levels</b> of the PO in finished products. The estimations were performed using an analytical transmission model, based on prevalence data collected throughout the chain in The Netherlands. In the baseline (current) situation, the end PO was set at 2. 5 % of the finished products (at end of processing) being contaminated with Salmonella. Scenario analyses were performed by reducing this baseline end PO to 1. 5 % and 0. 5 %. The results showed the end PO could be reduced by spreading the POs over the various stages of the broiler supply chain. Sensitivity analyses were performed by changing the values of the model parameters. Results indicated that, in general, decreasing Salmonella contamination between points in the chain is more effective in reducing the baseline PO than increasing the reduction of the pathogen, implying contamination should be prevented rather than treated. Application of both approaches at the same time showed to be most effective in reducing the end PO, especially at the abattoir and during processing. The modelling approach of this study proved to be useful to estimate the implications for preceding stages of the chain by setting a PO at the end of the chain as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of potential interventions in reducing the end PO.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a new {{approach}} to renovation planning. The approach is based on the two models: one devaluation model and one renovation model. The proposed devaluation model is used to simulate the deterioration process taking place in a single component, a group of components or the whole building. The devaluation behavior is expressed through the employment of normalized values and the calendar time. Each component of the building has its own significance, so the normalized value of the whole building can be presented as a sum of normalized values of its components. The renovation model depends on the devaluation model as well as conditions and parameters applied by the user. For example, the user can attribute a certain value to a certain component and identify the level of renovation (the restored value). Thus, the two models consolidate into an integrated model. The input information is composed of the data about the physical state of the building, materials and mode of maintenance and operation.

40|$|Making {{investments}} into {{projects that}} contemplate reconstruction and renovation of residential housing is always accompanied by particular risks. Risky investments are highly profitable while low-risk investments {{have a low}} profit margin. The task of an investor is reduced to identification of the most desirable "risk income" {{in the course of}} the due diligence of a specific investment project. The authors present a formal approach to the management of a real estate investment project with account for the risks that may arise in the course of its development and implementation. We consider passive and proactive types of investment control. The problem of proactive management represents projecting potential investment project development patterns, ongoing monitoring of the market situation, involvement of profit generating assets, disposal of low-profit assets. The passive type of management involves compilation of a well-balanced mix of investment operations that contemplates a <b>pre-set</b> <b>level</b> of risk (for example, through reasonable diversifi cation) within an extensive period of time. Particular attention is driven to the optimal choice of an investment project based on the rate of return and risks. The profitability represents an average value, while the risk is identified by using the method of dispersion. Optimization of investment projects is performed on the basis of the profi tability-to-risk ratio. The main feature of this method is that the limits of an admissible risk aren't specified there, and the extent of risk correlates with the amount of potential revenues to be generated.

40|$|Post {{explosion}} residues (PER) are residues from pyrotechnic compositions or explosives {{that are}} generated during an explosion. In {{the recent past}} SEM/EDX was used several times to analyze PER from pyrotechnic compositions. The results from these studies suggest {{that there might be}} a difference in morphology and composition of pyrotechnic residues formed at different levels of confinement. Also because of general thermodynamic principles it is believed that at higher levels of confinement the final pressure and temperature during the explosion is probably (but not necessarily) higher, eventually resulting in smaller and more spherical particles and a more homogeneous elemental composition. If there is a relation between morphology and composition of pyrotechnic residues and the level of confinement at which these are formed, it would be possible to draw conclusions about the conditions at which pyrotechnic residues were formed and the kind and construction of the device used. This may aid forensic scientists not only in the determination of the original explosive composition, but also of the explosive device. To perform controlled experiments with pyrotechnic charges at, at least, two <b>pre-set</b> <b>levels</b> of confinement a test vessel was built by TNO Defence, Security and Safety. For this study, three different flash powder compositions and black powder were selected. The generated residues were sampled on collecting plates and Nucleopore filters connected to a pump system in the immediate vicinity of the venting area for further analyses by SEM/EDX and XRD. From the results it follows that in the pressure range studied, the level of confinement seems to have a minor effect on the features of the generated residue particles. Because passive sampling by means of collector plates seemed doubtful and because the number of experiments had to be limited it is impossible to draw definitive conclusions. In addition to the level of confinement several other variables may affect size, shape and composition of pyrotechnic residues. More experiments and improved sampling methods are necessary to determine what variables have the most pronounced effect on shape size and composition of pyrotechnic residues...|$|R
