500|$|An {{auction of}} Thomas' {{property}} {{was held at}} 2 Mayfield Cottages {{on the day after}} Webster's execution. John Church, the publican, managed to obtain Thomas' furniture after all, along with numerous other personal effects including her <b>pocket-watch</b> and the knife with which Thomas had been dismembered. The copper in which Thomas' body had been boiled was sold for five shillings. Other visitors contented themselves with taking small pebbles and twigs from the garden as souvenirs. The house itself remained unoccupied until 1897, as nobody would live there after the murder. Even then, according to the occupant, servants were reluctant to work at such a notorious place.|$|E

50|$|In 1874 Gruen filed {{a patent}} for a 'safety' pinion that {{prevented}} {{damage to a}} <b>pocket-watch</b> movement if the mainspring broke. In 1876 he started the Columbus Watch Manufacturing Company in Columbus, Ohio. In 1882 the company was reorganized as the Columbus Watch Company {{and moved to a}} building on Thurman Street. The company now saw itself as in the same ranks of older established American watch companies like Waltham Watch Company and Elgin National Watch Company.|$|E

50|$|The next morning, Owen asks Buffy out {{on another}} date and even {{gives her a}} <b>pocket-watch</b> so that she doesn't miss it this time. When evening comes, Giles shows up at Buffy's house, waving a {{newspaper}} that shows five people died when the bus crashed, among them the suspected murderer Andrew Borba, {{the man who was}} quoting prophecies. Buffy insists on going to the Bronze so Giles decides to check the Sunnydale funeral home himself. Unfortunately, there are vampires present to get the Anointed One, and they trap Giles in a room. Xander and Willow have followed him, though, and run back to The Bronze to get Buffy.|$|E
50|$|A {{special-purpose}} lathe, the Rose engine lathe, is {{also used}} for ornamental turning, in particular for engine turning, typically in precious metals, for example to decorate <b>pocket-watch</b> cases. As well as {{a wide range of}} accessories, these lathes usually have complex dividing arrangements to allow the exact rotation of the mandrel. Cutting is usually carried out by rotating cutters, rather than directly by the rotation of the work itself. Because of the difficulty of polishing such work, the materials turned, such as wood or ivory, are usually quite soft, and the cutter has to be exceptionally sharp. The finest ornamental lathes are generally considered to be those made by Holtzapffel {{around the turn of the}} 19th century.|$|E
50|$|Emily {{contacts}} paranormal investigator Joey Ross about strange {{events at}} Green Lanterns, including a ghostly apparition in the woodshed and threatening letters sent to Harriet in Emily's handwriting. One of them {{seems to say}} 'Beware the approach of Isis.' Joey and her investigative partner Jonathan Creek agree {{to take on the}} case. However shortly after their arrival they get stuck in a cellar, and Creek realises they mistook the handwriting and it means 15:15. Harriet is defenestrated, and identifies Emily as her killer, showing part of her dress at which point Emily sees a piece is missing, before dying in Hugo's arms. After Emily is arrested, Jonathan solves the 1988 mystery, postulating that house Emily saw was actually a standing film set which blew over in the wind when she turned away. He suggests that the man in the field was actually the site watchman, reaching out to Emily in an attempt to free himself from beneath the set. He and Joey continue their investigation at Green Lanterns, and Jonathan is also able to solve the second mystery. He deduces that Selima had a <b>pocket-watch</b> constructed for Dr Northcote containing lethal hydrogen cyanide, beneath a thin sheet of glass which could be shattered by a high-pitched noise at a specific tone. At the predicted time of his death, Dr Northcote took out his <b>pocket-watch,</b> and a nearby Selima screamed at the required frequency to break the glass, releasing the hydrogen cyanide which killed the doctor on the spot. She claimed to have screamed as she saw Death approaching. Jonathan additionally theorises that Hugo framed Emily for Harriet's death, but is unable to convince the jury at her trial, who find Emily guilty.|$|E
5000|$|During a boating trip, Nick Castle and {{his friend}} Spooner unwittingly disturb a bag {{containing}} a <b>pocket-watch</b> and a hairbrush from the Elizabeth Dane lying on the seabed. That night, Nick meets his former girlfriend, Elizabeth Williams, who has returned after being away for six months. Elizabeth is shown the antique <b>pocket-watch</b> by Machen, {{an old man who}} found it washed up on the beach. He warns her ominously [...] "if you touch it, things will change." [...] The watch begins ticking as Elizabeth holds it. She sees a hallmark on it, which includes a set of scales. Later, weird supernatural occurrences start to plague the town. Objects move by themselves, power outages occur, and the windows in Nick's truck inexplicably shatter. Nick and Elizabeth then encounter drunken priest Father Malone, who is ranting about murderers and retribution. Meanwhile, at the local radio station, host Stevie Wayne gets a phone call from weatherman Dan about a large fog bank off the coast. Out at sea on Nick's boat, Spooner and Nick's cousin Sean are partying with two young women, Mandi and Jennifer. As the fog reaches them, the boat's engine stops and the instruments break. An old clipper ship appears in the fog next to them. Seemingly possessed, Jennifer draws a set of scales on a misted window inside the boat. Unseen forces then kill Mandi, Jennifer and Sean. At Nick's beach house, Elizabeth has been dreaming about the Elizabeth Dane. She searches the Internet for information about the hallmark symbol she saw earlier, but her computer malfunctions and the word [...] "Dane" [...] appears on the screen. She hears a knock at the front door, goes outside but finds nothing. Walking down to the beach, the fog begins moving in but Nick brings her back inside.|$|E
5000|$|Second {{season was}} premiered {{in late summer}} of 2004, and {{production}} was continued on the very same tempo.Bogoljub Karić, infamous Serbian tycoon and candidate on Serbian presidential election, 2004, became important political figure, so he was featured in serial as the best friend of Ilić. Second New Year special was called [...] "The Untouchables in curve of Spacetime", and this time, characters were shown as favourite Eliot Ness (Labus), and his incapable colleagues (Koštunica, Tadić, Drašković). They are trying to prevent smugglers of dangerous „Jujubana" [...] whiskey (Karić and Ilić). When Koštunica turns back his <b>pocket-watch,</b> whole day before, 31 December 1931, is repeated. At the end, Ness managed to find {{what the problem is}} and has broken that watch. However, both he and his colleagues are already put in Sing-Sing prison.|$|E

It was later rumoured that a [...] "ghostly nun" [...] could be seen hovering over the place where Thomas had been buried. To the surprise and disappointment of Elliott O'Donnell, there was no sign that her house was haunted, and Guy Logan noted that the [...] "neat and pretty" [...] appearance of the property gave no hint of the crime that had been committed within: [...] "anything less like the popular conception of a 'murder house' {{it would be hard to}} imagine." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{young girl}} {{that tried to}} hire Zwei, {{thinking}} he was a killer for justice, by using money she had unknowingly stolen from Inferno. Zwei tries to hide her from Inferno but is unsuccessful and in a move {{to save her life}} asks that she becomes his assistant as he had been to Ein. After an attempt on his life, Zwei took her for dead and was forced to leave America to go into hiding. Cal believed that she had been left behind by Zwei and was manipulated by an exonerated Scythe, who turned her beliefs into full hatred for Zwei and trained her as his third assassin, Drei. Her clothing and situation-teenaged girl trying to hire an assassin to avenge her murdered sibling, beginning {{to fall in love with}} said assassin, and learning the art of killing herself-are very similar to those of the character Mathilda from the film Léon. In the anime she is a fan of old films. Her method of dueling, waiting until the music from the <b>pocket-watch</b> Reiji gave her has stopped, is a reference to For a Few Dollars More.|$|E

The aim {{of this article is to}} provide an in-depth study of the <b>pocket-watch,</b> using Three Dimensional Computed Tomography (3 D-CT) X-ray scanning. The structural information that survived exceeded expectations and made a virtual reconstruction of the mechanism possible. The very high resolution provided by the scan enabled the engraving of the maker's name to be visualised and confirmed the date of the watch...|$|E
40|$|Asthmatic and bronchitic {{attacks are}} often a {{reaction}} to air pollution. Such effects often fail to be detected during medical examinations, especially short-time sounding. To {{solve the problem of}} continuously monitoring human airway obstructions, an automatic miniature system was developed comprising the following elements: acoustic detector, frequency filter, recognition unit, registrator working on a time scale, data export module, power source. Wheezing was chosen as a characteristic pathological sound. Only typical frequencies are registered in a certain mode to optimize the likelihood of picking up true signals. The sensor is as small as a <b>pocket-watch.</b> It is fixed to the chest and worn there for a period of hours or days. Once the recording time is up, the sensor is returned to the physican. The data recorded are then transferred to a computer for evaluation. The sensor is currently being tested under field conditions on infants and schoolchildren...|$|E
