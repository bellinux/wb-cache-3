The Irish Government intends to achieve this target {{with a number of}} policies including an increase in the use of biofuels in transport by 3 % by 2010 and ensuring that 10 % of all vehicles in the transport fleet are powered by electricity by 2020. Electric vehicles (EVs) do not emit exhaust fumes {{in the same manner as}} traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. The optimal benefits of EVs can only be truly achieved if EVs are deployed effectively, so that exhaust pipe gaseous emissions are not fully displaced to the electricity sector. This paper examines the potential contributions that Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicles can make in reducing carbon dioxide. The paper presents the results of the generation expansion model for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland built using the dynamic programming based long term generation expansion planning tool called the Wien Automatic System Planning IV tool. The model optimizes power dispatch using hourly electricity demand curves for each year up to 2020, while incorporating generator characteristics and certain operational requirements such as energy not served and loss of load probability while satisfying constraints on environmental emissions, fuel availability and generator operational and maintenance costs. In order to simulate the effect of PHEV, two distinct charging scenarios are applied based on a <b>peak</b> <b>tariff</b> and an off <b>peak</b> <b>tariff.</b> The importance and influence of the charging regime on the amount of energy used and gaseous emissions displaced is determined and briefly discussed...|$|E

40|$|A new {{methodology}} for the optimization {{of the daily}} operations of a pumping plant has been developed. Two major issues have been investigated in relation to pump operations; maximizing pumping during off-peak electricity tariff periods and minimizing the head against which water is pumped. The new approach {{presented in this paper}} incorporates the combination of both a pump schedule and trigger levels to control the system. Different trigger levels are used during different periods of the day, such that peak pumping and pumping head are minimized. Additionally, scheduling is used to maximize pumping in the off-peak period thereby ensuring that the maximum amount of water is available in elevated storage facilities at the start of <b>peak</b> <b>tariff</b> periods. A genetic algorithm that incorporates realvalue and integer decision variables has been developed to determine the best combinations of trigger levels and scheduling for a predicted demand flow for the next day. The methodology has been applied to the Murray Bridge Water Treatment plant in South Australia. The current operating controls based on fixed trigger levels in the upper tank at this plant have been compared with the new combined scheduling/trigger levels operating controls approach. Very promising results have been obtained, with a 20 % saving predicted on energy costs during low and moderate demands. Michael D. Kazantzis, Angus R. Simpson, David Kwong, and Shyh Min Ta...|$|E
40|$|Although average tariffs in Quad {{markets are}} very low, <b>tariff</b> <b>peaks</b> and <b>tariff</b> {{escalation}} have a disproportional effect on exports from {{least developed countries}} (LDCs). <b>Tariff</b> <b>peak</b> products tend to be heavily concentrated in agriculture and food products and in labour-intensive sectors such as apparel and footwear.

The industrial sector is the second largest consumers of energy in Malaysia. In the present work sixty-four (64) factories in seven different manufacturing sectors were audited within the four regions of east-coast of Malaysia. In this audit, the most important parameters that have been collected are; power rating and operation time of energy consuming equipment/machinery; fossil fuel and other sources of energy consumption; production figure; peak and off <b>peak</b> <b>tariff</b> usage behavior; and power factor. These data were analyzed to investigate the breakdown of end-use equipment/machinery, the peak and off peak usage behavior, power factor trend, specific energy consumption and specific electricity consumption. The result of the energy audit shows that the highest energy consuming equipment is electric motor followed by liquid pumps and air compressor. The highest specific total energy (fossil fuel and electricity) consumption among the industrial sub-sectors is found in the rubber producing industries followed by fabricated metal industries, while the highest specific electrical energy consumption was found in the fabricated metal industries followed by rubber producing industries. The specific energy and electricity consumptions found in the present study are compared with Indonesian industrial sectors and presented in thin paper. The study also found that the 64 % electrical energy was consumed in peak hours by the industries and average power factor ranged from 0. 88 to 0. 91.

40|$|This report {{explores the}} {{potential}} for increasing imports to Norway from its main development partners. The analysis is based on three main indicators: i) a trade intensity index (commodities which the development partners are exporting, but where Norway is importing relatively less than similar OECD countries); ii) the <b>peak</b> <b>tariff</b> rates (commodities where tariff rates are high); and iii) the utilisation rate of commodities with preferential tariffs (commodities where the development partners are not fully utilising the preferences). In addition, {{interviews were conducted with}} Norwegian importers of clothing, toys, food and gifts to identify their problems when importing from developing countries. Finally, the report identifies persons and institutions with expertise on problems faced by developing countries when trying to penetrate the Norwegian market. We find that Norway is importing relatively less than other OECD countries from most of its development partners, particularly for agricultural products. Based on the trade intensity index, we identify a further import potential of products such as prawns, coffee, sugar, fruits and nuts. Norway has particularly high tariffs on clothing and agricultural products. Tariffs on clothing favour the least developed countries (LDCs) and members of the European Economic Area (EEA) at the cost of ordinary developing countries, which do not have preferential treatment. Extending such preferential treatment to all developing countries will spur imports from China in particular. From 1 July 2002, all imports from LDCs to Norway will have duty free access. In the short run, the import potential of agricultural products from LDCs seems limited, since these countries are net importers of the relevant product categories. The utilisation rate of Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) in Norway is about 80 percent and China is the primary beneficiary. We argue for targeting the GSP system towards LDCs. We also argue that Norway should liberalise its rules of origin for clothing products in order to increase the utilisation rate.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project was to modify an existing software programme, QUICKControl (which was originally designed for ventilation and cooling applications in the building industry), to be applicable to mine water pumping systems. The ultimate objective was to then use this modified programme to enable energy management and control of these systems. The existing component models in this software program, i. e. pumps, valves, flow converges and diverges, were modified for the {{purpose of this}} study, and a new model of a thermal storage darn was incorporated into the software. The predictions made by the simulation software were verified with the actual measured data from the system's operation. Measured data such as dam levels, water flow rates and active pumps were used for verification purposes. After completion of the verification study, various energy investigations were conducted to study the potential of Demand Side Management on the system's operation. The total pumped volume of water from the underground workings to the surface dam were verified within a 1 % error compared against the actual measured data. The various dam levels were verified with errors ranging from 0. 19 % to 8. 08 %. Total energy usage of the system was verified with an error less than 5 % compared to the measured energy usage of the system. The energy studies revealed the potential of shifting a load of approximately 70000 kWh (out of the <b>peak</b> <b>tariff</b> periods) from the daily operation, with a maximum demand shift of 14 MW over 5 hours. The study showed that it was possible to accurately simulate the operation of the pumping systems. This simulation was then used to predict the operation of the system when specific control strategies were implemented. Results showed that these new strategies would improve plant operation as well as save the mine significant energy costs. Master...|$|E

The {{findings suggest that}} demand management and engagement activities need to go beyond individually motivating family households to save money, protect the environment, or make better choices in the electricity market. Overview Family households represent 25 % of Australian households and face particular challenges {{as a result of}} rapid changes in the energy market and pricing structures. The Changing Demand: Flexibility of Energy Practices in Households with Children Project investigates how energy demand is changing in households with children and the likely implications of more cost-reflective network tariffs for this consumer group. This interim report discusses the findings from in-depth interviews conducted with 44 family households which will inform a national survey later in 2014. Children’s needs came first and daily routines enabled family households to manage the range of competing priorities and activities. Household activities in the late afternoon and early evening were highly coordinated and coincided with <b>peak</b> <b>tariff</b> period for Time-of-Use (TOU) electricity pricing. Family practices held meanings which are distinct from how these practices are valued and performed in other types of households. In particular, family health, children’s ongoing development, providing practical life skills, and enabling fun and socialisation were valued benefits. Energy use changed as children aged and went through various stages of life development and as new practice expectations emerged and changed with the introduction of new technologies, changing house design, increasing energy costs, and changing priorities. Information and communications technology (ICT) practices was the biggest area of concern and rapid change for family households and many parents felt they had little ‘control’ over their children’s usage. Parents’ were often conflicted about the potential health and wellbeing impacts of their children’s ICT use with the potential educational, development and communication functionalities these devices might provide. These competing priorities and concerns took precedence over any ICT-related energy concerns. Electricity usage was not a key consideration in other everyday activities or priorities despite rising electricity bills being a common concern or contributor to financial stress for family households. Most householders had low levels of energy literacy and engagement and felt unable to make appropriate choices about electricity tariffs and providers, and some were consciously disengaging from the current energy market focus on energy choices. Many were uncertain about their current electricity tariff. It was not practicable for most family households to change their routines to respond to a TOU tariff. Rapid change in family householders added to concerns about the financial impact of a TOU tariff on family households.   Family households were flexible and adaptable in response to the ‘normal’ disruptions of everyday family life. Most householders were willing to shift their routines in response to occasional alerts about critical peak demand. They described concerns for the ‘common good’ and the need to work together for social benefits or health and wellbeing of others (distinct from personal financial gain or environmental benefits). The findings suggest that current consumer demand management and engagement activities need to go beyond individually motivating family households to save money, protect the environment, or make better choices in the electricity market. Peak alerts, framed as a natural event or an ‘exceptional circumstance’ that benefits a common good and assists reliable and affordable access to electricity, is a potentially agreeable and productive strategy for engaging families to reduce energy use at times of peak demand...|$|E

Of the reviewed papers, only four considered peak/off-peak time-dependent tariffs [C 13] (Pr 6, Pr 8, Pr 33, Pr 34). Biehl and Inman (2010) (Pr 6) discussed {{the ways in which}} electricity is charged to the consumer, and suggested ways in which both energy usage and its associated costs can be reduced. Both time dependent charges, including peak and off <b>peak</b> <b>tariffs,</b> which charge for the actual amount of electricity used with a rate based on the time of usage, and time-independent charges, including demand charges, which charge for the highest demand reached over either the billing period, or a prescribed period of time, were considered. While a demand charge can account for 10 - 20 % of a water utility’s electricity costs, it is suggested that the majority of these costs can be attributed to tariff charges (Pr 6). Ramos et al. (2011) (Pr 34) showed that optimizing pump operations while considering peak/off-peak electricity tariffs can result in cost reductions by pumping during off-peak times. One study also looked at the effect of longer term changes to electricity costs. Wu et al.

With rising population and incomes, domestic markets offer great opportunities for farmers. However, because of structural, institutional and organizational constraints, small scale rural farmers may not benefit much from domestic urban markets unless they are organized and trained to meet the high quality product standards demanded by urban consumers and supermarkets. ECA countries stand to gain more by investing in commodities that are consumed within the region, than from traditional cash crops destined for international markets. Regional integration offers opportunities for larger markets and efficiency gains and this is happening, although countries still {{have to do more}} to ease the flow of goods across the region, including joint investments in infrastructure to link markets, harmonizing trade policies, and removing trade barriers that limit cross-border trade. Access to international markets remains constrained because of trade distorting practices in developed countries, especially <b>tariff</b> <b>peaks</b> and <b>tariff</b> escalation, domestic support to their farmers, and export subsidies.

The aim is to show various ways in which tariffs on South African imports can be analysed such that DTI can develop in-house capacity to undertake such analysis on an on-going basis. A cursory comparison with earlier analysis suggests that tariffs have declined over the period 1997 - 2001, notably for manufacturing. However, further tariff liberalisation has been slow in last couple of years. <b>Tariff</b> <b>peaks</b> still exist {{for a number of}} broad categories of commodities such as processed foods (HS 0 - 2), vehicles and components thereof (HS 87), tobacco products (HS 24), rubber products (HS 40) and clothing and textiles (HS 6).

In section II, we move from the fundamentals to specific issues of implementing time-varying prices. We begin by describing illustrative Realtime Pricing and Critical <b>Peak</b> Pricing <b>tariffs</b> that are in use today. We then address the actual development of dynamic retail prices. In section III, we examine the ways in which customers respond to time-varying and dynamic prices. We discuss both the potential responses that are envisioned by those who study optimization of power use and the actual responses that have taken place in pilot and long-term programs. We conclude in section IV by advocating much wider use of dynamic retail pricing, under which prices faced by end-use customers can be adjusted frequently and on short notice to reflect changes in wholesale prices and the supply/demand balance...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{investigation}} was to characterize the manual and automated response of residential customers to high-price "critical" events dispatched under critical <b>peak</b> pricing <b>tariffs</b> tested in the 2003 - 2004 California Statewide Pricing Pilot. The 15 -month experimental tariff gave customers a discounted two-price time-of-use rate on 430 days in exchange for 27 critical days, during which the peak period price (2 p. m. to 7 p. m.) was increased to about three times the normal time-of-use peak price. We calculated response by five-degree temperature bins as the difference between peak usage on normal and critical weekdays. Results indicated that manual response to critical periods reached - 0. 23 kW per home (- 13 percent) in hot weather (95 - 104. 9 oF), - 0. 03 kW per home (- 4 percent) in mild weather (60 - 94. 9 oF), and - 0. 07 kW per home (- 9 percent) during cold weather (50 - 59. 9 oF). Separately, we analyzed response enhanced by programmable communicating thermostats in high-use homes with air-conditioning. Between 90 oF and 94. 9 oF, the response of this group reached - 0. 56 kW per home (- 25 percent) for five-hour critical periods and - 0. 89 kW/home (- 41 percent) for two-hour critical periods...|$|R
40|$|Road pricing aims {{to reduce}} the amount that is driven and thereby it can reduce the number of road {{accidents}} and casualties. The SWOV has calculated the road safety effects following the introduction of a road pricirig scheme called 'Anders Betalen voor Mobiliteit'. This road pricing scheme has a different aeffect on the use of passenger cars, heavy goods vehicles and minivans whereas it has no aeffect on other modes (e. g. cycling and motorcycling). Furthermore, a different payment for mobility affects the number ofvehicle kilometres driven on the major and minor road networks in- and outside the built up areas in different ways. By applying the most commonly occurring confficts (e. g. car-bicycle) to the modelled traffic exposure (vehicle-kms driven) of the different transport modes and on the different road networks, estimates of the road safety effects could be calculated. Depending on the modelled scenario, the pricing strategy and the introduction of a <b>peak</b> hour <b>tariff,</b> a different payment for mobility can result in between 3, 7 % and 6, 9 % fewer traffic related fatalities in the target year 2020. The resulting benefit to society will amount to a saving of € 450 to € 850 million annually. (Author/publisher...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{tries to}} analyse Turkey’s {{position}} and constraints in the WTO Nonagricultural Market Access Negotiations (NAMA) especially vis-à-vis developing countries. It basically, underlines Turkey’s unique negotiating position; de jure developing, de facto an advanced economy {{status in the}} WTO Doha NAMA negotiations. At Doha Ministerial Meeting in 2001, WTO members agreed to initiate negotiations to further liberalize trade, among other areas, on non-agricultural goods. For this purpose, the Negotiating Group on Market Access (NGMA) was created at {{the first meeting of}} the Trade Negotiations Committee of the WTO, in early 2002. Turkey has been quite active since then in NAMA negotiations in calibrating its position between offensive and defensive negotiation interests although its offensive market access interests largely outweigh defensive one. Turkey has also been propagating an offensive non-linear tariff cutting Swiss Formula approach at the WTO to curb the international high <b>tariffs,</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>peaks</b> and escalations. Having a strong offensive market access interests, Turkey mainly aims at large developing country markets diversifying its trade portfolio away from traditional markets towards large developing economies. From the perspective of governance, Turkey has serious constraints on its trade and industry policy space stemming from the Turkey-EU Customs Union (CU). Although Turkey is a de jure developing country in the WTO and will have all legal rights and mobligations stemming from the outcome of the DOHA, in practice, Turkey will have to implement the same applied common external tariffs of the EU. Despite the constraints and dilemmas stemming from the EU-Turkey customs union, it can be strongly argued that, it is in Turkey’s industrial interests to be actively involved in the WTO to tackle the high <b>tariffs,</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>peaks</b> and escalations which hinders Turkey’s exports to the world markets...|$|R
40|$|This study {{proposes a}} CGE {{assessment}} of multilateral liberalisation of non-agricultural market access. Scenarios considered include the so-called Girard proposal (with alternative {{choices for the}} involved coefficient), the removal of <b>tariff</b> <b>peaks</b> and complete liberalisation. This study {{is the first one}} to take duly into account the difference between bound and applied tariffs, while accounting for all enforced preferential trade arrangements and computing tariff cuts at the detailed product level (HS- 6 classification). While non-agricultural market access liberalisation is found to be welfare-enhancing at the world level, cross-country distributive impacts prove significant. A soft liberalisation would not lower significantly applied duties in developing countries, due to their significant binding overhang. In contrast, a deep liberalisation would entail fierce price-competition between developing countries, largely specialised on similar sectors and on the same quality range...|$|R
