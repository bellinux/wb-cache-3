60|$|When a {{revolving}} tendril strikes against a stick, the branches quickly bend round and clasp it. The little hooks here {{play an important}} part, as they prevent the branches from being dragged away by the rapid revolving movement, before they {{have had time to}} clasp the stick securely. This is especially the case when only the extremity of a branch has caught hold of a support. As soon as a tendril has bent a smooth stick or a thick rugged post, or has come into contact with <b>planed</b> <b>wood</b> (for it can adhere temporarily even to so smooth a surface as this), the same peculiar movements may be observed as those described under Bignonia capreolata and Eccremocarpus. The branches repeatedly lift themselves up and down; those which have their hooks already directed downwards remaining in this position and securing the tendril, whilst the others twist about until they succeed in arranging themselves in conformity with every irregularity of the surface, and in bringing their hooks into contact with the wood. The use of the hooks was well shown by giving the tendrils tubes and slips of glass to catch; for these, though temporarily seized, were invariably lost, either during the re- arrangement of the branches or ultimately when spiral contraction ensued.|$|E

40|$|Scanning of unplaned, green {{hardwood}} lumber has received relatively little {{attention in the}} research community. This has been {{due in part to}} the difficulty of clearly imaging fresh-cut boards whose fibrous surfaces mask many wood features. Nevertheless, it is important to improve lumber processing early in the manufacturing stream because much wood material is needlessly edged and trimmed away each day. This paper describes a prototype system that scans rough, green lumber and automatically generates a board profile and recognizes important lumber-degrading defects. This portion of the overall “improved edging and trimming project ” is primarily concerned with image acquisition and analysis. Commercially available laser sources and a video camera obtain thickness and reflectance information at 1 / 16 -inch resolution. The resulting images are analyzed in order to detect wane and surface defects. Unlike most board-scanning systems, which process <b>planed</b> <b>wood,</b> this system has been designed specifically for use with unplaned boards in the green state. This presents both advantages and challenges in the development of image-analysis algorithms. The current system is described and some preliminary tests specimens are exampled.

These materials reflect a typical composition and void fraction of so-called refuse- derived fuels (RDF), which are obtained from municipal solid waste, then densified and combusted for energy recovery. An infrared pyrometer, with a spectral response range of 8 to 14 μm, recorded the surface temperature of the surrogate RDF, prior to {{the onset of the}} flaming combustion, in a stand alone mass loss calorimeter operated at 20 and 45 kW m- 2. The overlapping spectral ranges of the pyrometer and the radiator heater necessitated the development of a practical methodology to obtain the actual surface temperature from the apparent measurements, which included the effect of the reflected radiation. In addition to surface temperatures (292 – 325 °C for 20 kW m- 2 and 250 – 294 °C for 45 kW m- 2), in this contribution, we estimate the actual emissivities (0. 95 – 0. 98) of the materials from the intensity of the reflected radiation...|$|E
