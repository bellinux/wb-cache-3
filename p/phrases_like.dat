That means, that the Genitive 1 is used for <b>phrases</b> <b>like</b> žekʼu-s is (the man's bull), and the Genitive 2 is used for žekʼu-z is-er (for the man's bull).|$|E
25|$|Mettā meditation, or often loving-kindness meditation, is the {{practice}} {{concerned with the}} cultivation of Mettā, i.e. benevolence, kindness and amity. The practice generally consists of silent repetitions of <b>phrases</b> <b>like</b> “may you be happy” or “may you be free from suffering”, for example directed at a person who, depending on tradition, {{may or may not}} be internally visualized.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit {{priest in}} the US {{published}} “Building a Bridge: How the Catholic Church and the L.G.B.T. Community Can Enter Into a Relationship of Respect, Compassion and Sensitivity.” This called on church leaders to show respect by using terms like “gay” and “L.G.B.T.,” instead of <b>phrases</b> <b>like</b> “afflicted with same-sex attraction.” He {{also argued that}} to expect a sinless lifestyle from gay Catholics, but not from any other group, {{is a form of}} “unjust discrimination” and that gay people should not be fired for marrying a same-sex spouse. Cardinal Joseph Tobin and Cardinal Kevin Farrell contributed blurbs to the book.|$|E

This phrase was used in both administrative and judicial contexts. If they were acting in an administrative capacity, schout en schepenen may be expressed in English as [...] "the mayor and aldermen" [...] (or a similar <b>phrase</b> <b>like</b> [...] "the mayor and councillors"). If they were acting in a judicial capacity, schout en schepenen may be expressed in English as [...] "magistrate's court" [...] (or a similar <b>phrase</b> <b>like</b> [...] "magistrates' bench" [...] or [...] "aldermen's court").|$|R
25|$|Although {{children}} perceive {{rhythmic patterns}} {{in their native}} language at 7–8 months, they {{are not able to}} reliably distinguish compound words and phrases that differ only in stress placement, such as ‘HOT dog’ vs. ‘hot DOG’ until around 12 years of age. Children in a study by Vogel and Raimy (2002) were asked to show which of two pictures (i.e., a dog or a sausage) was being named. Children younger than 12 years generally preferred the compound reading (i.e., the sausage) to the phrasal reading (the dog). The authors concluded from this that children start out with a lexical bias, i.e., they prefer to interpret <b>phrases</b> <b>like</b> these as single words, and the ability to override this bias develops until late in childhood.|$|E
500|$|A trait which {{persists}} {{in a population}} is often assumed by biologists to have been selected for {{in the course of}} evolution, raising the question of how the trait achieves this.

500|$|The Persian {{language}} is traditionally lacking a black/blue/green distinction. The Persian word سبز sabz can mean [...] "green", [...] "black", or [...] "dark". Thus, Persian erotic poetry, dark-skinned women are addressed as sabz-eh, as in <b>phrases</b> <b>like</b> سبز گندم گون sabz-eh-gandom-gun (literally [...] "dark wheat colored") or سبز مليح sabz-eh-malih ("a dark beauty").

500|$|Harlan's {{jurisprudence}} {{is often}} characterized as conservative. He held precedent {{to be of}} great importance, adhering {{to the principle of}} stare decisis more closely than many of his Supreme Court colleagues. Unlike Justice Black, he eschewed strict textualism.

5000|$|Double possession: The double genitive of English, {{which we}} can see in a <b>phrase</b> <b>like</b> a friend of mine, {{although}} seemingly pleonastic, and therefore has been stigmatized, {{has a long history}} of use by careful writers and has been analyzed as either a partitive genitive or an appositive genitive.|$|R
5000|$|The {{term has}} also been used as an {{approbation}} or form of praise.

500|$|The call {{is mostly}} uttered in flight {{and is a}} harsh [...] "tsak tsak tsuk". The same sound, but softer, is made more conversationally when {{individuals}} gather in trees. When angry or alarmed they emit various warning sounds reminiscent of the mistle thrush (Turdus viscivorous). The male has a rather feeble song that he sings in the breeding season. It {{is a mixture of}} a few <b>phrases</b> <b>like</b> those of the common blackbird (Turdus merula) interspersed with whistles, guttural squeaks and call notes. This is sung on the wing and also from a tree and a subdued version of this song with more warbling notes is sung by a group of birds at communal roosts.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} considered screening {{the first}} part of the season premiere at Comic-Con in San Diego, but ultimately decided against it because they thought the scene [...] "ends in such an exciting way that we were afraid to let it out". As a promotion, Fox did send out a DVD [...] "screener" [...] package of the premiere to certain journalists, which included a copy of the New York Times article shown in the first season finale as well as a piece of paper with a list of typed phrases. The paper was a copy of the instructions one of the shapeshifters received on the typewriter, which included <b>phrases</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Mission Accomplished" [...] and [...] "Target Terminated".|$|E
500|$|The Boston-born American author Edith Shillue {{wrote in}} her 2003book Peace Comes Dropping Slow that when the Irish stereotyped Americans, they tended to use the phrase [...] "have a nice day". While lodging at a house in Ireland, Shillue found a drawing on the wall for American {{visitors}} like her. Drawn by her host's daughters, the picture had the phrase [...] "Havea______Day", with a smiley faced affixed instead of the word [...] "nice". Irish author Aidan Higgins wrote in his 2004 book A Bestiary that the Americanization of Ireland led the Irish to say <b>phrases</b> <b>like</b> [...] "No problem!" [...] or [...] "Have a nice day!"

500|$|Northern English accents {{have not}} {{undergone}} the TRAP–BATH split, {{and a common}} shibboleth to distinguish them from Southern ones is the Northern use of the short a (the near-open front unrounded vowel) in words such as bath and castle. On the opposite border, most Northern English accents can be distinguished from Scottish accents because they are non-rhotic, although a few rhotic Lancashire accents remain. Other features common to many Northern English accents are {{the absence of the}} FOOT–STRUT split (so put and putt are homophones), the reduction of the definite article the to a glottal stop (usually represented in writing as t), and the T-to-R rule that leads to the pronunciation of t as a rhotic consonant in words and <b>phrases</b> <b>like</b> matter (...) and get up (...)

500|$|The show's {{standard}} opening sequence interplays {{images of}} the glyph symbols alongside words representing fringe science topics, such as [...] "teleportation" [...] and [...] "dark matter". Within the third season, with episodes that took place primarily in the parallel universe, {{a new set of}} titles was used, following a similar format, though tinted red instead of blue and using alternate fringe science concepts like [...] "hypnosis" [...] and [...] "neuroscience". The difference in color has led some fans to call the prime universe the Blue one in contrast to the parallel Red one. In the third-season episode [...] "Entrada", the titles used a mix of both the blue- and red-tinted versions, given that the episode took place equally in each universe. In the two flashback episodes, [...] "Peter" [...] and [...] "Subject 13," [...] a variation on the sequence, using retro graphics akin to 1980s technology and <b>phrases</b> <b>like</b> [...] "personal computing" [...] and [...] "genetic engineering," [...] was used. For the dystopian future third-season episode [...] "The Day We Died," [...] a black-toned theme, with more dire <b>phrases</b> <b>like</b> [...] "hope" [...] and [...] "water," [...] was used. The fourth-season premiere, [...] "Neither Here Nor There" [...] introduced an amber-toned title sequence with additional new terms that is used for nearly all fourth-season episodes. The fourth-season episode [...] "Letters of Transit," [...] which returned to the future dystopian universe, and the subsequent fifth-season episodes, feature a cold-toned title sequence with phrases such as [...] "joy," [...] "private thought," [...] "free will," [...] and [...] "freedom," [...] ideas which have been lost in this future. There is one frame in the opening sequence in which the words [...] "Observers are here" [...] flash very quickly, and the opening sequence must be paused to see them.|$|E

Isaac Hayes, who does the voice of Chef, recorded all his lines via phone from New York; Parker and Stone said they were nervous to ask him to repeat the line, [...] "Now I know how all those white women felt", but he had no problem repeating it.

500|$|For {{the rest}} of the 1920s, Arizonas service {{consisted}} of routine training exercises. Naval historian Paul Stillwell remarked that [...] "the Pacific years included a great deal of sameness and repetition", and his chronology of the ship's movements is filled with <b>phrases</b> <b>like</b> [...] "torpedo-defense practice", [...] "battle-practice rehearsal", [...] "gunnery practice", [...] "en route to…", and [...] "anchored at…". A recurring theme in these years were the annual Fleet Problems, which began in 1923 and simulated large fleet actions by having most of the active fleet face off against each other. The first two simulated an attack on the Panama Canal from the west, while in 1925 they attempted to defend the Hawaiian Islands. Other 1920s Fleet Problems included the Caribbean, near Central America, the West Indies, and Hawaii. On 27 July 1923 the ship joined President Warren G. Harding's naval review in Seattle. Harding died just one week later, and Arizona joined the Pacific Fleet to fire a salute in his honor on 3 August.|$|E
500|$|Killer Instinct Gold is a port of {{the arcade}} {{fighting}} video game Killer Instinct2.
