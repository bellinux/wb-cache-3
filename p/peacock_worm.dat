5000|$|The <b>peacock</b> <b>worm</b> (Sabella pavonina) is {{a marine}} polychaete worm {{belonging}} to the family Sabellidae. It occurs along the coasts of Western Europe and the Mediterranean. It is found in shallow, tidal waters with a bed of mud, sand or gravel. It is sometimes found on rocks or shipwrecks.|$|E
50|$|Sabellida is a {{suborder}} of annelid worms in {{the class}} Polychaeta. They are filter feeders with no buccal organ. The prostomium is fused with the peristomium and bears a ring of feathery feeding tentacles. They live in parchment-like tubes made of particles from their environment such as sand and shell fragments cemented together with mucus. Members of the suborder include the feather duster worms (Sabellidae) and serpulid worms (Serpulidae). Among the species are the giant feather duster worm (Eudistylia polymorpha), the <b>peacock</b> <b>worm</b> (Sabella pavonina), the European fan worm (Sabella spallanzanii) and the Christmas tree worm (Spirobranchus giganteus).|$|E
40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) {{and some}} {{organochlorine}} pesticides we re measured in some marine organisms of different trophic levels, sampled in the Belgian coastal waters. Because of their persistence and their lipophilic character they accumulate in lipoidal tissues, causing higher organochlorine residue levels in animals {{with a high}} adiposity. To compare the residue levels of different organisms lipid based data must be used. The concept of biological magnification controlled by mass transfers of residues through food chains is questioned because predatory fish like cod contained similar or even lower residue levels than organisms of a lower trophic levellike the <b>peacock</b> <b>worm.</b> This supports the concept that the organochlorine levels are controlled by the equilibrium partitioning of the lipophilic pollutants between body lipids and surrounding water. Nevertheless this equilibrium partitioning appeared to be slow so that other factors like sampling period (before or after spawning) could influence the residue level...|$|E
