25|$|Specialized transmembrane {{proteins}} {{recognize the}} substance and {{allow it to}} move across the membrane when it otherwise would not, either because the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane is impermeable to the substance moved or because the substance is moved against the direction of its concentration gradient. There are two forms of active transport, primary active transport and secondary active transport. In primary active transport, the proteins involved are pumps that normally use the chemical energy in the form of ATP. Secondary active transport, however, makes use of potential energy, which are usually derived through exploitation of an electrochemical gradient. This involves pore-forming proteins that form channels across the cell membrane. The difference between <b>passive</b> <b>transport</b> and active transport is active transport requires energy and moves substances against their respective concentration gradient, whereas <b>passive</b> <b>transport</b> requires no energy and moves substances in the direction of their respective concentration gradient.|$|E

If the process uses chemical energy, such as from adenosine triphosphate (ATP), it is termed primary active transport. Secondary active transport {{involves the use of}} an electrochemical gradient. Examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose in the intestines in humans and the uptake of mineral ions into root hair cells of plants.|$|E

25|$|As a {{phospholipid}} bilayer, the lipid {{portion of}} the outer membrane is impermeable to charged molecules. However, channels called porins {{are present in the}} outer membrane that allow for <b>passive</b> <b>transport</b> of many ions, sugars and amino acids across the outer membrane. These molecules are therefore present in the periplasm, the region between the cytoplasmic and outer membranes. The periplasm contains the peptidoglycan layer and many proteins responsible for substrate binding or hydrolysis and reception of extracellular signals. The periplasm is thought to exist in a gel-like state rather than a liquid due to the high concentration of proteins and peptidoglycan found within it. Because of its location between the cytoplasmic and outer membranes, signals received and substrates bound are available to be transported across the cytoplasmic membrane using transport and signalling proteins imbedded there.|$|E

40|$|The major pathway {{of passive}} K influx (ouabain-insensitive) was {{characterized}} in low-K type (LK) red cells of sheep. 1. <b>Passive</b> K <b>transport</b> in these cells was highly sensitive to variations in cell volume; it increased threefold {{or more in}} cells swollen osmotically by 10 %, and decreased up to twofold in cells shrunken 5 - 10 %. Active K influx was insensitive to changes in cell volume. Three different methods for varying cell volume osmotically all gave similar results. 2. The volume-sensitive pathway was specific for K in that Na influx did not vary with changes in cell volume. 3. The volume-sensitive K influx was a saturable function of external K concentration. It was slightly inhibited by Na, whereas K influx in shrunken cells was unaffected by Na. 4. Passive K influx was dependent on the major anion in the medium in that replacement of Cl with any of six other anions resulted in a reduction of K influx by 50 - 80 % (replacement of Cl by Br caused an increase in K influx). The activation of K influx by Cl followed sigmoid kinetics. 5. Passive K influx is inhibited by anti-L antibody.

40|$|The transmembrane {{exchange}} of Na+, K+, and Cl- in slowly and rapidly adapting lobster stretch receptor neurones was studied using ion-sensitive microelectrodes {{in combination with}} conventional electrophysiological techniques. The investigation was founded {{on the assumption that}} the transmembrane ion exchange is accomplished by active and <b>passive</b> <b>transports</b> which add up to zero in steady state for each ion involved. The active transports are assumed to include Na+ and K+ transports driven by an electrogenic Na-K pump. To these transports are also added equimolar fluxes of K+ and Cl- leaking from the impaling micro-electrode. The <b>passive</b> <b>transports</b> are assumed to pass through membrane channels in accordance with constant field kinetics. For a quantitative evaluation of the transmembrane ion exchange in resting conditions measurements were made of the resting concentrations of Na+, K+ and Cl-; the voltage dependence of the ungated leak current; and ouabain-induced changes in resting membrane current and intracellular ion concentrations. From the results it follows that both the resting pump current and the leak permeabilities for the ions investigated have values which do not seem to differ between slowly and rapidly adapting receptor neurones. For a quantitative evaluation of the relation between internal Na+ and pump current production, measurements were made of the outward membrane current as a function of internal Na+ and K+ following a shift of these ions by means of prolonged repetitive impulse activation. It was found that the investigated relation is compatible with Garay-Garrahan kinetics (Garay & Garrahan, 1973) in both receptor neurones, but the results imply a larger maximum Na+-extrusion capacity in slowly than in rapidly adapting cells. From recordings of the time course of post-tetanic normalization of both the membrane current and intracellular Na+ concentration, cell volume values could be deduced which were closely similar in slowly and rapidly adapting receptors. A corresponding similarity was also found for the cell area which was derived from membrane capacitance measurements...|$|R

40|$|To avoid large {{changes in}} cell K+ content and volume during {{variations}} in Na+,K+-ATPase activity, Na+-transporting epithelia must adjust {{the rate of}} K+ exit through passive permeability pathways. Recent {{studies have shown that}} a variety of <b>passive</b> K+ <b>transport</b> mechanisms may coexist within a cell and may be functionally linked to the activity of the Na+,K+-ATPase. In this study, we have identified three distinct pathways for <b>passive</b> K+ <b>transport</b> that act in concert with the Na+,K+-ATPase to maintain intracellular K+ homeostasis in the proximal tubule. Under control conditions, the total K+ leak of the tubules consisted of discrete Ba 2 +-sensitive (approximately 65 %), quinine-sensitive (approximately 20 %), and furosemide-sensitive (approximately 10 %) pathways. Following inhibition of the principal K+ leak pathway with Ba 2 +, the tubules adaptively restored cell K+ content to normal levels. This recovery of cell K+ content was inhibited, in an additive manner, by quinine and furosemide. Following adaptation to Ba 2 +, the tubules exhibited a 30 % reduction in Na+-K+ pump rate coupled with an increase in K+ leak by means of the quinine-sensitive (approximately 70 %) and furosemide-sensitive (approximately 280 %) pathways. Thus, the proximal tubule maintains intracellular K+ homeostasis by the coordinated modulation of multiple K+ transport pathways. Furthermore, these results suggest that, like Ba 2 +, other inhibitors of K+ conductance will cause compensatory changes in both the Na+-K+ pump and alternative pathways for <b>passive</b> K+ <b>transport...</b>|$|R

The effect of peritubular protein removal on the paracellular permeability to NaCl was examined using transepithelial specific resistance. Eight PCT were perfused with ultrafiltrate (UF) and bathed in either serum or UF. Transepithelial specific resistance averaged 14. 5 +/- 1. 9 in the presence and 13. 7 +/- 1. 7 omega cm 2 {{in the absence of}} peritubular protein. The effect of peritubular protein removal on the convective flow of a NaCl solution across functional complexes was {{examined in the}} absence of active transport by using colloid osmotic pressure (COP) gradients. 12 PCT were perfused with simple salt solutions in Donnan equilibrium with and without protein at 20 degrees C. A COP gradient of 60. 1 and - 60. 1 mmHg drove only 0. 06 and - 0. 23 nl/min, respectively. These values are approximately 10 % of the value predicted for an effect of peritubular protein on NaCl solution flow (1. 98 nl/min) and are approximately equal to the value predicted for pure water equilibration for the small osmotic pressure difference between solutions in Donnan equilibrium (0. 17 - 0. 18 nl/min). The effect of peritubular protein removal on the passive absorption of NaCl driven by anion concentration gradients was examined in seven PCT perfused with a high chloride solution simulating late proximal tubular fluid and bathed in either serum or UF at 20 degrees C.
