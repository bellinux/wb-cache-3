40|$|We use a {{behavioral}} laboratory experiment {{to study how}} agents with reputation concerns select the difficulty of their tasks. Drawing upon existing theory, we subjected participants in our study to {{a context in which}} they had to convince a principal of their capability to reap financial benefits. Our results show that participants tended to increase the difficulty of their task to enhance their reputation. In addition, we provide evidence that <b>performance</b> <b>rewards</b> reduce a less capable agent's tendency to choose a more difficult task, whereas a highly capable agent's pattern of choices is unaffected by <b>performance</b> <b>rewards.</b> Although the productivity of agents in our experiment therefore decreased if they had to convince a principal of their capability, we show that these detrimental performance implications can to some degree be overcome for less capable agents through <b>performance</b> <b>rewards</b> or by ensuring that the principal can interpret the agent's choice.

40|$|This study {{examines}} three main variables, Machiavellianism, locus of control, and <b>performance</b> to <b>reward</b> expectancies, and {{the relationships among}} them. The sample group consisted of 26 managers, supervisors or administrators and 21 nonmanagerial exployees of an 83 bed hospital. These participants were given a questionnaire consisting of the Mach V scale, Rotter's I-E scale, and a <b>performance</b> to <b>reward</b> expectancy scale. The hypothesis of this study states that individual's with high Mach scores will have low <b>performance</b> to <b>reward</b> expectancies and will be externally controlled. Individuals with low Mach scores will then have high <b>performance</b> to <b>reward</b> expectancies and will be interrially controlled. Managers were expected to have lower Mach scores and be more internally controlled as well as having higher <b>performance</b> to <b>reward</b> expectancies {{in comparison to the}} nonmanagerial exployees. The results of this study showed no correlations between Mach scores and the other variables. Expectancy theory correlation to locus of control was observed in this study. Managers were seen to-have stronger <b>performance</b> to <b>reward</b> expectancies'and were more internally motivated than nonmanagers. However, {{there was no significant difference}} between these groups in regards to Mach scores. Problems with the study include small sample size and small variation among Mach scores.

One of the challenges of knowledge management is that of getting people to share their knowledge (Skyrme, 200 2). Traditional incentives such as bonuses are not always enough to change behaviour of employees toward sharing knowledge (Stevens, 2000). Career advancement and performance appraisal seem to be creating a mentality of fear that deter employees from sharing knowledge in organisations (Chaudhry, 2005).

Our models of the determinants of training confirm previous research: age, education, contract, tenure, and firm size all influence training. Several components of HPWP are associated with a higher probability of training, specifically, general (non-firm-specific) training. Participation in general training is associated with higher earnings, as is involvement in highly participative and consultative working arrangements, and <b>performance</b> <b>reward</b> systems. These patterns of training, and returns to training, are broadly consistent with HPWP approaches and represent a challenge to human capital theory. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{multiuser}} independent Q-learning method {{which does}} not need information interaction is proposed for multiuser dynamic spectrum accessing in cognitive radios. The method adopts self-learning paradigm, in which each CR user performs reinforcement learning only through observing individual <b>performance</b> <b>reward</b> without spending communication resource on information interaction with others. The reward is defined suitably to present channel quality and channel conflict status. The learning strategy of sufficient exploration, preference for good channel, and punishment for channel conflict is designed to implement multiuser dynamic spectrum accessing. In two users two channels scenario, a fast learning algorithm is proposed and the convergence to maximal whole reward is proved. The simulation results show that, with the proposed method, the CR system can obtain convergence of Nash equilibrium with large probability and achieve great performance of whole reward. ...|$|E

The investigation uses {{the following three}} constructs: The Institutional Framework and its formal and informal implications for incentive compensation, Diminishing Marginal Utility of individuals related to performance rewards, and Incentive Schemes as motivational devices in organizations. Our empirical investigation is based upon survey data collected from employees of a MNC in Germany and the USA using an enriched form of Hofstede's cross-cultural questionnaire. Our results show that employees from these countries have different preferences on incentives and further that incentive plans designed for one country might have non-motivating consequences in the other. We also find that the logic of diminishing marginal utility applies to certain rewards. Referencing these results, we suggest a method for organizations to develop effective and efficient incentive systems...|$|E

Surprisingly, non-human primates tested in ecologically, highly valid quantity discrimination tasks using edible items often show a relatively low performance, suggesting that stimulus salience interferes with rational decision making. Here we show that quantity discrimination was indeed significantly enhanced when monkeys were tested with inedible items compared with food items (84 versus 69 % correct). More importantly, when monkeys were tested with food, but rewarded with other food items, the accuracy was equally high (86 %). The {{results indicate that the}} internal representation of the stimuli, not their physical quality, determined <b>performance.</b> <b>Reward</b> replacement apparently facilitated representation of the food items as signifiers for other foods, which in turn supported a higher acuity in decision making...|$|E
