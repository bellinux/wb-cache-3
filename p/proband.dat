Apparently unrelated congenital anomalies occurred more frequently among <b>probands</b> with craniorachischisis (62 %), encephalocele (30 %), or multiple NTDs (25 %) than among <b>probands</b> with anencephaly (14. 7 %) or spina bifida (10. 1 %) (P much less than. 0001). Unrelated congenital anomalies occurred less often among <b>probands</b> with low spina bifida (6. 7 %) than among <b>probands</b> with high spina bifida (19. 5 %).

40|$|Background and Aims: The {{effect of}} the <b>proband's</b> gender on the {{familial}} aggregation of psychiatric disorders has rarely been investigated. Consequently, {{the goals of the}} study were to assess the {{effect of the}} <b>proband's</b> gender on the familial aggregation of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar-I Disorder (BP-I). Methods: The present paper was based on data from a family study of 130 bipolar-I <b>probands,</b> 158 unipolar depressive <b>probands</b> and 97 normal controls as well as their adult first-degree relatives (n= 1651). Diagnoses were made according to a best-estimate procedure based on a semi-structured interview (DIGS), medical records and family history information. Analyses were performed using logistic regression models. Results: The major findings were that the relatives of female <b>probands</b> with MDD had an almost doubled risk of suffering from recurrent MDD as compared to the those of male <b>probands</b> with MDD. Moreover, the relatives of female <b>probands</b> suffered from anxiety disorders and committed suicidal attempts more frequently than those of male <b>probands.</b> In contrast, the <b>proband's</b> gender was found to have no impact on the familial transmission of bipolar disorder. However, there was a two-times increased risk for alcohol dependence in the relatives of female as compared to male bipolar <b>probands.</b> Conclusions: Our data provided support for the influence of the <b>proband's</b> gender on the familial aggregation of MDD, suggesting higher genetic loading in depressed females as compared to males. A similar effect of the <b>proband's</b> gender could not be observed for bipolar disorder...|$|R

Methods: The study included 34 <b>probands</b> with remitted schizophrenia and 34 <b>probands</b> with euthymic {{bipolar disorder}} who had a history of psychotic symptoms that met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4 th edition (DSM-IV) criteria, unaffected first-degree relatives of <b>probands</b> (31 relatives of <b>probands</b> with schizophrenia and 29 relatives of <b>probands</b> with bipolar disorder), and 34 healthy controls.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at documenting {{different}} aspects of the expression of the disease based on clinical data from a large number of Indian <b>probands</b> with Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Information with regards to the type and frequency of seizures, precipitating factors, EEG data, response to anti-epileptic drugs and family history was collected from 329 JME <b>probands</b> seen in a large tertiary care super-speciality hospital using a uniform protocol. Detailed family pedigrees were constructed to include all the first- and second-degree relatives of <b>probands</b> and information on the seizures/epileptic syndromes in relatives was classified in a uniform way. The clinical expression and EEG features in 329 Indian <b>probands</b> were similar to the data reported on JME <b>probands</b> belonging to different population groups. Most patients (81 &#x 0025;) were treated with only valproate. Family history of seizures among first or second-degree relatives was noted in 114 of 329 (35 &#x 0025;) <b>probands.</b> the first-degree relatives had a greater chance of being affected and more often expressed a type of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) as compared to second-degree relatives of <b>probands.</b> It is concluded that the Indian <b>probands</b> express JME {{in the same manner as}} that reported in <b>probands</b> of different ethnic backgrounds.

Recurrent depressive episodes during childhood may be particularly problematic, if additional episodes have a scarring effect that hinders healthy development. Distinguishing between first onsets and recurrences has been useful in understanding adult depression. This distinction has seldom been examined in pediatric depression, {{in part because it}} is difficult to enroll adequate samples of children with recurrent depression. We conducted archival analyses of carefully-diagnosed pediatric <b>probands</b> with depression first onset between ages of 4 and 12. <b>Probands</b> who reported one depressive episode (N = 435) were compared with <b>probands</b> who reported two depression episodes (N = 115) on clinical (treatment, comorbidities), psychosocial (negative life events (NLEs), parental psychopathology) and emotion regulation measures. Based on previous findings in older adolescents and adults, we hypothesized that <b>probands</b> with two MDEs will have higher comorbidity, parental psychopathology, more NLEs, and higher maladaptive emotion regulation scale scores than <b>probands</b> with one MDE. Surprisingly, <b>probands</b> with one and two MDEs were indistinguishable on psychological and pharmacological treatment variables. As expected, <b>probands</b> with two MDEs had lower age of first onset, higher maladaptive emotion regulation scores, higher rates of comorbid anxiety and reported more NLEs than <b>probands</b> with one MDE. <b>Probands</b> with two MDEs also spent a longer total time in episode; group differences remained after controlling for time spent depressed.

METHODS: Familial aggregation was evaluated by estimating relative risk (RR) of migraine in 143 first-degree relatives of 50 <b>probands</b> with MA, in 196 first-degree relatives of 94 <b>probands</b> with MO and also in <b>proband's</b> spouses. <b>Probands</b> were enrolled in the study from a clinical sample and a population sample was used as reference. RESULTS: A significantly increased risk of migraine was found in both first-degree relatives of MO <b>probands</b> (RR = 3. 7; 95 % CI: 3. 2 - 4. 3) and of MA <b>probands</b> (RR = 3. 6; 95 % CI: 3. 1 - 4. 3), comparatively to the general population.
