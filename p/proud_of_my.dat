[...] Richard's casting was considered to be [...] "a giant leap of faith" [...] by co-creators Holland and Smith, but one that ultimately [...] "landed on its feet", because Pauline went on to be one of the longest running characters in EastEnders history, remaining with the show for nearly twenty-two years.|$|E
