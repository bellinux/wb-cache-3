40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} whether <b>pet</b> <b>dogs</b> owned by patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at a higher risk of developing SLE. Diagnosis of canine SLE was mainly based on the 11 diagnostic criteria for human SLE and two marked immunological features of canine SLE. Among 59 <b>pet</b> <b>dogs</b> owned by 37 SLE patients, 11 (18. 64 %) were ANA positive, and three (5. 08 %) had SLE. In contrast, of 187 <b>pet</b> <b>dogs</b> owned by non-SLE households, nine (4. 81 %) were ANA positive, and none (0 %) had SLE. Among 650 outpatient dogs registered in the veterinary hospital, 34 (5. 23 %) were ANA positive, and six (0. 92 %) had SLE. Frequency of ANA and SLE among <b>pet</b> <b>dogs</b> owned by SLE patients was significantly higher than in <b>pet</b> <b>dogs</b> owned by non-SLE households (P = 0. 001 for ANA; P = 0. 013 for SLE) and in outpatient dogs (P, 0. 001 for ANA; P = 0. 032 for SLE). With respect to canine SLE development, the relative risk or risk ratio (R) of human SLE contact varied from 5. 5 (compared with outpatient dogs) to near the infinite (compared with dogs owned by non-SLE households). The prevalence of canine SLE among <b>pet</b> <b>dogs</b> of SLE patients was therefore estimated to be 508 per 10 000 [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 0 - 1068]. In conclusion, <b>pet</b> <b>dogs</b> with human SLE contact were at a higher risk of developing SLE.

40|$|Background: In recent years, {{surveys of}} Toxoplasma gondii {{infection}} in dogs {{have been reported}} worldwide, including China. However, {{little is known about}} the prevalence of T. gondii in <b>pet</b> <b>dogs</b> in Northwest China. In the present study, the prevalence of T. gondii in <b>pet</b> <b>dogs</b> in Lanzhou, China was investigated using the modified agglutination test (MAT). Results: In this survey, antibodies to T. gondii were found in 28 of 259 (10. 81 %) <b>pet</b> <b>dogs,</b> with MAT titers of 1 : 20 in 14 dogs, 1 : 40 in nine, 1 : 80 in four, and 1 : 160 or higher in one dog. The prevalence ranged from 6. 67 % to 16. 67 % among dogs of different ages, with low rates in young <b>pet</b> <b>dogs,</b> and high rates in older <b>pet</b> <b>dogs.</b> The seroprevalence in dogs> 3 years old was higher than that in dogs ≤ 1 years old, but the difference was not statistically significant (P> 0. 05).

However, she is not affiliated with Gaia or Guardian, and instead follows in the path of an ancient sect of summoners called Druids who revered nature and protected Kagari with familiars. Another heroine is first-year student Sizuru Nakatsu, a shy girl on the public morals committee who has excellent hearing, eyesight and can read lips. She has heterochromia, though wears an eyepatch over her golden-colored right eye as she is very self-conscious about it; her left eye is blue. Sizuru is a member of Guardian who has the ability to produce various chemicals inside her body which can be used to heal herself and others, paralyze and cause amnesia. Sizuru joins the club with her close friend Lucia Konohana, another heroine and the class representative of Kotarou's class. Lucia is easily agitated by the antics of boys and often punches Kotarou when he annoys her. She is obsessed with cleanliness and always wears gloves.

Among these genera, Aspergillus (25 %), Cladosporium (23 %) and Penicillium (20. 5 %) were 3 major genera. 63 % of the 44 isolates showed color changes on dermatophyte test medium (DTM).

Canine piroplasmosis {{has been reported to}} be prevalent in China. However, no molecular evidence of the disease has been reported in <b>pet</b> <b>dogs</b> from Wuhan. In this study, 118 blood samples were randomly collected from <b>pet</b> <b>dogs</b> in veterinary clinics.

30|$|Cancer {{researchers}} {{have a unique}} opportunity to include naturally occurring cancers in <b>pet</b> <b>dogs</b> as translational models in the development path of new human cancer drugs, to the ultimate benefit to both species. Naturally occurring cancers in <b>pet</b> <b>dogs</b> and humans share many features, including histological appearance, tumor genetics, molecular targets, biological behavior, and response to both conventional and novel targeted cancer therapies. Formal integration of studies including <b>pet</b> <b>dogs</b> with cancer is becoming a more common component of an innovative cancer drug development process. Because no gold standard treatments exist for pet animals with cancer, new treatments can be provided to <b>pet</b> <b>dogs</b> with cancer at earlier stages of progression than human trials. Flexibility in the conduct and design of such trials permits serial collection of biologic samples and imaging endpoints during exposure to novel cancer agents. Lastly, cancer progresses at a faster rate in <b>pet</b> <b>dogs</b> than in humans; accordingly, these studies can be completed without interrupting the existing development path. The intramural NCI’s Center for Cancer Research established the comparative oncology program (COP) to develop this novel cancer drug development opportunity, address potential risks with this approach, and establish the organizational infrastructure to undertake translational clinical trials in <b>pet</b> <b>dogs.</b> This clinical trial infrastructure unites study sponsors with 22 academic veterinary centers to support multicenter clinical trials of investigational therapeutics.
