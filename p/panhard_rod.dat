25|$|The chassis was a widened and {{reinforced}} Healey Silverstone box-section ladder-type steel frame. Independent front suspension, also Healey Silverstone, was by coil springs, trailing link, and a sway bar. The rear suspension featured Nash's rear end and coil springs replaced the Silverstone’s leaf springs, while the beam axle was located by <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Girling-manufactured brakes used [...] discs at {{the front}} and [...] drums at the rear. The {{suspension}} was independent {{at the front}}, using coil springs, and at the rear had a live axle and semi-elliptic springs. Apart from {{the addition of a}} <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod</b> to better locate the rear axle, and stiffer front springs to cope with the weight of the V8 engine, the Tiger's suspension and braking systems are identical to that of the standard Alpine. The fitting points for the <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod</b> interfered with the upright spare wheel in the boot, which was repositioned to lie horizontally beneath a false floor; the battery was moved from beneath the rear seat to the boot at the same time. The kerb weight of the car increased from the [...] of the standard Alpine to [...]|$|E
2500|$|The Mustang has a MacPherson-strut front {{suspension}} with reverse [...] "L" [...] {{lower control}} arms. The rear suspension {{was a new}} three-link system with a <b>Panhard</b> <b>Rod</b> that controls the vertical and lateral movements of the axle. This live axle rear suspension, while sacrificing handling, provides the benefits of reduced cost and weight over heavier, more expensive independent rear suspensions. In spite of this, Ford has drawn heavy criticism from the automotive journalism community for the decision to equip the 5th generation Mustang with the live axle system. At a press conference, Ford stated that to include an independent rear suspension would have added $5,000 to the showroom price of the car.|$|E
50|$|In a way, Watt’s linkage {{can be seen}} as two <b>Panhard</b> <b>rods</b> mounted {{opposite}} each other. In Watt’s arrangement, {{however, the}} opposing curved movements introduced by the pivoting <b>Panhard</b> <b>rods</b> largely balance each other in the short vertical rotating bar.|$|R
40|$|Optimization of {{cast iron}} safety {{components}} of commercial vehicles by material selection and geometry under consideration of service loadings. The structural durability of safety components in chassis comprise not only the fatigue behaviour under cyclic variable amplitude service loading, but also its interaction between prestrains caused by special events and the rupture behaviour under impact loading due to misuse. From this background the structural durability behaviour of <b>Panhard</b> <b>rods</b> of ferritic cast nodular iron EN-GJS- 400 - 15 was compared with the behaviour of rods of the austempered EN-GJS- 800 - 8 (ADI). Investigated components, <b>Panhard</b> <b>rods</b> and cast plugs, of the austempered material reveal a higher impact resistance than {{the components of the}} ferritic cast nodular iron. Due to its ausferrite microstructure <b>Panhard</b> <b>rods</b> of EN-GJS- 800 - 8 display a significantly superior fatigue strength behaviour especially under spectrum loading and bear a lightweight design potential in comparison to the conventional EN-GJS- 400 - 15. Prestrains do not affect the fatigue behaviour under variable amplitude loading and the plastic deformation of the component under impact loading can be increased by appropriate design reducing the stiffness in the shaft area. The appertaining design modification enables also a weight reduction by 15 %. Hence, the austempered variant of the <b>Panhard</b> <b>rods</b> is not produced because of the higher manufacturing costs resulting from the lower number of items. But the expertize gained enabled the cost saving development of a four-point link (x-link) ...|$|R
25|$|A-arm {{suspension}} (short upper arm, long lower arm) with coils {{was used}} at the front and swing axle suspension with semi-trailing arms, <b>Panhard</b> <b>rods</b> and a transverse semi-elliptical leaf spring was {{used at the}} rear.|$|R
2500|$|Although the Chevette was {{essentially}} a rebranded Opel Kadett C with revised front-end (detailed below), it used the 1,256cc overhead valve (OHV) engine from the Viva HC instead of the Kadett's 1,196 cc engines, which were produced by Opel. The Kadett's double wishbone front suspension, rear-wheel drive and rear suspension with <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod,</b> torque tube and coil sprung live axle were carried over unaltered. Inside, the two cars differed {{only in terms of}} their dashboard and switchgear: the Chevette stuck to the British and Japanese right-hand drive tradition of having the indicator switch on the right-hand side of the steering column, while the Kadett had the mainland European left-hand drive custom of the flasher stalk being on the left. [...] The Chevette also had a much more angular instrument binnacle, although the instruments themselves were from the Kadett (though with imperial rather than metric scales).|$|E
2500|$|The Lagonda {{company was}} founded in 1906 in Staines, Surrey, by a Scottish-American, Wilbur Gunn (1859–1920), a former opera singer. He became a British {{national}} in 1891 {{and worked as a}} speed boat and motorcycle engineer in Staines, England. He named the company after the Shawnee settlement [...] "Lagonda" [...] in modern-day Springfield, Ohio, the town of his birth. This is a glacially eroded limestone gorge of much beauty. Historically, the area {{played a major role in}} the Treaty of Easton and the aligning of the Shawnee tribe with the British during the French and Indian War. He had originally built motorcycles on a small scale in the garden of his house in Staines with reasonable success including a win on the 1905 London–Edinburgh trial. In 1907 he launched his first car, the 20hp, 6-cylinder Torpedo, which he used to win the Moscow–St. Petersburg trial of 1910. This success produced a healthy order for exports to Russia which continued until 1914. In 1913 Lagonda introduced an advanced small car, the 11.1 with a four-cylinder 1099 cc engine, which by 1914 featured a <b>panhard</b> <b>rod</b> and a rivetted unibody body and the first ever fly-off handbrake.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of the <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod</b> is its simplicity. Its major disadvantage is that the axle must necessarily move in an arc relative to the body, with the radius equal {{to the length of}} the <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod.</b> If the rod is too short, it allows excessive sideways movement between the axle and the body at the ends of the spring travel. Therefore, the <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod</b> is less desirable on smaller cars than larger ones. A suspension design that is similar but dramatically reduces the sideways component of the axle's vertical travel is Watt's linkage.|$|E
50|$|More {{unconventional}} {{was the use}} of a backbone chassis and four-wheel independent suspension.A-arm suspension (short upper arm, long lower arm) with coils {{was used}} at the front and swing axle suspension with semi-trailing arms, <b>Panhard</b> <b>rods</b> and a transverse semi-elliptical leaf spring was used at the rear.|$|R
5000|$|The Unimog 401 is a {{very compact}} vehicle with an {{approximate}} length of just 3.5 metres. It has an U-shaped ladder frame, rigid portal axles both in the rear and front with four wheels of the same size. Each axle has additional reduction gears for each wheel built in. Both front and rear axle are supported by a central joint and <b>panhard</b> <b>rods.</b> The 401 has coil springs and hydraulic shock absorbers. Daimler-Benz used 6.5-20" [...] multi-purpose tyres for the Unimog, that are made for both on- and off-road applications. The brake system is hydraulic, the 401 has drum brakes for each wheel. While the 401 has a wheelbase of 1720 mm, the 402 has 2120 mm wheelbase.|$|R
50|$|The Noble uses a unibody frame {{based on}} a {{shortened}} Suzuki Alto platform. It carries the same MacPherson strut independent front suspension and a dead axle rear suspension with a <b>Panhard</b> stabilizing <b>rod.</b> The body is constructed using high tensile and ultra high tensile steel, a choice that makes the car somewhat heavy for its size at 875 kg.|$|R
50|$|A live axle, {{retained}} by a <b>panhard</b> <b>rod</b> was employed {{with an open}} differential.|$|E
5000|$|Suspension: Coil springs with {{hydraulic}} shock absorbers front and solid axle with <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod</b> at rear.|$|E
5000|$|Suspension was {{independent}} {{up front}} byway of a [...] leaf spring, while the rear suspension was coil springs with <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E
50|$|Watt's linkage {{is used in}} {{the rear}} axle of some car {{suspensions}} as an improvement over the <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod,</b> which was designed in the early twentieth century. Both methods intend to prevent relative sideways motion between the axle and body of the car. Watt’s linkage approximates a vertical straight line motion more closely, and does so while locating the centre of the axle rather than toward one side of the vehicle, as more commonly used when fitting a long <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E
50|$|The front {{suspension}} on most machines uses four links, a <b>panhard</b> <b>rod</b> and anti-roll bar. On the 4000 series a V-link is {{used at the}} front.|$|E
50|$|The linkage {{does not}} share the {{disadvantages}} of the asymmetric <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod</b> and although more compact than Watt's linkage has all the forces in one link.|$|E
50|$|Panhards won {{numerous}} races from 1895 to 1903. Panhard et Levassor {{developed the}} <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod,</b> {{which came to}} be used in many other types of automobiles as well.|$|E
50|$|The Audi 80 had a MacPherson strut front suspension, and a C-section beam {{rear axle}} located by {{trailing}} arms and a <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod,</b> and using coil springs and telescopic dampers.|$|E
50|$|The torque-tube {{rear axle}} of the A series was {{replaced}} by a four-link rear axle with a <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod</b> in mid-'68, and remained the same throughout B and C models.|$|E
50|$|Some {{vehicles}} with live-axle suspensions, where Watt's linkage {{is not an}} option, e.g. a number of Land Rover models use a <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod</b> {{as a component of}} the front suspension.|$|E
50|$|The front suspension, as {{with its}} predecessors, {{is of the}} double {{wishbone}} type with coil springs and an anti-roll bar while the rear suspension uses a solid axle with coil springs and a <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} system uses Land Rover Discovery beam axles front and rear. The front axles are located by radius rods and a <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod.</b> The rear axle is located by trailing arms and Watt's linkage.|$|E
5000|$|Ala Kart began {{life as a}} '29 Ford Model A pickup. The chassis {{work was}} done by long-time friends Peters and [...] "Blackie" [...] Gejeian at their Fresno, California shop, with the body and styling by Barris (at Barris Kustoms in Los Angeles). The frame had a new centrally-located crossmember, and was {{completely}} chromed. The front end was also chromed, including a 4 in dropped axle, coil springs (not the factory leaf springs), split wishbones, <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod,</b> and tube shocks. 1940 Ford drum brakes were used. In back, a 1932 Ford rear axle was fitted, along with specially-fabricated coil springs, <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod,</b> all chromed, and Ford drum brakes. All four corners were equipped with Cadillic airbag suspension pieces.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod</b> (also called Panhard bar or track bar) is a {{suspension}} link that provides lateral {{location of the}} axle. Originally invented by the Panhard automobile company of France {{in the early twentieth}} century, this device has been widely used ever since.|$|E
50|$|The {{platform}} basics are a MacPherson {{strut suspension}} {{in front and}} 3-link solid axle in the rear with a <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod.</b> Unlike previous Special Vehicle Team (SVT) Mustang variations, the Shelby GT500 does not include independent rear suspension, but instead has a solid rear axle.|$|E
5000|$|In contrast, the Hotchkiss drive has the {{traction}} forces {{transmitted to}} the car frame by using other suspension components such as leaf springs or trailing arms. A ball and socket type of joint called a [...] "torque ball" [...] is used {{at one end of}} the torque tube to allow relative motion between the axle and transmission due to suspension travel. Later AMC/Rambler models (1962 through 1966) used a flange and cushion mount in place of the ball and socket. Since the torque tube does not constrain the axle in the lateral (side-to-side) direction a <b>panhard</b> <b>rod</b> is often used for this purpose. The combination of the <b>panhard</b> <b>rod</b> and the torque tube allows the easy implementation of soft coil springs in the rear to give good ride quality [...]|$|E
50|$|Suspension is {{conventional}} by unequal length wishbones and coil over damper at {{the front}} and by coil sprung live rear axle at the rear which is located by a transverse link (<b>Panhard</b> <b>rod)</b> and two pairs of forward extending radius rods to react braking and acceleration and to control axle wind-up.|$|E
50|$|The chassis was a widened and {{reinforced}} Healey Silverstone box-section ladder-type steel frame. Independent front suspension, also Healey Silverstone, was by coil springs, trailing link, and a sway bar. The rear suspension featured Nash's rear end and coil springs replaced the Silverstone’s leaf springs, while the beam axle was located by <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Girling-manufactured brakes used 9.85 in discs at {{the front}} and 9 in drums at the rear.

50|$|The front {{suspension}} initially had outboard {{springs and}} shock absorbers, but with later versions, this was moved inboard with a rocker arm upper suspension arm. There were {{two types of}} rear suspension offered: one with a live axle, located by trailing arms, leading arms and a <b>panhard</b> <b>rod.</b> The other had independent rear suspension.|$|E
50|$|A beam axle's {{fore and}} aft {{location}} is constrained by either: trailing arms, semi-trailing arms, radius rods, or leaf springs. The lateral location is constrained by either: a <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod,</b> a Scott Russell linkage or a Watt's linkage. While shock absorbers and either leaf springs, coil springs, or air bags are used to control vertical movement.|$|E
50|$|All models {{featured}} MacPherson strut {{independent front suspension}} {{as well as a}} four-link {{trailing arm}} rear suspension arrangement with a <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod.</b> Disc brakes were fitted as standard equipment on the front of all models. Rear disc brakes were fitted as standard on the 2000GT and 2000SL, which were not available to all international markets. Other models were fitted with rear drum brakes.|$|E
50|$|The rear {{suspension}} {{was of the}} De Dion type, with the unusual feature that, to restrain the tube from side-to-side movement, its tube had a small wheel at its midpoint that rolled in a vertical channel {{on the front of}} the differential (which in a De Dion system is bolted to the chassis) instead of using a Watts linkage or a <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Early {{examples}} {{continued to}} use the chain drive and independent suspension in the rear. 752 roadsters and 242 coupés were then produced. After that Honda switched to a conventional drive-shaft, live axle rear end with four radius rods and a <b>Panhard</b> <b>rod.</b> [...] 604 roadsters and 69 coupes were built with this setup before disc brakes replaced the front drums.|$|E
