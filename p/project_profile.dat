40|$|We have {{analysed}} {{the distribution}} of galaxies in groups identified in the largest redshift surveys at the present: the final release of the 2 dF Galaxy Redshift Survey and the first release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our work comprises {{the study of the}} galaxy density profiles and the fraction of galaxies per spectral type {{as a function of the}} group-centric distance. We have calculated the <b>projected</b> galaxy density <b>profiles</b> of galaxy groups using composite samples in order to increase the statistical significance of the results. Special cares have been taken in order to avoid possible biases in the group identification and the construction of the <b>projected</b> galaxy density <b>profile</b> estimator. The results show that the <b>projected</b> galaxy density <b>profiles</b> obtained for both redshift surveys are in agreement with a projected Navarro, Frenk & White predictions in the range 0. 15 < r/r_ 200 < 1, whereas a good fit for the measured profiles in the whole range of r/r_ 200 is given by a <b>projected</b> King <b>profile.</b> We have adopted a generalized King profile to fit the measured <b>projected</b> density <b>profiles</b> per spectral type. In order to infer the 3 -D galaxy density profiles, we deproject the 2 -D density profiles using a deprojection method similar to the developed by Allen & Fabian. From 2 -D and 3 -D galaxy density profiles we have estimated the corresponding galaxy fractions per spectral type. The 2 -D fraction of galaxies computed using the <b>projected</b> <b>profiles</b> show a similar segregation of galaxy spectral types as the obtained by Domínguez et al. for groups in the early data release of the 2 dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. As expected, the trends obtained for the 3 -D galaxy fractions show steeper slopes than the observed in the 2 -D fractions.

This brings together two worlds which were separated for a long time: Information Modelling (IM) and Information Retrieval (IR, or: document retrieval).
