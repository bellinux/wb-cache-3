[...] Some, such as those of the Chilean rose tarantula (Grammastola rosea) and the <b>Pinktoe</b> <b>tarantula</b> (Avicularia avicularia), are fairly mild and innocuous to humans. [...] Others, such as those of the Brazilian giant white knee tarantula (Acanthoscurria geniculata), are moderately irritating. [...] Still others, such as the Goliath Birdeater (Theraphosa blondi), are far more severe. [...] These hairs can result in painful rashes, and have been likened to sharp shards of fiberglass.|$|E

50|$|They {{are known}} to lure in their victims {{through the process of}} stationization, the act of {{remaining}} in a trance-like state until moment of attack. A full grown <b>pinktoe</b> <b>tarantula</b> can grow up to six inches in length. Their first reaction when threatened is usually to run or leap away, but they may react defensively if provoked (as with any theraphosid). Their venom is considered mild, even compared to other new-world tarantulas.|$|E
