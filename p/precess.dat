5|$|The {{role of the}} {{gyroscopic}} effect in most bike designs is to help steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean. This phenomenon is called precession and the rate at which an object precesses is inversely proportional to its rate of spin. The slower a front wheel spins, the faster it will <b>precess</b> when the bike leans, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 c is in a 1:2:4 Laplace {{resonance}} {{with the}} outer planets Gliese 876 b and Gliese 876 e: for every orbit of planet e, planet b completes two orbits and planet c completes four. This leads to strong gravitational {{interactions between the}} planets, causing the orbital elements to change rapidly as the orbits <b>precess.</b> This is the second known example of a Laplace resonance, the first being Jupiter's moons Io, Europa and Ganymede.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers such as David Morrison {{argue that}} the galactic equator is an entirely {{arbitrary}} line and can never be precisely drawn, because {{it is impossible to}} determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above , an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to. Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to <b>precess</b> its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.|$|E
5|$|If k is close, but not equal, to one, {{the second}} orbit resembles the first, but {{revolves}} gradually about {{the center of}} force; {{this is known as}} orbital precession (Figure3). If k is greater than one, the orbit <b>precesses</b> {{in the same direction as}} the orbit (Figure3); if k is less than one, the orbit <b>precesses</b> in the opposite direction.|$|R
5000|$|That is, if the gyroscope's angular momentum, {{relative}} to the fixed stars is , then it <b>precesses</b> as ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{direction}} of precession is opposite the {{direction of}} revolution. For a typical prograde orbit around Earth ( [...] i.e. in {{the direction of}} central body rotation [...] ), the longitude of the ascending node decreases, i.e., node <b>precesses</b> westward. If the orbit is retrograde, this increases the longitude of the ascending node, i.e., node <b>precesses</b> eastward. This nodal progression enables Sun-synchronous orbits to maintain approximately constant angle relative to the Sun.|$|R
5|$|Similarly, the Sun's December {{solstice}} position (in {{the northern}} hemisphere, {{the lowest point}} on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of Sagittarius, one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the Milky Way. Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from {{the surface of the}} Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to <b>precess</b> through it. In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the galactic equator. In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.|$|E
5|$|TY Coronae Borealis is a {{pulsating}} {{white dwarf}} (of ZZ Ceti) type, which is around 70% as massive as the Sun, yet has only 1.1% of its diameter. Discovered in 1990, UW Coronae Borealis is a low-mass X-ray binary system {{composed of a}} star less massive than the Sun and a neutron star surrounded by an accretion disk that draws material from the companion star. It varies in brightness in an unusually complex manner: the two stars orbit each other every 111 minutes, yet there is another cycle of 112.6 minutes, which corresponds to the orbit of the disk around the degenerate star. The beat period of 5.5 days indicates the time the accretion disk—which is asymmetrical—takes to <b>precess</b> around the star.|$|E
5|$|The bending of the Laplace {{plane of}} the Solar System toward that of Planet Nine's orbit can produce the {{apparent}} clustering of the longitude of the ascending nodes and arguments of perihelion of the extreme TNOs. The Laplace plane defines the center about which the pole of an object's orbit precesses with time. At larger semi-major axes the angular momentum of Planet Nine causes the Laplace plane to bend toward that of its orbit. As a result, when the poles of the eTNO orbit <b>precess</b> about the Laplace plane, they tend to remain {{on one side of}} the ecliptic pole. For objects with small inclination relative to Planet Nine, which were found to be more stable in simulations, this off-center precession resembles a libration of the longitudes of ascending nodes with respect to the ecliptic making them appear clustered. In combination with the anti-alignment of the longitudes of perihelion this can also produce clustering of the arguments of perihelion.|$|E
5000|$|Thus, if the {{specimen}} {{of interest is}} quite small, the maximum precession angle will be restrained. This is most significant for conditions of convergent beam illumination. 50 nm is a general lower limit on probe size for standard TEMs operating at high precession angles (>30mRad), but can be surpassed in Cs corrected instruments. [...] In principle the minimum <b>precessed</b> probe can reach approximately the full-width-half-max (FWHM) of the converged un-precessed probe in any instrument, however in practice the effective <b>precessed</b> probe is typically ~10-50x larger due to uncontrolled aberrations present at high angles of tilt. For example, a 2 nm <b>precessed</b> probe with >40 mrad precession angle was demonstrated in an aberration-corrected Nion UltraSTEM with native sub-Å probe (aberrations corrected to ~35 mrad half-angle).|$|R

5|$|The secular {{evolution}} of the objects' orbits varies with their orbits. The orbits of some objects are metastable, for example, some that are initially aligned with Planet Nine. The orbits of these objects <b>precess</b> until parts of the orbits are tangent to that of Planet Nine, leading to close encounters. Some stable orbits do exist for aligned objects with smaller eccentricities. Objects in these orbits have high perihelia and {{have yet to be}} observed, however, and an additional perturbation would have been required to be captured in these orbits. The curves followed also vary with the semi-major axis of the object, with the region where aligned orbits are possible decreasing for larger semi-major axes. Without the inclusion of resonant dynamics the secular dynamics becomes more complex for inclined objects with semi-major axes beyond 300 AU. Alignment and anti-alignment is this case is more the result of sticky chaos rather than confinement with orbits evolving widely but spending more time in regions of relative stability associated with secular resonances. Including the resonant dynamics, for example if Sedna is in a 3:2 resonance with Planet Nine as proposed by Malhotra, Volk and Wang, also alters these curves and can shift the centers of the libration islands away from anti-alignment.|$|E

25|$|A secular {{resonance}} {{occurs when}} the precession of two orbits is synchronised (usually a precession of the perihelion or ascending node). A small body in secular resonance with a much larger one (e.g. a planet) will <b>precess</b> {{at the same rate}} as the large body. Over long times (a million years, or so) a secular resonance will change the eccentricity and inclination of the small body.|$|E

25|$|Under Newtonian physics, a {{two-body}} system {{consisting of}} a lone object orbiting a spherical mass would trace out an ellipse with the spherical mass at a focus. The point of closest approach, called the periapsis (or, because the central body in the Solar System is the Sun, perihelion), is fixed. A number of effects in the Solar System cause the perihelia of planets to <b>precess</b> (rotate) around the Sun. The principal cause {{is the presence of}} other planets which perturb one another's orbit. Another (much less significant) effect is solar oblateness.|$|E
25|$|Norden's {{first attempt}} at an {{improved}} bombsight was actually an advance in PDI design. His idea was to remove the manual electrical switches used to move the pointer and use the entire bombsight itself as the indicator. He proposed attaching a low-power sighting telescope to a gyro platform that would keep the telescope pointed at the same azimuth, correcting for the aircraft's movements. The bombardier would simply rotate the telescope left or right to follow the target. This motion would cause the gyros to <b>precess,</b> and this signal would drive the PDI automatically.|$|E
25|$|Tests of the Lense–Thirring precession, {{consisting}} of small secular precessions of {{the orbit of}} a test particle in motion around a central rotating mass, for example, a planet or a star, have been performed with the LAGEOS satellites, but many aspects of them remain controversial. The same effect may have been detected in the data of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft, a former probe in orbit around Mars; also such a test raised a debate. First attempts to detect the Sun's Lense–Thirring effect on the perihelia of the inner planets have been recently reported as well. Frame dragging would cause the orbital plane of stars orbiting near a supermassive black hole to <b>precess</b> about the black hole spin axis. This effect should be detectable {{within the next few}} years via astrometric monitoring of stars at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. By comparing the rate of orbital precession of two stars on different orbits, it is possible in principle to test the no-hair theorems of general relativity.|$|E
50|$|The planet Mercury is {{especially}} susceptible to Jupiter's influence {{because of a}} small celestial coincidence: Mercury's perihelion, {{the point where it}} gets closest to the Sun, <b>precesses</b> {{at a rate of about}} 1.5 degrees every 1000 years, and Jupiter's perihelion <b>precesses</b> only a little slower. At one point, the two may fall into sync, at which time Jupiter's constant gravitational tugs could accumulate and pull Mercury off course.This could eject it from the Solar System altogether or send it on a collision course with Venus, the Sun, or Earth with 1-2% probability, 3-4 billion years into the future.|$|R

25|$|The {{experiment}} is normally conducted using electrically neutral particles or atoms. This avoids the large deflection {{in the path}} of a charged particle moving through a magnetic field and allows spin-dependent effects to dominate. For example, observation of the Stern–Gerlach effect with free electrons is infeasible. If the particle is treated as a classical spinning magnetic dipole, it will <b>precess</b> in a magnetic field because of the torque that the magnetic field exerts on the dipole (see torque-induced precession). If it moves through a homogeneous magnetic field, the forces exerted on opposite ends of the dipole cancel each other out and the trajectory of the particle is unaffected. However, if the magnetic field is inhomogeneous then the force {{on one end of the}} dipole will be slightly greater than the opposing force on the other end, so that there is a net force which deflects the particle's trajectory. If the particles were classical spinning objects, one would expect the distribution of their spin angular momentum vectors to be random and continuous. Each particle would be deflected by a different amount, producing some density distribution on the detector screen. Instead, the particles passing through the Stern–Gerlach apparatus are deflected either up or down by a specific amount. This was a measurement of the quantum observable now known as spin angular momentum, which demonstrated possible outcomes of a measurement where the observable has a discrete set of values or point spectrum. Although some discrete quantum phenomena, such as atomic spectra, were observed much earlier, the Stern–Gerlach experiment allowed scientists to observe separation between discrete quantum states for the first time in the history of science.|$|E
500|$|Without {{the secular}} {{effects of a}} distant massive planet and beyond the {{influence}} of Neptune the perihelia of eTNOs would <b>precess</b> at rates that varied with their semi-major axes and eccentricities. The directions, or the longitudes of perihelia (ϖ) would circulate, passing through all values ranging from 0° to 360°, and any initial alignment would be smeared out by their varied precession rates. The distance of their perihelia and their eccentricities, in contrast, would remain unchanged.|$|E
500|$|When {{a neutron}} {{is put into}} a {{magnetic}} field produced by an external source, it is subject to a torque tending to orient its magnetic moment parallel to the field (hence its spin antiparallel to the field). [...] Like any magnet, the amount of this torque is proportional both to the magnetic moment and the external magnetic field. [...] Since the neutron has spin angular momentum, this torque will cause the neutron to <b>precess</b> with a well-defined frequency, called the Larmor frequency. It is this phenomenon that enables the measurement of nuclear properties through nuclear magnetic resonance. The Larmor frequency can {{be determined by the}} product of the gyromagnetic ratio with the magnetic field strength. Since the sign of γn is negative, the neutron's spin angular momentum precesses counterclockwise about the direction of the external magnetic field.|$|E

The differential rotation of the outer part of a neutrino dominated accretion disc may result in precession of the inner part of the disc and the central black hole, hence drives a <b>precessed</b> jet via neutrino annihilation around the inner part of the disc.
