Therefore, the prediction of MHC-peptide binding is principal for anticipating potential T cell epitopes and is of immense relevance in vaccine design.

40|$|Abstract:- Sequence {{analysis}} {{often does}} not take the <b>physicochemical</b> <b>properties</b> into account. On the other hand, some of these properties could be useful in inferring the folding and functional attributes of the molecule when considered with the original sequence information. We evaluated here an analysis using multiple aligned sequences incorporating five <b>physicochemical</b> <b>properties.</b> In addition to site invariance information, we also consider the covariation or interdependence patterns between aligned sites using an information measure. We propose a method based on analyzing the expected mutual information between sites that is statistically significant with a confidence level. When summing the measured information along the aligned sites, we compare the pattern from the measure to the structural and active site of the molecule. In the experiments, the model enzyme molecule lysozyme is chosen. The aligned sequence data are evaluated based on the mapped <b>physicochemical</b> <b>properties</b> of the amino acid residues. Analysis between the original and the transformed sequence data incorporating the <b>physicochemical</b> <b>properties</b> are then compared, subtracted and visualized.

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate <b>physicochemical</b> <b>properties</b> and genetic variation of Indonesian rice varieties, and to formulate regression equations to analyze sets of DNA markers which could predict amylose content (AC), protein content (PC) and pasting properties of the varieties. A total of 24 Indonesian indica rice varieties were chosen based on their genetic background and agricultural characteristics. We then measured selected <b>physicochemical</b> <b>properties,</b> and genotyped the varieties using 30 DNA markers.

A linear combination of reciprocal connectivity indexes (LCRCI) showed the best mapping of the water solubility of 16 amino acids while a model based on LCRCI, along with the use of supraconnectivity indexes for the amino acids proline, serine and arginine, achieved very good modeling of the water solubility of the entire set of n = 19 natural amino acids.
