500|$|Songs {{recorded}} {{during early}} demo sessions after The Here and Now became b-sides for re-releases. During this time, the band became certain {{they wished to}} make another [...] "heavy" [...] record. Tom Searle said, [...] "some <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> we've regressed, but I think we've found our enthusiasm for playing heavy music again. I'm excited again by what I've come up with on guitar and lyrically it's much more political and less personal." [...] The band started to write socially aware lyrics during the writing phase of Daybreaker; vocalist Sam Carter {{said this was a}} result of the band touring the world and seeing things he felt were downplayed by the media.|$|E
2500|$|Hilton {{expressed}} {{that his own}} son, Mario Armando Lavandeira III, will likely be bullied as well. Hilton said, [...] "He'll probably be bullied out and about because <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> things to {{me in front of}} him when we're in public... That's even one of the reasons why, even though his name is Mario, I call him Perez Jr. I want him to have an alter ego as well so when people do say things that are hurtful about his dad or hurtful about him hopefully it won't hurt as much because they don't really know him. Those people know you as Perez Jr. but you're not Perez Jr. so it doesn't matter what they say." ...|$|E

5000|$|Asked by BBC if he {{believed}} in God, Phillips said: [...] "Personally I don't. But I believe there's a higher power, a collective energy in <b>people</b> that you <b>might</b> <b>say</b> is God." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{margin of}} error has been {{described}} as an [...] "absolute" [...] quantity, equal to a confidence interval radius for the statistic. For example, if the true value is 50 percentage points, and the statistic has a confidence interval radius of 5 percentage points, then we say the {{margin of error}} is 5 percentage points. As another example, if the true value is 50 people, and the statistic has a confidence interval radius of 5 <b>people,</b> then we <b>might</b> <b>say</b> the margin of error is 5 people.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, William," [...] says I, smiling, [...] "do {{you think}} {{that if there is}} a God above, as you have so long been telling me there is, and that we must give an account to Him,--I say, do you think, if He be a righteous Judge, He will let us escape thus with the plunder, as we may call it, of so many {{innocent}} <b>people,</b> nay, I <b>might</b> <b>say</b> nations, and not call us to an account for it before we can get to Europe, where we pretend to enjoy it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{are some}} {{occasions}} when women {{set an example}} of courage to men. I was ready to endure whatever might happen to me, when I got home. What a desperate wretch! some <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> if they could look into this diary! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{explain how}} I feel about it," [...] I answered. [...] "I {{am not sure}} that I know myself. Only you must see that if it were known that he set out from the village last night to call upon me, <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> {{unpleasant}} things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would not}} do, Zaki. I {{do not wish}} to travel as a person who could ride {{attended}} by a slave. <b>People</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> 'Who is this man? Where does he come from? How is it that no one knows a man who rides with a slave?' ...|$|E
5000|$|Tadao Satō said of Raizō’s acting, {{that whether}} in jidaigeki or in modern dramas, “whether the most miserable role {{or the most}} comedic, he acted with elegance and lent sophistication and grace to the final product.” Film critic Saburō Kawamoto said of Raizō’s acting, “even when he’s here, he’s not here,” and clarified, “even in this filthy world, {{there was a sense}} of purity about him, as though he were a glimpse into a faraway place.” “Some <b>people</b> <b>might</b> take my <b>saying</b> ‘sense of purity’ as some sort of posturing phrase, but it’s not.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The game's {{emergence}} {{coincided with}} {{the decline of the}} popularity of golf among young people, with 643 courses closing between 2006 and 2014 in the United States. The sport has financially saved many struggling golf courses, and the Professional Golfers' Association of America and World Golf Foundation have both acknowledged footgolf's contribution to helping golf courses generate more income, and noted that it may contribute to the growth of golf itself. Former PGA president Ted Bishop said in 2014 that [...] "I think it would be ludicrous to think there won't be a percentage of those <b>people</b> that <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> 'Hey, you know what? I think I'd like to try and play golf." [...] In March 2016, the LPGA golfer Paula Creamer said [...] "Anytime you can do something differently in the game of golf, it’s fun and I think we’ll probably be out there (playing footgolf) a little bit more now." ...|$|R
5000|$|After this, Hartley {{said about}} the club's relegation, quoting: [...] "Some <b>people</b> <b>might</b> want to <b>say</b> 'it's gone, forget about it' - but we can use relegation as a motivation. I think you can look back to it and {{remember}} how we felt when we were relegated. It was horrible and something I don't want to experience ever again. You can use that {{to make sure it}} doesn't happen again. It can give you that fire in your belly. That's what we have to do, not just bury it and never talk about it." [...] Ahead of the 2013-14 season, Hartley remained wearing number twenty-nine shirt until his departure to Stevenage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Harry, spare me; {{you must}} be good to me and considerate, and make {{yourself}} like a brother to me. But people will know {{you are not a}} brother, and you must remember all that for my sake. But you must not leave me or desert me. Anything that <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> would be better than that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] Cissie asked. [...] "He {{knew that}} we must be {{thinking}} about it, and why shouldn't I say it? and I am glad I did, for if I had not spoken perhaps {{he would not have}} alluded to the matter, {{and he told me that}} whatever other <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> he and his mother were quite sure that Mr. Partridge did not take the money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Calthy, this {{is truly}} like old times," [...] he said. [...] "And to finish up with Tippengray, I'll say that if Lodloe and I had not our mind so filled with our own {{businesses}} and projects, I'd get him {{to go in with}} me, and help make up a class; but if I were to do that, perhaps <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> that all I wanted was to get in with the girls." ...|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Jürg Reinhart" [...] Frisch sets out, for {{the first}} time, the [...] "identity problem" [...] which his later works would exhibit. Jurg writes in a letter {{in the second part}} of the novel: [...] "You see, if I am pushed around by fully-formed <b>people,</b> as you <b>might</b> <b>say</b> being passed from one hand to another, so that each can mold a {{different}} version of me each according to his own structures, one ends up being crumbled" [...] This idea of the misshapen image of the self is illustrated in a later episode, in which Jurg is pressured by fellow voyagers on a boat trip into assuming the role of a famous pianist.|$|R
50|$|Cricket was {{introduced}} to Trobriand by a British missionary, Reverend Gilmour, in the early 20th century, to replace violent tribal warfare with gentlemanly sportsmanship. Although Arjun Appadurai recently classified cricket as a 'hard cultural form,' resistant to structural change, cricket in Trobriand underwent a huge transformation. Not only have {{the details of the}} sport such as the number of players, balls, bats, rules, and uniforms changed, but the meanings and manner of play have changed so much that it can hardly be called as a sport any more. In fact, one gets the impression from this film that the cricket in Trobriand is in fact another form of ritualized warfare (although some <b>people</b> <b>might</b> want to <b>say</b> the same thing for World Cup!).|$|R
50|$|There {{has also}} been a move to a more Western {{approach}} to qin music. A handful of professional players prefer to look at the qin from a purely realist and scientific approach, treating the qin as a purely musical instrument, rather than a cultural phenomenon. This is due to some traditionalists treating the instrument as an 'other-worldly' object than a 'this-worldly' one. This move to a much more technical approach signifies a progression in qin study and appreciation; holding on to too much old values tends to impede the transmission of qin. An example would be composition. Although around 60-odd new compositions have been composed for the qin since the 1960s, all in all, no one plays them. The reason is that many believe these new compositions do not compare with ancient scores. But technically, these ancient scores were new at the time when they were composed. Some fear that in 100 years' time, <b>people</b> then <b>might</b> <b>say</b> that we have contributed nothing new to qin. That {{is not to say that}} the qin cannot be viewed in a traditional way, but to say that the qin is also capable of a progression into new territory. There is no reason why players cannot embrace both traditional and scientific study of the qin.|$|R
6000|$|The luncheon bell rang, {{and they}} all adjourned to the dining-room. Mr. Edmonstone came in when luncheon was nearly over, rejoicing that his letters were done, but then he looked disconsolately from the window, and pitied the weather. 'Nothing for it but billiards. <b>People</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> it was {{nonsense}} to have a billiard-table in such a house, but for his part he found there was no getting through a wet day without them. Philip must beat him as usual, and Guy might {{have one of the}} young ladies to make a fourth.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{not very}} easy, Valeria. But I {{have made a}} beginning. It's the same {{principle}} as the principle in the 'Puzzles' which we used to put together when I was a boy. Only get one central bit of it right, {{and the rest of}} the Puzzle falls into its place in a longer or a shorter time. Please don't tell anybody, my dear. <b>People</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> I was in my dotage. To think of that gibberish in my note-book having a meaning in it, after all! I only got Mr. Playmore's letter this morning; and--I am really almost ashamed to mention it--I have been trying experiments on torn letters, off and on, ever since. You won't tell upon me, will you?" ...|$|E
60|$|I climbed and hallooed. In a few minutes, {{worn out}} as I was, I {{had reached the}} path above and {{attracted}} their attention. They hurried down to where Harold lay, and, using my cage for a litter, slung on a young fir-trunk, carried him back between them across their shoulders to the village. He pleaded hard {{to be allowed to}} remain at the chalet, and Elsie joined her prayers to his; but, there, I was adamant. It was not so much what <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> that I minded, but a deeper difficulty. For if once I nursed him through this trouble, how could I or any woman in my place any longer refuse him? So I passed him ruthlessly on to Lungern (though my heart ached for it), and telegraphed at once to his nearest relative, Lady Georgina, to come up and take care of him.|$|E
60|$|Now {{that he was}} out of {{pain for}} awhile, the doctor's innate {{insensibility}} to what other <b>people</b> <b>might</b> think of him, or <b>might</b> <b>say</b> to him, resumed its customary torpor in its own strangely unconscious way. He seemed only to understand that Ovid's curiosity was in search of information about trifles. Well, there would be less trouble in giving him his information, than in investigating his motives. So Benjulia talked of his furniture.|$|R
5000|$|The {{downside}} of negative criticism is, often, that it tells {{people what they}} cannot or should not do or believe, rather than telling them what they can or should do (what possibilities or options there are). So it may be disabling, rather than enabling. <b>People</b> <b>might</b> reply to a negative criticism that [...] "this is all very well, but I cannot do anything with it", or they <b>might</b> <b>say</b> [...] "now what?!". Yet, negative criticism may be necessary at times, to prevent {{a course of action}} harmful to the people concerned. If people are afraid to state a negative criticism, the existing problem might get worse.|$|R
60|$|Never had {{we heard}} a voice like hers. Never, {{in all my life}} since, have I heard such a voice. I cannot {{describe}} it. I <b>might</b> <b>say</b> it was clear; I <b>might</b> <b>say</b> it was sweet; I <b>might</b> <b>say</b> it was vibrant and far-reaching and bell-like; all this would be true, but it would give you no real idea of the peculiar quality which made the Story Girl's voice what it was.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{now comes}} the great vain question: What does {{everybody}} say? Oh, if I could only disembody myself; fly back to London for a few hours; and listen invisibly to society talking about me. I know this is mean: but one must fill up life with some mean curiosities. So please tell me what kind of sensation I have caused. Just the usual one. I suppose. Half the people never would have thought it; {{and the other half}} knew all along what it would come to. Well, I do not care much about the world in general; but I cannot quiet my conscience on the subject of my father and George. It must be very hard on papa that, after being disappointed in my marriage and having suffered long ago from what my mother did, he should now be disgraced by his daughter. For disgraced, alas! is the word. I am afraid poor George's prospects must be spoiled by the scandal, which, I know well, must be terrible. I thought my first duty was to leave Ned free, and to free myself, at all hazards; and so I did not dwell on the feelings and interests of others as much as I perhaps ought to have done. There is one point about which I am especially anxious. It never occurred to me before I went that <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> that my going was Ned's fault, and that he had treated me badly. You must contradict this with all your might and main if you hear it even hinted at.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, my dear, for a {{compliment}} to my daughter: a sincere compliment, no doubt. It comes in very neatly and nicely," [...] Mrs. Presty acknowledged, [...] "after my son-in-law's little outbreak of temper. My poor Herbert, {{when will you}} understand that I mean no harm? I am an essentially humorous person; my wonderful spirits are always carrying me away. I do assure you, Miss Westerfield, I don't know what worry is. My troubles--deaths in the family, {{and that sort of}} thing--seem to slip off me in a most remarkable manner. Poor Mr. Norman used to attribute it to my excellent digestion. My second husband would never hear of such an explanation as that. His high ideal of women shrank from allusions to stomachs. He used to speak so nicely (quoting some poet) of the sunshine of my breast. Vague, perhaps," [...] said Mrs. Presty, modestly looking down at the ample prospect of a personal nature which presented itself below her throat, [...] "but so flattering to one's feelings. There's the luncheon bell again, I declare! I'll run on before and tell them you are coming. Some <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> they wished to be punctual. I am truth itself, and I own I don't like to be helped to the underside of the fish. Au revoir! Do you remember, Miss Westerfield, when I asked you to repeat au revoir as a specimen of your French? I didn't think much of your accent. Oh, dear me, I didn't think much of your accent!" ...|$|E
60|$|He had now {{resolved}} that Florence must {{go by the}} board. If Julia {{would still}} take him she should be his wife, and he would face Florence and all the Burtons, and his own family, and all {{the world in the}} matter of his treachery. What would he care what the world might say? His treachery to Florence was a thing completed. Now, at this moment, he felt himself to be so devoted to Julia as to make him regard his engagement to Florence as one which must, at all hazards, be renounced. He thought of his mother's sorrow, of his father's scorn--of the dismay with which Fanny would hear concerning him a tale which she would believe to be so impossible; he thought of Theodore Burton, and the deep, unquenchable anger of which that brother was capable, and of Cecilia and her outraged kindness; he thought of the infamy which would be attached to him, and resolved that he must bear it all. Even if his own heart did not move him so to act, how could he hinder himself from giving comfort and happiness to this woman who was before him? Injury, wrong, and broken-hearted wretchedness, he could not prevent; but, therefore, this part was as open to him as the other. Men would say that he had done this for Lady Ongar's money; and the indignation with which he was able to regard this false accusation--for his mind declared such accusation to be damnably false--gave him some comfort. <b>People</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> of him what they pleased. He was about to do the best within his power. Bad, alas, was the best, but it was of no avail now to think of that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm sure he's got the parcel. I'll {{tell you}} what you might do. You <b>might</b> <b>say</b> that Mr. Berkeley wired that he had left {{something}} here. He had Bertie's room, you know. You <b>might</b> <b>say</b> you wanted to look for it." ...|$|R

30|$|Whether {{devaluation}} {{is involved}} {{is a matter}} of debate. Critics of euthanasia <b>might</b> <b>say</b> the person’s life, by being shortened, has been devalued by that fact; supporters <b>might</b> <b>say</b> that euthanasia actually involves respect for a person’s autonomy and for their experience of life, which has become intolerable.|$|R
60|$|She {{sat down}} to drink her tea. Not being a crying woman, she {{suffered}} quietly. She felt that Miltoun would be coming to her. She did not know at all what she should say when he did come. He could not care for her so much as she cared for him! He was a man; men soon forget! Ah! {{but he was not}} like most men. One could not look at his eyes without feeling that he could suffer terribly! In all this her own reputation concerned her not at all. Life, and her clear way of looking at things, had rooted in her the conviction that to a woman the preciousness of her reputation was a fiction invented by men entirely for man's benefit; a second-hand fetish insidiously, inevitably set-up by men for worship, in novels, plays, and law-courts. Her instinct told her that men could not feel secure in the possession of their women unless they could believe that women set tremendous store by sexual reputation. What they wanted to believe, that they did believe! But she knew otherwise. Such great-minded women as she had met or read of had always left on her the impression that reputation for them was a matter of the spirit, having little to do with sex. From her own feelings she knew that reputation, for a simple woman, meant to stand well in the eyes of him or her whom she loved best. For worldly women--and there were so many kinds of those, besides the merely fashionable--she had always noted that its value was not intrinsic, but commercial; not a crown of dignity, but just a marketable asset. She did not dread in the least what <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> of her friendship with Miltoun; nor did she feel at all that her indissoluble marriage forbade her loving him. She had secretly felt free as soon as she had discovered that she had never really loved her husband; she had only gone on dutifully until the separation, from sheer passivity, and because it was against her nature to cause pain to anyone. The man who was still her husband was now as dead to her as if he had never been born. She could not marry again, it was true; but she could and did love. If that love was to be starved and die away, it would not be because of any moral scruples.|$|E
50|$|Juliette Drouet died in Paris on 11 May 1883 {{at the age}} of 77. Hugo’s family dissuaded {{him from}} {{attending}} Juliette’s funeral out of concern for what <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... ‘Well, some <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> I have a {{hot temper}} {{but those who}} know me {{understand}} that I try to please all sides.

60|$|We {{said little}} more that night. When we parted {{she gave me}} a quick, warning glance, as if to remind me of what she had said about the danger of interference. Her {{cautions}} would have made little difference to me could I have seen my way to benefiting Barrington Cowles by anything which I <b>might</b> <b>say.</b> But what could I <b>say?</b> I <b>might</b> <b>say</b> that her former suitors had been unfortunate. I <b>might</b> <b>say</b> that I believed her to be a cruel-hearted woman. I <b>might</b> <b>say</b> that I considered her to possess wonderful, and almost preternatural powers. What impression would any of these accusations make upon an ardent lover--a man with my friend's enthusiastic temperament? I felt that it would be useless to advance them, so I was silent.|$|R
6000|$|The less gifted {{portion of}} the educated public was greatly delighted some {{years ago by a}} work by Dr. Nordau called Degeneration, in which a great number of {{abnormal}} people were studied in a pseudo- scientific manner and shown to be abnormal beyond any possibility of dispute. Mostly the samples selected were men of exceptional artistic and literary power. The book was pretentious and inconsistent--the late Lord Tennyson was quoted, I remember, as a typically [...] "sane" [...] poet in spite of the scope afforded by his melodramatic personal appearance and his morbid passion for seclusion--but it did at least serve to show that if we cannot call a man stupid we may almost invariably call him mad with some show of reason. The public read the book for the sake of its abuse, applied the intended conclusion to every success that awakened its envy, and failed altogether to see how absolutely the definition of madness was destroyed. But if madness is indeed simply genius out of hand and genius only madness under adequate control; if imagination is a snare only to the unreasonable and a disordered mind only an excess of intellectual enterprise--and really none of these things can be positively disproved--then just as reasonable as the idea of suppressing the reproduction of madness, is the idea of breeding it! Let us take all these dull, stagnant, respectable <b>people,</b> one <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> who do nothing but conform to whatever rule is established about them and obstruct whatever change is proposed to them, whose chief quality is a sheer incapacity to imagine anything beyond their petty experiences, and let us tell them plainly, [...] "It is time a lunatic married into your family." [...] Let no one run away from this with the statement that I propose such a thing should be done, but it is, at any rate in the present state of our knowledge, as reasonable a proposal, to make as its quite frequently reiterated converse.|$|R
