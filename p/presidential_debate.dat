5|$|Underwood {{announces that}} he will not run for reelection, and advocates for America Works, which he intends to pay for by {{stripping}} entitlement programs.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{analysis}} of how competitive debate organizations have solved many of the criticisms that have been leveled at political and (specifically) <b>presidential</b> <b>debating</b> and, thus, provides models that <b>presidential</b> <b>debates</b> can be patterned after {{to improve the quality}} of the debating that is taking place in the political realm. The paper's models suggested for <b>presidential</b> <b>debates</b> are: (1) a more clearly worded debate topic; (2) a more traditional academic debate format; (3) more focus on issues and less on image; and (4) more clearly spelled out rules and judging criteria. The paper elaborates on the benefits of having <b>presidential</b> <b>debates</b> be more like academic debates.
