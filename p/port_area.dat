5|$|The {{community}} of Dartmouth {{lies on the}} east shore of Halifax Harbour, while Halifax is on the west shore. Halifax and Dartmouth had thrived during times of war; the harbour {{was one of the}} British Royal Navy's most important bases in North America, a centre for wartime trade, and a home to privateers who harried the British Empire's enemies during the American Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812. The completion of the Intercolonial Railway and its Deep Water Terminal in 1880 allowed for increased steamship trade and led to accelerated development of the <b>port</b> <b>area,</b> but Halifax faced an economic downturn after the British garrison left the city in late 1905 and early 1906.|$|E
5|$|An {{inclined}} tramway, the ramp, {{was built}} {{from the front}} of the terrace, on the axis of the gatehouse, down towards the <b>port</b> <b>area</b> of Fremantle. The ramp, constructed between 1852 and 1853, is of limestone rubble from the cut and fill activities required to create the prison site and the terrace. The ramp is an integral part of the original design of the prison complex and is of exceptional heritage significance. It is now cut at its western end by a modern road which severs the historic visual link with Fremantle. On each side of the alignment of the ramp, where it intersects with Henderson Street, are three terrace houses for the accommodation of prison warders. These were erected between 1851 and 1858 and mark the boundary of the Convict Establishment at this point. The limestone used for the early prison and its associated housing was quarried on the site.|$|E
5|$|Once the commandos {{finally got}} out of the tunnel, they both swam towards the {{broadside}} of Card which anchored near the opening of the sewer. As planned, Nao and Hung attached two bombs on the ship, with one near the bilge and one at the engine compartment, just above the water surface. After the bombs had been attached to Cards hull, Nao inspected both bombs to ensure they had been assembled properly. After that Nao stuck the battery onto a pole and connected it to the bombs with wires, then set the timer. At 1.10am, the bombs were completed and both commandos retreated back into the sewer tunnel, and climbed into their canoes {{on the other side and}} rowed back to Thu Thiem. Again, the police patrol boat was waiting for Nao and Hung to arrive, because the commander wanted another bribe. As Nao and Hung approached the patrol boat, an explosion was heard and a bright light could be seen in the commercial <b>port</b> <b>area.</b> The South Vietnamese police patrol boat than started its engine and raced towards Card, instead of extracting another bribe.|$|E

5|$|Stories for {{the show}} were often co-written by Burns, who also became a {{producer}} in the show's fourth season. Other writers include three acclaimed crime fiction writers from outside of Baltimore: George Pelecanos from Washington, Richard Price from the Bronx and Dennis Lehane from Boston. Reviewers drew comparisons between Price's works (particularly Clockers) and The Wire even before he joined. In addition to writing, Pelecanos served as a producer for the third season. Pelecanos has commented that he was attracted to the project because {{of the opportunity to}} work with Simon. Staff writer Rafael Alvarez penned several episodes' scripts, as well as the series guidebook The Wire: Truth Be Told. Alvarez is a colleague of Simon's from The Baltimore Sun and a Baltimore native with working experience in the <b>port</b> <b>area.</b> Another city native and independent filmmaker, Joy Lusco, also wrote {{for the show}} in each of its first three seasons. Baltimore Sun writer and political journalist William F. Zorzi joined the writing staff in the third season and brought a wealth of experience to the show's examination of Baltimore politics.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} {{decided to}} head for Odessa flying a red flag and arrived there later that day at 22:00. A general strike had been called {{in the city and}} there was some rioting as the police tried to quell the strikers. The following day the mutineers refused to land armed sailors to help the striking revolutionaries take over the city, preferring instead to await the arrival of the other battleships of the Black Sea Fleet. Later that day the mutineers aboard the Potemkin captured a military transport, Vekha, that had arrived in the city. The riots continued as much of the <b>port</b> <b>area</b> was destroyed by fire. On the afternoon of 29 June, Vakulinchuk's funeral turned into a political demonstration and the army attempted to ambush the sailors who participated in the funeral. In retaliation, the ship fired two six-inch shells at the theatre where a high-level military meeting was scheduled to take place, but missed.|$|E
5|$|XXBomber Command's {{attacks on}} Singapore {{produced}} mixed results. The raids on Singapore Naval Base {{damaged or destroyed}} many workshops and denied the Japanese {{the use of the}} King GeorgeVI Graving Dock between late 1944 and early 1945, and the AdmiraltyIX Dry Dock from February 1945. In addition, workers at the Naval Base did not return to work for some time after each raid, and had to be provided with better pay and rations and additional air-raid shelters. Although the damage inflicted on the Empire Docks area impeded Japanese port operations, the poor condition of the <b>port</b> <b>area</b> also hindered British efforts to rehabilitate Singapore following the war. The attacks on the oil storage tanks on islands near Singapore were less successful, and many were found to still be operable after the Japanese surrender.|$|E

5|$|An army {{commanded}} by Caxias crossed into Uruguay in September 1851. The allies decided to divide their forces into two armies: a multinational force {{that included a}} single Brazilian division, and a second army composed entirely of Brazilians under Caxias. Against the wishes of Honório Hermeto, Caxias chose Manuel Marques de Sousa (later Count of Porto Alegre) to lead the former force. Caxias met and befriended Marques de Sousa, who had served under his command in the War of the Ragamuffins, during his trip to Rio Grande do Sul in 1839. The Brazilian division, led by Marques de Sousa, along with Uruguayan and Argentine rebel troops, invaded Argentina. On 3 February 1852, in the Battle of Caseros, the allies defeated an army led by Rosas, who fled to the United Kingdom, thus ending the war. Caxias spent 17 January aboard the frigate Dom Afonso alongside John Pascoe Grenfell, taking stock of the <b>port</b> <b>area</b> of Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, selecting {{the best place to}} launch an amphibious attack. His plan was aborted once the news of the victory at Caseros arrived.
