The game was co-developed by Nintendo and the American visual technology group Paradigm Simulation. It {{was one of three}} launch titles for the Nintendo 64 in Japan as well as Europe and one of two launch titles in North America. Pilotwings 64 is a follow-up to Pilotwings for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), which was a North American launch game for its respective console in 1991. Also like that game, Pilotwings 64 received <b>production</b> <b>input</b> from Nintendo producer Shigeru Miyamoto.|$|E

2500|$|Clarkson's third studio album, My December, was {{released}} on June 22, 2007. The album relied on darker themes and features a heavier rock sound. Clarkson replaced Davis as the executive producer and co-wrote all the tracks. She opted to collaborate with her band members rather than her previous producers and collaborators. Its production and release became a subject of a dispute with RCA, particularly with Davis. He noted the album's lack of professional <b>production</b> <b>input</b> and wanted her to re-record tracks with a more mainstream appeal, which she refused. Clarkson defended, [...] "I've sold more than 15 million records worldwide, and still nobody listens to what I have to say. I couldn't give a crap about being a star. I've always just wanted to sing and write." [...] The album received positive response, but lack of promotion due to reluctance of RCA led Clarkson to dismiss Kwatinetz and Live Nation to cancel its accompanying tour, the My December Tour, and reschedule it into a smaller scale with supporting acts Jon McLaughlin, Sean Kingston and Mandy Moore. Clarkson later hired the services of talent manager Narvel Blackstock of Starstruck Management. Blackstock was the husband of country artist Reba McEntire, of whom Clarkson is a close friend. Clarkson later issued an apology to Davis, citing him as [...] "a key advisor" [...] in her success.|$|E

40|$|Concern for the {{potentially}} harmful {{side effects of}} agricultural chemical inputs, especially pesticides, highlights the need to accurately determine the economic levels of their use. We consider three model specification issues: interaction of direct <b>production</b> <b>inputs</b> with damage control inputs in damage abatement, justification for a priori exclusion of <b>production</b> <b>inputs</b> from the abatement function, and the motivations and consequences of alternative stochastic specifications. Empirical analysis using farm-level data shows that misspecification of the stochastic element in the production function can overestimate the marginal physical productivity of pesticides and grossly underestimate the responsiveness of demand to increases in pesticide prices.

40|$|An {{economic}} {{analysis was conducted}} involving wheat and grain sorghum production systems that affect carbon dioxide emissions and sequester soil carbon. Parameters examined were expected net returns, changes in net carbon sequestered {{and the value of}} carbon credits necessary to equate net returns from systems that sequester more carbon to those that sequester less with and without adjustments for CO 2 emissions from <b>production</b> <b>inputs.</b> Evaluations were based on experiment station cropping practices, yield, and soil carbon data for continuously cropped and rotated wheat and grain sorghum produced with conventional and no-tillage. No-till had lower net returns because of lower yields and higher overall costs. Both crops produced under no-till had higher annual soil C gains than under conventional tillage. However, no-till systems had higher total atmospheric emissions of C from <b>production</b> <b>inputs.</b> The differences were relatively small. The C values estimated in this study that would equate net returns of no-tillage to conventional tillage range from $ 7. 82 to $ 58. 69 /ton/yr when C emissions from <b>production</b> <b>inputs</b> were subtracted from soil carbon sequestered and $ 7. 79 to $ 54. 99 /ton/yr when atmospheric emissions were not considered.

40|$|The {{modelling}} {{of production}} in microeconomics {{has been the}} subject of heated debate. The controversial issues include the substitutability between <b>production</b> <b>inputs,</b> the role of time and the economic consequences of irreversibility in the production process. A case in point is the use of Cobb-Douglas type production functions, which completely ignore the physical process underlying the production of a good. We examine these issues in the context of the production of a basic commodity (such as copper or aluminium). We model the extraction and the refinement of a valuable substance which is mixed with waste material, in a way which is fully consistent with the physical constraints of the process. The resulting analytical description of production unambiguously reveals that perfect substitutability between <b>production</b> <b>inputs</b> fails if a corrected thermodynamic approach is used. We analyze the equilibrium pricing of a commodity extracted in an irreversible way. We force consumers to purchase goods using energy as the means of payment and force the firm to account in terms of energy. The resulting market provides the firm with a form of reversibility of its use of energy. Under an energy numeraire, energy resources will naturally be used in a more parsimonious way. <b>Production</b> <b>inputs</b> substitutability Choice of numeraire Energy consumption Energy market...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: There is {{evidence}} that the adoption rate of e-commerce applications in the US construction market varies widely, notwithstanding their potential benefits. This paper focuses on some of the reasons behind the varying approaches of construction firms to adopting a set of these technologies. The study first addresses two main determinants of the production arrangements by firms: the cost of <b>production</b> <b>inputs</b> and the cost related to their coordination, namely the exchange of their information and knowledge content. Then, it illustrates the main tasks that encompass the purchasing process of <b>production</b> <b>inputs.</b> Successively, three main hypotheses concerning the possible use and impact of e-commerce applications on the operations of firms are proposed. In the hypotheses the construction industry’s varying approaches to these technologies is explained according to variables such as the nature of the business transaction under consideration, the size of the buying firm, and type of market situation. The hypotheses are tested through a questionnaire survey that was administered to three large samples of US and Italian contractors. The samples included large, medium and small firms that operate in building and non-building construction. The results of the survey appear to confirm the initial hypotheses. The adoption rate of e-commerce applications varies according to the nature and phases of the transaction process, type of <b>production</b> <b>inputs</b> as well as size and type of construction firm...|$|R
