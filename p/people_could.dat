5|$|In Portland, the {{nickname}} is often attributed to Leo Samuel, {{who founded the}} Oregon Life Insurance Company in 1906 (known today as Standard Insurance Company). Samuel grew roses outside his home and placed a pair of shears outside his garden, so <b>people</b> <b>could</b> snip a rose from his garden to take for themselves.|$|E

5|$|The {{suburb of}} Beaumont, in the City of Burnside, was founded as a {{purpose-built}} village by Sir Samuel Davenport in 1848. The location of Beaumont to Adelaide, a rapidly developing settlement at the time, made {{land in the}} area extremely expensive. Although Adelaide as a new settlement was prospering during the mid-19th century, still very few <b>people</b> <b>could</b> afford the exclusivity of Beaumont.|$|E

5|$|Baltimore is {{less well}} known for its soul music than other major African-American urban areas, such as Philadelphia. However, it was home {{to a number of}} soul record labels in the 1960s and 1970s, {{including}} Ru-Jac (born 1963), whose artists included Joe Quarterman, Arthur Conley, Gene & Eddie, Winfield Parker, The Caressors, Jessie Crawford, The Dynamic Corvettes and Fred Martin. Soul venues in Baltimore in that period included The Royal and Carr's beach in Annapolis, one of the few beaches black <b>people</b> <b>could</b> use.|$|E
5|$|Because Armero's {{hospital}} {{was destroyed in}} the eruption, helicopters moved survivors to nearby hospitals. Six local towns set up makeshift emergency relief clinics, consisting of treatment areas and shelters for the homeless. To help with the treatment, physicians and rescue teams came {{from all over the}} country. Of the 1244 patients spread over the clinics, 150 died from infection or associated complications. Had antibiotics been readily available and all of their lacerations been thoroughly cleaned, many of these <b>people</b> <b>could</b> have been saved.|$|E
5|$|Critics of Plantinga's argument, such as {{philosophers}} Antony Flew, {{have responded}} that it presupposes a libertarian, incompatibilist view {{of free will}} (free will and determinism are metaphysically incompatible), while their view is a compatibilist view of free will (free will and determinism, whether physical or divine, are metaphysically compatible). The view of compatibilists is that God could have created a world containing moral good but no moral evil. In such a world <b>people</b> <b>could</b> have chosen to only perform good deeds, even though all their choices were predestined.|$|E

50|$|In 1974 (and republished in 1984) {{clinical}} psychologist Bobby E.

5|$|During the 20th century, Piccadilly {{became known}} {{as a place to}} acquire heroin. Jazz trumpeter Dizzy Reece {{recalled}} people queuing outside Piccadilly's branch of Boots for heroin pills in the late 1940s. By the 1960s, the street and surrounding area were notorious as the centre of London's illegal drug trade, where heroin and cocaine could be purchased on the black market from unscrupulous chemists. By 1982, up to 20 <b>people</b> <b>could</b> be seen queueing at a chemist dealing in illegal drugs in nearby Shaftesbury Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's {{death was}} mourned nationwide. Over {{two million people}} joined the five-mile long funeral {{procession}} that took over five hours to reach Raj Ghat from Birla house, where he was assassinated. Gandhi's body was transported on a weapons carrier, whose chassis was dismantled overnight to allow a high-floor to be installed so that <b>people</b> <b>could</b> {{catch a glimpse of}} his body. The engine of the vehicle was not used; instead four drag-ropes manned by 50 people each pulled the vehicle. All Indian-owned establishments in London remained closed in mourning as thousands of people from all faiths and denominations and Indians from all over Britain converged at India House in London.|$|E
5|$|His {{impact was}} {{not only on the}} world of education, but also on Argentine {{political}} and social structure. His ideas are now revered as innovative, though at the time they were not widely accepted. He was a self-made man and believed in sociological and economic growth for Latin America, something that the Argentine <b>people</b> <b>could</b> not recognize at the time with the soaring standard of living which came with high prices, high wages, and an increased national debt.|$|E

5|$|Historically, <b>people</b> <b>could</b> {{do little}} to protect their crops from being devastated by locusts, {{although}} eating the insects {{may have been some}} consolation. By the early 20th century, efforts were being made to disrupt the development of the insects by cultivating the soil where eggs were laid, collecting hoppers with catching machines, killing them with flamethrowers, trapping them in ditches, and crushing them with rollers and other mechanical methods. By the 1950s, the organochloride dieldrin was found to be an extremely effective insecticide, but it was later banned from use in most countries because of its persistence in the environment and its bioaccumulation in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|In April 1878, L'Estrange reappeared on the Australian {{scene with}} a new {{performance}} – gas ballooning. The first balloon ascent in Australia {{had been made in}} Melbourne in 1853, with Sydney following five years later in December 1858. The idea that <b>people</b> <b>could</b> be lifted from the ground to fly and return safely fired the imagination of the public, and the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s. No doubt the very real chance of disaster and injury added to the crowd's keen interest, as mishaps were not uncommon.|$|E
5|$|Mary Shelley {{believed}} in the Enlightenment idea that <b>people</b> <b>could</b> improve society through the responsible exercise of political power, but she feared that the irresponsible exercise of power would lead to chaos. In practice, her works largely criticise the way 18th-century thinkers such as her parents believed such change could be brought about. The creature in Frankenstein, for example, reads books associated with radical ideals but the education he gains from them is ultimately useless. Shelley's works reveal her as less optimistic than Godwin and Wollstonecraft; she lacks faith in Godwin's theory that humanity could eventually be perfected.|$|E
50|$|Changes {{in climate}} {{similar to the}} Younger Dryas period or the Little Ice Age punctuate human history. The local effects of these changes may cause crop {{failures}} in multiple consecutive years, leading to warfare as a last-ditch effort at survival. The triggers for climate change are still debated, but ancient <b>peoples</b> <b>could</b> not have predicted or coped with substantial climate changes.|$|R
50|$|A Brulé Lakota from Rosebud, Stranger Horse {{was born}} outside of Wood, South Dakota in 1890. In 1911, {{he was taken}} to Pennsylvania to attend Carlisle Indian Industrial School. There he {{received}} art lessons from Angel De Cora, the accomplished Ho-Chunk painter, whose philosophy was that Native <b>peoples</b> <b>could</b> both maintain cultural pride and a place in mainstream society through art.|$|R
5000|$|This {{period of}} {{allotment}} over tribal lands {{became known as}} the, [...] "Allotment and assimilation era", mainly because the main goal of allotting tribal land was to Americanize Native peoples into mainstream society. The notion that Native <b>peoples</b> <b>could</b> live their lives according to traditional practices and teachings on the reservation was forbidden, thus, assimilation became the epitome of federal Indian policy.|$|R
5|$|New Method for Representing by Dots... (1839) {{put forth}} Braille's {{plan for a}} new writing system with which blind <b>people</b> <b>could</b> write letters that could be read by sighted people. Called decapoint, the system {{combined}} his method of dot-punching with a new specialized grill which Braille devised to overlay the paper. When used with an associated number table (also designed by Braille and requiring memorization), the grill could permit a blind writer to faithfully reproduce the standard alphabet.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer's deft {{handling}} of the July conference impressed his colleagues; his insight and ability to handle even the most difficult people {{came as a surprise}} even to those who knew him well. In the wake of the conference, Oppenheimer saw that while they had {{come to grips with the}} physics, considerable work was still required on the engineering, chemistry, metallurgy and ordnance aspects of building an atomic bomb. He became convinced that bomb design would require an environment where <b>people</b> <b>could</b> freely discuss problems and thereby reduce wasteful duplication of effort. He reasoned that this could best be reconciled with security by creating a central laboratory in an isolated location.|$|E
5|$|Prospect Mountain {{originally}} {{had to use}} an incline railway car to access {{the house at the}} top where <b>people</b> <b>could</b> dance and eat. Construction on the railway began in January 1895 and cost $120,000 total. Construction was finished six months later, with the railway opening on June15, 1895. After failing financially, the railway system ceased operation in 1903. The area was bought and soon donated to the State of New York. The nearby hiking trail that heads up towards the mountaintop is part of the old railway.|$|E

5|$|The Koryak {{of eastern}} Siberia {{have a story}} about the fly agaric (wapaq) which enabled Big Raven to carry a whale to its home. In the story, the deity Vahiyinin ("Existence") spat onto earth, and his spittle became the wapaq, and his saliva becomes the warts. After {{experiencing}} the power of the wapaq, Raven was so exhilarated that he told it to grow forever on earth so his children, the <b>people,</b> <b>could</b> learn from it.

5|$|The third letter openly {{incorporates}} Swift's {{argument that}} political authority {{stems from the}} consent of a population. As such, the third letter {{has been seen as}} a response in part to the Declaratory Act, which had undermined the independence and the authority of Irish legislature and judiciary in favour of the British. The Declaratory Act removed the ability for any in Ireland to speak for the people of Ireland, and it was necessary for the act to be removed before the <b>people</b> <b>could</b> be heard.|$|E
5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, {{regardless}} of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split {{the ground at the}} place where a treasure lay so that <b>people</b> <b>could</b> locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was a black man in chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E
