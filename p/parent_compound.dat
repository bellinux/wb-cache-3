40|$|International audienceSeven novel ferrocenic derivatives, {{compounds}} 1 - 7, were synthesized from steroidal drugs by Aldol condensation reaction. The derivatives were purified by chromatography, {{and their}} structures were determined {{on the basis}} of HR-ESI-MS and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The purity of all derivatives was more than 95 %.

25|$|Venlafaxine is well absorbed, with {{at least}} 92% of an oral dose being absorbed into {{systemic}} circulation. It is extensively metabolized in the liver via the CYP2D6 isoenzyme to desvenlafaxine (O-desmethylvenlafaxine), which is just as potent a SNRI as the <b>parent</b> <b>compound,</b> meaning that the differences in metabolism between extensive and poor metabolisers are not clinically {{important in terms of}} efficacy. Side effects, however, are reported to be more severe in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers. Steady-state concentrations of venlafaxine and its metabolite are attained in the blood within 3 days. Therapeutic effects are usually achieved within 3 to 4 weeks. No accumulation of venlafaxine has been observed during chronic administration in healthy subjects. The primary route of excretion of venlafaxine and its metabolites is via the kidneys. The half-life of venlafaxine is relatively short, so patients are directed to adhere to a strict medication routine, avoiding missing a dose. Even a single missed dose can result in withdrawal symptoms.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the ability of the sulfate metabolites of hydroxytyrosol (HT) and tyrosol (TYR) to act as antioxidants counteracting the pro-oxidant effect of oxidized cholesterol in intestinal cells. For this purpose, we synthesized sulfate metabolites of HT and TYR using a chemical methodology and examined their antioxidant activity in Caco- 2 monolayers in comparison with the <b>parent</b> <b>compounds.</b> Exposure to oxidized cholesterol led to ROS production, oxidative damage, as indicated by the MDA increase, a decrease of reduced glutathione concentration and an enhancement of glutathione peroxidase activity. All the tested compounds were able to counteract the oxidizing action of oxidized cholesterol; HT and TYR sulfate metabolites showed an efficiency in protecting intestinal cells comparable to that of the <b>parent</b> <b>compounds,</b> strengthening the assumption that the potential beneficial effect of the <b>parent</b> <b>compounds</b> is retained, although extensive metabolisation occurs, the resulting metabolites being able to exert a biological action themselves...|$|R

25|$|However, {{despite the}} greater in vitro {{activity}} {{of some of}} its metabolites, it has been determined that oxycodone itself is responsible for 83.0% and 94.8% of its analgesic effect following oral and intravenous administration, respectively. Oxymorphone plays only a minor role, being responsible for 15.8% and 4.5% of the analgesic effect of oxycodone after oral and intravenous administration, respectively. Although the CYP2D6 genotype and the route of administration result in differential rates of oxymorphone formation, the unchanged <b>parent</b> <b>compound</b> remains the major contributor to the overall analgesic effect of oxycodone. In contrast to oxycodone and oxymorphone, noroxycodone and noroxymorphone, while also potent MOR agonists, poorly cross the blood-brain-barrier into the central nervous system, and for this reason, are only minimally analgesic in comparison. In accordance, while higher CYP2D6 activity increases the effects of oxycodone (owing to increased conversion into oxymorphone), higher CYP3A4 activity has the opposite effect, and decreases the effects of oxycodone (owing to increased metabolism into noroxycodone and noroxymorphone).|$|E
