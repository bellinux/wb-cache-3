5|$|In {{the event}} that a person lacks standing, there is a {{possibility}} that he or she may be able to ask the Attorney-General to allow him or her to bring a relator action. In this scenario, the Attorney-General would be the nominal <b>plaintiff</b> <b>in</b> the judicial review proceedings, but the case would actually be conducted by the individual. Bringing a relator action is one means of circumventing the requirement of standing on the part of the individual applicant, because the Attorney-General has an interest in upholding the law for the public benefit.|$|E
5|$|Neither treaty {{made any}} {{provision}} {{as to the}} mode or {{manner in which the}} removal of the Indians or surrender of the reservations was to take place. The grantees have assumed that they were authorized to take forcible possession of the two reservations, or of the four, as the case would have been under the first treaty. The <b>plaintiff</b> <b>in</b> this case was expelled by force; and unless this mode of removal can be sustained, the recovery against the defendants for the trespass was right, and must be affirmed.|$|E
5|$|The named <b>plaintiff</b> <b>in</b> the case, Deborah Peterson, is {{the sister}} of {{a victim of the}} Beirut barracks bombings; joined by victims and other {{relatives}} of victims, she had won a default judgment in 2003 against Iran for its role in the bombings. Because of the large number of plaintiffs in the case—almost 1,000—the judge appointed special masters to determine each plaintiff's right to collect damages and appropriate amount of damages; in 2007, the judge entered a default judgment against Iran for $2,656,944,877 in damages.|$|E

5|$|After the {{publication}} of Go Quietly, Agnew largely disappeared from public view. In a rare TV interview in 1980, he advised young people not to go into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. In 1983 a Maryland court ordered him to pay the state the sum of $268,000, including interest and penalties, {{the sum of the}} bribes he had taken while a public employee. Agnew did not dispute the judgement, but seven years later applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible. He was briefly in the news in 1987, when as the <b>plaintiff</b> <b>in</b> Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he gave the public some insight into his recent business activities.|$|E
5|$|As {{attorney}} general, Crittenden issued {{only one}} notable opinion. The <b>plaintiff</b> <b>in</b> {{the case was}} an individual whose property had been damaged during Andrew Jackson's invasion of {{what would become the}} Florida Territory in 1818. The case was still being adjudicated in 1841. A Florida court found in favor of the plaintiff and ordered the federal government to compensate him for the damages and to pay him interest on his claim from the time the damages were incurred. Treasury Secretary Thomas Ewing asked Crittenden whether the court had the authority to award interest and whether or not it should be paid. Crittenden opined that it did not, and Ewing did not pay the interest. Crittenden's opinion was used as a precedent in similar cases by future attorneys general.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of Moxon's {{legal work}} is Scientology-related. He {{has served as}} Commissioner of the Scientology-affiliated {{organization}} Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR). He represented the Church of Scientology in 1988 in a billion-dollar class action lawsuit against the organization by former Scientologists which was dismissed in Los Angeles Superior Court. In 1990 Moxon represented the organization in a suit against the Internal Revenue Service {{in an attempt to}} gain access to information about Scientology held by the IRS. He assisted 50 Scientologists in filing separate lawsuits against the organization Cult Awareness Network (CAN), which led to the bankruptcy of the organization. He represented the <b>plaintiff</b> <b>in</b> the Jason Scott case against CAN and cult deprogrammer Rick Ross.|$|E

5|$|The <b>plaintiff</b> <b>in</b> Lines International {{argued that}} the {{guidelines}} adopted by the multi-agency committee {{set up by the}} PSA, STPB and GSB were invalid as the committee had no existence at law. The High Court held that there was nothing unlawful or even intrinsically wrong with these government agencies setting up such a committee to discuss matters of relevance to their respective jurisdictions as long as each agency made its own decisions within the ambit of its own statutory powers. The notion that such a committee fettered PSA's discretion was dismissed by a further finding of fact that the ad-hoc committee had not acted as an entity in itself. Enforcement and appropriate action were left to the agencies. A meeting attended by the plaintiff's representatives at which the guidelines relating to cruises-to-nowhere were announced was facilitated by a moderator rather than a chairperson, and each of the agencies read out guidelines which they themselves would be adopting and implementing.|$|E

Such a course is suggested to the Attorney General.|$|E
