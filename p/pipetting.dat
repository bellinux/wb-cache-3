These stock plates themselves are not directly used in experiments; instead, separate assay plates are created as needed.

40|$|We {{describe}} highly localized electrochemical {{measurements and}} imaging using a simple, mobile theta <b>pipet</b> cell. Each channel (diameter < 500 nm) of a tapered theta <b>pipet</b> {{is filled with}} electrolyte solution and a Ag/AgCl electrode, between which a bias is applied, resulting in a conductance current across a thin meniscus of solution {{at the end of}} the <b>pipet,</b> which is typically deployed in air or a controlled gaseous environment. When the position of the <b>pipet</b> normal to a surface of interest is oscillated, an oscillating component in the conductance current is generated when the meniscus {{at the end of the}} probe comes into contact with the surface and undergoes periodic (reversible) deformation, so as to modulate the solution resistance. This oscillating current component can be used to maintain gentle contact of the solution from the <b>pipet</b> cell with the surface and as a set point for high resolution topographical imaging with the <b>pipet.</b> Simultaneously, the mean conductance current that flows between the <b>pipet</b> channels can be measured and is sensitive to the local nature of the interface, informing one, for example, on wettability and ion flow into or out of the surface investigated. Furthermore, conductor or semiconductor surfaces can be connected as a working electrode, with one of the electrodes in the <b>pipet</b> serving as a quasi-reference electrode. This <b>pipet</b> cell then constitutes part of a dynamic electrochemical cell, with which direct voltammetric-amperometric imaging can be carried out simultaneously with conductance and topographical imaging. This provides multifunctional electrochemical maps of surfaces and interfaces at high spatial resolution:Me prospects for the use of this new methodology widely are highlighted through exemplar studies and a brief discussion of future applications. ...|$|R
40|$|Observation of cell {{membrane}} buckling and cell folding in micropipette aspiration experiments {{was used to}} evaluate the bending rigidity of the red blood {{cell membrane}}. The suction pressure required to buckle the membrane surface initially was found to be about one-half to two-thirds of the pressure that caused the cell to fold and move up the <b>pipet.</b> A simple analytical model for buckling of a membrane disk supported at inner and outer radii correlates well with the observed buckling pressures vs. <b>pipet</b> radii. The buckling pressure is predicted to increase in inverse proportion to the cube of the <b>pipet</b> radius; also, the buckling pressure depends inversely on the radial distance to the toroidal rim of the cell, normalized by the <b>pipet</b> radius. As such, the pressure required to buckle the membrane with 1 X 10 (- 4) cm diam <b>pipet</b> would be about four times greater than with a 2 X 10 (- 4) cm <b>pipet.</b> This is the behavior observed experimentally.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model and an experiment are presented {{for determining the}} bending modulus of a bilayer vesicle membrane. The vesicle is held with a <b>pipet</b> having a radius between 1 and 2 microns, and {{the tension in the}} membrane is changed by changing the suction pressure.

40|$|An {{economic}} semiautomatic <b>pipet</b> {{is described}} with its applications.
