30|$|<b>Pile</b> <b>foundations</b> are {{structural}} {{elements that are}} used to transfer superstructure loads deep into the ground [1]. Several methods for estimating pile bearing capacity are proposed. These include experimental, numerical and analytical methods [2, 3]. Since the interaction of <b>pile</b> <b>foundations</b> and soils is complex and not entirely understood, the applicability of these methods in predicting the bearing capacity of <b>pile</b> <b>foundations</b> is limited. This complex interaction has encouraged researchers to apply AI techniques to predict the ultimate bearing capacity of <b>pile</b> <b>foundations.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Pile</b> <b>foundations</b> {{near the}} {{shoreline}} were severely damaged during the Hyogo-ken Nanbu Earthquake, January 17, 1995. This was obviously caused by soil liquefaction. The {{objective of this}} study is to investigate the responses of <b>pile</b> <b>foundations</b> due to liquefaction induced lateral spreading. Earthquake response analyses of a structure on <b>pile</b> <b>foundations</b> are conducted using a numerical model taking into account the effect of excess pore water pressure. Observed strong motion in a borehole array at Port Island is employed as the input motion to the soil-pile foundations-structure system. As a result, it is found that soil responses near the shoreline are greatly affected by liquefaction induced lateral spreading, and that large pile bending moments are mainly caused by kinematic interactions at the pile head and at GL- 19 m, the lower boundary of the reclaimed soil, and that the damaged mechanism of <b>pile</b> <b>foundations</b> varies greatly with distance from the shoreline...|$|R

40|$|The {{damage has}} {{occurred}} on residential houses built on expansive soils. The {{weight of the}} walls and roof of the houses is transferred onto <b>pile</b> <b>foundations</b> through suspended tie beams and columns, respectively. The typical pile used to support the house was 30 cm in diameter and it was penetrated into the depth of 600 cm. The slabs or floors were rested on the fills. This {{study was conducted to}} determine all potential sources that initiated the settlement and damages to the houses. Site investigation to each and every houses that experienced settlement and damages was conducted to gather and inventory the pattern of the cracks or damages. The result of site investigation showed that there were no damages induced by swelling, but the settlements and cracks were triggered by settlement, instead. It was also noticed that the settlement of <b>piled</b> <b>foundations</b> located on the area that susceptible to the water infiltration relatively larger than those <b>piled</b> <b>foundation</b> in the covered area. Therefore, it was concluded that, based on the analysis, the damages which occurred on the residential ordinary houses were mainly caused by the settlement of the <b>piled</b> <b>foundations</b> and the fills due to the soil softening. ...|$|R
