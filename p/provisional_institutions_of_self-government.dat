None {{of the participants in the}} proceedings had argued that those institutions had not made the declaration. Nonetheless, the Court determined that the declaration of independence was not issued by the Assembly of Kosovo or otherwise by <b>Provisional</b> <b>Institutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Self-Government</b> or any other official body. Once this crucial determination was made, the question the Court had to answer no longer concerned any action of the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Institutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Self-Government,</b> as the Court had determined that those institutions had not made the declaration of independence.|$|E
25|$|The {{arguments}} presented are not {{in general}} arguments against the moral right of Kosovo Albanians to self-determination, but focus on the legality or otherwise of the unilateral action of the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Institutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Self-Government.</b> As UNSCR 1244 vested all authority in Kosovo in the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, {{the argument is that}} the Provisional Institutions had no power to declare independence.|$|E

In December 2002, Haradinaj's brother Daut was sentenced by a UN court in Kosovo for his involvement in the kidnapping and murder of four Kosovo Albanians, who belonged to the FARK, an armed formation of Kosovo Albanians and rivals of the KLA, to five years in prison. Enver Haradinaj, another brother of Ramush, was assassinated in April 2005 in a drive-by shootout in Kosovo. According to the UN security forces, there was a confrontation between rival Kosovo-Albanian clans.

2500|$|Whether the {{declaration}} {{was in fact}} an official act of the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Institutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Self-Government</b> was unclear; in the end, the Court determined it was issued by [...] "representatives {{of the people of}} Kosovo" [...] acting outside the normal <b>Provisional</b> <b>Institutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Self-Government.</b> This was significant, since the Serbian argument was that the Kosovo <b>Provisional</b> <b>Institutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Self-Government</b> had exceeded the authority given to them by the Constitutional Framework (promulgated by UNMIK).

2500|$|On 27 March 2008 Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremić said Serbia would {{request the}} International Court of Justice {{to review the}} {{legality}} of Kosovo's declaration of independence.

The United Nations General Assembly adopted this proposal on 8 October 2008 with 77 votes in favor, 6 votes against and 74 abstentions. On 22 July 2010 {{the court ruled that}} the declaration did not breach international law, because in general international law does not deal with declarations of independence and because in this specific case the declaration was not issued by the Assembly of Kosovo, <b>Provisional</b> <b>Institutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Self-Government,</b> or any other official body and thus the authors, who named themselves [...] "representatives of the people of Kosovo" [...] were not bound by the Constitutional Framework (promulgated by United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)) or by UNSCR1244 that is addressed only to United Nations Member States and organs of the United Nations.
