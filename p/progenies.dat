25|$|The lipid world theory postulates {{that the}} first {{self-replicating}} object was lipid-like. It is known that phospholipids form lipid bilayers in water while under agitation—the same structure as in cell membranes. These molecules were not present on early Earth, but other amphiphilic long-chain molecules also form membranes. Furthermore, these bodies may expand (by insertion of additional lipids), and under excessive expansion may undergo spontaneous splitting which preserves {{the same size and}} composition of lipids in the two <b>progenies.</b> The main idea in this theory is that the molecular composition of the lipid bodies is the preliminary way for information storage, and evolution led to the appearance of polymer entities such as RNA or DNA that may store information favourably. Studies on vesicles from potentially prebiotic amphiphiles have so far been limited to systems containing one or two types of amphiphiles. This in contrast to the output of simulated prebiotic chemical reactions, which typically produce very heterogeneous mixtures of compounds.|$|E
25|$|Group {{selection}} is often criticized {{to be too}} slow to happen in real biology. However, Jiang-Nan Yang recently showed with an individual-based model that the evolution of altruistic ageing occurs under fairly general conditions by kin/group selection. Group selection can be based on population viscosity (limited offspring dispersal, first proposed by Hamilton (1964) for kin selection) that is widely present in natural populations. This population structure builds a continuum between individual selection, kin selection, kin group selection and group selection without a clear boundary for each level. Although early theoretical models by D.S. Wilson et al. (1992) and Taylor (1992) showed that pure population viscosity cannot lead to cooperation/altruism because of the exact cancelling out of the benefit of kin cooperation {{and the cost of}} kin competition, this exact cancelling out also suggests that any additional benefit of local cooperation would be sufficient for the evolution of cooperation. Mitteldorf and D.S. Wilson (2000) later showed that if the population is allowed to fluctuate, then local populations can temporarily store the benefit of local cooperation and promote the evolution of altruism. By assuming individual differences in adaptations, Yang (2013) further showed that the benefit of local altruism can be stored in the form of offspring quality and thus promote the evolution of altruistic ageing even if the population does not fluctuate, this is because local competition among the young will result in an increased average local inherited fitness of survived <b>progenies</b> after the elimination of the less adapted by natural selection, since the young do not have strong age-associated abilities and have to depend more on inherited abilities to compete. In Yang (2013)'s model, altruistic ageing is stabilized by higher-level selection instead of just kin selection.|$|E
40|$|Background: Maternal {{effects on}} <b>progeny</b> traits are common and these can profoundly alter <b>progeny</b> life history. Maternal {{effects can be}} adaptive, {{representing}} attempts to appropriately match offspring phenotype to the expected environment and are often mediated via trade-offs between <b>progeny</b> number and quality. Here we have investigated the effect of maternal food availability on <b>progeny</b> life history in the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Methodology/Principal Findings: The maternal environment affects both reproductive traits and <b>progeny</b> development. Comparisons of the <b>progeny</b> of worms from high and low maternal food environments indicates that low maternal food availability reduces <b>progeny</b> reproduction in good environments, increases <b>progeny</b> reproduction in poor environments and decreases the likelihood that <b>progeny</b> will develop as dauer larvae. These analyses also indicate that the effects on <b>progeny</b> are not a simple consequence of changes in maternal body size, but are associated {{with an increase in}} the size of eggs produced by worms at low maternal food availabilities. Conclusions/Significance: These results indicate that the maternal environment affects both <b>progeny</b> reproduction and development in C. elegans and therefore that all <b>progeny</b> are not equal. The observed effects are consistent with changes to egg provisioning, which are beneficial in harsh environments, and of changes to <b>progeny</b> development, which are beneficial in harsh environments and detrimental in benign environments.

In particular, enlarged <b>progeny</b> from orange sires dispersed farther, while enlarged <b>progeny</b> from yellow sires were more philopatric. <b>Progeny</b> from blue sires were unaffected by egg size manipulations. Egg manipulations and natural variation generally had concordant effects indicative of causation. However, asymmetry of gigantization and miniaturization on <b>progeny</b> dispersal from some sire genotypes suggest the involvement of maternal factors besides egg size.

60|$|A Poem with so bold a title, and a name prefixed {{from which}} the {{handling}} of so serious a subject would not be expected, may reasonably oblige the author to say somewhat in defence, both of himself and of his undertaking. In the first place, if it be objected to me, that, being a layman, I ought not to have concerned myself with speculations which belong to the profession of divinity; I could answer, that perhaps laymen, with equal advantages of parts and knowledge, are not the most incompetent judges of sacred things; but in the due sense of my own weakness and want of learning, I plead not this: I pretend not to make myself a judge of faith in others, but only {{to make a confession}} of my own. I lay no unhallowed hand upon the ark, but wait on it, with the reverence that becomes me, at a distance. In the next place, I will ingenuously confess, that the helps I have used in this small treatise, were many of them taken from the works of our own reverend divines of the Church of England: so that the weapons with which I combat irreligion, are already consecrated; though I suppose they may be taken down as lawfully as the sword of Goliah was by David, when they are to be employed for the common cause against the enemies of piety. I intend not by this to entitle them to any of my errors, which yet I hope are only those of charity to mankind; and such as my own charity has caused me to commit, that of others may more easily excuse. Being naturally inclined to scepticism in philosophy, I have no reason to impose my opinions in a subject which is above it; but whatever they are, I submit them with all reverence to my mother church, accounting them no farther mine, than as they are authorised, or at least uncondemned by her. And, indeed, to secure myself on this side, I have used the necessary precaution of showing this paper, before it was published, to a judicious and learned friend, a man indefatigably zealous {{in the service of the}} church and state; and whose writings have highly deserved of both. He was pleased to approve the body of the discourse, and I hope he is more my friend than to do it out of complaisance: it is true he had too good a taste to like it all; and amongst some other faults recommended to my second view, what I have written perhaps too boldly on St Athanasius, which he advised me wholly to omit. I am sensible enough that I had done more prudently to have followed his opinion: but then I could not have satisfied myself that I had done honestly not to have written what was my own. It has always been my thought, that heathens who never did, nor without miracle could, hear of the name of Christ, were yet in a possibility of salvation. Neither will it enter easily into my belief, that before the coming of our Saviour the whole world, excepting only the Jewish nation, should lie under the inevitable necessity of everlasting punishment, for want of that revelation, which was confined to so small a spot of ground as that of Palestine. Among the sons of Noah we read of one only who was accursed; and if a blessing in the ripeness of time was reserved for Japhet (of whose progeny we are), it seems unaccountable to me, why so many generations of the same offspring, as preceded our Saviour in the flesh, should be all involved in one common condemnation, and yet that their posterity should be entitled to the hopes of salvation: as if a bill of exclusion had passed only on the fathers, which debarred not the sons from their succession: or that so many ages had been delivered over to hell, and so many reserved for heaven; and that the devil had the first choice, and God the next. Truly I am apt to think, that the revealed religion which was taught by Noah to all his sons, might continue for some ages in the whole posterity. That afterwards it was included wholly in the family of Shem is manifest; but when the <b>progenies</b> of Ham and Japhet swarmed into colonies, and those colonies were subdivided into many others, in process of time their descendants lost by little and little the primitive and purer rites of divine worship, retaining only the notion of one Deity; to which succeeding generations added others: for men took their degrees in those ages from conquerors to gods. Revelation being thus eclipsed to almost all mankind, the light of nature, as the next in dignity, was substituted; and that is it which St Paul concludes to be the rule of the heathens, and by which they are hereafter to be judged. If my supposition be true, then the consequence which I have assumed in my poem may be also true; namely, that Deism, or the principles of natural worship, are only the faint remnants or dying flames of revealed religion in the posterity of Noah: and that our modern philosophers--nay, and some of our philosophising divines--have too much exalted the faculties of our souls, when they have maintained that by their force mankind has been able to find out that there is one supreme agent or intellectual Being which we call God: that praise and prayer are his due worship; and the rest of those deducements, which I am confident are the remote effects of revelation, and unattainable by our discourse, I mean as simply considered, and without the benefit of divine illumination. So that we have not lifted up ourselves to God, by the weak pinions of our reason, but he has been pleased to descend to us; and what Socrates said of him, what Plato writ, and the rest of the heathen philosophers of several nations, is all no more than the twilight of revelation, after the sun of it was set in the race of Noah. That there is something above us, some principle of motion, our reason can apprehend, though it cannot discover what it is by its own virtue. And, indeed, it is very improbable, that we, who by the strength of our faculties cannot enter into the knowledge of any Being, not so much as of our own, should be able to find out by them, that supreme nature, which we cannot otherwise define than by saying it is infinite; as if infinite were definable, or infinity a subject for our narrow understanding. They who would prove religion by reason, do but weaken the cause which they endeavour to support: it is to take away the pillars from our faith, and to prop it only with a twig; it is to design a tower like that of Babel, which, if it were possible, as it is not, to reach heaven, would come to nothing by the confusion of the workmen. For every man is building a several way; impotently conceited of his own model and his own materials: reason is always striving, and always at a loss; and of necessity it must so come to pass, while it is exercised about that which is not its own proper object. Let us be content at last to know God by his own methods; at least, so much of him as he is pleased to reveal to us in the sacred Scriptures: to apprehend them to be the Word of God is all our reason has to do; for all beyond it is the work of faith, which is the seal of Heaven impressed upon our human understanding.|$|E

40|$|Milk Yield, Milk Fat Yield, Milk Protein Yield and Days in Milk of 72, 480 {{dairy cows}} of Holstein-Friesian, Jersey and their {{reciprocal}} crossbred were analysed. The main {{objective of this}} study was to investigate possible use of crossbred <b>progeny</b> records to genetically evaluate sires. Bulls of each breed were evaluated separately using their purebred, crossbred or both purebred and crossbred <b>progeny.</b> First, crossbred <b>progeny</b> were used without including genetic groups. Secondly, crossbred <b>progeny</b> were used with genetic groups included. Rank correlations for different types of evaluations were calculated. In total, 10 different comparisons, 5 for each breed, were performed. The expected correlation of ranks of sires obtained using different data sets were estimated where applicable. Reliability and Prediction Error Variance of sire proofs were estimated both by an approximate method and direct calculation. Over-estimation of reliability and under-estimation of Prediction Error Variance by the approximate method was given. High correlations between ranks of Holstein-Friesian sires evaluated using different data sets were observed, while, the correlation between ranks of Jersey sires evaluated using purebred <b>progeny</b> with ranks of the same sires evaluated using only crossbred <b>progeny</b> was less than expected. Correlations of ranks of Jersey sires evaluated using all <b>progeny</b> with ranks of the same sires evaluated using only crossbred <b>progeny</b> were also low. After plotting EBVs of sires of each breed obtained using only purebred against EBVs of the same sires obtained using both purebred and crossbred <b>progeny,</b> two lines with slightly different slopes were observed. The reasons for the formation of these two lines were investigated. It was found that the number of effective crossbred <b>progeny</b> of sires was affecting the regression of EBVs of sires obtained using all <b>progeny</b> on EBVs of same sires obtained using only purebred <b>progeny.</b> It was concluded that crossbred <b>progeny</b> of Holstein-Friesian sires may be used to assist in their evaluation under New Zealand conditions, but, further research is recommended before using crossbred <b>progeny</b> of Jersey sires in sire evaluation...|$|R
