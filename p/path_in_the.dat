5|$|A {{variant of}} the minimax path problem has also been {{considered}} for sets of points in the Euclidean plane. As in the undirected graph problem, this Euclidean minimax path problem can be solved efficiently by finding a Euclidean minimum spanning tree: every <b>path</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tree is a minimax path. However, the problem becomes more complicated when a path is desired that not only minimizes the hop length but also, among paths with the same hop length, minimizes or approximately minimizes the total length of the path. The solution can be approximated using geometric spanners.|$|E
5|$|As a {{tropical}} cyclone, Paine brought rainfall {{to most of}} Mexico, including heavier amounts along the coastline and interior northern Oaxaca.

Light precipitation fell in the southern portion of the Baja California Peninsula, and where Paine moved ashore, upwards of 7inches (18cm) fell across its <b>path.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> area around where it made landfall, strong winds knocked down trees and caused disruptions to city services.|$|E
5|$|Hancock {{was born}} on 31May 1907 in Perth, Western Australia, and educated at Hale School in Wembley Downs. He was the elder cousin of future mining magnate Lang Hancock.

His preferred career <b>path</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> military was engineering, {{and it was only}} when he found that there was no vacancy in his corps of choice, and that he had instead been earmarked for the artillery, that he put his name forward for transfer to the Royal Australian Air Force. He enlisted in the RAAF on 1February 1929, and undertook flying instruction at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, later that year.|$|E

5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's {{interest}} in pantheism was whetted by the folkloristic studies of Alexander Afanasyev. That author's standard work, The Poetic Outlook on Nature by the Slavs, became Rimsky-Korsakov's pantheistic bible.

5|$|About 19hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning from Apalachicola to Venice, Florida, which was preceded by {{a tropical storm}} watch six hours prior. As the storm intensified further, the NHC issued a hurricane warning from Apalachicola to Anclote Key, and extended the tropical storm warning westward to Fort Walton Beach. The agency later issued a tropical storm warning for the Atlantic coast from Cape Canaveral to Little River Inlet in South Carolina. Officials ordered evacuations for barrier islands in nine Florida counties along the gulf coast, and about 3,000people stayed in shelters. Government offices closed along the storm's projected <b>path</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state. Later, the storm forced the cancellation of part of Bob Dole's bus tour through New York, and postponed {{a search for the}} wreck of TWA Flight 800.

5|$|Early on, {{the player}} {{is given the}} choice between three {{different}} game modes, each with unique cutscenes, puzzles to solve and locations to visit: the Team Path, the Wits Path, and the Fists <b>Path.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Team Path, protagonist Indiana Jones is joined by his partner Sophia Hapgood who will provide support throughout the game. The Wits Path features an abundance of complex puzzles, while the Fists Path focuses heavily on action sequences and fist fighting, the latter of which is completely optional {{in the other two}} modes. Atypical for LucasArts titles, it is possible for the player character to die at certain points in the game, though dangerous situations were designed to be easily recognizable. A score system, the Indy Quotient Points, keeps track of the puzzles solved, the obstacles overcome and the important objects found.|$|E

5|$|If one removes from a 1-tree one of {{the edges}} in its cycle, {{the result is a}} tree. Reversing this process, if one augments a tree by {{connecting}} any two of its vertices by a new edge, the result is a 1-tree; the <b>path</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tree connecting the two endpoints of the added edge, together with the added edge itself, form the 1-tree's unique cycle. If one augments a 1-tree by adding an edge that connects one of its vertices to a newly added vertex, the result is again a 1-tree, with one more vertex; an alternative method for constructing 1-trees is to start with a single cycle and then repeat this augmentation operation any number of times. The edges of any 1-tree can be partitioned in a unique way into two subgraphs, one of which is a cycle and the other of which is a forest, such that each tree of the forest contains exactly one vertex of the cycle.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{moved slowly}} over Cuba {{for two days}} before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near the Bahamas. It was expected to continue out to sea, although it stalled and resumed its previous westward <b>path.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas, heavy rainfall and high tides caused flooding, which killed five people and left $15.5million in damage. Hurricane-force winds occurred throughout the Florida Keys, where 160homes and 190trailers were damaged. Salt spray damaged crops in the region, and there was $5million in damage and four deaths. In the Straits of Florida, Inez capsized a boat of Cuban refugees, killing 45people. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, a helicopter crashed after carrying evacuees from an oil rig, killing 11people. The hurricane threatened the northern Yucatán Peninsula, and although it remained offshore, Inez produced flooding and caused some power outages. At its final landfall, Inez flooded portions of Tamaulipas and cut off roads to Tampico. About 84,000people were left homeless, and the hurricane destroyed at least 2,500houses. Damage was estimated at $104million, and there were 74deaths in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The left {{edge of the}} {{conveyor}} belt is sharp due to higher density air moving in from the west forcing a sharp slope to the cold front. An area of stratiform precipitation develops poleward of the warm front along {{the conveyor}} belt. Active precipitation poleward of the warm front implies potential for greater development of the cyclone. A portion of this conveyor belt turns to the right (left in the Southern Hemisphere), aligning with the upper level westerly flow. However, the western portion of this belt wraps around the northwest (southwest in the Southern Hemisphere) side of the cyclone, which can contain moderate to heavy precipitation. If the air mass is cold enough, the precipitation falls {{in the form of}} heavy snow. Theory from the 1980s talked about the presence of a cold conveyor belt originating north of the warm front and flowing along a clockwise <b>path</b> (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern hemisphere) into the main belt of the westerlies aloft, but there has been conflicting evidence {{as to whether or not}} this phenomenon actually exists.|$|E

5|$|The route was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. Although it began in Youngstown and ended in Newstead as it does today, the initial routing of NY93 deviated from the modern <b>path</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of the city of Lockport. From Cambria to Lockport's eastern suburbs, the highway originally used NY425, Lower Mountain Road, Akron Road, and a series of streets in Lockport. NY93 was moved onto NY104 and Junction Road in Cambria in the 1940s, and altered to bypass Lockport to the south on a new highway and Robinson and Dysinger roads in 1991. In 2006, NY93 was realigned west of Lockport to continue south on Junction Road to NY31. The change removed NY93 from Upper Mountain Road, a county-owned highway that {{had been part of the}} route since the 1930s.|$|E
