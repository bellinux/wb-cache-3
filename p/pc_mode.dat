5000|$|For {{operation}} in either hc or <b>pc</b> <b>mode,</b> routine calibration in commercial instruments is usually accomplished with built-in electric heaters. The {{performance of the}} electrical heaters can in turn be validated using specimens of known heat capacity or which produce chemical reactions whose heat production per unit mass is known from thermodynamics (Wadsö and Goldberg 2001). In either hc or <b>pc</b> <b>mode,</b> the resulting signal is a computer-recordable voltage, calibrated to represent specimen μ W-range heat flow vs. time. Specifically, if no significant thermal gradients exist in the specimen, then P = eC U [...] t (dU/dt), where P is heat flow (i.e. μ W), εC is the calibration constant, U the measured potential difference across the thermopile, and t the time constant. Under steady-state conditions—for example during {{the release of a}} constant electrical calibration current, this simplifies to P = eC U. (Wadsö and Goldberg 2001).|$|E
5000|$|Some IMC {{instruments}} operate (or {{can also}} be operated) as power compensation (pc) calorimeters. In this case, {{in order to maintain}} the specimen at the set temperature, heat produced is compensated using a Peltier-Seebeck device. Heat consumed is compensated either by an electric heater or by reversing the polarity of the device (van Herwaarden, 2000). If a given instrument is operated in <b>pc</b> <b>mode</b> rather than hc, the precision of heat flow measurement remains the same (e.g. ca. ±0.2 μW). The advantage of compensation mode is a smaller time constant [...] - [...] i.e. the time needed to detect a given heat flow pulse is ca.10X shorter than in conduction mode. The disadvantage is a ca. 10X smaller dynamic range compared to hc mode.|$|E
