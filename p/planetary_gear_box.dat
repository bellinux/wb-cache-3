This project has lead to a complete proposition, a description of manufacturing and is founded upon an asynchronous motor with a thoroughgoing drive shaft with two <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> on both side of the motor. This solution is a result of an evaluation of different concept (chapter 2), regarding common motors and gears on the market. The reason that we used this motor and gears is mainly due to the minor space requirements that such solution can accomplish, with an inline drive train. The solution shall be able to fit different configurations of screw jacks, regarding the size of motor, ratio of gears and the length between the jacks. This is mainly done with adjustments of the holder, to fit the motor {{and the rest of the}} drive train. But this is basically the same solution.

Further, due to the conditions in the paper machine, a cover has been designed to prevent the paper pulp to come in direct contact with motor and drive train.   The requirements that Metso Paper has set up is that the solution should be able to come as a module, meaning in our case that the motor, drive train and holder can be delivered as one unit together with a parallel shaft that connects the two screw jacks. ...|$|R
50|$|The car used {{a custom}} {{designed}} electronic shifting actuator {{made from a}} standard RC car motor and a <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> from a power drill. While the actuator was very powerful, the system required an electronic controller because the motor could not be turned {{on for more than}} a quarter second without damaging the brushes or windings. The overall actuator weight was around 1.2 lbs. There were positive and negative results of the system. With new brushes in the motor and proper tweaking it was capable of very fast shifts (~15 ms), and was able to perform very well for automatic up-shifting during acceleration runs. However, the brushed motor was unreliable in this implementation (very low rev, turning only a few turns at a time, commonly stalled), which meant that the motor required constant tinkering. Further problems included the use of 1st gear on this car which led to frequent neutral-out conditions.|$|E

This paper shows a method of modeling the transition process during <b>gear</b> shifting in <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> trains. The simulation model is developed with in order to provide virtual research of <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> trains, which would positively decrease the number of real prototypes, thus considerably saving time and contributing to the quality improvement of the final product (<b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> train) and vehicles in general. Introduction Modeling of gear shift processes has been carried out on the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> type Ravigneaux used in <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> trains of motor vehicles. The model was developed modularly, so that more simulation models can be added to the whole. At the same time each subsystem is a model for itself and can be used independently from the main model. Simplified engine model Bearing in mind that, for the simulation of the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> which {{is the subject of this}} paper, the necessary input parameters are in the form of engine torque Mm, angular velocity and motor ωm moment of inertia of rotating engine components reduced to the input shaft gear, a simplified model of an internal combustion engine has been formed. Model of external load External load resistance is in the form of the torque Mt occurring on the drive wheel of the vehicle. On the other hand, this load is defined by the moment of inertia of rotating elements from the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> to the drive wheel, reduced to the output shaft. Model of friction transmission simulation Transmission power control in <b>planetary</b> <b>gears</b> is achieved through friction components. The output size of this subsystem is the moment of carrying the friction assembly. Simulation model of the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> train The model simulation of the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> type Ravigneaux was formed in accordance with the kinematic scheme of the gear train. The gears are presented as a solid body defined by mass, moment of inertia, position with respect to the system and the center of gravity. Subsystem for monitoring the simulation results Measuring and recording the simulation results are simulated with the simulation tracking subsystem. The simulation results are described through the torque and the angular velocity as a function of time. Analysis of the simulation model Forming a simulation model enables virtual testing of the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> and the analysis of the impact of certain parameters on the behavior of the gear during gear changes. In other words, an opportunity has been created to examine the behavior of the model while simulating different conditions. Conclusion This paper presents the modeling of the gear change process in a <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> using computers in the Matlab / Simulink environment. Computer-aided modeling of the gear change process enables the generation of different versions of virtual gear models with relevant data about their characteristics thus helping designers in their decision making in the iterative process of design, i. e. in making appropriate decisions in the early stages of design...|$|R

KAStrion goals were to maximize the production time of wind turbine farms by delivering a complete solution build upon a stand-alone analysis system which delivers a continuous on-site pre-diagnostic of the machine based on a multi-modal spectral monitoring technology. This embedded system located in the nacelle is connected to a tailored diagnostic center which delivers a periodic reporting on technical state of each machine of the farm. The strong innovation of KAStrion was to develop firstly a data-driven signal processing, referred to as AStrion, to automatically analyze, detect, classify all the spectral structures (harmonics and sidebands) of vibration signals, and secondly an original approach, referred to as SMESA, to process polyphase electrical signals.

However, the morphological and kinematic features of flying vertebrates {{are still the}} underappreciated aspects of locomotor control designs for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In this work we introduce Bat Bot, in short B 2, shown in Fig. 1 -(a), which is a biologically inspired articulated-winged micro aerial vehicle {{that is capable of}} mimicking a variety of motions and maneuvers, including but not limited to steady level flight without a conventional tail, rapid turning, inverse perching and hovering. To achieve such goals, biologic bats were examined to determine certain key morphological features of B 2. Because of the inefficiency of electric actuators compared to the biologic muscles of these mammals, certain compromises have to be made to enable B 2 for self-sustained flight. (a) B 2 (b) (c) Fig. 1 : (a) B 2, articulated-winged bat robot. (b,c) The wing articulation in bat, [2]. For a comparable performance to real bats, B 2 is designed to have a wingspan of 40 cm, and a gross weight of 60 ± 20 g, which approximately will resemble Rousettus aegyptiacus, [3]. Although real bats are reported to have more than 35 degrees of freedom (DoF) on each wing, B 2 will incorporate 3 -DoF – flapping, feathering, and extension – on each forelimb, and 2 -DoF – pitch and lead-lag – on each hindlimb. Overall mechanism with 5 -DoF per wing can flap at approximately 10 Hz and can modulate the wingspan, sweep pitch angle, and wing cambering. Turning to the actuators, B 2 has a synchronous flapping mechanism which is driven by a 5 gr brush-less motor and a 3 D-printed <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> with a 1 : 36 gear reduction ratio.

However, increased exploitation of wind power poses challenges for power network operation. The variability and uncertainty of wind power may lead to network capacity constraints, system stability issues and potential wind power curtailment in the near future. Energy storage is considered {{to be one of the}} most viable options to support the integration of increased wind power to the power network. This project is concerned with developing a hybrid wind turbine with intrinsic compressed air energy storage provision, so that the power output of a wind turbine can be controlled, thus providing flexibility. The proposed hybrid wind turbine makes use of compressed air energy storage on a turbine level. An efficient power split device in the form of a <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> is designed to couple a horizontal axis wind turbine with a scroll air expander/compressor machine, i. e. a single device that can swap its operation, and a permanent magnet synchronous generator/motor. The hybrid wind turbine can operate in conventional standalone fashion. In addition, power can be added and taken away to/from the system through the expansion and compression mode. The hybrid wind turbine also offers standalone energy storage provision, so that power can be extracted from the grid and returned at later times. The whole system mathematical model is derived and successfully validated by means of a small scale experimental test rig. Equipped with feedback control, the hybrid wind turbine can smooth the generated power output under varying wind speeds. Following this, efficiency analysis is carried out in this thesis and a feasibility study on a 1 MW hybrid wind turbine is conducted. The results obtained from the project demonstrate that the proposed hybrid wind turbine system is feasible and that it can help improve the wind turbine efficiency in addition to smoothing the power output. Therefore, it can be a valuable asset for wind power integration into the power network. ...|$|E

The [...] "AVD" [...] uses a <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> that splits the torque in the ratio 23:77 between the front axle and the driven rear axle.|$|R
5000|$|The double <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> system {{incorporates}} {{an input}} sun gear {{connected to the}} driver’s steering wheel, two <b>planetary</b> <b>gears,</b> an output sun gear connected to the steering pinion, and a rotating housing. If the housing is held still, the driver’s steer inputs are translated from the input sun <b>gear,</b> thought the <b>planetary</b> <b>gears</b> (sharing a common lay shaft) to the output sun gear with a net 1:1 ratio. I.e. if the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> housing is held still, conventional steering operation is retained. This characteristic provides a means of steering the vehicle {{in the event of}} an active steering system failure.|$|R
40|$|<b>Planetary</b> <b>gear</b> {{systems are}} very compact and {{efficiently}} transmit {{large amounts of}} power. Their advantages {{have resulted in the}} recent use of such systems on bicycles. However, since <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> systems are also complicated mechanisms with many elements, noise and vibration have been found to hamper their use. Therefore, it is desired that noise from bicycle <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> systems be reduced. Experiments to measure noise produced by a <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> system installed on a bicycle are undertaken. It is revealed that noise levels increase as gear mesh frequency increases and that the main frequency component of the sound is the natural frequency of the casing surrounding the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> system. Recommendations for reducing noise are {{to reduce the number of}} gear teeth and improve the casing of the system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Recently, {{bicycles}} {{are used}} as exercising machines and traffic vehicles. <b>Planetary</b> <b>gear</b> trains {{can be used as}} the transmission systems for bicycles. The purpose of this work is to propose a design methodology for the kinematic design of automatic <b>gear</b> transmissions with <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> trains for bicycles. First, applying the check list method (combining and extending methods), the design concepts are proposed. Then, based on the the design concepts proposed and train value equation of <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> train, we derive the gear ratio equations of automatic three-speed gear transmissions for each invention. Three automatic three-speed gear transmissions are designed to illustrate the design methodology. Based on the proposed methodology, all automatic <b>gear</b> transmissions with <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> trains can be synthesized.

40|$|A <b>Planetary</b> <b>gear</b> can {{transmit}} high torque ratio stably and, therefore, the gear {{is widely used}} in industrial applications, i. e., wind turbines, automobiles, helicopters. Unexpected failure of the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> results in substantial economic loss and human casualties. Extensive efforts {{have been made to}} develop the fault diagnostic techniques of gears; however, the techniques are mostly concerned about spur gears. This is mainly because understanding of complex dynamic behaviors of a <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> is lacking, such as multiple gear contacts, non-stationary axis of rotation, etc. This study thus proposes model-based fault diagnostics for a <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> that is based upon its dynamic analysis. Instead of vibration signals, this study uses transmission error (TE) signals for fault diagnostics of the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> because TE signals (a) are directly related to the dynamic behaviors of gear mesh stiffness and (b) increase as damages on a gear mesh reduce the gear mesh stiffness. A lumped parameter model was used for modeling dynamic behaviors of the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear.</b> For more precise modeling, mesh phase difference–between sun, ring, and planet gear – and contact ratio were taken into account in the lumped parameter model. After acquiring transmission error signals from the model, order analysis and data processing were executed to generate health related data for the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear.</b> Consequently, it is concluded that the use of transmission error signals helps gain understanding of complex dynamic behaviors of the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> and diagnose its potential faults. 1...|$|R
