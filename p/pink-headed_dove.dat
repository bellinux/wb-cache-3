60|$|In Ornithology {{there is}} a little {{uncertainty}} owing to the birds of Java and Sumatra being much better known than those of Borneo; but the ancient separation of Java as an island is well exhibited by the large number of its species which are not found in any of the other islands. It possesses no less than seven pigeons peculiar to itself, while Sumatra has only one. Of its two parrots one extends into Borneo, but neither into Sumatra. Of the fifteen species of woodpeckers inhabiting Sumatra only four reach Java, while eight of them are found in Borneo and twelve in the Malay peninsula. The two Trogons found in Java are peculiar to it, while of those inhabiting Sumatra at least two extend to Malacca and one to Borneo. There are {{a very large number of}} birds, such as the great Argus pheasant, the fire-backed and ocellated pheasants, the crested partridge (Rollulus coronatus), the small Malacca parrot (Psittinus incertus), the great helmeted hornbill (Buceroturus galeatus), the pheasant ground-cuckoo (Carpococcyx radiatus), the rose-crested bee-eater (Nyctiornis amicta), the great gaper (Corydon sumatranus), and the green-crested gaper (Calyptomena viridis), and many others, which are common to Malacca, Sumatra, and Borneo, but are entirely absent from Java. On the other hand we have the peacock, the green jungle cock, two blue ground thrushes (Arrenga cyanea and Myophonus flavirostris), the fine <b>pink-headed</b> <b>dove</b> (Ptilonopus porphyreus), three broad-tailed ground pigeons (Macropygia), and many other interesting birds, which are found nowhere in the Archipelago out of Java.|$|E

50|$|The <b>pink-headed</b> fruit <b>dove</b> is {{restricted}} to less than 12,000 km² of forest in three sites on Sumatra, sixteen on Java and one on Bali, always on forested mountains at least 2000m high. Most sites are smaller than 200 km² and shrinking. However the species is very inconspicuous {{and it is not}} yet thought to be threatened.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pink-headed</b> fruit <b>dove</b> is a {{resident}} breeding endemic bird in Indonesia where {{it occurs in}} the mountain forests of Sumatra, Java and Bali at altitudes of 1000-2200 m. It builds a flimsy nest in a tree and lays one or sometimes two white eggs which are incubated for 20 days to hatching, with a further 15-16 days to fledging. It is a shy and inconspicuous species, generally seen singly or in pairs, but flocks of up to 17 birds may form at favoured fruit trees.|$|R
50|$|These small- to {{medium-sized}} doves {{generally have}} short, fan-shaped tails, and are remarkable for their colourful and often glossy plumage, as evidenced in {{the aptly named}} orange fruit dove, flame-breasted fruit <b>dove,</b> and <b>pink-headed</b> fruit <b>dove.</b> Males and females of many fruit dove species look very different. For example, the female many-coloured fruit dove shares the male’s crimson crown and deep pink undertail feathers, but is otherwise green, whereas the male has a crimson on the upper back and has areas of yellow, olive, cinnamon, and grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of bar-necked cuckoo-doves, black cuckoo-doves, Wetar ground <b>doves,</b> <b>pink-headed</b> imperial pigeons, yellow-crested cockatoos, jonquil parrots, cinnamon-banded kingfishers, streak-breasted honeyeaters, Timor friarbirds, black-breasted myzomelas, plain gerygones, fawn-breasted whistlers, green figbirds, olive-brown orioles, Timor stubtails, buff-banded thicketbirds, Timor leaf warblers, spot-breasted heleias, orange-sided thrushes, white-bellied bush chats, black-banded flycatchers, Timor blue flycatchers, blue-cheeked flowerpeckers, flame-breasted sunbirds, tricoloured parrotfinches and Timor sparrows.|$|R
5000|$|The {{many species}} of this genus can be further grouped by {{geography}} and by certain shared characteristics. The fruit doves of the Sunda Islands and northern Australia, such as the <b>pink-headed</b> fruit <b>dove</b> and banded fruit dove, have comparatively longer tails than other species, and are notable for their solid colouration on the head, neck and breast, with a black band across the belly. Another grouping can be made of certain fruit doves endemic to New Guinea, the Moluccas, and the Bismarck Archipelago, including the carunculated fruit dove, knob-billed fruit dove, and others; these are notable for their grey colouration on the head or shoulder and/or enlarged cere (part of the bill). This group is uncharacteristically not sexually dimorphic, meaning males and females look alike. The orange dove, golden dove, and whistling dove, all endemic to Fiji and sometimes placed in their own genus Chrysoenas, have in common their small size, compact shape, yellow or orange colouration in the males, and hair-like body feathers. They also {{are known for their}} rather un-pigeon-like vocalizations, which sound like snapping, barking, or whistling, respectively. [...] Finally, the Pacific Islands provide homes to a number of species that share generally green colouration with crimson caps or crowns, ventriloquial cooing or hooting, and a distinct texture of the breast feathers. The grey-green fruit dove is typical of this group. Recent evidence suggests Ptilinopus as presently defined is paraphyletic as Alectroenas and Drepanoptila are embedded within it. The generic name Ptilinopus comes from the Ancient Greek words ptilon [...] "feather," [...] and pous, [...] "foot." ...|$|R
