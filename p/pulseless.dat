25|$|Defibrillation is the {{treatment}} of choice for ventricular fibrillation (VF) and ventricular tachycardia resulting in cardiac arrest. However, amiodarone {{has been used in}} shock-refractory VF. The 2010 guidelines of the American Heart Association included amiodarone as a second line agent (after epinephrine or vasopressin). They believed that amiodarone was more effective than lidocaine in VF or <b>pulseless</b> ventricular tachycardia.|$|E
25|$|Administration {{of oxygen}} at 15 litres per minute by face mask or bag valve mask is often sufficient, but {{tracheal}} intubation with mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Suctioning of pulmonary oedema fluid should be balanced against {{the need for}} oxygenation. The target of ventilation is to achieve 92% to 96% arterial saturation and adequate chest rise. Positive end-expiratory pressure will generally improve oxygenation. Drug administration via peripheral veins is preferred over endotracheal administration. Hypotension remaining after oxygenation may be treated by rapid crystalloid infusion. Cardiac arrest in drowning usually presents as asystole or <b>pulseless</b> electrical activity. Ventricular fibrillation {{is more likely to}} be associated with complications of pre-existing coronary artery disease, severe hypothermia, or the use of epinephrine or norepinephrine.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Weingarten of The Village Voice {{compared}} the album to Radiohead's third studio album, OK Computer, describing the record's composition as [...] "uninhibited hooks, daffy left turns, piano-soaked bathos, explorations {{of the human}} relationship with technology, [...] a complete avoidance of metal". Weingarten noted various elements and styles the band incorporated in A Thousand Suns, saying the band was [...] "sink their distortion pedals into a tender oblivion, embracing the <b>pulseless</b> Vocoder syrup of Imogen Heap, the cuddly heavenward synths of Yeasayer, the post-apocalyptic stutter-hop of El-P, the head rush of Ibiza house". Jordy Kasko of Review Rinse Repeat {{compared the}} style of A Thousand Suns to that of Pink Floyd's eighth studio album The Dark Side of the Moon and Radiohead's fourth studio album Kid A.|$|E
500|$|Egdon Heath (1927) was Holst's {{first major}} orchestral work after The Planets. Matthews summarises the music as [...] "elusive and {{unpredictable}} [...] three main elements: a <b>pulseless</b> wandering melody , a sad brass processional, and restless music for strings and oboe." [...] The mysterious dance {{towards the end}} is, says Matthews, [...] "the strangest moment in a strange work". Richard Greene in Music & Letters describes the piece as [...] "a larghetto dance in a siciliano rhythm with a simple, stepwise, rocking melody", but lacking the power of The Planets and, at times, monotonous to the listener. A more popular success was the Moorside Suite for brass band, written as a test piece for the National Brass Band Festival championships of 1928. While written within the traditions of north-country brass band music, the suite, Short says, bears Holst's unmistakable imprint, [...] "from the skipping 6/8 of the opening Scherzo, to the vigorous melodic fourths of the concluding March, the intervening Nocturne bearing a family resemblance to the slow-moving procession of Saturn".|$|E
2500|$|Osler's manoeuvre: in pseudohypertension, {{the blood}} {{pressure}} {{as measured by the}} sphygmomanometer is artificially high because of arterial wall calcification.

60|$|Sibley Junction {{is in the}} sub-tropic zone of Colorado. It lies in a hot, dry, but immensely {{productive}} valley at {{an altitude}} of some four thousand feet above the sea, a village laced with irrigating ditches, shaded by big cotton-wood-trees, and beat upon by a genial, generous-minded sun. The boarders at the Golden Eagle Hotel can sit on the front stoop and see the snow-filled ravines of the mountains to the south, and almost hear the thunder crashing round old Uncompahgre, even when the broad leaves above their heads are <b>pulseless</b> and the heat of the mid-day light is a cataract of molten metal.|$|E
60|$|Again {{the cold}} breeze set in, with a strong, steady swell, {{and with it}} was borne a low, humming note, which grew in volume and depth till it resembled the roaring rush of a November blast through the {{branches}} of an oak. It became awesome at last, with its majesty of moaning song, and saddening with its somber suggestion of autumn and of death. It opened the shabby little room upon an empty and limitless space, upon an infinite and vacant and obscure desert wherein night and storms contended. It died away at last, leaving the air chill and <b>pulseless,</b> and the chamber darker than before.|$|E

This gave them the seeming of ghostly masques, undertakers in a spectral world at the funeral of some ghost. But under it all they were men, penetrating the land of desolation and mockery and silence, puny adventurers bent on colossal adventure, pitting themselves against the might of a world as remote and alien and <b>pulseless</b> as the abysses of space.|$|E

At that imposing moment the bang of a door was heard, then the shuffle of approaching feet, and then a sort of surging and swaying disorder among the heads at the entrance from the jury-room {{told them that the}} Twelve were coming.

60|$|The radiant sky of August and September on {{the prairie}} was a never failing source of delight to me. Nature seemed resting, opulent, self-satisfied and honorable. Every phase of the {{landscape}} indicated a task fulfilled. There were still and <b>pulseless</b> days when slaty-blue clouds piled up {{in the west and}} came drifting eastward with thunderous accompaniment, to break the oppressive heat and leave the earth cool and fresh from having passed. There were misty, windy days when the sounding, southern breeze swept the yellow stubble like a scythe; when the sky, without a cloud, was whitened by an overspreading haze; when the crickets sang sleepily as if in dream of eternal summer; and the grasshoppers clicked and buzzed from stalk to stalk in pure delight of sunshine and the harvest.|$|E

In that dead, <b>pulseless</b> silence he could distinctly hear the distant voices of Levi and his companion, sounding loud and resonant in the hollow of the woods. Beyond the woods was a cornfield, and presently he heard the rattling of the harsh leaves as the two plunged into the tasseled jungle. Here, as in the woods, he followed them, step by step, guided by the noise of their progress through the canes.|$|E

60|$|As I spoke, {{my heart}} was transported, and my senses swam with {{excessive}} delight and thankfulness; I placed the head of Idris against the carriage, and, leaping out, scrambled through the snow to the cottage, whose door was open.

I returned to the carriage, and the sudden change from light to darkness at first blinded me. When I recovered my sight--eternal God of this lawless world! O supreme Death!

But the lessons which men receive as individuals, they do not learn as nations. Again and again they have seen their noblest descend into the grave, and have thought it enough to garland the tombstone when they had not crowned the brow, and to pay the honour to the ashes, which they had denied to the spirit. Let it not displease them that they are bidden, amidst the tumult and the dazzle of their busy life, to listen for the few voices, and watch for the few lamps, which God has toned and lighted to charm and to guide them, that they may not learn their sweetness by their silence, nor their light by their decay.|$|E
60|$|I {{contracted}} my view to England. The overgrown metropolis, {{the great}} heart of mighty Britain, was <b>pulseless.</b> Commerce had ceased. All resort for ambition or pleasure was cut off--the streets were grass-grown--the houses empty--the few, that from necessity remained, seemed already branded with {{the taint of}} inevitable pestilence. In the larger manufacturing towns the same tragedy was acted on a smaller, yet more disastrous scale. There was no Adrian to superintend and direct, while whole flocks of the poor were struck and killed. Yet we were not all to die. No truly, though thinned, the race of man would continue, and the great plague would, in after years, become matter of history and wonder. Doubtless this visitation was for extent unexampled--more need that we should work hard to dispute its progress; ere this men have gone out in sport, and slain their thousands and tens of thousands; but now man had become a creature of price; the life {{of one of them}} was of more worth than the so called treasures of kings. Look at his thought-endued countenance, his graceful limbs, his majestic brow, his wondrous mechanism--the type and model of this best work of God is not to be cast aside as a broken vessel--he shall be preserved, and his children and his children's children carry down the name and form of man to latest time.|$|E

Night arrived; and with its shadows a heavy discomfort. It oppressed my limbs with the oppression of some dull weight, and was palpable. There was also a moaning sound, not unlike the distant reverberation of surf, but more continuous, which, beginning with the first twilight, had grown in strength with the darkness. Suddenly lights were brought into the room, and this reverberation became forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound, but less dreary and less distinct. The ponderous oppression was in a great measure relieved; and, issuing from the flame of each lamp, (for there were many,) there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain of melodious monotone. And when now, dear Una, approaching the bed upon which I lay outstretched, you sat gently by my side, breathing odor from your sweet lips, and pressing them upon my brow, there arose tremulously within my bosom, and mingling with the merely physical sensations which circumstances had called forth, a something akin to sentiment itself--a feeling that, half appreciating, half responded to your earnest love and sorrow; but this feeling took no root in the <b>pulseless</b> heart, and seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality, and faded quickly away, first into extreme quiescence, and then into a purely sensual pleasure as before.|$|E

No, madam, we remember with advantages, as Shakspeare's Harry promised his soldiers they should do if they survived Agincourt and that day of St. Crispin. Worn old chargers turned out to grass, if the trumpet sounds over the hedge, may we not kick up our old heels, and gallop a minute or so about the paddock, till we are brought up roaring?

60|$|The {{other night}} as I sat before {{the curtain of}} the Garden Theatre and waited for it to rise upon the Hamlet of Mme. Bernhardt, a thrill of the rich {{expectation}} which cannot fail to precede the rise of any curtain upon any Hamlet passed through my eager frame. There is, indeed, no scene of drama which is of a finer horror (eighteenth-century horror) than that which opens the great tragedy. The sentry pacing up and down upon the platform at Elsinore under the winter night; the greeting {{between him and the}} comrade arriving to relieve him, with its hints of the bitter cold; the entrance of Horatio and Marcellus to these before they can part; the mention of the ghost, and, while the soldiers are in the act of protesting it a veridical phantom, the apparition of the ghost, taking the word from their lips and hushing all into a <b>pulseless</b> awe: what could be more simply and sublimely real, more naturally supernatural? What promise of high mystical things to come there is in the mere syllabling of the noble verse, and how it enlarges us from ourselves, for that time at least, to a disembodied unity with the troubled soul whose martyry seems foreboded in the solemn accents! As the many Hamlets on which the curtain had risen in my time passed in long procession through my memory, I seemed to myself so much of their world, and so little of the world that arrogantly calls itself the actual one, that I should hardly have been surprised to find myself one of the less considered persons of the drama who were seen but not heard in its course.|$|E
