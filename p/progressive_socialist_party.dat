AML-90s of the Druze <b>Progressive</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party's</b> (PSP) People’s Liberation Army (PLA) militia also swung into action against five Staghounds of the Lebanese Internal Security Forces during a raid on Fayadiyeh barracks in mid-1976. The armoured cars were incompetently handled by the leftist forces, and later abandoned near Kahale with an AMX-13 due to mechanical problems.|$|R
25|$|By mid-1985 Amal {{was also}} in {{conflict}} with the Druze <b>Progressive</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> (PSP) and its militia, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), led by Walid Jumblatt in the mountainous Chouf region. As Amal-PSP relations severely deteriorated, the Palestinian alliance with the Druze PSP began to be reestablished. Unlike the majority of other Lebanese leftist militias, the Communist Action Organization in Lebanon (OCAL), led by Muhsin Ibrahim, refused to cooperate with Syria in its attempts to vanquish Arafat which brought the wrath of the Syrians on the OCAL, forcing them to operate underground from 1987 onwards.|$|E
25|$|The Lebanese branch was {{established}} in 1966, {{the year of the}} Ba'ath Party split. During the Lebanese Civil War, the party had an armed militia called the Assad Battalion. The party joined forces with Kamal Jumblatt's <b>Progressive</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> in organizing the National Democratic Movement, seeking to abolish the confessional state. The National Democratic Movement was superseded by the National Democratic Front, in which the party participated. The party organized resistance against Israeli forces in Lebanon. In July 1987 it took part in forming the Unification and Liberation Front.|$|E

25|$|In March {{the same}} year, Lebanese National Movement leader Kamal Jumblatt was assassinated. The murder was widely {{blamed on the}} Syrian government. While Jumblatt's role {{as leader of the}} Druze <b>Progressive</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> was filled {{surprisingly}} smoothly by his son, Walid Jumblatt, the LNM disintegrated after his death. Although the anti-government pact of leftists, Shi'a, Sunni, Palestinians and Druze would stick together for some time more, their wildly divergent interests tore at opposition unity. Sensing the opportunity, Hafez al-Assad immediately began splitting up both the Maronite and Muslim coalitions in a game of divide and conquer.|$|E
25|$|On 17 March 1949, Kamal Jumblatt officially {{founded the}} <b>Progressive</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> (PSP) and {{declared}} its constitution on 1 May 1949. The PSP was a socialist party espousing secularism and officially {{opposed to the}} sectarian character of Lebanese politics. In practice, it has been led and largely supported since its foundation {{by members of the}} Druze community in general, and the Jumblatt clan in particular. In the name of the PSP, Jumblatt called the first convention of the Arab Socialist Parties, was held in Beirut in May 1951. In the same year, he was reelected for the third time as Deputy of Mount Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|The small Druze sect, {{strategically}} and dangerously {{seated on}} the Chouf in central Lebanon, had no natural allies, and so were compelled to put much effort into building alliances. Under {{the leadership of the}} Jumblatt family, first Kamal Jumblatt (the LNM leader) and then his son Walid, the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> (PSP) (Arabic: الحزب التقدمي الاشتراكي, al-hizb al-taqadummi al-ishtiraki) served as an effective Druze militia, building excellent ties to the Soviet Union mainly, and with Syria upon the withdrawal of Israel to the south of the country. However, many Druze in Lebanon at the time were members of the non-religious party, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party. Under Kamal Jumblatt's leadership, the PSP was a major element in the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) which supported Lebanon's Arab identity and sympathized with the Palestinians. It built a powerful private army, which proved {{to be one of the}} strongest in the Lebanese Civil War of 1975 to 1990. It conquered much of Mount Lebanon and the Chouf District. Its main adversaries were the Maronite Christian Phalangist militia, and later the Lebanese Forces militia (which absorbed the Phalangists). The PSP suffered a major setback in 1977, when Kamal Jumblatt was assassinated. His son Walid succeeded him as leader of the party.|$|E
50|$|In many {{developed}} nations {{the adoption of}} Third Way policies by social democratic parties {{has led to the}} rise of many new <b>socialist</b> <b>parties</b> running on solid left-wing agendas.

50|$|The {{two main}} {{candidates}} were {{neck and neck}} in the first-round vote held on 31 October 2004, winning 39.32% (Yanukovych) and 39.87% (Yushchenko) of the vote casts. The candidates who came third and fourth collected much less: Oleksandr Moroz of the <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> of Ukraine and Petro Symonenko of the Communist Party of Ukraine received 5.82% and 4.97%, respectively. Since no candidate had won more than 50% of the cast ballots, Ukrainian law mandated a run-off vote between two leading candidates. After {{the announcement of the}} run-off, Oleksandr Moroz threw his support behind Viktor Yushchenko. The <b>Progressive</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party's</b> Natalia Vitrenko, who won 1.53% of the vote, endorsed Yanukovych, who hoped for Petro Simonenko's endorsement but did not receive it.|$|R
500|$|The {{leaders of}} the March 14 {{alliance}} and other prominent Lebanese figures called on Hezbollah to end its involvement in Syria and said it is putting Lebanon at risk. Subhi al-Tufayli, Hezbollah's former leader, said [...] "Hezbollah should not be defending the criminal regime that kills its own people and that has never fired a shot {{in defense of the}} Palestinians". He said [...] "those Hezbollah fighters who are killing children and terrorizing people and destroying houses in Syria will go to hell". The Consultative Gathering, a group of Shia and Sunni leaders in Baalbek-Hermel, also called on Hezbollah not to [...] "interfere" [...] in Syria. They said, [...] "Opening a front against the Syrian people and dragging Lebanon to war with the Syrian people is very dangerous and will {{have a negative impact on}} the relations between the two". Walid Jumblatt, leader of the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party,</b> also called on Hezbollah to end its involvement and claimed that [...] "Hezbollah is fighting inside Syria with orders from Iran". Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi condemned Hezbollah by saying, [...] "We stand against Hezbollah in its aggression against the Syrian people. There is no space or place for Hezbollah in Syria".|$|E

50|$|The town {{itself was}} the scene of several notable fierce battles during the Lebanese Civil War, its notability arising from being {{actually}} held for a long time by the Lebanese Army rather than a particular Lebanese militia. This was sometimes achieved against great odds, by facing strong pressure from Lebanese Muslim militias backed both by Syrian Army forces stationed at Lebanon and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) guerrilla factions. Between September 1983 and October 1990, General Michel Aoun's Eighth Brigade managed to repulse the Druze <b>Progressive</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party's</b> People's Liberation Army (PLA) militia and their allies' attempts to wrestle control of the town. Unfortunately for the local civilian population, it also led to the destruction of much of their town.|$|R

2500|$|Nasrallah {{also came}} under intense {{criticism}} from some in Lebanon. Walid Jumblatt, {{leader of the}} <b>Progressive</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> of the Republic of Lebanon and the most prominent leader of the Druze community, spoke out quite forcefully: [...] "Great, so he's a hero. But I'd like to challenge this heroism of his. I {{have the right to}} challenge it, because my country is in flames. Besides, we did not agree..." [...] Jumblatt is also quoted as saying: [...] "He is willing to let the Lebanese capital burn while he haggles over terms of surrender." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 23, Walid Jamblatt, {{leader of}} the {{predominantly}} Druze <b>Progressive</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> (PSP), announced {{the formation of a}} Syrian-backed [...] "National Salvation Front" [...] opposed to the May 17 Agreement. In anticipation of an IDF withdrawal from the Alayh and Shuf districts, fighting between the Druze and LF and between the Druze and LAF, intensified during the month of August.

The LAF also clashed with the Amal militia in Beirut's western and southern suburbs.|$|E
5000|$|Social fascism was {{a theory}} {{supported}} by the Communist International (Comintern) during the early 1930s, which held that social democracy was a variant of fascism because, {{in addition to a}} shared corporatist economic model, it stood {{in the way of a}} dictatorship of the proletariat. At the time, the leaders of the Comintern, such as Joseph Stalin and Rajani Palme Dutt, argued that capitalist society had entered the [...] "Third Period" [...] in which a working class revolution was imminent, but could be prevented by social democrats and other [...] "fascist" [...] forces.
