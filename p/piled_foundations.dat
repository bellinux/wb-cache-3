They provided efficient means for the overland movement of armies, officials, and civilians, and the inland carriage of official communications and trade goods. Roman roads were of several kinds, ranging from small local roads to broad, long-distance highways built to connect cities, major towns and military bases. These major roads were often stone-paved and metaled, cambered for drainage, and were flanked by footpaths, bridleways and drainage ditches. They were laid along accurately surveyed courses, and some were cut through hills, or conducted over rivers and ravines on bridgework.

30|$|A {{renewable}} {{energy storage system}} is being proposed through a multi-disciplinary research project. This system utilizes reinforced concrete <b>pile</b> <b>foundations</b> to store {{renewable energy}} generated from solar panels attached to building structures. The renewable energy {{can be stored in}} the form of compressed air inside the <b>pile</b> <b>foundation</b> with a hollowed section. The <b>pile</b> <b>foundation</b> should resist complex combined actions including structural loads, soil effects, and pressures induced from the compressed air, and thus it requires a careful analysis and design considerations to secure a sufficient structural safety. This paper presents analytical investigation results on the structural responses of the energy piles under these combined loadings. The <b>pile</b> <b>foundations</b> were designed based on the current design practices for various building geometries including the number of stories and column spacing. The magnitude of air pressure was determined from the thermodynamic cycles for the available renewable energy for storage considering building and <b>pile</b> <b>foundation</b> geometries. Finite element analyses were conducted using an elastic 3 D model to determine critical tensile stresses of the <b>pile</b> <b>foundation.</b> These critical tensile stresses were used to identify required reinforcement in the pile section.

50|$|The Bolivar Peninsula {{was just}} {{to the right of}} landfall, placing it on the strong side of the hurricane. H Wind reconstructions (Powell et al., 1998) show winds blowing {{strongly}} from offshore-to-onshore for most of the storm, which acted to increase both surge and waves. Surge is extremely important for the particular case of the Bolivar Peninsula, as it allowed large waves to penetrate inland into areas they could not otherwise have reached. Shoreline erosion was around 75 m, which undermined the <b>piled</b> <b>foundations</b> of oceanfront buildings. Most other houses in this area were reduced to either piles or slabs by large waves riding on surge, with only a very few remaining more or less intact. Peak coastal surges reached 21 ft. Water depths of at least 5 ft covered all of the Bolivar Peninsula, with most areas covered by at least 15 ft of water (not including wave action). Much of the southern part of Chambers County was also inundated by at least 12 ft of water. According to post-storm analyses by both the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Hurricane Research Division and Applied Research Associates (ARA), a research and engineering company, the best estimates of 3-second peak wind gusts along the eastern portion of the peninsula were between 110 mph and 115 mph. Research observations also suggest most of eastern and southeastern Texas was subjected to tropical storm and hurricane-force winds for ten hours, and possibly longer.|$|E
5000|$|A {{part of the}} James A. Roberts {{design for}} the {{original}} Bull Ring Shopping Centre included a 12 storey circular office block. This was revised to 25 storeys, abandoning plans for a rooftop restaurant and a cinema. The design was approved and construction began on the 81 metre (265 ft) building in 1961. It was constructed with aid of a tower crane located {{to the side of}} the reinforced concrete central core. Due to its proximity to a railway tunnel, the main load was built on to a twin ring of <b>piled</b> <b>foundations</b> directly beneath the circular structural core. The floors are supported by the core and perimeter columns. When opened, the podium had shops and its own work of art, [...] "The Rotunda Relief" [...] at Lloyds banking hall, a circular mural designed by John Poole. [...] The building construction was unique at the time, possibly due to the lack of construction space, and was mostly built at ground floor level then 'jacked up' one floor at a time. This allowed the plant room and boiler house, located on the top floor, to have their equipment installed at ground level, making access easier than having to crane the equipment once the building was complete. The supports for the hydraulic pumps used to jack up the building started to shift towards the New Street Station railway lines so the building's planned height was never completed.Completed in 1965 as an office block at a cost of £1 million during the post-war rebuilding of the Bull Ring, it was initially much derided and considered a [...] "dead building". However, suggestions in the 1980s that it should be demolished when the Bull Ring was again redeveloped met with equal, if not greater, hostility from the local populace.|$|E
