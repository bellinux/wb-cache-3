40|$|The first {{measurements}} of <b>pernitric</b> <b>acid</b> at the South Pole were performed {{during the second}} Investigation of Sulfur Chemistry in the Antarctic Troposphere (ISCAT 2000). Observed HO 2 NO 2 concentrations averaged 25 pptv. Simple steady-state calculations constrained by measurements show that the lifetime of <b>pernitric</b> <b>acid</b> was largely controlled by dry deposition, with thermal decomposition becoming increasingly important at warmer temperatures. We determined that the <b>pernitric</b> <b>acid</b> equilibrium constant is less uncertain than indicated in the literature. One consequence of <b>pernitric</b> <b>acid</b> deposition to the snow surface {{is that it is}} an important sink for both NOx and HOx. Another is that the photochemistry of HO 2 NO 2 in the Antarctic snowpack may be a NOx source in addition to nitrate photolysis. This might be one of the important differences in snow photochemistry between the South Pole and warmer polar sites...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{multiphase}} chemistry model {{coupled with}} a quasi-spectral microphysical model {{has been applied to}} measurements from the European Cloud Ice Mountain Experiment campaign to quantify the formation of the strong acids nitrate and sulfate and to evaluate the role of microphysical processes in redistributing reactive species among the different phases (gas versus cloud and/or rain). Significant formation of nitrate and sulfate are found to be due to the reaction of <b>pernitric</b> <b>acid</b> with the sulfite ion. Moreover, <b>pernitric</b> <b>acid,</b> because of its equilibrium in the gas phase and its high solubility, is always available both in cloud water and in rainwater via mass transfer from the gas phase. The sulfite ion comes from the mass transfer from the gas phase of sulfur dioxide in cloud water. When rain formation begins, it is efficiently transferred to the rainwater by collision/coalescence processes. This leads to an enhancement in strong acid production when microphysics is activated in the model. Modeled results have been compared with experimental data in an effort to retrieve a behavior law related to the partitioning between the gas and aqueous phases of the cloud. In particular, when collision/coalescence processes are considered, an improvement in retrieving the partitioning of soluble species and especially nitrate is observed. A higher production in sulfate could help interpret the discrepancy of global model calculations with observed sulfate concentrations in Europe in wintertime...|$|E
40|$|The {{photodissociation}} of <b>pernitric</b> <b>acid</b> (PNA) was {{studied at}} 248 nm. The quantum yield for production of OH radicals is 34 + or - 16 percent. The yield of OH from PNA was measured relative {{to that of}} H 2 O 2. The translational and rotational energy content of the OH photofragment from PNA was characterized. A fluorescent emission was also observed and characterized. It is attributed to electronically excited NO 2 produced in the PNA photodissociation. A maximum yield of 30 percent for NO 2 production was determined. The intensity of this emission, and a mass spectrometric peak at m/e = 33, {{were found to be}} useful means of characterizing the purity of the PNA sample...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMeasurements of the C-H {{overtone}} transition strengths {{combined with}} {{estimates of the}} photodissociation cross sections for these transitions suggest that near-IR photodissociation of peroxy acetyl nitrate (PAN) is less significant (J near-IR ? 3 × 10 ? 8 s ? 1 at noon) in the lower atmosphere than competing sinks resulting from unimolecular decomposition and ultraviolet photolysis. This {{is in contrast to}} the photochemical behavior of a related peroxy nitrate, <b>pernitric</b> <b>acid</b> (PNA), that undergoes rapid near-IR photolysis in the atmosphere with J near-IR ? 10 ? 5 s ? 1 at noon (Roehl et al., 2002). This difference is attributed to the larger binding energy and larger number of vibrational degrees of freedom in PAN, which make 4 ? CH the lowest overtone excitation with a high photodissociation yield (as opposed to 2 ? OH in PNA) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{geometries}} {{of transition}} states and adducts have been optimized in MP 2 / 6 - 311 ++G** calculations {{on both the}} singlet and triplet potential energy surfaces for the reaction of NO 3 with OH. Single point calculations have been made at the G 2 MP 2 level. Reaction is shown to be most likely to occur on the singlet surface via an adduct whose structure {{is very similar to}} that of <b>pernitric</b> <b>acid,</b> HO 2 NO 2. The formation of the adduct is exothermic, and the calculated enthalpy of activation is - 8 kJ mol(- 1). This adduct can dissociate to HO 2 + NO 2 directly or via rotational isomers. Reaction on the triplet surface is unlikely to be important because the formation of a triplet adduct has a large enthalpy of activation...|$|E
40|$|Methyl peroxy nitrate (CH 3 O 2 NO 2) is a non-acyl peroxy nitrate that is {{important}} for photochemistry at low temperatures characteristic of the upper troposphere. We report the first measurements of CH 3 O 2 NO 2, which we achieved through a new aircraft inlet configuration, combined with thermal-dissociation laser-induced fluorescence (TD-LIF) detection of NO 2, and describe the accuracy, specificity, and interferences to CH 3 O 2 NO 2 measurements. CH 3 O 2 NO 2 is predicted to be a ubiquitous interference to upper-tropospheric NO 2 measurements. We describe an experimental strategy for obtaining NO 2 observations free of the CH 3 O 2 NO 2 interference. Using these new methods, we made observations during two recent aircraft campaigns: the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC- 3) and the Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds, and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC 4 RS) experiments. The CH 3 O 2 NO 2 measurements we report have a detection limit (S/N = 2) of 15 pptv at 1 min averaging on a background of 200 pptv NO 2 and an accuracy of ± 40 %. Observations are used to constrain the interference of <b>pernitric</b> <b>acid</b> (HO 2 NO 2) to the CH 3 O 2 NO 2 measurements, as HO 2 NO 2 partially decomposes (~ 11 %) along with CH 3 O 2 NO 2 in the heated CH 3 O 2 NO 2 channel used to detect CH 3 O 2 NO 2...|$|E
40|$|Recent field {{campaigns have}} {{measured}} enhanced levels of NOx (NO+NO 2) and HOx precursors (i. e., H 2 O 2, CH 2 O, and HONO) {{that can not}} be accounted for by gas phase chemistry alone. Snowpack emission is now considered a source of these species. Therefore, the photochemistry in the polar boundary layer is now believed to be much more complex than initially thought. 	Field campaigns to Summit, Greenland in the summer of 2003 and the spring of 2004 have obtained the first measurements of peroxy (HO 2 +RO 2) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals in the Artic boundary layer. Measurements were collected with a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS). A highly constrained (ie., O 3, H 2 O, CH 4, CO, j-values, NO, H 2 O 2,CH 2 O, and HONO) 0 -D steady-state model was employed in order to test our current understanding of photochemistry. HO 2 +RO 2 measurements were in excellent agreement with model predictions for both spring and summer. OH measurements were in good agreement with spring model predictions but were a factor of two greater than summer model predictions. The role of snowpack emission is also addressed in a HOx budget performed on the spring campaign. Measurements of nitric acid (HNO 3) and <b>pernitric</b> <b>acid</b> (HO 2 NO 2) were obtained with the CIMS during the Antarctic Tropospheric Chemistry Investigation (ANTCI). The linkage between HOx and NOx chemistry is examined through partitioning of reactive nitrogen between HNO 3 and HO 2 NO 2. The possible impact of reactive nitrogen partitioning on nitrate ions (NO 3 -) at coring sites is also investigated. Ph. D.

40|$|Mixing {{ratios of}} the {{atmospheric}} nitrogen oxides NO and NO 2 were measured {{as part of}} the OPALE (Oxidant Production in Antarctic Lands & Export) campaign at Dome C, East Antarctica (75. 1 ° S, 123. 3 ° E, 3233 m), during December 2011 to January 2012. Profiles of NO x mixing ratios of the lower 100 m of the atmosphere confirm that, in contrast to South Pole, air chemistry at Dome C is dominated by strong diurnal cycles in solar irradiance and atmospheric stability. Depth profiles of mixing ratios in firn air suggest that the upper snowpack at Dome C holds a significant reservoir of photolytically produced NO 2 and is a sink of gas phase ozone (O 3). First-time observations of BrO at Dome C suggest 2 – 3 pptv near the ground, with higher levels in the free troposphere. Assuming steady-state, observed mixing ratios of BrO and RO 2 radicals are too low to explain the large NO 2 : NO ratios found in ambient air. A previously not considered interference with <b>pernitric</b> <b>acid</b> (HNO 4) may explain part of this inconsistency. During 2011 – 2012 NO x mixing ratios and flux were larger than in 2009 – 2010 consistent with also larger surface O 3 mixing ratios resulting from increased net O 3 production. Large NO x mixing ratios arose from a combination of changes in mixing height and NO x snow emission flux F NO x. During 23 December 2011 – 12 January 2012 median F NO x was twice that during the same period in 2009 – 2010 due to significantly larger atmospheric turbulence and a slightly stronger snowpack source. A tripling of F NO x in December 2011 was largely due to changes in snow pack source strength caused primarily by changes in NO 3 − concentrations in the snow skin layer, and only to a secondary order by decrease of total column O 3 and associated increase in NO 3 − photolysis rates. Systematic changes in the quantum yield of NO 3 − photolysis over time may contribute to the observed F NO x variability...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen oxides (NOx ≡ NO + NO 2) {{regulate}} {{tropospheric ozone}} (O 3) production rates. In the upper troposphere (~ 8 – 15 km above ground level), where O 3 {{is an important}} greenhouse gas, there are few detailed measurements of NOx and its oxidation products. As a result, the chemical reactions that involve NOx are poorly characterized under the low temperature conditions in this region of the atmosphere. For the reactions that have been studied under these conditions (e. g., daytime nitric acid, or HNO 3, and <b>pernitric</b> <b>acid,</b> or HO 2 NO 2, production), the results from various experiments indicate a 20 – 50 % disagreement for the rate constants, and the other important NOx oxidation reactions (production of acyl peroxy nitrate, like PAN and PPN, and alkyl and multifunctional nitrates) have not been well characterized for the conditions characteristic of the upper troposphere. Besides the poorly understood NOx oxidation rates, recent calculations have indicated {{there is an important}} upper tropospheric NOx oxidation product (methyl peroxy nitrate, or CH 3 O 2 NO 2) that has not been measured in the atmosphere. These uncertainties in the products and oxidation rate constants affect the characterization of the input of NOx from lightning. In this dissertation, I report observations obtained during two airborne field campaigns, the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC 3, May – June, 2012) and the Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds, and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC 4 RS, August – September, 2013) experiments, and use these observations to investigate the reaction products and rate constants for the oxidation of NOx to less reactive reservoirs. The observations focused on fresh lightning emissions in deep convective outflow, and the subsequent chemical aging of the outflow downwind. First, I present the first ambient observations of CH 3 O 2 NO 2, and recommendations on how to measure upper tropospheric in situ NO 2 with minimal interferences from the thermal decomposition of CH 3 O 2 NO 2 during sampling. I show that CH 3 O 2 NO 2 is ubiquitous in the upper troposphere and is as important NOx oxidative product as HNO 3. Then, using observations from one quasi-Lagrangian flight during DC 3, I derive constraints on the daytime NOx oxidative rate constants for the reactions that remove upper tropospheric NOx. The reactions include the production of CH 3 O 2 NO 2, HO 2 NO 2, PAN, PPN, alkyl and multifunctional nitrates, and HNO 3. These constraints indicate that NOx lifetime is longer than currently believe due to the daytime HNO 3 and HO 2 NO 2 production rate constants being 30 – 50 % slower than currently assumed. Finally, the implications of the longer lifetime are used to show that lightning NOx emission rates are at least 33 % larger than current estimates. As a consequence, model predictions indicate O 3 in the upper troposphere increase by 5 – 10 % with a resulting increase in radiative forcing...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{of decades}} of research, the {{formation}} mechanism of daytime HONO {{is still not}} fully understood and {{little is known about}} the daytime behavior of HONO over soil and snow surfaces in polluted rural areas. HONO measurements in two regions heavily affected by oil and gas drilling activities (in Wyoming and Utah) show high levels of daytime HONO (above 500 pptv) during the wintertime. However, questions were raised about the reliability of wintertime HONO observations as recent studies show that many in-situ HONO measurement methods suffer from <b>pernitric</b> <b>acid</b> (PNA) interferences that overestimate HONO concentrations. The UCLA Long-Path (LP) Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) instrument measured HONO and HONO gradients in the Uintah Basin (UB), a region highly impacted by oil and gas activities. The UCLA LP-DOAS system measured HONO on three light paths covering height intervals from 2 m to 31, 45, and 68 m above ground level (agl). Due to disparate meteorological conditions in 2012 and 2014, HONO was measured over soil in 2012 and over snow in 2014. HONO mixing ratios averaged 74 ppt in 2012. These levels are lower than HONO measured in polluted urban areas but comparable to levels measured in rural environments. Distinct daytime negative vertical gradients of HONO were observed in 2012, with higher levels of HONO measured on the lower than upper light paths, an indication that HONO had a surface source in 2012. HONO vertical profiles were retrieved using a novel least square minimization approach, in which the average mixing ratios of HONO along the light paths were simulated using a height dependent exponential function. The HONO vertical profiles, together with NOAA micrometeorological data were used to calculate HONO fluxes at 19 m agl. Sunny days hourly average HONO fluxes show that they follow the same trend as solar irradiance, with a maximum of (1. 7 ï¿½ 0. 3) x 1010 molec. cm- 2 s- 1 at noontime, supporting the idea of a photolytic surface HONO source in 2012. Analysis of HONO flux and photolytic surface HONO sources show that under conditions of high NO 2 levels, conversion of NO 2 on ground surfaces is most likely the source of daytime HONO. In contrast, on days with moderate NO 2 levels, photolysis of surface-adsorbed HNO 3 and nocturnal uptake of HONO followed by daytime acid displacement might play an important role; however, additional measurements are needed to confirm this theory. Comparison of the missing source of HONO (Punknwon) and HONO surface flux rate shows that the HONO surface flux rate accounts for (63 ï¿½ 32 %) of the Punknown throughout the day indicating that photolytic surface sources of HONO were the dominant sources of HONO in 2012. HONO mixing ratios measured in 2014 were on average 96 ppt. Comparison of DOAS HONO measurements with four in-situ instruments shows that the DOAS system consistently measured the lowest HONO levels. Preliminary analysis of PNA interferences shows that some in-situ measurements might overestimate HONO concentrations in the presence of PNA (average maximum concentration of 120 ppt measured around noontime), therefore, HONO DOAS were considered the reference measurements in the 2014 study. 2014 HONO vertical profiles also show higher HONO mixing ratios near the surface and a rapid decay of HONO mixing ratios with height. The sunny days hourly average HONO fluxes were also positive with a maximum HONO flux near noontime of (1. 1 ï¿½ 0. 7) x 1010 molec. cm- 2 s- 1. The sunny days hourly average HONO fluxes also follow a similar temporal trend as solar irradiance, further supporting the hypothesis of a photolytic surface HONO source in 2014. Due to insufficient data, we were not able to determine which photolytic surface HONO formation pathway dominated in 2014. However, we were able to determine that the measured 2014 HONO was most probably formed at the top of the snowpack and not in the firn. This result is supported by the surprisingly similar HONO fluxes measured in 2012 and 2014, which indicate that the HONO formation mechanisms during these two years were probably very similar. Comparison of the missing source of HONO (Punknwon) and HONO surface flux rate shows that HONO surface flux rate accounts for (54 ï¿½% 15) of the Punknown in the early morning and noontime, suggesting that HONO sources at noon and early morning are light dependent and are produced on the snow surface...|$|E
