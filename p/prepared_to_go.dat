5|$|An origin myth {{from the}} Murri people of Queensland, cited by Andrew Lang, {{describes}} how the Australian pelican acquired its black and white plumage. The pelican, formerly a black bird, made a canoe during a flood {{in order to save}} drowning people. He {{fell in love with a}} woman he thus saved, but she and her friends tricked him and escaped. The pelican consequently <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to war against them by daubing himself with white clay as war paint. However, before he had finished, another pelican, on seeing such a strange piebald creature, killed him with its beak, and all such pelicans have been black and white ever since.|$|E
5|$|The Students' Observatory was {{constructed}} in 1886 on the Berkeley campus, with the original funds provided by the California legislature {{in order for the}} observatory to provide practical training to civil engineers. Very quickly, the Students' Observatory became seen as a training ground for students studying astronomy, so that they would be better <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on to use the facilities at Lick Observatory. This contributed to the separation of the departments of civil engineering and astronomy in the mid-1890s, with the Students' Observatory becoming the home of the Berkeley Astronomy Department.|$|E
5|$|During {{a cabinet}} meeting {{towards the end}} of April, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi asked Manekshaw if he was <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to war with Pakistan. In response, Manekshaw told her most of his {{armoured}} and infantry divisions were deployed elsewhere, only 12 of his tanks were combat-ready, and they would be competing for rail carriages with the grain harvest at that point of time. He also pointed out the Himalayan passes would soon open up, with the forthcoming monsoon in East Pakistan, which would result in heavy flooding. When Gandhi asked the cabinet to leave the room and Manekshaw to stay, he offered to resign. She declined to accept it, but sought his advice. He then said he could guarantee victory if she would allow him to prepare for the conflict on his terms, and set a date for it, and Gandhi agreed.|$|E

5|$|The {{reversal}} of course {{brought her back}} in range of the British battlecruisers, however, which quickly opened fire and scored several damaging hits. The order to abandon ship was given, and men began gathering on the deck. Engineers set scuttling charges while the men topside <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the water. At 14:25, the ship rolled over and sank. The survivors expected the British to pick them up, but they instead departed. German ships searched the area three days later, to find only one survivor, Leading Stoker Neumann; {{the rest of the}} crew had died in the water. The wreck was moved in August 1979 to render it less of an underwater hazard. Some parts of the ship were salvaged and are now preserved in the Cuxhaven Shipwreck Museum.|$|E

25|$|Undoubtedly {{the lack}} of oxygen and the calorie-restricted, nutrient-dense diet contributed to low morale.

25|$|Konoe {{made one}} more {{desperate attempt to}} avert war. He {{proposed}} a personal summit with Roosevelt–in the United States if necessary–to come to some understanding.

25|$|But Carter's choice {{had only}} just been made when Ronald Reagan won the {{presidency}} and set about re-examining the MX plans. In October 1981 they announced MX deployment would be sped up, cancelling the MPS basing and recommending the missiles temporarily be placed in existing Titan II and Minuteman silos until a final solution could be decided on. Work on LoADS continued, in and June 1982 was renamed Sentry. The program was told to be <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into production on short notice.|$|E

25|$|Unlike other Eastern Bloc countries, the Socialist Republic of Romania {{had never}} {{undergone}} even limited de-Stalinization. In November 1989, Ceauşescu, then aged 71, was re-elected {{for another five}} years {{as leader of the}} Romanian Communist Party, signaling that he intended to ride out the anti-Communist uprisings sweeping the rest of Eastern Europe. As Ceauşescu <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on a state visit to Iran, on December 16, 1989, his Securitate ordered the arrest and exile of a local Hungarian-speaking Calvinist minister, László Tőkés, for sermons offending the regime.|$|E

25|$|Late in 1915, 201st Brigade {{moved to}} Sevenoaks, later camping at Barham. The 67th Division had dual {{responsibility}} {{as part of}} the mobile force for Home Defence, and to train drafts for overseas service. Twice it was ordered to prepare for service in Ireland, and in April 1917 it <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to France. However, nothing came of these deployments, and the division was drained of its manpower as its men were drafted to frontline units. The 2/9th Middlesex was disbanded in November 1917.|$|E
25|$|After Trudeau's Liberals {{upgraded}} their minority {{government to}} {{a majority in}} the 1974 federal election, they had more leeway to act on abolishing the capital punishment in Canada. In 1973, Liberals had renewed the provisions of Bill C-168, passed by Lester B. Pearson's minority government in 1968, which imposed a five-year moratorium {{on the use of the}} death penalty. With a majority behind them, Allmand and Trudeau, both ardent abolitionists, <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> further than Pearson had gone and decided to try and abolish the death penalty altogether.|$|E
25|$|After having {{suppressed}} the Braşov Rebellion in 1987, Nicolae Ceauşescu was re-elected {{for another five}} years {{as leader of the}} Romanian Communist Party (PCR) in November 1989, signalling that he intended to ride out the anti-Communist uprisings sweeping the rest of Europe. As Ceauşescu <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on a state visit to Iran, his Securitate ordered the arrest and exile of a local Hungarian Calvinist minister, László Tőkés, on 16 December, for sermons offending the regime.
