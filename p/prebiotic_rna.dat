40|$|Life originated, {{according}} to the RNA World hypothesis, from self-replicating ribozymes that catalyzed ligation of RNA fragments. We have solved the 2. 6 angstrom crystal structure of a ligase ribozyme that catalyzes regiospecific formation of a 5 ' to 3 ' phosphodiester bond between the 5 '-triphosphate and the 3 '-hydroxyl termini of two RNA fragments. Invariant residues form tertiary contacts that stabilize a flexible stem of the ribozyme at the ligation site, where an essential magnesium ion coordinates three phosphates. The structure of the active site permits us to suggest how transition-state stabilization and a general base may catalyze the ligation reaction required for <b>prebiotic</b> <b>RNA</b> assembly...|$|E

40|$|The {{recently}} identified glmS ribozyme {{revealed that}} RNA enzymes, like protein enzymes, {{are capable of}} using small molecules as catalytic cofactors to promote chemical reactions. Flavin mononucleotide (FMN), S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), adenosyl cobalamin (AdoCbl), and thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) are known ligands for RNA riboswitches in the control of gene expression, but are also catalytically powerful and ubiquitous cofactors in protein enzymes. If RNA, instead of just binding these molecules, could harness the chemical potential of the cofactor, it would significantly expand the enzymatic repertoire of ribozymes. Here we review the chemistry of AdoCbl, SAM, FMN, and TPP in protein enzymology and speculate on how these cofactors might {{have been used by}} ribozymes in the <b>prebiotic</b> <b>RNA</b> World or may still find application in modern biology...|$|E
40|$|This review {{summarizes}} {{our recent}} {{findings on the}} role of mineral salts in <b>prebiotic</b> <b>RNA</b> synthesis, which is catalyzed by montmorillonite clay minerals. The clay minerals not only catalyze the synthesis of RNA but also facilitate homochiral selection. Preliminary data of these findings have been presented at the “Horizontal Gene Transfer and the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) ” conference at the Open University, Milton Keynes, UK, 5 – 6 September 2013. The objective of this meeting was to recognize the significance of RNA in LUCA. We believe that the <b>prebiotic</b> <b>RNA</b> synthesis from its monomers must have been a simple process. As a first step, it may have required activation of the 5 '-end of the mononucleotide with a leaving group, e. g., imidazole in our model reaction (Figure 1). Wide ranges of activating groups are produced from HCN under plausible prebiotic Earth conditions. The final step is clay mineral catalysis in the presence of mineral salts to facilitate selective production of functional RNA. Both the clay minerals and mineral salts would have been abundant on early Earth. We have demonstrated that while montmorillonite (pH 7) produced only dimers from its monomers in water, addition of sodium chloride (1 M) enhanced the chain length multifold, as detected by HPLC. The effect of monovalent cations on RNA synthesis was of the following order: Li+ > Na+ > K+. A similar effect was observed with the anions, enhancing catalysis in the following order: Cl− > Br− > I−. The montmorillonite-catalyzed RNA synthesis was not affected by hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions. We thus show that prebiotic synthesis of RNA from its monomers was a simple process requiring only clay minerals and a small amount of salt...|$|E
40|$|The RNA World Hypothesis {{posits that}} the first {{self-replicating}} molecules were RNAs. RNA self-replicases are, in general, assumed to have employed nucleotide 5 '-polyphosphates (or their analogues) as substrates for RNA polymerization. The mechanism by which these substrates might be synthesized with sufficient abundance to supply a growing and evolving population of RNAs is problematic for evolutionary hypotheses because non-enzymatic synthesis and assembly of nucleotide 5 '-triphosphates (or other analogously activated phosphodiester species) is inherently difficult. However, nucleotide 2 ', 3 '-cyclic phosphates are also phosphodiesters, and are the natural and abundant products of RNA degradation. These have previously been dismissed as viable substrates for <b>prebiotic</b> <b>RNA</b> synthesis. We propose that the arguments for their dismissal {{are based on a}} flawed assumption, and that nucleotide 2 ', 3 '-cyclic phosphates in fact possess several significant, advantageous properties that indeed make them particularly viable substrates for <b>prebiotic</b> <b>RNA</b> synthesis. An RNA World hypothesis based upon the polymerization of nucleotide 2 ', 3 '-cyclic phosphates possesses additional explanatory power in that it accounts for the observed ribozyme "fossil record", suggests a viable mechanism for substrate transport across lipid vesicle boundaries of primordial proto-cells, circumvents the problems of substrate scarcity and implausible synthetic pathways, provides for a primitive but effective RNA replicase editing mechanism, and definitively explains why RNA, rather than DNA, must have been the original catalyst. Finally, our analysis compels us to propose that a fundamental and universal property that drives the evolution of living systems, as well as pre-biotic replicating molecules (be they composed of RNA or protein), is that they exploit chemical reactions that already possess competing kinetically-preferred and thermodynamically-preferred pathways in a manner that optimizes the balance between the two types of pathways. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland...|$|E

Rock surfaces can facilitate the folding of amino acid chains having polar and hydrophobic residues, with an accompanying heat loss to the surrounding rock. These chains then absorb heat from the soup as they unfold.

40|$|The RNA World {{hypothesis}} suggests <b>prebiotic</b> enzymes were <b>RNA</b> molecules (ribozymes) {{rather than}} proteins. Previously, in vitro selection identified a ribozyme that synthesized the glycosidic bond in a pyrimidine nucleotide.

In preparation for two new selections for purine and pyridine nucleotide synthase ribozymes, constructs representing theoretical end products were synthesized {{and used to}} test the feasibility of the selective procedure. Dithienylethenes are molecules that interconvert between two isomers (each with unique properties) in response to different light stimuli. It was our interest to control DNA binding and RNA cleavage abilities of novel switches by light exposure.

40|$|Origins-of-life {{research}} requires {{searching for}} a plausible transition from simple chemicals to larger macromolecules that can both hold information and catalyze their own production. We have previously shown that some group I intron ribozymes possess the ability to help synthesize other ribozyme genotypes by recombination reactions in small networks in an autocatalytic fashion. By simplifying these recombination reactions, using fluorescent anisotropy, we quantified the thermodynamic binding strength between two nucleotides of two group I intron RNA fragments for all 16 possible genotype combinations. We provide evidence that the binding strength (KD) between the 3 -nucleotide internal guide sequence (IGS) of one ribozyme and its complement in another is correlated to the catalytic ability of the ribozyme.

In this study, we report the ultraconserved occurrence of hammerhead ribozymes in Amniota genomes (reptiles, birds and mammals, including humans), similar to those described previously in amphibians and platyhelminth parasites. The ribozymes mapped to intronic regions of different genes, such as the tumour suppressor RECK in birds and mammals, a mammalian tumour antigen and the dystrobrevin beta in lizards and birds. In vitro characterization confirmed a high self‐cleavage activity, whereas analysis of RECK‐expressed sequence tags revealed fusion events between the in vivo self‐cleaved intron and U 5 or U 6 small nuclear RNA fragments.

40|$|For years {{scientists}} have relentlessly {{searched for the}} origin of life on earth. Though many theories have been proposed most have been refuted through experimentation. One theory active today, is known as the 2 ̆ 2 RNA World Hypothesis 2 ̆ 2. According to the 2 ̆ 2 RNA World Hypothesis 2 ̆ 2, in the <b>prebiotic</b> milieu <b>RNA</b> superceded both DNA and proteins. This theory is based on the knowledge that RNA has a limited catalytic function and is capable of carrying genetic code, thus incorporating the functions of DNA and proteins. The data about RNA?s capabilities coupled with the idea that RNA could have catalyzed the reduction of ribose to deoxyribose in the primordial soup is a tantalizing proposition. At present DNA is produced in cells by protein enzymes, but DNA which is used as a template controls the synthesis of those proteins. If this is known to be the case, how did DNA first from? Our laboratory has proposed that RNA-based enzymes (ribozymes) catalyzed the early synthesis of DNA nucleotides without the use of proteins. We have begun to investigate this possibility using in vitro RNA selection techniques and have developed a sensitive chemical assay for enzymatic activity. Here we turn our attention toward incorporating transition metal cofactors into our synthetic ribozymes in an effort to enhance their catalytic activity. Iron and sulfur are theorized to have been prevalent in the primordial soup, and self-assemble into redox-active iron-sulfur clusters in proteins. By analogy, RNA?s that are capable of binding iron sulfur clusters may be discovered that can harness this cofactor to enhance RNA?s catalytic activity. These studies will provide insight into the possible existence of a metal-binding RNA molecules capable of generating the basic building blocks of DNA, and may provide a link between the ancient RNA world and modern living organisms...|$|R
40|$|All the {{strategies}} for the <b>prebiotic</b> syntheses of <b>RNA</b> and DNA assume the adequate availability of the presumptive precursors such as purine and pyrimidine nucleic bases, nucleosides and nucleotides. Polymerization of activated nucleotides probably furnished the first informational oligonucleotides. The formation of these precursors from mixtures of simple gases was shown to occur {{in a variety of}} conditions including UV-irradiation, electric discharge, heating, volcanic activity and marine vents. Even though a well-defined physical chemical scenario on the primitive Earth is not available, prebiotic syntheses were most probably performed using the simplest chemicals and the most common conditions present at that time. During these synthetic processes minerals played the relevant role of catalysts furnishing local microenvironments for the selective concentration of reagents and for the preservation of newly formed products. Here we focus on the optimal experimental conditions needed to carry out these syntheses and on the characterization of the major products thus obtained. Special attention will be addressed to catalyzed processes. Taken together, these procedures and data suggest novel scenarios for the molecular evolution of life on the primitive Earth and may provide a chemical clue to the evaluation of the plausible emergence of extraterrestrial forms of life...|$|R

Random polypeptide synthesis in a prebiotic world {{has the potential to}} initially produce only a very small fraction of polypeptides that can fold spontaneously into catalytic domains. However, that fraction can be enriched by proteolytic activities that destroy the unfolded polypeptides and regenerate amino acids that can be recycled into polypeptides. In this open system scenario the stable domains that accumulate and the chemical environment in which they are accumulated are linked through self coding of polypeptide structure.

40|$|In a <b>prebiotic</b> <b>RNA</b> world, {{parasitic}} behaviour may be favoured because template dependent replication {{happens in}} trans, thus being altruistic. Spatially extended systems {{are known to}} reduce harmful effects of parasites. Here we present a spatial system to show that evolution of replication is (indirectly) enhanced by strong parasites, and we characterise the phase transition that leads to this mode of evolution. Building on the insights of this analysis, we identify two scenarios, namely periodic disruptions and longer replication time-span, in which speciation occurs and an evolved parasite-like lineage enables the evolutionary increase of replication rates in replicators. Finally, we show that parasites co-evolving with replicators are selected to become weaker, i. e. worse templates for replication when the duration of replication is increased. We conclude that parasites may {{not be considered a}} problem for evolution in a prebiotic system, but a degree of freedom that can be exploited by evolution to enhance the evolvability of replicators, by means of emergent levels of selection...|$|E
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of slightly deleterious mutations in populations {{leads to the}} buildup of a genetic load and can cause the extinction of populations of small size. Mutation-accumulation experiments {{have been used to}} study this process {{in a wide variety of}} organisms, yet the exact mutational underpinnings of genetic loads and their fitness consequences remain poorly characterized. Here, we use an abiotic system of RNA populations evolving continuously in vitro to examine the molecular events that can instigate a genetic load. By tracking the fitness decline of ligase ribozyme populations with bottleneck sizes between 100 and 3000 molecules, we detected the appearance and subsequent fixation of both slightly deleterious mutations and advantageous mutations. Smaller populations went extinct in significantly fewer generations than did larger ones, supporting the notion of a mutational meltdown. These data suggest that mutation accumulation was an important evolutionary force in the <b>prebiotic</b> <b>RNA</b> world and that mechanisms such as recombination to ameliorate genetic loads may have been in place early in the history of life...|$|E
40|$|The {{prebiotic}} {{significance of}} laboratory experiments that study {{the interactions between}} oligomeric RNA and mineral species is difficult to know. Natural exemplars of specific minerals can differ widely depending on their provenance. While laboratory-generated samples of synthetic minerals can have controlled compositions, they are often viewed as "unnatural". Here, we show how trends in the interaction of RNA with natural mineral specimens, synthetic mineral specimens, and co-precipitated pairs of synthetic minerals, can make a persuasive case that the observed interactions reflect {{the composition of the}} minerals themselves, rather than their being simply examples of large molecules associating nonspecifically with large surfaces. Using this approach, we have discovered Periodic Table trends in the binding of oligomeric RNA to alkaline earth carbonate minerals and alkaline earth sulfate minerals, where those trends are the same when measured in natural and synthetic minerals. They are also validated by comparison of co-precipitated synthetic minerals. We also show differential binding of RNA to polymorphic forms of calcium carbonate, and the stabilization of bound RNA on aragonite. These have relevance to the <b>prebiotic</b> stabilization of <b>RNA,</b> where such carbonate minerals are expected to have been abundant, as they appear to be today on Mars...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{compounds}} {{would have}} been produced in an earth's atmosphere that was reducing. The soup would contain amino and hydroxy acids, together with smaller amounts of purines and pyrimidines. The presence' of sugars is less likely, although they can be produced by the formose reaction from formaldehyde. However, the <b>prebiotic</b> synthesis of <b>RNA</b> has not been demonstrated. One problem is that ribose is not produced selectively over other pentoses and hexoses, except under special conditions. The second problem is that ribose is unstable, with a half-life at pH 7 and 100 C of 73 minutes (44 years at 0 C). Other sugars are similarly unstable. Another {{problem is that there}} is no efficient prebiotic synthesis of polyphosphates, nor the glycosidic bond of nucleosides. This suggests that there may have been an informational macromolecule that preceded RNA. The RNA world refers to the time when RNA carried both the genetic information and the catalytic activity, and was subsequently converted to the DNA/protein world when protein synthesis began. Preceeding the RNA world was the Pre-RNA world, where a backbone different from ribose phosphate was used, and the bases may have been different from adenine, uracil, guanine and cytosine. We have shown recently that cytosine and uracil can be synthesized efficiently under prebiotic conditions using a dried lagoon model instead of the usual dilute ocean hypothesis. In addition, we have shown that uracil adds formaldehyde efficiently to give 5 - hydroxymethyl uracil, which in turn adds various nucleophiles to give uracil analogs of most of the amino acids that occur in proteins. For example, the ammonia, guanidine and imidazole adducts from the analogs of lysine, arginine and histidine. This suggests that the catalytic potential of RNA may have been much more extensive than previously assumed. The major problem is finding out what was the precursor to the ribose phosphate backbone. This will be the key to developing prebiotic self-replicating systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} the first RNA {{polymers}} is central to most current theories regarding the origin of life. However, difficulties associated with the <b>prebiotic</b> formation of <b>RNA</b> have lead many researchers to conclude that simpler polymers, or proto-RNAs, preceded RNA. These earlier polymers would {{have been replaced by}} RNA over the course of evolution. A remaining difficulty for this theory is that the de novo synthesis of a feasible proto-RNA has not yet been demonstrated by plausible prebiotic reactions. This thesis focuses on two problems associated with prebiotic proto-RNA synthesis: The formation of nucleosides and the necessity of reversible backbone linkages for error correction in nucleic acid polymers. "The Nucleoside Problem", or the lack of success in forming pyrimidine nucleosides by plausible prebiotic reactions, represents a significant stumbling block to the RNA world hypothesis. Nearly four decades ago Orgel and coworkers demonstrated that the purine nucleosides adenosine and inosine are synthesized by heating and drying their respective bases and ribose in the presence of magnesium, but these reaction conditions do not yield the pyrimidine nucleosides uridine or cytidine from their respective bases. In this thesis a potential solution to The Nucleoside Problem is hypothesized based upon a proposed chemical mechanism for nucleoside formation. This hypothesis is supported by the successful synthesis of 2 -pyrimidinone nucleosides by a plausible prebiotic reaction in good yield, demonstrating that pyrimidine nucleosides could have been available in the prebiotic chemical inventory, but that uridine and cytidine were likely not abundant. Reversible backbone linkages are necessary to provide a mechanism for error correction in non-enzymatic template-directed syntheses of proto-RNAs. In this thesis, acetals are explored as low-energy, reversible linkage groups for nucleosides in polymers. The synthesis of glyoxylate-acetal nucleic acids (gaNAs) through simple heating-drying reactions from neutral aqueous solutions is demonstrated, and these linkages are shown to be hydrolytically stable under a considerable range of solution conditions. Computational models demonstrate that the glyoxylate linkage is an excellent electronic and isosteric replacement for phosphate. Molecular dynamics simulations also indicate that a gaNA duplex would have structural properties that closely match a phosphate-linked RNA helix, suggesting the possibility for cross-pairing between gaNAs and RNAs, allowing for sequence transfer and genetic continuity through the evolution from proto-RNAs to RNA. The principles illustrated in this thesis by 2 -pyrimidinone nucleoside and gaNA synthesis can be extended to other prebiotic condensation reactions. Factors affecting condensation yield, such as thermodynamics, kinetics, reactant solubility, and salt effects, are summarized herein. Ph. D.

40|$|AbstractBackground: It is {{generally}} accepted that, during evolution, replicating RNA molecules emerged from pools of random polynucleotides. This <b>prebiotic</b> <b>RNA</b> world {{was followed by}} an era of RNA-mediated catalysis of amide-bond formation. RNA would thus have provided the machinery responsible for the assembly of peptides {{and the beginning of}} the protein world of today. Naturally occurring ribozymes, which catalyze the cleavage or ligation of oligonucleotide phosphodiester bonds, support the idea that RNA could self-replicate. But was RNA constrained to this path and were RNA-acylated carriers required before RNA could catalyze the formation of amide bonds?Results: We have isolated RNA catalysts that are capable of mediating amide-bond synthesis without the need for specifically designed templates to align the substrates, and we have kinetically characterized these catalysts. The rate enhancement observed for these RNA amide synthases exceeds the noncatalyzed amidation rate by a factor of ∼ 104. In addition, Cu 2 + ions caused a change in the affinity of RNA for the substrate rather than being directly involved in amide-bond formation. Conclusions: The discovery of these new amide synthases shows how functionally modified nucleic acids can facilitate covalent-bond formation without templating. Previously unforeseen RNA-evolution pathways can, therefore, be considered; for example, to guide amide-bond formation, en route to the protein world, it appears that substrate-binding pockets were formed that are analogous to those of protein enzymes...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{years of}} study, {{it is still}} not clear how life emerged from inanimate matter and evolved into the complex forms that we observe today. One of the most {{recognized}} hypotheses for the origins of life, the RNA World hypothesis, assumes that life was sparked by prebiotic replicating RNA chains. In this paper, we address the problems caused by the interplay between hypothetical <b>prebiotic</b> <b>RNA</b> replicases and RNA parasitic species. We consider the coexistence of parasite RNAs and RNA replicases as well as the impact of parasites on the further evolution of replicases. For these purposes, we used multi-agent modeling techniques that allow for realistic assumptions regarding the movement and spatial interactions of modeled species. The general model used in this study is based on work by Takeuchi and Hogeweg. Our results confirm that the coexistence of parasite RNAs and replicases is possible in a spatially extended system, even if we take into consideration more realistic assumptions than Takeuchi and Hogeweg. However, we also showed that the presence of trade-off that takes into the account an RNA folding process could still pose a serious obstacle to the evolution of replication. We conclude that this might be a cause for one of the greatest transitions in life that took place early in evolution-the separation of the function between DNA templates and protein enzymes, with a central role for RNA species...|$|E
40|$|The RNA World {{model for}} {{prebiotic}} evolution posits {{the selection of}} catalytic/template RNAs from random populations. The mechanisms by which these random populations could be generated de novo are unclear. Non-enzymatic and RNA-catalyzed nucleic acid polymerizations are poorly processive, {{which means that the}} resulting short-chain RNA population could contain only limited diversity. Nonreciprocal recombination of smaller RNAs provides an alternative mechanism for the assembly of larger species with concomitantly greater structural diversity; however, the frequency of any specific recombination event in a random RNA population is limited by the low probability of an encounter between any two given molecules. This low probability could be overcome if the molecules capable of productive recombination were redundant, with many nonhomologous but functionally equivalent RNAs being present in a random population. Here we report fluctuation experiments to estimate the redundancy of the set of RNAs in a population of random sequences that are capable of non-Watson-Crick interaction with another RNA. Parallel SELEX experiments showed that at least one in 106 random 20 -mers binds to the P 5. 1 stem–loop of Bacillus subtilis RNase P RNA with affinities equal to that of its naturally occurring partner. This high frequency predicts that a single RNA in an RNA World would encounter multiple interacting RNAs within its lifetime, supporting recombination as a plausible mechanism for <b>prebiotic</b> <b>RNA</b> evolution. The large number of equivalent species implies that the selection of any single interacting species in the RNA World would be a contingent event, i. e., one resulting from historical accident...|$|E

L 1 L serves as a proof of principle that RNA can catalyze a critical reaction for <b>prebiotic</b> <b>RNA</b> self-replication according to the RNA world hypothesis. L 1 L crystal structure captures two distinct conformations that differ by a reorientation of one of the stems by around 80 Å and are presumed to correspond to the active and inactive state, respectively. It is of great interest to understand the nature of these two states in solution and the pathway for their interconversion. In this study, we use explicit solvent molecular simulation together with a novel enhanced sampling method that utilizes concepts from network theory to map out the conformational transition between active and inactive states of L 1 L. We find that the overall switching mechanism can be described as a three-state/two-step process. The first step involves a large-amplitude swing that reorients stem C. The second step involves the allosteric activation of the catalytic site through distant contacts with stem C. Using a conformational space network representation of the L 1 L switch transition, it is shown that the connection between the three states follows different topographical patterns: the stem C swing step passes through a narrow region of the conformational space network, whereas the allosteric activation step covers a much wider region and a more diverse set of pathways through the network. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Background]: Catalytic RNAs, or ribozymes, are {{regarded}} as fossils of a <b>prebiotic</b> <b>RNA</b> world that have remained in the genomes of modern organisms. The simplest ribozymes are the small self-cleaving RNAs, like the hammerhead ribozyme, which have been historically considered biological oddities restricted to some RNA pathogens. Recent data, however, indicate that small self-cleaving ribozymes are widespread in genomes, although their functions are still unknown. [Results]: We reveal that hammerhead ribozyme sequences in plant genomes form {{part of a new}} family of small non-autonomous retrotransposons with hammerhead ribozymes, referred to as retrozymes. These elements contain two long terminal repeats of approximately 350 bp, each harbouring a hammerhead ribozyme that delimitates a variable region of 600 – 1000 bp with no coding capacity. Retrozymes are actively transcribed, which gives rise to heterogeneous linear and circular RNAs that accumulate differentially depending on the tissue or developmental stage of the plant. Genomic and transcriptomic retrozyme sequences are highly heterogeneous and share almost no sequence homology among species except the hammerhead ribozyme motif and two small conserved domains typical of Ty 3 -gypsy long terminal repeat retrotransposons. Moreover, we detected the presence of RNAs of both retrozyme polarities, which suggests events of independent RNA-RNA rolling-circle replication and evolution, similarly to that of infectious circular RNAs like viroids and viral satellite RNAs. [Conclusions]: Our work reveals that circular RNAs with hammerhead ribozymes are frequently occurring molecules in plant and, most likely, metazoan transcriptomes, which explains the ubiquity of these genomic ribozymes and suggests a feasible source for the emergence of circular RNA plant pathogens.

40|$|Approximately {{two-thirds of}} the {{elements}} in the periodic table can be cate-gorized as metals. Besides luster, malleability, and conductivity, {{one of the fundamental}} characteristics of metals is their low ionization potential. As a result, the ionic forms of these elements predominate in the bio-sphere. Considering the diverse properties of these ions, it is not surpris-ing that through the process of evolution, metal ions have been co-opted into numerous roles in biology. Metal ions are required for so many bio-chemical reactions that it is likely that they also had {{an important role in the}} RNA world. To understand both modern and <b>prebiotic</b> <b>RNA</b> bio-chemistry, it is therefore essential to have a basic understanding of these inorganic elements. Metal ions were abundant in the primordial soup. It is believed that 3. 8 × 109 years ago, the ocean was between 80 ˚C and 100 ˚C with a pH possibly as low as 6 (Bengston 1994). Table 1 shows the concentrations of the most common metal ions in today’s seas and in blood plasma. Although the concentrations of most of these ions in the prebiotic ocean are not known, the higher temperature and lower pH relative to the cur-rent ocean would have solvated a variety of ions and leached metal ions from the mineral-rich ocean beds. Therefore, the concentrations would have been significantly higher than the current values. One important additional difference is the extremely low concentration of easily oxi-dized metal ions such as Fe(II). Ferrous ion has been predicted to have been very abundant in the primordial ocean, as high as 0. 1 mM (Bengston 1994). Interestingly, this change is probably due to the fact that early life forms produced molecular oxygen from photosynthetic reactions that in turn caused a cascade of oxidation reactions to occur. The conversion of Fe(II) to the more acidic Fe(III) resulted in the formation of oxyhydrox-ide polymers that precipitated out of the ancient oceans, depleting the io...|$|E
