50|$|When Intel {{designed}} the 8087, it aimed {{to make a}} standard floating-point format for future designs. An {{important aspect of the}} 8087 from a historical perspective was that it became the basis for the IEEE 754 floating-point standard. The 8087 did not implement the eventual IEEE 754 standard in all its details, as the standard was not finished until 1985, but the 80387 did. The 8087 provided two basic 32/64-bit floating-point data types and an additional extended 80-bit internal temporary format (that could also be stored in memory) to improve accuracy over large and complex calculations. Apart from this, the 8087 offered an 80-bit/18-digit <b>packed</b> BCD (<b>binary</b> <b>coded</b> <b>decimal)</b> format and 16, 32, and 64-bit integer data types.|$|R

50|$|As the S/360 {{was to be}} a {{successor}} to both scientific machines like the 7090 and data processing machines like the 1401, it needed a design that could reasonably support all forms of processing. Hence the instruction set was designed to manipulate simple binary numbers, and text, scientific floating-point (similar to the numbers used in a calculator), and the <b>binary</b> <b>coded</b> <b>decimal</b> arithmetic needed by accounting systems.|$|R
5000|$|Burroughs {{produced}} the B2500 or [...] "medium systems" [...] computers aimed primarily {{at the business}} world. The machines were designed to execute COBOL efficiently. This included a BCD (<b>Binary</b> <b>Coded</b> <b>Decimal)</b> based arithmetic unit, storing and addressing the main memory using base 10 numbering instead of binary. The designation for these systems was Burroughs B2500 through B49xx, followed by Unisys V-Series V340 through V560.|$|R
25|$|Early in 1952, a {{high-speed}} shifter was added, which improved the speed for shifting {{by a factor}} of five. In July 1953, a 100-word expansion core memory was added to the system, using <b>binary</b> <b>coded</b> <b>decimal,</b> excess-3 number representation. To support this expansion memory, ENIAC was equipped with a new Function Table selector, a memory address selector, pulse-shaping circuits, and three new orders were added to the programming mechanism.|$|R
50|$|IBM's <b>Binary</b> <b>Coded</b> <b>Decimal</b> (BCD) was a six-bit {{encoding}} scheme used by IBM in {{as early as}} 1959 in its 1401 and 1620 computers, and in its 7000 Series (for example, 704, 7040, 709 and 7090 computers), {{as well as in}} associated peripherals. BCD extended existing simple four-bit numeric encoding to include alphabetic and special characters, mapping it easily to punch-card encoding which was already in widespread use. It was the precursor to EBCDIC.|$|R
50|$|In the OSI model: the {{presentation}} layer ensures {{the information that}} the application layer of one system sends out is readable by the application layer of another system. For example, a PC program communicates with another computer, one using extended <b>binary</b> <b>coded</b> <b>decimal</b> interchange <b>code</b> (EBCDIC) and the other using ASCII to represent the same characters. If necessary, {{the presentation}} layer {{might be able to}} translate between multiple data formats by using a common format.|$|R
5000|$|Extended <b>Binary</b> <b>Coded</b> <b>Decimal</b> Interchange <b>Code</b> (EBCDIC) is an eight-bit {{character}} encoding used {{mainly on}} IBM mainframe and IBM midrange computer operating systems. EBCDIC {{descended from the}} code used with punched cards and the corresponding six bit binary-coded <b>decimal</b> <b>code</b> used with most of IBM's computer peripherals of the late 1950s and early 1960s. [...] It is also supported on various non-IBM platforms such as Fujitsu-Siemens' BS2000/OSD, OS-IV, MSP, and MSP-EX, the SDS Sigma series, and Unisys VS/9 and MCP.|$|R
50|$|Also in September 1975 IBM {{announced}} the IBM 5100 Communications Adapter, {{that allowed the}} 5100 to transmit data to and receive data from a remote system. It made the 5100 appear the same as an IBM 2741 Communications Terminal and {{was designed to be}} able to communicate with IBM 2741 compatible machines in start-stop mode using the EBCD (Extended <b>Binary</b> <b>Coded</b> <b>Decimal)</b> notation. EBCD was similar to the more common IBM EBCDIC code, but not identical.|$|R
50|$|Early machine designs {{included}} some that used {{what is often}} termed a variable word length. In this type of organization, a numeric operand had no fixed length but rather its end was detected when a character with a special marking, often called word mark, was encountered. Such machines often used <b>binary</b> <b>coded</b> <b>decimal</b> for numbers. This class of machines included the IBM 702, IBM 705, IBM 7080, IBM 7010, UNIVAC 1050, IBM 1401, and IBM 1620.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the first}} {{microprocessors}} had a 4-bit word length and were developed around 1970. The TMS 1000, the world's first single-chip microprocessor, was a 4-bit CPU; it had a Harvard architecture, with an on-chip instruction ROM, 8-bit-wide instructions and an on-chip data RAM with 4-bit words. The first commercial microprocessor was the <b>binary</b> <b>coded</b> <b>decimal</b> (BCD-based) Intel 4004, developed for calculator applications in 1971; it had a 4-bit word length, but had 8-bit instructions and 12-bit addresses.|$|R
50|$|Early {{computers}} used {{a variety}} of four-bit <b>binary</b> <b>coded</b> <b>decimal</b> (BCD) representations and the six-bit codes for printable graphic patterns common in the U.S. Army (FIELDATA) and Navy. These representations included alphanumeric characters and special graphical symbols. These sets were expanded in 1963 to seven bits of coding, called the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) as the Federal Information Processing Standard, which replaced the incompatible teleprinter codes in use by different branches of the U.S. government and universities during the 1960s. ASCII included the distinction of upper- and lowercase alphabets and a set of control characters to facilitate the transmission of written language as well as printing device functions, such as page advance and line feed, and the physical or logical control of data flow over the transmission media. During the early 1960s, while also active in ASCII standardization, IBM simultaneously introduced in its product line of System/360 the eight-bit Extended <b>Binary</b> <b>Coded</b> <b>Decimal</b> Interchange <b>Code</b> (EBCDIC), an expansion of their six-bit binary-coded decimal (BCDIC) representation used in earlier card punches.The prominence of the System/360 led to the ubiquitous adoption of the eight-bit storage size, while in detail the EBCDIC and ASCII encoding schemes are different.|$|R
50|$|The 6502 {{is capable}} of {{performing}} addition and subtraction in <b>binary</b> or <b>binary</b> <b>coded</b> <b>decimal.</b> Placing the CPU into BCD mode with the SED (set D flag) instruction results in decimal arithmetic, in which $99 + $01 would result in $00 and the carry (C) flag being set. In binary mode (CLD, clear D flag), the same operation would result in $9A and the carry flag being cleared. Other than Atari BASIC, BCD mode was seldom used in home computer applications.|$|R
