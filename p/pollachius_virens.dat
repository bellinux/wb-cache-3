50|$|The role mechanoreception {{plays in}} {{schooling}} behavior was demonstrated in a 1976 study. A school of <b>Pollachius</b> <b>virens</b> {{was established in}} a tank and individual fish were removed and subjected to different procedures before their ability to rejoin the school was observed. Fish that were experimentally blinded were able to reintegrate into the school, while fish with severed lateral lines were unable to reintegrate themselves. Therefore, reliance on functional mechanoreception, not vision, is essential for schooling behavior.

50|$|Blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) {{has benefited}} from {{the decline of the}} herring and capelin stocks as it assumed the role of major {{predator}} of plankton. The blue whiting spawns near the British Isles. The sea currents carry their eggs to the Norwegian Sea, and the adults also swim there to benefit from the food supply. The young spend the summer and the winter until February in Norwegian coastal waters and then return to the warmer waters west of Scotland. The Norwegian Arctic cod mostly occurs in the Barents Sea and at the Svalbard Archipelago. In the rest of the Norwegian Sea, it is found only during the reproduction season, at the Lofoten Islands, whereas <b>Pollachius</b> <b>virens</b> and haddock spawn in the coastal waters. Mackerel is an important commercial fish. The coral reefs are populated by different species of the genus Sebastes.|$|E
50|$|Coastal marshes, bays, tidal creeks, {{and rivers}} support diverse {{shellfish}} and finfish populations. Sunfish (Lepomis species), creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), common mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), American eel (Anguilla rostrata), and white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) abound. Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) are stocked in rivers and estuaries each year. The Ogunquit River sustains alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), pollock (<b>Pollachius</b> <b>virens),</b> bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), longhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus octodecimspinosus), and winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus). The Webhannet River has native {{species such as}} winter flounder, northern pipefish (Syngnathus fuscus), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), common mummichog, Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) and Atlantic mackerel. The Merriland River sustains populations of American eel, brown trout, and brook trout. The Mousam River attracts little skate (Raja erinacea), American shad (Alosa sapidissima), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), bluefish, cunner, Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), pollock, and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). The Spurwink River supports blueback herring, Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), American shad, pollock, cunner, winter flounder, and little skate. Striped bass and brown trout are popular recreational fishing resources in the area. The National Marine Fisheries Service has designated as “essential fish habitat” areas that provide substrate necessary for fish spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity. Estuaries within the refuge boundaries are part of that essential fish habitat.|$|E

40|$|Current {{and future}} climate {{alterations}} might impact ecological processes like timing of breeding. We used multivariate linear models {{to assess the}} importance of food availability and climate on timing of breeding and hatching brood size of European shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis in 2 colonies, Sklinna (65 ° N) and Røst (67 ° N), in the Norwegian Sea over 21 yr (1989 to 2009). Predictor variables were ICES abundance estimates of young saithe <b>Pollachius</b> <b>virens,</b> the staple food of shags in these colonies, the previous winter’s North Atlantic Oscillation index (wNAO), and sea surface and air temperatures. Annual population size was included to control for density-dependent effects. The best model for hatching date explained 15 % (Sklinna) and 70 % (Røst) of the variation and showed that shags bred earlier when 1 yr old saithe were more abundant. The model for Røst also included 2 yr old saithe and wNAO. The best model for hatching brood size explained 40 % (Sklinna) and 48 % (Røst) and included a positive effect of population size at both sites. The model for Røst also included a positive effect of 1 yr old saithe. Our study demonstrates that abundance of 1 yr old saithe is a key factor for the breeding performance of shags in both colonies, whereas the climate variables were of less importance. Delayed breeding and low brood size were not associated with a high population of breeders, indicating breeding performance was density-independent and that the positive relationship between breeding numbers and saithe abundance mainly reflected variation in non-breeding among established breeders.

40|$|The saithe, <b>Pollachius</b> <b>virens</b> (L.) is {{a marine}} fish, rep-resenting the family Gadidae. It {{naturally}} {{occurs in the}} North Atlantic Ocean {{and it has been}} rarely reported from the Baltic Sea (Froese and Pauly 2008). The hitherto con-ducted parasitic surveys of this fish focused on the Atlantic, particularly the Sea of Norway and the Barents Sea (e. g., Rokicki and Strömberg 1991, Karasev et al. 1996, Strømnes and Andersen 1998, Lom 2002). The Baltic Sea is a brackish inland body of water with salinities ranging from 3. 7 PSU (Bothnian Bay) to 8 PSU (Pomeranian Bay) (Łomniewski et al. 1975). Its animal-and plant species diversity is much lower than that of full-salinity seas. It is particularly evident in the composition of its fish fauna and invertebrate fauna. The low species diversity of potential definitive, intermediate, or paratenic hosts may also theoretically affect the species richness of fish parasites (Rhode 2002, Zander and Reimer 2002). Therefore {{it would be interesting to}} compare the parasite faunas of saithe from the Baltic Sea and Atlantic Ocean. The results of the presently reported study comprise the first published parasite records of saithe from the Baltic Sea off Polish coast. In March 2007, a single, semi-ripe female saithe, <b>Pollachius</b> <b>virens</b> (99 cm TL, 9. 2 kg), was caught in the Gulf of Gdańsk. The fish was promptly subjected to a standard parasitological necropsy. The microsporidians found were smeared on a microscopic slide and mounted in glycerolgelatine.

40|$|A central {{problem when}} using {{commercial}} catch per unit effort (CPUE) as {{an index of}} fish stock abundance is that fishing vessels search for concentrations of fish.

In this work, the relationship between catchability and two measures {{of the degree of}} spatial concentration of a trawl fleet (the fleet’s spatial extent and the fleet’s degree of spatial patchiness) is investigated for four different fish stocks. The catchability of northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua) is strongly related to the fleet’s degree of spatial concentration, but the relationship is weaker for northeast Arctic haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), and no relationships appear for two saithe (<b>Pollachius</b> <b>virens)</b> stocks.

The analysis of these two fractions on otolith macrostructures was performed using Raman microspectrometry on both translucent and opaque zones of otoliths of pollock (<b>Pollachius</b> <b>virens)</b> and European hake (Merluccius merluccius). The magnitude of the Raman signatures of the aragonite and organic fractions were strongly correlated to otolith opacity with maxima in translucent zones. Opacity models, built from Raman signatures, successfully predicted the observed opacity for both species. A partial decorrelation of different aragonite signatures between translucent and opaque zones was revealed and discussed in terms of organisation (size, orientation) of aragonite crystals. Two categories of organic signatures with opposite effects on the opacity were identified, suggesting differences in organic compounds and (or) variations in their relative quantities.

The objectives of this first workshop were to review, document and make recom-mendations on current methods of aging saithe (<b>Pollachius</b> <b>virens).</b> This workshop was preceded by an otolith exchange in 2013, which was undertaken using WebGR. Participants who hadn’t taken part in the exchange were asked to annotate the images in the {{months prior to the}} workshop, however, due to problems with accessing WebGR only a limited amount of the readers managed to do this in time. The otolith collection included 298 images from the North Sea and the Barents Sea. The overall agreement with modal age of the pre-workshop exercise was 85. 9 %, with a precision of 6. 2 % CV. The images were analysed and the differences discussed and guidelines were established from this discussion. To test the guidelines a set of 50 otoliths from the Barents Sea was read during the workshop. These were read both with reflected and transmitted light and had an agreement ranging between 79. 2 % and 82. 3 % with a precision ranging from 3. 7 % to 4. 6 % CV. There was clear bias be-tween the individual readers using the two different light sources. Width measure-ment analysis of the 50 otoliths was carried out in plenary after agreeing on the ages of 48 of the 50 otoliths to determine the continuity of the position of the growth rings. In general, the understanding of the annual rings was high between the readers, and there was little disagreement, however, since the otolith preparation is different among institutes, there was discussion especially about the perception of the edge. Readers used to reading broken otoliths found it difficult to read the edges of the image of the slides. Therefore, we recommend that both broken and slides are com-pared during the next saithe exchange along with images on WebGR...|$|E

Predatorprey {{interactions}} have been seen during the massive wintering of herring (Clupea harengus) in steep bottomed topography in Lofoten, northwestern Norway. We applied hydro-acoustics to document how killer whales (Orcinus orca) and Atlantic saithe (<b>Pollachius</b> <b>virens)</b> herd and trap herring in shallow waters before attacking their prey. A group of eight killer whales and a shoal consisting of hundreds of saithe concentrated their attack {{on the side of the}} herring schools that faced away from the shallow area. They thus effectively herded the herring towards the shallower water. The predators then surrounded the schools, preventing the herring from escaping to deeper, darker and safer water. Some predators attacked herring by penetrating the school, while others continued surrounding the school. These are the first, well-documented hydro-acoustic observations of this hunting tactic. Further research will reveal if this hunting tactic is common and widespread among other species of marine mammals and fish preying on fish schools in coastal waters...|$|E
