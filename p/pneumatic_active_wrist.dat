We do not know, how-ever, whether acupuncture may enhance the effect of strength training on motor function. This study compared upper-limb motor functional improvement in chronic stroke survivors who received a combination of acupuncture and strength training with that of subjects who received strength training alone. A total of 10 chronic stroke patients with moderate or severe wrist muscle spasticity were recruited for this study. The study used a crossover design with a random order of either com-bined electroacupuncture and strength training or strength training alone. Each subject received one of the two types of treatment twice a week for the first 6 weeks and switched to the other for another 6 weeks. Quantitative measurements of <b>wrist</b> spasticity, <b>active</b> <b>wrist</b> extension range of motion, isometric wrist strength, and clinical evaluation with Fugl-Meyer (FM) upper-limb motor scores were conducted before and after either treatment.

This work examines load magnitudes and load sharing at the distal radius and ulna during of <b>active</b> <b>wrist</b> and forearm motion. Two instrumented implants were designed to measure in vitro loading in cadaveric specimen. The implants were evaluated and found reliable for use in further biomechanical studies. An in vitro study investigated the effect of joint angle and direction of joint motion on loads in the distal radius and ulna during active flexion-extension, radioulnar deviation and dart throw motion. Loads through the distal radius and ulna were significantly greater in extension and reverse dart throw motion than in flexion and forward dart throw motion. A subsequent study examined the effect of radial length changes, joint angle and direction of motion on distal radius and ulna loading during active forearm rotation. Load magnitudes through the distal radius were greater in supination than in pronation. Radial lengthening found to increase radial loading and decrease ulnar loading and radial shortening decreased distal radius loading and increased distal ulna loading throughout forearm rotation, in a quasilinear fashion.

40|$|Objective: In this study, we {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the additional benefits of ES (electrical stimulation) combined with EMG-BF (electromyographic biofeedback) on motor and functional outcomes in 30 patients admitted to Eskişehir Osmangazi University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Metarials and Methods: Medicine and Rehabilitation, with hemiparetic upper xtremity after stroke. The patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 was assigned to exercise and ES, group 2 - to exercise, EMG-BF and ES, and group 3 – to exercise alone. All procedures were administered for one hour a day, 5 days in a week, for 4 weeks. The Barthel Index (BI), Upper Extremity Function Test, Brunnstrom stages of motor recovery for hands, goniometric measurement of <b>active</b> <b>wrist</b> extension and the Motricity Index (MI) {{were used to assess}} the efficiency of treatment. Results: There were statistically significant improvements in Brunnstrom stages of motor recovery for hand (p< 0. 05), goniometric measurement of <b>active</b> <b>wrist</b> extension (p< 0. 05), upper extremity function test (p< 0. 01), BI (group 1 p< 0. 05, group 2 p< 0. 01) and MI (group 1 p< 0. 05, group 2 p< 0. 01) for both first and second groups after treatment. In group 3, significant improvement was found only in MI. Advanced significant improvement in surface EMG activity was observed only in group 2 (p< 0. 01). Conclusion: Although our results do not support the efficacy of combined therapy, considering the mechanisms of effects of ES and EMG-BF, it can be suggested that ES and EMG-BF are complementary procedures.

ParticipantsForty outpatients with contracture following distal radial fracture. InterventionThe {{control group}} received routine care consisting of exercises and advice for 8 weeks. In addition to routine care, {{during the day}} the experimental group received a dynamic splint, which stretched the wrist into extension but allowed intermittent movement. Outcome measuresThe primary outcomes were passive wrist extension and the Patient Rated Hand Wrist Evaluation (PRHWE). The secondary outcomes were <b>active</b> <b>wrist</b> extension, flexion, radial deviation, and ulnar deviation, and the performance and satisfaction items of the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM). All outcomes were measured at commencement, {{at the end of}} 8 weeks of treatment, and at 12 weeks (ie, 1 month follow-up). ResultsThe mean between-group difference for passive wrist extension and PRHWE at 8 weeks were 4 deg (95 % CI − 4 to 12) and − 2 points (95 % CI − 8 to 4), respectively. The corresponding values at 12 week follow-up were 6 deg (95 % CI 1 to 12) and 2 points (95 % CI − 5 to 9). There were no sufficiently important between-group differences for any of the secondary outcome measures at 8 or 12 weeks.

40|$|Abstract Background Occupational {{computer}} use {{has been associated}} with upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders (UEMSDs), but the etiology and pathophysiology of some of these disorders are poorly understood. Various theories attribute the symptoms to biomechanical and/or psychosocial stressors. The results of several clinical studies suggest that elevated antagonist muscle tension may be a biomechanical stress factor. Affected {{computer use}}rs often exhibit limited wrist range of motion, particularly wrist flexion, which has been attributed to increased extensor muscle tension, rather than to pain symptoms. Recreational or domestic activities requiring extremes of wrist flexion may produce injurious stress on the wrist joint and muscles, the symptoms of which are then exacerbated by computer use. As these activities may involve a variety of forearm postures, we examined whether changes in forearm posture have an effect on pain reports during wrist flexion, or whether pain would have a limiting effect on flexion angle. Methods We measured maximum <b>active</b> <b>wrist</b> flexion using a goniometer with the forearm supported in the prone, neutral, and supine postures. Data was obtained from 5 subjects with UEMSDs attributed to computer use and from 13 control subjects. Results The UEMSD group exhibited significantly restricted wrist flexion compared to the control group in both wrists at all forearm postures {{with the exception of the}} non-dominant wrist with the forearm prone. In both groups, maximum <b>active</b> <b>wrist</b> flexion decreased at the supine forearm posture compared to the prone posture. No UEMSD subjects reported an increase in pain symptoms during testing. Conclusion The UEMSD group exhibited reduced wrist flexion compared to controls that did not appear to be pain related. A supine forearm posture reduced wrist flexion in both groups, but the reduction was approximately 100 % greater in the UEMSD group. The effect of a supine forearm posture on wrist flexion is consistent with known biomechanical changes in the distal extensor carpi ulnaris tendon that occur with forearm supination. We infer from these results that wrist extensor muscle passive tension may be elevated in UEMSD subjects compared to controls, particularly in the extensor carpi ulnaris muscle. Measuring wrist flexion at the supine forearm posture may highlight flexion restrictions that are not otherwise apparent. </p...|$|R
40|$|Various {{mechanisms}} may alter corticomotor excitability to agonist and antagonist muscles during {{passive and}} active limb movement depending on parameters {{of movement and}} their functional role. A better understanding of these relationships is important for understanding basic motor control mechanisms, and may be relevant to motor rehabilitation programs after brain injury. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to compare changes in corticomotor excitability to wrist flexor and extensor muscles during different phases of movement (flexion/extension), and at rest and during actively or passively-mediated length changes. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) of the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) were recorded from 17 participants during resting and four movement conditions (passive wrist flexion and extension, <b>active</b> <b>wrist</b> flexion and extension) with their palm inserted into a hand piece. Passive and active movements were carried out by moving the hand piece for 22. 5 ° wrist flexion and 22. 5 ° wrist extension from the neutral wrist position of 0 ° at a cycle rate of 1 Hz. transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was delivered at the neutral position (0 °) every ten cycles to obtain 12 MEPs. The mean MEP amplitude was compared across the resting, lengthening and shortening phases for passive and active movements for the FCR and ECR separately by a paired t-test. Comparison was also made between FCR and ECR, and between passive and active movements by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The MEP amplitude was significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) reduced during passive lengthening for the FCR and ECR; but increased significantly during shortening only for the FCR compared with the resting state. In contrast, the MEP amplitude of the FCR and ECR increased in both active lengthening and shortening compared with the resting state, but the increase was significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) greater for shortening than lengthening phase. These results suggest that changes in corticomotor excitability are similar between the FCR and ECR, and between passive and active movements, and suggest that common underlying mechanisms exist in the modulation of corticomotor excitability during passive and <b>active</b> <b>wrist</b> movements...|$|R

However we still have an incomplete understanding of how proprioception differs between joints, whether it differs among the various degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) within a particular joint, and how such differences affect motor control and learning. We here introduce a robot-aided method to objectively measure proprioceptive function: specifically, we systematically mapped wrist proprioceptive acuity across the three DoFs of the wrist/hand complex with the aim to characterize the wrist position sense. Thirty healthy young adults performed an ipsilateral active joint position matching task with their dominant wrist using a haptic robotic exoskeleton. Our results indicate that the <b>active</b> <b>wrist</b> position sense acuity is anisotropic across the joint, with the abduction/ adduction DoF having the highest acuity (the error of acuity for flexion/extension is 4. 64 ± 0. 24 °; abduction/adduction: 3. 68 ± 0. 32 °; supination/pronation: 5. 15 ± 0. 37 °) and they also revealed that proprioceptive acuity decreases for smaller joint displacements.

Materials and methods. The present study is based on a survey of children with cerebral palsy with affected upper limb. The main criterion for selection of patients was the presence of active extension deficit in the wrist joint, both isolated and in combination with other contractures of the upper limb joints. Total 22 patients with spastic forms of cerebral palsy were examined. Results and conclusions. Green operation is a good method of surgical treatment of active extension deficit in the wrist joint in patients with cerebral palsy. In the presence of moderately severe contractures in the wrist joint, serial casting can eliminate them completely. Presence of a fixed pronation contracture of the forearm is a factor that reduces the effectiveness of FCU transplantation. Pronation contracture should be corrected before or during Green surgery. FCU transplantation is effective for children of any age, but its effectiveness is reduced from 12 years old...|$|R

40|$|Refractory to most {{types of}} treatment, neuropathic pain (NP) {{is a major}} problem for people living with spinal cord injury (SCI). The {{underlying}} mechanisms among problems related to treatment are poorly understood. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the association between cortical reorganization and NP after SCI. Twenty-four individuals with sensorimotor complete and incomplete paraplegia and tetraplegia (12 with NP, 13 pain free) and 31 healthy individuals were examined. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess activation in primary somatosensory and motor cortices in response to motor (ie, <b>active</b> and passive <b>wrist</b> extension) and sensory (ie, heat and brushing) tasks applied on the dorsum of the hand. In individuals with SCI, there were no group-level differences in task-related activation (ie, movement or sensory) compared with the healthy controls. However, based on the Euclidean distance measure, individuals with SCI demonstrated a lateral shift of peak activity in primary sensory and motor cortices (P < . 05). Among those with NP, chronic pain intensity inversely correlated with the magnitude of the shift in the primary motor cortex during <b>active</b> <b>wrist</b> extension. The findings reveal that NP in motor and sensory tasks at or above the level of the lesion is not associated with increased plasticity. In line with previous studies, changes in somatotopy and activation after SCI are rather limited and the influence of NP on plasticity remains controversial.

40|$|Background: Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{a universal}} disease with clinical presentations and impacts varying in different ethnic groups. The process of inflammatory joint damage quantified by ESR, CRP, number of tender and swollen joints can lead to structural impairment and deformity of wrists and hands. However, the relationship between hand impairment and disability in early RA is controversial. A comparison of this relationship in different population groups would add {{to the understanding of}} country-specific impacts of RA. This study compared the correlations of disease activity and hand impairment with self-report hand function between two early RA populations from the UK and China. Methods: A cohort comparison study was conducted. 60 Chinese patients recruited from Shanghai, China were matched on gender and age with 60 patients from a prospective early RA cohort from the UK (SARAH trial). The procedures of data collection in China followed the standard operating procedures employed in the SARAH trial. Outcome measures including MHQ, medical history and physical assessments were used to assess disease activity, hand impairment and function. Results: There was no significant association (P? 0. 05) between hand function with MCP joint deformity in either population group. Correlations between hand function with range of movement measured by <b>active</b> <b>wrist</b> flexion, combined finger flexion and composite finger extension were weak in both the UK and Chinese population (r? 0. 04, p? 0. 05). The associations between self-report overall hand function and full grip strength were moderate to weak in Chinese patients (dominant r= 0. 473 and non-dominant r= 0. 347, p? 0. 05). The correlations were weak between overall hand function and pinch grip among Chinese patients (p? 0. 05). However, correlations between hand function and full grip strength were moderate in UK patients (dominant r= 0. 582 and non-dominant r= 0. 555, p? 0. 05). Moderate relationships were found between hand function and pinch strength in the UK patients (dominant r= 0. 647 and non-dominant r= 0. 624, p? 0. 05). There were strong to moderate negative correlations between hand function and pain in both population groups (UK r=- 0. 690 and China r=- 0. 458, p? 0. 05). A moderate negative correlation was found between hand function and swelling (r=- 0. 45, p? 0. 001) and a moderate correlation between dexterity and hand function (dominant r= 0. 441, non-dominant r= 0. 440, p? 0. 05) in Chinese patients. However, no significant association (P? 0. 05) was found between hand function and swelling or hand function and dexterity among UK patients. Conclusion: In early RA populations in both the UK and China, hand strength, range of movement and pain are indicators of hand function. There is a weaker correlation between hand strength with self-reported hand function in the Chinese population compared with the UK RA patients.

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} pairing {{a startling}} stimulus {{with a simple}} reaction time (RT) task have shown that when participants are startled, a prepared movement may be triggered earlier in comparison to voluntary initiation (Carlsen et al. 2003, in press; Siegmund et al. 2001; Valls-Solé et al. 1999). The use of this paradigm in experiments may provide new insights into processes that control rapid voluntary actions. However, because the startle response habituates with repeated exposure to the startling stimulus, its use in experiments may be limited. Previously Brown et al. (1991) and later Siegmund et al. (2001) noted that individuals habituate to a startling stimulus at different rates depending on the required activity level of the participant in the task. The present experiment was designed to determine {{the rate at which}} participants habituate to a startle during the completion of a RT task. Participants completed 100 trials in which an <b>active</b> <b>wrist</b> extension to a target was performed as fast as possible following an auditory tone. An unexpected 124 dB auditory startle stimulus accompanied the imperative stimulus in 20 of these trials. For the duration of the experiment, startle response electromyographic (EMG) activity continued to be produced in the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) indicating that habituation was not complete after 20 startle trials. Furthermore RT in the startle condition was significantly shorter than control RT. However, findings indicate that when a measurable EMG burst in the SCM was present, RT was significantly shorter than when no SCM burst was present...|$|R
40|$|Constraint-induced {{movement}} therapy (CIMT) is {{a commonly}} used rehabilitation intervention to improve upper limb function after stroke. CIMT was originally developed {{for patients with}} a chronic upper limb paresis. Although {{there are indications that}} exercise interventions should start as early as possible after stroke, only a few randomized controlled trials have been published on either CIMT or modified forms of CIMT (mCIMT) during the acute phase after stroke. The implementation of (m) CIMT in published studies is very heterogeneous in terms of content, timing and intensity of therapy. Moreover, mCIMT studies often fail to provide {{a detailed description of the}} protocol applied. The purpose of the present paper is therefore to describe the essential elements of the mCIMT protocol as developed for the EXplaining PLastICITy after stroke (EXPLICIT-stroke) study. The EXPLICIT-stroke mCIMT protocol emphasizes restoring body functions, while preventing the development of compensatory movement strategies. More specifically, the intervention aims to improve <b>active</b> <b>wrist</b> -and finger extension, which is assumed to be a key factor for upper limb function. The intervention starts within 2 weeks after stroke onset. The protocol retains two of the three key elements of the original CIMT protocol, that is, repetitive training and the constraining element. Repetitive task training is applied for 1 hour per working day, and the patients wear a mitt for at least 3 hours per day for three consecutive weeks. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that a transcortical reflex contributes to the stretch-evoked long-latency electromyographic (e. m. g.) response we documented the responses of identified corticomotoneuronal (c. m.) cells and their target muscles to perturbations of <b>active</b> <b>wrist</b> movements. Macaque monkeys performed ramp-and-hold wrist movements against elastic loads, alternating between flexion and extension zones; brief (25 ms) torque pulses were intermittently applied during the hold period. C. m. cells were identified by a clear post-spike facilitation in spike-triggered averages of forelimb muscle e. m. g. activity. Activity of c. m. cells and twelve wrist and digit flexor and extensor muscles was recorded during: (a) <b>active</b> ramp-and-hold <b>wrist</b> movements, (b) passive ramp-and-hold wrist movements, and (c) torque perturbations applied during the hold phase of active flexion and extension which either lengthened or shortened the c. m. cell's target muscles. Muscle-lengthening perturbations evoked a reproducible pattern of average e. m. g. activity in the stretched muscles, consisting of two peaks: the first response (M 1) had an onset latency of 11. 2 +/- 2. 1 ms (mean +/- S. D.), and the second (M 2) began at 27. 9 +/- 5. 1 ms. Torque perturbations which shortened the active muscles also evoked a characteristic e. m. g. response consisting of an initial cessation of activity at 13. 5 +/- 3. 4 ms followed by a peak beginning at 33. 9 +/- 3. 0 ms. The responses of twenty-one c. m. cells which facilitated wrist muscles were documented with torque pulse perturbations applied during active muscle contraction. Twenty of twenty-one c. m. cells responded at short latency (23. 4 +/- 8. 8 ms) to torque perturbations which stretched their target muscles. For each c. m. cell-target muscle pair, transcortical loop time was calculated as {{the sum of the}} onset latency of the c. m. cell's response to lengthening perturbations (afferent time) and the onset latency of post-spike facilitation (efferent time). The mean transcortical loop time was 30. 4 +/- 10. 2 ms, comparable to the mean onset latency of the M 2 peak (27. 9 +/- 5. 1). The duration of a c. m. cell's response to torque perturbations provides a further measure of the extent of its potential contribution to the M 2 muscle response. In all cases but two, the c. m. cell response, delayed by the latency of the post-spike facilitation, overlapped the M 2 e. m. g. peak...|$|R
40|$|Children with hemiplegic {{cerebral}} palsy often have marked hand involvement with excessive thumb adduction and flexion and limited <b>active</b> <b>wrist</b> extension from infancy. Post-lesional aberrant plasticity {{can lead to}} progressive abnormalities of the developing motor system. Disturbances of somatosensory and visual function and developmental disregard contribute to difficulties with hand use. Progressive soft tissue and bony changes may occur, leading to contractures which further limit function in a vicious cycle. Early intervention might help to break this cycle: however, the precise nature and appropriateness of the intervention must be carefully considered. Traditional approaches to the hemiplegic upper limb include medications and botulinum toxin injections to manage abnormalities of tone, and surgical interventions. Therapist input, including provision of orthoses, remains a mainstay although many therapies have not been well evaluated. There has been a recent increase in interventions for the hemiplegic upper limb, mostly aimed outside the period of infancy. These include trials of constraint-induced movement therapy and bimanual therapy {{as well as the}} use of virtual reality and robot-assisted therapy. In future, non-invasive brain stimulation may be combined with therapy. Interventions under investigation in the infant age group include modified constraint-induced movement therapy and action observation therapy. A further approach which may be suited to the infant with thumb-in-palm deformity, but which requires evaluation, is the use of elastic taping. Enhanced cutaneous feedback through mechanical stimulation to the skin provided by the tape during movement has been postulated to modulate ongoing muscle activity. If effective, this would represent a low-cost, safe, widely applicable early intervention...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the clinical remission {{by means of}} power Doppler ultrasonographic (PDUS) monitoring {{in a group of}} patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in clinical remission (DAS 28 < 2. 6). The study included 54 patients with RA in therapy with DMARDS, anti-TNF, or no therapy in clinical remission according to ACR criteria and DAS 28 < 2. 6 for at least 6 months. All patients had <b>active</b> <b>wrist</b> or hand inflammation in the past. US examination evaluated the presence of active synovitis, power Doppler signal, and synovial hypertrophy on the following bilateral joints: metacarpophalangeal-proximal interphalangeal joints-flexor tendons (on 2 °- 3 ° fingers) and wrist (radiocarpal and midcarpal joints). In 19 patients, there was an agreement between clinical and US parameters. However, 35 patients with clinical remission showed a positive ultrasonographic assessment and at least an active parameter. No statistic correlation was found between US examination and antibody assessment (anti-CCP and/or RF). Patients in therapy with anti-TNF or other therapies showed similar US assessment without significant statistical differences. Among eleven patients that presented swollen and tender joints at the latest physical examination, which preceded US exam, just 5 patients had an US confirmation too. In the other patients, the PDUS did not confirm the presence of inflammation in the corresponding swollen and tender joints or showed a positive ultrasonographic assessment in other locations. The remission state is a great therapy target and not only through the biological therapy. Synovial inflammation could persist independently from type of therapy or autoantibody statu...|$|R
40|$|Three {{patients}} with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME), {{two of them}} clinically manifesting only negative myoclonus and the other manifesting {{both positive and negative}} myoclonus, were electrophysiologically investigated, and compared with two other {{patients with}} PME presenting with only positive myoclonus. Electric stimulation of the median nerve during sustained <b>active</b> <b>wrist</b> extension in the three patients with negative myoclonus often elicited a short lapse of the posture in the stimulated hand associated with a silent period in the muscle discharge with or without being preceded by an abrupt increase in the muscle discharge (C reflex). The occurrence of the stimulus-induced silent period was significantly correlated with that of the giant somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), and in two patients the silent period was elicited also in the opposite (non-stimulated) hand when the giant SEP was recorded at the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulus as well. In one patient, the duration of the silent period was positively correlated with the amplitude of the cortical SEP. Furthermore, the duration of the induced silent period was closely related to the recovery junction of SEP in each individual case. In contrast, in the two patients manifesting only positive myoclonus, the silent period was not elicited by the peripheral stimulation, and the somatosensory cortex was hyperexcitable immediately after the peripheral stimulus. Thus, this stimulus-sensitive negative myoclonus is mediated by a transcortical reflex mechanism, and corresponds to the negative form of the cortical reflex myoclonus ('cortical reflex negative myoclonus'). Key words: negative myoclonus; asterixis; transcortical reflex; cortical myoclonus; cortical reflex negative myoclonu...|$|R
