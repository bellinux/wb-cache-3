40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that the awareness of death can be a barrier to creative expression. Specifically, when mortality is rendered salient, creativity is inhibited. However, no studies have considered how individual differences may impact the effect of mortality salience on creativity. Past {{research has found that}} mortality salience increases explorative thought processes for individuals low in <b>personal</b> <b>need</b> for structure. Thus, for these people, mortality salience may increase, not decrease, creativity. The current study examined this possibility. <b>Personal</b> <b>need</b> for structure was measured, mortality salience was experimentally manipulated, and creativity was assessed. As predicted, mortality salience increased creativity amongst individuals low in <b>personal</b> <b>need</b> for structure. No effect of mortality salience was observed amongst individuals high in <b>personal</b> <b>need</b> for structure...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a pilot study of the impact of <b>Personal</b> <b>Need</b> for Structure of the selected mathematical competence. We were interested whether there is a relationship between cognitive-personal variable (<b>Personal</b> <b>Need</b> for Structure) and the mathematical knowledge about fractions of freshmen. We realized the experiment with 113 students of the Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra, Slovakia. We examined statistically significant dependencies between the cognitive-personality variable of the <b>Personal</b> <b>Need</b> for Structure and its subfactors F 1 (the wish of the structure) and F 2 (the reaction to the lack of the structure) and the success rate of solving tasks and word problems with fractions. We used statistical Cochrane Q test to detect dependencies between factors of the <b>Personal</b> <b>Need</b> for Structure scale and the Mathematical knowledge. We proved that the success rate of solving word problems with fractions is inversely proportional to the need for the structure. This means that the higher the overall score on the <b>Personal</b> <b>Need</b> for Structure scale and its subfactors is, the lower is the success rate of solving the word problems.|$|R

40|$|Research {{derived from}} terror {{management}} {{theory suggests that}} death cognition {{does not lead to}} death-anxiety because people respond to thoughts of death by turning to social and cultural structures that provide a sense of psychological security. However, recent research indicates that it is people high, but not low, in <b>personal</b> <b>need</b> for structure that turn to social and cultural structures in response to heightened death cognition. Such findings suggest that people low in PNS may be vulnerable to experiencing death-anxiety when death thoughts are activated. The current study explored this possibility. Individual differences in <b>personal</b> <b>need</b> for structure were measured and death cognition (mortality salience) was manipulated. Subsequently, death-anxiety was assessed. Mortality salience increased death-anxiety, but only among individuals low in <b>personal</b> <b>need</b> for structure...|$|R
5000|$|The meaning {{maintenance}} {{model of}} sociology states {{that when a}} committed meaning framework is threatened, people experience an arousal state that prompts them to affirm any other meaning framework {{to which they are}} committed. Researchers sought to illustrate this phenomenon by demonstrating a heightened <b>personal</b> <b>need</b> for structure following the experience of abstract artwork. [...] Participants were randomly assigned to a between-subjects viewing of artwork (abstract vs. representational vs. absurd artwork), followed by allocation of the <b>Personal</b> <b>Need</b> for Structure scale. <b>Personal</b> <b>Need</b> for Structure scale is used to detect temporary increases in people’s need for meaning. Theoretically, one should experience more need for structure when viewing abstract art than figurative art since unrelated meaning threats (abstract art) evoke a temporarily heightened general need for meaning. However, results showed that overall scores for representational art, and abstract art did not differ significantly from one another. Participants reported higher scores on the <b>Personal</b> <b>Need</b> for Structure scale in absurd rather than abstract art. Yet, the question remains as to whether the same kinds of results would be obtained with an expanded sample of abstract expressionist or absurd images.|$|R

These industries include a vinegar factory and a wood, and bamboo furniture and hut processing plant in barangay Santos, {{as well as}} rattan shop in Barucboc. Another major observation that {{can be obtained from}} the distribution of business enterprises in the municipality is the presence of activities that caters {{to the needs of the}} agricultural sector or the <b>personal</b> <b>needs</b> and requirements of residents. For instance, there are four business activities concentrated in barangay Arellano, which supply agricultural equipment from nearby municipalities such as Mallig and Roxas. This condition is brought about by the fact that some farmers especially in barangays quite distant from the Poblacion such as Turod and Barucboc have accessibility problems. It was learned also that some business establishments in nearby municipalities provide financial assistance to these farmers, which make farmers gravitate toward these other centers. To cater to the <b>personal</b> <b>needs</b> of the local residents, there are a number of business activities, which provide such services as photo supplies, beauty parlors and video rentals.|$|E

25|$|The {{ability to}} live {{independently}} with CP varies widely, depending {{partly on the}} severity of each person's impairment and partly on the capability of each person to self-manage the logistics of life. Some individuals with CP require personal assistant services for all activities of daily living.

40|$|An {{important}} part of understanding leader empowering behavior is to establish its determinants. By understanding its determinants, leaders can become aware of what may influence their behavior, both unconsciously and consciously. This study therefore explores leader empowering behavior in relation to such assumed determinants {{in order to test}} if they have an impact on exercising leader empowering behavior. Our chosen determinants for this study are related to empowerment in both new ways and in old ways. The new angle is to look into similarity in personality characteristics, and more specifically <b>personal</b> <b>need</b> for structure. The old angle is linking trust to empowerment, which have been done in several previous studies. However, we have chosen to follow a more recent approach and look at leader’s trust in subordinates as a determinant. We propose that personality similarity in <b>personal</b> <b>need</b> for structure will lead to more trust in subordinates, and that higher trust again will influence leader empowering behavior. We justify this approach by previous researchers’ findings that personality similarities lead to more trust, and from indications that trust between leader and subordinate is likely to lead to leader empowering behavior. We further intend to establish if there is a direct relationship between personality similarities and leader empowering behavior, hence a direct relationship between similarity in <b>personal</b> <b>need</b> for structure and leader empowering behavior. Contrary to our expectations, and previous research supporting a positive influence of similarity in individual differences, leader-subordinate congruence in <b>personal</b> <b>need</b> for structure did not influence trust nor leader empowering behavior. Rather, our findings reveal that subordinates’ levels of <b>personal</b> <b>need</b> for structure appear {{to play an important role}} for leaders’ trust in subordinates, however not in relation to the display of leader empowering behavior. An elaborative discussion of our findings is shared along with possible limitations and directions for further research...|$|R

25|$|Hinduism has {{incorporated}} {{many kinds}} of prayer (Sanskrit: prārthanā), from fire-based rituals to philosophical musings. While chanting involves 'by dictum' recitation of timeless verses or verses with timings and notations, dhyanam involves deep meditation (however short or long) on the preferred deity/God. Again the object to which prayers are offered could be a persons referred as devtas, trinity or incarnation of either devtas or trinity or simply plain formless meditation as practiced by the ancient sages. These prayers can be directed to fulfilling <b>personal</b> <b>needs</b> or deep spiritual enlightenment, and also {{for the benefit of}} others. Ritual invocation was {{part and parcel of the}} Vedic religion and as such permeated their sacred texts. Indeed, the highest sacred texts of the Hindus, the Vedas, are a large collection of mantras and prayer rituals. Classical Hinduism came to focus on extolling a single supreme force, Brahman, that is made manifest in several lower forms as the familiar gods of the Hindu pantheon. Hindus in India have numerous devotional movements. Hindus may pray to the highest absolute God Brahman, or more commonly to Its three manifestations namely creator god called Brahma, preserver god called Vishnu and destroyer god (so that the creation cycle can start afresh) Shiva, and at the next level to Vishnu's avatars (earthly appearances) Rama and Krishna or to many other male or female deities. Typically, Hindus pray with their hands (the palms) joined together in pranam. The hand gesture is similar to the popular Indian greeting namaste.|$|E
