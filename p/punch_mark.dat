50|$|Nathaniel Mills the Elder (1746-1843) was {{a partner}} in Mills & Langston, Northwood Jewellers when he {{registered}} his first mark in 1803. In 1825, he registered his well-known now <b>punch</b> <b>mark</b> 'N.M' within a rectangle at the Birmingham Assay Office and concentrated on working with silver on his own. Mills contributed to popularization of the so-called castle-top silver vinaigrettes and visiting card cases engraved with British landmarks and sold as souvenirs to tourists; {{he became one of}} the most prolific Birmingham box makers at the time introducing different designs.|$|E
5000|$|The silver stater with a Turtle is a coin {{from the}} 6th century BC Greece. The front has a sea turtle design, while the back has a <b>punch</b> <b>mark,</b> found on most coins at that time. The {{earliest}} coins {{were made of}} electrum, a mix of gold and silver. The coins were first made in the island of Aegina off the south east side of Greece. Some historical sources say the first coins {{were made by the}} king off Argos, Pheidon. The coins with 'turtle' design are considered [...] "an important early trading currency".|$|E
50|$|Kadambas coins {{were one}} the {{heaviest}} and perhaps purest of all medieval Indian gold coinage. Kadambas issued 2 types of gold coins, namely Punch-marked gold coins and Die struck gold coins. During 1075-1094 CE, Shanti Varma, issued gold <b>punch</b> <b>marked</b> coinand in 1065 CE, Toyimadeva, issued die struck gold coins (Pagoda).|$|R

50|$|Nagari is {{a village}} {{situated}} 18 km north of Chittorgarh in Rajasthan state in India. Its ancient name was Madhyamika. It was a flourishing town from the Mauryan period up to Gupta period. The old remains {{discovered in the}} excavations prove that. A large number of <b>punch</b> <b>marked</b> and other old coins have been discovered here.|$|R
50|$|A strong {{underlying}} {{layer of}} Dravidian population and culture survives in Maldivian society, {{with a clear}} Tamil-Malayalam substratum in the language, which also appears in place names, kinship terms, poetry, dance, and religious beliefs. Malabari seafaring culture led to Malayali settling of the Laccadives, and the Maldives were evidently viewed {{as an extension of}} that archipelago. Some argue (from the presence of Jat, Gujjar Titles and Gotra names) that Sindhis also accounted for an early layer of migration. Seafaring from Debal began during the Indus valley civilisation. The Jatakas and Puranas show abundant evidence of this maritime trade; the use of similar traditional boat building techniques in Northwestern South Asia and the Maldives, and the presence of silver <b>punch</b> <b>mark</b> coins from both regions, gives additional weight to this. There are minor signs of Southeast Asian settlers, probably some adrift from the main group of Austronesian reed boat migrants that settled Madagascar.|$|E
5000|$|In 1880 the South Australia Police, {{who were}} then {{interested}} in re-arming with up-to-date weapons, noted {{a display of}} New Model Number Three revolvers at the Australian Exposition in Melbourne. At the direction of Police Commissioner Peterswald an order was placed through S&W's New York agent for 250 nickel revolvers in [...]44 Russian with a seven-inch barrel length. The order, which included extension shoulder stocks, ammunition, and reloading kits, arrived at Adelaide in March 1882. The revolvers and stocks were thereupon marked with a government broad arrow <b>punch</b> <b>mark,</b> and were called revolver-carbines. They were issued to mounted police, known as troopers, who at that period also policed the Northern Territory. Both the South Australia and Western Australia police made further small purchases during 1886-88, none of which was marked with the broad arrow. For some thirty years the revolver-carbine was the front line weapon of the mounted police of S.A., W.A., and N.T. Nearly all serial numbers are known, and {{are listed in the}} book Service Arms of the South Australian Police. The S.A. revolvers were sold as surplus in 1953 to the Western Arms Corporation of Los Angeles.|$|E

Observations reported on include: specimen preparation and dimensional measurement; modifications to the standard ASTM E 399 displacement gage, which permit <b>punch</b> <b>mark</b> gage point engagement; and a measurement device for determining the interior and exterior radii of ring segments. Load displacement ratios were determined experimentally which agreed with analytically determined coefficients for three different gage lengths on the inner surfaces of radially-cracked ring segments...|$|E

50|$|Coins: Silver <b>punch</b> <b>marked</b> coins are datable to {{a period}} between the 4th century BC and the 1st-2nd century AD. Some uninscribed copper cast coins have been found. Two Gupta period coins have been {{reported}} from a nearby village named Vamanpara. A number of coins belonging to the sultans of 14th-15th century and British East India Company have been found.|$|R
40|$|Scientific {{analyses}} of objects from Sösdala I are presented. <b>Punch</b> <b>marks</b> on 57 gilt silver mounts were examined under microscope, revealing {{a high quality}} of craftsmanship. In all, 27 different punched motifs have been described. By comparative studies, objects with <b>punch</b> <b>marks</b> made by the same tools have been identified. By interlinking the objects, three different sets of tools have been identified, plausibly representing three different craftsmen/workshops. One pendant is a loner of lower quality and probably a replacement. Trial <b>marks</b> are <b>punched</b> {{on the back of}} some objects and on others motifs are sketched. Analyses of a sample of 12 silver mounts revealed that the alloy consisted of 85 - 95 % silver. Some alloy variations support the grouping based on punch analysis. One object with niello inlays was mapped with SEM/EDS. The niello was shown to consist of pure silver sulphide according to Roman tradition, indicating the manufacturing date to {{before the end of the}} 5 th century AD...|$|R

50|$|The Mauryan coins were <b>punch</b> <b>marked</b> {{with the}} royal {{standard}} to ascertain their authenticity. The Arthashastra, written by Kautilya, mentions minting of coins but {{also indicates that}} the violation of the Imperial Maurya standards by private enterprises {{may have been an}} offence. Kautilya also seemed to advocate a theory of bimetallism for coinage, which involved the use of two metals, copper and silver, under one government.|$|R
