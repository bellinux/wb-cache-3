5|$|Weaver ant (Oecophylla spp.) workers build nests {{in trees}} by {{attaching}} leaves together, first <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> together with bridges {{of workers and}} then inducing their larvae to produce silk as they are moved along the leaf edges. Similar forms of nest construction are seen in some species of Polyrhachis.|$|E
5|$|The Texas {{pocket gopher}} avoids {{emerging}} {{onto the surface}} to feed by seizing the roots of plants with its jaws and <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> downwards into its burrow. It also practices coprophagy. The African pouched rat forages on the surface, gathering anything that might be edible into its capacious cheek pouches until its face bulges out sideways. It then returns to its burrow to sort through the material it has gathered and eats the nutritious items.|$|E

5|$|The American robin's diet {{generally}} {{consists of}} around 40 percent small invertebrates (mainly insects), such as earthworms, beetle grubs, caterpillars and grasshoppers, and 60 percent wild and cultivated fruits and berries. Their ability {{to switch to}} berries allows them to winter much farther north than most other North American thrushes. They will flock to fermented Pyracantha berries, and after eating sufficient quantities will exhibit intoxicated behavior such as falling over while walking. Robins forage primarily {{on the ground for}} soft-bodied invertebrates, and find worms by sight (and sometimes by hearing), pouncing on them and then <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> up. Nestlings are fed mainly on worms and other soft-bodied animal prey. In some areas, robins, particularly of the coastal race T. m. caurinus, will feed on beaches, taking insects and small mollusks.|$|E
5|$|The Epiriotes {{launched}} their first assault {{against the city}} at daybreak. However, {{they were unable to}} get a firm footing because of the trench and were repulsed by the defenders, who were encouraged by the women. In order to circumvent this obstacle. Pyrrhus ordered a 2,000 picked force of Gauls and Chaonians commanded by Ptolemy to attempt to go around the trench. Finding their path blocked by the wagons, they began to <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> out of the ground. Aware of the danger, Acrotatus used a series of depressions to attack this force from the rear and managed to the push the Epiriote flanking group into the trench after inflicting heavy casualties upon them. Unable to make an impact on the defences, Pyrrhus ordered his troops to withdraw to their camp at nightfall.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{analysis of}} imaging, mass spectrometry, and magnetospheric data {{suggests that the}} observed south polar plume emanates from pressurized subsurface chambers, similar to Earth's geysers,. The mechanism that drives and sustains the eruptions {{is thought to be}} tidal heating. The intensity of the eruption of the south polar jets varies significantly {{as a function of the}} position of Enceladus in its orbit. The plumes are about four times brighter when Enceladus is at apoapsis (the point in its orbit most distant from Saturn) than when it is at periapsis. This is consistent with geophysical calculations which predict the south polar fissures are under compression near periapsis, pushing them shut, and under tension near apoapsis, <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> open.|$|E

25|$|Fusion {{reactions}} {{occur when}} {{two or more}} atomic nuclei come close enough for long enough that the nuclear force <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> together exceeds the electrostatic force pushing them apart, fusing them into heavier nuclei. For nuclei lighter than iron-56, the reaction is exothermic, releasing energy. For nuclei heavier than iron-56, the reaction is endothermic, requiring an external source of energy. Hence, nuclei smaller than iron-56 {{are more likely to}} fuse while those heavier than iron-56 are more likely to break apart.|$|E

25|$|The Russian {{partition}} of Poland experienced considerable industrialization, particularly the textile capital of Łódź, then the Manchester of Imperial Russia. Russia's policies were pro-foreign immigration, whereas German Poland was unambiguously anti-immigrant. Polish laborers {{were encouraged to}} migrate for work in the iron-foundries of Piotrków Trybunalski and migrants were highly desired in Siberian towns. Russia also established a Peasant Bank to promote land ownership for its peasant population, and many Poles were given employment opportunities <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> from rural areas into industrial Russian cities. Of the three partitions, the Russian one contained the most middle-class Polish workers, {{and the number of}} industrial workers overall between 1864 and 1890 increased from 80,000 to 150,000. Łódź experienced a booming economy, as the Russian Empire consumed about 70% of its textile production.|$|E

Driscoll continues to shadow Kong and Ann while Denham returns to the village for more men. Upon arriving in Kong's lair in a mountain cave, Ann is menaced by a snake-like Elasmosaurus, which Kong wrestles and kills. While Kong is distracted killing a Pteranodon that tried to fly away with Ann, Driscoll reaches her and they climb down a vine dangling from a cliff ledge. When Kong notices and starts <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> back up, they let go and fall unharmed into the water below.

25|$|In 1947, McQueen {{joined the}} United States Marine Corps and was {{promoted}} to private first class and assigned to an armored unit. Initially he reverted to his prior rebelliousness and was demoted to private seven times. He took an unauthorized absence by failing to return after a weekend pass expired, staying with a girlfriend for two weeks until the shore patrol caught him. He resisted arrest and spent 41 days in the brig. After this he resolved to focus his energies on self-improvement and embraced the Marines' discipline. He saved the lives of five other Marines during an Arctic exercise, <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> from a tank before it broke through ice into the sea. He {{was assigned to the}} honor guard, responsible for guarding then US President Harry Truman's yacht. McQueen served until 1950, when he was honorably discharged.

25|$|Sheriff Bill Presley and his deputies have a {{difficult}} task ahead of them {{as they attempt to}} solve the shocking double murder discovered Sunday morning. Texarkana residents can help in this investigation {{and at the same time}} if they are not careful, they can hinder the investigation and cause the officers to spend many hours following blind trails. Persons who have information which might furnish a clue to the identity of the slayer or slayers or which might indicate a motive for the crime should not divulge such information on street corners or at cold drink stands but should immediately make it available to the officers. Do not spread rumors regardless of how much basis for fact there is in them. Do not say 'I heard' or 'they say', because the chances are that the person listening will repeat your information and enlarge upon it. Before long the story grows to such proportions as to necessitate a detailed investigation by the officers, thereby perhaps <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> off the true trail and sending them up a blind alley. Stick to facts that you know of your own personal knowledge and relay those facts as quickly as possible to the officers.|$|E
25|$|This {{was used}} when {{the best results}} were wanted from long fibred wools and hairs such as mohair, alpaca, long English and {{crossbred}} wools. In the Lister comb, the slivers of wool or hair are fed into the machine over the back plate, through the fluted feed rollers, under the spreader roller and onto the pins of the fallers which disentangle and transport the fibres to the nip jaw. The nip jaw, with its swinging motion, closes in upon the fringe of fibres, grasping them and <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> out from the faller pins; thus partially combing the fibres which are then received by the carrier comb and conveyed to the pins of the large combing circle into which they are pressed by the dabbing brush. As the large circle rotates, the unique feature of the machine, the side circle comb gives the fibres a secondary combing, removing not the short fibres, but any excessively long ones. The large comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off rollers which give the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the circle pins, with the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the crimping box and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils are removed from the pins of the large comb circle by lifting knives, and deposited into a can ready for removal.|$|E

25|$|In September 2011, Christiansen {{once again}} {{competed in the}} Junior Norwegian Summer Championships, in the age group for 20- and 21-year-olds. He came eighth in the sprint, but climbed to claim gold in the pursuit. In January 2012, Christiansen debuted in the Junior European Championships in Brezno-Osrblie. In the first event, the 10km sprint on 27 January, he missed once, but still won gold, just one second ahead of Alexandr Loginov. Two days later, Christiansen won silver in the 12.5km pursuit, 23.5 seconds behind Loginov, despite both having missed twice. The next event was the mixed relay in which Christiansen took the anchor leg. The Norwegians led at the last {{exchange}} and as Christiansen needed only two spare rounds to clear the targets, they won gold. He also participated in the last event, the 15km individual. He missed twice, but still won bronze, thanks to quick ski speed. Christiansen competed in the Junior/Youth World Championships in 2012 as well, this time in Kontiolahti, competing in the junior category. The first event was the 15km individual on 21 February. He skied quickly, but missed six times and finished 16th. Two days later, Christiansen raced in the relay, once again taking the anchor leg. The Norwegian team led the race at the last exchange and Christiansen defended their lead, and the Norwegians won gold. The next race, two days later, was the 10km sprint. Christiansen missed twice and finished 13th. Christiansen skied better in the pursuit the following day, where he missed twice, but climbed eleven places to win silver just ahead of Alexandr Loginov, and over one minute and forty seconds behind the sprint winner Tsvetkov. In March, Christiansen raced in the Junior Norwegian Championships, winning silver in the individual and gold in the sprint, and finishing fourth in the relay. At the season's end, Christiansen participated in the Norwegian Championships in Trondheim. He came 13th in the 20km individual and 9th in the 10km sprint, but skipped the mass start. He then took the anchor leg in the relay. Andresen, Tommi Luchsinger and Erlend Bjøntegaard had pulled Buskerud I into fourth position, and Christiansen was the fastest in his leg, <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> into second, winning silver.|$|E
500|$|Doug Jones and {{the other}} actors who played The Gentlemen had {{previous}} experience performing as monsters and were professional mimes as well. This gave them an elegant grace, especially in their hand movements.

500|$|The force acts on the charged {{particles}} themselves, hence charge {{has a tendency}} to spread itself as evenly as possible over a conducting surface. The magnitude of the electromagnetic force, whether attractive or repulsive, is given by Coulomb's law, which relates the force to the product of the charges and has an inverse-square relation to the distance between them. [...] The electromagnetic force is very strong, second only in strength to the strong interaction, but unlike that force it operates over all distances. In comparison with the much weaker gravitational force, the electromagnetic force pushing two electrons apart is 1042 times that of the gravitational attraction <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> together.|$|E
