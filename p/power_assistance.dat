25|$|Large {{vehicles}} are usually fitted with power operated or power assisted parking brakes. Power assisted parking brakes are usually found on large vans {{as well as}} some older heavy vehicles. These operate {{in the same way as}} a conventional parking brakes, but pulling the lever operates a valve that allows air or hydraulic pressure or vacuum into a cylinder which applies force to the brake shoes and makes applying the parking brake easier. When releasing the parking brake, the same mechanism also provides assistance to the driver in disengaging the ratchet. Particularly on commercial vehicles with air operated brakes, this has the added benefit of making it much harder or even impossible to release the parking brake when insufficient air pressure is available to operate the brakes. A reservoir or accumulator is usually provided so a limited amount of <b>power</b> <b>assistance</b> is available with the engine off.|$|E

2500|$|The actual {{engraving}} {{is traditionally}} {{done by a}} combination of pressure and manipulating the work-piece. The traditional [...] "hand push" [...] process is still practiced today, but modern technology has brought various mechanically assisted engraving systems. Most pneumatic engraving systems require an air source that drives air through a hose into a handpiece, which resembles a traditional engraving handle in many cases, that powers a mechanism (usually a piston). The air is actuated by either a foot control (like a gas pedal or sewing machine) or newer palm / hand control. This mechanism replaces either the [...] "hand push" [...] effort or the effects of a hammer. The internal mechanisms move at speeds up to 15,000 strokes per minute, thereby greatly reducing the effort needed in traditional hand engraving. These types of pneumatic systems are used for <b>power</b> <b>assistance</b> only and do not guide or control the engraving artist. One of the major benefits of using a pneumatic system for hand engraving is the reduction of fatigue and decrease in time spent working.|$|E

5000|$|Power steering. Older {{hydraulic}} power steering systems are powered by a hydraulic pump constantly engaged to the engine. <b>Power</b> <b>assistance</b> required for steering is inversely proportional to the vehicle speed so the constant load on the engine from a hydraulic pump reduces fuel efficiency. More modern designs improve fuel efficiency by only activating the <b>power</b> <b>assistance</b> when needed; this is done by using either direct electrical power steering assistance or an electrically powered hydraulic pump.|$|E

40|$|In many {{everyday}} tasks {{two people}} interact through force and motion. Examples include lifting and positioning a bulky object, teaching manual skills, dancing, and handing off a baton or a drinking glass. These tasks involve a communication channel {{between two people}} distinct from spoken language and gestures, yet still containing information. Understanding how two humans communicate and cooperate physically is important in dual-control situations, for robots that provide <b>powered</b> <b>assistance</b> in human-human tasks (such as physical therapy) and in designing a robot that physically interacts with humans. In this thesis, I describe my experiments on two subjects cooperating on a 1 degree of freedom task. I characterize the interaction forces between the two subjects, dividing them into a productive “net force ” and a conflicting “difference force”. I show that many individuals can be faster as a dyad than they can be individually. My results suggest that dyads can develop a specialization into different roles. iii Acknowledgement...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{two cases}} of exoskeletal platform, embedding a properly-designed element working both as power-Transmission and torque-sensing unit. This element {{belongs to the}} Series-Elastic-Actuator (SEA) category, as it provides a mechanical stiffness in-series with the active motor, and provides measurement of the torque by means of its deflection. This allows presented exoskeletons to realize an intrinsically safe (as for the compliance) and controllable (both in position and torque) interaction with the user. The two cases respectively deal with upper-limb post-stroke rehabilitation and <b>powered</b> <b>assistance</b> for the lower-limbs. The former exoskeleton-namely NEUROExos-was used by therapists to record experimental torque-Angle profiles from desired rehabilitative sessions on the subject's impaired limb, {{in order to assess}} quantitatively the current joint resistance and evaluate patient's progression. The latter exoskeleton-namely APO-allowed the implementation of a torque control for gait assistance. Both systems, despite being rather powerful and in close contact with the human body, embeds safety checks and features, which allow them to safely operate in physical contact with the user, without the risk to harm him/her...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to introduce a manual powered option that enables the disabled person to utilize arm motions to initiate the vehicle wheelchair lift giving both exercise and more personal control over the equipment. The purpose of this project is to provide an alternative way for the disabled person to get into his/her vehicle without having to rely on any electrically <b>powered</b> <b>assistance.</b> It has been the author's intent to modify the existing vehicle wheelchair lift to incorporate a new drive system that would allow for functional manual use. A hydraulic drive system {{has been designed to}} be installed onto the existing lift structure. The author will go further in depth with the hydraulic analysis, as {{the other members of the}} group will focus on other subcomponents of the lift. Necessary design parameters and constraints were given on this project, which limited various options on the choice of drive systems. Extensive design analysis and testing has been performed to achieve the most functional and practical solution to the manual wheelchair lift...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a system}} for arm rehabilitation for children with upper-limb hemiplegia resulting from cerebral palsy. Our research team designed a two-player, interactive (competitive or collaborative) computer play therapy system that provided <b>powered</b> <b>assistance</b> to children while they played specially designed games that promoted arm exercises. We designed the system for a school environment. To assess the feasibility of deploying the system in a school environment, the research team {{enlisted the help of}} teachers and staff in nine schools. Once the system was set up, it was used to deliver therapy without supervision from the research team. Ultimately, the system was found to be suitable for use in schools. However, the overriding need for schools to focus on academic activities meant that children could not use the system enough to achieve the amount of use desired for therapeutic benefit. In this paper, we identify the key challenges encountered during this study. For example, there was a marked reluctance to report system issues (which could have been fixed) that prevented children from using the system. We also discuss future implications of deploying similar studies with this type of system...|$|R

50|$|A deadlift suit is {{a special}} piece of <b>power</b> lifting <b>assistance</b> clothing. The suits are made from very tight {{material}}.

Wrist wraps are sometimes used to provide support, not necessarily to increase lift, like a suit.|$|R
