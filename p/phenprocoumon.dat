25|$|Vitamin K is an {{essential}} factor to a hepatic gamma-glutamyl carboxylase that adds a carboxyl group to glutamic acid residues on factors II, VII, IX and X, as well as Protein S, Protein C and Protein Z.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Vitamin K antagonists of the {{coumarin}} type {{are widely}} used oral anticoagulants. OBJECTIVE: We developed a transition algorithm for the maintenance dosages of three frequently used coumarins: warfarin, <b>phenprocoumon</b> and acenocoumarol. METHODS: The study was conducted at the Leiden Anticoagulation Clinic. Patients were participants in a trial of which the main objective was to compare the quality of an oral anticoagulant therapy with <b>phenprocoumon</b> to warfarin. We included patients who initiated oral anticoagulant therapy and patients who were already using acenocoumarol. Patients were randomized to a treatment with warfarin or <b>phenprocoumon.</b> Patients who were randomized to warfarin switched to <b>phenprocoumon</b> {{at the end of}} follow-up. We analysed the switch from acenocoumarol to warfarin or <b>phenprocoumon</b> at the start of follow-up and the switch of warfarin to <b>phenprocoumon</b> at the end of follow-up and calculated the transition factors for stable anticoagulation between these three vitamin K antagonists. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients switched from warfarin to <b>phenprocoumon,</b> 39 from acenocoumarol to <b>phenprocoumon</b> and 44 from acenocoumarol to warfarin. The maintenance dose of warfarin was 0. 41 (95 %CI 0. 39 - 0. 43) times the maintenance dose of <b>phenprocoumon.</b> The transition factor between acenocoumarol and <b>phenprocoumon</b> was 0. 84 (95 %CI 0. 79 - 0. 89) and between acenocoumarol and warfarin 1. 85 (95 %CI 1. 78 - 1. 92). CONCLUSIONS: We determined the transition factors between warfarin, <b>phenprocoumon</b> and acenocoumarol.

40|$|A 78 -year-old man {{was treated}} with {{coumarin}} derivatives following myocardial infarction. The international normalised ratio was not increased by using standard loading doses and dose adjustments for acenocoumarol and <b>phenprocoumon.</b> The desired level of anticoagulation was achieved with a high dosage of <b>phenprocoumon</b> (18 - 21 mg daily). This dose {{was associated with a}} <b>phenprocoumon</b> serum concentration that was ten times higher than the normal therapeutic concentration. The serum concentration of vitamin K 1 was low. After exclusion of alternative causes, we concluded that the exceptionally high dose of <b>phenprocoumon</b> needed was due to partial resistance to coumarin derivatives. Partial resistance is related to a polymorphism of the gene coding for the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase. The patient was successfully treated with chronic high-dose <b>phenprocoumon.</b> Resistance to coumarin derivatives caused by a congenital polymorphism in the vitamin K reductase gene is a rare phenomenon. Resistance is seldom absolute. The desired anticoagulation effect can be achieved with doses that are 10 - 20 times higher than standard doses. <b>Phenprocoumon</b> is advantageous in this situation because it requires fewer tablets than acenocoumarol. Determination of serum concentrations of acenocoumarol and <b>phenprocoumon</b> can be used to exclude other causes of treatment resistance...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWAS) on warfarin and acenocoumarol {{showed that}} interindividual dosage variation is mainly associated with {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNPs) in VKORC 1 {{and to a lesser}} extent in CYP 2 C 9 and CYP 4 F 2. For <b>phenprocoumon</b> dosage, the genes encoding CYP 3 A 4 and ApoE might play a role. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between common genetic variants within VKORC 1, CYP 2 C 9, CYP 4 F 2, CYP 3 A 4, and ApoE and <b>phenprocoumon</b> maintenance dosage, and to identify novel signals using GWAS. METHODS: We selected all participants from the Rotterdam study who were treated with <b>phenprocoumon.</b> For each SNP, we tested the association between the above-mentioned genotypes and age, sex, body mass index, and target INR adjusted-phenprocoumon maintenance dosage. RESULTS: Within our study population (N= 244), VKORC 1, CYP 2 C 9, CYP 4 F 2 genotypes together explained 46 % of <b>phenprocoumon</b> maintenance dosage variation. Each additional VKORC 1 variant allele reduced <b>phenprocoumon</b> maintenance dosage by 4. 8 mg/week (P< 0. 0001) and each additional CYP 2 C 9 variant allele by 2. 2 mg/week (P= 0. 002). Each additional variant allele of CYP 4 F 2 increased <b>phenprocoumon</b> dosage by 1. 5 mg/week (P= 0. 022). Variant alleles of CYP 3 A 41 *B and ApoE showed no association with <b>phenprocoumon</b> dosage. Genome-wide significant SNPs were all related to VKORC 1 activity. Best associated were two SNPs in complete linkage disequilibrium with each other and with SNPs within VKORC 1 : rs 10871454 [Syntaxin 4 A (STX 4 A) ] and rs 11150604 (ZNF 646), each with a P value of 2. 1 x 10 (2) (2). Each reduced <b>phenprocoumon</b> maintenance dosage weekly by 4. 9 mg per variant allele. CONCLUSION: Similar to earlier findings with warfarin and acenocoumarol, <b>phenprocoumon</b> maintenance dosage depended on polymorphisms in the VKORC 1 gene.

40|$|Treatment with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) {{has to be}} {{interrupted}} when invasive procedures are planned. We compared various methods of interruption in patients on acenocoumarol or <b>phenprocoumon</b> in a prospective study. In patients on acenocoumarol (n = 141), 99 stopped {{three days before the}} intervention and 42 stopped two days before. All patients on <b>phenprocoumon</b> (n = 111) received vitamin K two days before the intervention, and 55 of these patients discontinued <b>phenprocoumon,</b> whereas 56 did not stop. In a subset of 30 patients we determined International Normalized Ratios (INRs) and coagulation factors II, VII, X and protein C. The mean INR after stopping acenocoumarol for three days was significantly lower than after two days (1. 1 vs. 1. 3, p = < 0. 0001), but its clinical relevance may be trivial. In patients using <b>phenprocoumon,</b> the mean INR {{on the day of the}} intervention was only slightly lower after stopping the VKAs (1. 5 vs. 1. 6, p = 0. 0407), but a similar proportion of patients had an INR <or= 1. 4. On the day of the intervention, in the acenocoumarol group mean plasma levels of all coagulation factors were higher than 50 % and in the <b>phenprocoumon</b> group higher than 25 %. We conclude that acenocoumarol can be stopped two days before an invasive procedure that is associated with a low or moderate bleeding risk and three days before an intervention with a higher bleeding risk.

The Children Anticoagulation and Pharmacogenetics Study (CAPS) was designed as a multicenter retrospective follow-up study. Patients, who used acenocoumarol or <b>phenprocoumon</b> at an age of ≤ 18 years, were selected in four pediatric hospitals and one anticoagulation clinic in the Netherlands.

40|$|Background: Oral {{anticoagulants}} {{like the}} coumarin derivatives are characterised by a particularly narrow therapeutic range.

40|$|<b>Phenprocoumon</b> is {{the second}} most {{commonly}} used oral anticoagulant worldwide and the most common agent in many European countries including Switzerland. Given its long half-life of about one week, an initial loading-dose is generally applied. A high loading-dose is helpful to rapidly reach a therapeutic concentration but may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding if the effect overshoots. <b>Phenprocoumon</b> has a narrow therapeutic range, and individual dose requirements are highly variable. In clinical practice the initial dose-finding process for <b>phenprocoumon</b> is largely empiric and often delegated to inexperienced staff members. Thus, both a prolonged loading phase and overshooting of anticoagulation is commonly observed. Question under study The general aim of the thesis was to define one or more algorithms for the loading phase of phenprocoumon-treatment. These algorithms should be easily applicable in a clinical setting and help to improve the drug safety of <b>phenprocoumon</b> especially during the initial dose-finding process. Retrospective study In a retrospective study, predictors of individual dosing needs for a target-INR of 2. 0 to 3. 0 in medical and orthopaedic inpatients were determined. Several significant predictors of the loading dose could be identified. Using these predictors two simple clinical algorithms for the initial dosing of <b>phenprocoumon</b> in medical and orthopedic inpatients were developed. One algorithm contains clinical data and, additionally, serum albumin; the second algorithm contains clinical data only. Prospective study The aim of the prospective, randomized interventional study was to validate the efficacy and safety of the two previously proposed dosing algorithms for the initiation of oral anticoagulation with <b>phenprocoumon.</b> Additionally, the predictive value of pharmacogenetic markers was to be studied. Both algorithms could be validated and were slightly optimized. They proved to be very safe and effective in hospitalized patients with a high rate of comorbidity. The algorithm using clinical data can be especially recommended due to its simplicity of use. ...|$|E

40|$|Coumarin oral {{anticoagulant}} drugs {{have proven to}} be effective for the prevention of thromboembolic events. World-wide,warfarin is the most prescribed drug. In Europe, acenocoumarol and <b>phenprocoumon</b> are also administered. Yet it has been proven that variant alleles of the VKORC 1 and CYP 2 C 9 genotypes influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these drugs. The combination of these two variant genotypes is a major cause of the inter-individual differences in coumarin anticoagulant drug dosage. Individuals who test positive for both variant genotypes are at increased risk of major bleeding. The impact of the CYP 2 C 9 and VKORC 1 genotype is most significant during the initial period of coumarin anticoagulant therapy. The effect of VKORC 1 allelic variants is relatively similar for all three VKAs. The CYP 2 C 9 polymorphism is associated with delayed stabilisation for coumarin anticoagulants. The effects of CYP 2 C 9 polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics and anticoagulant response are least pronounced in the case of <b>phenprocoumon.</b> In the long term, patients using <b>phenprocoumon</b> have more often international normalised ratio (INR) values in the therapeutic range, requiring fewer monitoring visits. This leads us to conclude that in the absence of pharmacogenetic testing, <b>phenprocoumon</b> seems preferable for use in long-term therapeutic anticoagulation.

40|$|<b>Phenprocoumon</b> is {{extracted}} from acidified plasma, the organic phase evaporated, {{and part of}} the residue, in ethanol, is quantitatively applied to a thin-layer plate. After separation, the quantity of <b>phenprocoumon</b> is assayed by fluorescencedensitometry in situ. Results are reproducible to about 2. 5 %. The lower limit of detection is 0. 1 mg/liter, which makes the method fulty applicable to human plasma, because therapeutic concentrations range from 1 to 3 mg/liter. Seven determinations can be made within 3 h. For toxicological purposes, a qualitative analysis can be done in a shorter time, because the <b>phenprocoumon</b> spots are visible under ultraviolet light at 254 nm. The effect of coumarin anticoagulants is usually measured by determination of a biological variable such as prothrombin time. Although this test is easier to perform than the chemical assays used to determine the concentrations of these drugs in blood and may give more direct information on the dosage regimen, there are clinical situations in which information on coumarin concentrations themselves is of value: (a) for toxicological purposes, to find out whether a given coagulation disturbance is the result of coumarin intake; (b) to determine whether lack of anticoagulant effect is the result either of noncompliance by the patient, or of malabsorption of the drug, or of hereditary resistance to coumarin congeners; and (c) to study the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug, from information on concentrations in plasma. Most pharmacological work on coumarins has been done with warfarin and dicoumarol; only few phar-macokinetic data are available for another coumarin congener, <b>phenprocoumon</b> (“Liquamar, ” Organon; “Marcoumar, ” Hoffmann-La Roche).

40|$|The {{methods of}} {{computational}} chemistry {{have been used}} to elucidate the molecular properties of coumarinic anticoagulants (acenocoumarol, <b>phenprocoumon,</b> warfarin and tecarfarin) and direct thrombin inhibitors (melagatran, dabigatran and their prodrug forms, ximelagatran and dabigatran etexilate). The geometries and energies of these drugs have been computed at the Becke 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) level of theory. In the case of the vitamin K antagonists (acenocoumarol, <b>phenprocoumon,</b> warfarin and tecarfarin), the most stable tautomer in both the gas-phase and water solution is tautomer A, which contains the 4 -hydroxycoumarin moiety. The R(+) -enantiomer of this tautomer is the most stable structure in warfarin and acetocoumarol. For <b>phenprocoumon,</b> the S(-) -enantiomer was the most stable species. The computed dissociation constants show that these drugs are almost completely ionized at physiological pH = 7. 4. Tecarfarin is the vitamin K antagonist with the highest lipophilicity. The prodrugs ximelagatran and dabigatran etexilate are described as lipophilic drugs. The prodrugs' metabolites, melagatran and dabigatran, are substantially less lipophilic. The relatively high polar surface area value of acenocoumarol (113. 3) results in lessened absorption in comparison with warfarin. <b>Phenprocoumon,</b> with PSA value 50. 4, had the highest calculated absorption of all of the anticoagulants in the study.

Results: Fifty-four patients were included who had a first prescription of acetaminophen in their pharmacy record (during oral anticoagulant use) and twenty patients with a first prescription of a benzodiazepine (during oral anticoagulant use). The INR (International Normalized Ratio) difference before and after acetaminophen use was not statistically significant between the two groups and showed no dose dependency. Conclusion: These data do not demonstrate that acetaminophen, in the dosages used in everyday practice, has a clinically relevant influence on the INR in patients using acenocoumarol or <b>phenprocoumon...</b>|$|E
40|$|Twenty-four {{patients}} on long-term anti-coagulant treatment with phen procoumon {Marcoumar*-) {{took part in}} a study designed to investigate the possible interaction between <b>phenprocoumon</b> and Ibuprofen {Brufenf'). Prior to entry into the study, the anti-coagulant state of each patient was adequately controlled on a dose of <b>phenprocoumon</b> which remained un changed throughout the study. Under double-blind conditions, half {{of the total number of}} patients received Ibuprofen 600 mg a day in three divided doses for two weeks followed by two weeks without therapy; then two weeks of placebo, again followed by two weeks without therapy. The other patients received the drugs in the reverse order. The anti-coagulant state was measured using the Thrombotest, the results being expressed as a percentage of the normal. The results indicated that the effects of a fixed dose of <b>phenprocoumon,</b> as measured by the Thrombotest, did not alter significantly throughout the study, and no serious side-effects were noted. These findings suggest that in general, Ibuprofen can safely be given to patients receiving oral anti coagulants without the risk of interfering with their anti-coagulant state...|$|E
