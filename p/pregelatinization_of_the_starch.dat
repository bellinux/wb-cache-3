40|$|Commercial starch pearls {{manufactured}} from sago, tapioca, {{sweet potato}} or other starches from Hong Kong, the Philippines and Singapore were characterized. Samples were milled and pasting properties were evaluated. There were marked differences in pasting characteristics which {{were attributed to}} <b>the</b> pH <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>starch</b> pearls. <b>The</b> milled alkaline <b>starch</b> pearls showed high cold paste viscosities and setback ratios while <b>the</b> acidic milled <b>starch</b> had low cold paste viscosities and setback ratios. Furthermore, in alkaline milled <b>starch,</b> <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> sugar drastically lowered the setback ratios while <b>the</b> setback ratios <b>of</b> <b>the</b> milled acidic <b>starches</b> were minimally affected. From <b>the</b> laboratory preparation <b>of</b> <b>starch</b> pearls from commercial tuber starches (potato and cassava), it appeared that <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> pearling effected a mild starch modification which increased <b>the</b> stability ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> milled <b>starch</b> pearl compared to <b>the</b> unprocessed <b>starch.</b> © 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Enset (Ensete ventricosum, Musaceae), a plant widely {{cultivated}} in south and southwest of Ethiopia, {{has been shown}} to be a rich source of starch. In an effort to produce directly compressible matrix-forming excipient, native enset starch was acetylated. Starch acetates (SA) with degrees of substitution (DS) of 0. 672 and 2. 142 were evaluated. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modified <b>starches</b> verified <b>the</b> acetylation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>starch</b> molecules. Further investigations revealed that acetylation increased swelling power and solubility, improved flow property and compactability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>starch.</b> <b>The</b> tensile strength <b>of</b> SA matrix tablets increased with an increase in DS. Plain tablets of SA with DS 0. 672 disintegrated within 3 min while those of SA with DS 2. 142 did not disintegrate over a period of 2 h. Dissolution studies of theophylline loaded SA tablets conducted in 0. 1 N HCl for the first 1. 5 h and in phosphate buffer pH 6. 8 for the remaining study time revealed the change in drug release rate from rapid to sustained releas...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>The</b> moisture-dependent {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> a starch-based {{composite binder}} comprising of silica sand, starch and bond clay was investigated. This {{study shows that}} the mechanical properties- gas permeability, compressive strength, compatibility and shatter index were optimum at 12. 5 % moisture content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>starch</b> based composite binder...|$|R

Proximate composition and physical characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>starch</b> were analysed monthly. It was found that packing in either polyethylene bag or polyethylene bag covered with polypropylene bag gave better quality starch than packing in either gunny or polypropylene bags...|$|R
