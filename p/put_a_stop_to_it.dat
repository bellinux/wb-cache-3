5|$|Galland did {{not give}} up. He made {{repeated}} appeals for Me 262 fighter aircraft. Göring refused Galland's requests to have equal numbers of Me 262 fighter and bomber variants built. However, Galland's close relationship with Albert Speer, the German armaments minister, enabled him to retain a small operational number. Even this was difficult, as Hitler had taken personal control of turbo-jet production and checked where each batch of the aircraft were being deployed. It was not until September 1944 that Hitler rescinded his directive that the Me 262 {{be used as a}} fighter-bomber. Galland ignored the order and formed Eprobungskommando 262 to test the Me 262 against high-flying Allied reconnaissance aircraft. He selected the highly decorated pilot Werner Thierfelder as its commander. Hitler heard of the experiment through Milch and ordered Göring to <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> at a meeting on 29 May 1944. Galland persisted with the experiments and ordered operations to be continued. They achieved isolated successes until Thierfelder was shot down and killed by P-51 Mustangs on 18 July 1944. On 20 August, Hitler finally agreed to allow one in every 20 Me 262 to go into service with the Jagdwaffe which allowed Galland to build all–jet units.|$|E

25|$|After an {{adjournment}} {{of three}} weeks, Collingwood presented his summation on 12–16 December 1949. He said that perpetrators {{of war crimes}} could not be absolved of guilt by claiming that they were only following orders when such orders were unlawful under international law. He stated that it was immaterial whether or not Manstein {{was aware of the}} mass killings in his area; he should have known, and he should have tried to <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> He remarked that the testimony of Manstein's fellow soldiers was not corroborated by independent observers, and thus should not be relied upon too heavily. Regarding Manstein's use of the scorched earth tactic, Collingwood pointed out that it was not done out of any military necessity, but had been planned and ordered well in advance. The court adjourned until 19 December to consider the verdict.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} detect carbon dioxide leaks and the {{effectiveness}} of geological sequestration sites, different monitoring techniques can be employed to verify that the sequestered carbon stays trapped below the surface in the intended reservoir.

Along the journey the train stopped because of air raids throughout the day and night. The German guards made it clear they had disdain for the British airmen.

Joseph Goebbels, the Reich Propaganda Minister, had painted all British and Allied airmen as [...] "terror flyers" [...] and his message resonated with civilians.

It is not clear to what extent Matsui was aware of the atrocities perpetrated in Nanking. His former Chief of Staff in the SEA later testified that Matsui had been informed of [...] "a few cases of plunder and outrage" [...] shortly after entering the city, and Matsui's own field diary also mentions being told that Japanese troops had committed acts of rape and looting. Matsui commented in his field diary, [...] "The truth is that some such acts are unavoidable." [...] When a representative from the Japanese Foreign Ministry came to investigate the matter, Matsui admitted that some crimes had occurred and he blamed his subordinate commanders for allowing too many soldiers into the city in violation of his orders.

On the way, however, Archer reveals he is aware of Malory's plan and has been attempting to discourage Cyril from becoming a field agent, presumably due to his own feelings for Lana, and had orchestrated the whole fiasco to this end (revealing the prostitute was merely tranquilized). At this point, the car is rammed by a pursuing vehicle. [...] Cyril believes this is part of Archer's hoax, until their pursuer opens fire on them. In a true show of his character, Archer threatens to eject from the car and leave the hysterical Cyril behind. Their mystery attacker then ceases fire and reveals herself to be Lana, who has discovered Archer's assignment and decided to <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Despite Cyril's concern about being caught with a dead hooker, Lana reveals she is only upset he felt the need to keep secrets from her, so she punishes Cyril by forcing him to buy interracial pornography from [...] "the sweet old Korean lady" [...] at the video store. Archer releases the prostitute in the trunk after Cyril and Lana depart, who reveals she was not in on the plan. Archer is forced to not only pay her obscene amounts of money as collateral, but also give her his car, leaving him stranded.|$|E
500|$|Public {{nuisance}} concerns {{protecting the}} public, unlike private nuisance, which protects an individual. As such {{it is not}} only a tort but also a crime. In Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd, it was defined by Romer LJ as any act or omission [...] "which materially affects the reasonable comfort and convenience of life of a class of Her Majesty's subjects". Because of the wide definition given, there are a large range of issues which can be dealt with through public nuisance, including picketing on a road, as in Thomas v NUM, blocking a canal, as in Rose v Miles, or disrupting traffic by queuing in a road, as in Lyons v Gulliver. A significant difference between private and public nuisance is that under public, one can claim for personal injuries as well as damage to property. Another difference is that public nuisance is primarily a crime; it only becomes a tort if the claimant can prove that they suffered [...] "special damage" [...] over and above the effects on the other affected people in the [...] "class". The test for the required size of a [...] "class" [...] was also discussed in Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd, with the court concluding that the test was whether the nuisance was [...] "so widespread in its range or so indiscriminate in its effect {{that it would not be}} reasonable to expect one person to take proceedings on his own responsibility to <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> but that it should be taken on the responsibility of the community at large".|$|E

2500|$|Jason Francia, {{the son of}} {{a former}} Neverland maid, was the only alleged prior victim to testify. [...] Francia {{described}} three times he had been playing with Jackson: they were tickling each other, and Jackson ended up tickling Francia's [...] "little private region" [...] outside of his clothes for a few minutes each time, with Francia laughing all the while. Francia testified that the third time, Jackson had reached up the leg of Francia's shorts and touched his testicles. Francia claimed he needed five years of therapy because of the ordeal. [...] He received settlement money from Jackson, and testified that he thought he deserved even more. [...] Francia also admitted that he and his mother had sold stories of his alleged inappropriate tickling to the tabloids. When Jason Francia originally talked to the police after the 1993 allegations, he told them he had never been touched inappropriately.

2500|$|Chomsky first {{involved}} {{himself in}} active political protest against U.S. {{involvement in the}} Vietnam War in 1962, speaking on the subject at small gatherings in churches and homes. However, {{it was not until}} 1967 that he publicly entered the debate on United States foreign policy. In February he published a widely read essay in The New York Review of Books entitled [...] "The Responsibility of Intellectuals", in which he criticized the country's involvement in the conflict; the essay was based on an earlier talk that he had given to Harvard's Foundation for Jewish Campus Life. He expanded on his argument to produce his first political book, American Power and the New Mandarins, which was published in 1969 and soon established him at the forefront of American dissent. His other political books of the time included At War with Asia (1971), The Backroom Boys (1973), For Reasons of State (1973), and Peace in the Middle East? (1975), published by Pantheon Books. Coming {{to be associated with the}} American New Left movement, he nevertheless thought little of prominent New Left intellectuals Herbert Marcuse and Erich Fromm, and preferred the company of activists to intellectuals. Although The New York Review of Books did publish contributions from Chomsky and other leftists from 1967 to 1973, when an editorial change <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> he was virtually ignored by the rest of the mainstream press throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|One {{result of}} the {{narrowing}} of the East River along the shoreline of Manhattan and, later, Brooklyn [...] which continued until the mid-19th century when the state <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> [...] {{was an increase in}} the speed of its current. Buttermilk Channel, the strait that divides Governors Island from Red Hook in Brooklyn, and which is located directly south of the [...] "mouth" [...] of the East River, was in the early 17th century a fordable waterway across which cattle could be driven. [...] Further investigation by Colonel Jonathan Williams determined that the channel was by 1776 three fathoms deep (...) , five fathoms deep (...) in the same spot by 1798, and when surveyed by Williams in 1807 had deepened to 7 fathoms (...) at low tide. [...] What had been almost a bridge between two landforms which were once connected had become a fully navigable channel, thanks to the constriction of the East River and the increased flow it caused. Soon, the current in the East River had become so strong that larger ships had to use auxiliary steam power in order to turn. [...] The continued narrowing of the channel on both side may have been the reasoning behind the suggestion of one New York State Senator, who wanted to fill in the East River and annex Brooklyn, with the cost of doing so being covered byselling the newly made land. [...] Others proposed a dam at Roosevelt Island (then Blackwell's Island) to create a wet basin for shipping.|$|E
