40|$|Objectives Low-back and {{shoulder}} complaints {{were examined in}} relation to self-reported and objectively assessed exposure to work-related <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling. Methods Workers from several companies (eg, nursing homes and flower auctions) with <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling tasks and, as reference, workers without physically demanding tasks were invited to participate. Altogether 829 workers initially received a questionnaire, of whom 459 responded both initially and after I year of follow-up. Initially, self-reported exposure to <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling was assessed by questionnaire. Furthermore, {{a representative sample of}} 131 workers was observed at work using TRAC (task recording and analysis on computer) to assess exposure to <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling objectively. For exposure to <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling, the workers were classified into a reference group and medium and high exposure groups. Initially and in the follow-up, the 12 -month prevalence of low-back {{and shoulder}} complaints was assessed. Complaints reported in the follow-up were separately used as dependent variables to calculate prevalence rate ratios (PR) in a Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis. Results The adjusted PR values were not significant for low-back complaints. For shoulder complaints, both the medium and high exposure groups showed significant adjusted PR values for self-reported exposure and observed duration of <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling when compared with the reference group (PR range 2. 18 - 4. 86). For the observed frequency of <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling, only the medium exposure group showed a significant PR, of 3. 95. Conclusions The findings suggest a rather strong relationship between <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling and shoulder complaints.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to perform a comprehensive review of psychophysically determined maximum acceptable <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling forces. Factors affecting <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling forces are identified and discussed. Recent studies show a significant decrease (compared to previous studies) in maximum acceptable forces for males but not for females when <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling on a treadmill. A comparison of <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling forces measured using a high inertia cart with those measured on a treadmill shows that the <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling forces using high inertia cart are higher for males but are about the same for females. It is concluded that the recommendations of Snook and Ciriello (1991) for <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling forces are still valid and provide reasonable recommendations for ergonomics practitioners. Regression equations as a function of handle height, frequency of exertion and pushing/pulling distance are provided to estimate maximum initial and sustained forces for <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling acceptable to 75 % male and female workers. At present {{it is not clear whether}} pushing or pulling should be favored. Similarly, it is not clear what handle heights would be optimal for <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling. Epidemiological studies are needed to determine relationships between psychophysically determined maximum acceptable <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling forces and risk of musculoskeletal injuries, in particular to low back and shoulders.

5|$|The other {{possibility}} for Black {{is to keep}} his Bb4 as long as possible, exchanging it against the white knight only in favourable circumstances. A couple of attempts have been done with this in mind, with subtle variations along the moves a7–a5, b7–b6 and d7–d6. Against the mundane 10...d6 White can continue with 11.Nb3 (see diagram at right) {{to play on the}} queenside against the exposed Bb4, or 11.Nb1 to recycle the knight on the ideal d5-square. Another idea is the immediate 10...a5, to have the d6-square for the bishop, inhibit the b2–b4 <b>push</b> <b>and</b> have the possible a5–a4 pawn advance if the white knight moves to b3. In the game Mikhalevski–Chabanon (Bad Endbach 1995) Black kept the bishop with 11.Nb3 a4 12.a3Bd6 13.Nd4 Bc5 14.Nb5 d6 15.Nc3 Ng6 16.Bg3 f5 and had dynamic play.|$|E

More conceptually, the embedded stack is <b>pushed</b> <b>and</b> popped, the current stack is optionally pushed back onto the embedded stack, and any other stacks one would like are pushed on top of that, with the last stack being the one read from in the next iteration.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review paper {{is to provide a}} {{synopsis}} of the findings of papers on <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling; and to identify areas of contention which require further in depth analysis. It is evident from reviewing the published papers on <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling that {{there is a lack of}} consensus as to which one of these two actions has the greatest force production. The main problem is probably the lack of standardized methodology in push-pull research. Furthermore, even when similar methodologies have been used the description of postures adopted during testing by the subjects varies greatly from paper to paper. The various studies have employed different postures and also imposed different restrictions on the postures adopted during experimentation, making comparisons between findings difficult. Much emphasis has been placed on the evaluation of static <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling tasks, and there is a clear need for further research into dynamic <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling. Additionally to date the focus of much of this research has been on the biomechanical stresses placed on the body with little attention being given to the physiological cost of <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling...|$|R
5|$|Alarmed by {{the actions}} of the Temeraires crew, Campbell met with Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell the {{following}} day and informed him of the mutineers' demands. Mitchell reported the news to the Admiralty while Campbell returned to Temeraire and summoned the crew on deck once more. He urged them to return to duty, and then dismissed them. Meanwhile, discipline had begun to break down among the mutineers. Several of the crew became drunk, and some of the officers were struck by rowdy seamen. When one of the marines who supported the mutiny was placed in irons for drunken behaviour and insolence, a crowd formed on deck and tried to free him. The officers resisted these attempts and as sailors began to <b>push</b> <b>and</b> threaten them, Campbell gave the order for the marines to arrest those he identified as the ringleaders. The marines hesitated, but then obeyed the order, driving the unruly seamen back and arresting a number of them, who were immediately placed in irons. Campbell ordered the remaining crew to abandon any mutinous actions, and deprived of its leaders, the mutiny collapsed, though the officers were on their guard for several days afterwards and the marines were ordered to carry out continuous patrols.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} 19th century, the major {{shipping}} lines financed Swedish emigrant agents {{and paid for}} the production of large quantities of emigration propaganda. Much of this promotional material, such as leaflets, was produced by immigration promoters in the U.S. Propaganda and advertising by shipping line agents was often blamed for emigration by the conservative Swedish ruling class, which grew increasingly alarmed at seeing the agricultural labor force leave the country. It was a Swedish 19th-century cliché to blame the falling ticket prices and the pro-emigration propaganda of the transport system for the craze of emigration, but modern historians have varying views about the real importance of such factors. Brattne and Åkerman have examined the advertising campaigns and the ticket prices as a possible third force between <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull. They conclude that neither advertisements nor pricing had any decisive influence on Swedish emigration. While the companies remain unwilling, , to open their archives to researchers, the limited sources available suggest that ticket prices did drop in the 1880s, but remained on average artificially high because of cartels and price-fixing. On the other hand, H. A. Barton states that the cost of crossing the Atlantic dropped drastically between 1865 and 1890, encouraging poorer Swedes to emigrate. The research of Brattne and Åkerman has shown that the leaflets sent out by the shipping line agents to prospective emigrants would not so much celebrate conditions in the New World, as simply emphasize the comforts and advantages of the particular company. Descriptions of life in America were unvarnished, and the general advice to emigrants brief and factual. Newspaper advertising, while very common, tended to be repetitive and stereotyped in content.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{epidemiological}} {{studies show that}} <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling increase the risks of shoulder complaints and not necessarily of low back complaints. Moreover, {{the magnitude of the}} exerted hand forces during <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling is poorly related to the magnitude of the mechanical loading of the low back and the shoulder. In light of that, this paper combines results of several studies to present an approach for evaluating not only the exerted hand forces, but also the low back and shoulder load during <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling in practice. The approach specifies, based on scientific evidence, that (1) in order to validly obtain exposure (frequency <b>and</b> duration) to <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling, 10 workers should be observed during eight periods of 30 min; (2) how the exerted hand forces and the load of the low back and shoulder can be estimated in practice based solemnly on the weight of the object, one-handed or two-handed <b>pushing</b> or pulling, <b>and</b> the height of the handle; and finally, (3) how these outcomes can be evaluated in combination with existing guidelines regarding exerted hand forces, compression forces on the low back and the moments at the shoulder. Two cases will be presented here to illustrate the application of the approach. Relevance to industry The presented approach is the first to offer practitioners a fairly simple method for the ergonomic evaluation of <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling carts and four-wheeled containers in practice, especially as regarding the shoulder load.
