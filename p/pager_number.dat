House in turn reveals he did not {{actually}} tell NASA about Cooper's condition, and in fact lied to prevent anyone else from telling NASA, reasoning that Cooper's knowledge of her risk will make her a more careful pilot. Cameron is skeptical of his reason for doing so, suggesting instead that he was not willing to crush her dream.|$|E
50|$|Omar {{continues}} {{stalking the}} projects {{looking for a}} way to get at Avon. He eventually makes his way to Proposition Joe's place and donates some of his takings from the Barksdale's stash. These he offers in exchange for Avon's <b>pager</b> <b>number.</b> Omar tracks Avon down to Orlando's and tricks him into answering a page using Wee-Bey's code. Wee-Bey pulls up and Avon realizes that something is amiss. He dives out of range just as Omar opens fire. Wee-Bey and Omar exchange shots and Wee-Bey wings Omar who, wounded, retreats.|$|E
50|$|Joe first {{appears at}} an annual {{basketball}} game, the Eastside Projects' team versus the Westside Projects. Joe plays on Avon Barksdale's pride, goading him into doubling their wager on the outcome, then bringing in a ringer {{at the last minute}} to win the game. That same day, he is visited by stick-up-man Omar Little, who gives Joe some of the Barksdale Organization's stolen narcotics in exchange for Barksdale's <b>pager</b> <b>number.</b> Omar uses the information in an unsuccessful attempt on Barksdale's life but Joe's role in Omar's attack is never revealed to Barksdale. Joe later serves as a neutral go-between, organizing a meeting between Barksdale's business partner Stringer Bell and Omar to discuss a truce.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, the digit '9' {{was added}} to the front of mobile phone and <b>pager</b> <b>numbers,</b> making numbers eight digits, and on 1 March 2002, the digit '6' {{was added to}} the front of {{existing}} fixed line telephone numbers.|$|R
50|$|Pre-existing <b>pager</b> <b>numbers</b> {{were already}} {{scattered}} under various codes in the 02xx to 09xx range and had 9 digits. Several services used non-standard 01 numbers. These would all eventually {{be moved to}} 076 codes and to 10 digits in the Big Number Change in 2000.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{mobile and}} <b>pager</b> <b>numbers</b> were all {{moved into the}} 07xxx range. Pagers moved into 076xx, while {{personal}} numbers moved to 070.

5000|$|When {{the initial}} Barksdale detail is formed, Freamon {{is one of}} those {{transferred}} in because he was viewed as a useless [...] "hump", and the senior management have no intention of providing good detectives who would make a substantial case. When Polk and Mahon fail to find a good photo of Avon Barksdale, Freamon takes a cue from an offhand comment from Kima Greggs and tracks down a photo of Avon at a boxing gym, finally giving the unit a face to put to the name. He further impresses his colleagues when he locates D'Angelo Barksdale's <b>pager</b> <b>number</b> at an abandoned stash house. Impressed by Freamon's capabilities, Jimmy McNulty inquires about him in a conversation with Bunk who tells him Freamon is an ex-homicide detective. Later, while at the bar with Freamon, McNulty finds out that he was sent to the Pawn Shop unit for thirteen years (and four months) because he angered the then-Deputy Ops. Freamon then warns McNulty that he will probably suffer a similar fate {{at the conclusion of the}} case.|$|E
5000|$|Under D'Angelo's firm leadership, The Pit {{begins to}} turn a good profit. It {{nevertheless}} becomes {{a cause for concern}} when its stash is stolen by Omar Little, and, the next day, the police raid. (Their information is slightly outdated, and they raid a now abandoned stash house, but Lester finds D'Angelo's encrypted <b>pager</b> <b>number</b> on a wall.)Stringer chastises D'Angelo for his sloppiness, and Avon places a bounty on Omar's crew. Wallace and Poot identify Omar's boyfriend, Brandon, in an arcade; D'Angelo relays the message to Stringer, who has Brandon captured, tortured and killed. Wallace becomes haunted by his role in the death of Brandon. [...] Relating to Wallace's aversion to the violence of their trade, D'Angelo develops a friendship with Wallace. When Wallace wants to leave the business after seeing Brandon's mutilated remains, D'Angelo is supportive and gives him money. Stringer begins asking after Wallace; D'Angelo senses that Wallace is in trouble and asks Avon to leave him alone, reassuring him that Wallace is no danger to the organization. When Wallace returns and asks for his old job back, D'Angelo tries to get him to leave, but is unable to save him. Wallace is killed on Stringer's orders, though D'Angelo remains unaware that Bodie and Poot killed him.|$|E

40|$|Senior Medicines Enforcement Officer for the Department of Health’s Medicines Regulatory Group (MRG), Peter Moore said: “The Department {{is aware}} that {{distinctive}} red and white capsules containing the prescription only medicine pregabalin may have been illegally manufactured for circulation on the black market. “I would ask {{members of the public}} to avoid any prescription medicines obtained from illicit sources, whatever that source might be. Be in no doubt that medicines sourced in this way present a real danger to those taking them. Young people in particular may be unaware of the potentially fatal consequences of taking these drugs, particularly when taken with alcohol. " Professor Mike Mawhinney, Head of the Department of Health's Medicines Regulatory Group, added: “The risk to the public due to illegal or counterfeit medicines is significant. This problem is not something we can tackle in isolation and the Medicines Regulatory Group is committed to working with other agencies to disrupt the supply of illegal medicines and will take every opportunity to raise public awareness around the dangers of using medicines from unregulated sources. “I would urge the public to be vigilant and to avoid putting their health at risk by using medication from an illicit source. People should only take medicines in consultation with a healthcare professional who has access to patient health records. " Notes to editors: 1.

5000|$|Note {{that because}} of number portability, for both {{geographical}} and non-geographical (mobile, toll-free, premium rate) numbers, one cannot be sure about the operator that a number belongs to. All geographical codes (21x, 231x) end in a number from 0 to 6 (210 or 212 for Athens, 2310 or 2312 for Thessaloniki). Numbers whose code ends in [...] "0" [...] are or were originally operated by OTE. The same applies to mobile phones: All mobile codes (69x) end in 0,3,4,5,7,8 or 9 (690, 698). Mobile code [...] "696" [...] is assigned to OTE <b>pagers.</b> <b>Numbers</b> starting with 690 and 693 were originally assigned to WIND, with 694 and 695 to Vodafone, with 697 and 698 to Cosmote and with 699 to Q-Telecom until 2007 when it merged with WIND.|$|R
50|$|The {{changes made}} at PhONEday were one step towards reorganising the {{numbering}} plan {{at a later}} date, so that the first two digits would indicate the type of service called. PhONEday had cleared area codes from 02 to 09 of all geographic allocations by converting 9-digit numbers to 10-digit 01 numbers (and, in parts of at least 47 area codes, 8-digit numbers to 9-digit 01 numbers). After PhONEday, all pre-existing 9-digit mobile, non-geographic, premium rate, personal and <b>pager</b> <b>numbers</b> from 02 to 09 remained in place. Those would be moved to new 07, 08 and 09 prefixes and converted to 10-digits in the Big Number Change in 2000. However, from 1997 onwards, all new numbers for those services were allocated with 10-digits and already conforming to the new number plan: mobile phones (077xx, 078xx, 079xx), personal <b>numbers</b> (070), <b>pagers</b> (076), local-rate non-geographic revenue-share (0845), national-rate non-geographic revenue-share (0870) and premium rate (090x). Gaps were left within each of those new 10-digit number ranges {{to allow for the}} older 9-digit 02 to 09 numbers to migrate in the Big Number Change. Freephone numbers were an exception. Older 9-digit 0500 and 0800 numbers as well as newer 10-digit 0800 and 0808 numbers all remained in use after the Big Number Change.|$|R
50|$|In 1988, {{the east}} coast of Florida from Palm Beach County north through Brevard County, as well as the Orlando {{metropolitan}} area was assigned area code 407. In 1995, Broward County was split from 305 and assigned area code 954. Although this was intended to be a long-term solution, within two years the reconfigured area code 305 was already close to exhaustion due to explosive growth in South Florida, as well as the increasing popularity of cell phones and <b>pagers.</b> Available <b>numbers</b> were limited by the fact that Monroe County was split between two area codes, as well as the fact that all of South Florida from the Treasure Coast to the Keys is a single LATA. To solve this problem, area code 786 was installed as an overlay in 1998. The overlay originally only covered Miami-Dade County; the Keys were added in 2008.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the launch}} of NASA's Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) {{satellite}} in 1992, there has only been a handful of occurrences that have warranted manual intervention in the EUVE Science Operations Center (ESOC). So, {{in an effort to}} reduce costs, the current environment is being redesigned to utilize a combination of off-the-shelf packages and recently developed artificial intelligence (AI) software to automate the monitoring of the science payload and ground systems. The successful implementation of systemic automation would allow the ESOC to evolve from a seven day/week, three shift operation, to a seven day/week one shift operation. First, it was necessary to identify all areas considered mission critical. These were defined as follows: (1) The telemetry stream must be monitored autonomously and anomalies identified. (2) Duty personnel must be automatically paged and informed of the occurrence of an anomaly. (3) The 'basic' state of the ground system must be assessed. (4) Monitors should check that the systems and processes needed to continue in a 'healthy' operational mode are working at all times. (5) Network loads should be monitored to ensure that they stay within established limits. (6) Connectivity to Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) systems should be monitored as well, not just for connectivity of the network itself but also for the ability to transfer files. (7) All necessary peripheral devices should be monitored. This would include the disks, routers, tape drives, printers, tape carousel, and power supplies. (8) System daemons such as the archival daemon, the Sybase server, the payload monitoring software, and any other necessary processes should be monitored to ensure that they are operational. (9) The monitoring system needs to be redundant so that the failure of a single machine will not paralyze the monitors. (10) Notification should be done by means of looking though a table of the <b>pager</b> <b>numbers</b> for current 'on call' personnel. The software should be capable of dialing out to notify, sending email, and producing error logs. (11) The system should have knowledge of when real-time passes and tape recorder dumps will occur and should know that these passes and data transmissions are successful. Once the design criteria were established, the design team split into two groups: one that addressed the tracking, commanding, and health and safety of the science payload and another group that addressed the ground systems and communications aspects of the overall system...|$|R
40|$|The Automatic Dialing system {{purchased}} by D 0 {{is intended to}} help make the D 0 cryogenic system operate unattended by cryogenic operating personnel. The auto dialer is completely programmable and is voice synthesized. The auto dialer was purchased with 32 bistable inputs, but is expandable to 64 bistable inputs with the purchase of more electronic cards at an approximate cost of $ 260 per card (8 bistable inputs). The auto dialer also has the capability for analog inputs, analog outputs, and bistable outputs none of which D 0 uses or intends to use. The auto dialer can be called on its operating phone line to describe current alarms with the proper password. The Auto Dialer can dial lab extensions, lab <b>pagers,</b> and any <b>number</b> outside the lab. It cannot dial a long distance pager. The auto dialer monitors alarms and alarm conditions via the T 1565 PLC, upon an alarm condition it initiates a phone calling sequence of preprogrammed lists with assigned priorities. When someone is reached, the auto dialer describes the individual alarm it is calling for, by a preprogrammed set of words for that individual alarm, spoken by a female voice. The called person then has a chance to acknowledge the alarm over the telephone, if the alarm is not acknowledged the auto dialer will disconnect and call the next person on the list. The auto dialer will continue to cycle through the list until it is acknowledged, reset, or the alarm condition no longer exists...|$|R
