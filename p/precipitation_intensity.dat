40|$|Despite <b>precipitation</b> <b>intensities</b> may greatly vary {{during one}} flood event, {{detailed}} information about these intensities may {{not be required to}} accurately simulate floods with a hydrological model which rather reacts to cumulative precipitation sums. This raises two questions: to which extent is it important to preserve sub-daily <b>precipitation</b> <b>intensities</b> and how long does it effectively rain from the hydrological point of view? Both questions might seem straightforward to answer with a direct analysis of past precipitation events but require some arbitrary choices regarding the length of a precipitation event. To avoid these arbitrary decisions, here we present an alternative approach to characterize the effective length of precipitation event which is based on runoff simulations with respect to large floods. More precisely, we quantify the fraction of a day over which the daily precipitation has to be distributed to faithfully reproduce the large annual and seasonal floods which were generated by the hourly precipitation rate time series. New precipitation time series were generated by first aggregating the hourly observed data into daily totals and then evenly distributing them over sub-daily periods (n hours). These simulated time series were used as input to a hydrological bucket-type model and the resulting runoff flood peaks were compared to those obtained when using the original precipitation time series. We define then the effective daily precipitation duration as the number of hours n, for which the largest peaks are simulated best. For nine mesoscale Swiss catchments this effective daily precipitation duration was about half a day, which indicates that detailed information on <b>precipitation</b> <b>intensities</b> is not necessarily required to accurately estimate peaks of the largest annual and seasonal floods. These findings support the use of simple disaggregation approaches to make usage of past daily precipitation observations or daily precipitation simulations (e. g. from climate models) for hydrological modeling at an hourly time step...|$|R
40|$|In a {{changing}} climate, {{a key role}} may be played by the response of convective-type cloud and precipitation to temperature changes 1, 2, 3. Yet, it is unclear if convective <b>precipitation</b> <b>intensities</b> will increase mainly due to thermodynamic or dynamical processes 4. Here we perform large eddy simulations of convection by imposing a realistic diurnal cycle of surface temperature. We find convective events to gradually self-organize into larger cloud clusters and those events occurring {{late in the day}} to produce the highest <b>precipitation</b> <b>intensities.</b> Tracking rain cells throughout their life cycles, we show that events which result from collisions respond strongly to changes in boundary conditions, such as temperature changes. Conversely, events not resulting from collisions remain largely unaffected by the boundary conditions. Increased surface temperature indeed leads to more interaction between events and stronger precipitation extremes. However, comparable intensification occurs when leaving temperature unchanged but simply granting more time for self-organization. These findings imply that the convective field as a whole acquires a memory of past precipitation and inter-cloud dynamics, driving extremes. For global climate model projections, our results suggest that the interaction between convective clouds must be incorporated to simulate convective extremes and the diurnal cycle more realistically...|$|R

In this paper, we present a new formalism for downscaling satellite precipitation observations, which explicitly allows {{for the preservation of}} some key geometrical and statistical properties of spatial precipitation. These include sharp intensity gradients (due to high-intensity regions embedded within lower-intensity areas), coherent spatial structures (due to regions of slowly varying rainfall), and thicker-than-Gaussian tails of <b>precipitation</b> gradients and <b>intensities.</b> Specifically, we pose the downscaling problem as a discrete inverse problem and solve it via a regularized variational approach (variational downscaling) where the regularization term is selected to impose the desired smoothness in the solution while allowing for some steep gradients (called ℓ 1 -norm or total variation regularization).

The aim {{of this paper is}} to present this data set to the different communities active in regional climate modelling, impact assessment and adaptation. The EURO-CORDEX ensemble results have been compared to the SRES A 1 B simulation results achieved within the ENSEMBLES project. The large-scale patterns of changes in mean temperature and precipitation are similar in all three scenarios, but they differ in regional details, which can partly be related to the higher resolution in EURO-CORDEX. The results strengthen those obtained in ENSEMBLES, but need further investigations. The analysis of impact indices shows that for RCP 8. 5, there is a substantially larger change projected for temperature-based indices than for RCP 4. 5. The difference is less pronounced for precipitation-based indices. Two effects of the increased resolution can be regarded as an added value of regional climate simulations.

5000|$|The {{catchment}} {{of a river}} above {{a certain}} location {{is determined by the}} surface area of all land which drains toward the river from above that point. The river's discharge at that location depends on the rainfall on the catchment or drainage area and the inflow or outflow of groundwater to or from the area, stream modifications such as dams and irrigation diversions, as well as evaporation and evapotranspiration from the area's land and plant surfaces. In storm hydrology, an important consideration is the stream's discharge hydrograph, a record of how the discharge varies over time after a precipitation event. The stream rises to a peak flow after each precipitation event, then falls in a slow recession. Because the peak flow also corresponds to the maximum water level reached during the event, it is of interest in flood studies. Analysis of the relationship between <b>precipitation</b> <b>intensity</b> and duration and the response of the stream discharge are aided by the concept of the unit hydrograph, which represents the response of stream discharge over time to the application of a hypothetical [...] "unit" [...] amount and duration of rainfall (e.g., half an inch over one hour).

In {{this study}} {{consideration}} {{is given to}} the po-tential use of radar-derived quantitative precipitation esti-mates (QPE) as flash flood guidance {{in the context of the}} Italian Civil Protection flood risk management system. The interest in high <b>precipitation</b> <b>intensities</b> and accumulation motivated the case study of the 26 September 2007 event, in which a quasi-stationary mesoscale convective system brought within 3 – 6 h 40 % of the mean annual precipitation to the wider Venice-Mestre area, i. e. 260 mm in Venice-Mestre and 325 mm in closeby Valle Averto. Comparison of the radar-derived QPE in the area with the rain gauge network revealed a good correspondence for warm season rainfall, both for daily accumulations in the longterm (about 2 years) and hourly accumulations for the case under consideration. The long term average radar to gauge ratio is very close to 0 dB with an uncertainty of ap-proximately ± 3 dB, i. e. roughly a factor of two, slightly bet-ter for higher <b>precipitation</b> <b>intensities.</b> For the hourly accu-mulations during this very intense event the spread is similar, while the average is slightly positive. The locations of the rainfall accumulation maximum as de-tected, respectively, by the radar and by the rain gauge net-work do not coincide. Given the relatively good quality of the precipitation estimation, it is argued that these areas ef-fectively have received even larger rainfall amounts, and that it is worthwhile to further investigate the potential of radar to be used as flash flood guidance...|$|R
40|$|There is much {{evidence}} that precipitation responses {{to global warming}} involve wet regions becoming wetter and dry regions drier. This presents challenges for the interpretation of projections from general circulation models (GCMs) which have substantial biases in the location of precipitation features. While improving GCM simulated precipitation is the most desirable solution, adaptation and mitigation decisions must be made with the models already available. Many techniques {{have been developed to}} correct biases in grid point <b>precipitation</b> <b>intensities,</b> but few have been introduced to correct for location biases. Here, we describe a new technique for correcting the spatial and seasonal location of climatological precipitation features.

We discuss the mathematical basis of the technique and investigate its behaviour in different regimes. We find that the resulting warps depend smoothly on the most influential parameter, which determines the balance between smoothness and closeness of fit. We show that the technique is capable of removing more than half the RMS error in a model's climatology, obtaining consistently better results when conserving integrated precipitation. To demonstrate the ability of the new technique to improve simulated precipitation changes, we apply our transformations to historical anomalies and show that RMS error is reduced relative to GPCP's anomalies by approximately 10 % for both types of warp. This verifies that errors in precipitation changes can be reduced by correcting underlying location errors in a GCM's climatology...|$|R

The first part of this work focuses on a MF analysis of the climatology of <b>precipitation</b> <b>intensities</b> simulated by the COSMO numerical weather prediction model. Analysis of the spatial structure of the MF parameters, and their correlations with external meteorological and topographi-cal descriptors, reveals that simulated precipitation tends to be smoother at higher altitudes, and that the mean inter-mittency is mostly influenced by the latitude. A hierarchical clustering was performed on the external descriptors, yielding three different clusters, which correspond roughly to Alpine/continental, Mediterranean and temperate regions. Distributions of MF parameters within these three clusters are shown to be statistically significantly different, indicating that the MF signature of rain is indeed geographically dependent.

The MF parameters of <b>precipitation</b> <b>intensities</b> at the ground are compared with those obtained from the Swiss radar composite during three events corresponding to typical synoptic conditions over Switzerland.

A comparison of the operational one-moment microphysical parameteriza-tion scheme of COSMO with a more advanced two-moment scheme reveals that, while no scheme systematically outper-forms the other, the two-moment scheme tends to produce larger extreme values and more discontinuous precipitation fields, which agree better with the radar composite...|$|R

In this study, a procedure for the identification and localization of torrent catchments in which the climate scenarios will modify the hazard situation was developed. In two case studies, the impacts of a potential increase of <b>precipitation</b> <b>intensities</b> to the delimited hazard zones were studied. The identification and localization of the torrent and river catchments, where unfavourable changes in the hazard situation occur, could eliminate speculative and unnecessary measures against the impacts of climate changes like a general enlargement of hazard zones or a general over dimensioning of protection structures for the whole territory. The results showed a high spatial variability of the sensitivity of catchments to climate changes. In sensitive catchments, the sediment management in alpine torrents will meet future challenges due to a higher rate for sediment removal from retention basins. The case studies showed a remarkable increase of the areas affected by floods and debris flow when considering possible future <b>precipitation</b> <b>intensities</b> in hazard mapping. But, the calculated increase in extent of future hazard zones lay within the uncertainty of the methods used today for the delimitation of the hazard zones. Thus, the consideration of the uncertainties laying in the methods for the elaboration of hazard zone maps in the torrent and river catchments sensitive to climate changes would provide a useful instrument for the consideration of potential future climate conditions. The study demonstrated that weak points in protection structures in future will become more important in risk management activities...|$|R
40|$|Engineering {{infrastructures}} such as stormwater drains {{and bridges}} are commonly designed using {{the concept of}} Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves, which assume that the occurrence of precipitation patterns and distributions are spatially similar within the drainage area and remain unchanged throughout the lifespan of the infrastructures (stationary). Based {{on the premise that}} climate change will alter the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation patterns, inaccuracy in the estimation of IDF curves may occur. As such, prior to developing IDF curves, it is crucial to analyse trends of annual precipitation maxima. The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the <b>precipitation</b> <b>intensities</b> and their uncertainties (lower and upper limits) for durations of 0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, and 6  h and return periods of 2, 10, 25, 50 and 100  years in the Ghaap plateau, Northern Cape Province, South Africa using the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. The annual precipitation maxima were extracted from long-term (1918 – 2014) precipitation data for four meteorological stations (Postmasburg, Douglas, Kuruman and Groblershoop) sourced from the South African Weather Services (SAWS). On average, the estimated extreme <b>precipitation</b> <b>intensities</b> for the plateau ranged from 4. 2  mm/h for 6  h storm duration to 55. 8  mm/h for 0. 125  h at 2  years return period. At 100  year return period, the intensity ranged from 13. 3  mm/h for 6  h duration to 175. 5  mm/h for the duration of 0. 125  h. The lower limit of uncertainty ranged from 11. 7 % at 2  years return period to 26 % at 100  year return period, and from 12. 8 % to 58. 4 % for the upper limit for the respective return periods. This methodology can be integrated into policy formulation for the design of stormwater and flood management infrastructures in the Ghaap plateau, where mining is the main economic activity...|$|R
