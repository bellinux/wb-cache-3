5000|$|In {{the normal}} {{progression}} of a mortgage, payments of are made {{according to the}} loan documents until the mortgage is paid in full (or paid off). The lender holds a lien on the property and if the borrower sells the property before the mortgage is paid-off, the unpaid balance of the mortgage is paid to the lender to release the lien. Any change to the mortgage terms is a modification. Changes may include any of the following: a reduction of the yield (commonly {{referred to as the}} interest rate), an extension of the <b>payment</b> <b>term</b> (ex. extending a 30 year term to a 40 year term), or a reduction of the principal balance of the loan.|$|E
5000|$|Reverse mortgage: In {{the extreme}} or {{limiting}} {{case of the}} principle of negative amortization, the borrower in a loan does not need to make payments on the loan until the loan comes due; that is, all interest is capitalized, and the original principal and all interest accrued as of the due date are paid off together and at once. The most common context in which this arrangement occurs is that of using residential single-family real estate as collateral for the loan, in which case the loan is known as a reverse mortgage. In the United States of America, the terms of reverse mortgages are heavily regulated by federal law, which as of January 2016 places a lower age limit on the set of permitted borrowers and requires that the mortgage come due only when the borrower no longer uses the property in question as his/her principal residence, usually due to the borrower's death.Due to the specificity of the reverse-mortgage concept and the limited context in which the term appears in practice, most United States authorities use the term [...] "negative amortization" [...] to denote those and only those loans in which the borrower pays throughout the lifetime of the loan but during and only during its early stages, known as the negative-amortization or [...] "NegAm" [...] period, makes what are in effect partial payments, namely payments lower than the amount of interest accrued during the <b>payment</b> <b>term.</b>|$|E

40|$|Reverse {{factoring}} –a {{financial arrangement}} where a corporation facilitates early payment of its trade credit obligations to suppliers– is increasingly popular in industry. Many firms use the scheme to induce their suppliers to grant them more lenient payment terms. By {{means of a}} periodic review base stock model that includes alternative sources of financing, we explore the following question: what extensions of payment terms allow the supplier to benefit from reverse factoring? We obtain solutions by means of simulation optimization. We find that an extension of payment terms induces a non-linear financing cost for the supplier, beyond the opportunity cost of carrying additional receivables. Furthermore, {{we find that the}} size of the <b>payment</b> <b>term</b> extension that a supplier can accommodate depends on demand uncertainty and the cost structure of the supplier. Overall, our results show that the financial implications of an extension of payment terms needs careful assessment in stochastic settings...|$|E

Since the suppliers {{are one of the}} most essential components of the value chain, supplier selection and evaluation processes are critically important management tasks. In a typical supplier evaluation process, suppliers are analyzed due to criteria such as quality, cost, delivery, and flexibility. These analyses are usually complex processes which require expertise. The purpose of this study is to give insights to expert system development on supplier assessment process by comparing neural network and discriminant analysis methods. The methods are applied to real world data from 51 long term suppliers of a medium sized company from German Iron and Steel Industry.

40|$|Supply chain finance (SCF) {{can improve}} supply chain {{performance}} by facilitating longer payment terms for buyers and {{better access to}} financing for suppliers. In spite of these clear benefits, there is empirical evidence for some hesitation and resistance to SCF adoption, manifesting in an often substantial time lag between a buyer's introduction of SCF and its adoption by all targeted suppliers. Observed adoption processes often resemble the s-shaped Bass-curve suggesting that successful early adoptions support adoption decisions by other suppliers. Based on these observations, we consider supplier SCF adoption decisions within a diffusion model, to obtain insights regarding a buyer's optimal SCF introduction decisions in terms of timing and payment terms. We find that initial payment terms and procurement volume strongly affect the optimal timing of SCF introduction and optimal <b>payment</b> <b>term</b> extensions. The {{degree to which the}} buyer can influence suppliers in their adoption decisions affects the optimal introduction timing, but not optimal payment terms. Interestingly, our results suggest that, in spite of the clear benefits, many buyers might be well-advised to postpone their SCF implementations...|$|E

The existence of high number of vendor and criteria, and the fragmentation of construction process have increased the difficulties of construction vendor selection process. This situation created a decision making dilemma for construction companies to select the right IBS vendor that fulfils the project needs. Thus, a decision making tool is recommend for this purpose. This paper discusses a decision making technique called Multi Attributes Decision Making (MADM) and set of criteria used in literature for construction vendor selection. As an initial step to develop a decision model, past studies were analysed to gather the related IBS vendor selection criteria. It is identified that the selection criteria can be categorize into cost, quality, service, buyer and vendor relationship, assurance supply, <b>payment</b> <b>term,</b> and past performance. Based on our frequency analysis, 38 criteria were found related with IBS vendor selection.
