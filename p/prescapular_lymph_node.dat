40|$|The {{distribution}} of Rift Valley fever (RVF) viral antigen was studied by immunohistochemistry in the liver, spleen, <b>prescapular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> lungs and kidneys of eight experimentally infected new-born lambs and in four new-born lambs that died of RVF during the 1974 - 75 RVF epidemic. The eight experimentally infected lambs were euthanazed at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 33, 48 and 51 h post-infection (p. i.), respectively. Immunohistochemical staining utilized polyclonal hyperimmune mouse ascites fluid to RVF virus and peroxidase-diaminobenzidine as substrate. Virus antigen was most {{prominent in the}} liver and was detected as early as 18 h p. i. in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes that were sparsely scattered throughout the lobules. At 24 - 33 h p. i., antigen was also present in or adjacent to small foci of hepatocellular necrosis. At 48 - 51 h p. i. {{and in one of}} the field cases, positive staining was widespread and most consistently present in the cytoplasm of large numbers of degenerated or necrotic hepatocytes and in a few acidophilic bodies. Immunohistochemical staining was rarely observed in hepatocyte nuclei. Almost diffuse histochemical staining was observed in disintegrated cells and in the cytoplasm of necrotic hepatocytes throughout the liver in the other three field cases with pannecrosis; only the primary foci of necrosis and a narrow periportal rim of intact hepatocytes did not stain. No staining was observed in bile duct epithelium, endothelial and Kupffer cells in the initial stages of infection, supporting the contention that hepatocytes constitute the primary site of RVF virus replication in new-born lambs.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{demonstrate}} that embryo transfer can be used to produce CAEV-free kids from CAEV-infected biological mothers when appropriate procedure is implemented. Twenty-eight goats that had tested positive for CAEV using PCR on vaginal secretions were used as embryo donors. Embryos with intact-ZP were selected and washed 10 times; they were then frozen and used for transfer into CAEV-free recipient goats. Nineteen of the 49 recipient goats gave birth, producing a total of 23 kids. Three blood samples were taken from each recipient goat, 10 days before, during, and 10 days after parturition; these were tested for CAEV antibodies using ELISA and for CAEV proviral DNA using PCR. The mothers were then euthanized. Tissue samples were taken from the lungs, udder, and retromammary and <b>prescapular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> The kids were separated from their mothers at birth. Seven of them died. At 4 months of age, 16 kids were subjected to drug-induced immunosuppression. Blood samples were taken every month from birth to 4 months of age; samples were then taken on days 15, 21, and 28 after the start of the immunosuppressive treatment. The kids were then euthanized and tissue samples taken from the carpal synovial membrane, lung tissue, <b>prescapular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> inguinal and retromammary <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> and uterus. All samples from the 19 recipient goats and 23 kids were found to be negative for CAEV antibodies and/or CAEV proviral DNA.

40|$|A not {{pregnant}} 4 -year-old Jersey cow {{was presented}} with the sudden appearance of respiratory noise, nasal discharge and moderate respiratory difficulty. Upon physical examination a snoring-like noise, extended head and neck position, exaggerated abdominal effort, bilateral nasal discharge and left <b>prescapular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> enlargement were noted. Sub-occlusion of the initial portion of the respiratory tract was suspected. Radiographic and endoscopic examinations revealed a pedunculate mass on the dorsal aspect of the rhinopharynx, which was removed with endoscopically assisted electrosurgery. Histologic examination revealed a chronic pyogranulomatous inflammation with eosinophilic club-like bodies surrounding small colonies of rod-shaped bacteria. Results of histochemical staining were consistent with Actinobacillus-like bacteria and a diagnosis of respiratory actinobacillosis was reached.

40|$|Introduction: Canine rhabdomyosarcomas (RBDs) are classifiedinto embryonal, botryoid, {{alveolar}} and pleomorphic forms. Althoughrare, the embryonal type is {{the most}} common and is reported to havea locally invasive behaviour and metastatic potential. Materials and Methods: An 11 -year-old pointer had a subcutaneousmass in the left forearm and an enlarged <b>prescapular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> Cytology, immunocytochemistry (ICC), histology and electron microscopy(EM) were performed. Results: Cytology of the mass and lymph node showed neoplasticcells with morphological features consistent with an undifferentiatedsarcoma. Cytological atypia was severe. Histology revealed a subcutaneous,unencapsulated neoplasm composed of sheets of cells with thesame morphology observed in aspirates. The lymph node was positivefor metastasis. Expression of vimentin, desmin and myoglobin wasdemonstrated using ICC and indicated a diagnosis of RBD. EM revealednumerous mitochondria, large nuclei and nucleoli and raredense masses of tangled myofilaments, suggestive of poorly differentiatedrhabdomyoblasts. The findings were consistent with an embryonalRBD. Six months after treatment the dog remains free of disease. Conclusions: Cytology and ICC are pivotal for the diagnosis ofRBD. Despite the guarded prognosis, in this case of metastatic embryonalRBD the dog responded well to therapy. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|A {{subcutaneous}} mass on {{the left}} antebrachium of an 11 -year-old intact female English Pointer dog was evaluated presurgically by cytologic examination and immunocytochemical staining. The sample consisted of discrete, variably sized, markedly pleomorphic neoplastic cells that expressed vimentin with diffuse cytoplasmic staining, desmin with focal paranuclear staining, and myoglobin with diffuse cytoplasmic staining, consistent with a diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma. Lymphocytic and histiocytic markers were negative. Aspirates of the enlarged ipsilateral <b>prescapular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> were positive for metastatic disease. Surgical excision of the tumor and lymph node were followed by histologic and electron microscopic examination. Histomorphologic appearance of neoplastic cells from the mass and the lymph node paralleled cytologic findings; the histologic diagnosis was round cell variant of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. By ultrastructural evaluation, cells contained numerous mitochondria and masses of cytoplasmic tangled myofilaments, features typical of rhabdomyoblasts. The dog received doxorubicin (30 mg/m 2) every 3 weeks for 5 treatments. Local recurrence developed 6 months after resection but was not treated.

40|$|Abstract. Two {{outbreaks}} of cutaneous pythiosis caused by Pythium insidiosum were diagnosed in two herds of crossbred hair wool sheep {{of different ages}} in the semiarid region of Northeastern Brazil. In one herd of 120 sheep, 40 were affected. The other outbreak affected six sheep out of 80. Local swellings with ulcerative lesions were observed in the limbs and abdominal and prescapular regions. Three sheep were necropsied. Two of them had lung metastasis characterized by multifocal nodules measuring 0. 5 – 2 cm. In one animal, the <b>prescapular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was also affected. In another, the cutaneous lesion extended to the sesamoid bone. Microscopically, there were multifocal granulomas with intralesional P. insidiosum hyphae and Splendore-Hoeppli material surrounding the hyphae.

40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} viral disease affecting biungulate species. Commercial vaccines, formu-lated with inactivated FMD virus (FMDV), are regularly used worldwide to control the disease. Here, we studied the generation of antibody responses in local lymphoid tissues along the respiratory system in vaccinated and further aerosol-infected cattle. Animals immunized with a high-payloadmonovalent FMD vaccine developed high titers of neutralizing antibodies at 7 days postvaccination (dpv), reaching a plateau at 29 dpv. FMDV-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC), predominantly IgM, were evident at 7 dpv in the <b>prescapular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> (LN) draining the vaccination site and in distal LN draining the respiratory mu-cosa, although in lower numbers. At 29 dpv, a significant switch to IgG 1 was clear in prescapular LN, while FMDV-specific ASC were detected in all lymphoid tissues draining the respiratory tract, mostly as IgM-secreting cells. None of the animals (n 10) exhibited FMD symptoms after oronasal challenge at 30 dpv. Three days postinfection, a large increase in ASC numbers and rapid isotype switches to IgG 1 were observed, particularly in LN-draining virus replication sites already described. These results indicate {{for the first time}} that systemic FMD vaccination in cattle effectively promotes the presence of anti-FMDVASC in lym-phoid tissues associated with the respiratory system. Oronasal infection triggered an immune reaction compatible with a local anamnestic response upon contact with the replicating FMDV, suggesting that FMD vaccination induces the circulation of virus...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{reported in}} this paper examine the cell-surface phenotype (CD 5, CD 4, CD 8, T 19, MHC class II and sIg) and cell output of lymphocyte subsets circulating through a subcutaneous lymph node in the sheep fetus, in an environment unaffected by foreign antigen and circulating immunoglobulins. CD 4 + lymphocytes were the major T-cell subset in fetal lymph and were clearly enriched in lymph compared with blood, whereas T 19 +, CD 8 + and B lymphocytes were not. It seems likely that in the fetus CD 4 + lymphocytes are extracted from the blood {{at a faster rate}} than are other T-cell subsets and B cells. There was a much higher percentage of CD 8 + and T null cells and a lower percentage of MHC class II+ and B cells circulating in the fetal lymph than in adult lymph, while the percentage of T 19 + lymphocytes in fetal blood was twice that in the adult. Although the hourly cell output from an adult <b>prescapular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was far higher than that from a fetal lymph node, the circulation of lymphocytes through fetal lymph nodes was much greater per gram lymph node weight than that through adult lymph nodes.

40|$|A {{method for}} cannulating the efferent duct of the <b>prescapular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> of sheep was {{developed}} and carried out on over 100 occasions so that lymph could be collected from unanaesthetized sheep under physiological con-ditions. On average the lymph flowed at 9 mlJh and contained 15 X 106 lymphocytesJml. The surgical procedure and relevant anatomical details are described. As experimental animals sheep are relatively cheap and easy to keep: their size makes them suitable subjects for many surgical procedures; they are not particularly susceptible to infection or surgical shock, and their docile nature {{is a very important}} factor in the success of chronic surgical preparations (Glover & O'Dell, 1975). The latter property led to their introduction as subjects for various chronic lymphatic fistulae (Lascelles & Morris,] 961), and methods for cannulating the efferent ducts of peripheral somatic lymph nodes such as the popliteal (Hall & Morris, 1962) and the prefemoral (Hall, 1967) are well established and have been applied to a variety of immunological investigations (Hall, 1971). However, it is necessary sometimes to collect greater quantities of lymph than these smaller nodes can provide without subjecting the animal to the depletion of cells, protein and electrolytes that accompany the cannulation of major lymph trunks like the intestinal or thor-acic ducts. For this purpose we have developed a procedure for cannulating the efferent duct of the prescapular (superficial cervical) lymph node and have been using it routinely for 10 years. Although the technique has proved both simple and useful, no account of it has been published in English and {{the purpose of this paper}} is to describe the method and to provide the relevant anatomical and physiological details...|$|E
40|$|The {{systemic}} {{immune response}} {{is a dynamic}} process involving the trafficking of lymphocytes from the Ag-stimulated lymph node to the peripheral tissue. Studies in sheep have demonstrated several phases of cell output in the efferent lymph after Ag stimulation. When skin contact sensitizers are used as Ag, the efferent lymph cell output peaks � 96 h after Ag stimulation and is temporally associated with the recruitment of cells into the skin. To investigate the relative contribution of this high-output phase of efferent lymphocytes to lymphocytic inflammation in the skin, we used a common contact sensitizer 2 -phenyl- 4 -ethoxymethylene- 5 -oxazolone (oxazolone) to stimulate the skin and draining <b>prescapular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> of adult sheep. The efferent lymph ducts draining the Ag-stimulated and contralateral control lymph nodes were cannulated throughout the experimental period. The lymphocytes leaving the lymph nodes during the 72 -h period before maximum infiltration were differentially labeled with fluorescent tracers, reinjected into the arterial circulation, and tracked {{to the site of}} Ag stimulation. Quantitative tissue cytometry of the skin {{at the conclusion of the}} injection period (96 h after Ag stimulation) demonstrated more migratory cells derived from the Ag-stimulated lymph node than the contralateral control (median 18. 5 vs 15. 5 per field; p < 0. 05). However, when corrected for total cell output of the lymph node, the Ag-stimulated migratory cells were 3. 8 -fold more prevalent in the skin than the contralateral control cells.

Before and after infection rectal temperatures and clinical signs of the lambs were recorded, blood and <b>prescapular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> smears were prepared and examined {{to determine the extent of}} the parasitaemia, and blood samples were analyzed to evaluate their haemoglobin (Hb) and packed cell volume (PCV) rates. Three days after the commencement of a febrile reaction and appearance of the schizonts in the lymph node smears, treatment of the lambs in Group A with an extract containing the alkaloids of Peganum harmala (wild rue) was commenced. Group B lambs were kept untreated controls. Before treatment there were no significant differences in the rectal temperature, parasitaemia rate, and the Hb and PCV values between animals in the two groups but after treatment significant differences in these values was detected (P < 0. 05). After treatment, the clinical signs and parasites in the lymph node smears of the animals in Group A disappeared and they all animals recovered. These parameters in the animals of Group B progressed until their death. Pathological studies showed the characteristic lesions of theileriosis in lambs in Group B, but not in Group A. The results indicate a therapeutic effect of the alkaloids of P. harmala for treatment of ovine malignant theileriosis. </span...|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coliO 157 :H 7 is an enteric {{pathogen}} {{of animals and}} humans that can result in deadly sequelae. Cattle are asymptom-atic carriers and shedders of the bacteria and serve as an important reservoir of human infection. E. coliO 157 :H 7 colonizes the gastrointestinal tract, most frequently at the rectoanal junctionmucosa in cattle. Vaccination is a potentially highly effective means of decreasing cattle colonization and shedding and thereby decreasing human infections. Currently available vaccines are administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly, and immune responses have been evaluated solely by systemic immunoglobu-lin responses. This study evaluated local and systemic lymphoproliferative responses in addition to immunoglobulin responses following subcutaneous or mucosal (rectal) immunization with E. coliO 157 :H 7 outer membrane protein intimin over three tri-als. In all three trials, significant local and systemic lymphoproliferative responses (P< 0. 05) occurred following immunization {{in the majority of}} animals, as well as significant immunoglobulin responses (P< 0. 001) in all animals. Surprisingly, local re-sponses in the mesorectal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were very similar between the subcutaneous andmucosal immunization groups. More-over, the responses in mesorectal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> appeared targeted rather than generalized, as minimal or no significant responses were observed in the associated <b>prescapular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of subcutaneously immunized animals. The results indicate that both subcutaneous and mucosal immunizations are effective methods of inducing immune responses against E. coliO 157 :H 7 in cattle. Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is an importantzoonotic pathogen in humans, causing self-limiting to sever...|$|R

A total of 50 cross bred cows of age 2 - 5 years {{were included in the}} study. Twenty animals of same age were kept as healthy controls. The affected animals showed signs and symptoms of bovine theileriosis i. e., high rise in body temperature, general debility, enlarged <b>prescapular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> mucosal hemorrhages, conjunctivitis, etc. These animals were subjected to examination of peripheral blood smears for the presence of Theileria annulata schizonts in infected mononuclear cells and piroplasms in red blood cells. Significant (P≤ 0. 05) decrease was observed in total erythrocyte counts, packed cell volume, hemoglobin, serum total proteins, albumin, globulins, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, cholesterol and triglycerides concentrations in cattle affected with bovine theileriosis compared with healthy controls, while significant (P≤ 0. 05) increase was observed in serum bilirubin and alanine transaminase of affected cattle compared with healthy controls. Non significant differences were observed in serum magnesium and uric acid concentration in both affected and healthy controls. These observations revealed that bovine theileriosis caused by T. annulata in cross bred cattle in semi arid zone is associated with hemato-biochemical alterations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAccumulation of the {{misfolded}} prion protein, PrPSc in {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) is strongly linked to progressive neurodegenerative disease. For many transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), peripheral lymphoid tissue is an important site of PrPSc amplification but without gross immunological consequence. Susceptible VRQ homozygous New Zealand Cheviot sheep were infected with SSBP/ 1 scrapie by inoculation in the drainage area of the <b>prescapular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> The earliest time that PrPSc was consistently detected by immunohistology in these nodes was D 50 post infection. This transcriptomic study of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> taken before (D 10) and after (D 50) the detection of PrPSc, aimed to identify the genes and physiological pathways affected by disease progression within the nodes as assessed by PrPSc detection. Affymetrix Ovine Gene arrays identified 75 and 80 genes as differentially-expressed at D 10 and D 50, respectively, in comparison with control sheep inoculated with uninfected brain homogenate. Approximately 70 % of these were repressed at each time point. RT-qPCR analysis of seven genes showed statistically significant correlation with the array data, although the results for IL 1 RN and TGIF were different between the two technologies. The ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) and general low level of repression of gene expression in lymphoid tissue, including many inflammatory genes, contrasts with the pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic events that occur within the CNS at equivalent stages of disease progression as assessed by PrPSc accumulation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Balloon cell {{melanoma}} {{is a rare}} {{variant of}} amelanotic melanoma {{that is difficult to}} differentiate from sebaceous cell carcinoma, liposarcoma, and other clear cell neoplasms without immunohistochemistry or ultrastructural evidence of melanin or melanosomes. Objective: The purpose of this report was to describe the clinical, cytologic, histologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural findings in a dog with metastatic balloon cell melanoma. Methods: A 6 -year-old female Golden Retriever was evaluated for a white, flocculent infiltrate in the anterior chamber of the left eye and an enlarged left <b>prescapular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> Cytologic evaluation of the eye and lymph node were performed following aqueocentesis and fine-needle aspiration, respectively. The affected lymph node was examined histologically and stained for cytokeratin, vimentin, S- 100, and Melan A. Following euthanasia a necropsy was performed and samples of the affected lymph node were examined by electron microscopy. Results: Cytologic examination of the lymph node and aqueocentesis sample revealed round neoplastic cells that had abundant clear vacuolated cytoplasm. A tentative diagnosis of metastatic sebaceous cell carcinoma or clear cell neoplasm was made. Histologically, the affected lymph node had similar polygonal clear cells arranged in sheets and packets divided by delicate fibrovascular stroma. Immunohistochemical staining of the cells was negative for cytokeratin but positive for vimentin, weakly positive for S- 100, and strongly positive for Melan A. At necropsy, metastatic lesions were identified in the diaphragm, heart, lung, kidneys, left eye, prescapular and sublumbar lymph nodes, and multiple skin sites. Ultrastructural examination of neoplastic lymph nodes revealed many membranebound vacuoles, myelinlike figures, and rare melanosomes. Conclusion: Immunohistochemical staining and ultrastructural features of the neoplastic cells supported a diagnosis of metastatic balloon cell melanoma.

40|$|The {{rejection}} of renal homografts {{has been studied}} in sheep by transplanting kidneys into the neck and preserving the renal lymphatic drainage intact. Chronic fistulae were established in the transplanted renal lymphatics and lymph collected throughout {{the life of the}} graft. The changes that occurred in homografts during the process of rejection were reflected in changes in the lymph. Large numbers of basophilic, blast, lymphoid cells appeared in the lymph, and lymph production in the grafted kidney increased 20 – 50 fold. Over a period of about 10 days, up to 60 g wet weight of lymphoid cells and up to 10 liters of lymph were collected from the graft. Within 24 hr of grafting, the host cells present in the renal lymph had become sensitized to the graft and transformed into blast cells when cultivated in Millipore chambers in vitro. When the cells leaving the graft during the first 18 – 48 hr were injected into distant nonstimulated lymph nodes of the host sheep, they evoked significant cellular and antibody responses in the nodes. Within the graft, the main pathological changes were found in the vascular endothelium and many of the peritubular capillaries become plugged with emboli comprised of blast cells. There was extensive infiltration of the renal parenchyma with lymphoid cells and evidence of their transformation and proliferation within the renal blood capillaries. When all the lymph and cells leaving the homograft were diverted from the body, there was a greatly decreased reaction in the regional <b>prescapular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> and no reaction in lymph nodes distant from the graft. In these circumstances, the survival of the graft was not prolonged, and it was rejected without involvement of the lymph nodes of the host. Humoral antibody was produced in the lymph node regional to the homograft within 48 – 60 hr of grafting. Antibody was not detected in the blood or in the renal lymph until near to the time the graft was rejected. It was thought that this was due to the binding of antibody by the kidney graft tissue. We conclude that all the events which lead to the recognition and {{rejection of}} renal homografts can occur centrally within the graft itself...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the early establishment of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection, we injected BLV-infected or mock-infected allogeneic cells into {{the shoulder of}} sheep in which an efferent lymphatic duct of the draining <b>prescapular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> had been cannulated. Rare mononuclear cells acting as centers of BLV infection in culture were present within 4 to 6 days in efferent lymph and within 6 to 10 days in blood. Soon after BLV injection, immunoglobulin M+ (IgM+) and CD 8 + cells increased in efferent lymph and oscillated reciprocally in frequency. CD 8 + blasts increased on days 4 to 6, when infectious centers increased 100 -fold in lymph. On days 6 and 7, both lymph and blood were enriched with CD 8 + cells that were labeled late on day 5 with an intravenous pulse of 5 -bromo- 2 ′-deoxyuridine (BrdU). Lymph, but not blood, was enriched with BrdU+ B cells on day 7. Capsid-specific antibodies became detectable in efferent lymph on days 6 to 8 and surface glycoprotein-specific antibodies on day 9, preceding their detection in serum by 9 to 14 days. Systemic dissemination of BLV-infected cells was thus accompanied {{by an increase in}} proliferating CD 8 + cells and the onset of BLV-specific antibodies in lymph. Infectious centers reached maximum frequencies of 0. 2 % in lymph by days 11 to 13, and then their frequencies increased by 5 - to 40 -fold in blood cells, suggesting that many infected blood cells do not recirculate back into lymph. Beginning on days 10 to 13, a subpopulation of B cells having high levels of surface IgM increased sharply in peripheral blood. Such cells were not present in lymph. After a day 16 pulse of BrdU, recently proliferated cells that stained intensely for surface IgM appeared in blood within 15 h. Predominantly B lymphocytes contained the viral capsid protein when lymph and blood cells were cultured briefly to allow BLV expression. However, both early in lymph and later in blood, BrdU+ B cells greatly exceeded productively infected cells, indicating that new BLV infections stimulate proliferation of two different populations of B cells...|$|E
40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} in Hawassa town and its surroundings from October 2007 to May 2008 to estimate the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) based on comparative interadermal tuberculin test (CIDT) and abattoir survey. Accordingly, 39 herds comprising 413 cattle were subjected to CIDT, and the herd and individual animal prevalence were 48. 7 % (19 / 39) and 11. 6 % (48 / 413), respectively. One of the 16 milk samples collected from tuberculin-positive cows was culture positive. The prevalence significantly differed among the age group (P = 0. 001) and management system (P = 0. 001). Thus, age group over four (OR = 7. 9) and animal with poor management system (OR = 4. 1) had a higher odds for tuberculin reactivity compared to those with age group under four and cattle with good management system, respectively. Of the total 1, 023 cattle subjected to postmortem examination, 11 (1. 1 %) were found to be positive for gross tuberculous lesions. Larger proportion (50 %) of TB lesion was recorded in the respiratory pathway followed by digestive system (28. 6 %) and <b>prescapular</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (21. 4 %). Of 14 tissue specimens collected from the gross lesions, four (28. 6 %) were positive for histopathological TB lesions.

40|$|Foram examinadas amostras de fígado, rins, baço e linfonodos hepáticos, mesentéricos, retro-mandibulares, pré-escapulares e mediastínicos de 12 lotes em um total de 120 animais, envolvendo diferentes faixas etárias, todos oriundos do Estado de Mato Grosso. Os animais haviam sido mantidos em pastos onde Brachiaria decumbens e Brachiaria brizantha eram as forrageiras predominantes. Macroscopicamente o fígado desses animais mostrava coloração amarelada, mais evidente após 24 horas de fixação em formol a 10 %. Nos linfonodos hepáticos e mesentéricos foram evidenciadas, na superfície de corte, estriações esbranquiçadas de forma radiada na {{cortical}} e medular com pequenas áreas brancas nodulares multifocais principalmente na medular. Em muitos casos, associado com essas áreas foram vistos focos de aspecto hemorrágico. Microscopicamente foram encontradas, no fígado, linfonodos hepáticos e mesentéricos, células com citoplasma espumoso, muitas das quais multinucleadas. Nos linfonodos hepáticos e mesentéricos estes infiltrados estavam associados a áreas de necrose e hemorragia. No fígado, as células de citoplasma espumoso estavam presentes em todo parênquima, de forma irregular, geralmente formando nódulos ao redor da veia centrolobular. Estas células não se coravam pelo ácido periódico de Schiff (PAS) e apenas fracamente na coloração de gordura pelo Oil Red O. Na ultra-estrutura as células de citoplasma espumoso apresentavam fendas, parcial ou totalmente delimitadas por membrana, que representam a imagem negativa de cristais, presentes também no citoplasma dos hepatócitos. Samples of liver, kidney, spleen, and hepatic, mesenteric, retromandibular, <b>prescapular</b> and mediastinic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> {{collected from}} 12 groups of cattle {{of different ages}} from the State of Mato Grosso, were studied. A total of 120 bovines was examined. According to their history, the animals were kept in pastures where Brachiaria decumbens and Brachiaria brizantha were the predominant plants. Grossly there was a yellowish liver which was more evident after 24 hr. fixation with formalin. Hepatic and mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> had normal size, however, on the cut surface there were whitish grooves, extending from the cortex to the medular, and multiple small white nodular areas in the medular. Beside these areas there were red, sometimes hemorrhagic, foci. Microscopically all animals had cells with foamy citoplasm in the liver and in the hepatic and mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> often forming multinucleated cells. In the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> these infiltrates were adjacent to necrotic, hemorrhagic areas. In the liver the foamy cells were irregularly disseminated throughout the parenchyma or formed nodules around the central vein. These cells did not stain with PAS but weakly with oil red. Ultrastructurally foamy cells and hepatocytes showed negative images of crystals involved partially or totally by membranes.
