The title summa cum laude is awarded to graduates who obtain a GWA of 1.20 or above, magna cum laude to graduates with a GWA of 1.45 to 1.20, and cum laude to graduates with a GWA of between 1.75 and 1.45. As of 2011 there have been 30 summa cum laudes who have graduated from UPLB.|$|E
5|$|The shuttle {{has moved}} into direct {{sunlight}} and Mission Control is unable to rotate it into a safe position, putting the astronauts' lives in danger. Generoo believes that the uplink is being sabotaged. Belt orders the uplink to be cut, allowing the astronauts to rotate the craft manually. Over the objections of Generoo and the agents, Belt orders the mission to proceed and lies to the press about its progress. Belt tells Mulder that the shuttle <b>program</b> <b>may</b> be cancelled if the mission is not completed successfully.|$|E
40|$|While theory {{suggests}} that information <b>programs</b> <b>may</b> correct market failures and improve welfare, the empirical impacts of these policies remain undetermined. We show that mandatory disclosure programs in the electricity industry achieve stated policy goals. We find {{that the proportion of}} fossil fuels decreases, and the proportion of clean fuels increases in response to disclosure programs. However, the <b>programs</b> <b>may</b> produce unintended consequences. For example, <b>programs</b> <b>may</b> make "clean" firms cleaner, while leaving "dirty" firms relatively unchanged. If the marginal benefits of pollution abatement are larger at dirty firms than at clean firms, disclosure <b>programs</b> <b>may</b> induce inefficient abatement allocations.

5|$|Woodward {{asserts that}} the U.S. is {{implementing}} a secret killing program in Iraq targeting designated terrorists and that this program in large parts accounts for the significant drop in violence in the country. This <b>program</b> <b>may</b> have been being carried out by Task Force 77. The secrecy surrounding the program can, according to Woodward, in some ways {{be compared to the}} Manhattan Project during World War II in which the atomic bomb was developed amidst an unprecedented veil of secrecy. Following the publication of the book, U.S. National security adviser Stephen Hadley acknowledged the existence of the described strategy.|$|E
5|$|Some Schubert {{performers}} tend to {{play the}} entire trilogy of the last sonatas in a single recital, thereby stressing their interrelatedness, and suggesting that they form a single, complete cycle. However, since each of these sonatas is rather long (as compared, for instance, with most of Mozart's or Beethoven's sonatas), such a <b>program</b> <b>may</b> prove exhausting to some listeners. One of the solutions to this problem is to shorten the program by omitting repeats, mainly those of the opening movements' expositions (however, this practice is highly disputed, as noted above). The pioneers of the Schubert sonata performance, Schnabel and Erdmann, {{are known to have}} played the entire trilogy in one evening; more recently, so did Alfred Brendel, Maurizio Pollini, Mitsuko Uchida, and Paul Lewis.|$|E
5|$|Some reports {{suggested}} that the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle program to replace the M113 family of vehicles was being favored over the GCV program. While procurement of the AMPV fleet would cost over $5 billion, the Government Accountability Office estimated the GCV fleet would cost $37 billion. In April 2013, the Congressional Budget Office said the AMPV {{would be a better}} buy because analysts had asserted that the vehicles the GCV was slated to replace should not be first. The GCV would replace 61 M2 Bradley IFVs per armored combat brigade, making up 18 percent of the 346 armored combat vehicles in each armored brigade. A 24 September 2013 Congressional Research Service report {{suggested that}} given budgetary constraints, the GCV <b>program</b> <b>may</b> be unrealistic, and that one potential discussion could focus on a decision by the Army to replace the GCV with the AMPV as their number one ground combat vehicle acquisition priority.|$|E

5|$|This {{concentration}} is offered {{in partnership with}} Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Pastoral Care Department (RWJUH). Students in the D.Min. concentration in Pastoral Care & Counseling / Pastoral Theology will benefit from advanced theological study and professional work specifically designed for those who desire to serve as chaplains, pastoral care specialists, pastoral counselors or congregational pastors. The program emphasizes the helping relationship, theological understandings of pastoral care, the multicultural contexts of pastoral care, psychotherapeutic theories and strategies for change, and various forms of pastoral care and counseling. A race, class, and gender analysis will be appropriated {{to the practice of}} care and counseling. Questions regarding the <b>program</b> <b>may</b> be directed to Danielle Hunter, Director, D. Min. Concentration in Pastoral Care and Counseling.|$|E
