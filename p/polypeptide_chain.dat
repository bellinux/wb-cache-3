5|$|The {{amino acids}} in a <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chain</b> are linked by peptide bonds. Once linked in the protein chain, an {{individual}} amino acid {{is called a}} residue, and the linked series of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms are known as the main chain or protein backbone.|$|E
5|$|Transfer RNA (tRNA) {{is a small}} RNA {{chain of}} about 80 {{nucleotides}} that transfers a specific amino acid to a growing <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chain</b> at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation. It has sites for amino acid attachment and an anticodon region for codon recognition that binds to a specific sequence on the messenger RNA chain through hydrogen bonding.|$|E
5|$|Translation is {{the process}} by which a mature mRNA {{molecule}} is used as a template for synthesizing a new protein. Translation is carried out by ribosomes, large complexes of RNA and protein responsible for carrying out the chemical reactions to add new amino acids to a growing <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chain</b> by the formation of peptide bonds. The genetic code is read three nucleotides at a time, in units called codons, via interactions with specialized RNA molecules called transfer RNA (tRNA). Each tRNA has three unpaired bases known as the anticodon that are complementary to the codon it reads on the mRNA. The tRNA is also covalently attached to the amino acid specified by the complementary codon. When the tRNA binds to its complementary codon in an mRNA strand, the ribosome attaches its amino acid cargo to the new <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chain,</b> which is synthesized from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus. During and after synthesis, most new proteins must fold to their active three-dimensional structure before they can carry out their cellular functions.|$|E

These carbohydrates branch off of <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chains</b> {{in the form}} of oligosaccharides including N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, fucose, galactose, and sialic acid. The serine and threonine hydroxyl groups link to the <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chains</b> via O-glycosidic linkages.|$|R

5|$|Examples of post-translational {{modification}} include phosphorylation, myristoylation and glycosylation. For example, in {{the response to}} insulin, the phosphorylation of multiple enzymes, including glycogen synthase, helps control the synthesis or degradation of glycogen and allows the cell to respond to changes in blood sugar. Another example of {{post-translational modification}} is the cleavage of the <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chain.</b> Chymotrypsin, a digestive protease, is produced in inactive form as chymotrypsinogen in the pancreas and transported in this form to the stomach where it is activated. This stops the enzyme from digesting the pancreas or other tissues before it enters the gut. This type of inactive precursor to an enzyme {{is known as a}} zymogen or proenzyme.|$|E

5000|$|When {{two or more}} <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chains</b> (either of {{identical}} or of different sequence) cluster to form a protein, quaternary structure of protein is formed. Quaternary structure is an attribute of polymeric (same-sequence chains) or heteromeric (different-sequence chains) proteins like hemoglobin, which consists of two [...] "alpha" [...] and two [...] "beta" [...] <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chains.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{ribosome}} {{has three}} sites for tRNA to bind. They are the aminoacyl site (abbreviated A), the peptidyl site (abbreviated P) and the exit site (abbreviated E). With {{respect to the}} mRNA, the three sites are oriented 5’ to 3’ E-P-A, because ribosomes move toward the 3' end of mRNA. The A site binds the incoming tRNA with the complementary codon on the mRNA. The P site holds the tRNA with the growing <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chain.</b> The E site holds the tRNA without its amino acid. When an aminoacyl-tRNA initially binds to its corresponding codon on the mRNA, {{it is in the}} A site. Then, a peptide bond forms between the amino acid of the tRNA in the A site and the amino acid of the charged tRNA in the P site. The growing <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chain</b> is transferred to the tRNA in the A site. Translocation occurs, moving the tRNA in the P site, now without an amino acid, to the E site; the tRNA that was in the A site, now charged with the <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chain,</b> is moved to the P site. The tRNA in the E site leaves and another aminoacyl-tRNA enters the A site to repeat the process.|$|E
25|$|Many {{proteins}} have a quaternary structure, {{which consists}} of several polypeptide chains that associate into an oligomeric molecule. Each <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chain</b> in such a protein is called a subunit. Hemoglobin, for example, consists of two α and two β subunits. Each of the four chains has an all-α globin fold with a heme pocket.|$|E
40|$|Immunoglobulins of the 7 A-, 7 G-, and 7 M-classes are {{distinguished}} by their heavy <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chains,</b> called ~, 7, and/z respectively, and are related by their common light <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chains</b> (1, 2). Staining of human lymphoid tissue with fluorescent antibody reagents (3) specific for particular <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chains</b> has revealed a striking differentiation of fluorescing cells {{with respect to}} their content of the different classes of heavy (4 - 7) and types of light (7 - 9) immunoglobulin chains. Recent technical improvements in fluorescent antibody procedures have facilitated simultaneous staining with mixtures of fluorescein- and rhodamine-labeled antibodies and the enumeration of lymphoid cells containing each of any two immunoglobulin <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chains</b> (10 - 13, 7, 8). When rabbit lymphoid tissue was stained with antilight chain and anti-~-chain conjugated with contrasting fluorochromes, 63 to 78 % of all fluorescing cells were found to contain both component chains of 7 G-immunoglobulin in detectable amounts (13).

25|$|Modules {{frequently}} display different connectivity relationships, {{as illustrated}} by the kinesins and ABC transporters. The kinesin motor domain can be at either end of a <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chain</b> that includes a coiled-coil region and a cargo domain. ABC transporters are built with up to four domains consisting of two unrelated modules, ATP-binding cassette and an integral membrane module, arranged in various combinations.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin has a {{quaternary}} structure characteristic of many multi-subunit globular proteins. Most of the amino acids in hemoglobin form alpha helices, and these helices are connected by short non-helical segments. Hydrogen bonds stabilize the helical sections inside this protein, causing attractions within the molecule, which then causes each <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chain</b> to fold into a specific shape. Hemoglobin's {{quaternary structure}} comes from its four subunits in roughly a tetrahedral arrangement.|$|E

25|$|The {{potential}} transmembrane {{portions of}} a protein {{can be detected}} by hydropathy analysis. A hydropathy analysis uses an algorithm that quantifies the hydrophobic character at each position along the <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chain.</b> One of the accepted hydropathy scales is that of Kyte and Doolittle which relies on the generation of hydropathy plots. In these plots, the negative numbers represent hydrophilic regions and the positive numbers represent hydrophobic regions on the y-axis. A potential transmembrane domain is about 20 amino acids long on the x-axis.|$|E
25|$|In Figure 5, both ribosomal {{subunits}} (small and large) assemble at {{the start}} codon (towards the 5' end of the RNA). The ribosome uses RNA that matches the current codon (triplet) on the mRNA to append an amino acid to the <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chain.</b> This is done for each triplet on the RNA, while the ribosome moves towards the 3' end of the mRNA. Usually in bacterial cells, several ribosomes are working parallel on a single RNA, forming {{what is called a}} polyribosome or polysome.|$|E
25|$|The β-sheet (also β-pleated sheet) is {{a common}} motif of regular {{secondary}} structure in proteins. Beta sheets consist of beta strands (also β-strand) connected laterally by {{at least two or}} three backbone hydrogen bonds, forming a generally twisted, pleated sheet. A β-strand is a stretch of <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chain</b> typically 3 to 10 amino acids long with backbone in an extended conformation. The supramolecular association of β-sheets has been implicated in formation of the protein aggregates and fibrils observed in many human diseases, notably the amyloidoses such as Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

The two types of light chains are kappa (κ) and lambda (λ). By cleavage with enzyme papain, the Fab (fragment-antigen binding) part can {{be separated from the}} Fc (fragment constant) part of the molecule. The Fab fragments contain the variable domains, which consist of three antibody hypervariable amino acid domains responsible for the antibody specificity embedded into constant regions. The four known IgG subclasses are involved in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|The overall 3D {{structure}} of the <b>polypeptide</b> <b>chain</b> {{is referred to as}} the protein's tertiary structure. Domains are the fundamental units of tertiary structure, each domain containing an individual hydrophobic core built from secondary structural units connected by loop regions. The packing of the polypeptide is usually much tighter in the interior than the exterior of the domain producing a solid-like core and a fluid-like surface. Core residues are often conserved in a protein family, whereas the residues in loops are less conserved, unless they are involved in the protein's function. Protein tertiary structure can be divided into four main classes based on the secondary structural content of the domain.|$|E
