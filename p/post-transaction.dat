50|$|<b>Post-transaction</b> {{marketing}} is a deceptive marketing practice {{used by many}} companies, which have then been subject to investigation, charges from state attorneys general, and class action lawsuits.|$|E
50|$|Classmates.com {{was accused}} of {{piggybacking}} and <b>post-transaction</b> marketing. Parent company United Online earned $70 million from marketing practices under investigation in 2009 by the Senate Commerce Committee involving piggybacking a second credit card transaction with membership to Classmates.com involving a loyalty program.|$|E
50|$|In July 2009, it was {{revealed}} that Fandango along with other web sites, including buy.com and Orbitz, were linked with controversial Web loyalty programs, also known as <b>post-transaction</b> marketers. Fandango reportedly gave access to their customers' credit cards to the third party.|$|E
50|$|Intelius {{received}} {{thousands of}} consumer complaints regarding <b>post-transaction</b> marketing practices and allegedly deceptive credit card charges. The Washington Attorney General sued Intelius and a $1.3 million settlement was reached in August 2010. In November 2011 {{the company announced}} the inclusion of TrueRep to its services. This program allows consumers to provide explanations for any indiscretions on their records.|$|E
50|$|A Supplemental Staff Report {{released}} in May 2010 starts {{the exploration of}} efforts by <b>post-transaction</b> marketers to avoid refunds. One of these efforts is using scripts, which are in place {{in order to minimize}} the amount returned to consumers and refused to refund, unless the consumer specifically demands a refund. Another practice is to deliberately avoid informing consumers that they have multiple memberships, even when they call to report one such membership.|$|E
5000|$|It also {{reported}} that <b>post-transaction</b> marketers will pay a 10-30 USD [...] "bounty" [...] for a customer's enrollment in a membership club. The report also identified low consumer awareness of their involuntary memberships to these clubs, and cites numerous consumer complaints. It also presents companies' training scripts for customer service staff response to such complaints, especially those from individuals unaware of their enrollment. It also identifies high cancellation rates as evidence that these subscriptions were unwanted.|$|E

The Company was listed on NYSE under GFIG until March 2015.|$|E
5000|$|According to a United States Senate staff report, this {{practice}} presents [...] "highly aggressive sales tactics which charge millions of American consumers for services the consumers {{do not want}} and do not understand they have purchased." [...] It reports that consumers involuntarily spent 1.4 billion USD due to these practices, 792 million USD of that paid to the third-party sites which presented services paid for by <b>post-transaction</b> marketing. The report concluded that such marketing practices [...] "exploit consumers' expectations about the online 'checkout' process." [...] It stated that their [...] "Misleading 'Yes' and 'Continue' buttons cause consumers to reasonably think they are completing the original transaction, rather than entering into a new, ongoing financial relationship with a membership club." ...|$|E
5000|$|In July 2009, CNET {{revealed}} that Orbitz, {{along with other}} popular consumer websites Buy.com and Fandango, have been routinely giving <b>post-transaction</b> marketers access to their customers' credit cards. The Senate Commerce Committee investigating these companies has described their services as a [...] "scam". The scam works by charging a monthly fee (many users report a $12 charge from Reservation Rewards or Webloyalty showing up on their credit card statements) that is piggybacked with the Orbitz sale (as it stands, Orbitz Terms of Service agreement currently allows them to share customers' credit card information with third parties for their own uses). Orbitz ended its affiliation with the controversial marketer and does not share consumer credit card information with third parties.|$|E

5000|$|In March 2000, Diageo’s chief {{operating}} officer contacted General Mills’ chairman and CEO to explore a possible sale of Pillsbury. General Mills submitted its proposed deal terms to Diageo in June 2000—the total proposed payment was $10.0 billion. Diageo submitted an asking price of $10.5 billion. The two sides would budge no further, and {{it looked as if}} the negotiations wouldfounder. General Mills did not want to issue more than one-third of its <b>post-transaction</b> shares to Diageo, and believed that its shares were undervalued in the stock market. Diageo believed it was necessary to value General Mills’ shares at the current trading prices. In an effort to bridge the difference in positions, the two firms agreed upon including in the terms of the deal a contingent payment on {{the first anniversary of the}} transaction that would depend on General Mills’ share price. James Lawrence, chief financial officer of General Mills, said, “We genuinely believe this is a way in which they could have their cake and we could eat it, too. There’s no question in my mind that, absent this instrument, we wouldn’t have been able to reach this deal.” ...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} going private {{transactions in}} Europe examining both the market reaction around the acquisition announcement and the <b>post-transaction</b> performance. The existence of large controlling shareholders, in particular families, permits to examine going private deals {{initiated by the}} company’s controlling shareholder. We find that CARs around going private announcements are negatively related to the stake held by its largest shareholder. The market reaction around the going private announcement is also negatively related to the company’s stock price performance before the announcement, supporting the undervaluation hypothesis. When the largest shareholder, particularly a family, takes her firms private, this affects positively <b>post-transaction</b> operating performance. Conversely, firms taken private by new owners experience worse operating performance. We also compare UK to non-UK going private: UK deals have higher returns for target shareholders, but worse <b>post-transaction</b> performance. Using a LBO to delist the company impacts neither on abnormal returns nor operating performance. JEL Classification: G 3...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequent}} things we do as consumers is make purchase. We pay for a coffee or for food, we pay for necessities around the house, we even pay for one another, buying drinks or dinner for a friend every now and then. In today’s marketplace, the decision of whether to purchase is also coupled with the decision of {{how to make a}} purchase. Consumers have so many different methods to pay for their transactions. Can the way a consumer chooses to pay change the likelihood that s/he make a purchase? And then post-purchase, can the payment method used to pay for a purchase influence how connected individuals feel to that product, brand, or organization? Given that we sometimes pay for others (and vice versa), can the way we pay influence our interpersonal relationships? In what follows, I argue that the way individuals pay, and specifically the pain associated with making a payment, can have a pervasive effect on their decision to make a purchase and how they feel <b>post-transaction.</b> Across three essays, I focus on how the pain of paying can influence the likelihood to purchase an item from a consideration set (Essay 1) and subsequently, how the pain of paying can influence <b>post-transaction</b> connection to a product, organization, or even to other people (Essay 2 and 3). Across field, laboratory, online, and archival methods, I find robust evidence that increasing the pain of paying may initially deter individuals from choosing. However, <b>post-transaction,</b> increasing the pain of payment may have an upside: individuals feel closer and more committed to a product that they purchased, organization that they donated to, and feel greater connection and rapport to who they spent their money on. However, I also demonstrate the boundary conditions of these findings. When individuals are spending money on something that is undesirable, such as paying for a competitor, increasing the pain of payment decreases interpersonal connection and rapport.

40|$|Reputation and {{feedback}} systems in online marketplaces are often biased, {{making it difficult}} to ascertain the quality of sellers. We use <b>post-transaction,</b> buyer-to-seller message traffic to detect signals of unsatis-factory transactions on eBay. We posit that a message sent after the item was paid for serves as a reliable indicator that the buyer may be unhappy with that purchase, particularly when the message included words associated with a negative experience. The fraction of a seller’s message traffic that was negative predicts whether a buyer who transacts with this seller will stop purchasing on eBay, implying that platforms can use these messages as an additional signal of seller quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the present study was to examine store {{attributes}} as a signal for the process of building a customer-retailer relationship in the context of department store operation. DeWulf et al. 2 ̆ 7 s Model of Retailer-Customer Exchange Relationship, social exchange theory, and signalling theory provided the theoretical frameworks for this respective study. Specific objectives of this study were: (1) to explore store attributes influencing consumer 2 ̆ 7 s perceived relationship investment when store attributes serve as investment signals retailer sends to customer; (2) to test the associations among relationship investment, relationship quality, and loyalty; and (3) to examine the mediating effect of relationship quality on the relationship investment – loyalty link. To that end, an online survey was performed. ^ The results revealed six store attributes related to department store environments: <b>post-transaction</b> service, direct mail, interpersonal communication, merchandise, preferential treatment, and store atmosphere, and among them, five store attributes (<b>post-transaction</b> service, direct mail, interpersonal communication, merchandise, and preferential treatment) were positively associated with perceived relationship investment. Further, relationship investment was found to be positively related with relationship quality, which in turn was positively related to both behavioral and attitudinal loyalty. The findings also revealed that perceived relationship quality mediates the relationship between relationship investment and loyalty. ^ The present study provides theoretical and practical implications. The empirical evidence of the effects of store attributes on customer-retailer relationship building contributes to the literature in retailing and relationship marketing fields. The findings of the present study also help retailers enhance customer relationships by investing on target store attributes. ...|$|E
40|$|In today's {{volatile}} economy, {{innovation in}} providing interactive services to consumers {{through a variety}} of channels is critical in retailing. Interactive service innovations offer opportunities for retailers by creating new markets or offering new benefits in existing markets. They also pose threats as existing customers encounter new alternatives offered by competitors. This article explores some of the most promising opportunities in interactive retail services; namely, the increasing power of consumers, channel synergies, pre- and <b>post-transaction</b> service, optimal use of resources, and consumer heterogeneity. In discussing these areas of opportunity we identify knowledge gaps and suggest research questions relevant to these gaps that warrant attention.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} a vibrant and {{economically}} important public-to-private market has reemerged in the US, UK and Continental Europe, since {{the second half of}} the 1990 s. The paper shows recent trends and investigates the motives for public-to-private and LBO transactions. The reasons for the potential sources of shareholder wealth effects during the transaction period are examined: a distinction is made between tax benefits, incentive realignment, transaction costs savings, stakeholder expropriation, takeover defenses and corporate undervaluation. The paper also attempts to relate these value drivers to the <b>post-transaction</b> value and to the duration of the private status. Finally, the paper draws some conclusions about whether or not public-to-private transactions are useful devices for corporate restructuring. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Bitcoin is {{designed}} to protect user anonymity (or pseudonymity) in a financial transaction, and has been increasingly adopted by major e-commerce websites such as Dell, PayPal and Expedia. While the anonymity of Bitcoin transactions has been extensively studied, {{little attention has been}} paid to the security of <b>post-transaction</b> correspondence. In a commercial ap-plication, the merchant and the user often need to engage in follow-up corre-spondence after a Bitcoin transaction is completed, e. g., to acknowledge the receipt of payment, to confirm the billing address, to arrange the product de-livery, to discuss refund and so on. Currently, such follow-up correspondence is typically done in plaintext via email with no guarantee on confidentiality. Obviously, leakage of sensitive data from the correspondence (e. g., billing ad-dress) can trivially compromise the anonymity of Bitcoin users. In this paper, we initiate the first study on how to realise end-to-end secure communica-tion between Bitcoin users in a <b>post-transaction</b> scenario without requiring any trusted third party or additional authentication credentials. This is an important new area that has not been covered by any IEEE or ISO/IEC se-curity standard, as none of the existing PKI-based or password-based AKE schemes are suitable for the purpose. Instead, our idea is to leverage the Bit-coin’s append-only ledger as an additional layer of authentication between previously confirmed transactions. This naturally leads to a new category of AKE protocols that bootstrap trust entirely from the block chain. We call this new category “Bitcoin-based AKE ” and present two concrete protocols: one is non-interactive with no forward secrecy, while the other is interactive with additional guarantee of forward secrecy. Finally, we present proof-of-concept prototypes for both protocols with experimental results to demonstrate their practical feasibility...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The Internet {{revolution}} {{has led to}} {{significant changes in the}} way travel agencies interact with customers. Travel websites are used to different degrees, and for a variety of combinations of pre-transaction, transaction and <b>post-transaction</b> services. A better understanding of how customers interact with online services will help providers improve service quality to levels that satisfy or even delight customers, and thus create loyalty. This article provides a comprehensive review of the literature on online service quality, applies the theory to online travel offerings, and reports on an empirical study of quality perceptions of pre-transaction services provided on three travel websites. Effects on customer perceived quality were measured for process and outcome dimensions of online services. Implications for the design of online travel services and suggestions for further research are formulated. ...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{globalisation}} creates {{new possibilities}} for sourcing from {{low cost countries}} (LCC), but also comes {{with a range of}} logistics challenges and issues to be dealt with. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate how logistics and its impacts are considered in LCC sourcing decisions. An exploratory multiple case study of industrial product companies engaged in distant LCC sourcing serves as an empirical base. Findings reveal that firms do not explicitly take logistics into account during LCC sourcing decisions. Even if logistics is considered, it is generally in a reactive way and takes a transactional cost focus. Instead, we propose a framework to proactively consider logistics factors in the early stages of LCC sourcing. This is done through identifying product and supplier related logistics factors and their impact on pre-transaction, transaction and <b>post-transaction</b> elements in the Total Cost of Ownership model...|$|E

A majority of studies on pairs trading yielded positive risk adjusted returns and it is not yet certain if a similar performance can be attained in Malaysia. Evidence from this study generally indicates positive risk adjusted performance using <b>post-transaction</b> costs data. The superior performance is more pronounced prior to accounting for transaction costs. There is no evidence to suggest industry homogeneity in pairs trading improves portfolio performance. Risk management techniques and their potential impact on the performance of the strategy are debatable based on prior studies.

I also test the market's ability in discriminating between those management buy-in targets that fail or succeed subsequent to going private and find that the markets are in fact capable of predicting failures and successes {{at the time of}} the announcement of these bids. The results reveal that {{the involvement of}} LBO-Associations improves the chances of <b>post-transaction</b> success, and that MBIs that subsequently fail do not underperform their industrial peers prior to the bid, they were simply over-priced by the bidders. The bidding teams who bought into these failing MBIs, those which the markets deemed unsuitable, were simply faced with the winner's curse and had over-estimated their abilities in bringing about substantial improvements within the management of these targets.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{research}} how M&A transactions affect R&D and CAPEX investments amount. Results in the prior literature regarding the subject are somewhat mixed {{and most of the}} studies are based on US data. I regress also how similarities between acquirer and target company affect the outcome of investment activity changes due to M&A deals. In addition, I investigate further whether financial crisis has had an impact on R&D and CAPEX investment changes in the M&A context. My test sample consists of transactions made between European publicly listed companies during pre-financial crisis period 2003 - 2005 and post-financial crisis period 2010 - 2012. I have also separate control sample including firms, which have not participated in M&A transactions, to test differences between test and control sample. Data of M&A transactions is gathered from SDC Platinum database and financial data of acquirers, targets and control group companies is obtained from Thomson ONE Banker and Orbis databases. In my analyses I have compared pre-transaction year values to one [- 1, + 1] and two [- 1, + 2] year <b>post-transaction</b> values. The data is analyzed by using comparison of means, t-tests, correlation and linear regression methods. Findings of my study indicate that M&A deals have had positive effect on R&D investments amount <b>post-transaction.</b> Result is against my hypothesis and prior results of e. g. Hitt et al. (1991), but somewhat consistent with Cassiman et al. (2005) findings. Furthermore, I do not find support that similarities regarding same home country or industry of acquirer or target would have significant impact on R&D investments development in the M&A context. According to my results, neither financial crisis has affected R&D activity. My results regarding CAPEX investments change due to M&A transactions are relatively similar as with R&D investments. First, I achieve mixed results whether M&A deals have had effect on CAPEX investments and thus my findings are close to Healy et al. (1992) results. Second, I do not find support that similarities would affect significantly CAPEX intensity's change. Finally, I discover only minor support for hypothesis that financial crisis would have had negative impact on capital expenditures change...|$|E
40|$|Performing payment {{transactions}} {{over the}} Internet {{is becoming increasingly}} important. Whenever one interacts with others, he or she faces the problem of uncertainty because in interacting with others, one makes him or herself vulnerable, i. e. one can be betrayed. Thus, perceived risk and confidence are of fundamental importance in electronic payment transactions. A higher risk leads to greater hesitance about entering into a business relationship {{with a high degree}} of uncertainty; and therefore, to an increased need for confidence. This paper has two objectives. First, it aims to introduce and test a theoretical model that predicts consumer and merchant acceptance of the Internet payment solution by explaining the complex set of relationships among the key factors influencing confidence in electronic payment transactions. Second, the paper attempts to shed light on the complex interrelationship among confidence, control and perceived risk. An empirical study was conducted to test the proposed model using data from consumers and merchants in Slovenia. The results show how perceived risk dimensions and <b>post-transaction</b> control influence consumer’s and merchant’s confidence in electronic payment transactions, and the impact of confidence on the adoption of mass-market on-line payment solutions...|$|E

The acquisition activity is shown at two levels. In the basic level the numbers of transactions in each country were compared according to freely selected criteria. In the next level, the research deals with the existence of a relationship between the acquisition activity and macroeconomic indicators. The research study presents in detail three new economic indicators for comparison of acquisition activity: M-total, M-score, M-index. The second question that my research addresses is the percentage of successful and unsuccessful deals in the Czech Republic. My research evaluating acquisitions & mergers is based on the financial results. Financial results are looked at from three aspects according to how they may benefit specific interest groups: owners, creditors, employees. The next issue is a verdict on which firms, in terms of financial results in the pre-transaction period, have potential for successful development in the <b>post-transaction</b> period, and which seem to have no potential.

40|$|In {{this article}} is {{examined}} the relationship between store image, individual factors and consumer purchase behavior. First link is made between consumer attitudes and his buying decisions. Second, the relationship between store image and consumer purchase behavior is mediated by attributes of retailer that include merchandising, store atmosphere, in-store service, accessibility, reputation, promotion, facilities and <b>post-transaction</b> service. This article is a theoretical approach on what is known about how people {{decide whether or not to}} buy something and then how they decide which item or items to buy and what retailer is the best choice. In the process of doing this, we will discover that the process of making a buying decision is not nearly as simply as it may seem. A good understanding about how consumers make buying decisions is very important in developing effective marketing plans. Marketers can change the design of the store interior, aisle layout, carpet and wall textures, scents, colors, shapes, and sounds experienced by the customers. Thus store image is a result of many variables which can be manipulated by the retailer to influence consumer mood and, subsequently, the buyer's behavior...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} how ownership structures affect going-private transactions in Europe. We examine both market reactions around the acquisition announcements and <b>post-transaction</b> performance, {{and we find}} that CARs around going-private announcements are negatively related to the stake held by its largest shareholder. The market reaction around the goingprivate announcement is also negatively related to the company’s stock price performance before the announcement, supporting the undervaluation hypothesis. The existence of large controlling shareholders allows us to investigate deals initiated by the company’s controlling shareholder. When the largest shareholder, particularly a family, takes a firm private, posttransaction operating performances are better than those of firms taken private by new owners, which experience significant worsening in profitability. We also compare the U. K. to non-U. K. going private: U. K. deals have higher returns for target shareholders, but worse posttransaction performance. We find that using an LBO to delist the company impacts neither abnormal returns nor operating performance. Finally, firms go private to restructure their workforce, {{in terms of both}} employee number and cost. This has a positive impact on the firm’s productivity and efficiency, increasing the profit for employees. JEL Classification: G 3...|$|E

However, quality of in store services is the most significant challengeleading towards negative acuity, about retail stores. Also retail stores need to aggressively work on improving the store atmosphereespecially the shopping atmosphere and the post transaction services for the return and exchange procedures.

40|$|Automotive {{industry}} has faced intense consolidation pressure, which has lead to {{increasing number of}} M&As. However, empirical evidence has given controversial results suggesting that most of M&As are value destructive for acquiring companies and for acquiring companies’ shareholders. The objective of this master’s thesis is to examine how acquiring companies’ shareholders react to acquisition announcement and is the reaction {{in line with the}} long-term performance. This study uses empirical evidence from automotive industry, which has been characterized as an industry that holds large amount of vertical and horizontal synergies. Transaction data consists of 65 acquisitions made by publicly listed companies between 2008 - 2010. The short-term impact is tested by applying event study methodology while the long term operative performance is examined with accounting study methodology. The event study results indicate that during the three days after acquisition (t= 0 - 2), the acquiring firms’ stocks generate an abnormal return of 1. 22 % on average across all acquisitions. When long term performance is studied it is evident that acquiring companies perform better than the industry median pre- and <b>post-transaction</b> but there is no statistically significant evidence that the performance has increased. The only performance ratio indicating statistically significant decrease is Return on Equity (ROE). On long-term horizontal acquisitions seem to outperform conglomerate ones but otherwise deal characteristics do not have any statistically significant impact...|$|E
40|$|In the {{background}} of domestic boom and economic turmoil, Chinese automotive corporations are seeking their opportunities to grow globally. Outbound Mergers and Acquisitions are {{regarded as one of}} the most effective method to achieve their internationalisation goals for Chinese automakers. This research paper examines and explores the Chinese automotive corporations' outbound M&As in the perspectives of motives, drivers, benefits and drawbacks for the Chinese automotive manufacturers‘ cross-border M&As through the single case study of Sichuan Tengzhong‘s acquisition of Hummer brand from GM. By analysing the case study, motives and drivers of Chinese automotive companies could be concluded in the country-specific, industry-specific and company-specific level. Chinese economy taking off and government supports account for the country level incentives. While, the industry level motives and drivers indicate the fierce competition in Chinese automotive industry. In the company-specific level, technology sourcing, market quick entrance, brand value and recognition, and the previous M&A knowledge are the main five incentives for Chinese automakers in their outbound M&As. For the benefits, drawbacks and difficulties in the perspective of Chinese automotive manufacturers, benefits are part of those incentives as sophisticated technology, quick market access, and brand value and shift. Drawbacks and difficulties includes the Chinese government role, over valuation and pricing, poor <b>post-transaction</b> management, lack of strategic future plans, and the economic crisis recently. With the research discussions and findings, this dissertation hopes to reveal and increase the level of the reader‘s knowledge of the outbound M&As from Chinese automotive companies...|$|E
