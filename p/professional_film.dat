500|$|Several <b>professional</b> <b>film</b> {{critics have}} allotted {{a variety of}} {{different}} terms and nicknames to the animals who appear during the [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] sequence. Neil Smith of BBC Online described the animals who appear during the scene as [...] "a grotesque menagerie of CG vermin", while the Orlando Sentinels Roger Moore jokingly referred to them as New York's own [...] "woodland creatures", writing, [...] "the rats and pigeons are merely the cuddlier ones".

500|$|Harmáček {{felt that}} {{altering}} the films {{in this way}} constituted [...] "an act of cultural vandalism", and in 2010 was inspired to create his own series of fan edits that restored the theatrical releases in high definition.

Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), she starred in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995).

500|$|For Apt Pupil, Bryan Singer filmed {{a shower}} {{scene in which}} Todd Bowden, {{saturated}} with horrific stories from Kurt Dussander, imagines his fellow showering students as Jewish prisoners in gas chambers. The scene was filmed at Eliot Middle School in Altadena, California on April2, 1997, and two weeks later, a 14-year-old extra filed a lawsuit alleging that Singer forced him and other extras to strip naked for the scene. Two boys, 16 and 17 years old, later supported the 14-year-old's claim. [...] The boys claimed trauma from the experience, seeking charges against the filmmakers including infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and invasion of privacy. Allegations were made that the boys were filmed for sexual gratification. The local news shows and national tabloid programs stirred the controversy. [...] A sexual crimes task force that included local, state, and federal personnel investigated the incident. The Los Angeles District Attorney's office determined {{that there was no}} cause to file criminal charges, stating, [...] "The suspects were intent on completing a <b>professional</b> <b>film</b> as quickly and efficiently as possible. There is no indication of lewd or abnormal sexual intent." [...] The civil case was dismissed due to insufficient evidence. The scene was filmed again with adult actors so the film could finish on time.|$|E
