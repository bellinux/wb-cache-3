The results of this study show elevated levels of primary pollutants (CO, SO₂ and NO[sub x sup *]), which are about 1 – 5 times of those typically found in rural areas of North America and Europe. O₃ pollution events are frequently observed. CO and SO₂ levels are particularly high, resulting from the unique energy-use pattern in China. O₃ shows strong positive correlation with NO[sub x sup *] and CO during periods of high photochemical activity. The O₃-NO[sub x sup *] slope is comparable to the result from rural North America, but the O₃-CO slope is substantially smaller for the Chinese site.

We {{apply it to}} the integrated Luxembourg Energy Air Quality assessment model for the urban and regional scale. National aggregated sectoral emissions of <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> are computed by an energy model which minimises {{the cost of the}} reference energy system. The model describes five sectors, i. e. agriculture, transport, industry, residential and commercial at five-year periods. The sectoral emissions are spatially allocated to obtain hourly to daily emission maps. The air quality model simulates the dispersion of the emitted pollutants and their chemical reactions to produce ozone for typical episodes for each five-year period. Both models are coupled by an Oracle Based Optimisation Engine (OBOE) to find the optimal energy system with a constraint on ozone concentrations. When disag-gregating emissions from the national to the urban scale, small scale variation and its associated uncertainty within and across land-use boundaries have to be modelled to obtain realistic emission maps.

The resulting model revealed that PRC had significant direct impact on GLO concentration but very small overall effect. This is because PRC had significant indirect negative impact on GLO via MP.

In this paper, the spatial-temporal distributions of major air pollutants in Shenzhen from March 2013 to February 2014 are discussed. In this study, ground-site monitoring data from 19 monitoring sites was used and spatial interpolation and spatial autocorrelation methods {{were applied to}} analyze both spatial and temporal characteristics of air pollutants in Shenzhen City. During the study period, the daily average concentrations of Particulate Matter (PM 10 and PM 2. 5) ranged from 16 – 189 μg/m 3 and 10 – 136 μg/m 3, respectively, with 13 and 44 over-limit days, indicating that particulate matter was the <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> in Shenzhen.

Fewer studies have focused on cities that are slightly polluted. Shenzhen used to have a favorable air environment, but its air quality has deteriorated gradually as a result of development in recent years. So far, no systematic investigations have been conducted on the adverse effects of air pollution on public health in Shenzhen. This research has applied a time series analysis model to study the possible association between different types of air pollution and respiratory hospital admission in Shenzhen in 2013. Respiratory hospital admission was divided into two categories for comparison analysis among various population groups: acute upper respiratory infection and acute lower respiratory infection. The results showed that short-term exposure to ambient air pollution was significantly associated with acute respiratory infection hospital admission in Shenzhen in 2013.

40|$|Marine {{atmosphere}} is usually {{considered to be}} a clean environment, while this study indicates that the near-coast waters of South China Sea (SCS) suffered from even worse air quality than coastal cities. The analyses were based on concurrent field measurements of target <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> and meteorological parameters conducted at a suburban site (TC) and a nearby marine site (WS) from August to November 2013. The observations showed that the levels of <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> were significantly lower at WS than those at TC, while ozone (O 3) value was greater at WS. Higher O 3 levels at WS were attributed to the weaker NO titration and higher O 3 production rate because of stronger oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. However, O 3 episodes were concurrently observed at both sites under certain meteorological conditions, such as tropical cyclones, continental anticyclones and sea-land breezes (SLBs). Driven by these synoptic systems and mesoscale recirculations, the interaction between continental and marine air masses had profoundly changed the atmospheric composition and subsequently influenced the formation and redistribution of O 3 in the coastal areas. When continental air intruded into marine atmosphere, the O 3 pollution was magnified over SCS, and the elevated O 3 (>  100  ppbv) could overspread the sea boundary layer ~  8 times the area of Hong Kong. In some cases, the exaggerated O 3 pollution over the SCS was re-circulated to the coastal inshore by sea breeze, leading to even aggravating O 3 pollution in coastal cities.

Methodology {{is to use}} SO 2 as a raw material to produce valuable chemicals while purifying the flue gas. Two approaches that use SO 2 in the flue gas were put forward and examined. In the first approach, SO 2 was used to recover acetic acid and lactic acid from the biological process. The second approach converted SO 2 to SO 3 through oxidation with iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3) as catalyst. The experimental results of acetic and lactic acid recovery showed that both the reaction time and breakthrough time decreased {{with the increase of}} reaction temperature and SO 2 flow rate. Analysis of the produced acetic and lactic acids demonstrated that the complete conversion of organic calcium salts to corresponding organic acids was not affected by the reaction conditions. The findings of this study indicated that recovering acetic acid and lactic acid with SO 2 is both economical and environmentally beneficial. The oxidation of SO 2 was greatly enhanced by either microscale or nanoscale Fe 2 O 3 according to the experiment results. Nanoscale Fe 2 O 3 performed much better than its microscale counterpart in catalyzing the SO 2 oxidation. The conversion of SO 2 was temperature dependent for both types of Fe 2 O 3.

The measured yields of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) arising from the photooxidation of naphthalene varied from 6 - 20 %, depending on the concentrations of naphthalene and nitrogen oxides as well as relative humidity. A range of carbonyls, nitro-compounds, phenols and carboxylic acids were identified among the gas- and particle-phase products. On-line analysis of the chemical composition of naphthalene SOA was performed using aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ATOFMS) for the first time. The results indicate that enhanced formation of carboxylic acids {{may contribute to the}} observed increase in SOA yields at higher relative humidity. The photolysis of phthaldialdehyde and 1 -nitronaphthalene was investigated using natural light at the European Photoreactor (EUPHORE) in Valencia, Spain. The photolysis rate coefficients were measured directly and used to confirm that photolysis is the major atmospheric loss process for these compounds. For phthaldialdehyde, the main gas-phase products were phthalide and phthalic anhydride. SOA yields in the range 2 - 11 % were observed, with phthalic acid and dihydroxyphthalic acid identified among the particle phase products. The photolysis of 1 -nitronaphthalene yielded nitric oxide and a naphthoxy radical which reacted to form several products. SOA yields in the range 57 - 71 % were observed, with 1, 4 -naphthoquinone, 1 -naphthol and 1, 4 -naphthalenediol identified in the particle phase. On-line analysis of the SOA generated in an indoor chamber using ATOFMS provided evidence for the formation of high-molecular-weight products. Further investigations revealed that these products are oxygenated polycyclic compounds most likely produced from the dimerization of naphthoxy radicals. These results of this work indicate that naphthalene is a potentially large source of SOA in urban areas and should be included in atmospheric models. The kinetic and mechanistic information could be combined with existing literature data to produce an overall degradation mechanism for naphthalene suitable for inclusion in photochemical models that are used to predict the effect of emissions on air quality...|$|E

Only a few studies have attempted to analyse particulate matter (PM) for the vibrant economic centre Shenzhen in the Pearl River Delta. So far no systematic investigation of PM spatiotemporal patterns in Shenzhen has been undertaken and the understanding of pollution exposure in urban agglomerations with comparatively low pollution is still limited. Methods We analyze daily and hourly particulate matter concentrations and all-cause mortality during 2013 in Shenzhen, China. Temporal patterns of PM (PM 2. 5 and PM 10) with aerodynamic diameters of 2. 5 (10) μm or less (or less (including particles with a diameter that equals to 2. 5 (10) μm) are studied, along with the ratio of PM 2. 5 to PM 10. Spatial distributions of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 are addressed and associations of PM 10 or PM 2. 5 and all-cause mortality are analyzed. Results Annual average PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations were 61. 3 and 39. 6  μg/m 3 in 2013. PM 2. 5 failed to meet the Class 2 annual limit of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard. PM 2. 5 was the <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutant,</b> with 8. 8  % of days having heavy PM 2. 5 pollution. The daily PM 2. 5 /PM 10 ratios were high. Hourly PM 2. 5 concentrations in the tourist area were lower than downtown throughout the day. PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations were higher in western parts of Shenzhen than in eastern parts. Excess risks in the number of all-cause mortality with a 10  μg/m 3 increase of PM were 0. 61  % (95  % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 50 – 0. 72) for PM 10, and 0. 69  % (95  % CI: 0. 55 – 0. 83) for PM 2. 5, respectively. The greatest ERs of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 were in 2 -day cumulative measures for the all-cause mortality, 2 -day lag for females and the young (0 – 65 years), and L 02 for males and the elder (> 65  years). PM 2. 5 had higher risks on all-cause mortality than PM 10. Effects of high PM pollution on mortality were stronger in the elder and male. Conclusions Our findings provide additional relevant information on air quality monitoring and associations of PM and human health, valuable data for further scientific research in Shenzhen and for the on-going discourse on improving environmental policies...|$|E

Apart from the PN peaks appeared in traffic rush hours (i. e. 08 : 00 - 09 : 00 and 17 : 00 - 18 : 00), a distinct peak of PN concentrations in the afternoon (11 : 00 - 16 : 00) was observed during the sampling period. Concurrent measurement data of PSD, ozone (O- 3) and proxy sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) concentrations revealed that the afternoon peaks observed were likely due to new particle formation (NPF) via photochemical reactions. These NPF events were frequently observed under a clean and dry weather in Hong Kong. The occurrence of NPF was closely associated with high solar radiation (SR), low relative humidity (RH) and low condensation sink (CS) in the atmosphere. Besides the NPF events, we also found four nucleation mode particle burst events, typically with increased number concentrations of nucleation mode particles (N-nuc) without growth to larger size particles.

In a multiyear application in Atlanta, R-LINE simulations overestimated concentrations and spatial gradients compared to measurements. In this study we present a computationally efficient procedure for calculating annual average spatial fields and develop an approach for calibrating R-LINE concentrations with observational data. Simulated hourly concentrations of PM 2. 5, CO and NOx from mobile sources at 250  m resolution in the 20 -county Atlanta area based on average diurnal emission profiles and meteorological categories were used to estimate annual averages. Compared to mobile source PM 2. 5 impacts estimated by chemical mass balance with gas constraints (CMB-GC), a source apportionment model based on PM 2. 5 speciation measurements, R-LINE estimates of traffic-generated PM 2. 5 impacts {{were found to be}} higher by a factor of 1. 8 on average across all sites. Compared to observations of daily 1  h maximum CO and NOx, R-LINE estimates were higher by factors of 1. 3 and 4. 2 on average, respectively. Annual averages estimated by R-LINE were calibrated by regression with observations from 2002 to 2011  at multiple sites for daily 1  h maximum CO and NOx and with measurement-based mobile source impacts estimated by CMB-GC for PM 2. 5. The calibration reduced normalized mean bias (NMB) from 29 % to 0. 3 % for PM 2. 5, from 22 % to − 1 % for CO, and from 303 % to 49 % for NOx. Cross-validation analysis (withholding sites one at a time) leads to NMB of 13 %, 1 %, and 69 % for PM 2. 5, CO, and NOx, respectively. The observation-calibrated R-LINE annual average spatial fields were compared with pollutant fields from observation-blended, 12  km resolution Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model fields for CO and NOx, with Pearson correlation R 2 values of 0. 55 for CO and 0. 54 for NOx found.

Only a few studies have attempted to analyse particulate matter (PM) for the vibrant economic centre Shenzhen in the Pearl River Delta. So far no systematic investigation of PM spatiotemporal patterns in Shenzhen has been undertaken and the understanding of pollution exposure in urban agglomerations with comparatively low pollution is still limited. Methods: We analyze daily and hourly particulate matter concentrations and all-cause mortality during 2013 in Shenzhen, China. Temporal patterns of PM (PM 2. 5 and PM 10) with aerodynamic diameters of 2. 5 (10) μm or less (or less (including particles with a diameter that equals to 2. 5 (10) μm) are studied, along with the ratio of PM 2. 5 to PM 10. Spatial distributions of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 are addressed and associations of PM 10 or PM 2. 5 and all-cause mortality are analyzed. Results: Annual average PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations were 61. 3 and 39. 6 μg/m 3 in 2013. PM 2. 5 failed to meet the Class 2 annual limit of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard. PM 2. 5 was the <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutant,</b> with 8. 8 % of days having heavy PM 2. 5 pollution. The daily PM 2. 5 /PM 10 ratios were high. Hourly PM 2. 5 concentrations in the tourist area were lower than downtown throughout the day. PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations were higher in western parts of Shenzhen than in eastern parts. Excess risks in the number of all-cause mortality with a 10 μg/m 3 increase of PM were 0. 61 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 50 – 0. 72) for PM 10, and 0. 69 % (95 % CI: 0. 55 – 0. 83) for PM 2. 5, respectively. The greatest ERs of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 were in 2 -day cumulative measures for the all-cause mortality, 2 -day lag for females and the young (0 – 65 years), and L 02 for males and the elder (> 65 years). PM 2. 5 had higher risks on all-cause mortality than PM 10. Effects of high PM pollution on mortality were stronger in the elder and male. Conclusions: Our findings provide additional relevant information on air quality monitoring and associations of PM and human health, valuable data for further scientific research in Shenzhen and for the on-going discourse on improving environmental policie...|$|E

Investigations show that the annual average concentrations of SO 2, NO 2, PM 10 are 12 to 64 /m 3, 13 ~ 57 /m 3, 79 ~ 184 /m 3, respectively. As the <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> in the target area, surface NO 2 levels increased by 13 % while PM 10 levels decreased by 39 % from 1996 to 2003. The surface SO 2 concentration showed fluctuations during the study period, reaching a minimum in 1999 and rising again in 2003. Acid rain still remains an important atmospheric environmental issue. The frequency of acid rain was about 23. 5 ~ 36. 7 %, and the pH value of precipitation ranged from 5. 09 to 5. 48, with little change in these years. Modeling studies indicated that sulfur deposition and nitrogen deposition were in the ranges 0. 5 - 10 g/m 2 /yr and 0. 2 - 5 g/m 2 /yr, respectively; these levels exceed the critical load in some regions. The trans-boundary transport of sulfur deposition and nitrogen deposition due to SO 2 and NOx emission among city clusters (Shanghai and the other 8 cities in Jiangsu Province, including Nanjing, Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, Nantong, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Taizhou) in the YRD region was significant.

40|$|Abstract Background Two {{distinctly}} {{different types of}} measurement error are Berkson and classical. Impacts of measurement error in epidemiologic studies of ambient air pollution are expected to depend on error type. We characterize measurement error due to instrument imprecision and spatial variability as multiplicative (i. e. additive on the log scale) and model it over a range of error types to assess impacts on risk ratio estimates both on a per measurement unit basis and on a per interquartile range (IQR) basis in a time-series study in Atlanta. Methods Daily measures of twelve ambient <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> were analyzed: NO 2, NO x, O 3, SO 2, CO, PM 10 mass, PM 2. 5 mass, and PM 2. 5 components sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, elemental carbon and organic carbon. Semivariogram analysis was applied to assess spatial variability. Error due to this spatial variability was added to a reference pollutant time-series on the log scale using Monte Carlo simulations. Each of these time-series was exponentiated and introduced to a Poisson generalized linear model of cardiovascular disease emergency department visits. Results Measurement error resulted in reduced statistical significance for the risk ratio estimates for all amounts (corresponding to different pollutants) and types of error. When modelled as classical-type error, risk ratios were attenuated, particularly for <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants,</b> with average attenuation in risk ratios on a per unit of measurement basis ranging from 18 % to 92 % and on an IQR basis ranging from 18 % to 86 %. When modelled as Berkson-type error, risk ratios per unit of measurement were biased away from the null hypothesis by 2 % to 31 %, whereas risk ratios per IQR were attenuated (i. e. biased toward the null) by 5 % to 34 %. For CO modelled error amount, a range of error types were simulated and effects on risk ratio bias and significance were observed. Conclusions For multiplicative error, both the amount and type of measurement error impact health effect estimates in air pollution epidemiology. By modelling instrument imprecision and spatial variability as different error types, we estimate direction and magnitude {{of the effects of}} error over a range of error types. </p...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} {{efficacy}} of China's actions to control atmospheric pollution, three levels of growth of energy consumption and three levels of implementation of emission controls are estimated, generating a total of nine combined activity-emission control scenarios that are then used to estimate trends of national emissions of <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> through 2030. The emission control strategies {{are expected to have}} more effects than the energy paths on the future emission trends for all the concerned pollutants. As recently promulgated national action plans of air pollution prevention and control (NAPAPPC) are implemented, China's anthropogenic pollutant emissions should decline. For example, the emissions of SO 2, NO x, total suspended particles (TSP), PM 10, and PM 2. 5 are estimated to decline 7, 20, 41, 34, and 31 % from 2010 to 2030, respectively, in the "best guess" scenario that includes national commitment of energy saving policy and implementation of NAPAPPC. Should the issued/proposed emission standards be fully achieved, a less likely scenario, annual emissions would be further reduced, ranging from 17 (for primary PM 2. 5) to 29 % (for NO x) declines in 2015, and the analogue numbers would be 12 and 24 % in 2030. The uncertainties of emission projections result mainly from the uncertain operational conditions of swiftly proliferating <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> control devices and lack of detailed information about emission control plans by region. The predicted emission trends by sector and chemical species raise concerns about current pollution control strategies: the potential for emissions abatement in key sectors may be declining due to the near saturation of emission control devices use; risks of ecosystem acidification could rise because emissions of alkaline base cations may be declining faster than those of SO 2; and radiative forcing could rise because emissions of positive-forcing carbonaceous aerosols may decline more slowly than those of SO 2 emissions and thereby concentrations of negative-forcing sulfate particles. Expanded control of emissions of fine particles and carbonaceous aerosols from small industrial and residential sources is recommended, and a more comprehensive emission control strategy targeting a wider range of pollutants (volatile organic compounds, NH 3 and CO, etc.) and taking account of more diverse environmental impacts is also urgently needed...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Ambient air pollution, {{particularly}} in densely populated urban areas, {{is a major}} risk factor {{for the health of}} the exposed population. The respiratory tract is the <b>primary</b> target for <b>air</b> <b>pollutants.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of long-term exposure to air pollution and incidence of respiratory symptoms and diseases. Material and methods. Measurements of air pollutants: sulphur dioxide and soot particles, were carried out daily at the Institute of Public Health in Niš at two locations, in Niš and in Niška Banja, during the period 1999 - 2003. The Air Quality Index was calculated for both areas. The investigation included 654 women, nonsmokers, between 20 - 30 years of age, from two areas with different levels of common <b>air</b> <b>pollutants.</b> The prevalence of respiratory symptoms and diseases was determined on the basis of a modified WHO standard questionnaire completed by doctors. Results. The obtained results show that examinees from Niš had a statistically higher prevalence of some respiratory symptoms (cough with cold and phlegm) whereas women from Niška Banja had a statistically significantly higher prevalence of lower respiratory tract diseases. Conclusion. Long-term exposure to low concentrations of <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> is a contributing factor to the development of respiratory symptoms and diseases...|$|R
40|$|Air {{pollution}} causes visibility {{reduction in}} urban areas such as Los Angeles {{as well as in}} national parks and wilderness areas. In this work, alternative mathematical models are formulated that relate <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions or ambient <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> concentrations to visual range or to changes in the appearance of a scenic vista. The first model examined connects continuous measurements of airborne particle size distributions to resulting effects on visibility via Mie scattering calculations. The model is tested by application to data taken during the 1987 Southern California Air Quality study. The time series of measured light scattering coefficient values is reproduced well when redundant nephelometer measurements are available to assure that the measured light scattering coefficient values are not in doubt. A source-oriented model for <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> effects on visibility next is assembled that computes light scattering directly from data on gas-phase and <b>primary</b> particle-phase <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions from sources. Airborne particle mass concentrations are predicted accurately. The model predictions generally match the measured aerosol size distribution and chemical composition. Good agreement is attained between model predictions and measurements of atmospheric light scattering coefficient values. An image processing-based visibility model is presented that displays model calculations as synthetic color photographs having the appearance of a smog event. Beginning with a digitized clear day photograph of the scene of interest, a theoretically based model for light scattering and absorption is used to recalculate sky color and skylight addition between the observer and objects in the field of view in order to predict the appearance of the scene in the presence of heavy smog. Model verification data are collected experimentally, including photographs of chosen vistas and measurements of the atmospheric aerosol chemical composition and size distribution. The model performs well, producing representations of the sky color and objects in the field of view that are close to those seen in actual photographs. This model also is adapted to begin with data on landscape features taken from earth-orbiting satellites combined with digital terrain elevation data, such that the model could be applied on a global sca...|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic heat (AH) {{emissions}} from human activities {{can change the}} urban circulation and thereby affect the air pollution in and around cities. Based on statistic data, the spatial distribution of AH flux in South China is estimated. With {{the aid of the}} Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF/Chem), in which the AH parameterization is developed to incorporate the gridded AH emissions with temporal variation, simulations for January and July in 2014 are performed over South China. By analyzing the differences between the simulations with and without adding AH, the impact of AH on regional meteorology and air quality is quantified. The results show that the regional annual mean AH fluxes over South China are only 0. 87  W m − 2, but the values for the urban areas of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region can be close to 60  W m − 2. These AH emissions can significantly change the urban heat island and urban-breeze circulations in big cities. In the PRD city cluster, 2  m air temperature rises by 1. 1 ° in January and over 0. 5 ° in July, the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) increases by 120  m in January and 90  m in July, 10  m wind speed is intensified to over 0. 35  m s − 1 in January and 0. 3  m s − 1 in July, and accumulative precipitation is enhanced by 20 – 40  % in July. These changes in meteorological conditions can significantly impact the spatial and vertical distributions of <b>air</b> <b>pollutants.</b> Due to the increases in PBLH, surface wind speed and upward vertical movement, the concentrations of <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> decrease near the surface and increase in the upper levels. But the vertical changes in O 3 concentrations show the different patterns in different seasons. The surface O 3 concentrations in big cities increase with maximum values of over 2. 5  ppb in January, while O 3 is reduced at the lower layers and increases at the upper layers above some megacities in July. This phenomenon {{can be attributed to the}} fact that chemical effects can play a significant role in O 3 changes over South China in winter, while the vertical movement can be the dominant effect in some big cities in summer. Adding the gridded AH emissions can better describe the heterogeneous impacts of AH on regional meteorology and air quality, suggesting that more studies on AH should be carried out in climate and air quality assessments...|$|R

40|$|The {{regulation}} of the emissions of ‘traditional’ <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> (fluorides, sulfur dioxide) has changed the pattern of exposure of ecological systems, with greatly reduced exposure close to sources, but with a smaller effect in some remote areas. Measurements show that recovery is occurring at some sites, in fresh water chemistry (reduced acidity) and in sensitive biota (sustainable fish populations). However, the pattern of change in exposure {{has not always been}} simply related to emission reductions. An understanding of responses to recent changes will improve our predictions of the response to future emission changes, both locally and globally. As exposure to ‘traditional’ pollutants is reduced, the potential for other pollutants to have effects becomes more evident. In the aqueous phase, we need to understand the role of soluble and suspended organics, but this also means explicit recognition of the possibility of phase exchange, and the role of photolytic reactions on plant, soil, and water surfaces. Do highly reactive free radicals in the atmosphere, formed by the action of sunlight on volatile organic compounds, have direct effects on plants? Organic compounds and heavy metals may be bioactive as gases and particles, but for many potentially toxic compounds, the experimental evidence for biotic response is very limited. To evaluate the potential effects of pollutants, we need to understand the pathways by which airborne pollutants enter and react within ecosystems. For vegetation, we have to consider bidirectional fluxes, and distinguish among uptake through stomata, through leaf surfaces, or through roots. There are several challenges for the future. (1) Can we devise experiments that permit exposure of vegetation to gases, particles, and/or aqueous pollutants at ‘realistic’ concentrations? (2) Can we include the potential interactions with photolytically derived free radicals, and the dynamics of exchange? (3) How do we allow for responses to pollutant mixtures, or the simultaneous exposure to pollutants in gas, particle, and aqueous phases? The recognition {{of the importance of the}} dynamic exchange of pollutants between phases will be the key to the development of effective experimental approaches to evaluating cause–effect relationships between pollutant mixtures and ecosystem responses. ...|$|R

Post-combustion carbon capture (PCC) technology is an innovation technology to capture carbon dioxide (CO 2) from flue gas through solvents absorption typically using monoethanolamine (MEA). PCC technology is a facility installed after the combustion units. In Australia, most power stations are coal-burning power stations. PCC technology {{is more likely to}} be applied on these stations to reduce CO 2 emissions into the atmosphere. However, the technology also emits amine and its degradation products into the atmosphere. Amine can react with OH radicals to form nitrosamine and nitramine under photolysis. A review of literatures in human health impacts reveals that nitrosamine is suspected to be human carcinogenic and aldehydes as the degradation products of amine are known to be toxic. In addition, PCC technology emits ammonia, which is a contributor to fine particle formation. In order to assess potential environmental and human health impacts from the technology, this study hypothesizes a PCC project in Bayswater Power Station in the Upper Hunter region, NSW, Australia and conducts many tasks including an experimental sampling of aldehydes, KPP modelling simulation for amine’s chemical scheme, atmospheric dispersion simulations for amine, nitrosamine, nitramine and other <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants,</b> and risk assessments of formaldehyde and PM 2. 5. In the experimental sampling of aldehydes, the study used an active sampling system to conduct air sampling of aldehydes following TO- 11 A method to determine baseline concentrations of aldehydes on MU campus and in Upper Hunter industrial area. The measured concentration was further used to represent the background value of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in TAPM-CTM setting. The measured average daily HCHO concentration was 2. 2 ppb in late spring, 1. 1 ppb in summer, 1. 3 ppb in late autumn, and 0. 5 ppb in winter on the MU campus. Ambient acetaldehyde concentrations on the MU campus were only available in summer and winter with mean values of 0. 6 ppb and 1. 2 ppb, respectively. In the Upper Hunter area, the HCHO values were measured in summer and winter. The average concentration of ambient HCHO was 1. 0 ppb and 0. 9 ppb in summer and in winter, respectively. The acetaldehyde was only detected in summer with mean value of 1. 8 ppb in the Upper Hunter area. Chemical scheme of amine in the atmosphere was simulated in KPP model under two scenarios: chamber scenario and atmosphere scenario. In the chamber scenario, the MEA decreased sharply in the first 3 hours. Nitramines and nitrosamines increased quickly at the beginning of the experiment, then decreased slightly. In the atmospheric scenario, the concentration changes were slower than the chamber experiment. Atmospheric dispersion of amine and its degradation products were simulated in CALPUFF model. The highest concentrations of amines, nitrosamine, and formaldehyde occurred in December which is the hottest months in southern hemisphere. All values of these compounds did not exceed the US EPA’s recommended threshold level for health impacts. TAPM-CTM model was employed to simulate atmospheric dispersion of <b>primary</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> in the study area using 2003 NSW emission inventory data under different meteorological conditions. The study assumed a 70 % decrease of NOx emissions and a 95 % decrease of SO 2 emission from the Bayswater Power Station. As there is not emission control of NOx and SO 2 in the power station, the decreased NOx and SO 2 emission led to a significant decrease on atmospheric NOx and SO 2 concentrations. Due to the largely decreased NOx and SO 2 emission, the meteorological conditions is likely to play a less significant impacts on the change of near surface concentrations of NOx and SO 2. In addition, the increased aldehyde emissions did not significantly change the concentrations of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. NH 3 is reported to be favored reacting with nitrate acid to form nitrate aerosol (NIT) in low temperatures (Ansari and Pandis, 1998; Heo et al., 2015; Pinder et al., 2008). Due to increased NH 3 from PCC projects, more nitrate aerosol (NIT) may be formed in low temperature under reactions of NH 3 and nitrate acid. The modelled results showed that the average change of NIT were smaller in winter than other months under largely decreased NOx emission. The results indicated nitrate aerosol formation is favored in the low temperature environments. In addition, this study’s results showed the nitrate aerosol formation does not increase linearly with an increase in NH 3. PM 2. 5 formation also did not show a linear relationship with NIT, NH 4 or ASO 4. To assess the health impacts exposure to formaldehyde and PM 2. 5, a Monte-Carlo risk model (@RISK) was employed to simulate lifetime exposure to these <b>air</b> <b>pollutants.</b> The cancer risk due to HCHO exposure decreased slightly after PCC technology installation. The mortality risk due to exposure to PM 2. 5 decreased by 9. 3 × 10 - 6 and 5. 7 × 10 - 6 on mortality from all causes diseases and mortality from lung cancer after installing PCC technology, respectively.
