Amidst the development of radical new binder technologies {{there has been some}} resurgence in interest in Portland-cement’s predecessor – hydraulic lime. This paper describes recent collaborative research, conducted by multidisciplinary engineering consultancy Ramboll and researchers at the BRE Centre for Innovative Construction Materials at the University of Bath, to develop modern, structuralgrade, hydraulic-lime concretes.

As {{the environmental impact}} concerns, {{more than half of}} the by-product can be recycled to be used as construction materials. One of them is pozzolan, a cement replacing material that can be used to enhance the properties of the concrete. This paper studies the chemical attack to local prozzolans concrete. The parameters studied include weight loss, length change, and residual strength of local <b>pozzolans</b> <b>concrete</b> after been exposed to severe environment. The specimen were tested under normal room temperature, exposed to magnesium sulfate, MgSO 4. 2 H 2 O where both sulfate attack and acid attack take place. Two series of pozzolans< which is Pulverized fly ash (PFA) and Palm oil fuel ash (POFA) were identified. Another series of admixture, Quarry Dust (QD) from quarry waste that contain high amount of silica content also been carried out. Each series will study the effect of cement replacement percentage of 5 %, 10 % and 15 %. The parameters were compared to conventional ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete as control mix. Accelerated testing was conducted at 3, 7, 28, 56 and 90 days.

40|$|High Volume <b>Pozzolan</b> <b>Concrete</b> (HVPC) can be {{manufactured}} with low {{carbon dioxide footprint}} and energy consumption {{with the help of}} a new technology based on Energetically Modified Cement (EMC). The technology consists of mechanical processing a blend of ordinary portland cement (PC) and a pozzolan (Class F fly ash) through multiple high intensity grinding mills. The process imparts an increased surface activation of the PC and the pozzolan particles. Fly ash may be processed with all cements forming ready-to-use cement. Alternatively, fly ash can be processed with a small amount of cement (circa 5 % by weight) and used as a pozzolan added to the concrete mixer. The latter product is called CemPozz and has been produced from 2004 by Texas EMC Products, Ltd, at the Limestone plant in Jewett, Texas. It can replace up to 60 % of the PC in concrete. The performance of CemPozz (mechanically processed pozzolan) in concrete is equivalent to Grade 100 blast furnace slag in accordance with ASTM C 989 "Standard Specification for Ground Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag for Use in Concrete and Mortars. "Th e strength of HVPC with 50 % CemPozz is comparable to concrete made of ordinary portland cement, the setting time is similar, with improvements to alkali-silica reactivity mitigation and drying shrinkage. Concretes produced with CemPozz also have much higher sulfate resistance, very low permeability to chloride ions and are characterized by a signifi cantly reduced cracking. Th ere are three environmental benefi ts with the EMC-based HVPC: (i) You can activate a fl y ash that otherwise would not be suitable for high replacement of PC in concrete, (ii) You can reduce the CO 2 footprint by using a much less amount of clinker as concrete binder, and (iii) You can reduce the energy consumption associated with the binder. Calculations show that as much as 45 % can be saved in energy with 45 % less CO 2 emissions when 50 % fl y ash of cement mass is used with the EMC technology. During the period 2004 - 2007, over two million cubic yards (1. 5 million cubic meters) of High Volume <b>Pozzolan</b> <b>Concrete</b> (HVPC) made with CemPozz have been manufactured in Texas and eff ectively used for different applications in Texas (highway paving, housing concrete, shotcrete and blocks).

The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the effect of volcanic ash cements when exposed to different forms of sulfate attack, specifically to sodium and magnesium sulfates. Pozzolanic volcanic ash can be a viable partial substitute for Portland Cements to develop cement paste compositions for superior sulfate resistance with potential for durability and sustainable solutions. Pumiceous volcanic ash was used in preparing Roman hydraulic <b>pozzolan</b> <b>concrete</b> that was used to build the Bay of Naples. This study reports the microstructural and mechanical characterization of cement paste with volcanic ash when exposed to accelerated sulfate attack via electrokinetics. The test specimens were exposed to sodium and magnesium sulfate solutions for a period of 30 days. The effect of gradual decomposition of calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) gel was examined using Raman spectroscopy and Magic Angle Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS NMR), while the mechanical properties were determined using nanoindentation and compression tests. Exposure to magnesium sulfate solution led to formation of magnesium-silicate-hydrate (M-S-H) along with crystallization of gypsum and brucite, while exposure to sodium sulfates led to the formation of thenardite and mirabilite. An optimum mix combination of 10 - 30 % partial substitution of volcanic ash was determined for optimal sulfate resistance and compressive strength. This mix combination was determined by considering the resulting mechanical, micro and pore structure characteristics of the hardened cement pastes. by Maranda Lee Johnston. Thesis: S.

40|$|It is {{an undeniable}} fact that {{concrete}} {{is the most}} widely used man-made construction material in the world today, and will remain so for decades to come. The popularity of concrete is largely due to the abundance of raw material, low manufacturing and maintenance cost, excellence in compression, and corrosion aspects, durability to weathering and fire hazards, versatility in forming various shapes and its unlimited structural applications in combination with steel reinforcement. However, the cement industry is also highly energy intensive, and the emission of carbon dioxide during cement manufacturing has created enormous environmental concerns. There has also been {{an increase in the number}} of incidents where concrete structures experienced severe deterioration in extreme environments. All these factors have contributed pressures from various quarters to reduce cement consumption, and to intensify research in exploring the possibilities of enhancing strength, durability and corrosion reduction through the use of pozzolans as supplementary cementing materials. The utilization of calcined clay in the form of metakaolin as a <b>pozzolan</b> for <b>concrete</b> has received considerable interest in recent years.

40|$|The {{challenge}} for the civil engineering community {{in the near future}} will be to realize the building of structures in harmony with the concept of sustainable development, through the use of high performance materials which have low environmental impact and can be produced at reasonable cost. Geopolymers are novel binder materials that could provide a route towards this objective. Although research on geopolymer has advanced, most of the previous research conducted on geopolymers has dealt with pastes and concentrated on the material's chemistry and microstructure. There is little information available concerning the engineering and durability properties of geopolymer concrete and none considering the use of natural pozzolans for production of geopolymer concrete. This investigation has studied the potential of using five natural pozzolans from Iran as geopolymer precursors. Most of the raw materials contain zeolites and clay minerals and have a high loss on ignition. Therefore, trials were made where samples were calcined at 700, 800 and 900 °C. The solubility of both the raw and calcined materials in an alkaline solution was used as an indicator for pozzolanic activity. Improvements in pozzolanic properties due to heat treatment and elevated curing temperatures (20, 40, 60, and 80 °C) were studied by using alkali solubility, XRD and compressive strength tests. It has been found that geopolymer binders can be synthesized by activating natural pozzolans and condensing them with sodium silicate in a highly alkaline environment. A new model is presented which allows the prediction of the alkali activated pozzolan strength from information on their crystallinity, chemical compositions and alkali solubility. Two types of Iranian natural pozzolans, namely Taftan which can be activated without calcination and Shahindej which was calcined were selected for further activation to study the effect of the alkaline medium on the strength of the alkali-activated natural pozzolan. The effect of the type, form, and concentration (molarities = 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, 10. 0 M) of the alkaline hydroxide, the modulus of sodium silicate (Si 02 INa 20 ratio = 2. 1, 2. 4, 3. 1) and different curing conditions on the geopolymerisation of the above two natural pozzolans were studied. The optimum range and contributions for each factor is suggested based on their effect on compressive strength. An optimum paste formulation has been developed for concrete mixing together with the procedure of addition of the raw materials to the reaction mixture and suitable curing methods for producing the geopolymer concrete derived from them. The properties of this geopolymer concrete in both the fresh and hardened states have been investigated in terms of setting time, workability, air content, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, static modulus of elasticity, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and drying shrinkage. Studies related to durability such as gas permeability, chloride ion penetration, and sulphate resistance have been undertaken and compared to these for typical OPC concretes. Some problems were encountered in applying the standard concrete durability tests. In this study {{attempts have been made to}} determine the relationships between the different properties of geopolymer concrete with its compressive strength and compared to results for ope concrete, to help to explain the differences between alkali-activated natural <b>pozzolan</b> <b>concrete</b> and ope concrete.

These processes, and those of the production of concrete consume heavily on natural resources such as sand, gravel, water, coal and crushed rock, the mining of which mars the environment.

Both tuff and volcanic ash materials were ground and blended with Portland cement at varied replacement levels and tested for several properties. It was found that incorporation of 20 to 25 % volcanic ash gave the highest compressive strength and substantially reduced alkali-silica reac-tivity.

Por ejemplo, hormigones con 33 % de puzolanas en reemplazo del cemento presentaron una resistencia a compresión 27 % inferior a la del hormigón sin puzolanas; sin embargo, su impermeabilidad fue aproximadamente 200 % superior a las de los hormigones sin puzolanas. Los ensayos de permeabilidad a iones cloruro y absorción capilar, presentaron baja variabilidad y buena correlación con las reacciones puzolánicas. Se concluye que se debe controlar independientemente la permeabilidad y la resistencia del hormigón ya que son afectadas de manera diferente por las reacciones puzolánicas; además, se concluye que para considerar el efecto de las puzolanas se debe ensayar permeabilidad a edades tardías.

The experimental program measured compressive strength and permeability of concrete mixtures with different levels of cement replacement by natural pozzolans between 28 and 84 days of age, so the effect of pozzolans could be assessed as a function of time. Results clearly show that the gain in impermeability of concrete due to the use of natural pozzolans is much more pronounced that the effect in compressive strength. For instance, concrete with 33 % of cement replaced by natural pozzolans had a compressive strength 27 % lower that those with no pozzolans replacement; nevertheless, their impermeability was approximately 200 % superior to those with no pozzolans replacement.

The results from each test were evaluated {{to see if there}} was correlation between chloride ion content and the chloride permeability. It was determined that there was a correlation and that the permeability machine was satisfactory for determining chloride permeability in concrete. The second purpose of this study was to examine the effects that pozzolans have on the chloride permeability of concrete. Four mixes were made: one without any pozzolans as a control, one with class C fly ash, one with class F fly ash, and one with silica fume. Specimens from each mix were evaluated for chloride ion content by the 90 -day salt ponding test and by the laboratory built machine for chloride permeability after curing 28 days. Specimens from these mixes were also taken from the salt ponding slabs after completion of the ponding test to examine the effect chloride ion content has on the operation of the chloride permeability machine. Specimens containing pozzolans were also examined for chloride permeability after a cure of 180 days. It was determined that the addition of <b>pozzolans</b> to <b>concrete</b> lowers the chloride permeability as measured by the permeability machine. Class F fly ash and silica fume in the concrete had a major effect in lowering the chloride permeability in concrete as measured by the permeability machine...|$|R

I have selected twelve volunteers (workers who are directly in contact with building materials containing Calcium and Magnesium ions) and prayed them to use three types of shampooing products of my invention (containing special gum resins previously cross-linked in order to uptake or sorption the metallic ions) after having used, in precedence, trivial shampoos (bought at the same store) and used the same tap water, since they live {{all in the same}} town. I calculated the difference of quantities of Magnesium and Calcium that remain onto hair and scalp keratin, using a general and trivial shampoo respect to my products, apt to remove the same metallic ions.

40|$|AbstractEight to 10 {{percent of}} the world's total CO 2 {{emissions}} come from manufacturing cement. The global warming gas is released when limestone and clays are crushed and heated to high temperatures. Green concrete {{is defined as a}} concrete which uses waste material as at least one of its components, or its production process does not lead to environmental destruction, or it has high performance and life cycle sustainability. Various efforts have been conducted by researchers to arrive at some alternatives that are able to significantly reduce high energy consumed and environmental impacts during fabrication process of cement, including implementing the concept of industrial ecology and green chemistry as well as nanoengineering that study the behavior of the structure and organization of nanoparticles of cement in the mix for achieving higher performance. The cleaner technologies in concrete production, such as substituting relatively high percentage of cement by fly ash (up to 100 %), the use of other natural <b>pozzolans,</b> development of <b>concrete</b> with recycling or waste materials, and developing nanoconcrete by integrating CNT's or self sensing CNT's in the concrete mix for higher performance in terms of strength, stiffness, and durability, have been developed and are addressed in this paper. Several efforts that have been done so far in implementing the concept of green concrete and material development of nanosilica in Indonesia is discussed. Finally, problems in the realization of and potential barriers to green concrete as well as political scenarios that have been adopted by several countries through implementation of various priorities and deregulation in various fields are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The use of polymer {{composite}} materials for large body panels in automobiles {{has created an}} environmental problem; these materials are not degradable nor are they recyclable. The objective of this project is to change this kind of material into an admixture to concrete that would enhance {{the properties of the}} concrete, {{and at the same time}} solve an environmental problem. Experimental results show that adding pyrolysed sheet molding compound (PSMC) residue to cement mortar can lead to an increase in the compressive strength of mortar. The improvement in strength is more significant in later ages than in early ages. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction studies reveal that PSMC has changed the microstructure of mortar and interfered with the cement hydration processes. The improvement of strength is believed to be due to both the physical nature and the pozzolanic properties of PSMC. Compared with other <b>pozzolans</b> used in <b>concrete</b> such as fly ash and condensed silica fume, it is concluded that PSMC has similar physical and chemical characteristics, and so there is a strong potential to develop a new pozzolanic admixture for concrete by pyrolysis of sheet molding compound. This may represent an economic solution to the disposal of large polymer automotive panels made from SMC. Dept. of Mechanical, Automotive, and Materials Engineering.

40|$|The {{development}} of improved means of thermal storage is {{an aspect of}} energy conservation which has lagged other advances in this field. The intent of the present work is to address this need. To that end, concrete building materials were selected as ideal candidates for improvement in respect to their thermal storage capability. This was achieved by the incorporation of organic phase change materials (PCM's) in the concrete. These PCM's absorb or release the {{latent heat of fusion}} at a selected temperature and thereby greatly enhance the heat storage capacity of the impregnated concrete over a small temperature range. Modification of the concretes were performed to enhance their compatibility with the PCM's. Four types of aggregate were studied, three of which also found to be suitable for pre-impregnation. The energy storing concretes developed in this research have a very wide range of use in the storage of waste heat, heat from solar collectors of off-peak, low cost heat. In addition, they {{can also be used to}} improve the performance of burners and chillers through reduction of operating frequency by thermal storage. Their application is cost effective in areas with an appropriate diurnal temperature swing and, as fuel costs rise, they may be applied in colder regions as well. Original aspects of energy storage developed in this work comprise: (i) new concrete modules with organic PCM's including fatty esters, fatty alcohols and C 22 -C 24 paraffins; (ii) the application of lightweight aggregates such as pumice, expanded shale and expanded slag as PCM carriers for direct incorporation in concrete; (iii) various techniques for direct incorporation of PCM's without carriers; (iv) the use of <b>pozzolans</b> to modify <b>concrete</b> to permit use of alkali sensitive PCM's; (v) {{development of}} theoretical considerations of PCM diffusion in concrete and the determination of absorption characteristics; (vi) development of technique for defining absorption constants; (vii) the use of PCM's as protective substances in concrete; (viii) development of means to use walls, floors and ceilings for enhanced thermal storage...|$|R
40|$|Mastering {{the risk}} of {{thermally}} induced cracking in concrete structures {{need to know the}} exothermic hydration accompanying binders, particularly in the case of binders containing cement and pozzolan (silica fume or fly ash silico -alumineuse). The works presented here have is to model this exothermic depending on the composition of the concrete, after a bibliographic study and the realization of an experimental plan, including among other many tests Calorimeters supplementing the results find in literature. In a first step, we seek to predict the final magnitude of the exothermic. For this, it was considered, depending on the composition of the concrete {{and the nature of the}} binder, the final quantities of binders capable of reacting in the hydration and the accompanying exothermic hydration of these binders; we also propose a method of calculating the thermal capacity of the concrete depending on its temperature and the progress of hydration. The model proposes a result of this step gives the final elevation of temperature of concrete with a lower average error was 2 c on the sixty concretes tested. Was then studied the heat production kinetics in concrete. It is relatively well deducted from the kinetics of cement hydration, characterized by a standard test cement, and that of the pozzolanic reaction that appeared approximately constant for a given type of pozzolan. Furthermore, the study of the participation of a <b>pozzolan</b> resistance of <b>concrete</b> in compression led to propose an improvement of an existing model which was then valid on a wide set of experimental results taken from literature. This last step was used to compare the modes of participation of pozzolan has heat production on the one hand and the resistance of the other concrete. La maitrise des risques de fissuration d'origine thermique dans les structures en beton necessite de connaitre l'exothermie qui accompagne l'hydratation des liants, en particulier dans le cas de liants contenant du ciment et des pouzzolanes (fumee de silice ou cendre volante silico-alumineuse). Les travaux presentes ici ont consiste a modeliser cette exothermie en fonction de la composition du beton, apres une etude bibliographique et la realisation d'un plan experimental, comportant entre autres de nombreux essais calorimetriques completant les resultats trouves dans la litterature. Dans une premier temps, on a cherche a prevoir l'amplitude finale de l'exothermie. Pour cela, on a estime, en fonction de la composition du beton et de la nature des liants, les quantites finales de liants susceptibles de reagir dans l'hydratation, puis l'exothermie accompagnant l'hydratation de ces liants; on a egalement propose un mode de calcul de la capacite thermique du beton en fonction de sa temperature et de l'avancement de l'hydratation. Le modele propose a l'issue de cette etape donne l'elevation finale de temperature du beton avec une erreur moyenne inferieure a 2 c sur la soixantaine de betons testes. On a ensuite etudie la cinetique de production de chaleur dans le beton. Celle-ci se deduit relativement bien de la cinetique d'hydratation du ciment, caracterisee par un essai standard sur ciment, et de celle de la reaction pouzzolanique qui est apparue a peu pres constante pour un type de pouzzolane donne. Par ailleurs, l'etude de la participation des pouzzolanes a la resistance en compression du beton a conduit a proposer une amelioration d'un modele existant qu'on a ensuite valide sur un large ensemble de resultats experimentaux extraits de la litterature. Cette derniere etape a permis de comparer les modes de participation des pouzzolanes a la production de chaleur d'une part, et a la resistance du beton d'autre part...|$|R
