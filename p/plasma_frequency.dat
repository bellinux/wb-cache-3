There are two requirements to achieve a negative value for refraction. First, is to fabricate a material which can produce negative permeability μeff < 0.

25|$|Furthermore, when wires {{are added}} symmetrically between the split rings, a {{passband}} occurs within the previously forbidden {{band of the}} split ring dispersion curves. That this passband occurs within a previously forbidden region indicates that the negative εeff for this region has combined with the negative μeff to allow propagation, which fits with theoretical predictions. Mathematically, the dispersion relation leads to a band with negative group velocity everywhere, and a bandwidth that is independent of the <b>plasma</b> <b>frequency,</b> within the stated conditions.|$|E

25|$|In megatesla {{magnetic}} fields a quantum mechanical effect may suppress energy transfer from the ions to the electrons.

In a megatesla field, an electron would lose its energy to cyclotron radiation in a few picoseconds if the radiation could escape. However, in a sufficiently dense plasma (ne > 2.5×1030 m−3, a density {{greater than that of}} a solid), the cyclotron frequency is less than twice the <b>plasma</b> <b>frequency.</b> In this well-known case, the cyclotron radiation is trapped inside the plasmoid and cannot escape, except from a very thin surface layer.|$|E
25|$|The surface plasmon {{polariton}} (SPP) is an electromagnetic {{surface wave}} that travels along an interface between two media with different dielectric constants. It exists under {{the condition that}} the permittivity of one of the materials forming the interface is negative, while the other one is positive, as is the case for the interface between air and a lossy conducting medium below the <b>plasma</b> <b>frequency.</b> The wave propagates parallel to the interface and decays exponentially vertical to it, a property called evanescence. Since the wave is on the boundary of a lossy conductor and a second medium, these oscillations can be sensitive to changes to the boundary, such as the adsorption of molecules by the conducting surface.|$|E

It exists under the condition that the permittivity of one of the materials forming the interface is negative, while the other one is positive, as for example the interface between air and a lossy conducting medium such as the terrestrial transmission line, below the <b>plasma</b> <b>frequency.</b> Arising from original analysis by Arnold Sommerfeld and Jonathan Zenneck of the problem of wave propagation over a lossy earth, it exists as an exact solution to Maxwell's equations.|$|E

In addition, we study the effective permittivities and permeabilities of labyrinth based metamaterials. Our results show that the effective permeability of the labyrinth based metamaterial medium is negative above a certain frequency. The results of the effective permittivity calculations for the labyrinth based metamaterial medium reveal that the labyrinth structure exhibits a strong dielectric response near the magnetic resonance frequency.

Ferromagnetic CdCr 2 S 4 and antiferromagnetic HgCr 2 S 4 behave rather similar. Both compounds are dominated by ferromagnetic exchange and although HgCr 2 S 4 is an antiferromagnet, no phonon splitting can be observed at the magnetic phase transition.

In particular, at extremely large frequencies (above the <b>plasma</b> <b>frequency),</b> metals become transparent to photons (such as X-rays), and dielectrics show a frequency-dependent cutoff as well. This frequency dependence acts as a natural regulator.

In any case, a natural material that can achieve negative values for permittivity and permeability simultaneously has not been found or discovered. Hence, all of this has led to constructing artificial composite materials known as metamaterials in order to achieve the desired results.|$|E
