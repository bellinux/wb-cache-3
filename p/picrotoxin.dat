The GABAergic {{system may}} be involved in schizophrenia due to its interactions with the dopaminergic system. <b>Picrotoxin,</b> an antagonist for the GABAA receptor, produces prepulse inhibition of startle in rats.

2500|$|Gilles Laurent {{and colleagues}} showed that oscillatory {{synchronization}} {{has an important}} functional role in odor perception. Perceiving different odors leads to different subsets of neurons firing on different sets of oscillatory cycles. [...] These oscillations can be disrupted by GABA blocker <b>picrotoxin,</b> and the disruption of the oscillatory synchronization leads to impairment of behavioral discrimination of chemically similar odorants in bees and to more similar responses across odors in downstream β-lobe neurons. Recent follow-up of this work has shown that oscillations create periodic integration windows for Kenyon cells in the insect mushroom body, such that incoming spikes from the antennal lobe are more effective in activating Kenyon cells only at specific phases of the oscillatory cycle.|$|E
2500|$|GABAA and GABAC {{receptor}}s {{are known}} to be ionotropic, while the GABAB receptor is metabotropic. GABAA receptors mediate fast inhibitory responses in the central nervous system (CNS) and are found on neurons, glial cells, and adrenal medulla cells. It is responsible for inducing Cl− ion influx into cells, thereby reducing the probability that membrane depolarization will occur upon the arrival of a graded potential or an action potential. GABA receptors can also interact with non-endogenous ligands to influence activity. For example, the compound diazepam (marketed as Valium) is an allosteric agonist which increases the affinity of the receptor for GABA. The increased physiological inhibitory effects resulting from increased GABA binding make diazepam a useful tranquilizer or anticonvulsant (antiepileptic drugs). On the other hand, GABA receptors can also be targeted by decreasing Cl− cellular influx with the effect of convulsants like <b>picrotoxin.</b> The antagonistic mechanism of action for this compound is not directly on the GABA receptor, but there are other compounds that are capable of allosteric inactivation, including T-butylbicyclophorothionate (TBPS) and pentylenetetrazole (PZT).|$|E
50|$|<b>Picrotoxin</b> {{has also}} {{been used as a}} {{starting}} material in several synthetic processes, including the creation of dl-picrotoxadiene, which retains certain features of the <b>picrotoxin</b> skeleton.|$|E
5000|$|Currently, {{not much}} {{information}} exists regarding the lab synthesis of <b>picrotoxin.</b> Some {{research suggests that}} it can be made by the cyclofunctionalization of cycloalkenyl systems. Under kinetically controlled conditions, this process generally results in exo cyclization and forms bridged ring systems like those found in <b>picrotoxin.</b> Additionally, several syntheses have been proposed for picrotoxinin and picrotin, the two molecules that make up <b>picrotoxin.</b> In 1980, a process to convert picrotoxinin to picrotin was discovered. This synthesis beings by treating <b>picrotoxin</b> with trifluoroacetic anhydride in pyridine to separate the components.|$|E
50|$|Other {{research}} suggests that the toxin acts instead as a non-competitive antagonist, or inhibitor, for GABA receptors. A study by Newland and Cull-Candy found that, in high enough concentrations, <b>picrotoxin</b> reduced the amplitude of GABA currents. Their data indicated that it was unlikely that <b>picrotoxin</b> acted simply as a voltage-gated channel blocker, although it did reduce the frequency of channel openings. Rather, they found that <b>picrotoxin</b> “binds preferentially to an agonist bound form of the receptor.” This means that, even in the presence of low concentrations of <b>picrotoxin,</b> the response of neurons to GABA is reduced.|$|E

50|$|As an {{extension}} of his work on barbiturate therapy, Bleckwenn and Mabel Masten also studied the reversal of overdosage by amobarbital in the mid-1930s. They found that dilute intravenous solutions of <b>picrotoxin</b> (cocculin)-- a neurostimulatory plant product—were effective as an antidote in that setting. However, over time, the narrow therapeutic window associated with <b>picrotoxin</b> administration—which can also induce seizures—resulted in its disuse.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Picrotoxin</b> acts as {{a central}} nervous system and {{respiratory}} stimulant. It is extremely toxic to fish and humans, as well as rodents and other mammals. According to the Register of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances, the LDLo, or lowest reported lethal dose, is 0.357 mg/kg. Symptoms of <b>picrotoxin</b> poisoning include coughing, difficulty breathing, headache, dizziness, confusion, gastro-intestinal distress, nausea or vomiting, and changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Although especially dangerous if swallowed, systemic effects can also result from inhalation or absorption into the blood stream through lesions in the skin. [...] <b>Picrotoxin</b> also {{acts as a}} convulsant. In larger doses, {{it has been found}} to induce clonic seizures or cardiac dysrhythmias, with especially high doses ultimately proving fatal, typically due to respiratory paralysis.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Picrotoxin,</b> {{also known}} as cocculin, is a {{poisonous}} crystalline plant compound. It was first isolated by the French pharmacist and chemist Pierre François Guillaume Boullay (1777-1869) in 1812. The name [...] "picrotoxin" [...] {{is a combination of}} the Greek words [...] "picros" [...] (bitter) and [...] "toxicon" [...] (poison). A mixture of two different compounds, <b>picrotoxin</b> occurs naturally in the fruit of the Anamirta cocculus plant, although it can also be synthesized chemically.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Picrotoxin</b> is an equimolar {{mixture of}} two compounds, picrotoxinin (C15H16O6; CAS# 17617-45-7) and picrotin (C15H18O7; CAS# 21416-53-5). [...] Of the two compounds, picrotin is less active.|$|E
50|$|Two {{different}} but related theories {{have been proposed}} for the mechanism by which <b>picrotoxin</b> acts on the body. One theory is that it acts as a non-competitive channel blocker for GABAA receptor chloride channels, specifically the gamma-aminobutyric acid-activated chloride ionophore. A 2006 study found that, while not structurally similar to GABA, <b>picrotoxin</b> prevents ion flow through the chloride channels activated by GABA. It likely acts within the ion channels themselves, rather than at GABA recognition sites. Because it inhibits channels activated by GABA, GABA-enhancing drugs like barbiturates and benzodiazepines {{can be used as}} an antidote.|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{interactions}} with the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, <b>picrotoxin</b> acts as a stimulant and convulsant. It mainly impacts the central nervous system, causing seizures and respiratory paralysis in high enough doses.|$|E

50|$|<b>Picrotoxin</b> occurs {{naturally}} in {{the fruit of}} the Anamirta cocculus, a climbing plant from India and other parts of Southeast Asia. The plant is known for its large stems of white wood and sweetly-scented flowers. It produces small stone fruits, Cocculus indicus, which are typically dried.|$|E
50|$|Due to its toxicity, <b>picrotoxin</b> is {{now most}} {{commonly}} used as a research tool. However, due to its antagonist effect on GABA receptors, {{it has been used}} as a central nervous system stimulant. It was also previously used as an antidote for poisoning by CNS depressants, especially barbiturates.|$|E
50|$|Convulsant drugs (the {{functional}} opposites of anticonvulsants) {{will always}} induce seizures at sufficient doses. Examples of such agents, {{some of which}} are used or have been used clinically for various purposes, and others of which are naturally occurring toxins, include strychnine, bemegride, flumazenil, cyclothiazide, flurothyl, pentylenetetrazol, bicuculline, cicutoxin, and <b>picrotoxin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dioscorine is {{reported}} {{to be one of the}} most potent alkaloid toxins isolated from yam. It has an LD50 of 60 mg/kg in mice through an intraperitoneal route of administration.When injected into monkeys, it has a mydriatic action (that is, it causes the pupils to dilate), and resembles the pharmacological action of <b>picrotoxin</b> and cardiac glycosides.|$|E
50|$|The {{active site}} of the GABAA {{receptor}} is the binding site for GABA and several drugs such as muscimol, gaboxadol, and bicuculline.

50|$|The coma {{cocktail}} {{is thought}} to have been created in United States as a first line treatment for an unconscious patient in an era where intensive care was new and difficult to maintain. Original coma cocktails included methylxanthines, physostigmine, physical stimulation (such as cold water baths or ammonium carbonate ("smelling salts")), amphetamines, strychnine, <b>picrotoxin,</b> nikethamide and camphor. As medicine and assessment techniques have advanced, the proceeding drugs have been mostly replaced by the modern coma cocktail as described above.|$|E
50|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that the fast response of neurons to GABA that is blocked by bicuculline and <b>picrotoxin</b> is due to direct activation of an anion channel. This channel was subsequently termed the GABAA receptor. Fast-responding GABA receptors {{are members of a}} family of Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels. Members of this superfamily, which includes nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, GABAA receptors, glycine and 5-HT3 receptors, possess a characteristic loop formed by a disulfide bond between two cysteine residues.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of pentylenetetrazol {{is not well}} understood, {{and it may have}} multiple mechanisms of action. In 1984, Squires et al. published a report analyzing pentylenetetrazol and several structurally related convulsant drugs. They found that in vivo convulsant potency was strongly correlated to in vitro affinity to the <b>picrotoxin</b> binding site on the GABA-A receptor complex. Many GABA-A ligands are effective anticonvulsants, such as the sedatives diazepam and phenobarbital, but presumably pentylenetetrazol has the opposite effect when it binds to the GABA-A receptor.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} widely used {{analeptics}} was strychnine, which causes CNS excitation by antagonizing the inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine. Strychnine is subcategorized as a convulsant along with <b>picrotoxin</b> and bicuculline, though these convulsants inhibit GABA receptors instead of glycine. Strychnine was used until the early 20th century, when it {{was found to be}} a highly toxic convulsant. Strychnine is now available as a rodenticide as well as an adulterant in drugs such as heroin. The other two convulsants antagonize GABA receptors, but neither are commonly accessible today.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the newer}} anticonvulsants, {{retigabine}} {{was one of}} the most widely studied in the preclinical setting: it was the subject of over 100 published studies before clinical trials began. In preclinical tests, it was found to have a very broad spectrum of activity—being effective in nearly all the animal models of seizures and epilepsy used: retigabine suppresses seizures induced by electroshock, electrical kindling of the amygdala, pentylenetetrazol, kainate, NMDA, and <b>picrotoxin.</b> Researchers hoped this wide-ranging activity would translate to studies in humans as well.|$|E
5000|$|Despite its {{potential}} toxicity to mammals in large enough doses, <b>picrotoxin</b> is also sometimes {{used as a}} performance enhancer in horses. It is classified as an illegal [...] "Class I substance" [...] by the American Quarter Horse Association. Substances that are classified as “Class I” are likely to affect performance and have no therapeutic use in equine medicine. In 2010, quarter horse trainer Robert Dimitt was suspended after his horse, Stoli Signature, {{tested positive for the}} substance. As with humans, it is used to counteract barbiturate poisoning.|$|E
50|$|This {{gene product}} {{belongs to the}} family of {{candidate}} taste receptors that are members of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. These proteins are specifically expressed in the taste receptor cells of the tongue and palate epithelia. They are organized in the genome in clusters and are genetically linked to loci that influence bitter perception in mice and humans. In functional expression studies, TAS2R14 responds to (−)-α-thujone, the primary neurotoxic agent in absinthe, and <b>picrotoxin,</b> a poison found in fishberries. This gene maps to the taste receptor gene cluster on chromosome 12p13.|$|E
