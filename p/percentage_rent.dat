The analysis breaks new ground by treating base and <b>percentage</b> <b>rents</b> as endogenous functions of retail sales.

Simulation results suggest that shopping center rents can easily increase in the short-run as retail sales decrease, or they can easily decrease as retail sales increase.

50|$|Where council tenant rents {{are high}} in {{comparison}} to guidelines issued by the Department of Communities and Local Government, the restriction applies the subsidy payable to local authorities and not the individual claimant. This is done through the Rent Rebate Subsidy Limitation <b>Percentage.</b> <b>Rent</b> Rebate is normally paid at a subsidy rate of 100%. Where rents are high the amount payable by the DWP is the percentage derived from dividing the average rent for the authority by the target rent figure. The cost of this is then met by Housing Revenue Account (the total borough funds for council tenants).|$|E
50|$|The third {{determinant}} of value is the lease itself. As mentioned previously NNN leases are {{more valuable than}} NN leases because the landlord is responsible {{for some of the}} expenses in a double net lease. The length of the lease is also a {{determinant of}} value (20 years of guaranteed income will be worth more than say 10 or 15 year terms). Generous rental increases, also known as rent bumps, add value to the lease and protect the landlord against inflation. Some leases also have a <b>percentage</b> <b>rent</b> kick in if their gross sales hits a certain CAP. Most leases grant the tenant options to renew (several short term options put the landlord in a weaker position {{when it comes time to}} re-new the lease). Are the current rents called for in the lease below market? If they are the landlord has the opportunity to command higher rents when the lease term is up.|$|E

The findings show that the tradeoff between the security deposit and base rent provisions is independent of <b>percentage</b> <b>rent.</b> The function of the security deposit and <b>percentage</b> <b>rent</b> is to sort separate tails {{of the distribution of}} tenants and landlords. Low-quality tenants are charged higher security deposits or are sorted from other tenants by their inability to pay them.

40|$|Given {{the current}} {{financial}} crisis, we explore {{the impact that}} tenant bankruptcies have on the risk and return performance of their publicly traded landlord.

Utilizing an event study approach, we find significant abnormal negative returns follow the bankruptcy of a tenant in general which is consistent with the market perceiving that tenants will take advantage of the co-tenancy option. However, we also find that there are some situations where the growth option is in the money and thus abnormal returns are positive particularly in markets that have a more diversified economic base...|$|R
40|$|Only retail tenants {{pay their}} {{landlord}} {{a percentage of}} revenue {{in addition to the}} traditional fixed rent. The latter has often been shown to vary widely across stores- inverse to the sales externalities generated by the store. This paper demonstrates that revenue percentages vary widely as well, and positively with fixed rent (sales externalities). It is then argued that existing theoretical explanations for <b>percentage</b> <b>rent</b> (involving generic risk sharing and tenant effort issues) are not specific to the retail sector and apply to all tenant-landlord relationships. Instead, a model is proposed where <b>percentage</b> <b>rent</b> gives the correct incentive to landlords- rather than the reverse. In this model, <b>percentage</b> <b>rent</b> insures that with sales externalities, landlords do not act opportunistically and always have the interest of existing tenants in mind when expanding, altering or reletting space in a shopping center. 1 I...|$|E
40|$|The {{determinants}} of lease rentals are of fundamental importance {{to real estate}} researchers and practitioners. Retail leases are unique in that they typically have two rental components: a base rent and an "overage" rent equal to {{a percentage of the}} tenant's gross sales above some threshold level. In this paper, we develop and test a simple cash flow model of retail lease valuation that predicts that base rents are lower with higher <b>percentage</b> <b>rent</b> rates and are higher with greater threshold levels of sales.

40|$|In this paper, we {{formulate}} a tenant management problem for retail properties, such as shopping centers, provide an analytical framework for deriving the probability {{distribution of the}} sum of discounted future cash flows stochastically generated through tenant management, and find an optimal lease agreement structure and strategy for tenant-replacement management. More specifically, we formulate the problem of valuing the net present value of future net income from a retail property with tenant management and provide a valuation model for management decision making. The income fluctuates with market rent variations and management processes. In our framework, a property manager is required to choose an optimal mix of fixed rent and variable rent linked to tenant sales, and one of two tenant-replacement rules for return and risk enhancement.

The answer to this question can enhance our understanding of residential mobility and of the mechanisms causing segregation by income and ethnic groups.

Whether or not people wish to leave their neighbourhood is estimated using a multilevel logistic regression model with cross-level interaction effects between individual and neighbourhood characteristics.

40|$|Until {{the end of}} 1977, {{the method}} used to measure changes in rent of primary {{residence}} in the U. S. consumer price index (CPI) tended to omit price changes when units changed tenants or were temporarily vacant. Since such units typically had more rapid increases in rents than average units, omitting them biased inflation estimates downward. Beginning in 1978, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) implemented a series of methodological changes that reduced this bias. The authors use data from the American Housing Survey to check {{the success of the}} corrections. They compare estimates of the historical series adjusted for the BLS changes in methodology with a new hedonic estimate of changes in rental rates. The authors conclude that from 1940 to 1977 the CPI for rent would have been about 60 percent higher if current BLS practices had been used – between 1. 3 and 3. 5 percentage points. Even after the corrections have been made, the authors' hedonic estimates suggest that the current CPI methodology may still understate the rental inflation rate by one-half to 1 <b>percentage</b> point. <b>Rent...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between burglary and socio-demographic factors {{has long been}} a hot topic in crime research. Spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity are two issues to be addressed in modeling geographic data. When these two issues arise at the same time, it is difficult to model them simultaneously. A cross-comparison of three models is presented in this study to identify which spatial effect should be addressed first in crime analysis. The negative binominal model (NB), Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) and the geographically weighted Poisson regression model (GWPR) were implemented based on a three-year residential burglary data set from ZG, China. The modeling result shows that both BHM and GWPR outperform NB as they capture either of the spatial effects. Compared to the NB model, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of BHM and GWPR was decreased by 83. 71 % and 49. 39 %, the mean squared error (MSE) of BHM and GWPR was decreased by 97. 88 % and 77. 15 %, and the R d 2 of BHM and GWPR was improved by 26. 7 % and 19. 1 %, respectively. In comparison with BHM and GWPR, BHM fits the data better with lower MAD, MSE and higher R d 2. The empirical analysis indicates that the <b>percentage</b> of <b>renter</b> population, <b>percentage</b> of people from other provinces, bus line density, and bus stop density have a significantly positive impact on the number of residential burglaries.
