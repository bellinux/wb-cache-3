50|$|The {{operation}} for both barrels {{is housed in}} a single receiver. This is a single forging, milled to house the two separate actions. The magazine opening is {{cut out of the}} top of the receiver, the ejection slot out of the bottom. Each action has its own back plate. The gas <b>piston</b> <b>group</b> action is based on ZB vz. 26 design. The bolt is a steel forging well machined. The gas cylinder tube is constructed of seamless steel tubing and is threaded to the receiver at the rear. The trigger assembly is made up of two separate sear assemblies riveted to the pistol grip framework. Two pistol grips are located about 6 inches apart, the sears are connected to a horizontal trigger bar mounting a trigger on either end. Both guns may be fired by depressing either trigger. The magazine is the saddle-drum magazine type. Each side holds 50 rounds and feeds one gun. Each side has its own spring so that, {{in the event of a}} jam affecting one barrel, the other gun may continue to fire.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine unit}} {{for the new}} car was already present and a test batch of ZMZ-406 {{equipped}} GAZ-31029s was available since 1996. Sharing the 402's <b>piston</b> <b>group,</b> the motor was to {{all intents and purposes}} completely new, despite undergoing a lengthy research and design period. The motor's brief was drawn in 1982, and finalised only in 1986, to be used on the new 3103 and 3104 models. A contemporary twin overhead camshaft (DOHC)—four valve per cylinder scheme was chosen with Bosch fuel-injected intake. The high inertia of the piston stroke limited potential forced induction, and was thus reduced from 92 to 86, hence a volume decline of 2445 cc to 2286 cc. Compression on the naturally aspirated 406 was now 9.3 instead of 8.5 of the 402, and the redline grew to 5500 RPM (4750 on the 402). A two-step timing chain was implemented for reliability, and a cast iron cylinder block to give it necessary strength when used on future modifications with forced induction and/or diesels. The 406 engine was mated to the five-speed gearbox. Front disk brakes and power steering was now standard.|$|E

50|$|With {{two-cylinder}} compounds used in railway work, the pistons {{are connected}} to the cranks as with a two-cylinder simple at 90° out of phase with each other (quartered). When the double-expansion group is duplicated, producing a four-cylinder compound, the individual <b>pistons</b> within the <b>group</b> are usually balanced at 180°, the groups being set at 90° to each other.

With the three-cylinder compound arrangement, the LP cranks were either set at 90° with the HP one at 135° to the other two, or in some cases all three cranks were set at 120°.|$|R

40|$|A {{growing number}} of studies {{conducted}} on stapes surgery have suggested that firm and adequate attachment of the prosthesis onto the long process of the incus {{plays a key role}} in surgical success. For this reason, a new prosthesis made of Nitinol characterized by “self-crimping” has been developed. Although better postoperative outcomes achieved with a Nitinol piston have been previously confirmed, the superiority of the Nitinol piston over the conventional manual-crimping prostheses remains controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the advantages of the Nitinol piston with regard to hearing improvement. Methods: We retrospectively compared postoperative hearing in otosclerosis surgeries with the Nitinol piston versus the manual-crimping prostheses. Sixteen surgeries with Nitinol pistons (carried out between April 2007 and August 2009) and 21 surgeries with conventional prostheses (carried out between January 2004 and January 2009) were evaluated. All patients received pure-tone audiograms preoperatively and postoperatively. Results: In the Nitinol <b>piston</b> <b>group,</b> the air-bone gap (ABG) average (7. 92 ± 6. 75 dBHL) was significantly smaller postoperatively than preoperatively (26. 79 ± 8. 33 dBHL, p < 0. 001). Similarly, the ABG average for the conventional <b>piston</b> <b>group</b> (13. 09 ± 6. 99 dBHL) was significantly smaller postoperatively than preoperatively (26. 19 ± 6. 76 dBHL, p < 0. 001). Although both groups demonstrated an improvement in average ABG postoperatively, the Nitinol <b>piston</b> <b>group</b> showed a greater improvement than the conventional <b>piston</b> <b>group</b> (p = 0. 018). Additionally, ABG closure within 10 dB was attained in significantly more patients (75 %) in the Nitinol <b>piston</b> <b>group</b> compared with the conventional <b>piston</b> <b>group</b> (33. 3 %, p = 0. 012). Conclusion: The Nitinol piston has a distinct advantage over conventional prostheses, providing an easier, safer and more effective treatment option in otosclerosis surgery. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative analysis of hearing results of the Nitinol piston with conventional prostheses in the Chinese population in Taiwan. In this population, there is a much lower prevalence of otosclerosis, leading to a lack of surgical experience in otosclerosis surgery, even at large medical centers. This may explain, in part, the relative lack of studies conducted on stapes prostheses in Asian patients. Therefore, our preliminary research may provide a reference for future investigations on stapes surgery in Asian patients with otosclerosis based on ethnic differences...|$|E

40|$|Aims and Objectives: This {{prospective}} {{randomized controlled}} trial {{was done to}} study the effect of piston diameter on hearing outcomes after stapedotomy. Materials and Methods: All the patients diagnosed to have otosclerosis {{were included in the}} study. A total of 52 patients were studied ranging in age from 18 to 50 years. The subjects were randomized into two groups, that is, 0. 4 mm <b>piston</b> (<b>group</b> A) and 0. 6 mm <b>piston</b> (<b>group</b> B). The subjects were taken up for small fenestra stapedotomy using either a 0. 4 or 0. 6 mm piston. The main outcome measures were hearing improvement, air-bone gap closure, and overclosure of air-bone gap. Results: There was no statistical difference in hearing improvement in two different piston diameters, 0. 4 and 0. 6 mm at speech frequencies. In group A, the air-bone gap improvement in the third follow-up was not significant (P > 0. 05), whereas group B showed a statistically significant improvement (P = 0. 003). The mean overclosure of air-bone gap was better in patients with 0. 4 mm piston at speech frequencies and also at 250 Hz. Significantly, overclosure of air-bone gap at higher frequencies (4 and 8 KHz) was seen only with a smaller sized piston. (0. 4 mm). Discussion: We analyzed the effect of piston diameter on the hearing results after small fenestra stapedotomy by using similar surgical procedure and similar prosthesis in all patients.

40|$|Abstract. One new sliding-block {{balancing}} mechanism is {{proposed for the}} single-cylinder diesel engine. In the new mechanism, the sliding block is installed against the engine piston. The reciprocation trajectory of sliding block is collinear with the piston trajectory, while sliding block and piston move in the opposite direction, just like two opposite crank connecting rods. The new mechanism includes the crankshaft, connecting rod ring, the slider and the guide components. Through the bearing, connecting rod is installed in the eccentric journal of the crankshaft. The circular connecting rod is in the accurate guiding surface of the slider; and the guide pins are in the guide groove. Guide rod connects with supporting shaft through the guide hole of the slide. The optimized parameters for the sliding block show that the ratio of eccentric distance of the eccentric journal {{to the length of}} the connecting rod is equal to the ratio of crank radius to connecting rod length. The appropriate results can balance both the centrifugal inertia force and the reciprocating inertia force generated by <b>piston</b> <b>group.</b> Even the complete balance of the first and second-order reciprocating inertia forces can be obtained, which can reduce the vibration and noise of diesel engine...|$|E
40|$|Vision {{of human}} actions can affect several {{features}} of visual motion processing, {{as well as}} the motor responses of the observer. Here, we tested the hypothesis that action observation helps decoding environmental forces during the interception of a decelerating target within a brief time window, a task intrinsically very difficult. We employed a factorial design to evaluate the effects of scene orientation (normal or inverted) and target gravity (normal or inverted). Button-press triggered the motion of a bullet, a piston, or a human arm. We found that the timing errors were smaller for upright scenes irrespective of gravity direction in the Bullet group, while the errors were smaller for the standard condition of normal scene and gravity in the <b>Piston</b> <b>group.</b> In the Arm group, instead, performance was better when the directions of scene and target gravity were concordant, irrespective of whether both were upright or inverted. These results suggest that the default viewer-centered reference frame is used with inanimate scenes, such as those of the Bullet and Piston protocols. Instead, the presence of biological movements in animate scenes (as in the Arm protocol) may help processing target kinematics under the ecological conditions of coherence between scene and target gravity directions...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To present our mid-term {{results of}} our multicenter study using the Nitinol self-crimping stapes piston, {{focusing}} on the interindividual variations of postoperative air-bone gap closures (ABGC), postoperative hearing results, and postoperative recurrences of conductive hearing loss and to compare these findings with our pilot group of patients. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter cohort study involving three academic tertiary care referral centers from Australia, Switzerland, and the United States. METHODS: Ninety patients with otosclerosis undergoing laser-stapedotomy with the Nitinol stapes piston were matched to reference patients from our titanium piston database. The effects of the self-crimping Nitinol piston on the postoperative ABGC, the postoperative interindividual air-bone gap (ABG) variations, and the postoperative hearing results were investigated 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively. These data were statistically compared {{with the results of}} the control patients in our titanium stapes piston database and the {{results of our}} previously published pilot study. RESULTS: The mean postoperative ABG and the interindividual variations of the postoperative ABG continue to be significantly smaller in the Nitinol group; the extent of ABGC now is significantly larger in the Nitinol <b>piston</b> <b>group.</b> The postoperative mid-term stability of ABGC was similar in both groups.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of experimental studies of pressure fluctuations in the pipes of piston pumps. The relevance of these studies is due to the need to reduce the pressure fluctuations that create a positive displacement pumps, due to their negative impact not only on the reliability of the pump, but the accuracy of flow measurement and pressure of the medium supplied to such pumps. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the hydraulic characteristics of pulsating flows in pressure lines piston pumps of liquefied gas, as well as the study of the effectiveness of the dampers of pressure pulsations and conformity of their parameters to the calculation. Materials and Methods: As a drive used the piston pumps − single-line and trilinear. In the tests recorded pressure fluctuations in the pressure line. For this purpose the low-inertia pressure sensors 15. 0 MPa working complete with strain test station, which allows registering the pressure fluctuations at frequencies up to 10 kHz.
