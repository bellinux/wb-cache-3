He described this as [...] "des mélodies de telle longeur qu'un seul exposé suffisait à <b>parfaire</b> ... un morceau de musique"("melodies of such length that a single presentation was sufficient to complete ... a piece of music").|$|E
5000|$|Solaar's career {{continued}} to evolve throughout the late nineties {{and into the}} new millennium. He released Cinquième As in 2001 to critical acclaim and Mach 6 in 2003. In the album's third track, [...] "Lève-Toi et Rap", Solaar describes his parents' Chadian emigration {{as well as his}} own roots growing up in Villeneuve-Saint-Georges and Cairo. Towards the beginning of the song he says: Puis trip en Egypte, Ecole Française du Caire/ Pour <b>parfaire</b> mon flow et mon vocabulaire/ Là j'ai appris l'humilité, la peur des cartouches/ Pur style de sniper camouflage paw-mouche, which, translated, roughly means he spent time at a French school in Cairo, perfecting his rapping style and learning how to survive a dangerous lifestyle. Critic Dan Gennoe attests to Solaar's [...] "flow et vocabulaire" [...] by noting [...] "the flow of his words is staggering, as are the low-slung grooves that they roll to; deftly vaulting all language barriers." ...|$|E

Having put forth this observation and made this reservation, the author enters into a description of rituals belonging to an archaic culture which, acting {{in a context of}} the ancestral dead, accomplishes these rituals and thinks in terms of them. First, the author examines the categories of the empirical word and action (speaking, proclaiming, acting, causing) in contrast to the single category of the ritual Word and Act. He then proposes a reading of propitiary and expiatory rites which concludes with a presentation of the forces implicit in these processes. The article ends with a study of the symbolic necessity of the notions contained in the relations between the sexes and the rapport with the dead: impure, not impure, sacred. Guidieri Remo.
