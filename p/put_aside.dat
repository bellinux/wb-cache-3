5|$|Coinage of eagles {{followed}} {{shortly after}} production of half eagles began, although the exact date is uncertain. The first group produced {{is believed to}} have been struck in August and September 1795; 1,097 eagles were made available for circulation on September 22. Four hundred of these were immediately paid out to the Bank of Pennsylvania, which had deposited gold at the Mint for striking into eagles. One piece was <b>put</b> <b>aside</b> for the Mint's coin collection by Eckfeldt.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} series, Carlos <b>put</b> <b>aside</b> his roving ways {{and became the}} {{dominant}} male of the Starsky, with both Kinkajou and Mozart pregnant with his pups. Carlos was bitten in the face during a fight with Commandoes dominant male, Hannibal. An infection set into the wound, eventually killing Carlos (he really died of TB) and leaving the Starsky without a dominant male.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} single-car trains were {{delivered}} in 1959 {{and given the}} designation T. They were delivered by Strømmens Værksted and NEBB as prototypes, without compensation from the planning office. They were tested on the Østensjø and Lambertseter Lines until 1 December 1960, when they were transferred to Bærumsbanen, who used them on the Kolsås Line. During their service they were prone to technical problems, and were more in the depot than in service. However, they gave valuable knowledge for the serial production. The trains were originally painted silver with a dark-blue cheatline and numbered 1 and 2. About 1970, they were repainted dark blue with a silver cheatline, and in 1971 given the numbers 451 and 452. The latter remained in service until 1977, when it was <b>put</b> <b>aside,</b> and scrapped in 1987. The former remained in service until it was <b>put</b> <b>aside</b> as defect, although it had rarely been used since 1982. It was fixed up and made operational again 1993, but was withdrawn the same year and scrapped the following year.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{married his}} second wife, Ælfflæd, {{at about the}} time of his father's death, {{probably}} because Ecgwynn had died, although she may have been <b>put</b> <b>aside.</b> The new marriage weakened Æthelstan's position, as his step-mother naturally favoured the interests of her own sons, Ælfweard and Edwin. By 920 Edward had taken a third wife, Eadgifu, probably after putting Ælfflæd aside. Eadgifu also had two sons, the future kings Edmund and Eadred. Edward had several daughters, perhaps as many as nine.|$|E
5|$|Four units (619, 633, 641 and 643) {{were sold}} to the United Nations and was put into service in Kosovo, in what has since become the Kosovo Railways. Four units (622, 626, 630 and 631) {{were sold to}} an {{operator}} in Sicily, Italy. The Norwegian National Rail Administration bought one unit (628) for maintenance, and has painted it yellow. The Norwegian Railway Museum in Hamar has preserved three units, of which two (602 and 616) were operated by GM-Gruppen and one (615) is kept for spare parts. NSB has kept one unit as reserve at Ål Station. The remaining units have been scrapped, <b>put</b> <b>aside</b> or sold as spare part units.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the list}} follows the {{sequence}} {{in which the}} operas were written. There is uncertainty about whether La finta semplice was written before or after Bastien und Bastienne, and in some listings the former is given priority. Thamos was written in two segments, the earlier in 1774, but is listed in accordance with its completion in 177980. Die Zauberflöte and La clemenza di Tito were written concurrently. Die Zauberflote was started earlier and <b>put</b> <b>aside</b> for the Tito commission, which was completed and performed first and is usually listed as the earlier work despite having a higher Köchel catalogue number.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1970s, {{during times}} of {{economic}} prosperity, Houphouët-Boigny and Senghor <b>put</b> <b>aside</b> their differences and joined forces to thwart Nigeria, which, {{in an attempt to}} establish itself in West Africa, had created the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The two countered the ECOWAS by creating the Economic Community of West Africa (ECWA), which superseded the old trade partnerships in the French-speaking regions. However, after assurances from Nigeria that ECOWAS would function {{in the same manner as}} the earlier Francophone organisations, Houphouët-Boigny and Senghor decided to merge their organization into ECOWAS in May 1975.|$|E
5|$|The first commemorative, a set {{of three}} Daniel O'Connell stamps, {{appeared}} on 22 June 1929. Until the mid-1990s, with only three exceptions in 1943, 1977 and 1979 for Douglas Hyde, Louis le Brocquy and Pope John Paul II respectively, it was policy to not depict living persons. This policy has been <b>put</b> <b>aside</b> and since 1995 {{there have been several}} such issues, mainly depicting athletes; for instance 30 stamps were issued showing living Irish sportsmen for the Millennium and several golfers are shown on three 2006 Ryder Cup stamps.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{speculative}} theories on the origin of the Brunswickers' dark and seemingly grim choice of garb. It has been suggested that black was chosen to mourn Duke Frederick William's late father; as a sign of respect for the Duke; or in mourning for the Duke's occupied homeland. Colonel Augustus Frazer, who had served alongside the Brunswickers, reported that black was adopted in mourning for the Duke's wife, Princess Marie of Baden, who had died in 1808, and that the black uniforms would not be <b>put</b> <b>aside</b> until Brunswick had been finally liberated.|$|E

5|$|Twice in May 1940 Churchill {{broached}} {{the subject of}} bringing Lloyd George into the government. Each time Chamberlain indicated that due to their longtime antipathy he would immediately retire if Lloyd George were appointed a minister. Churchill did not appoint Lloyd George, but brought up the subject with Chamberlain again early in June. This time, Chamberlain agreed to Lloyd George's appointment provided Lloyd George gave a personal assurance to <b>put</b> <b>aside</b> the feud. However, Lloyd George declined to serve in Churchill's government.|$|E
5|$|When the {{standing}} committee visited the two projects in 1996, they {{were met by}} demonstrators {{in favor of the}} bridge in Hardanger, and demonstrators in opposition to the fixed link in Sunnhordland. In May, SBT proposed building a culvert on Digernes as a compromise for a proposal from the Labour Party and the Christian Democratic Party to consider other solution, which could have postponed the project several years. Parliament decided on 11 June 1996, with 144 against 20 votes, to build the Triangle Link. The Folgefonna Tunnel was also passed, while the Hardanger Bridge was <b>put</b> <b>aside.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At some point in the last half of the twelfth century, Haraldr <b>put</b> <b>aside</b> his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a daughter of an Earl of Ross. The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the twelfth century. Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and it may well have been through Hvarflǫð, and the claims to the earldom that she passed to their children, that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E

5|$|Across the German Empire nagelfiguren, war {{memorials}} {{made from}} iron nails embedded in wood, became popular, particularly in Austria. These took various forms, including knights, shields, eagles and crosses, {{as well as}} submarines. This practice had medieval origins, and the memorials were reinforced by the promotion of burgfrieden during the war, a medieval pact in which disparate German communities would <b>put</b> <b>aside</b> their differences during a conflict. In some cases, relatives of the deceased were encouraged to hammer memorial nails in {{as part of the}} ceremonies, while children might be encouraged to read out poems in a medieval style. At some nagelfiguren a charge was made for each nail used, with the revenues donated to charities supporting soldiers, orphans and others affected by the conflict.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1971, Thorpe's {{political}} career had stalled. He had led the party to a disastrous performance in the United Kingdom general election of June 1970; in an unexpected victory for the Conservatives under Edward Heath, the Liberals lost seven of their thirteen parliamentary seats, and Thorpe's majority in North Devon fell to below 400. Bessell, with mounting business worries, did not stand for re-election in Bodmin. Thorpe faced censure for his conduct of a campaign during which he had spent extravagantly and left the party {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy; but the matter was <b>put</b> <b>aside</b> in a wave of sympathy when his wife Caroline was killed in a road accident 10 days after the election. Thorpe was devastated; he continued as leader, but for the next year performed little beyond routine party duties.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{many of the}} 1970s repairs were {{beginning}} to wear down, and the city <b>put</b> <b>aside</b> its plans for the maritime museum. The New London Railroad Company, fronted by historian Barbara Timken and local businessman Todd O'Donnell, bought the station from the city as the New London Railroad Company in 2002. The pair organized a second full restoration of the station, including a new slate roof, restored brickwork, and restoration of the waiting room to its original configuration. The mezzanine level and basement atrium created in the 1976 renovation were removed. Additionally, mechanical systems were upgraded and various accessibility concerns addressed. The baggage room was restored for Greyhound use. Amtrak and Greyhound rent space from the company for offices and passenger waiting areas.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{including}} a Stalwart on the ticket, animosity between the Republican factions carried {{over from the}} convention, and Garfield traveled to New York to meet with party leaders there. After convincing the Stalwart crowd to <b>put</b> <b>aside</b> their differences and unite for the coming campaign, Garfield returned to Ohio, leaving the active campaigning to others, as was traditional at the time. Meanwhile, the Democrats settled on their nominee, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania, a career military officer. Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the Solid South, {{while much of the}} North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign would involve a few close states, including New York and Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Fearful of Hereford's power, Richard {{unjustly}} {{orders that}} his cousin be {{banished from the}} realm for six years, {{to the dismay of}} the House of Commons and many others. Slowly dying of old age, Gaunt's final advice to Richard, that he <b>put</b> <b>aside</b> his favourites and become a just king, falls on deaf ears. Gaunt dies soon after; Richard becomes increasingly dictatorial and prevents Gaunt's vast inheritance from being granted to Bolingbroke; his banishment is converted to life, though his sons remain in the country. In the wake of these troublesome events, Richard leaves England for Ireland, a decision widely considered folly considering the turmoil England is in. Bolingbroke returns to England and many nobleman flock to his banner; Richard is overthrown.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Stiller <b>put</b> <b>aside</b> his {{directing}} ambitions {{to star in}} {{a surprise}} hit with a long-lasting cult following, the Farrelly Brothers' There's Something About Mary, alongside Cameron Diaz, which accelerated Stiller's acting career. That year, he also starred in several dramas, including Zero Effect, Your Friends & Neighbors, and Permanent Midnight. Stiller was invited {{to take part in}} hosting the Music Video awards, for which he developed a parody of the Backstreet Boys and performed a sketch with his father, commenting on his current career. In 1999, Stiller starred in three films, including Mystery Men, where he played a superhero wannabe called Mr. Furious. He returned to directing with a new television series for Fox titled Heat Vision and Jack, starring Jack Black; however, the show was not picked up by Fox after its pilot episode and the series was cancelled.|$|E
