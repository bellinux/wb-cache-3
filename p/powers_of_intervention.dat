Both wealth and bereavement therefore took Mr. Polly by surprise and found him a little inadequate. His mother's death had been a childish grief and long forgotten, and the strongest affection in his life had been for Parsons. An only child of sociable tendencies necessarily turns his back a good deal upon home, and the aunt who had succeeded his mother was an economist and furniture polisher, a knuckle rapper and sharp silencer, no friend for a slovenly little boy. He had loved other little boys and girls transitorily, none had been frequent and familiar enough to strike deep roots in his heart, and {{he had grown up}} with a tattered and dissipated affectionateness that was becoming wildly shy. His father had always been a stranger, an irritable stranger with exceptional <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> and comment, and an air of being disappointed about his offspring.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how accounting-based regulation modified {{the operation of}} one type of participant in British retail finance.

Although {{only a tiny fraction}} of existing societies were ultimately sanctioned, they all observed important deviations from specified accounting-based criteria that were generally recognized as financially sound within the industry. Intervention, however, was also motivated by two other factors: the successful lobbying by the Building Society Association to discipline non-members; and attempts by the Registrar to stop property developers from abusing moribund London-based societies. Results provide enough evidence to suggest that other studies' assessment that managers of British retail financial intermediaries disregarded accounting information in executive decisions need to be revised in light of the fact that the accounting control of building societies was supplemented by the disciplinary power granted to state regulators (as represented by the Treasury and the Registrar of Friendly Societies).

In particular, the corporatist analysis provides a framework for exploring the use of accounting-based regulation to discipline those depository financial institutions that depart from industry norms. Empirical support built upon the legislation enacted in 1959 and 1960 which set performance parameters for building societies and gave the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies new <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention.</b> These powers and parameters were used together with accounting ratios (which were generally recognised as financially sound within the industry) to discipline building societies.

In some cases accounting-based criteria were effective in driving societies to dissolution, while others, which avoided immediate dissolution were forced to improve their governance and systems of internal control. Intervention was further activated under the interdependent relationship formed between the Registrar of Friendly Societies and the Building Societies Association. Together they successfully lobbied state authorities to discipline societies outside the industry association. As a result, the evidence documented in this paper sheds light on the dynamics upon which accounting-based regulation came to be constructed and implemented...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{impact of}} {{information}} and communication technologies has resulted in the establishment of data protection authorities across Europe. Despite the role of these bodies as enforcers of privacy and data protection legislation, Surveillance Studies has so far offered little attention to their role in resistance. Based on a critical socio-legal examination of the Norwegian Data Inspectorate, the focus of this article is on the role of data protection authorities in resisting surveillance and threats to privacy and data protection. More specifically, the article asks what power the Norwegian Data Inspectorate has to achieve genuine resistance, and how its institutional structure affects this capability. Through a three-pronged analysis consisting of (i) institutional mapping, (ii) a typology of resistance strategies, and (iii) a review of its role in the Norwegian public debate on the EU Data Retention Directive, the article addresses the fundamental tension inherent in the Norwegian Data Inspectorate as a privacy-advocating ombudsman and an administrative body. As such, the research shows how, and to what extent, its institutional structure both strengthens and limits its possibilities for resistance. The growing impact {{of information and}} communication technologies has resulted in the establishment of data protection authorities across Europe.

These cover the design process as such, the specific manufacturing process, as well as the sale in its function as the means of putting the robot into circulation.

Would the resulting instrument be likely to generate more appropriate ways of dealing with labour situations, whether or not they pertain to a collective bargaining context ? Adjective as well as substantive law would have to be involved in such an exercise. The latter aspect raises the fundamental issue of the proper relationship between the general law — civil law essentially — and labour law. What degree of autonomy is necessary to the integrity of the specialized law ? Conversely, to what extent is the general law to be relied upon to provide the necessary second-line set of legal provisions ? For instance, the two sets of legal rules entertain different views as to the termination of the employment relationship and as to the effect of a collective agreement. A well-integrated body of labour law should, in the author's opinion, govern comprehensively labour situation. The codifying process would also aim at eliminating internal discrepancies and a simpler, more accessible legal subsystem would emerge. As to the adjective aspects of labour law, the identification of desirable forms of third-party intervention relating to both collective bargaining and labour standards legislation could lead to appropriate jurisdictional arrangements.

40|$|Les {{modifications}} apportées au Code canadien du travail par le législateur en 1978 ont considérablement accru le pouvoir de manoeuvre du CCRT. L'auteur fait ici une analyse et un bilan de ces trois années d'expérience. The author {{discusses the}} various means of intervention {{available to the}} CLRB when it receives applications for a declaration of unlawful strike or lockout under the provisions of theCode. As a result of amendments to theCode in June 1978, the CLRB enjoys considerable discretionary power in choosing the methods it may apply in resolving a labour dispute. Consequently, the CLRB has, {{in addition to the}} power of declaring that a strike or lockout is, was or would be unlawful in certain cases, the power to issue cease and desist orders, to consent to prosecute or in cases of noncompliance is empowered to file the said order with the Federal Court. However, in numerous disputes, it appears that a CLRB order would not be required if an effort were made to bring the parties themselves to settle the dispute which could have led to certain unlawful actions. The labour relations officers of the CLRB are immediately sent on the spot in an attempt to assist the parties in reaching a settlement. The mediation techniques used to date have been successful to a certain degree in the peaceful settlement of labour disputes. When the CLRB is required to intervene in a more direct fashion, it attempts to discover through its investigation, the underlying causes of the possible unlawful actions in order to prescribe appropriate remedies which in most cases do not address themselves solely to re-establishing the status quo ante. The author gives a practical illustration of how these means of intervention are felt, through an in-depth analysis of the Board's decisions. In theCanadian Broadcasting Corporation case, which is considered in detail among other cases in this article, the CLRB issued a cease and desist order after determining that a work stoppage was illegal and could have harmful effects not only on the Corporation from a production standpoint but also on the balance of power of the parties at the bargaining table. In addition to issuing this order, the Board decided to prescribe certain special remedies to neutralize the causes of the ills it had identified. The Board consequently ordered the parties, among other things, to refer the specific problem of the interpretation of their collective agreement to accelerated arbitration. This particular part of the order issued by the CLRB inCBC was nevertheless revoked by the Federal Court of Appeal on April 8, 1981. In his article, the author anticipates certain possible future controversies concerning the CLRB's <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> should this Federal Court judgment be upheld. The author concludes that in view of the special nature of the Board's powers in this area, intervention {{on the part of the}} CLRB should not be equated with the jurisdiction exercised by Common Law courts when they are called upon to issue injunctions in the case of certain labour disputes...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} {{and quality of}} EU democracy is greatly determined by the status that the European Union accords both to the European Parliament and to national parliaments. The potential that national parliaments carry for providing political accountability and democratic legitimacy to the EU decision-making processes in various fields of action has long been neglected. This study explores the role of national parliaments not only as actors of their own Member States but of the European Union as a larger constitutional compound. The study focuses on the parliaments of France, the United Kingdom and Portugal, which provide a representative sample as regards the system of government, the structure of parliament, the date of accession and so on. The analysis {{is divided into three}} parts. Part I deals with the conditions under which national parliaments consent to the transfer of sovereignty to the Union. As the powers that they formerly enjoyed are to some extent taken over by the European Parliament, it was important to inquire whether national parliaments perceive the European Parliament as a partner or rival in effecting the accountability of EU executive institutions. The examples of the Coal and Steel Community Treaty, Maastricht Treaty and Lisbon Treaty show that a sense of partnership tends to prevail. Part II delves into the Europeanisation of national parliaments and the correspondent reform of their competences of scrutiny over draft EU initiatives. While the constitutional contexts within which the selected parliaments operate differ, they have successfully adapted their scrutiny systems to the requirements of the post-Lisbon era. In formal terms, this enables them to participate in the scrutiny of EU policies satisfactorily. Part III adds a qualitative empirical element to the analysis and tests whether and, if so, how national parliaments use their scrutiny powers in practice. We ask what claims they make {{as a result of their}} scrutiny. In the in-depth case studies of the Services Directive, the EU-US SWIFT Agreements and the European External Action Service Decision, we examine the attitudes of national parliaments towards different EU policy fields and different types of EU decisions, regarding which the European Parliament possessed different <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention.</b> Applying the method of parliamentary interdependence, we seek to find out whether the actorship of national parliaments is correlative to that of other parliamentary actors existing within the Union. The insight gained is that where an EU dossier is highly politically salient and gives rise to widespread contestation, national parliaments are likely to respond, often with quite specific demands. What is remarkable is that their response is not always addressed at the national government but sometimes also at EU institutions directly. Part IV is interpretational. It argues that national parliaments occupy an important place on the map of EU democracy and that they at times act as EU organs. Their proximity to the electorate makes them an essential link between the citizens and the Union...|$|E

40|$|The {{regulation}} of short selling {{is one of}} the most debated topics of the immediate post-crisis financial regulatory landscape. Notwithstanding, nothing – or at least very little – has been written about it moving the analysis of such controversial issue from a legal perspective. Against this background, the main purpose of this work is to complement the ongoing international policy discussion enriching the existent debate with new considerations which are deemed to be essential for a deeper understanding of such investment technique. In particular, it presents a comprehensive analysis of short selling regimes as currently in place in the United States and at the European Union level, in the wider context of transatlantic dialogues. In doing so, the study of short selling regulations is proposed along to two main descriptive lines of research, which are clearly reflected in two distinct, although interconnected, parts. Common thread of Part I (Short Selling Regulation from a Comparative Perspective) can be identified in the need to provide solid methodological justification to the research. Chapter 1 investigates first of all the reasons behind the adoption of a comparative law perspective in the analysis of short selling regulation, moving from the scrutiny of short selling as described until now by economic studies. In particular, it moves from commenting on the status quo of research – with reference both to the identification of the different ‘mechanisms’ of short sales and to their impact on financial markets – evidencing economists’ difficulties in providing an uncontroversial response on whether regulatory intervention in this field is need. A legal perspective becomes thus critical in order to fill the gaps left by economic analysis, bringing to the debate considerations on the role of regulation in the direction of financial markets and on the necessity to provide market operators with a safe environment relying on legal certainty of financial operations. In this sense, the research further investigate the added value of a comparative approach in addressing risks posed by potential divergences in the {{regulation of}} short selling, in particular with reference to risks of ‘regulatory arbitrage’, upholding the key role of comparative law in the as transitional step towards international regulatory harmonization. Chapter 2 faces instead the absence of comparative law research in the field of financial regulation, questioning the appropriateness of the comparative law traditional methodology once applied to the topic in hand. In this respect, criticisms move from evidencing that financial regulation has been traditionally disregarded as object of comparison, tracing back this lack of interest in the difficulties in ascribing it within classical comparative law categories. In this sense, this work support the abandonment of a rigid compartmentalization – addressing in particular, the private/public law distinction, legal families, and the impact of globalization on comparative studies – in order to show that comparative studies on financial regulation are possible, but require a flexible methodology. Lastly, Chapter 3 will deal with the rationale behind a comparison of short selling regulations enacted by two different ‘forms of government’: the United States, as main point of reference and pioneer in the regulation of financial markets since the Great Crush of 1929, and the European Union, as its emerging new counter-party in international regulatory dialogues. In this context, it held that despite institutionally different – the former being a federal State and the latter a supranational organization – regulatory choices recently undertaken by the European Union show strong signs of convergence towards the traditional approach which characterizes financial regulation in the United States, at least from the perspective of the interaction between the Union and its Member States. This position is supported by the analysis of the U. S. ´dual system’ of financial regulation against strong harmonization trends in the EU Framework, observed from the adoption of the EU Financial Services Action Plan to the project for a EU Single European Rulebook. As a consequence, comparison of these two sets of rules represents, at the current stage, the most appropriate choice for a comparative analysis of short selling regulations, also in light of the increasing importance of transatlantic regulatory dialogues. Part II of the research (Short Selling Regulatory Choices – European Union and United States Compared) is then dedicated to the in depth comparative analysis of the current regulatory framework of short selling in the in the United States and in the European Union, in order to support the methodological assumption on the convergence of the two normative frameworks. Chapter 4, after addressing the main evolutionary steps in the regulation of short selling from an historical perspective, provides an overview of the regulations which are in force, at the current juncture, in the two systems. In particular, space is given to the regulatory debates which led to the enactment of Regulation SHO for United States and of Regulation 236 / 2012 for the European Union, offering a preliminary outline of the main legislative measures governing short selling. Chapter 5 thus enters into the detail of the analysis of the content of the two regulatory regimes. In particular, it describes the scope of application of Regulation 236 / 2012 and Regulation SHO, moving the analysis from emphasising the importance of legal definitions in the context of short selling. Against a widespread common understanding on the mechanics of short sales, the absence of clear legal definitions represented a misleading element in the study of short selling regulations, since generic reference to this practice has often led researchers to take for granted that measures adopted in different legislations were referring to the exact same phenomenon. Consistently, short selling is described focusing on the definitions provided under the two regulatory frameworks, with specific reference to the impact of the concept of ‘ownership’, of the calculation of ‘positions’ and of the privileged treatment of professional investors embodied in the U. S. regime. Scope of the two frameworks is then completed by the identification of the instruments covered and of their geographical applicability, with specific reference to the controversial issue of extraterritoriality. Chapter 6 presents the core provisions of the two regulatory frameworks, namely the way in which EU and U. S. legislators addressed short selling with reference to transparency of transactions and to the particular risks posed by ‘naked’ short selling. With respect to the first, it provides on overview on pro and cons of two divergent approaches: a notification and disclosure regime, as adopted in the EU, and a ‘marking’ system, as in force in the U. S. As for the second, it addressed the instruments adopted by the EU and U. S. regulators in order to curb the risks connected to ‘naked’ short selling. Main focus is posed on the functioning of ‘locate rules’ and on the application of ‘buy-in’ or ‘close-out’ requirements, with references to the measures implemented in order to address short selling when used as instrument for market abuses. In addition, attention is paid to the exceptions provided for the applicability of those rules, with emphasis on the different approaches adopted in the treatment of ‘market marking’ activities. Ultimately, Chapter 7 completes the analysis of short selling regulatory frameworks addressing <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> granted to national competent authorities in order to face risks posed by short under specific circumstances. In particular, it describes the treatment of short selling in declining markets, under discretional and automatic ‘circuit breakers’, as well as extra-ordinary powers triggered by ‘exceptional’ or ‘emergency’ circumstances. In this context, particular attention is paid to the European regime, setting forth rules for the interaction among Member States competent authorities and the European Securities and Markets Authority. Cooperation arrangements are also taken into consideration under an international dimension, identifying the main instruments which foster the establishment of effective information sharing systems and collaboration in the enforcement of short selling regulatory regimes. ...|$|E
40|$|Like in a paradox, urban-rural (periurban and rurban) spaces still {{represent}} an empty space {{to be filled}} within the laws and the models that physical and development planning are facing today, in Italy Indeed, it is paradoxical that, since 1942 (year {{of the first and}} still in force national town planning law), the urban-rural spaces have been dealt with as follows: •	left over and economically marginal in the frame of socio-economic development plans (an important part of planning), even the traditional ones (first generation planning, only based on the land rent mechanism); •	as empty spaces, pending to be filled up by an increasing urbanization, or eventually abandoned, because inaccessible to that; •	as undifferentiated, because too wide and uniform in the organization system to make their central business core visible. Although this “big empty” is easy to ascribe to the functionalist culture – ruling until the eighties, structurally conditioned by the political and economic debate on the profit and the rent topics –, it is necessary to underline that other variables have played against a more accurate positioning of the urban-rural areas in the national planning process. As a starting point, we may call to mind both the results of the agrarian reform and its synthetic derivatives in the “Progetto 80 ”, the discontinuous action of the “Cassa per il Mezzogiorno”, the conflict between intensive and extensive production models, the temporal volatility of the planned European guidelines and the regional policies in respect of the urban or agricoltural development’s cycles, … And we could still go on for long. But, at this time, it is important to discuss and expand on two relationships’ levels: •	to the town •	to the environment It is just from the unsuccessful relationship to the first one (lack of urban entities as in the “Italian Mezzogiorno”, or too close and ambiguous dependence from them {{as in the case of}} the wide Central–Northern urban areas), that the progressive weakening of the environmental values derives. The periurban spaces are bearers of these values, so that this means to disappoint – in a traditional vision – the planning issues, as these are some of the parameters and inalienable characters of the complex regional space in which the territory is organized to dictate its own planning rules. On the other hand, in the discussion on regional periurban planning it is seldom possible to count on a true multi-scalar approach, which breaks down the indicators in relation to the geographical scale (regional, sub-regional, and local). In the same way, it seems difficult to distinguish types of periurban characters in areas which are very different among them, even if the periurban economies are today considered locally vital for the maintenance of productive systems that find no correspondence to stable socio-economic and settlement structures (like in the case of the Rome periurban/rurban area or Molise intermunicipal areas). In such situations, it is still possible to read the sequence of the conflict which precedes the integration: discontinuous human presence, concentrated in areas geo-morphologically and climatically not always favourable; absence of stable environmental protection planning in spite of the high regional degree of naturality; negation of a social and economical value of the environment by the local settlements communities. So, it is right to wonder what might be the future geoeconomic and geopolitic structure to be given to those urban systems where the attitude to a sustainable development based on the performance of periurban spaces seems to be, once again paradoxically, a limit for a balanced growth. Therefore, this research aims at two main goals: •	To provide an operative contribution to the definition of the general or structural characters of the periurban economies in sub-regional area (intermunicipal scale, with particular reference to the Rome province) •	To verify if types of periruban areas could be given an outstanding weight/role for the tuning of suitable development planning policies, and to what degree of innovation. This report aims at discussing urban-rural typologies in a perspective of planning for a vast provincial area, the Provincia of Rome, that, with its frameworks and <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention,</b> cannot neglect facing the “metropolitan district” issue, as one of the fundamental terms to be carefully considered when speaking of the Italian Capital city in a possible European federalist vision. The work, based on a research on subsidiarity typologies for new local and over-local development, tests a method that differs from the past ones, for the inclusion of new formulae and principles -in particular, sustainability- towards which the economic-territorial regionalisation is intended to be oriented. The same principles has prompted geo-economic research into the ESPON Programme, to assess ex-ante the impact that urban-rural system could have on the economic-territorial federalist organisation of Italy (Prezioso 1997, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003). In fact, the assessment of the impacts of transforming the current regional monocentrism to equipotential polycentrism on a local level, provokes the question of the principles upon which the European community itself should model the system of local government (territorial planning of a large area) as well as under which conditions (governing regulations), and if current regulations are to guide the choice, as is the case in Italy, so that local communities maintain potential resources for future generations, though steering them towards progressive growth awareness. This paper deals with two questions concerning the general problem: -	technical-formal, referring to techniques and procedures that are useful in identifying urban-rural areas and frameworks subsidiary to the demand for their organisation, hereby joining the geographical scale to the administrative level most appropriate for the government, as well as the organisation of the territory; -	State-run and managerial, regulations and tools to be employed; an unavoidable condition to uphold economic choices that conform appropriately to the principle of sustainability within prescribed times; acting within the European context of research on the integration (that means transversal concentration including both horizontal and vertical concentrations), which is the driving mechanism for all of the different planning processes in progress. The Italian Research Group has considered the ESPON Programme as an important starting point, in particular by the Research Framework of the 1. 1. 2 Project, which financially supports research on endogenous solutions, by identifying the framework of geo-economic action of local governments in a large area (NUTS 3). In most cases in Italy, this coincides with the spaces of provincial action; the governing bodies alone are able to accomplish all of the instrumental stages that permit the unioning of the qualification and functionality of the spaces (intraregional or intermunicipal areas), which are co-ordinated toward a single, co-operative end, thus involving them in competition on a transnational level. The European Union and many administrative, provincial frameworks have found a meeting point in the search for new planning. Stakeholders, local boards, management, citizens/shareholders-clients in the territory and economy have already confirmed a real wish to overcome, whether literally or figuratively, the borders of their own areas of interest, in order not to leave the realisation of integration, as in the past, to already developed regions where the productive groundwork is firmer. For this purpose, many regions and boundaries have been created, with the univocity of conditions and the cohesion (or coherence) of the distinct units, i. e. regional interrelation, as the main criteria. This is intended as a visible aspect of integration or, rather, a political-economic-geographic work method that makes the realisation of objectives and projects possible because of a voluntary, spontaneous attitude, which, preceded by sharing common principles, manifests itself in planning/project agreements. National and European deliberations on the subject have shown that, at the root of individual experiences, there is an attempt to methodologically unify spaces that are environmentally and functionally different. By creating sub-systems that differ in their efficiency, mass and cohesion, an identical decision-making process (sustainability) tends to guide the management of diversely located, anthropic and physical resources. The layout varies from strategic planning experiences of large areas in progress or computed in recent years in Italy and Europe (Naples, Bari, Turin, Milan, Bologna, Barcelona, Lille), in which the interrelation as one of the planning issues has been derived from a coercive action (the plan of a hierarchical-functional network). In this perspective, the plan becomes the central and centralising place of a strong idea/project offer and it’s indifferent to the real demand and the “bottom up” organisation and development. In these cases, the limits of functional areas are already outlined in the way in which metropolitan, provincial and regional plans are presented (general-territorial or for co-ordination). Importance is attached to highlighting not only those elements that oppose integration and favour competitive co-operation (global competition), acted out on a political-commercial level for the propagation of entrepreneurial and common management models, but also entrepreneurial co-operation when geographical expansion of the integration processes requires regulation of the use of resources. Among the sectors that have assumed a greater weight in outlining integration limits in strategic planning, that of services for knowledge, information and communication infrastructures stands out. At first, the European Union (EU) contributed a structural role in starting up a cohesive dialogue in this regard, hereby presuming that the “best co-operation” (or good governance) among regions would only occur if property, people, capital and information cross a border to be received or supplied. This layout basically leads to the passage from one system to another and it is rather difficult to represent the updating value and perspective dynamics according to conventional urban planning, of which the plan is the instrument. In addition, there are so-called stable structural factors (high speed, data technology, technical and network resources, etc.), which do not necessarily produce coherent planning, even though a logical continuity exists between the integration process and integration product. The more the strategic and functional indicators were studied, broken down and updated to assimilate innovations, the more the territory moved away from the representation of the resource systems that had generated it and the common regulations that had sustained local demand (absence of governance, crisis of technical standards and regulations). On a local level, it is essential to identify elements that define the capacity or physical and political amplitude of the cohesion (e. g. the pertinent metropolitan territory) ...|$|E

Mejido argues that liberation theology should incorporate psychoanalysis and he elaborates this approach in reference to Žižek. We will conclude by suggesting that while Moldonado-Torres critique and Mejido’s appropriation of psychoanalysis are significant in their awareness of Žižek’s potential contribution, they ultimately fail to recognize the nature and critical <b>power</b> <b>of</b> his <b>intervention</b> into the theory of liberatory politics and religio...|$|R

40|$|The {{technological}} innovation systems (TIS) framework provides a theory to understand {{under what conditions}} {{technological innovation}}s are successfully developed and implemented. The objective of this dissertation is to further strengthen this TIS intervention framework, which {{is the part of}} the TIS theoretical framework that facilitates the identification of inhibiting problems and the formulation <b>of</b> <b>interventions.</b> Theoretical adaptations and extensions are proposed and their merits subsequently explored during case studies that relate to the empirical domain of energy-efficient housing in the Netherlands. To start with, although the framework emphasizes the dynamic nature of the innovation process, problems are conceptualized and commonly analyzed as independent entities. During a case study of newly-built energy-efficient houses in the Netherlands, it is explored whether giving explicit attention to problem interactions yields contrasting or additional insights compared to an analysis of independent problems. It is found that problems may together form a problematic mechanism, and that intervention on all the problems that form the mechanism is then of little value and can even be counterproductive. Secondly, the TIS intervention framework currently does not provide the theoretical means for coping with inconsistent opinions on what the problems and best interventions are. The merits of taking a subjectivist view that allows multiple ‘truths’ about problems and solutions to coexist are explored during a case study of the Dutch innovation system of renovating houses energy efficiently. It is found that there are two viewpoints on renovation prominent that have their origin in two distinct ‘institutional logics’, namely the so-called ‘steps logic’ that leads to renovation in consecutive steps and the ‘leaps-logic’ that leads to renovation in a single leap. These institutional logics explain why actors are perceiving different problems and are also proposing different solutions for this innovation system. Thirdly, in literature it is often mentioned that the sector tends to form a relatively stable environment for TISs. However, it is found that the success of the heat pump in the Netherlands (and the type of heat pump) depends much on how the current debate on what renovation approach to follow plays out (either in consecutive steps or in a single leap). As this debate developed autonomously at sectoral level, it is concluded that sectoral context may also form a rather unstable environment for TISs. Finally, the question what type <b>of</b> <b>intervention,</b> or set <b>of</b> <b>interventions,</b> is likely to have a large impact on improving the functioning of an innovation system remains unanswered. The objective was set to lay a preliminary foundation for a conceptual framework based on an idea from systems thinking theory, namely that the transformational <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> relates to the characteristics of the points in a system where the intervention acts upon. This reasoning is used to create a preliminary ranking <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> for the TIS framework. Through a case study of highly energy-efficient houses it is illustrated how the ranking can be used as addition to an innovation systems analysis...|$|R
