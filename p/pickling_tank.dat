50|$|The rods {{were cut}} into 22-foot lengths {{as they leave}} the last stand {{by means of a}} flying shear. The Savannah rods were air cooled to room {{temperature}} on the cooling bed and then were cold straightened in a Medart Straightener. Rods to be beta heat treated by-pass the cooling bed and were lifted into the beta heat treating furnace by means of a hoist, to be held at 1,320-1,365 Â°F for 11-20 minutes and then quenched in cold water. After quenching, these rods were conveyed to the Medart straightener for straightening. The rods were located in -inch Acme-Gridley automatic screw machines where slugs were cut from the rods. The Hanford slugs were then placed in the Heald machine, which cuts the slugs to desired lengths and finishes and radiuses the ends. The Savannah River slugs were reduced to exact dimensions of size, surface, and straightness on a centerless grinder after which a contour was placed on the surface by a thread rolling machine. The slugs were numbered and put on a basket on a conveyor that passes through a degreasing tank, <b>pickling</b> <b>tank,</b> two rinse tanks and a hot air dryer before depositing the slug basket in the Inspection Department. The slugs were inspected for seams, striations, dimensions and handling defects with the good slugs being packed for shipment.|$|E

5000|$|The Detroit {{plant is}} a {{finishing}} facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units are two 50 in., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold anneal and pickle line, a temper mill, two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills, are essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and combined, {{they both have}} an annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line was installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consists of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace where the strip is heated above [...] and three acid <b>pickling</b> <b>tanks</b> followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper is interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.|$|R
5000|$|... "Freak Scene" [...] {{is rated}} {{as one of}} the best songs by Dinosaur Jr. In his review of Bug, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the track [...] "the {{masterpiece}} of the record, [...] [...] [...] a surprisingly catchy song encapsulating the appeal and pitfalls of indie rock within three minutes." [...] Jess Harvell of Pitchfork believes [...] "'Freak Scene' is probably indie rock's greatest guitar performance and the band's greatest pop song, somehow finding room for Psychedelic Furs jangle, Edge-style ascending harmonies, Eddie Van Halen in the drunk <b>tank,</b> <b>pickled</b> country, and a cherry on top in three and a half minutes without feeling at all cluttered." [...] The single reached number seven in the UK Indie Chart, and spent 12 weeks on the chart in total.|$|R
