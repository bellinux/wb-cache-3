50|$|The {{duration}} of the curing process varies {{by the type of}} ham, with Serrano ham curing in 9-12 months, <b>Parma</b> <b>hams</b> taking more than 12 months, and Iberian ham taking up to 2 years to reach the desired flavour characteristics.

50|$|The aroma and {{the aroma}} {{compounds}} of Jinhua ham {{are similar to}} that of dry-cured Iberian hams but different from light Italian and <b>Parma</b> <b>hams.</b> This is likely due to the longer aging and environmental exposure of both Jinhua and Iberian hams. The fragrant compounds consist of aldehydes, sulfur compounds such as methanethiol and dimethyl disulfide, and branched alkenes, which are derived from the breakdown and rearrangement of amino acids and fatty acids caused by auto-oxidation and fermentation.|$|R

2500|$|Starter whey (containing {{a mixture}} of certain {{thermophilic}} lactic acid bacteria) is added, and the temperature is raised to 33–35°C (91–95°F). Calf rennet is added, and the mixture is left to curdle for 10–12 minutes. The curd is then broken up mechanically into small pieces (around the size of rice grains). The temperature is then raised to 55°C (131°F) with careful control by the cheese-maker. The curd is left to settle for 45–60 minutes. The compacted curd is collected {{in a piece of}} muslin before being divided in two and placed in molds. There is 1100 L (291 US gallons or 250 imperial gallons) of milk per vat, producing two cheeses each. The curd making up each wheel at this point weighs around 45kg (100lb).

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} dietary conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) supplementation on cis- 9, trans- 11 and trans- 10, cis- 12 isomer content and on the fatty acid composition of subcutaneous adipose tissue and intramuscular lipids of biceps femoris, the lipids of 24 dry cured <b>Parma</b> <b>hams,</b> obtained from Large White pigs fed isoenergetic diets supplemented with either 0 (CON) or 0. 25 % (T 1) CLA from 97 to 172 kg live weight, were analysed by Ag+-HPLC and capillary GLC. The dietary treatment had no influence on lipid content of BF and subcutaneous adipose tissue but increased (P< 0. 01) the content of both isomers, more markedly in the latter tissue. CLA supplementation increased (P< 0. 01) myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic and total saturated fatty acids, and decreased oleic and eicosenoic acids in both tissues. In adipose tissue, an increase (P< 0. 05) in stearic acid content was observed. Supplementing the finishing diet of heavy pigs with CLA has thus shown {{to be an effective}} tool for increasing the CLA content in cured ham and, also, the saturated: unsaturated ratio of the lipids, a positive effect from a technological point of view. From a human nutritional standpoint, the changes occurring in fatty acid composition negatively affect the atherogenic and thrombogenic indexes, but probably these changes are of no particular concern, as they would only partly offset the progressive increase in the degree of unsaturation of heavy pig lipid:, that has occurred in recent years, as a consequence of reduced adipose depots in carcasses. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of intramuscular lipids and adipose covering tissue was studied on 45 <b>Parma</b> <b>hams</b> obtained from Duroc x Cotswold heavy pigs (carcass weight 129. 5 ± 8. 0 kg). Prior to slaughtering, {{which took place}} at an average liveweight of about 160 kg, the animals were fed on a diet integrated with 8 mg/kg of vitamin E for 95 days (C), 200 mg/kg for 65 days (T 1) or 200 mg/kg for 95 days (T 2). The intramuscular lipids, amounting {{to a total of}} 3. 38 %, contained, on average, 35. 6 % of saturated (SFA), 48. 5 % of monounsaturated (MUFA) and 15. 9 % polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids. The dietary levelof vitamin E had no statistically significant effect on fatty acid composition of intramuscular lipids, although the animals of groups T 1 and T 2 showed lipids tendentially richer in PUFA. The neutral fraction of intramuscular lipids comprising 35. 5 % of SFA, 56. 5 % of MUFA and 8. 0 % of PUFA, was found to be richer in PUFA in hams from pigs with higher vitamin E integration. However, there was no effect of the treatment on the composition of polar lipids, which were found to consist of 31. 9 % of SFA, 20. 6 % of MUFA and 47. 5 % ofPUFA. The lipids in the adipose covering tissue, comprising an average of 36. 9 % SFA, 46. 0 % MUFA and 17. 1 % PUFA, were tendentially more unsaturated in animals with higher integration of the diet.

40|$|The {{focus of}} our {{research}} is the province of Cuneo and its agricultural economy and production. Cuneo {{is located in the}} North West part of Italy and it represents for extension {{one of the most important}} provinces in the Italian scene. In particular our interest is on small and medium farms that, for their nature, represent the real fulcrum of Cuneo's economy. Analyzing the current situation of food-producing, it's evident how productive processes are linear and based overall on quantity and not quality. In this way the territory has lost the link with its history, local values and know- how to pursue the globalization ideal and receipts. It happens that in a province like Cuneo, South American cereal are grown and imported to feed English breed of swine, that are going to be one of the most popular Italian products: <b>Parma's</b> raw <b>ham!</b> The real problem is that some cultivations have replaced the native ones, and some others, as cereals, are insufficient to provide for territory needs; so products coming from small farms are devalued, because they are sold by large retailers without any indication about their provenance and peculiarity. Moreover all weaving factories have natural outputs, considered as wastes. Applying the systemic approach to the Cuneo's district we connected the different weaving factories, breeding and agriculture ones, creating a kind of consortium, in which they share knowledge, potential, products and overall outputs to pursue goals in common and to create new opportunity, dividing cost and pay-off. This is called Systemic Consortium. So the real challenge is changing the way we think about sustainability, only with dialogue and collaboration between the local weaving factory, it's possible to create a correct and fair development: a network in which output becomes input, wastes are resources and the processes are in balance with territory and ecosyste...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{ascertain}} the effect of the geographical origin and the production process of dry-cured ham on the variability of the stable isotope ratios of the most important bioelements (2 H/ 1 H, 13 C/ 12 C, 15 N/ 14 N, 18 O/ 16 O, 34 S/ 32 S). Overall, 11 isotope ratios were examined in three ham fractions: defatted dry matter of biceps femoris muscle and fat of biceps femoris muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue. The experimental hams were made out of pigs reared in three geographical areas (two in Italy – Friuli and Emilia – and one in Spain). In every location different productive factors were assessed as a potential source of isotope ratio variability, following suitable experimental designs. In particular, the effect of pig genetic type and rearing system was examined on 36 hams from heavy pigs belonging to three genotypes (Cinta Senese, Mora Romagnola and a commercial hybrid) kept on the same diet in Friuli both in stable or outdoor, in a fenced woody area. The influence of pig feeding regime was analysed by comparing the isotope ratios of 26 Dehesa de Extremadura PDO hams, obtained from heavy pigs fattened outdoor on grazed feedstuffs without (“Bellota” Iberian hams) or with concentrate supplement (“Campo” Iberian hams). The processing influence was examined on 36 hams from pigs reared on the same farm and diet in Emilia and seasoned for three different periods following the procedures of the three main Italian PDO <b>hams</b> (<b>Parma,</b> San Daniele and Toscano). The subcutaneous fat of these hams was sampled at both the outer (as usual) and inner layer. The first results indicate that the processing procedure factors and pig genotype do not have effect on the stable isotope ratios, whereas the geographical origin and the pig feeding regime have a significant effect...|$|R
