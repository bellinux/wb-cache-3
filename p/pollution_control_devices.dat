40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} a pollution tax as a <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> <b>device</b> on the output and location decisions of undifferentiated oligopolistic firms with free entry. It shows that the optimum output and location of an oligopolistic firm is independent of a change in the pollution tax if the demand function is linear. Furthermore, an increase in the pollution tax will increase (decrease) output and move the plant location toward (away from) the CBD if the demand function is concave (convex). It also shows that a higher pollution tax will increase the pollution damage if the demand function is linear and the location effect dominates the demand effect. These results are significantly different from the conventional results based on the monopolistic location model.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to improve the {{principles}} of the pathogenetic therapy of acute pancreatitis and assess the effectiveness of local hypothermia of the pancreas, as well as peritoneal lavage-dialysis in the treatment of acute destructive pancreatitis. A total of 5889 patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) were examined. The leading role played by the lesions of the pancreatic lymphatic system in the development of destructive processes was noted. In experiments done on eight dogs, the first day of experimental acute pancreatitis showed necrosis of the lumbar retroperitoneal lymph nodes with a violation of lymph drainage from the pancreas before the retroperitoneal fat necrosis was initiated. The effectiveness of local hypothermia of the pancreas was experimentally demonstrated. In 32 patients with AP, the perioperative local hypothermia of the pancreas for 20 - 25 minutes was followed by the reduction of the alpha-amylase activity in the peripheral blood and in the portal system, as well as a significant reduction in the edema of the pancreas, that delayed the progression of the destructive lesions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the PCDD/Fs emissions measured from a coal–fired {{power plant in}} Malaysia. The study discusses partitioning of PCDD/Fs in particle and gas phase, effects of coal quality to PCDD/Fs formation, effects of air <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> <b>device</b> (APCD) configuration to PCDD/Fs formation and establishment of emission factors of PCDD/Fs from the studied coal–fired power plant. The results presented {{in this study were}} mostly in good agreement with the previous works on PCDD/Fs emissions conducted in other countries. Laboratory analysis results showed that PCDFs were the dominant congeners. The emissions of PCDD/Fs were low which most probably due to the high combustion efficiency. The PCDFs/PCDDs ratio was more than 1 and PCDD/Fs were detected in fly ash, hence speculating that the formation of PCDD/Fs during coal combustion was mainly through de novo synthesis. Analysis on partitioning of PCDD/Fs showed that the compounds were mainly emitted in gas phase. This study also indicated that type of coal influenced the formation of PCDD/Fs during coal combustion where bituminous coal with high sulfur (S) content resulted in slightly lower PCDD/Fs emissions compared to sub–bituminous coal. It was also found that operation of flue gas desulfurization (FGD) reduced the emission of PCDD/Fs. The established emission factors for PCDD/Fs were in the range of 0. 08 to 0. 11 ng I–TEQ/kg...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: Hospital wastes pose {{a serious}} public health problem. This is {{primarily}} {{caused by the}} way individual components of the waste is handled. One acceptable method for managing the medical waste is incineration but uncontrolled incinerators can cause emission of pollutants to atmosphere. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate pollutants emission from hospital waste incinerators in Hamadan. Materials and methods: In this investigation, samples were collected from Emam, Syna, Fatemieh, Mobasher Kashani hospital incinerators to determine the level of lead, mercury, cadmium, benzene, toluene. Xylene, carbon monoxide, sulphour dioxide and particulate. Collected samples were analysed using gas chromatograph, atomic absorbtion, spectrometer and smoke meter in the laboratory or by SO 2 and CO meter as a direct method in the field. Results: Results show that Mobasher hospital has maximum concentration of metals fume such as lead, mercury, cadmium (1113, 540, 3340 mg/m 3, respectively). Mean concentration of sulphour dioxide was 127 ppm and for suspended particulate concentration was 639 mg/m 3. In Syna hospital, the concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons including benzene, toluene, xylene and carbon monoxide were maximum (77. 46, 108. 64, 33. 6 mg/m 3 and 1041 ppm respectively). Conclusion: It can be concluded that hospital atmospheric pollutants are higher than EPA standards, at least with P< 0. 05 which can be due to inopportune opening door of combustion chamber, input of excess air mass, low temperature, unmixed solid waste and unsuitable design of the incinerator, and leak or unsuitable <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> <b>device...</b>|$|R
