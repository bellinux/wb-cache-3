5|$|Balla's {{interest}} in capturing {{a single moment}} {{in a series of}} <b>planes</b> was inspired by his fascination with chronophotography. In later, more abstract works created during World War I, Balla used <b>planes</b> of color to suggest movement.|$|E
5|$|In February 1999, Braathens {{announced}} that they would re-register all their <b>planes</b> in Sweden {{to avoid having to}} pay value added tax on catering and fuel. Color Air and SAS, who had their <b>planes</b> registered abroad, had gotten away without paying the taxes, since it only applied to Norway-registered <b>planes.</b> Following this announcement, the Ministry of Finance changed the rules so also foreign-owned <b>planes</b> had to pay the tax. The change in rules cost Color Air NOK10 million per plane per year. From 1 July 1999, the seat tax was removed, but replaced by an equivalent tax for each passenger. This made it cheaper to fly an empty plane, but more expensive to fly a full one. Color Air had reduced the number of seats in each plane to avoid the seat tax, but increased them again after the tax was removed.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, {{all three}} members of the class were {{modified}} to carry a pair of float <b>planes</b> for reconnaissance. They were equipped with an aircraft catapult to launch the <b>planes</b> and cranes to recover them after they landed in the water. The ships initially carried two Heinkel He 60 biplane float <b>planes,</b> replaced later in the decade with two Arado Ar 196 monoplane float <b>planes.</b> Only one aircraft could be stored on the catapult at a time; the second plane had to be disassembled and placed in storage, and the ships did not have a hangar to store it in.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, a <b>plane</b> {{curve is}} a curve in a <b>plane</b> {{that may be}} either a Euclidean <b>plane,</b> an affine <b>plane</b> or a {{projective}} <b>plane.</b> The most frequently studied cases are smooth <b>plane</b> curves (including piecewise smooth <b>plane</b> curves), and algebraic <b>plane</b> curves.|$|R
50|$|The {{transverse}} <b>plane</b> (also {{called the}} horizontal <b>plane,</b> axial <b>plane,</b> or transaxial <b>plane)</b> is an imaginary <b>plane</b> that divides the body into superior and inferior parts. It is {{perpendicular to the}} coronal <b>plane</b> and sagittal <b>plane.</b>|$|R

5|$|On 19 February 1942, the Japanese carrier {{striking}} force, {{consisting of}} aircraft carriers Akagi, Kaga, Hiryu, and Soryu {{under the command}} of Admiral Chuichi Nagumo, launched 189 <b>planes</b> to attack Darwin. The carrier <b>planes</b> rendezvoused with 54 land-based bombers from Kendari and Ambon.|$|E
5|$|On 5 June 1984, two Saudi Arabian {{fighter pilots}} shot down two Iranian F-4 fighters. The Royal Saudi Air Force pilots were flying American-built F-15s and fired air-to-air {{missiles}} {{to bring down}} the Iranian <b>planes.</b> The Saudi fighter pilots had KC-135 aerial tanker <b>planes</b> and Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS surveillance <b>planes</b> assist in the encounter. The aerial fight occurred in Saudi airspace over the Gulf near the Saudi island Al Arabiyah, about 60 miles northeast of Jubail.|$|E

5000|$|In system diagrams, the {{management}} <b>plane</b> is typically shown {{in three dimensions}} as overlapping the network stack, separated by a dimension that delineates the power <b>plane,</b> data <b>plane,</b> control <b>plane</b> and management <b>plane.</b>|$|R
50|$|The second special <b>plane</b> is the {{sagittal}} <b>plane.</b> This {{is defined}} as the <b>plane,</b> orthogonal to the tangential <b>plane,</b> which contains the object point being considered and intersects the optical axis at the entrance pupil of the optical system. This <b>plane</b> contains the chief ray, but does not contain the optic axis. It is therefore a skew <b>plane,</b> in other words not a meridional <b>plane.</b> Rays propagating in this <b>plane</b> are called sagittal rays.|$|R

5|$|An {{emergency}} airlift of critically needed items began {{almost immediately}} from the United States to the Far East. The Military Air Transport Service (MATS), Pacific Division, expanded rapidly after {{the outbreak of}} the war. The Pacific airlift was further expanded by the charter of civil airlines <b>planes.</b> The Canadian Government lent the United Nations a Royal Canadian Air Force squadron of six transports, while the Belgian Government added several DC-4s to the effort. Altogether, the fleet of about 60 four-engine transport <b>planes</b> operating across the Pacific before June 25, 1950, was quickly expanded to approximately 250. In addition to these, there were MATS C-74 Globemaster and C-97 Stratofreighter <b>planes</b> operating between the United States and Hawaii.|$|E
50|$|In the {{analysis}} of these systems, {{it is common to}} consider tangential rays (as defined above), and rays in a meridional <b>plane</b> (a <b>plane</b> containing the optic axis) perpendicular to the tangential <b>plane.</b> This <b>plane</b> is called either the sagittal meridional <b>plane</b> or, confusingly, just the sagittal <b>plane.</b>|$|R
50|$|The jointer <b>plane</b> (also {{known as}} the try <b>plane</b> or trying <b>plane)</b> {{is a type of}} hand <b>plane</b> used {{primarily}} to straighten the edges of boards in the operation known as jointing. A jointer <b>plane</b> may also be used to flatten the face of a board. Its long length is designed to 'ride over' the undulations of an uneven surface, skimming off the peaks, gradually creating a flat surface. In thicknessing or preparing rough stock, the jointer <b>plane</b> is usually preceded by the fore <b>plane</b> or jack <b>plane</b> and followed by the smoothing <b>plane.</b>|$|R

5|$|At dawn on September 5 the North Koreans attacked. The {{engineers}} repulsed {{this attack}} but suffered some casualties. Ammunition was running low and three US C-47 Skytrain aircraft {{came over the}} area to make an airdrop. The <b>planes</b> mistakenly dropped their bundles of ammunition and food on the North Korean positions. Immediately after the airdrops, two F-51 Mustang fighter <b>planes</b> came over and attacked D Company, also in error. Soon after this aerial attack, North Korean troops attacked the positions.|$|E
5|$|Before Ginger struck North Carolina, the American Red Cross set up 28emergency shelters in six counties, {{where about}} 5,500people stayed during the storm. The National Hurricane Center issued a {{hurricane}} watch from Wilmington, North Carolina, to Virginia Beach, Virginia, with gale warnings extending northward to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. United States military officials evacuated <b>planes</b> and ships from the Norfolk, Virginia, region, {{in addition to}} flying <b>planes</b> down the coast to warn boaters of the approaching storm. Ferry services around the Outer Banks were canceled during the storm's passage, while the Coast Guard ordered the evacuation of workers in three lighthouses.|$|E

50|$|A {{rotation}} {{with only}} one <b>plane</b> of rotation is a simple rotation. In a simple rotation there is a fixed <b>plane,</b> and rotation {{can be said to}} take place about this <b>plane,</b> so points as they rotate do not change their distance from this <b>plane.</b> The <b>plane</b> of rotation is orthogonal to this <b>plane,</b> and the rotation can be said to take place in this <b>plane.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Even {{though the}} input {{transparency}} only occupies a finite {{portion of the}} x-y <b>plane</b> (<b>Plane</b> 1), the uniform <b>plane</b> waves comprising the <b>plane</b> wave spectrum occupy the entire x-y <b>plane,</b> which is why (for this purpose) only the longitudinal <b>plane</b> wave phase (in the z-direction, from <b>Plane</b> 1 to <b>Plane</b> 2) must be considered, and not the phase transverse to the z-direction. It is of course, very tempting {{to think that if}} a <b>plane</b> wave emanating from the finite aperture of the transparency is tilted too far from horizontal, it will somehow [...] "miss" [...] the lens altogether but again, since the uniform <b>plane</b> wave extends infinitely far in all directions in the transverse (x-y) <b>plane,</b> the planar wave components cannot miss the lens.|$|R

5|$|Flight Unlimited III is a {{three-dimensional}} (3D) flight simulator video game, {{in which the}} player pilots virtual reproductions of real-world <b>planes.</b> Players may control ten aircraft: the Lake Turbo Renegade, Stemme S10, Mooney Bravo, Fokker Dr.I, Beechjet 400A and five <b>planes</b> first included in Flight Unlimited II. Plane cockpits feature simulated flight instruments such as variometers and primary flight displays, and allow for both visual and instrument navigation. The main airspace is 10,000 square miles of Seattle terrain; eight other Western American states are modeled as well, albeit in less detail. The California scenery from Flight Unlimited II may be imported to expand the airspace. The player shares the game's skies with artificially intelligent (AI) <b>planes.</b> Real-time, interactive air traffic control monitors the player's actions and tries to prevent mid-air collisions. Before a flight, the player may select which types of weather to encounter. Weather conditions such as cold fronts and thunderstorms develop in real-time.|$|E
50|$|In geometry, a Moufang <b>plane,</b> {{named for}} Ruth Moufang, {{is a type}} of {{projective}} <b>plane,</b> more specifically it is a special type of translation <b>plane.</b> A translation <b>plane</b> is a projective <b>plane</b> that has a translation line, that is, a line with the property that the group of automorphisms that fixes every point of the line acts transitively on the points of the <b>plane</b> not on the line. A translation <b>plane</b> is Moufang if every line of the <b>plane</b> is a translation line.|$|R
