40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) as an infectious agent for humans {{has increased in}} recent years in Germany. Although {{it is well known that}} the prevalence of MRSA in pig farms is high, risk factors for the presence of MRSA in <b>herds</b> of fattening <b>pigs</b> are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate available data from previous studies on MRSA in fattening pigs in a meta-analysis to answer the question: What are the factors associated with the occurrence of MRSA in fattening pig herds?The studies on MRSA in pigs that were identified by literature research were heterogeneous with respect to the risk factors investigated and the type of herds focused on. Therefore we decided to carry out a pooling analysis on herd level rather than a typical meta-analysis. Eligible herd data were identified based on the published literature and communication with the authors. The final data set covered 400 fattening <b>pig</b> <b>herds</b> from 10 different studies and 12 risk factors. The prevalence of MRSA in the 400 fattening <b>pig</b> <b>herds</b> was 53. 5 %. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE). The resulting multivariate model confirmed previously identified risk factors for MRSA in <b>pig</b> <b>herds</b> (herd size and herd type). It also identified further risk factors: group treatment of fattening pigs with antimicrobial drugs (OR= 1. 79) and housing fattening <b>pig</b> <b>herds</b> on at least partially slatted floors (OR= 2. 39) compared to plain floor. In contrast, according to the model, fattening <b>pig</b> <b>herds</b> on farms keeping other livestock along with pigs were less likely to harbor MRSA (OR= 0. 54).

S. breeding herds was estimated at $ 302. 06 million, i. e., $ 52. 19 per breeding female or $ 2. 36 per pig weaned. The majority of the loss in the breeding herd was due to reduced revenue ($ 300. 4 million) resulting from weaning 8. 3 million fewer pigs. Combining the losses in the breeding and growing pig herds resulted in 9. 9 million fewer pigs, or 2. 41 billion fewer pounds of pork (carcass weight), sold {{per year in the}} U. S. The estimated annual loss in the growing <b>pig</b> <b>herd</b> was $ 361. 8 million or $ 62. 52 per breeding female. As in the breeding herd, lost revenue of $ 1. 62 billion, rather than increased cost, was the primary source of losses attributed to PRRS. With PRRS, costs were lowered by $ 1. 25 billion because fewer pigs and pounds of pork were produced, thereby partially offsetting the lost revenue. In summary, the estimated total cost of PRRS in the U. S. national breeding and growing <b>pig</b> <b>herd</b> was at $ 664 million annually ($ 1. 8 million per day). In addition, information on veterinary costs, biosecurity costs, and other costs from the survey of expert opinion were used to estimate these annual costs attributed to PRRS virus.

40|$|The {{problems}} addressed are: (1) {{comparison of}} prevalences of Salmonella spp. in different herd {{types in the}} Danish pig population after implementation of the Danish Salmonella Control Program (DSCP), and (2) to make {{a reference to a}} study from 1993 / 1994 (pre-implementation) with a discussion of possible biases when diagnostic methods differ slightly.

Further, to discuss how herd prevalences may be compared to a previous study.

In these sub-clinically infected <b>pig</b> <b>herds,</b> an infectioncontamination-infection cycle is maintained with mainly an endemic 2 ̆ 2 house flora 2 ̆ 2 of Salmonella enterica (5). When contaminated batches from these farms are processed on the slaughter line, slaughtering practices contribute to Salmonella dissemination and carcass contamination.
