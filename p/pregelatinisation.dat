The sago starch was pregelatinised at 65 °C with four different heating times followed by oven drying. The pregelatinised sago starches (PS) were evaluated as directly compressible materials including their properties at molecular, particle and powder level {{in addition to their}} functional properties in directly compressible Paracetamol tablet formulations. Analysis of FT-IR and 13 CNMR spectra revealed that <b>pregelatinisation</b> did not alter the chemical structure of sago starch. XR-D patterns of sago starch showed characteristics of C-type while PS exhibited A-type, as the degree of crystallinity decreased with increasing heating time. DSC curves showed <b>pregelatinisation</b> increased gelatinisation temperature (To), peak temperature (Tp), and degree of gelatinisation (DG), narrowed gelatinisation temperature range (Tc – To) and decreased the melting enthalpy (ΔH) of sago starch, becoming more pronounced with increased heating time. SEM observations showed more sago starch granules lost their surface smoothness and more irregular shapes appeared as the heating time increased. PS showed higher swelling power (SP) at ≤ 55 ˚C and water solubility index (WSI) at ≤ 65 ˚C than sago starch. Longer heating time produced PS with lower amylosa content, higher viscosity, SP and WSI. Powder flow evaluations and powder compacts analysis by Heckel and Kawakita equations, mechanical properties and lubricant sensitivity revealed <b>pregelatinisation</b> improved flowability, compressibility, compactibility and lubricant sensitivity of sago starch, with the order PS 4 >PS 3 >PS 2 >PS 1 >sago starch. PS 4 flowability, compressibility and compactibility was comparable to Spress® B 820 but showed lower lubricant sensitivity. Compared to Avicel PH 101, PS 4 flowability was superior but its compressibility, compactibility and lubricant sensitivity were inferior. Based on the findings, PS 4 was the best candidate for directly compressible excipient iv among PS. Evaluation on the loading capacities for Avicel PH 101, PS 4 and Spress® B 820 relative to poorly compressible Paracetamol reached up to 70. 16...|$|E
