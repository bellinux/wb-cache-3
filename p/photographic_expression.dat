50|$|Although John Bulmer had pioneered colour {{documentary}} photography of Britain, from 1965, Gerry Badger {{has said}} of The Last Resort:It is difficult from a perspective of {{almost a quarter}} of a century to underestimate sic the significance of The Last Resort, either in British photography or Martin Parr's career. For both, it represented a seismic change in the basic mode of <b>photographic</b> <b>expression,</b> from monochrome to colour, a fundamental technical change that heralded the development of a new tone in documentary photography.|$|E
50|$|The Neues Sehen, {{also known}} as New Vision or Neue Optik, was a movement, not {{specifically}} restricted to photography, which {{was developed in the}} 1920s. The movement was directly related to the principles of the Bauhaus. Neues Sehen considered photography to be an autonomous artistic practice with its own laws of composition and lighting, through which the lens of the camera becomes a second eye for looking at the world. This new way of seeing was based on the use of unexpected framings, the search for contrast in form and light, the use of high and low camera angles, etc. The movement was contemporary with New Objectivity with which it shared a defence of photography as a specific medium of artistic expression, although Neues Sehen favoured experimentation and the use of technical means in <b>photographic</b> <b>expression.</b>|$|E
40|$|This master thesis has {{its origin}} in the {{possibilities}} that lays in surreal <b>photographic</b> <b>expressions,</b> and the gap which occurs within the understanding of what surreal photography is about, when art theory meets practice. The thesis has the difference between professional knowledge and common believes as focus, together with the relation between surrealistic art history and contemporary surrealistic photography practice. In this meeting between historical photo surrealism and contemporary understandings, I suggest didactic implications related to the justification questions in the academic field. These factors are combined in the following research question: How to use studies of surrealistic photography to enlighten the justification questions in the academic field related to visual literacy? To answer this question, I have used semiological methods for analyzing the conceptual understanding of the surrealistic term, and for analyzing photographs that are representative for key styles in historical surrealism. For the conceptual analyzes, I have used Roland Barthes’ poststructural semiological system of myth for the creating of meta-signs and metalanguages. For analyzing photographs, I have used Barthes semiological methods of denotations and connotations, together with Charles Sanders Peirce’s use of the meta-sign as an indexical sign. From the connotations I have identified some common similarities which I have {{used to evaluate the}} relation contemporary photographs to historical surrealism and surrealistic ideology. These contemporary photographs are either presented by photographers or publishing houses as surrealistic, or they are photographs that I by myself consider having surrealistic features. Finally, I have put my experiences from this thesis into a didactic view and connected these experiences to visual literacy and the justification questions in the academic field. Here I discuss factors which inflect visual literacy, such as where the professional area of responsibility starts and where it ends, and the dualistic relationship between the teacher’s role in teaching and the teacher’s role in his own learning...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} looks at {{preferential}} processing of <b>photographic</b> emotional <b>expression</b> stimuli and sex of poser via detection and identification tasks. A series of computer-based visual tasks were under taken to look further into current literature patterns of results {{and compare the}} differences of closed-mouth and open-mouth stimuli. Experiment 1 examined detection and identification of closed-mouth stimuli for happy, sad, angry and disgust emotional face expressions. Results indicated happy emotional expressions were preferentially detected compared to sad, angry and disgust emotional expressions. For the identification task happy {{and to a lesser}} extent sad emotional expressions were preferentially identified compared to sad, angry and disgust emotional expressions. Happy and sad emotional expressions were preferentially identified in the female poser condition compared the male poser condition. Experiment 2 repeated experiment 1 utilizing open-mouth stimuli. No significant differences resulted for the detection task. For the identification task happy emotional expressions were preferentially processed compared with sad, angry and disgust emotional expressions with disgust resulting in slower reaction times than angry emotional expressions and more errors than sad and angry emotional expressions. Preferential identification of sad emotional expressions were observed for the female poser condition and angry for the male poser condition. A follow-up task comparing the results of experiment 1 and 2 revealed no differences in between experiments for the detection task. The follow-up for the identification task comparison revealed faster identification of open-mouth stimuli for happy and angry emotional expressions compared to closed-mouth stimuli with fewer errors for angry and sad emotional expressions. The current thesis results suggest partial support for preferential processing differences between the emotional expressions due to closed-mouth and open-mouth regions of the face. Limitations of the current study and future directions are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Combining fictional scenes - {{written by}} over thirty {{different}} writers - set among actual protests with documentary footage of people Joe meets along the way, the film weaves together a seamless narrative. In a uniquely interactive writing process, each day new scenes were written and appropriated to upcoming events {{and in response}} to the previous day's footage. It is often impossible {{to tell the difference between}} fiction and reality. The concept is loosely inspired by Medium Cool by Haskell Wexler. The film was shot by cinematographer Christian Ditlev Bruun and Heather Greer on two main cameras at 24 frames/second, as well as several other video formats for b-roll. The film was unconventionally color corrected and composited using several different types of software as well as in-camera adjustments creating a unique, <b>photographic</b> <b>expression.</b> Motion graphics, titles, and color grading as well as the official poster and website was designed by Christian D. Bruun.|$|E

50|$|Ben-Yusuf's {{work was}} the subject of an exhibition, Zaida Ben-Yusuf: New York Portrait Photographer at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, which ran from 11 April through 1 September 2008. The curator, Frank H. Goodyear III, first learned about Ben-Yusuf when he {{discovered}} two of her photographs in 2003, depicting Daniel Chester French and Everett Shinn, and set forth to discover more about a photographer who had almost completely been forgotten. Goodyear suggested that gender discrimination might have led to Ben-Yusuf being forgotten, despite her significant contributions towards developing photography as a medium of artistic <b>expression.</b> <b>Photographic</b> history had tended to focus on male photographers such as Stieglitz, and less so on the female photographers, even though {{it was one of the}} few occupations considered a respectable career for a single woman in late 19th and early 20th century New York. Even in relatively progressive New York, where innovators in the arts, science, journalism and politics gathered, it was difficult for a single professional woman to support herself. Another reason for Ben-Yusuf's obscurity was that she had not bequeathed a significant archive of her work to a single institution, making it difficult to pull together enough examples to give her career the appropriate historical assessment. Goodyear's exhibition at the Smithsonian acted as a showcase for Ben-Yusuf's work, re-establishing her as a key figure in fine art photographic history.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to look at how the figure is imaged through the {{photographic}} medium today. Through this purpose I aim to explore the individual expression of the photographer in his <b>photographic</b> medium; the <b>expression</b> of the figure within the medium and the diverse practises of this medium in society - to build up an awareness and understanding of the diverse representations of the human form. The general aims of study are: 1 - to study how these three photographers choose to photograph the figure, through their technical, compositional and individual approach. 2 - to show how diverse the usage of the photographic figure is in the visual world. 3 - to expose an awareness of the photographic figure as transformation of an expression of self. 4 - to show the relationship between the photographer and the figure, the camera and the photographer, the camera and the figure, and the photographic figure and the viewer. 5 - to study my own photographic imagery in relation to the other imagery discussed. My research information was collected through: observations, discussions, literature and practical exploration. This study will attempt to draw conclusions, from its explorations, that will highlight the importance of the individual eye: that it is the individual eye that becomes the vehicle of transformation. ...|$|R

40|$|The Bachelor Thesis {{deals with}} the long {{exposure}} principle {{as a way of}} <b>photographic</b> <b>expression.</b> The thesis partly researches the technical dimension of the exposure time´s historical development in the context of its shortening. Differing from the past as the authors treated the long exposure as a negative effect and were trying to prevent from it, in the modern photography the principle is fully accepted as a creative instrument. The thesis core researches various approaches to the long photographic exposure in terms of authors and their work, created using those methods. In the Thesis we treat the long exposure as a creative way to get the required atmosphere into the picture, mainly to subdue or strengthen its inner dynamics. The paper looks over the long exposure as the ability to record the time flow and the transformation prcinciple, the way to change the object´s perception - from the action to the scene or from the crowd to the individual. Finally, the Thesis {{deals with the}} long exposure as an expression method of self-portrait...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Seven {{methods for}} {{delineating}} flood plains were evaluated. The methods are classified : (1) Geomorphic Technique; (2) Soils Technique; (3) Botanical Technique; (4) Hydrologic Technique; (5) Hydrologic- Hydraulic Technique; (6) Historical Technique; and (7) "Combination Method". All of the methods, except the Botanical Technique and the Hydrologic-Hydraulic Technique, were compared on sample flood plain reaches throughout Oregon. Chronological sequences of natural flood plains {{were identified and}} mapped based on: (1) scarps separating two or more flood plain or terrace geomorphic surfaces and (2) the abundance and degree of <b>photographic</b> <b>expression</b> of flood plain features such as meander scrolls, point bars, oxbows, oxbow lakes, sloughs, old channels, natural levees, and sand splays. Soils were useful in delineating flood plain areas since soils cannot be older than the alluvium in which they form or older than the associated geomorphic surface. Since soils exhibit increasing development of genetic horizons with increasing age, delineation of younger bottomland soils from older soils on higher flood plains or terraces, usually results in the delineation of flood prone areas. Since floods scar bark, or prune branches or the tops of trees, botanical studies can provide information about the flood date, flood stage, and area flooded. The number of annual tree rings that have grown since scarring of the bark, or the age of sprouts that have grown since flood damage occurred, are equal {{to the number of}} growing seasons since the trees were damaged. The thickness of sediment above the base of a tree serves as a measure of the rate of sediment accumulation above the surface on which the tree was located. Historically flood plains have been recognized and delineated by (1) aerial or ground photographs taken during floods; (2) high flood marks such as float debris; and (3) locating flooded areas from field interviews. Previous hydrologic studies have related the stage of rivers at gage locations to the adjacent flood plain areas, and in this manner flood plains have been recognized and delineated. In addition, hydraulic studies have been used to determine flood stages at valley cross sections, for specific flood frequencies. Flood plain width therefore may be determined from the valley cross sections. Use of both the gaging stations and the valley cross sections results in a hydrologic-hydraulic procedure for flood plain identification. The particular flood plain mapping technique that is most applicable in any given study depends on the data available, the purpose and scale of mapping, and the field conditions. Each technique has deficiencies; therefore, the "Combination Method" is introduced to utilize the most useful information from each technique. Collective use of two or more techniques is called the "Combination Method". The relative accuracy of the Geomorphic Technique, Soils Technique, Historical Technique, Hydrologic Technique, and "Combination Method" was determined for some representative stream reaches in Oregon. Areas flooded in a 100 year average recurrence interval event were compared for all methods available in 10 study areas, which ranged from semiarid to humid environments. For the areas compared the "Combination Method" was used as the base method. The Geomorphic Technique was the method most consistently comparable with the "Combination Method". The Soils Technique was generally accurate for delimiting flood plains, with some studies showing excellent correlation. The three study areas with comparisons using the Historic Technique were generally good and most discrepancies occurred where approximate historical flood lines were drawn for inaccessible areas. The Hydrologic Technique showed by fax the poorest correlation with the "Combination Method" as well as with all other methods. The differences between the "Combination Method" and the Hydrologic Technique are explained for specific maps, but in general the major problem was the lack of field correlation of crest staff gage flood elevations, with the general flood plain area away from the river. No independent evaluations were made of the Hydraulic Technique, although the Hydrologic-Hydraulic Technique was included as part of the "Combination Method" in one study...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} whether {{children with}} severe behavioural problems lack emotional competence in key areas and, if so, {{whether this is}} reflected {{in their ability to}} appraise emotions in others. Self-rated and objectively rated emotional competence of children in mainstream schooling was compared with 20 children aged seven to 11 excluded for severe social, emotional and behavioural difficulties. In Study 1 self-report questionnaires measured affect perception, empathy and expressivity in typically developing (N= 203), special educational needs (N= 36) and socially, emotionally and behaviourally disordered (N= 30) children in mainstream schooling. Younger children were less perceptive of affect than older children and scored lower for cognitive empathy. Boys scored lower in cognitive and affective empathy than girls and were less intimate, and more covert, in their expression of emotion. Special educational needs children appeared less emotionally perceptive than their peers. In Studies 2 a and 2 b, affect appraisal and the ability to describe emotional change were examined using a new measure employing pictorial representations of children in ambiguous postures and facial representations of emotion. Typical patterns of appraisal of possibly threatening, depressive and innocuous postures were established (N= 242). A developmental progression in reasons given for emotional change was seen with older children providing more socially based and mentalising answers than younger children. Study 3 developed an interactive computerised measure to examine the point at which children recognise the emergence of emotion from an interpolation of <b>photographic</b> facial <b>expressions.</b> Eighty-five typically developing children manipulated 26 emotional changes, including emotion/emotion and emotion/neutral transitions and chose a point of uncertainty in the transformation. A significant effect was found for facial representations of fear and anger, indicating a threat detection mechanism in response to emergent emotion. In Study 4 children with severe behavioural problems were compared across all measures with typically developing children from the first three studies. Behaviourally challenged children were deficient in cognitive and affective empathy and exhibited a hostile appraisal bias when assessing ambiguous postures of other children. No deficit was found in the ability to evaluate emotional change and provide age-appropriate reasons. However, anger was dominant in the perception even over fear stimuli when assessing emotional transition. Overall, children excluded from mainstream schooling with severe behavioural problems showed a very different profile to mainstream children with behavioural problems, suggesting a qualitative difference in cognitive functioning that could have a predictive function. This thesis not only supports the premise that severe SEBD children exhibit altered emotional functioning but has developed a series of tests that will have ongoing value in applied research...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to examine what happens when three-year-olds are given access to digital cameras, and what shape and form children’s {{photographic}} capacity takes {{within the framework of}} everyday pre-school activities. The notion that young children in pre-school rarely get to use cameras themselves, and that they take part in photographs produced by pre-school educators as part of an ongoing documenting practice rooted in the curriculum is the point of departure. The study has been conducted through an ethnographic approach further strengthened by post-qualitative thinking, where the research material was produced together with children in two different pre-schools. This material includes the children’s intra-actions with the cameras as well as the photographs that emerge {{during the course of the}} study. The thesis moves within a posthumanist theoretical framework, with a special focus on new materialism and agential realism, where humans and non-humans are seen as mutual performative agents. The theoretical perspective permeates the entire study, and does not, therefore, only serve as a support for analyses. Through diffractive readings, the results show that children and cameras approach pre-school and its visual events in a manner that is not recognisable in previous experiences of how pre-school and the life of children have formerly been made visible. In this study, the children use the cameras to create resistances and to look back at the educators, as well as to show what relations come into being with materials, peers, places, spaces and knowledge formation. The children, together with the cameras, also make visible the power of the eye to direct and display, where the cameras also come to be an aesthetic tool with the capacity to both see and make visible in everyday life. This, in turn, also brings to light aspects of ethics and leads to the breaking up of more traditional and normative <b>photographic</b> actions and <b>expressions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Faces provide {{information}} critical for effective social interactions. A face {{can be used}} to determine who someone is, where they are looking and how they are feeling. How these different aspects of a face are processed has proved a popular topic of research over the last 25 years. However, much of this research has focused on the perception of facial identity and as a result less is known about how facial expression is represented in the brain. For this reason, the primary aim of this thesis was to explore the neural representation of facial expression. First, this thesis investigated which regions of the brain are sensitive to expression and how these regions represent facial expression. Two regions of the brain, the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and the amygdala, were more sensitive to changes in facial expression than identity. There was, however, a dissociation between how these regions represented information about facial expression. The pSTS was sensitive to any change in facial expression, consistent with a continuous representation of expression. In comparison, the amygdala was only sensitive to changes in expression that resulted in a change in the emotion category. This reflects a more categorical response in which expressions are assigned into discrete categories of emotion. Next, the representation of expression was further explored by asking what information from a face is used in the perception of <b>expression.</b> <b>Photographic</b> negation was used to disrupt the surface-based facial cues (i. e. pattern of light and dark across the face) while preserving the shape-based information carried by the features of the face. This manipulation had a minimal effect on judgements of expression, highlighting the important role of the shape-based information in judgements of expression. Furthermore, combining the photo negation technique with fMRI demonstrated that the representation of faces in the pSTS was predominately based on feature shape information. Finally, the influence of facial identity on the neural representation of facial expression was measured. The pSTS, but not the amygdala, was most responsive to changes in facial expression when the identity of the face remained the same. It was found that this sensitivity to facial identity in the pSTS was a result of interactions with regions thought {{to be involved in the}} processing of facial identity. In this way identity information {{can be used to}} process expression in a socially meaningful way. ...|$|R
