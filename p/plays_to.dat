5|$|Shortly {{after the}} fourth quarter began, the Virginia Tech drive {{that began in the}} waning moments of the third quarter came to an end. The Hokies were forced to punt, and Louisville began its first drive of {{the fourth quarter}}. The Cardinals' Harry Douglas ran for 29yards on their first play of the drive. On the second, Hunter Cantwell {{completed}} a 29-yard touchdown pass to Gary Barnidge. It took Louisville just 33seconds and two <b>plays</b> <b>to</b> travel 58yards and earn a touchdown. The score gave Louisville a 24–13 lead with 13:32 remaining to play. But just as it took Louisville just two <b>plays</b> <b>to</b> score, so too did it take Virginia Tech two <b>plays</b> <b>to</b> answer the Louisville touchdown. After taking over at his team's 22-yard line, Marcus Vick completed a 54-yard pass to wide receiver David Clowney. Virginia Tech and Louisville committed offsetting 15-yard personal foul penalties before the play, to no effect on the Hokie offense. On the next play after the long pass, Cedric Humes rushed for 24yards and the answering Hokie touchdown. It took just 28seconds for Virginia Tech to answer the Louisville touchdown. Having done that, Tech went Louisville one better, successfully scoring a two-point conversion on a pass from Vick to Morgan. The touchdown and two-point conversion cut the Louisville lead to 24–21.|$|E

5|$|Before the Rose Bowl, Shaughnessy lent help {{to his old}} {{associate}} George Halas of the Chicago Bears, {{which in}} Sid Luckman, had found a quarterback well suited to the T formation. Before the NFL Championship Game against the Washington Redskins, Shaughnessy devised a series of counter <b>plays</b> <b>to</b> confuse their opponent, which on game film had shown a tendency to shift linebackers {{in the direction of}} the motion man. His preparations helped Chicago rout Washington, 73–0.|$|E
5|$|Characters of Shakespear's Plays is an 1817 book of {{criticism}} of Shakespeare's plays, written by early nineteenth century English essayist and literary critic William Hazlitt. Composed {{in reaction to the}} neoclassical approach to Shakespeare's plays typified by Samuel Johnson, it was among the first English-language studies of Shakespeare's <b>plays</b> <b>to</b> follow the manner of German critic August Wilhelm Schlegel, and, with the work of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, {{paved the way for the}} increased appreciation of Shakespeare's genius that was characteristic of later nineteenth-century criticism. It was also the first book to cover all of Shakespeare's plays, intended as a guide for the general reader.|$|E
5|$|During {{his nine}} years at Massillon, Brown invented the playbook, a {{detailed}} listing of formations and set plays, and tested his players on {{their knowledge of}} it. He also originated the practice of sending in <b>plays</b> <b>to</b> his quarterback from the sideline using hand signals. His overall record at the school was 80–8–2, including a 35-game winning streak. Between 1935 and 1940, the team won the state football championship six times and won the High School Football National Championship four times, outscoring opponents by 2,393 points to 168 over that span. After the early losses to Canton, the Tigers beat the Bulldogs six straight times.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th and 20th century, Romeo and Juliet {{has often}} been the choice of Shakespeare <b>plays</b> <b>to</b> open a {{classical}} theatre company, beginning with Edwin Booth's inaugural production of that play in his theatre in 1869, the newly re-formed company of the Old Vic in 1929 with John Gielgud, Martita Hunt, and Margaret Webster, {{as well as the}} Riverside Shakespeare Company in its founding production in New York City in 1977, which used the 1968 film of Franco Zeffirelli's production as its inspiration.|$|E
5|$|In {{this volume}} Kierkegaard {{examines}} {{the concept of}} 'First Love' as a pinnacle for the aestheticist, using his idiosyncratic concepts of 'closedness' (indesluttethed in Danish) and the 'demonic' (demoniske) with reference to Eugène Scribe. Scribe {{wanted to create a}} template for all playwrights to follow. He insisted that people go to <b>plays</b> <b>to</b> escape from reality and not for instruction. Kierkegaard is against any template in the field of literature or of Christianity. He was against systematizing anything in literature because the system brings the artist to a stop and he or she just settles down in the system.|$|E
5|$|Louisville's {{second drive}} {{of the game}} was much quicker than the Cardinals' first. After {{beginning}} at their own 20-yard line, it took the Cardinals just seven <b>plays</b> <b>to</b> travel 80yards and earn a touchdown. Louisville was helped throughout the drive by repeated Virginia Tech personal foul penalties. Tech players committed three separate 15-yard personal fouls during the drive, one of which came after Louisville's successful extra point kick when cornerback Jimmy Williams bumped a game official. Williams was ejected from the game for the contact and {{was removed from the}} field after watching the next series from the sidelines. The touchdown and extra point extended Louisville's first-quarter lead to 14–3.|$|E

5|$|Miami {{began the}} second quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a first down at the Virginia Tech 30-yard line. From there, it took Miami just four <b>plays</b> <b>to</b> score. Roan ran for seven yards, Kelly completed an 11-yard pass, threw an incomplete pass, then Hobbs ran 12 yards for the touchdown. The score and following extra point gave Miami a 140 lead with 13:47 remaining before halftime.|$|E
5|$|Reading and how reading defines {{characters}} is a focus within many {{plays and}} in Fielding's later works. In Love in Several Masques, the character Wisemore focuses on classics but ignores contemporary society. Similarly, the character Wilding, in The Temple Beau, practices law but doesn't read at all. Reading is an outlet to understanding humanity, and Fielding uses his <b>plays</b> <b>to</b> inform an audience how {{to better understand}} humanity.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 16-yard line, and Casey completed a quick 14-yard pass to Purdham for a first down. But Tech was unable to gain another first down, and after four plays were stopped short, Tech turned the ball over to Miami after Casey threw an incomplete pass on fourth down. Miami {{received the}} ball with 1:24 remaining and ran a series of inconsequential <b>plays</b> <b>to</b> draw down the clock and bring the game to an end. Miami earned the win, 2010.|$|E

5|$|The Broncos' {{first drive}} {{of the second}} quarter was halted after a holding penalty and an {{incomplete}} pass denied BSU {{a chance for a}} first down. Boise was forced to kick the ball away once more. The Pirates' second drive of the quarter began at their 26–yard line. ECU needed just four <b>plays</b> <b>to</b> march 74yards down the field for a touchdown. On the drive, Chris Johnson rushed for 46yards and threw an 18–yard pass for a touchdown. After the touchdown and the extra point kick, ECU led 24–7.|$|E
5|$|The Noh play , one of {{the only}} Noh <b>plays</b> <b>to</b> feature a prop of any {{significant}} size, is based on a legend concerning the bell of Dōjō-ji.

5|$|When Fielding {{returned}} {{to working with}} the Royal Theatre, his piece The Lottery became an immediate success and lasted for decades after. Combined with The Modern Husband, Fielding could have received up to 1,000 pounds from the plays' first run. This placed Fielding at the position of being the main contributor of <b>plays</b> <b>to</b> the Royal Theatre. Currently, Fielding is primarily viewed as a novelist, but his plays suggest that he wished to be a playwright and that his career would be in theatre. Although Fielding wrote twenty-six plays, {{only a handful of}} them were ever published in critical editions before 1990.|$|E

5|$|With the {{momentum}} shifting in the Golden Bears' favor {{and a chance}} to take the lead, it took California three <b>plays</b> <b>to</b> earn a touchdown from its 34-yard line. Rodgers completed a 42-yard pass, then a 14-yard pass, and Adimchinobe Echemandu ran the ball in to the end zone from the Virginia Tech 10-yard line. The score gave California its first lead since the first drive of the game, and with 5:52remaining in the quarter, the scoreboard read 35–28, California.

5|$|After the Virginia Tech kickoff {{and a short}} return, Miami {{began the}} first drive of the game at its 32-yard line. The game's first play was an {{incomplete}} pass from Miami quarterback Jim Kelly. After a one-yard rush, Kelly completed his first pass of the game, an 18-yard toss that drove Miami to the Tech 49-yard line and gave the Hurricanes a first down. Miami then committed a 15-yard penalty, pushing the Hurricanes back into {{their side of the}} field. On the second play after the penalty, Kelly completed a 29-yard pass that gave Miami a first down. The Hurricanes were further aided by a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty against Virginia Tech, giving Miami a first down at the Tech 20-yard line. From there, it took Miami just three <b>plays</b> <b>to</b> score a touchdown, the final play being a 15-yard pass from Kelly to Larry Brodsky. With 12:37 remaining in the quarter, Miami took a 70 lead.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} the post-score kickoff, then went three-and-out. Virginia Tech recovered the kick at its 35-yard line, {{and began a}} drive that needed only three <b>plays</b> <b>to</b> score a touchdown. The key effort was a 51-yard sprint by running back Darren Evans, which advanced {{the ball to the}} Florida State 9-yard line. The score and extra point pushed Tech's lead to 14–3 with 4:37 remaining. Florida State responded with a quick touchdown drive of its own. From its 32-yard line, the Seminoles needed only six plays, three of them passes from E. J. Manuel, to reach the end zone. The score with 1:52 remaining trimmed Tech's lead to 14–10 at the 1:52 mark. As the quarter came to an end, Virginia Tech {{received the}} post-score kickoff and advanced the ball to its 22-yard line before the final seconds ticked off the clock and the first quarter ended with Tech leading 14–10.|$|E
