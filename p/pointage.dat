50|$|Like {{many other}} {{miniature}} wargames, Warhammer 40,000 {{relies on a}} point-based system to ensure a balanced game between players. Players set a maximum amount of <b>pointage</b> that they will construct their armies with. No matter what faction a player uses, each unit has a corresponding point cost, with generally powerful units costing much more than standard soldiers. A typical game of Warhammer 40,000 ranges from 500 to a little over 2,000 points. The introduction of the Apocalypse sourcebook offered players a streamlined ruleset for playing games of well over 3,000 points. Apocalypse also allows {{for the use of}} allies, in order to help players to reach an Apocalypse size army.|$|E
30|$|The optimum {{levels of}} flowability, coating thickness, <b>pointage,</b> and {{temperature}} for painting process and total alkalinity, temperature, PH value of rinsing water, and timing for washing process were estimated.|$|E
30|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that the parameters <b>pointage</b> (painting) and timing (washing) significantly {{affect the quality of}} the shock absorber, which can be confirmed with the help of percent contribution.|$|E
30|$|The various process {{parameters}} {{affecting the}} quality {{characteristics of the}} shock absorber during the process were identified using the Ishikawa diagram and by failure mode and effect analysis. The identified process parameters are welding process parameters (squeeze, heat control, wheel speed, and air pressure), damper sealing process parameters (load, hydraulic pressure, air pressure, and fixture height), washing process parameters (total alkalinity, temperature, pH value of rinsing water, and timing), and painting process parameters (flowability, coating thickness, <b>pointage,</b> and temperature). In this paper, the process parameters, namely, painting and washing process parameters, are optimized by Taguchi method. Though the defects are reasonably minimized by Taguchi method, {{in order to achieve}} zero defects during the processes, genetic algorithm technique is applied on the optimized parameters obtained by Taguchi method.|$|E

NOUS PROPOSONS EGALEMENT D'INTEGRER AUX LANGAGES IMPERATIFS UNE STRUCTURE DE CONTROLE BASEE SUR UN FORMALISME DE MACHINES A ETATS HIERARCHIQUES POUR FACILITER LA PROGRAMMATION DE COMPORTEMENTS DYNAMIQUES ET FAIRE DES INTERACTIONS DES OBJETS A PART ENTIERE DU VOCABULAIRE DES PROGRAMMEURS. NOUS MONTRONS PAR DES EXEMPLES COMME CES ELEMENTS PERMETTENT LA REPRODUCTION DE L'ETAT DE L'ART DES INTERACTIONS, TANT STANDARDS QU'AVANCEES, ET LA MISE AU POINT DE TECHNIQUES D'INTERACTION ORIGINALES ET PERFORMANTES. NOUS PRESENTONS EN PARTICULIER LA REALISATION D'APPLICATIONS GRAPHIQUES INTERACTIVES UTILISANT UNE ARCHITECTURE DISTRIBUEE PERMETTANT DE LOCALISER L'INTERACTION SUR LE SYSTEME LOCAL ET DE REPORTER LE NOYAU FONCTIONNEL SUR UNE MACHINE DISTANTE.

THIS THESIS PRESENTS AN APPROACH AND A SET OF TOOLS THAT FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF ADVANCED INTERACTION TECHNIQUES IN INTERACTIVE GRAPHICAL APPLICATIONS. WE SOLVE THE CONTRADICTORY CONSTRAINTS OF REUSABILITY, REQUIRED FOR FACTORING, AND INNOVATION, REQUIRED FOR ADAPTING APPLICATIONS TO NEW CONTEXTS OF USE, BY PROVIDING A PYRAMID OF LEVELS OF ABSTRACTIONS THAT CAN BE COMBINED IN VARIOUS WAYS TO ADAPT TO THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF EACH APPLICATION. WE ALSO AUGMENT IMPERATIVE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES WITH A NEW CONTROL STRUCTURED BASED ON HIERARCHICAL STATE MACHINES. THIS FACILITATES THE PROGRAMMING OF DYNAMIC BEHAVIOURS BY TURNING INTERACTIONS INTO FIRST-CLASS OBJECTS OF THE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. THROUGH A SET OF EXAMPLES, WE DEMONSTRATE HOW THIS APPROACH SUPPORTS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BOTH CLASSICAL AND STATE-OF-THE-ART INTERACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NOVEL AND EFFICIENT INTERACTION TECHNIQUES. IN PARTICULAR, WE DESCRIBE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A DISTRIBUTED ARCHITECTURE FOR DEVELOPING INTERACTIVE GRAPHICAL APPLICATIONS WHERE ADVANCED INTERACTION AND RENDERING IS HANDLED ON THE LOCAL MACHINE WHILE THE FUNCTIONAL CORE RUNS ON A DISTANT MACHINE. WE ALSO DESCRIBE A NOVEL INTERACTION TECHNIQUE CALLED SEMANTIC POINTING THAT FACILITATES THE SELECTION OF OBJECTS WITH A POINTING DEVICE BY DECOUPLING THE VISUAL SIZE OF OBJECTS, DEFINED BY THEIR PRESENTATION REQUIREMENTS, FROM THEIR SIZE IN THE MOTOR SPACE, DEFINED BY THEIR INTERACTION REQUIREMENTS.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} safety and {{cosmetic}} efficacy of a new multiple noncontinuous transepithelial puncture technique for tattooing a decompensated cornea. METHODS: It was anon-comparative clinical case series study. The study examines 33 eyes in 33 patients with total corneal opacity due to corneal decompensation, which developed following intraocular surgery. Corneal tattooing was performed using the multiple noncontinuous transepithelial puncture technique (i. e. <b>pointage).</b> The safety of this new surgical strategy was assessed by occurrence of adverse events for the follow-up period. The cosmetic efficacy {{was determined by the}} patient’s cosmetic satisfaction and independent observer’s opinion about patient appearance. RESULTS: Seven women and 26 men were included in the study. The mean age was 46. 4 ± 17. 5 y (range: 7 - 67). In total, 30 of 33 patients (91 %) reported cosmetic satisfaction within the follow-up period. Only 3 patients (9 %) required additional tattooing due to cosmetic unsatisfaction. Cosmetic outcomes were analyzed and classified as excellent or good in 13 (39 %) and 17 (52 %) patients, respectively. No serious adverse events developed, except delayed epithelial healing in 3 cases. CONCLUSION: The cosmetic outcomes of the multiple noncontinuous transepithelial puncture technique for corneal tattooing were good. The safety of this method is higher than conventional procedures. This new procedure also provides improved cost-effectiveness and safety over current corneal tattooing techniques...|$|E
