5|$|Bouldering {{can damage}} {{vegetation}} that grows on rocks, such as mosses and lichens. This can {{occur as a}} result of the climber intentionally cleaning the boulder, or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds. Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse, particularly by climbers laying down crash pads. Soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails, or when they unearth small rocks near the boulder in an effort to make the landing zone safer. The repeated use of white climbing chalk can damage the rock surface of boulders and cliffs, particularly sandstone and other <b>porous</b> <b>rock</b> types, and the scrubbing of rocks to remove chalk can also degrade the rock surface. Other environmental concerns include littering, improperly disposed feces, and graffiti. These issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering, as was the case in Tea Garden, a popular bouldering area in Rocklands, South Africa.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{we use the}} X-ray CT {{images of}} Berea {{sandstones}} {{to carry out the}} numerical study of the effects of wave-induced fluid motion on seismic velocity and attenuation in <b>porous</b> <b>rocks.</b> In numerical modeling, it is possible to control the factors and inputs that are hard to accomplish in laboratory measurements and isolate those of interest that have significant impact on the seismic responses; this can help in understanding the fundamental physics of seismic waves propagating in saturated <b>porous</b> <b>rocks.</b> The ultimate goal of computational rock physics is to supplement the traditional laboratory measurements, that are time consuming and costly, with cheaper numerical experiments that allow the parameter space to be explored more thoroughly. For this purpose, in this thesis we develop a computational method for time domain simulation of wave propagation in poroelastic medium. The medium is composed of an elastic matrix saturated with a Newtonian fluid. The method operates on a digitized representation of the medium where a distinct material phase and properties are specified at each volume cell. The dynamic response to an acoustic excitation is modeled mathematically with a coupled system of equations: elastic wave equation in the solid matrix and linearized Navier-Stokes equation in the fluid. Implementation of the solution is simplified by introducing a common numerical form for both solid and fluid cells and using a rotated-staggered-grid finite-difference scheme which allows stable solutions without explicitly handling the fluid-solid boundary conditions. A stability analysis is incorporated and can be used to select gridding and time step size as a function of material properties. The numerical results are shown to agree with the analytical solution for an idealized porous medium of periodically alternating solid and fluid layers. When applying the linear solver to compute the effective elastic properties of 3 D digitized <b>porous</b> <b>rocks,</b> we find discrepancies between the numerical results and the laboratory measurements. The reason for such a problem is the loss of small features, such as cracks and micro-pores, in the digitized matrix of rocks during the imaging process of aggregation. A hybrid approach, combining the numerical computation 3 and the effective media theories, is developed to deduce the lost cracks from a limited number of laboratory measurements. This approach can recover the lost cracks and is capable of predicting the effective elastic properties of the rock matrix. Compared to the traditional inversion schemes based only on the effective media theories, this hybrid scheme has the advantage of utilizing the complex micro-structures of 3 D digitized <b>porous</b> <b>rocks</b> that are resolved in the imaging process, and it helps limit the inversion space for crack distribution. In the study of the dynamic and low-frequency responses of saturated <b>porous</b> <b>rocks,</b> we employ the stress-strain calculation in numerical modeling so as to compute the velocities and attenuations of rock samples, the sizes of which are much smaller than the seismic wavelength of interest. For these cases, transmission measurement cannot be used. Realizing the significant contribution of small cracks to the total attenuation, we extend the hybrid approach by incorporating the modified squirt-flow model where a fluid with frequency-dependent bulk modulus is introduced. Therefore, attenuation due to viscous fluid in stiff pores, that are resolved in the imaging process, can be computed numerically. Attenuation due to viscous fluid in compliant pores can be determined by the modified squirt-flow model since we know the crack distribution. In the inversion for crack distribution, besides using the velocities of P- and S-waves measured in laboratory for the dry and water-saturated cases, measured attenuation data of P-waves are also used so as to further constrain the inversion, and to improve the uniqueness of the inversion results. By using such an extended hybrid approach, we are able to predict both the velocities of saturated <b>porous</b> <b>rocks</b> and the attenuations. From numerical study with the linear solver, we can conclude that the linear solver is able to accurately couple elastic solid and viscous fluid and handle high material contrast and the complex micro-structures of 3 D digitized <b>porous</b> <b>rocks.</b> The stress-strain calculation is capable of computing the velocities and attenuations of saturated <b>porous</b> <b>rocks</b> the sizes of which are much smaller than the wavelength of interest. The hybrid approach is a practical way to study the seismic properties of saturated <b>porous</b> <b>rocks</b> until high enough resolution digitized data and enough computational resources are available. From the computations, we observe that the small features, such as cracks lost in the imaging process, are critical for accurately predicting velocities and attenuations of saturated <b>porous</b> <b>rocks.</b> Generally, attenuation is more sensitive to the viscosity of the saturating fluid than velocity is, and attenuation due to viscous fluid in compliant pores is greater than that due to viscous fluid in stiff pores. by Yang Zhang.

40|$|Underground rocks {{usually have}} complex pore {{system with a}} variety of pore types and a wide range of pore size. The effects of pore {{structure}} on elastic wave attenuation cannot be neglected. We investigated the pore structure effects on P-wave scattering attenuation in dry rocks by pore-scale modeling based on the wave theory and the similarity principle. Our modeling results indicate that pore size, pore shape (such as aspect ratio), and pore density are important factors influencing P-wave scattering attenuation in <b>porous</b> <b>rocks,</b> and can explain the variation of scattering attenuation at the same porosity. From the perspective of scattering attenuation, <b>porous</b> <b>rocks</b> can safely suit to the long wavelength assumption when the ratio of wavelength to pore size is larger than 15. Under the long wavelength condition, the scattering attenuation coefficient increases as a power function as the pore density increases, and it increases exponentially with the increase in aspect ratio. For a certain porosity, rocks with smaller aspect ratio and/or larger pore size have stronger scattering attenuation. When the pore aspect ratio is larger than 0. 5, the variation of scattering attenuation at the same porosity is dominantly caused by pore size and almost independent of the pore aspect ratio. These results lay a foundation for pore structure inversion from elastic wave responses in <b>porous</b> <b>rocks...</b>|$|R

There are several deep entrances through this reef, and inside it there is hood anchorage in all weathers. The land rises gradually to a moderate height, and numerous small streams descend on all sides. The mere existence of these streams would prove that the island was not entirely coralline, as in that case all the water would sink through the <b>porous</b> <b>rock</b> as it does at Manowolko and Matabello; but we have more positive proof in the pebbles and stones of their beds, which exhibit a variety of stratified crystalline rocks.

60|$|As {{examples}} of ordinary cases of fountains, {{we will take}} those represented in the following figures. Fig. I is a mountain. Fig. 2 is a model, made to explain more clearly the conditions represented in fig. I. It will be observed {{that there is a}} ravine, R, in front; a line of fault, L, M. N, on its left side, Supposed to be filled with water-tight rock; and a valley, V (fig. 1), on the extreme right. The upper part of the mountain is supposed to be much more porous than its base, and the plane which divides the porous from the non-porous rock, to cut the surface of the mountain along the line, A, N, M, B, C, D, E, F. The highest point of the plane is F, and the lowest point A. The effect of rain upon the model fig. 2 would be, to wet its upper half: water would ooze out along the whole of the lines A, N, and M, B, C, D, E, F; and there would be a small fountain at A, and a large one at M. But in the actual mountain, fig. 1, we should not expect to find the same regularity as in the model. The rind of the earth, with its vegetation and weather-impacted surface, forms a comparatively impermeable envelope to the mountain, not likely to be broken through, except at a few places. But ravines, such as r, would be probably denuded of their rind, and there we should find a line of minute fountains {{at the base of the}} <b>porous</b> <b>rock.</b> If there be no actual fountains, there would at least be some vegetation that indicated dripping water: thus the appearance is well known and often described, of a ravine utterly bare of verdure above, but clothed with vegetation below a sharply defined line, whence the moisture proceeds that irrigates all beneath. We should also be almost certain of finding a spring breaking forth near m or even near a. But in the valley V we should only see a few signs of former moisture, along e, f; such as bunches of vegetation upon the arid cliff, or an efflorescence of salts. Whenever a traveller remarks these signs, he should observe the inclination of the strata, by which he would learn the position of m, where the probability of finding water is the greatest.
