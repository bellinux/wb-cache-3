These differences point to different irregularity production mechanisms: energetic electron precipitation into dynamic auroral arcs versus cusp ionospheric convection dynamics. Observations suggest anisotropy of scintillation-causing irregularities with stronger L-shell alignment of irregularities in the cusp while a significant component of field-aligned irregularities is found in the nightside auroral oval. Scintillation-causing irregularities can coexist with small-scale field-aligned irregularities resulting in HF radar backscatter.

30|$|It is {{well known}} that {{small-scale}} electron density irregularities are frequently formed in the terrestrial ionosphere. At high latitudes, irregularities, which range in size from a few meters to a few tens of kilometers, often exhibit highly dynamic behavior when disturbed by solar wind and/or the magnetosphere (e.g., Tsunoda 1988). The consequent density perturbations sometimes induce significant fluctuations in the amplitude and phase of trans-ionospheric satellite transmission signals received on the ground, which are commonly called ionospheric amplitude and <b>phase</b> <b>scintillations</b> (Kintner et al. 2007). Amplitude scintillations are observed as random fluctuations of the signal strength, leading to periods of reduced signal strength for users of a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). <b>Phase</b> <b>scintillations</b> are detected as high frequency fluctuations in the GNSS carrier phase, which may result in a loss of phase lock due to significant stress on the carrier phase tracking process (Skone 2001; Garner et al. 2011).

In particular, <b>phase</b> <b>scintillation</b> significantly increased {{for a few minutes}} immediately after the onset of the expansion phase during which very bright discrete aurora forms covered the entire sky and moved very dynamically. It was thus likely that an ionization structure of a few to a few tens of kilometers in size moved across the GPS signal path, leading to significant changes in the refractive index and resulting in the enhancement of the <b>phase</b> <b>scintillation.</b> In order to confirm this hypothesis, we plan to extend this study through the use of 50  Hz GPS phase data, electron density measurements made by the European Incoherent SCATer (EISCAT) radar and high-time-resolution optical data in the future.

The auroral <b>phase</b> <b>scintillation</b> shows semiannual variation with equinoctial maxima known to be associated with auroras, while in the cusp and polar cap the scintillation occurrence is highest in the autumn and winter months and lowest in summer.

Out {{of a total of}} 480 scintillation events recorded during 2010, 84. 4 % were weak (0. 2 ≤ S 4 < 0. 3), 14. 6 % moderate (0. 3 ≤ S 4 < 0. 45) and only 1 % strong (0. 45 ≤ S 4). The amplitude scintillations were most pronounced in the local daytime with January registering the highest occurrence. Seasonal analysis revealed maximum scintillation occurrence during summer as compared to winter and equinox seasons. The daytime scintillation with a maximum in the summer is consistent with localized blanketing sporadic E observations and could also be possibly due to lightning activity around the observing station. Annual percentage occurrence shows that scintillations occurred mostly in the daytime with peak occurrence at around 05 : 00 – 09 : 00 LT. The daytime strong scintillation events were not associated with vTEC depletions and <b>phase</b> <b>scintillations,</b> but the signal to noise ratio during the scintillation events decreased with increase in scintillation index (S 4).

30|$|Ionospheric {{scintillation}} {{is one of}} {{the predominant}} propagation impairments at L-band frequencies that persist because of the existence of irregularities in the ionosphere due to refraction, reflection and scattering of the radio signals (e.g. De Paula et al. 2003; Iyer et al. 2006; Cherniak et al. 2014). When a radio wave passes through the ionosphere, the irregularities distort the wavefront and as the wave moves towards the ground, phase mixing occurs creating a diffraction pattern on the ground. This diffraction phenomenon was determined by the size and strength of the ionospheric irregularities (Yeh and Liu 1982). The diffraction mechanism gives rise to amplitude scintillations which occur mainly due to small-scale irregularities when phase variations are small. However, due to large scale irregularities, the phase fluctuations are dominant and the wave becomes non-coherent thereby focusing and defocusing of the rays is not possible (Wernik et al. 2004). As the interference mechanism is not valid under such conditions, amplitude scintillations do not increase further and <b>phase</b> <b>scintillations</b> become significant (Wernik et al. 2004). Amplitude and <b>phase</b> <b>scintillations</b> degrade the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver’s tracking performance (e.g. Kintner et al. 2007; Aquino and Sreeja 2013). In order to improve the positional accuracy and availability of GNSS receivers, several methods have been proposed to detect the ionospheric scintillations (e.g. Suman et al. 2004; Pullen et al. 2009). A real-time ionospheric scintillation model, which determines the automatic threshold for different scintillation signals using the Neyman–Pearson detector, has been implemented (Venkata Ratnam et al. 2015). Mushini et al. (2012) proposed a wavelet-based detrending technique for detrending GPS signals. Wavelet detrending technique reveals local features of the signals as compared to Butterworth detrended filter (Mushini et al. 2012). Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) methods {{have been found to be}} suitable for analysing non-stationary signals (Wang et al. 2012). Multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) has been successfully implemented in medical and geophysics applications to investigate the self similarities and long-range correlations in the signals (e.g. Kantelhardt et al. 2002; Tanna and Pathak 2014).|$|R
40|$|A short {{description}} is given of each ionospheric {{total electron content}} (TEC) effect upon radio waves, along with a representative value {{of the magnitude of}} each of these effects under normal ionospheric conditions. A discussion is given of the important characteristics of average ionospheric TEC behavior and the temporal and spatial variability of TEC. Radio waves undergo several effects when they pass through the Earth's ionosphere. One of {{the most important of these}} effects is a retardation, or group delay, on the modulation or information carried on the radio wave that is due to its encounter with the free, thermal electrons in the Earth's ionosphere. Other effects the ionosphere has on radio waves include: radio frequency (RF) carrier phase advance; Doppler shift of the RF carrier of the radio wave; Faraday rotation of the plane of polarization of linearly polarized waves; angular refraction or bending of the radio wave path as it travels through the ionosphere; and amplitude and <b>phase</b> <b>scintillations...</b>|$|R
