40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} highly {{integrated}} dual-side dual-output (DSDO) switched-capacitor (SC) converter {{with only two}} flying capacitors. Generally, a dual-phase voltage doubler and an inverter are used to supply positive and negative voltages for thin film transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) gate drivers, respectively. Four flying capacitors, eight <b>pin-outs</b> for the four flying capacitors, and 16 power switches are necessary for their operations in the driver integrated chip (IC). The proposed DSDO SC converter combines both dual-phase voltage doubler and inverter converter in one channel {{through the use of}} time multiplexing technique with minimal performance degradation. As a result, the proposed converter not only reduces the number of flying capacitors from four to two, but also removes four IC <b>pin-outs</b> for lower cost and more compact size. Moreover, the 16 required power switches are reduced to 12, resulting in an approximated 27 % decrease of the silicon area.

40|$|Field-programmable {{systems with}} {{multiple}} FPGAs on a PCB or an MCM {{are being used}} by system designers when a single FPGA is not sufficient. We {{address the problem of}} partitioning a large technology mapped FPGA circuit onto multiple FPGA devices of a specific target technology. The physical characteristics of the multiple FPGA system (MFS) pose additional constraints to the circuit partitioning algorithms: the capacity of each FPGA, the timing constraints, the number of I/Os per FPGA, and the pre-designed interconnection patterns of each FPGA and the package. Existing partitioning techniques which minimize just the cut sizes of partitions fail to satisfy the above challenges. We therefore present a timing driven N-way partitioning algorithm based on simulated annealing for technology-mapped FPGA circuits. The signal path delays are estimated during partitioning using a timing model specific to a multiple FPGA architecture. The model combines all possible delay factors in a system with multiple FPGA chips of a target technology. Furthermore, we have incorporated a new dynamic net-weighting scheme to minimize the number of <b>pin-outs</b> for each chip. Finally, we have developed a graph-based global router for pin assignment which can handle the pre-routed connections of our MFS structure. In order to reduce the time spent in the simulated annealing phase of the partitioner, clusters of circuit components are identified by a new linear-time bottom-up clustering algorithm. The annealing-based N-way partitioner executes four times faster using the clusters as opposed to a flat netlist with improved partitioning results. For several industrial circuits, our approach outperforms the recursive min-cut bi-partitioning algorithm by 35 % in terms of nets cut. Our approach also outperforms an industrial FPGA partitioner by 73 % on average in terms of unroutable nets. Using the performance optimization capabilities in our approach we have successfully partitioned the MCNC benchmarks satisfying the critical path constraints and achieving a significant reduction in the longest path delay. An average reduction of 17 % in the longest path delay was achieved at the cost of 5 % in total wire length...|$|R

The principal goal of the original program {{was to develop a}} data bus, optimized for high speed data acquisition, which would accommodate the anticipated needs of the 1980 's and beyond. The principal requirements perceived at the inception of FASTBUS were threefold: (1) To accommodate system data throughputs of about an order of magnitude greater than systems in current use; (2) To accommodate distributed intelligence, particularly in the form of multiple microprocessors and special purpose microcomputers, and (3) To provide system interconnection devices and standard software for system initialization and diagnostics. The status of development has been reported upon at each prior Nuclear Science Symposium since 1977. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to briefly review the characteristics of FASTBUS, recent progress toward finalization of the specification, and anticipated future directions. The paper will mention primarily developments in the U. S., since a separate paper at this Conference will cover European developments.
