Due to policy-driven inter-domain routing, the physical connectivity {{does not necessarily}} imply network reachability in the AS-level graph, i. e., many physical paths are not visible by the inter-domain routing protocol for connectivity recovery during Internet outages. We call the invisible connectivity at the routing layer, which can be quickly restored for recovering routing failures by simple configurations, as the potential routing diversities. In this paper, we evaluate two kinds of potential routing diversities, which are recognized as Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) participant reconnection and peering policy relaxation. Using the most complete dataset containing AS-level map and IXP participants that we can achieve, we successfully evaluate the ability of potential routing diversity for routing recovery during different kinds of Internet emergencies. Encouragingly, our experimental results show that 40 % to 80 % of the interrupted network pairs can be recovered on average beyond policy-compliant paths, with rich <b>path</b> <b>diversities</b> and a little traffic shifts.

In order to satisfy the growing demand for higher data rates, one possible solution is to exploit both spatial and multi <b>path</b> <b>diversities</b> via the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and proper coding techniques. In this paper, we propose a general framework to analyze the performance of multi band UWB-MIMO systems regardless of specific coding schemes. A combination of space-time-frequency (STF) coding and hopping multi band OFDM modulation is also proposed to fully exploit all of the available spatial and frequency diversities, richly inherent in UWB environments. We quantify the performance merits of the proposed scheme in case of Nakagami- frequency-selective fading channels. Different from the conventional STF coded MIMO-OFDM system, the performance of the STF coded hopping multi band UWB does not depend on the temporal correlation of the propagation channel. We show that the maximum achievable diversity of multi band UWB-MIMO system is the product of the number of transmit and receive antennas, the number of multi path components, and the number of jointly encoded OFDM symbols. Interestingly, the diversity gain does not severely depend on the fading parameter, and the diversity advantage obtained under Nakagami fading with arbitrary parameter is almost the same as that obtained in Rayleigh fading channels. Finally, simulation results are presented to support the theoretical analysis...|$|R
