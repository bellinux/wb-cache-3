5|$|Conservapedia's {{article on}} {{evolution}} presents evolution as a naturalistic theory that lacks support and that conflicts with {{evidence in the}} fossil record that creationists <b>perceive</b> <b>to</b> support creationism. The entry also suggests that sometimes the Bible has been more scientifically correct than the scientific community. Schlafly has defended the statement as presenting an alternative to evolution.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they <b>perceive</b> <b>to</b> be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins as}} Eric Harris' mother wakes him on April 20, 1999. Harris phones Dylan Klebold, and the pair meet in Harris' {{basement}} to plot {{a series of}} bombings that will precede their planned shooting. The two reminisce about the bullying they experienced at Columbine High and express rage at those they <b>perceive</b> <b>to</b> be their tormentors. Harris and Klebold make a video, apologizing to their parents and asking them not to blame themselves for what will follow. The two boys collect their guns and bombs, pack a duffel bag with weapons, and leave home.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Hierarchies {{established}} in schools {{can lead to}} violence among students, particularly bullying, and this relationship is investigated in this study. A School Hierarchies Scale and a Peer Perception of Aggression Scale were applied to 274 9 th grade students, both sexes, aged 14. 08 years (SD = 0. 81) old on average, attending four {{public schools in the}} state of São Paulo, Brazil. The students more frequently <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be popular, were among the best in physical education and/or among the worst in academic subjects were also more frequently <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be bullies, while those more frequently <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be unpopular and having the worst performance in physical education were also more frequently <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be victims. Therefore, teachers should reflect upon the issue and fight school violence that may arise from these hierarchies...|$|R

Negative emotions associated with wrongful action can include guilt, regret, remorse, blame, shame, self-hatred and/or self-contempt.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, the World Health Organization (WHO) has {{estimates that}} only 50% of people complete long-term therapy for chronic illnesses {{as they were}} prescribed, which puts patient health at risk. For example, statin compliance drops to between 25-40% {{after two years of}} treatment, with patients taking statins for what they <b>perceive</b> <b>to</b> be preventative reasons being unusually poor compliers.|$|E

With many efforts, hospital must to make the patient feel comfortable with the services. The main objective is to analyze the importance and performance services at R. W Mongisidi General Hospital in Manado. The type {{of this research is}} descriptive quantitative methods. By using Impotance Performance Analysis (IPA) as analytical tool. In this research the samples taken are as much as 60 respondent (patient). The result of this research is (1) the level of importance, competence factor <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be important, for the level of performance is <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be low. (2) the level of importance, access factor is <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be important, for the level of performance, is to be low.

25|$|However, {{the monarchy}} {{became the focus}} of acute {{criticism}} from part of the left and right of the Spanish political spectrum, and by regional separatists. As many as 22% of Spanish citizens feel that a republic would be the better form of government for Spain, while separatists and independence supporters in the Basque Country and Catalonia routinely protest the monarchy as the living symbol of a united Spain. Part of the left criticize the institution of monarchy as anachronistic, while the far right criticize King Juan Carlos personally because he has given his royal assent and tacit approval to what they <b>perceive</b> <b>to</b> be a liberal agenda in Spain and a secularism of Spanish life.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{perceived}} forms and drivers of sexual and gender based violence in post conflict settings with focus on Northern Uganda. It applied qualitative approaches primarily using in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Study findings revealed that although {{all forms of}} violence are <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be prevalent, physical and emotional violence were <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be the most occurring. Men were <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be the main perpetrators of violence. However, there were cases of men who reported to experience violence from women. Few men reported violence to authorities because it was <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be stigmatizing; such men would be perceived as weak in a patriarchal society that <b>perceives</b> ideal men <b>to</b> be strong and less susceptible to physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Early marriages are a major form of gender based violence which was perceived as normal {{in a number of}} communities despite the evidence that it contributes to negative social and reproductive health outcomes. Sexual violence cases in form of rape, defilement as well as incest were <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be on the rise in the sub-region. The study identified several drivers of SGBV including poverty, power imbalances in access to and control over resources, insecurity, blaming HIV infection on female partners, HIV related stigma and discrimination, alcohol and substance abuse...|$|R

25|$|Planned reuse of {{reclaimed}} {{water from}} Greater Irbid in the Jordan Valley. A major water reuse project is being planned to reuse water from three {{wastewater treatment plants}} {{in the area of}} Irbid in the North of Jordan through a project supported in the framework of Jordanian-German cooperation. As of 2006, only 14% of the wastewater from these plants was being reused. An explanation for this is that farmers in the Jordan Valley are reluctant to use the reclaimed water, which they <b>perceive</b> <b>to</b> be of poor quality, for irrigation. The wastewater thus flows into the Jordan River, unused. In the future, the treated effluent from the three plants will flow through a pipe into the Jordan Valley, generating hydropower from the elevation differential of more than 1,000m. It will then be mixed with freshwater and delivered to the farmers in a quality that is acceptable to them.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many {{instances}} showing {{that there is a}} form of aphasia among deaf individuals. Sign language is, after all, a form of communication that has been shown to use the same areas of the brain as verbal forms of communication. Mirror neurons become activated when an animal is acting in a particular way or watching another individual act in the same manner. These mirror neurons are important in giving an individual the ability to mimic movements of hands. Broca's area of speech production has been shown to contain several of these mirror neurons resulting in significant similarities of brain activity between sign language and vocal speech communication. Facial communication is a significant portion of how animals interact with each other. Humans use facial movements to create, what other humans <b>perceive,</b> <b>to</b> be faces of emotions. While combining these facial movements with speech, a more full form of language is created which enables the species to interact with a much more complex and detailed form of communication. Sign language also uses these facial movements and emotions along with the primary hand movement way of communicating. These facial movement forms of communication come from the same areas of the brain. When dealing with damages to certain areas of the brain, vocal forms of communication are in jeopardy of severe forms of aphasia. Since these same areas of the brain are being used for sign language, these same, at least very similar, forms of aphasia can show in the Deaf community. Individuals can show a form of Wernicke's aphasia with sign language and they show deficits in their abilities in being able to produce any form of expressions. Broca's aphasia shows up in some patients, as well. These individuals find tremendous difficulty in being able to actually sign the linguistic concepts they are trying to express.|$|E
