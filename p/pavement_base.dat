The geotechnical performance of the recycled aggregate blends of particular interest in this research were FRG blended with RCA (FRG/RCA) and FRG blended with WR (FRG/WR) in <b>pavement</b> <b>base</b> applications. The geotechnical performance of a trial road pavement was assessed by means of initial laboratory tests and subsequently field tests. The initial laboratory experimental programme included specialized geotechnical tests including Repeated Load Triaxial and triaxial tests to characterize the recycled materials. The subsequent trial road pavement constructed comprised of 7 different sections of FRG blends in the <b>pavement</b> <b>base</b> varying from 10 to 30 % recycled glass content as well as 2 control sections with RCA and WR.

40|$|The {{advantages}} of utilizing recycled materials/byproducts in pavement construction are numerous. The reduction in landfilling {{resulting from the}} adoption of recycled materials in large quanitites primarily promotes their usage. Most of the recycled materials are used successfully throughout the world as embankment fill or subgrade foundation material. Although the utilization of the recycled materials/byproducts as <b>pavement</b> <b>bases</b> has been gaining increased acceptance, comprehensive geotechnical characterization of these materials is still lacking. In a research project, Limestone quarry fines (QF), which are a residue deposit produced from limestone quarries, and reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) aggregates, obtained from milling existing hot-mix asphalt (HMA) pavement layers, were characterized in both laboratory and field conditions. Before the usage of these materials as <b>pavement</b> <b>bases,</b> a series of laboratory tests were conducted to verify their engineering behavior and suitability. Shear strength and consolidation tests were performed to evaluate both strength and compressibility characteristics. Repeated load triaxial tests were conducted to obtain the resilient behavior of these recycled materials. Because the QF material exhibited both low strength and low moduli, cement stabilization was performed to enhance the material properties. The treated materials were then used as bases in test sections built {{as a part of}} the state highway. These test sections were instrumented and monitored for approximately 3 years. However, the long-term performance of the new materials is crucial for highways. Henceforth, numerical simulations were performed to predict the-performance of the test sections. This paper presents a summary of test results obtained from the laboratory, field, and numerical studies, and the results were analysed to evaluate the efficacy of these materials as <b>pavement</b> <b>bases...</b>|$|R

Inverted <b>base</b> <b>pavements</b> rely on the complementary interaction between layers. The cement-treated base provides a stiff foundation for efficient compaction and constrains the deformation of the stress-sensitive granular aggregate base.

40|$|The use of {{demolition}} waste as <b>pavement</b> <b>base</b> material is a promising but unproven technique for road rehabilitation and construction. A {{survey was conducted}} by Building Economics Department of University of Moratuwa found that {{demolition waste}} is infrequently used in this application due primarily {{to a lack of}} practical knowledge about the engineering properties of the material. Therefore, this research was aimed at evaluating the physical properties, strength parameters, and durability characteristics of demolition waste to use as <b>pavement</b> <b>base</b> material. The study included extensive laboratory and prototype model testing. Laboratory tests included flakiness index value, elongation index, aggregate impact value, Los Angeles abrasion value test, California bearing ratio, unconfined compressive strength and durability evaluations. Prototype modeling was utilized to compare demolition waste with respect to general base materials. It included a plate load test and dynamic cone penetrometer. The prototype model demonstrated that the demolition waste base layer was susceptible to stiffness changes due primarily to changes in moisture. Prototype model results have been verified using ‘Everstress’ back-calculation software and it can be shown that the layer coefficient of CCM is equivalent to 0. 134. And also this material shows a very high variability with respect to conventional base materials i. e. DGAB. Therefore it is recommended to use this material as a base material for a traffic load of 20 kN or less. And it will perform a strong correlation as given in design charts & tables. Finally it was possible to evaluate a structural capacity of demolition waste and develop a design chart to replace dense graded aggregate base course from demolition waste base layer for construction of roads.
