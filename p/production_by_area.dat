40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a model of}} calculating indices of attachment of fish stock to fisheries zones based on biological parameters. Input data are weight by age, mortality rate and the percentage area distribution of an "average" year class of the stock throughout its lifespan, The model calculates indices of biomass distribution and biomass <b>production</b> <b>by</b> <b>area</b> on a per recruit basis for any predetermined stage of life (age groups, spawners, etc.). Assuming that these indices of an average year class throughout its lifespan equal {{the sum of the}} respective indices of all year classes in one year, the calculated indices can be used as keys in allocating catch quotas of joint stocks to fishery zones. The model is implemented on a spread sheet (Excel) and data of the northern blue whiting stock are used as an example...|$|E

The empirical analysis is {{based on the work of}} the Shift-Share model, also known as a differential structure. In the results from 1990 to 2009 (total period), there is the hypothesis of the higher average yield of sugarcane in the Southeast and of the pattern of growth <b>production</b> <b>by</b> <b>area</b> in the Midwest. On the other hand, in the period 2005 to 2009, where the two regions in question had the highest growth rates of production of sugar cane, the composition effect revealed the most significant values, showing that the expansion of sugarcane production has occurred in these regions, mainly by substituting other crops by land less profitable...|$|E
40|$|The morphoedaphic index (MEI) {{has been}} ased {{globally}} as a fish-yield estimator with widely divergent resalts. With few exceptions, when the index did not predict fish yield with moderate precision, practitioners had not exercised carerally {{the criteria for}} application. The fandamental concept of the MEI embraces tandard thermodynamic theory, that of matter (natrients) trans-ported by energy within an open system. Fish yield is a biotic oatpat of the system. Constraints {{on the level of}} fish yield are determined by lake-basin morphometry and natrient and energy availability. Of the three morphometric factors considered, mean depth, volame, and area, mean depth appears to be the variable most closely linked with prodaction processes. The major direct effect on <b>production</b> <b>by</b> <b>area</b> is that expressed by the elementary mathematics of both size and of scale, particularly perimeter-to-area nd area-to-volume ratios which change mark-edly in lakes of different total surface areas. Volumetric effects contain elements similar to those of both area and mean depth. A rational approach to fish-yield estimation may be made at three hierarchic levels: (1) a global evel at which area and temperature assume major importance; (2) a regional level at which nutrients and mean depth become the critical variables as area and temperature are held constant; (3) an infra-regional level at which either a nutrient or a depth variable alone may be used for fish-yield estimates while the remaining variable is constant.

40|$|A simple {{model of}} lower trophic level {{ecosystem}} {{has been created}} to analyze possible environmental control of primary production in eight sub-areas of the Seto Inland Sea. The primary <b>production</b> rates observed <b>by</b> Hashimoto et al. (1997 a) in these sub-areas are well reproduced by the model, including horizontal processes such as horizontal trans-port of nutrients and vertical processes such as vertical mixing, light intensity and sinking of particulate matter. Without taking account of horizontal processes, the model also successfully reproduces the observed primary production rates in some areas, but it fails to reproduce those in the others. This shows that {{the relative importance of}} the horizontal transport on the primary <b>production</b> differs <b>area</b> <b>by</b> <b>area.</b> Two time scales, TZ and TH, are introduced to explain this difference. TZ is a vertical cycling time of material, which is defined as the time during which the stock of the material in the water column is utilized for primary production; TH is the horizontal transit time of the material. The relative importance of the horizontal process is well explained by the TH/TZ ratio; that is, the horizontal transport process is important in the areas where this ratio is small. Further the possible mechanisms of nutrient supply for the primary production in each sub-area are investigated using this model. Keywords: ⋅Primary production, ⋅ ecosystem model...|$|R

40|$|The Common Market Organisation (CMO) for {{fruit and}} {{vegetable}} products is currently evaluated by the European Commission. The evaluation {{may lead to a}} reform of the CMO. One of the elements under debate is the production subsidy for processing tomatoes. The processing tomato sector is one of most heavily subsidized sectors in primary production of {{fruit and vegetable}}s. The current production subsidy equals approximately 50 % of producer turnover. This paper evaluates two possible reforms of the processing tomato supply chain: (1) an abolishment of the production subsidy and (2) a replacement of the <b>production</b> subsidy <b>by</b> <b>area</b> payments (decoupling). The evaluation focuses on the impact the reform may have on production and trade patterns of fruits and vegetables in Europe. On the basis of a simulation model, the paper argues that in the first scenario production will shift in the Mediterranean from processing tomatoes and extensive crop production in general towards fruit and fruit vegetables. The abolishment of the production subsidy will lead to a production shift in the direction in which Mediterranean countries have a comparative advantage. In the second scenario, Mediterranean production will remain stuck in extensive crop production: processing tomatoes, extensive vegetables and arable crops. In the first scenario, Mediterranean countries will crowd out North European fruit production. As a result, North European production shifts towards vegetable production. In the second scenario, the impact on North Europe is negligible. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

40|$|Regeneration of {{articular}} cartilage damage {{is an area}} of great interest due to the limited ability of cartilage to self-repair. The latest cartilage repair strategies are dependent on access to biomaterials to which chondrocytes can attach and in which they can migrate and proliferate, producing their own extracellular matrix. In the present study, engineered porous bacterial cellulose (BC) scaffolds were prepared by fermentation of Acetobacter xylinum (A. xylinum) in the presence of slightly fused wax particles with a diameter of 150 - 300 mu m, which were then removed by extrusion. This porous material was evaluated as a scaffold for cartilage regeneration. Articular chondrocytes from young adult patients as well as neonatal articular chondrocytes were seeded with various seeding techniques onto the porous BC scaffolds. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis and confocal microscopy analysis showed that cells entered the pores of the scaffolds and that they increasingly filled out the pores over time. Furthermore, DNA analysis implied that the chondrocytes proliferated within the porous BC.

50|$|Fire blight {{was first}} {{described}} in New York {{in the late}} 18th century, and moved west with settlers, becoming established throughout North American apple <b>production</b> <b>areas</b> <b>by</b> the early 20th century. While fire blight {{has always been a}} concern in eastern apple production, severe outbreaks in the west in recent years have caused growers there to adopt more consistent and vigorous monitoring and management programs as well. The disease can affect every part of the tree, from the fruit to the trunk. Infected trees may die within months or can linger for years with severely reduced yields. In addition to the scorched appearance of the plant parts that gives the disease its name, plant tissues infected with the bacteria will exude milky or reddish-brown ooze. Initially copper sprays were used for fire blight control in the 1930s but this method had limited success. In the 1950s streptomycin and oxytetracycline showed high success in controlling fire blight in comparison to copper.

The results indicate that liberalisation leads to a further increase in greenhouse gas emissions adding to an already observed increase in emissions observed in the baseline scenario. CO 2 emission increase is caused by vegetation clearance due to a rapid expansion of agricultural areas in South America and South East Asia. Increased methane emissions are also calculated in these <b>areas</b> caused <b>by</b> less intensive cattle farming.
