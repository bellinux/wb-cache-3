The application of hydrogen is a new field which is involved in production, storage, translation, fuel-cell application and so on. Especially, the storage of hydrogen is the restrictive factor in hydrogen economy. The traditional storage methods of hydrogen by compressing and liquefaction can not satisfy the requirement of application. Therefore, attention is currently focused on the new hydrogen storage technology.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this work is on the {{modeling}} and simulation of shock wave propagation in reactive metal powder mixtures. Reactive metal systems are non-explosive, solid-state materials that release chemical energy when subjected to sufficiently strong stimuli. Shock loading experiments have demonstrated that ultra-fast chemical reactions can be achieved in certain micron-sized metal powder mixtures. However, the mechanisms of rapid mixing that drive these chemical reactions are currently unclear. The goal {{of this research is}} to gain an understanding of the shock-induced deformation that enables these ultra-fast reactions. The problem is approached using direct numerical simulation. In this work, a finite element (FE) model is developed to simulate shock wave propagation in discrete particle mixtures. This provides explicit particle-level resolution of the thermal and mechanical fields that develop in the shock wave. The Ni/Al <b>powder</b> <b>system</b> has been selected for study. To facilitate mesoscale FE simulation, a new dislocation-based constitutive model has been developed to address the viscoplastic deformation of fcc metals at very high strain rates. Six distinct initial configurations of the Ni/Al <b>powder</b> <b>system</b> have been simulated to quantify the effects of powder configuration (e. g., particle size, phase morphology, and constituent volume fractions) on deformation in the shock wave. Results relevant to the degree of shock-induced mixing in the Ni/Al powders are presented, including specific analysis of the thermodynamic state and microstructure of the Ni/Al interfaces that develop during wave propagation. Finally, it is shown that velocity fluctuations at the Ni/Al interfaces (which arise due to material heterogeneity) may serve to fragment the particles down to the nanoscale, and thus provide an explanation of ultra-fast chemical reactions in these material systems.

The optimal pH and stochiometry for H 202 and Fe 2 + in the oxidation of the azo dyes were investigated; an experimental optimal ratio was also compared to a theoretical optimal ratio of H 202 to Fe 2 +. The optimal oxidation of monoazo and disazo dyes is at pH 3 and pH 4, respectively. The optimal ratio for monoazo and disazo dyes ranged from 1 to 10.

Complexation was observed in oxidation of trisazo dye Direct Blue 71. A lower optimal ratio of H 202 to Fe 2 + for trisazo dye than ratios required for mono and disazo dyes, is due to a larger amount of Fe 2 + associated with Fe complexation of chromophore.
