25|$|The {{terminal}} building has {{a capacity of}} 400 passengers. The terminal houses a metal detector and an X-ray machine, both located at the main entrance of the airport and before entering the <b>Pre-Departure</b> Area.

25|$|The Brigade {{assembled}} at Sonderwater, located east of Cullinan, {{and took}} part in a <b>pre-departure</b> parade attended by General J.C. Smuts, the prime minister and defence minister, on 13 July 1940. The date also celebrated the Delville Wood Day, as the anniversary of a battle on the Western Front in July 1916 when the 1st South African Brigade had advanced into the Delville Wood. The next day the Brigade entrained for Durban, and on 16 July embarked by ship for Mombasa, Kenya where it commenced training not far from Nairobi in the Kenyan Highlands. On 6 September 1940, the 1st Transvaal Scottish was transferred to the 2nd East African Brigade under British command, and {{took part in}} the first action involving South African ground troops in the Second World War near Liboi when a column was attacked by a force of Banda and Italian Colonial infantry.|$|E
25|$|National Student Exchange (NSE) is a not-for-profit {{education}} consortium {{based in}} the United States that provides affordable and practical opportunities for students enrolled at member campuses to study and live in a new location. More than 94,000 students {{have participated in the}} program since it was founded in 1968. NSE is designed for students who are looking for opportunities to study in a different state rather than a different country. NSE operates at member colleges and universities in the United States, Canada, Australia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Nearly 200 universities and colleges are registered as NSE members. The application process, placement, and the <b>pre-departure</b> process are coordinated by the home NSE coordinator. The student can choose to pay the required tuition fees to their home campus or to the host campus. Students may only participate in the exchange for a cumulative total of one calendar year, defined as an academic year and a summer session.|$|E
25|$|On 13 August 2016, Hart {{was dropped}} by new manager Pep Guardiola {{for the first}} match of the 2016–17 Premier League season. The absence {{followed}} his poor performances in Euro 2016, and Guardiola's desire for a player with better footwork who could fill a sweeper-keeper role. Hart made his first start of the 2016–17 season in a Champions League qualifying match against Steaua Bucharest, as captain of the City side that won 1–0 on the night, 6–0 on aggregate. Following the match, Hart was applauded by the crowd, in an atmosphere which was described as resembling a <b>pre-departure</b> testimonial. Following speculation linking Hart with various top European clubs, including Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund, Everton, Liverpool, Milan and Sevilla, Hart surprisingly decided to pursue a season-long loan in the Serie A with Torino. In doing so, {{he became the first}} English goalkeeper to sign for a Serie A club since the league's inception in 1929.|$|E
25|$|Schur {{found himself}} lonely after {{the flight of}} many of his {{students}} and the expulsion of renowned scientists from his previous place of work. Only Dr. Helmut Grunsky had been friendly to him, as Schur reported in the late thirties to his expatriate student Max Menachem Schiffer. The Gestapo was everywhere. Since Schur had announced to his wife his intentions to commit suicide in case of a summons to the Gestapo, in the summer of 1938 his wife took his letters, and with them a summons from the Gestapo, sent Issai Schur to a relaxing stay in a home outside of Berlin and went with medical certificate allowing her to meet the Gestapo in place of her husband. There they flatly asked why they were still staying in Germany. But there were economic obstacles to the planned emigration : Emigrating Germans had a <b>pre-departure</b> Reich Flight Tax to pay, which was a quarter of their assets. Now Schur's wife had inherited a mortgage on a house in Lithuania, which because of the Lithuanian foreign exchange determination could not be repaid. On the other hand, Schur was forbidden to default or leave the mortgage to the German Reich. Thus the Schurs lacked cash and cash equivalents. Finally, the missing sum of money was somehow supplied, and to this day {{it does not seem to}} be clear who were the donors.|$|E
500|$|The airport's {{problems}} {{continued to}} linger with {{it into the}} new millennium. The increasing incidence of terrorism in the Philippines for example forced aviation officials to restrict airport access only to passengers, the sealing of doors and windows at airport terminals being an essential component thereof. [...] However, the airport's architecture (which took advantage of natural ventilation) and lack of air conditioning made the airport's <b>pre-departure</b> and arrival areas very uncomfortable for passengers to stay in. To counteract this, the Air Transportation Office (the forerunner of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines) installed six air-conditioning units at the <b>pre-departure</b> area. Although the installed units were able to provide a degree of comfort to passengers, the ATO recognized that their efforts were inadequate: in order to effectively provide a comfortable environment for passengers throughout the entire terminal building, twenty-three air conditioners needed to be installed. [...] Passenger complaints meanwhile were not limited to just the lack of air conditioning: despite {{the existence of a}} baggage X-ray machine, passengers flying other airlines were forced to have their baggage manually checked as the machine was ostensibly for the sole use of Philippine Airlines passengers.|$|E
500|$|The airport has a [...] main {{passenger}} terminal {{designed to accommodate}} around 1.2million passengers annually. [...] Regarded {{as one of the}} most beautifully designed airport terminals in the Philippines, its architectural style is said to be reminiscent of Hong Kong International Airport, albeit on a smaller scale. [...] It is divided into three levels: arrivals and baggage claim on the first floor, check-in on the second floor and departures on the third floor. [...] The <b>pre-departure</b> area at Iloilo International Airport has a capacity of 436 passengers. [...] Three jet bridges protrude from the terminal above a [...] apron, enabling Iloilo International Airport to handle up to six aircraft simultaneously. When fully extended, the jet bridges stretch to a length of [...]|$|E
500|$|In March 1951, the First Sea Lord {{requested}} that Sydney be deployed to Korea while [...] was refitted in Australia, {{to maintain a}} Commonwealth carrier presence. This was agreed to, and a 38-strong wartime CAG was formed on 14 May by incorporating the Sea Furies of 805 Squadron into the 21st CAG. Because RAN Fireflies were optimised for anti-submarine warfare, and consequently not fitted with cannon, cannon-equipped RN aircraft were loaned {{for the duration of}} Sydney‘s deployment. After completing <b>pre-departure</b> exercises, during which several aircraft were destroyed in non-fatal, weather-induced deck crashes, Sydney and the destroyer [...] sailed for Korea on 31 August. While en route, the carrier's aircraft were used for a fly-past demonstration over Rabaul on 6 September, following civil unrest. On her arrival, Sydney became the first aircraft carrier owned by a Commonwealth dominion to see wartime service.|$|E
500|$|Despite <b>pre-departure</b> {{forecasts}} of good weather, the force encountered thick clouds after entering Finnish airspace; this continued {{for the remainder}} of the flight. The conditions made navigation difficult, and forced the pilots to fly at a low altitude so that they could use features on the ground to determine their location. Only 26 of the Lancasters were able to locate Yagodnik and land there during the morning of 12 September, the other 13 touching down at other airfields or crash landing in open spaces. Five or six of the later aircraft were written off, and two of the seven which eventually reached Yagodnik were too badly damaged to be used in operations. Despite the number of crashes, none of the airmen on board these aircraft were injured. McMullen recorded that it was [...] "extraordinary that so few crashes occurred" [...] given the adverse circumstances, and that the majority of the aircraft dispatched could have been destroyed.|$|E
500|$|The {{programme}} is the UK's [...] "quota refugee" [...] resettlement scheme. Refugees {{designated as}} particularly vulnerable by the UNHCR are {{assessed by the}} Home Office for eligibility under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. If they meet the eligibility criteria they are then brought to the UK and granted indefinite leave to remain. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) helps facilitate <b>pre-departure</b> medical screening, counselling, dossier preparation, transport and immediate arrival assistance. Once in the UK, refugees are entered into a 12-month support programme intended to aid their integration. The programme has involved local authorities and NGOs including the British Red Cross, the International Rescue Committee, Migrant Helpline, Refugee Action, the Refugee Arrivals Project, the Refugee Council, Scottish Refugee Council and Refugee Support. These organisations formed the Resettlement Inter-Agency Partnership {{at the planning stage}} of the programme, in order to pool their resources and form a partnership for the delivery of services to the resettled refugees.|$|E
