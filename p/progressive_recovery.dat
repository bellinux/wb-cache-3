40|$|Abstract—Network {{virtualization}} {{allows users}} to build cus-tomized interconnected storage/computing configurations for their business needs. Today this capability is being widely used to improve the scalability and reliability of cloud-based services, including virtual infrastructures services. However, {{as more and more}} business-critical applications migrate to the cloud, disaster recovery is now a major concern. Although some studies have looked at network virtualization design under such scenarios, most have only studied pre-fault protection provisioning. Indeed, there is a pressing need to address post-fault recovery, since physical infrastructure repairs will likely occur in a staged progressive manner due to constraints on available resources. Hence this paper studies <b>progressive</b> <b>recovery</b> design for network virtualization and evaluates several heuristic strategies.

40|$|Networks using {{wormhole}} switching {{have traditionally}} relied upon deadlock avoidance {{strategies for the}} design of routing algorithms. More recently, deadlock recovery strategies have begun to gain acceptance. <b>Progressive</b> deadlock <b>recovery</b> techniques are very attractive because they allocate a few dedicated resources to quickly deliver deadlocked messages, instead of killing them. However, the distributed deadlock detection techniques proposed up to now detect many false deadlocks, especially when the network is heavily loaded and messages have different lengths. As a consequence, messages detected as deadlocked may saturate the bandwidth offered by recovery resources, thus degrading performance considerably. In this paper we propose an improved distributed deadlock detection mechanism that uses only local information, detects all the deadlocks, considerably reduces the probability of false deadlock detection and is not strongly affected by variations in message length and message destin [...] ...|$|R
30|$|This {{article has}} {{presented}} a layered multimedia broadcast scheme using rateless codes with <b>progressive</b> <b>recovery</b> over cooperative MIMO. In this broadcast scheme, first a two-phase CB protocol is {{proposed to improve}} {{the reliability of the}} broadcast, which efficiently extends the coverage of the source nodes and decreases the packet loss rate of bad destination nodes. Second, we propose the PRC to enhance rateless codes with <b>progressive</b> <b>recovery.</b> By assigning unequal redundant packets to each layer with their importance, the PRC can recover layered multimedia at designated received ratio of output symbols, which outperforms the other unequal protected rateless codes such as SP-FEC and LA-FEC in [21] with much lower overhead. Third, based on the PRC and given PLRs of intended destinations in the system, a distortion-based layered multimedia broadcast optimization problem is formulated to improve the QoE of the broadcast system. By the optimized layered source bitrate and coding rates of PRC, the average transmission quality, i.e., PSNR of videos and images, has been maximized. Using resolution scalable Motion-JPEG 2000 video sequence, the receivers with different PLRs can recover a progressive resolution video stream adaptively. Analytical and experimental results suggest the superiority of the Cooperative broadcast scheme and the efficiency of the QoE-driven optimization algorithm.|$|E
