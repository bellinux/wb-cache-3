40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} {{focusing}} on the measurement methods of the femoral head at the hip hemiarthroplasty surgery. The measurement result of 10 femoral head specimens using four different methods of Vernier calliper, <b>ring</b> <b>gauge,</b> CT scan and X-ray were compared. It is generally believed that under sizing of the implant may cover the errors of the measurement methods, but {{the result of this}} study shows that the callipers and <b>ring</b> <b>gauge</b> measurements are more reliable than the CT and X-ray methods. Conclusively, the full-circle <b>ring</b> <b>gauge</b> or femoral head template is the recommendation for measurement of the femoral head diameter in the hip hemiarthroplasty surgery...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent work}} {{to improve the}} measurement of the stress response of materials to intense, short pulses of radiation. When Saturn fires, large prompt electrical noise pulses are induced in stress measurement circuits. The conventional wisdom {{has been that the}} shorted guard <b>ring</b> quartz <b>gauge</b> was the only configuration with acceptable prompt signal-to-noise characteristics for stress measurements in this pulsed radiation environment. However, because of abnormal signal distortion, the shorted guard <b>ring</b> <b>gauge</b> is restricted to a maximum stress of about 8 kbars. Below this level, the normal, quantified signal distortion is correctable with analytical deconvolution techniques. The shunted guard <b>ring</b> <b>gauge</b> is acceptable for Egli fidelity measurements to about 25 kbars with negligible signal distortion. Experiments were conducted on the Saturn soft x-ray source which show that higher fidelity shunted guard <b>ring</b> <b>gauges</b> can successfully measure stress with acceptable induced noise. We also found that a 50 -ohm impedance matching resistor at the gauge reduced the prompt noise amplitude and improved the baseline quality of the measurement prior to shock wave arrival...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the process}} of a hip total or hemi-arthroplasty, {{patients}} have their femur measured and analysed {{in order to obtain}} a suitable hip implant for the operation. This study investigates the existing methods to measure the femoral head before a total or hemi- arthroplasty. In the experimental evaluation of the current study, the size of 15 femur head sample has been measured using four different methods: Vernier caliper, <b>ring</b> <b>gauge,</b> X-ray images and CT scan data. The results from various methods were compared and discussed. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyse the most effective mode of measurement for hemi-arthoplastic surgery. The accuracy and reliability of each method was analysed by taking measurements of the femoral head. Statistical analysis shows that the callipers and <b>ring</b> <b>gauge</b> are the most accurate next to CT and X-ray models. It was also observed that an under sizing by ± 1 mm of the femoral head shows no definitive harm to a patient...|$|R
40|$|An {{automated}} {{setup for}} non-tactile high-precision measurements of roundness and cylindricity of <b>ring</b> <b>gauges</b> {{is presented in}} this paper. The aim is to overcome classical problems of tactile and radial roundness measurements such as the error influences of the used rotary table and the work piece alignment and thus to increase the accuracy and reduce the measurement time. To achieve those aims a double interferometer concept was chosen and combined with a measurement system for the work piece alignment, a high precision rotary table and an automated four-axes adjustment unit. The main alignment errors of the work pieces (e. g. <b>ring</b> <b>gauges)</b> such as eccentricity and tilting are either suppressed or directly detected and consequently reduced by the automated four-axes adjustment unit. Due to the non-tactile measurement concept and the contactless energy supply of the four-axes adjustment unit, the radial run of the rotary table is not affected.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{operator}} contact force influence {{on the performance of}} Articulated Arm Coordinate Measuring Machines (AACMMs) is presented in this paper. After developing a sensor capable of measuring the contact force applied by an operator, a <b>ring</b> <b>gauge</b> has been used to analyse the relationship between the contact force and diameter and form errors measured with the AACMM. As a result, contact force has been proved as one of the main factors influencing the AACMM performance. A probe deflection model based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) has been also proposed in order to obtain the AACMM probe deflection caused by contact force. This allows measurement correction by comparing them with reference values, specifically, a <b>ring</b> <b>gauge.</b> Experimental test results show a significant measurement improvement that minimizes diameter error. Finally, an uncertainty evaluation for the contact force sensor and AACMM measurements with and without probe deflection model has been carried out in order to validate the ability of the sensor and the methodology followed...|$|R
