25|$|The {{transfer}} characteristic of RO is usually represented as the electrical {{resistance of the}} photoresistor {{as a function of}} the current through the light source; it is a convolution of three main factors: the dependence of light source intensity on its current, optical coupling and spectral matching between the light source and photoresistor, and the <b>photoresponse</b> of the photoresistor. The first dependence is almost linear and temperature independent for LEDs in the practical range of the controlling current. On the contrary, for incandescent lamps the light-current curve is not linear, and the emission spectrum varies with temperature, and thus with the input current. As to the light detector, its properties depend on temperature, voltage and the history of utilization (memory effect). Therefore, the {{transfer characteristic}} takes a range of values.|$|E

2500|$|Response time: A photon {{absorbed by}} the {{semiconducting}} material will generate an electron-hole pair which will in turn start moving in the material under {{the effect of the}} electric field and thus generate a current. The finite duration of this current is known as the transit-time spread and can be evaluated by using Ramo's theorem. One can also show with this theorem that the total charge generated in the external circuit is well e and not 2e as might seem by the presence of the two carriers. Indeed, the integral of the current due to both electron and hole over time must be equal to e. The resistance and capacitance of the photodiode and the external circuitry give rise to another response time known as RC time constant [...] This combination of R and C integrates the <b>photoresponse</b> over time and thus lengthens the impulse response of the photodiode. When used in an optical communication system, the response time determines the bandwidth available for signal modulation and thus data transmission.|$|E

Properties of <b>photoresponses</b> were analyzed under each condition of adaptation when retinas were superfused with 1. 0 mM guanosine 5 '-[beta, gamma-methylene]triphosphate (p[CH 2]ppG), a hydrolysis-resistant analog od GTP.

Activation was quickly reversed by exposure to clean water and was not affected by feeding or starvation. Thus, brine shrimp nauplii have a phenotypic response to a zooplankton predator.

Feeding on phytoplankton quickly reversed activation, which was not affected by exposure to predators.

The condition is that current entering at the tip is represented with greater weight in the ERG. The model reproduces recorded ERG waveforms well. It further predicts {{that if there is}} a light-in sensitive conductance in the tip membrane, ERG <b>photoresponses</b> may be non-recordable although current <b>photoresponses</b> are only slightly reduced.

40|$|AbstractMelanopsin, a novel photopigment, has {{recently}} been localized to a population of retinal ganglion cells that display inherent photosensitivity. During continuous light and following light offset, primates are known to exhibit sustained pupilloconstriction responses that resemble closely the <b>photoresponses</b> of intrinsically-photoreceptive ganglion cells. We report that, in the behaving macaque, following pharmacological blockade of conventional photoreceptor signals, significant pupillary responses persist during continuous light and following light offset. These pupil responses display the unique spectral tuning, slow kinetics, and irradiance coding of the sustained, melanopsin-derived ganglion cell <b>photoresponses.</b> We extended our observations to humans by using the sustained pupil response following light offset to document the contribution of these novel ganglion cells to human pupillary responses.

In {{the presence of}} a concentration of external Ca 2 + above 10 (- 5) M, voltage <b>photoresponses</b> were observed only in the presence of external Na+ or Li+. When external Ca 2 + was reduced below 10 (- 6) M, voltage <b>photoresponses</b> of normal polarity could be detected {{even in the absence of}} Na+ or Li+, but in the presence of external Mg 2 +. In the presence of normal extracellular Ca 2 + hyperpolarizing <b>photoresponses</b> were observed even in the absence of Na+ or Li+, provided small amounts of phosphodiesterase inhibitors (IBMX, RO 20 - 1724, papaverine, caffeine, theophylline) were added to the perfusate. Responses obtained in low-Na+ IBMX solutions required the presence of millimolar amounts of a variety of divalent cations, among which Mn 2 + and Ba 2 + were the most effective. When the concentration of both external Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + was reduced to micromolar amounts, depolarizing <b>photoresponses</b> were observed. In these conditions measurements with radioactive tracers showed a light-modulated efflux of 42 K+ or 86 Rb+. The light-modulated 42 K+ or 86 Rb+ efflux was halved by 2 X 6 mM-external K+ and was completely blocked when K+ was raised above 10 mM. These results show that ionic movements through light-sensitive channels are controlled by Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + and possibly also be the intracellular level of cyclic nucleotides. Moreover, the movement of ions through the light-sensitive channel, does not obey the independence principle...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of free-swimming Rhodobacter sphaeroides to increases and decreases in {{the intensity of}} light of different wavelengths was analyzed. There was a transient (1 to 2 s) increase in swimming speed {{in response to an}} increase in light intensity, and there was a similar transient stop when the light intensity decreased. Measurement of changes in membrane potential and the use of electron transport inhibitors showed that the transient increase in swimming speed, following an increase in light intensity, and the stop following its decrease were the result of changes in photosynthetic electron transport. R. sphaeroides has two operons coding for multiple homologs of the enteric chemosensory genes. Mutants in the first chemosensory operon showed wild-type <b>photoresponses.</b> Mutants with the cheA gene of the second operon (cheAII) deleted, either with or without the first operon present, showed inverted <b>photoresponses,</b> with free-swimming cells stopping on an increase in light intensity and increasing swimming speed on a decrease. These mutants also lacked adaptation. Transposon mutants with mutations in cheAII, which also reduced expression of downstream genes, however, showed no <b>photoresponses.</b> These results show that (i) free-swimming cells respond to both an increase and a decrease in light intensity (tethered cells only show the stopping on a step down in light intensity), (ii) the signal comes from photosynthetic electron transfer, and (iii) the signal is primarily channelled through the second chemosensory pathway. The different responses shown by the cheAII deletion and insertion mutants suggest that CheWII is required for <b>photoresponses,</b> and a third sensory pathway can substitute for CheAII as long as CheWII is present. The inverted response suggests that transducers are involved in <b>photoresponses</b> as well as chemotactic responses...|$|R

The effects of larger changes in light intensity were also investigated. After light-on there was a steady outward change of membrane current, and after light-off the current recovered to the initial dark level.

Phototransistors are important devices: the first with a MoS2 monolayer active region shows a photoresponsivity of 7.5 mA Wâˆ’1 which is similar to graphene devices that reach 6.1 mA Wâˆ’1. Multilayer MoS2 show higher photoresponsivities, about 100 mA Wâˆ’1, which is similar to silicon devices.

The white colonies produced ascospores and a deep red, water soluble reverse pigment. Incubation in white light lead to the largest colony diameter while green light lead to the greatest pigment production. The varying concentrations suggests pigment loss, possibly explained by nutrient depletion induced enzymatic breakdown of pigments - a common phenomena where secondary metabolites are degraded by enzymes.
