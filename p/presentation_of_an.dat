5|$|Johnson {{served as}} Vice President from March 4, 1837, to March 4, 1841. His term was largely unremarkable, and he enjoyed little {{influence}} with President Van Buren. His penchant for wielding his power {{for his own}} interests did not abate. He lobbied the Senate to promote Samuel Milroy, whom he owed a favor, {{to the position of}} Indian agent. When Lewis Tappan requested <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> abolitionist petition to the Senate, Johnson, who was still a slaveholder, declined the request.|$|E

In December 2005 the Waitangi Tribunal released their findings supporting the claim, but in October 2006 the New Zealand Minister of Defence announced that the award could not be made as King George VI had ruled in 1949 that no further awards from the Second World War ought to be made. Instead, {{it was decided that}} Manahi would be recognised by the <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> altar cloth, a personal letter from Queen Elizabeth II acknowledging his gallantry and a sword. The award was presented to Manahi's son by The Duke of York on 17 March 2007 at a ceremony in Rotorua.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after the}} killing, some {{commentators}} identified {{the possibility of}} a Yugoslav or Serb connection. At George's first trial, his defence barrister, Michael Mansfield QC, quoted from a National Criminal Intelligence Service report which stated that the Serbian warlord leader Arkan had ordered Dando's assassination in retaliation for the NATO bombing of the Radio Television of Serbia headquarters on 23 April 1999. Sixteen station staff had died in the bombing. Mansfield suggested that Dando's earlier <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> appeal for aid for Kosovar Albanian refugees may have attracted the attention of Bosnian-Serb hardliners.|$|E
25|$|Upshaw–Schulman {{syndrome}} (USS) is the recessively inherited form of {{thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura}} (TTP), a {{rare and}} complex blood coagulation disease. USS {{is caused by the}} absence of the ADAMTS13 protease resulting in the persistence of ultra large von Willebrand factor multimers (ULVWF), causing episodes of acute thrombotic microangiopathy with disseminated multiple small vessel obstructions. These obstructions deprive downstream tissues from blood and oxygen, which can result in tissue damage and death. The <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acute USS episode is variable but usually associated with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) with schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear, fever and signs of ischemic organ damage in the brain, kidney and heart.|$|E

The moratorium was repealed, at a meeting on January 23, after a predominantly negative community reaction. Shortly thereafter, the school board in Yakima, Washington, calling the film a [...] "controversial issue", prevented the Environmental Club of Eisenhower High School from showing it, pending review by the school board, teachers, principal, and parents. It lifted the stay a month later, upon the approval by a review panel.|$|E
500|$|Major General Thomas Hardwicke’s 1821 <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{article titled}} [...] "Description {{of a new}} Genus of the Class Mammalia, from the Himalaya Chain of Hills Between Nepaul and the Snowy Mountains" [...] at the Linnean Society in London is usually {{regarded}} as the moment the red panda became a bona fide species in Western science. Hardwicke proposed the name [...] "wha" [...] and explained: [...] "It is frequently discovered by its loud cry or call, resembling the word ‘Wha’, often repeating the same: hence is derived {{one of the local}} names by which it is known. It is also called Chitwa." [...] Hardwicke's paper was not published until 1827, by which time Frédéric Cuvier had published his description and a figure. Hardwicke's originally proposed taxonomic name was removed from the 1827 publication of his paper with his permission, and naming credit is now given to Cuvier.|$|E
500|$|Finally, in 2000, Manahi's iwi, Te Arawa, lodged a claim {{with the}} Waitangi Tribunal, and was {{supported}} in doing so by the New Zealand RSA. [...] Te Arawa alleged {{the failure of the}} New Zealand government to give full consideration of the award of a VC to Manahi constituted a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi, which required the government to act in good faith regarding grievances of Māori. [...] In December 2005 the tribunal reported that there was no breach of the treaty. [...] While not making any formal conclusions or recommendations, the tribunal suggested that the Manahi VC Committee work with the New Zealand government in making an approach to Buckingham Palace. [...] In October 2006, after further dialogue with Buckingham Palace, the New Zealand Minister of Defence, Phil Goff, announced that Manahi would be recognised by the <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> altar cloth, a personal letter from the Queen acknowledging his gallantry and a sword. [...] The award was presented by Prince Andrew to Manahi's sons, Rauawa and Geoffrey, at a ceremony in Rotorua on 17 March 2007. [...] The sword was later presented to the Chief of the New Zealand Defence Force, Lieutenant General Jerry Mateparae, along with a patu (war club) in memory of Haane Manahi.|$|E

500|$|Forty-eight {{hours after}} being {{uploaded}} onto YouTube, the video had been viewed 266,000 times. After a week, {{the number of}} hits had risen to over one million. Within {{two weeks of the}} Thriller video being uploaded, it had been viewed by some three million YouTube users. The following week, the number had almost doubled, coming close to six million hits. On average, the clip received 300,000 views per day at its peak. The video generated mixed reviews, with some critics claiming that Garcia forced the inmates to perform, an accusation the prisoners refuted. Several of the inmates showed devotion towards their prison chief, with as many as 20 prisoners bearing tattoos with Garcia's name. Garcia's concept of having prisoners dance as part of a rehabilitation program has been copied by several prisons, including jails in Quezon province and Muntinlupa. Garcia commented that the movie showed that dancing is not a cruel or unusual punishment. He claimed that his prison showed that negative inmates could be turned into positive individuals, through the concept of a [...] "revolutionized penology". Following Garcia's <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inmate performance at the province's Founding Day celebrations, a donation of $35,000 was given to the prison. Each inmate received $22 of the gift, deposited into a prison passbook account. The remaining money went to the Cebu province and its employees, to defray the costs of incarceration.|$|E
