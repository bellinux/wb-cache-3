5|$|A {{separate}} device {{known as}} the combo preamp is necessary to connect a vintage Leslie to another instrument such as a guitar. This combines a separate AC input and line level input onto a single amphenol connector, and provide a footswitch to select between the speeds of the Leslie. Modern products such as the Trek II UC-1A allow any instrument with a <b>phone</b> <b>jack</b> connection to {{use a variety of}} Leslie speakers.|$|E
25|$|Since {{equipment}} {{often requires}} an input on a TRS <b>phone</b> <b>jack</b> or an XLR connector, Neutrik and Amphenol offer several models of combination connector that accept both XLR and 0.25inch TS or TRS phone plugs.|$|E
2500|$|Headphones {{are made}} {{in a range of}} {{different}} audio reproduction quality capabilities. [...] Headsets designed for telephone use typically cannot reproduce sound with the high fidelity of expensive units designed for music listening by audiophiles. [...] Headphones that use cables typically have either a 1/4 inch (6.35mm) or 1/8 inch (3.5mm) <b>phone</b> <b>jack</b> for plugging the headphones into the audio source. Some stereo earbuds are wireless, using Bluetooth connectivity to transmit the audio signal by radio waves from source devices like cellphones and digital players. [...] Due to the spread of wireless devices in recent years headphones are increasingly used by people in public places such as sidewalks, grocery stores, and public transit. [...] Headphones are also used by people in various professional contexts, such as audio engineers mixing sound for live concerts or sound recordings and DJs, who use headphones to cue up the next song they will play without the audience hearing, aircraft pilots and call center employees. The latter two types of employees use headphones with an integrated microphone.|$|E

5000|$|Consumer {{electronic}} devices concerned with audio (for example sound cards) {{often have a}} connector labeled line in and/or line out. Line out provides an audio signal output and line in receives a signal input. The line in/out connections on consumer-oriented audio equipment are typically unbalanced, with a 3.5 mm (0.14 inch, but commonly called [...] "eighth inch") 3-conductor TRS minijack connector providing ground, left channel, and right channel, or stereo RCA jacks. Professional equipment commonly uses balanced connections on 6.35 mm (1/4 inch) TRS <b>phone</b> <b>jacks</b> or XLR connectors. Professional equipment may also use unbalanced connections with (1/4 inch) TS <b>phone</b> <b>jacks.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{output of}} most {{microphones}} is balanced {{to reduce the}} pickup of electrical noise, and therefore requires two signal wires and an earth per channel. This necessitates the use of three-pin connectors. To reduce noise, the shields of each channel are often isolated from the other channels. <b>phone</b> <b>jacks</b> may be used instead of XLRs.|$|R

50|$|Early speaker cable was {{typically}} stranded copper wire, insulated with cloth tape, waxed paper or rubber. For portable applications, common lampcord was used, twisted in pairs for mechanical reasons. Cables were often soldered {{in place at}} one end. Other terminations were binding posts, terminal strips, and spade lugs for crimp connections. Two-conductor ¼-inch tip-sleeve <b>phone</b> <b>jacks</b> came into use in the 1920s and '30s as convenient terminations.|$|R
50|$|The Modified Modular Jack (MMJ) {{is a small}} {{form-factor}} {{serial port}} connector developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). It uses {{a modified version of}} the 6P6C modular connector with the latch displaced off-center so standard modular connectors found on Ethernet cables or <b>phone</b> <b>jacks</b> cannot accidentally be plugged in. MMJ connections are used on Digital minicomputers, such as the PDP-11, VAX and Alpha systems, and to connect terminals, printers, and serial console servers.|$|R
5000|$|TASCAM used DB25 {{connectors}} {{for their}} multi-track recording audio equipment (TDIF), and Logitek Audio later {{did the same}} for its broadcast consoles, though with different pinouts. [...] Roland used DB25 connectors for their multi-track recording audio equipment (R-BUS). A few patch panels have been made which have the DB25 connectors on the back with <b>phone</b> <b>jacks</b> (or even TRS phone connectors) on the front, however these are normally wired for TASCAM, which is more common outside of broadcasting.|$|R

50|$|A {{thriving}} {{3rd party}} market for AppleTalk devices {{developed over the}} next few years. One particularly notable example was an alternate adaptor designed by BMUG and commercialized by Farallon as PhoneNet in 1987. This was essentially a replacement for Apple's connector that had conventional <b>phone</b> <b>jacks</b> instead of Apple's round connectors. PhoneNet allowed AppleTalk networks to be connected together using normal telephone wires, and with very little extra work, could run analog phones and AppleTalk on a single four-conductor phone cable.|$|R
5000|$|Common {{connectors}} {{used with}} balanced circuits include modular connectors on telephone instruments and broadband data, and XLR connectors for professional audio. 1/4" [...] tip/ring/sleeve (TRS) phone connectors were once widely used on manual switchboards and other telephone infrastructure. Such connectors {{are now more}} commonly seen in miniature sizes (2.5 and 3.5 mm) being used for unbalanced stereo audio; however, professional audio equipment such as mixing consoles still commonly use balanced and unbalanced [...] "line-level" [...] connections with 1/4" [...] <b>phone</b> <b>jacks.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In 1992 Fender {{introduced}} the '65 Reissue, with blackface cosmetics and circuitry, an output rating of 85W RMS and 8Ω Jensen C-12K speakers. It should be noted, however, that the '65 Reissue is constructed with {{a printed circuit}} board and new 1/4" [...] <b>phone</b> <b>jacks</b> for the footswitch pedal replacing the older RCA design of the vintage originals. Fender's original intention was to issue only 300 of this model, but it was continued due to its success in the market.
