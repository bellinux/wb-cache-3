40|$|Two-phase {{flow pattern}} data have been {{obtained}} experimentally for R- 407 C flowing inside 12 mm bore sight glasses, which were located at the outlets of 3 m long, <b>plain</b> <b>bore</b> copper tube heat transfer test sections. The tests covered nominal mass velocities of 100, 200 and 300 kg/m 2 s, vapor qualities from 5 - 95 %, and {{a wide range of}} heat fluxes, all taken at a fixed inlet saturation pressure of 6. 45 bar to the evaporator test section. The flow pattern data were compared to the newly developed two-phase frow pattern map of Kattan, Thome and Favrat (1997) and Kattan (1996). The flow pattern map covers both adiabatic flows and diabatic flows for evaporating refrigerants, including the prediction of the onset of dryout {{at the top of the}} tube in the annular flow regime as a function of heat flux. This flow pattern map, formerly developed from a database for R- 123, R- 134 a, R- 502, R- 402 A and R- 404 A, accurately predicted the new flow pattern data and the onset of dryout of R- 407 C without modification...|$|E

40|$|This paper evaluates two {{different}} journal bearings: a cylindrical <b>bore</b> <b>plain</b> journal bearing and a tri-lobe taper land bearing. Each bearing {{has the same}} nominal diameter (89 mm) and aspect ratio (L/D = 0. 7). The shaft rotational speed ranged from 6 krpm to 14 krpm and the bearing specific load from 700 kPa to 2800 kPa. The bearings' steady-state performance is evaluated according to relative bearing and shaft displacement, bearing operating temperature and power loss. A frequency-domain analysis is used to determine bearing rotordynamic coefficients - it treats the bearing as a mass-spring-damper system. Excitation frequencies range between 20 Hz and 350 Hz. Ultimately, the tri-lobe taper land bearing offers better stability whereas the cylindrical <b>bore</b> <b>plain</b> journal bearing has a lower eccentricity and runs cooler for a given operating condition.

The Rabinowitsch fluid model has been employed herein for simulating the non-Newtonian rheology of lubricant and Reynolds equation is developed accordingly. The performance parameters (load carrying capacity, coefficient of friction, and stability) of bearing have been investigated and discussed herein in terms of ellipticity (of bearing bore) and non-linearity parameter (relating the non-Newtonian rheology). The combined effects of shear thinning of the lubricant and increase in the ellipticity of the bearing bore cause reduction in the load carrying capacity and increase in friction coefficient in comparison to <b>plain</b> circular <b>bore</b> journal bearing lubricated with Newtonian lubricant.

40|$|Abstract Introduction/background: Teaching {{statistics}} to medical students is hampered in two ways. Firstly, as a “Cinderella” subject, statistics {{is perceived to}} be less glamorous than other apparently more clinical disciplines. Secondly, as it involves mathematics students often view it as difficult, unpleasant or just <b>plain</b> <b>boring.</b> Since 2005, first and second year medical students, undertaking the new integrated undergraduate medical curriculum at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, have been learning medical statistics and evidence-based medicine (EBM) through a mainly online learning environment of nine consecutive online modules supported by lectures and practicals). Issues for exploration/ideas for discussion: This paper examines numeracy issues and threshold concepts as impediments to learning medical statistics and EBM and shows how online learning and support activities can be adapted to target these problematic areas. Purpose/objectives: Early feedback on the online statistics modules revealed that there was a problem with student engagement and also poor understanding of the major assessed topic areas. In an attempt to improve the modules, the impediments to student engagement and learning were identified. Prominent among these problem areas were major threshold concepts and also any content containing mathematics or formulae. Further research aimed to find a more engaging and successful way to approach these problem areas from both teaching and learning points of view. Sections in the modules with major threshold concepts and statistical formulae were redesigned to present information using more than one teaching approach (visual and narrative as well as mathematical) and by targeting online exercises and quizzes, lectures and face to face tutorials on hese more difficult areas. Several other changes were also implemented to support these initiatives, including a more comprehensive evaluation. Results: Subsequent evaluation using online evaluation forms, quiz and exam results revealed that the students’ knowledge in the targeted areas improved and that student engagement in the course had increased considerably. Discussion: The significance of these findings for other “Cinderella” subjects and for online statistical courses is discussed and suggestions are made for the application of this process to other areas of learning. However, the overall impact of changes is difficult to assess as numeracy issues involve emotional responses that are difficult to gauge and the measurement of student understanding of threshold concepts is complex and maximal evaluation remains elusive...|$|R
