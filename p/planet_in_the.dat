5|$|The {{discovery}} of HD 154672's planet {{was reported in}} the Astronomical Journal on October 7, 2008 along with a <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> orbit of HD 205739.|$|E
5|$|Earth's axis of {{rotation}} is tilted, producing seasonal variations on the planet's surface. The gravitational interaction between the Earth and Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes the Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System and {{the largest of the}} four terrestrial planets.|$|E
5|$|Gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, are giant planets {{primarily}} {{composed of}} {{hydrogen and helium}} and are the most massive planets in the Solar System.

5|$|Planet Nine is a {{hypothetical}} large <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> far outer Solar System, the gravitational effects {{of which would}} explain the improbable orbital configuration {{of a group of}} trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) that orbit mostly beyond the Kuiper belt.|$|E
5|$|Terrestrials: Planets {{that are}} similar to Earth, with bodies largely {{composed}} of rock: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.

5|$|The initial study {{into the}} system {{suggests}} that a second <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner system is unlikely. The discoverers of GJ 3634 b, however, noted the signal of a secondary body of an unknown nature that most likely orbits GJ 3634 every 200 days with a mass that is at most double that of Neptune.|$|E
50|$|All <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System {{have now}} been visited to varying degrees by {{spacecraft}} launched from Earth.

25|$|Studies {{that have}} {{attempted}} to estimate the number of terrestrial planets within the circumstellar habitable zone tend to reflect the availability of scientific data. A 2013 study by Ravi Kumar Kopparapu put ηe, the fraction of stars with <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> CHZ, at 0.48, meaning {{that there may be}} roughly 95–180 billion habitable <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Milky Way. However, this is merely a statistical prediction; {{only a small fraction of}} these possible planets have yet been discovered.|$|R
50|$|André Patry (22 November 1902 - 20 June 1960) was a French {{astronomer}} and discoverer of 9 minor <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1930s.|$|R
5|$|The team {{released}} a paper of their findings dated April 27, 2007, {{published in the}} July 2007 journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. At the time of discovery, it {{was reported to be}} the first potentially Earth-like <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> habitable zone of its star and the smallest known extrasolar planet around a main-sequence star but on April 21, 2009, another planet orbiting Gliese 581, Gliese 581e, with an approximate mass of 1.9 Earth masses, was announced. In the paper, they also announced the discovery of another <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system, Gliese 581d, with a minimum mass of 7.7 Earth masses and a semi-major axis of 0.25 astronomical units.|$|E
5|$|While most planets with orbital {{periods of}} less than 10 days have almost {{circular}} orbits, HD 217107 b has a somewhat eccentric orbit, and its discoverers hypothesized {{that this could be}} due to the gravitational influence of a second <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system at a distance of several astronomical units (AU). Confirmation of the existence of a second planet, HD 217107 c, followed in 2005.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, Olbers was again {{attempting}} to locate Ceres {{when he noticed}} another moving object in the vicinity. This was the asteroid Pallas, coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time. The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community. Before this point it had been speculated by astronomers {{that there should be}} a <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gap between Mars and Jupiter. Now, unexpectedly, a second such body had been found. When Pallas was discovered, some estimates of its size were as high as 3,380km in diameter. Even as recently as 1979, Pallas was estimated to be 673km in diameter, 26% greater than the currently accepted value.|$|E
50|$|If {{a planet}} has an {{eccentric}} orbit, then tidal heating can provide {{another source of}} energy besides stellar radiation. This means that eccentric <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> radiative habitable zone can be too hot for liquid water (Tidal Venus). Tides also circularize orbits over time so there could be <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> habitable zone with circular orbits that have no water because {{they used to have}} eccentric orbits. Eccentric planets further out than the habitable zone would still have frozen surfaces but the tidal heating could create a subsurface ocean similar to Europa's. In some planetary systems, such as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upsilon Andromedae system, the eccentricity of orbits is maintained or even periodically varied by perturbations from other <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system. Tidal heating can cause outgassing from the mantle, contributing to the formation and replenishment of an atmosphere.|$|R

5|$|A third {{suggested}} alignment {{was some}} sort of planetary conjunction occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date. Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth. Jupiter is the largest <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System; larger than all other planets combined. When Jupiter is near opposition, the difference in gravitational force that the Earth experiences is less than 1% of the force that the Earth feels daily from the Moon.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} of Pluto's orbit by Matthew J. Holman and Matthew J. Payne found perturbations {{much larger than}} predicted by Batygin and Brown's proposed orbit for Planet Nine. Holman and Payne suggested three possible explanations: systematic errors in the measurements of Pluto's orbit; an unmodeled mass in the Solar System, such as a small <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range of 60– (potentially explaining the Kuiper cliff); or a planet more massive or closer to the Sun instead of the planet predicted by Batygin and Brown.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers use three {{different}} systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn. SystemI has {{a period of}} 10hr 14min 00sec (844.3°/d) and encompasses the Equatorial Zone, the South Equatorial Belt and the North Equatorial Belt. The polar regions are considered to have rotation rates similar to SystemI. All other Saturnian latitudes, excluding {{the north and south}} polar regions, are indicated as SystemII and have been assigned a rotation period of 10hr 38min 25.4sec (810.76°/d). SystemIII refers to Saturn's internal rotation rate. Based on radio emissions from the <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> period of the Voyager flybys, it has been assigned a rotation period of 10hr 39min 22.4sec (810.8°/d). Because it is close to SystemII, it has largely superseded it.|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} terrestrial-type planet {{formation}} during the post oligarchic growth, the initial distributions of planetary embryos and planetesimals used in N-body simulations {{play an important}} role. Most of these studies typically use ad hoc initial distributions based on theoretical and numerical studies. We analyze the formation of planetary systems without gas giants around solar-type stars focusing on {{the sensitivity of the}} results to the particular initial distributions of planetesimals and embryos. The formation of terrestrial <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> habitable zone (HZ) and their final water contents are topics of interest. We developed two different sets of N-body simulations from the same protoplanetary disk. The first set assumes ad hoc initial distributions for embryos and planetesimals and the second set obtains these distributions from the results of a semi-analytical model which simulates the evolution of the gaseous phase of the disk. Both sets form <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HZ. Ad hoc initial conditions form <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HZ with masses from 0. 66 M_⊕ to 2. 27 M_⊕. More realistic initial conditions obtained from a semi-analytical model, form planets with masses between 1. 18 M_⊕ and 2. 21 M_⊕. Both sets form <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HZ with water contents between 4. 5...|$|R
25|$|Tycho Brahe (1546–1601) made {{extensive}} and more accurate naked eye observations of <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 16th century. These became the basic data for Kepler's studies.|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that gravitational lensing {{can be used}} to discover and study <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> habitable zones of nearby dwarf stars. If appropriate software is developed, a new generation of monitoring programs will automatically conduct a census of nearby <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> habitable zones of dwarf stars. In addition, individual nearby dwarf stars can produce lensing events at predictable times; careful monitoring of these events can discover any <b>planets</b> located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> zone of habitability. Because lensing can discover <b>planets</b> (1) <b>in</b> face-on orbits, and (2) <b>in</b> orbit around <b>the</b> dimmest stars, lensing techniques will provide complementary information to that gleaned through Doppler and/or transit investigations. The ultimate result will be a comprehensive understanding of the variety of systems with conditions similar to those that gave rise to life on Earth. 1. Introduction: Lensin...|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of discovery, Gliese 876 was already known to host an extrasolar planet {{designated}} Gliese 876 b. In 2001, further analysis of the star's radial velocity revealed {{the existence of a}} second <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system, which was designated Gliese 876 c. The orbital period of Gliese 876 c was found to be exactly half that of the outer planet, which meant that the radial velocity signature of the second planet was initially interpreted as a higher eccentricity of the orbit of Gliese 876 b.|$|E
5|$|Because Neptune {{is not a}} solid body, its {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The wide {{equatorial zone}} rotates with {{a period of about}} 18hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System, and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.|$|E
5|$|Data and Picard {{discover}} a submerged and cloaked Federation ship containing a gigantic holodeck {{set up to}} recreate the Ba'ku village. Data's malfunction stems from a Son'a attack, received when he discovered the vessel. Picard confronts Dougherty and learns that top Federation officers and the Son'a secretly planned to deceptively move the Ba'ku to the ship and forcibly relocate them to another planet, allowing the Son'a to collect the rejuvenating radiation (but poisoning the <b>planet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process). Dougherty orders the Enterprise to leave. Picard states the rejuvenation benefit of the radiation does not justify Dougherty's plans for the Ba'ku and violates the Prime Directive. He plans to alert the Federation of the forced relocation.|$|E
25|$|The Moon {{is unusual}} because <b>the</b> other rocky <b>planets</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System either have no {{satellites}} (Mercury and Venus), or have tiny satellites that are probably captured asteroids (Mars).|$|R
