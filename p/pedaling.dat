5|$|To learn whether errors {{actually}} {{existed in}} Lilienthal's data tables, the brothers used a bicycle {{for a new}} type of experiment. They made a model-size airfoil and a counter-acting flat plate, both according to dimensions Lilienthal had specified, and attached them to an extra bicycle wheel, which they mounted horizontally in front of the handlebars. <b>Pedaling</b> strenuously on a local street to create airflow over the apparatus, they observed that the third wheel rotated against the airfoil instead of remaining motionless as Lilienthal's formula predicted. The experiment confirmed their suspicion that either the standard Smeaton coefficient or Lilienthal's coefficients of lift and drag–or all of them–were in error.|$|E
5|$|Even when staying {{relatively}} motionless, a rider can {{balance a}} bike {{by the same}} principle. While performing a track stand, the rider can keep {{the line between the}} two contact patches under the combined center of mass by steering the front wheel to {{one side or the other}} and then moving forward and backward slightly to move the front contact patch from side to side as necessary. Forward motion can be generated simply by <b>pedaling.</b> Backwards motion can be generated the same way on a fixed-gear bicycle. Otherwise, the rider can take advantage of an opportune slope of the pavement or lurch the upper body backwards while the brakes are momentarily engaged.|$|E
5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to <b>pedaling,</b> the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E

50|$|The special <b>pedal</b> cranks allowed both <b>pedals</b> to {{be rotated}} forward so that the <b>pedals</b> would form motorcycle-style {{footrests}} in normal operation. To engage the <b>pedals,</b> the left-hand <b>pedal</b> crank could be rotated forward and locked and a drive gear engaged allowing the user to <b>pedal.</b> A short chain connected the <b>pedal</b> drive to the main engine-chain drive system. <b>Pedalling</b> was hard work for the rider: there was no freewheel and the <b>pedal</b> gearing was very low. The engine could be started with <b>pedal</b> drive engaged, causing the <b>pedals</b> to rotate under engine power when the bike was in gear. In practice, the cam and shaft arrangement to engage the <b>pedals</b> frequently seized (in normal operation, a rider would very rarely engage pedal-drive as it was less tiring to push than to <b>pedal).</b>|$|R
50|$|Pianos {{have had}} <b>pedals,</b> or some close equivalent, since the {{earliest}} days. (In the 18th century, some pianos used levers pressed upward by the player's knee instead of <b>pedals.)</b> Most grand pianos in the US have three pedals: the soft <b>pedal</b> (una corda), sostenuto, and sustain <b>pedal</b> (from left to right, respectively), while in Europe, the standard is two pedals: the soft <b>pedal</b> and the sustain <b>pedal.</b> Most modern upright pianos also have three pedals: soft <b>pedal,</b> practice <b>pedal</b> and sustain <b>pedal,</b> though older or cheaper models may lack the practice <b>pedal.</b> In Europe {{the standard for}} upright pianos is two pedals: the soft and the sustain <b>pedals.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{chain drive}} {{improved}} comfort and speed, as the drive {{was transferred to}} the non-steering rear wheel and allowed for smooth, relaxed and injury free <b>pedaling</b> (earlier designs that required pedalling the steering front wheel were difficult to pedal while turning, due to the misalignment of rotational planes of leg and pedal). With easier <b>pedaling,</b> the rider more easily turned corners.|$|E
25|$|Riding fixed is {{considered}} by some to encourage a more effective <b>pedaling</b> style, which it is claimed translates into greater efficiency and power when used on a bicycle fitted with a freewheel. It allows for the rider to engage in and practice proper cadence, which is the balanced and rhythmic flow of <b>pedaling,</b> enhancing performance for both cyclist and bicycle.|$|E
25|$|On tandem {{bicycles}} the pedalling {{contribution of}} both riders is often combined and coordinated by the crank arms. There {{may be a}} second set of chainrings, often on the opposite side from the regular drive train, one on each crank set and connected by a separate chain. The most common implementation has both cyclists <b>pedaling</b> at exactly the same pace and usually in phase, although it is possible to configure the system for out-of-phase <b>pedaling.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A sustain <b>pedal</b> or {{sustaining}} <b>pedal</b> (also called damper <b>pedal,</b> loud <b>pedal,</b> or open <b>pedal)</b> is {{the most}} commonly used <b>pedal</b> in a modern piano. It is typically the rightmost of two or three <b>pedals.</b> When pressed, the sustain <b>pedal</b> [...] "sustains" [...] all the damped strings on the piano by moving all the dampers away from the strings and allowing them to vibrate freely. All notes played will continue to sound until the vibration naturally ceases, or until the <b>pedal</b> is released.|$|R
50|$|A double <b>pedal</b> is two <b>pedal</b> tones played simultaneously.An {{inverted}} <b>pedal</b> is a <b>pedal</b> {{that is not}} in {{the bass}} (and often is the highest part.) Mozart included numerous inverted <b>pedals</b> in his works, particularly in the solo parts of his concertos. An internal <b>pedal</b> is a <b>pedal</b> that is similar to the inverted <b>pedal,</b> except that it is played in the middle register between the bass and the upper voices.|$|R
50|$|Piano <b>pedals</b> are {{foot-operated}} levers at {{the base}} of a piano which change the instrument's sound in various ways. Modern pianos usually have three <b>pedals,</b> from left to right, the soft <b>pedal</b> (or una corda), the sostenuto <b>pedal,</b> and the sustaining <b>pedal</b> (or damper <b>pedal).</b> Some pianos omit the sostenuto <b>pedal,</b> or have a middle <b>pedal</b> with a different purpose such as a muting function also known as silent piano.|$|R
25|$|There are tandem cranksets {{available}} called independent <b>pedaling</b> system cranksets, {{which allow}} each cyclist to pedal, or not, {{at their own}} pace.|$|E

25|$|As {{opposed to}} {{rickshaw}}s pulled {{by a person}} on foot, cycle rickshaws are human-powered by <b>pedaling.</b> Another type of rickshaw is the auto rickshaw.|$|E
50|$|The {{tire changer}} has two foot <b>pedals.</b> The left <b>pedal</b> {{is called the}} clamp control <b>pedal,</b> a three {{position}} <b>pedal</b> that opens and closes the rim clamps. Once pressed, pneumatic pistons move the 4 rim clamps together or apart simultaneously. The right <b>pedal</b> is the table top <b>pedal,</b> which is a three position <b>pedal</b> that controls {{the rotation of the}} table top. When the table top <b>pedal</b> is pressed down, the table top spins clockwise. The table top spins counter clockwise when the <b>pedal</b> is raised.|$|R
50|$|Boss's line of compact <b>pedals</b> {{began in}} 1977 {{with the release}} of six <b>pedals,</b> all of them discontinued: an {{overdrive}} <b>pedal</b> (OD-1), a phaser <b>pedal</b> (PH-1), a parametric equalizer called the Spectrum (SP-1), a 6-band graphic equalizer (GE-6), a compressor <b>pedal</b> (CS-1) and an automatic wah <b>pedal</b> (TW-1). The Boss DS-1 was released the next year, in 1978. Their first compact chorus <b>pedal</b> (CE-2) came in 1979, and their first flanger <b>pedal</b> (BF-2) in 1980. In 1983 Boss released the DD-2 Digital Delay, the first mass-produced digital delay in a compact <b>pedal</b> format. The Metal Zone (MT-2) was released in 1991. In 1992 Boss released nine new <b>pedals,</b> including the Turbo Distortion (DS-2). The Heavy Metal (HM-2) distortion <b>pedal</b> {{was an integral part of}} the guitar sound of many styles of heavy metal music ever since. The <b>pedals</b> all share the same 'footprint', for compatibility with <b>pedal</b> boards.|$|R
50|$|The crescendo <b>pedal</b> is {{typically}} used only in certain repertoire, and, generally speaking, the organ's expression <b>pedal(s)</b> are more commonly used. Because the crescendo <b>pedal</b> both resembles and is {{adjacent to the}} expression <b>pedal(s),</b> it may confuse beginning organists, such as pianists who are filling in at the church organ, who intend to use the expression <b>pedal(s)</b> rather than the crescendo <b>pedal.</b> To avoid this danger, the organist should look at the <b>pedals</b> before playing to ascertain if they are labeled, as well as practice locating the correct <b>pedal</b> by feel. When feeling for a <b>pedal</b> while playing, the organist should remember that the crescendo <b>pedal</b> is normally the right-most of the volume <b>pedals,</b> and that its surface is often raised slightly above the expression <b>pedal(s)</b> so as to help the organist to avoid selecting it by mistake.|$|R
25|$|Currently, {{two billion}} {{bicycles}} are in use around the world. Children, students, professionals, laborers, civil servants and seniors are <b>pedaling</b> around their communities. They all experience {{the freedom and}} the natural opportunity for exercise that the bicycle easily provides. Bicycle also has lowest carbon intensity of travel.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} obvious {{disadvantage}} {{is the lack of}} multiple gears, and the flexibility in <b>pedaling</b> cadence and resistance made available through gear shifting. Hilly or uneven mountainous terrain with steep grades can be particularly challenging, as the rider cannot adjust the gearing to match the terrain.|$|E
25|$|In another damper technique—half pedaling—the player {{depresses}} {{the pedal}} {{just enough to}} remove the spring pressure from the bars, {{but not enough to}} make the pad lose contact with the bars. This lets the bars ring slightly longer than with the pad fully up and can make a medium-fast passage sound more legato without <b>pedaling</b> every note.|$|E
50|$|Rogers uses an {{overdrive}} <b>pedal</b> and a tremolo <b>pedal,</b> {{the latter}} custom made by Colin Bloxom, {{as well as}} a wah <b>pedal</b> and, occasionally, a Route 66 overdrive/compression <b>pedal.</b> Rogers also uses an overdrive <b>pedal</b> that was built by Ramblin' Guitars.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pedal</b> {{curve is}} {{the first in a series}} of curves C1, C2, C3, etc., where C1 is the <b>pedal</b> of C, C2 is the <b>pedal</b> of C1, and so on. In this scheme, C1 is known as the first {{positive}} <b>pedal</b> of C, C2 is the second positive <b>pedal</b> of C, and so on. Going the other direction, C {{is the first}} negative <b>pedal</b> of C1, the second negative <b>pedal</b> of C2, etc.|$|R

25|$|Freewheeling {{unicycle}}, a unicycle {{in which}} the hub has a freewheel mechanism, allowing the rider, to coast or move forward without <b>pedaling,</b> as a common bicycle does. These unicycles almost always have brakes because they cannot stop the way traditional unicycles do. The brake lever is generally mounted {{in the bottom of}} the saddle. These unicycles also cannot go backwards.|$|E
25|$|This {{configuration}} {{consists of}} a left crank arm with a spider and chainring, and a right crank arm without a spider, the opposite of a normal configuration. If used with a screw-on freewheel, a special hub with a left hand thread for a special freewheel must be used , which is also threaded left hand and ratchets {{the opposite direction of}} a normal freewheel. If the freewheel and hub were threaded with right hand threads, the torque applied by <b>pedaling</b> would loosen and unthread the freewheel from the hub.|$|E
25|$|For {{a bicycle}} to travel {{at the same}} speed, using a lower gear (larger {{mechanical}} advantage) requires the rider to pedal at a faster cadence, but with less force. Conversely, a higher gear (smaller mechanical advantage) provides a higher speed for a given cadence, but requires the rider to exert greater force. Different cyclists may have different preferences for cadence and <b>pedaling</b> force. Prolonged exertion of too much force in too high a gear at too low a cadence can increase the chance of knee damage; cadence above 100 rpm becomes less effective after short bursts, as during a sprint.|$|E
5000|$|Morley <b>Pedals</b> is {{the name}} of a guitar effects <b>pedal</b> company, famous for {{manufacturing}} wah-wah <b>pedals</b> and other treadle type effects for guitar. Morley <b>pedals</b> use electro-optical circuitry rather than a potentiometer to control the effect. The foot treadle controls a shutter inside the <b>pedal</b> that in turn controls the amount of light reaching a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR). The advantage to this system is that there are no potentiometers in the signal path to wear out or become [...] "scratchy sounding" [...] over time. Electro-optical circuitry is used throughout the classic Morley <b>pedal</b> line, which includes or has included volume <b>pedals,</b> delay <b>pedals,</b> chorus and phaser <b>pedals,</b> and many others.|$|R

25|$|While, in 1893, Literatorul hosted {{fragments}} of Thalassa in its Romanian-language version, the author also launched a daily, Lumina ("The Light"). It {{was also at}} that stage that Alexandru Macedonski associated with Cincinat Pavelescu, the noted epigrammarian, who joined him in editing Literatorul, and with whom he co-authored the 1893 verse tragedy depicting the Biblical hero Saul, and named after him. Although showcased by the National Theater with star actor Constantin Nottara in the title role, it failed to register success with the public. Two years later, the two Literatorul editors made headlines as pioneers of cycling. An enthusiastic promoter of the sport, Macedonski joined fellow poet Constantin Cantilli on a marathon, <b>pedaling</b> from Bucharest {{across the border into}} Austria-Hungary, {{all the way down to}} Brașov.|$|E
25|$|Since cyclists' {{legs are}} most {{efficient}} over {{a narrow range}} of <b>pedaling</b> speeds, or cadence, a variable gear ratio helps a cyclist to maintain an optimum pedalling speed while covering varied terrain. Some, mainly utility, bicycles use hub gears with between 3 and 14 ratios, but most use the generally more efficient dérailleur system, by which the chain is moved between different cogs called chainrings and sprockets in order to select a ratio. A dérailleur system normally has two dérailleurs, or mechs, one at the front to select the chainring and another at the back to select the sprocket. Most bikes {{have two or three}} chainrings, and from 5 to 11 sprockets on the back, with the number of theoretical gears calculated by multiplying front by back. In reality, many gears overlap or require the chain to run diagonally, so the number of usable gears is fewer.|$|E
25|$|Hakim and Bet-Zuri {{ran out of}} the yard, {{jumped on}} their rented bicycles, and began <b>pedaling</b> down the street away from the scene. Major Hughes-Onslow rushed to the sentry box and raised the alarm. Hearing it, Hakim and Bet-Zuri turned onto a side street. They had very nearly gotten away when an Egyptian {{motorcycle}} policeman, El-Amin Mahomed Abdullah, caught up to them. Hakim and Bet-Zuri were determined not to injure any Egyptians in their operation, and so did not attempt to shoot him off his motorcycle. Rather, Bet-Zuri fired a volley of warning shots in his direction, which he ignored. Abdullah then dismounted and ordered him to drop his weapon. Bet-Zuri attempted to shoot out the motorcycle's tires, but found that his pistol had run out of ammunition, and as he attempted to reload it, Abdullah fired, hitting Bet-Zuri in the chest. Hearing the commotion, Hakim turned back to help Bet-Zuri, and within minutes, another policeman appeared, and the two were placed under arrest.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pedal</b> {{points are}} {{somewhat}} problematic on the harpsichord, which {{has only a}} limited sustain capability. Often the <b>pedal</b> note is simply repeated at intervals. A <b>pedal</b> tone can also be realized with a trill; this is particularly common with inverted <b>pedals.</b> Another method of producing a <b>pedal</b> point on the harpsichord is to repeat the <b>pedal</b> point note (or its octave) on every beat. The rarely seen <b>pedal</b> harpsichord, a harpsichord with a <b>pedal</b> keyboard, {{makes it easier to}} perform repeated bass notes on the harpsichord, since both hands are still free to play on the upper manual keyboards.|$|R
5000|$|Along {{with the}} {{development}} of the <b>pedals</b> on the piano came the phenomenon of the <b>pedal</b> piano, a piano with a pedalboard. Some of the early <b>pedal</b> pianos date back to 1815. [...] The <b>pedal</b> piano developed partially for organists to be able to practice <b>pedal</b> work away from the organ. In some instances, the <b>pedal</b> piano was actually a special type of piano with a built-in <b>pedal</b> board and a higher keyboard and bench, like an organ. Other times, an independent <b>pedal</b> board and set of strings could be connected to a regular grand piano.|$|R
