5|$|MTV {{reported}} in February 2008 that Summit Entertainment intended {{to create a}} series {{of at least three}} films based on Meyer's books. The studio had optioned New Moon, the second book in the series, by October 2008, and confirmed their plans to make a film based on it November 22, 2008. Because Catherine Hardwicke had wanted more <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> than Summit's schedule for the production and release of the sequel would provide, Chris Weitz was selected to direct it in December 2008.|$|E

The ballistic missiles would have been launched from vertical tubes replacing the forward turrets, and in one version, the entire main armament. The proposal was dropped because both types would have needed a fully stabilized launching platform to give them any chance of hitting their targets and that the ballistic missiles would need three hours of <b>preparation</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

40|$|Closed access. This study {{examined}} the consistency of pre-performance routines in international rugby union goal kickers on kicks of varying difficulty and under different amounts of situational pressure. Concentration <b>times</b> and physical <b>preparation</b> <b>times</b> were calculated from video recordings of the 572 place kicks taken during the 1999 Rugby Union World Cup. In contrast {{to the view that}} performers should seek consistent pre-performance routine times, the results revealed a strong positive relationship between kick difficulty and concentration time. Analysis of the effect of situational pressure, determined by the difference in score before the kick, revealed that players tended to have longer concentration times and shorter physical <b>preparation</b> <b>times</b> when the scores were close. There were no differences between the best and worst kickers in the tournament on routine time, consistency or rhythmicity. The view that increasing the temporal consistency of a routine will result in improved performance is challenged...|$|R

However, most of these methods require long <b>preparation</b> <b>times</b> (several hours or a day), involve multiple steps and have high thermal costs, which often result in structural damage in the MWCNTs. Thus, {{there is a need}} to develop an easier and faster method for their synthesis.|$|R
5|$|To the north, the New Zealand Rifle Brigade {{suffered}} {{the attention of}} German artillery even before beginning to move forward at 1:00 am. The attack did not begin until 6:30 am, when three battalions of riflemen began advancing. There had been no time to arrange a covering barrage {{and there was no}} armoured support. Despite heavy machine gun fire, all three battalions made their initial objectives but made little progress beyond these due to the strongly defended villages of St. Aubin and Beugnâtre, both to the northeast of Bapaume. Beugnâtre had been thought to have been captured by the 5th Division and thus the German presence in the village was unexpected. By 10:00 am, the attack had petered out and the battalions were consolidating their positions, during which they had to fend off a counterattack from Beugnâtre. On short notice, a further attack was arranged for the evening with the aim of pushing forward to the road to Cambrai, this time with a supporting artillery barrage. The 3rd Rifle Battalion of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, in a salient between Bapaume and St. Aubin, was to test the defences of the town with fighting patrols. The 2nd Rifle Battalion was to flank St. Aubin and advance for the Cambrai Road alongside 4th Rifle Battalion, which would also link up with 5th Division, which had the task of taking Beugnâtre. However, instructions to the attacking battalions were issued late and several companies did not receive their orders until the barrage had already commenced. Brigadier General Herbert Hart, commanding the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, realising the inadequacy of the <b>preparation</b> <b>time,</b> tried to cancel the operation but to no avail. Despite this, Beugnâtre did fall to the British; advancing under a covering barrage, the King's Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB) penetrated the village relatively easily before encountering strong machine gun. Even so, the KOSB pushed the Germans out and this secured the outer flank of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade. However, while the New Zealanders did reach the Cambrai road, they were unable to hold it and had to settle for securing the railway line to Cambrai instead, this line being a little {{to the west of the}} road. St. Aubin was also captured by the 2nd Rifle Battalion.|$|E
25|$|As {{cards are}} read in round, {{it is common}} for an {{opponent}} to collect and examine even while a speech is still going on. This practice originated in part because cards are read at a rate faster than conversational speed but also because the un-underlined portions of cards are not read in round. Taking the cards during the speech allows the opponent to question the author's qualifications, the original context of the evidence, etc. in cross-examination. It is generally accepted whichever team is using <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> has priority to read evidence read previously during a round by both teams. As a result, large amounts of evidence may change hands after the use of <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> but before a speech. Most judges will not deduct from a team's <b>preparation</b> <b>time</b> for time spent finding evidence which the other team has misplaced.|$|E

40|$|In {{a closed}} quantum system of N coupled spins with {{magnetic}} quantum number I, {{there are about}} (2 I + 1) ^N constants of motion. However, the possibility of observing such quasi-invariant (QI) states in solid-like spin systems in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is not a strictly exact prediction. The aim of this work is to provide experimental evidence of several QI, in the proton NMR of small spin clusters, besides those already known Zeeman, and dipolar orders (strong and weak). We explore the spin states prepared with the Jeener-Broekaert pulse sequence by analyzing the time-domain signals yielded by this sequence {{as a function of}} the <b>preparation</b> <b>times,</b> in a variety of dipolar networks. We observe that the signals can be explained with two dipolar QIs only within a range of short <b>preparation</b> <b>times.</b> At longer times the time-domain signals have an echo-like behaviour. We study their multiple quantum coherence content on a basis orthogonal to the z-basis and see that such states involve a significant number of correlated spins. Then we show that the whole preparation time-scale can only be reconstructed by assuming the occurrence of multiple QI which we isolate experimentally...|$|R

30|$|An {{attractive}} future {{advancement in}} motion analysis is towards a fully automatic, non-invasive, markerless approach, which would ultimately provide {{a major breakthrough}} for research and practice within sports biomechanics and rehabilitation. For example, motion could be analysed during normal training environments more readily, without the long subject <b>preparation</b> <b>times</b> associated with marker-based systems or the laborious processing required for manual methods. Moreover, it could provide a potential solution for a common dilemma faced by biomechanists, which stems from the trade-off between accuracy (laboratory-based analyses) and external validity (field-based analyses).|$|R

30|$|It is, therefore, {{clear that}} {{optoelectronic}} systems have made significant advancements {{in recent times}} {{within the field of}} biomechanics. However, even though careful methodological considerations can improve the accuracy of the data acquired, several limitations remain, including long participant <b>preparation</b> <b>times,</b> potential for erroneous marker placement or movement, and the unfeasibility of attaching markers in certain settings (e.g. sports competition). Perhaps one of the most fundamental problems is the physical and/or psychological constraints that attached markers impart on the participant, influencing movement execution. These drawbacks can limit the utility of marker-based systems within certain areas of sports biomechanics and rehabilitation, and have driven the exploration of potential markerless solutions.|$|R
