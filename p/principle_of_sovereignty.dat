50|$|His chief efforts, however, were {{concentrated}} {{on the history of}} ancient French law. A celebrated lawsuit in Alsace, pleaded by his friend and compatriot Ignace Chauffour, aroused his interest by reviving the question of the origin of the feudal laws, and gradually led him to study the formation of those laws and the early growth of the feudal system. His great work, Les Origines de l'ancienne France, was produced slowly. In the first volume, Le Régime seigneurial (1886), he depicts the triumph of individualism and anarchy, showing how, after Charlemagne's great but sterile efforts to restore the Roman <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> the great landowners gradually monopolized the various functions in the state; how society modelled on antiquity disappeared; and how the only living organisms were vassalage and clientship.|$|E

However, Eugene IV did not ratify all the decrees coming from Basel, nor make a definite submission to the supremacy of the council.

40|$|Humanitarian {{intervention}} {{refers to}} the use of force for the protection of human rights in a foreign state and usually against the will of the state in which force is used. The legality of unilateral humanitarian Intervention is a widely contested area in contemporary international law. It is a discussion that cuts across law, morality and foreign policy. Humanitarian intervention brings to the fore the contention between the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and political independence on one hand and human rights and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> common humanity on the other hand. Some scholars contend that humanitarian intervention is a violation <b>of</b> the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and political independence of states and violates Article 2 (4) of the United Nations (UN) Charter. Other scholars have argued that Artcicle 2 (4) of the UN Charter does not prohibit the use of force for human rights purposes but rather prohibits use of force which is targeted against a state's political framework or territorial annexation. They argue further that huamn rights constitutes one of the purposes of the UN and it is therefore unthinkable that the UN Charter will prohibit the use of force for such a purpose as human rights. Humanitarian intervention thus stands at the crossroasds <b>of</b> very foundational <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> both customary international law and the UN Charter. In this thesis, I argue that humanitarian intervention is illegal under the UN Charter as it does not fall within the two exceptions {{to the use of}} force: self-defence and Security Council sanctioned use of force. However, I go further to argue for the legitimacy of humanitarian intervention based on the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> common humanity and wider <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> This argument draws from the just war doctrine as postulated by Grotius and other early just war theorists. The need to allow for unilateral intervention is pertinent given the rise in the abuse of power by some governments. Sovereignty should not be an umbrella that shields human rights abuses...|$|R

5000|$|The {{claims made}} by human rights to {{universality}} {{have led to}} criticism. Philosophers who have criticised the concept of human rights include Jeremy Bentham, Edmund Burke, Friedrich Nietzsche and Karl Marx. Canadian political philosophy professor Charles Blattberg argues that discussion of human rights, being abstract, demotivates people from upholding the values that rights are meant to affirm. The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy gives particular attention to two types of criticisms: the one questioning universality {{of human rights and}} the one denying them objective ground. Alain Pellet, a French scholar on international law, criticises [...] "human rightism" [...] approach as denying the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and claiming a special place for human rights among the branches of international law; French journalist Alain de Benoist questions human rights premises of human equality. American scholar David Kennedy had listed pragmatic worries and polemical charges concerning human rights in 2002 in Harvard Human Rights Journal.|$|E

50|$|All {{states are}} {{varieties}} {{of a single}} organizational form, the sovereign state. All the great powers {{of the modern world}} rule on the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> Sovereign power may be vested on an individual as in an autocratic government or it may be vested on a group as in a constitutional government. Constitutions are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government. Although a constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten constitution. The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the legislative branch of government; {{this is just one of}} those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate.
