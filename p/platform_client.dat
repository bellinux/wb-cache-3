40|$|Are {{you using}} SAS Stored Processes in a SAS Intelligence Platform {{client-server}} environment? Do {{you want to}} convert existing SAS programs for use as SAS Stored Processes? This paper provides concrete examples of how to convert existing SAS programs to stored processes that can be executed from selected SAS Intelligence <b>Platform</b> <b>client</b> applications. Topics in this paper include: basic report program conversion, conversion of SAS/GRAPH ® programs, use of macro variables in program conversion, streaming versus transient output from stored processes, and permanent result packages. Special emphasis is given to showing code {{both before and after}} conversion— especially the use of Output Delivery System (ODS) options. SAS/GRAPH options are also illustrated with beforeand-after examples. In addition, there is some discussion of how different client applications accept the options and render output...|$|E

40|$|In {{the thesis}} we present the {{development}} of a platform for exchanging agricultural machinery. In the process of planning and implementing the project we take current tools and follow a modern concept of development. The two main adavantages of the platform are the use of customer location for easier and faster searching of items and a process called "smart matches" that is periodically checking if the user active items have any opposing type items that could be interesting for the user. The first part is comprised of database planning, based on the use case diagram, in MySQL Workbench and its realization in MySQL database. We also describe the platform implementation in Zend Framework 2 using the Model-View-Controller concept. Technologies like HTML, PHP, AJAX, JSON and JavaScript are widely used here. The first part ends with a brief description of libraries used to help us shorten the implementation time and a few words about the programming of a mobile application with PhoneGap tool. The second part is focused on the two main advantages of the <b>platform.</b> <b>Client</b> position utilitazion in our platform and items smart matches algorithm are presented within this part. The work concludes with ideas and possibilities for further development of the platform and a quick comparison with similar, existing solutions...|$|E
