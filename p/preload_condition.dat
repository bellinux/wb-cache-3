40|$|To {{identify}} the shock generated sources of shear type explosive bolt, five kinds of explosive bolts with different states, including high preload, low preload, no preload, no piston shear, and only propellant combustion, were designed. The decoupling of four kinds of shock sources, including {{the collision of}} propellant combustion, piston shear weak surface, end of piston stroke, and preload release, was realized. Their acceleration responses at 15 [*]cm from the shock source center on 60 [*]cm × 60 [*]cm × 1 [*]cm equivalent aluminum plate were measured by using the piezoresistive accelerometer. On this account, the relative contribution values along with frequency and the mean relative values without regard to frequency of various sources were calculated in high and low preload. Results show that the characteristics of different shock sources are different, and the shock induced by propellant combustion is mainly caused by high frequency, while piston shear and piston impact are concentrated in medium and low frequency. In the high <b>preload</b> <b>condition,</b> the preload release is major contributor to the overall shock response output, accounting for approximately 57. 51 %, while {{the contributions of the}} three shock sources of propellant combustion, piston shear, and piston impact are equivalent, but they are significant contributors in the low <b>preload</b> <b>condition.</b> This study provides design reference to reduce the pyrotechnic shock of shear type explosive bolt...|$|E

Jack-up usually has three working conditions: drilling <b>condition,</b> storm <b>condition,</b> <b>preloading</b> <b>condition.</b> The fulcrums of the cantilever in the drilling condition are less than the other two. So the distribution of the cantilever force in the storm and <b>preloading</b> <b>conditions</b> becomes extremely complicated with the increase of fulcrums. In order to facilitate the evaluation of jack-up rig strength, a simplified analytical method and a finite element method (FEM) are presented to distribute the cantilever force on a jack-up rig during the storm and <b>preloading</b> <b>conditions.</b> For the simplified analytical method, the fulcrum force is obtained from the distance between the fulcrum and the position of the cantilever resultant force. For the FEM, the cantilever is assumed to be perfect rigid body without any strain. The fulcrum force is calculated according to the balance of the fulcrum forces. Both results of fulcrum force are analyzed and compared. It is shown that they are in good agreement. Thus both methods can be applied in distributing the cantilever force to evaluate the strength of jack-up rig...|$|R
40|$|Background: A Prospective {{observational}} {{study was designed}} assess the correlation between arterial pressure waveform derived indices and echocardiography derived stroke volume variation (SVV) at different <b>preload</b> <b>conditions</b> in patients undergoing elective craniotomies. Methods: Systolic pressure variation (SPV) and pulse pressure variation (PPV) were calculated from the arterial waveform. SVV was measured from transoesophageal echocardiography. After measuring baseline values for all three parameters, 1 g/kg of mannitol infusion (20 %) was given over 15 - 20 min. Repeated measurements of SPV, PPV, SVV, urine output and peak airway pressure were done at the interval of 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after stopping mannitol infusion. Pearson correlation coefficient (level of significance), and receiver operating characteristics curve were used for statistical analysis. Results: Significant correlation was present between SPV and SVV throughout the study. Significant correlation between SPV and PPV was present only at 90 min and 2 h after mannitol. The predictive effect of SPV and PPV in differentiating a volume loss ≥ 10 mL/kg was better than SVV. The best cut-off values for SPV, PPV and SVV were 12 %, 9 % and 20 %, respectively. Conclusions: During mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, SPV correlated significantly with SVV at different <b>preload</b> <b>conditions</b> following mannitol infusion.

30|$|It {{should be}} {{appreciated}} that both arrhythmias and spontaneous breathing activity {{will lead to}} misinterpretations of the respiratory variations in pulse pressure/stroke volume. Furthermore, for any specific <b>preload</b> <b>condition</b> the PPV/SVV will {{vary according to the}} tidal volume. Reuter and colleagues demonstrated a linear relationship between tidal volume and SVV [32]. De Backer and colleagues evaluated the influence of tidal volume on the ability of the PPV to predict fluid responsiveness [33]. These authors reported that the PPV was a reliable predictor of fluid responsiveness only when the tidal volume was at least 8 mL/kg. For accuracy, reproducibility, and consistency we suggest that the tidal volume be increased to 8 to 10 mL/kg ideal body weight before and after a fluid challenge.|$|E

Multidirectional motions, such as those, resulting from axial torsion, cannot be recorded by standard radiology. Experimental {{data suggest that}} lumbar torsion contributes to lumbar disc degenerative changes, such as instability, spondylolisthesis and spinal canal stenosis. However, even under experimental conditions, characterization of lumbar torsion {{has not yet been}} achieved. In this study, the kinematic response to axial torsion with superimposed axial compression (200 N), compression-flexion (3 and 6 Nm) and compression-extension (3 and 6 Nm) was investigated in cadaveric lumbar functional spinal units. Range of motion (ROM), and helical axes of motion (HAM), were analyzed. There was no difference in ROM between no preload, pure compressive and flexion-compression <b>preload</b> <b>conditions.</b> The ROM was significantly reduced by both extension-compression <b>preload</b> <b>conditions</b> (11 % reduction for 3 Nm and 19 % reduction for 6 Nm of extension) compared to the pure compressive preload. For no-preload, the average HAM position in the transverse plane of the intervertebral disc was near the posteriormost part of the disc and located laterally on the side contralateral to the applied torsional moment. In the transverse plane, the HAM position showed a discrete trend towards the posterior part of the specimens during extension. Kinematic data were visualized using computer animation techniques and CT-based reconstructions of the respective specimens. This information may be used for identifying and characterizing physiologic and pathologic motion and for specifying conservative and surgical treatment concepts and, thus, in proving the indication for spinal fusion or in evaluating the effect of future semi-flexible instrumentation...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{transient}} high {{temperature in the}} uniaxial compressive strength of high strength concrete was investigated. The temperatures studied varied from 100 ∘ to 800 ∘C. The presence of loads in a structure was simulated by preloading the test specimens during the heating period.

For temperatures between 400 ∘ and 800 ∘C,the compressive strength of concrete decreased to thirty percent of that at room temperature. One third of the preloaded specimens failed explosively during the heating period.

Previous research suggests exposure to cues associated with slimming such as images or odours act as prompts to restrict intake of a tempting snack in dieters. The effects of consuming diet-congruent foods on subsequent intake of a meal have not yet been investigated. Thus, using a repeated measures design 26 female participants (dieters or non-dieters) consumed a diet-congruent (100 kcal salad), hedonic (100 kcal garlic bread) or neutral (0 kcal water) preload. A lexical decision task measured the salience of diet and hedonic thoughts and participants were then offered pizza as a main meal. Appetite sensations were measured throughout the study. Compared to the hedonic and neutral preload, a diet-congruent preload reduced dieters’ entire meal intake by 21 %. In contrast, non-dieters consumed 9 % more in the hedonic <b>preload</b> <b>condition</b> compared to the neutral preload, yet showed no differences between the diet-congruent and other conditions. Salad lowered participants desire to eat and increased fullness compared to garlic bread and water preloads. Dieters were also less hungry after the salad compared to the garlic bread and water preloads. Consuming a diet-congruent first course may prompt lower intake at a meal, in part due to facilitating resolve to refrain from overeating a tempting second course...|$|E

However, it is unknown whether this effect is evident among overweight and obese older adults, a population who would benefit from strategies to improve energy intake regulation. Our purpose was to determine whether premeal water consumption reduces meal energy intake in overweight and obese older adults. Twenty-four overweight and obese adults (body mass index= 34. 3 +/- 1. 2), mean age 61. 3 +/- 1. 1 years, were given an ad libitum standardized breakfast meal on two randomly assigned occasions. Thirty minutes before the meal, subjects were given either a 500 -mL water preload or no preload. Energy intake at each meal was covertly measured. Meal energy intake was significantly less in the water <b>preload</b> <b>condition</b> as compared with the no-preload condition (500 +/- 32 vs 574 +/- 38, respectively; P= 0. 004), representing an approximate 13 % reduction in meal energy intake.

Given the high prevalence of overweight and obesity among older adults, future studies should determine whether premeal water consumption is an effective long-term weight control strategy for older adults...|$|E
30|$|In {{critically}} ill patients, 2 D-strain allows early diagnosis of cardiac injuries that are non-detectable with conventional examinations [10, 11]. Previous studies identified GLS {{as an independent}} factor of mortality [12, 13]. In the peri-operative setting, speckle tracking is an emerging tool for the early detection of right and left ventricular dysfunction [14]. Kovács et al. [15] found that 2 D-strain reflects inotropism and correlates with elastance (Emax) and intraventricular pressure–volume curves in a rat model. In cardiology patients undergoing routine coronary angiography, fluid resuscitation did not affect GLS and systolic strain rate (SSR) [16]. Other studies [17, 18] in normal volunteers found diverging results. Conversely, animal studies suggest that fluid loading or acute unloading affects GLS and SSR [19, 20]. One clinical study in postcardiac surgery patients finds the same results, showing that the GLS and SSR are dependent on <b>preload</b> <b>condition</b> [21]. If for GLS, preload dependence is accepted, for the SSR this remains controversial. We hypothesized that this discrepancy {{was due to the}} position of the patient on the Frank and Starling curve. In the {{critically ill}} patient, preload and afterload constantly vary and preload dependency is an important parameter concerning up to 50 % of these patients [22, 23].

40|$|Squats {{have become}} a major tricky problem in the track of many railways. In {{the quest for the}} root causes of squats, it is {{observed}} that they are occasionally found at locations of track stiffness changes such as at fish-plated insulated joints and at switches and crossings. Obviously, there should be other factors in the track, which, together with the stiffness change, have played important roles otherwise there will be squats at all such locations. A validated hybrid multibody-finite element model of vehicle–track vertical interaction is extended to simulate the frictional dynamic rolling contact at a fish-plated insulated joint in order to identify such factors. Elastic– plastic rail material property is taken into account. It is found that it is track short defect in the <b>preload</b> <b>condition</b> of the bolts and the contact between the fishplates and the rail head, which together with the stiffness change, causes large normal and longitudinal contact force variation at the fishplate end so that differential wear and differential plastic deformation may accumulate at a fixed location. With proper wavelength, the accumulated rail top geometry deviation may grow into a squat. The significance of the present work lies in that other track short defects such as damaged and improper railpads and fastening, and ballast voids may also have such effects, which may be responsible for {{a large portion of the}} many squats in the tracks.

However, {{there is a}} scarcity of evidence whether the effects would persist or not after the carrying load is removed. This study aimed to investigate the carry-over effects of backpack carriage on trunk posture and repositioning ability. Thirteen healthy adults were recruited and instructed to walk on a treadmill for 30 min with backpack (10 % body weight) followed by 30 -min unloaded walking. Participant's trunk posture and repositioning ability were measured at different time points. During backpack carriage, reduction in lumbar lordosis and posterior pelvic tilt with significant increased cervical lordosis, thoracic kyphosis and trunk forward lean were observed. There was also {{a significant increase in}} repositioning errors in all spinal curvatures and trunk forward lean. After removal of the carrying load, there was a tendency for restoration of trunk posture and repositioning ability. However, the cervical lordosis and the repositioning error of all spinal curvatures could not be fully returned to the levels of the <b>preload</b> <b>condition</b> (all p < 0. 05). The persistent changes in both spinal curvature and repositioning ability revealed an increased risk of spinal injury even after the backpack was removed, and the effects on the neck and back pain warrant future study.

The prevalence of aortic valve insufficiency (AI) is rising in the aging population. However, reliability of CO monitoring techniques in AI is unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the impact of AI on accuracy, precision, and trending ability of transcardiopulmonary thermodilution-derived COTCPTD in comparison with pulmonary artery catheter thermodilution COPAC. Sixteen anesthetized domestic pigs were subjected to serial simultaneous measurements of COPAC and COTCPTD. In a novel experimental model, AI was induced by retraction of an expanded Dormia basket in the aortic valve annulus. The Dormia basket was delivered via a Judkins catheter guided by substernal epicardial echocardiography. High (HPC), moderate (MPC) and low cardiac preload conditions (LPC) were induced by fluid unloading (20 ml kg- 1 blood withdrawal) and loading (subsequent retransfusion of the shed blood and additional infusion of 20 ml kg- 1 hydroxyethyl starch). Within each <b>preload</b> <b>condition</b> CO was measured before and after the onset of AI. For statistical analysis, we used a mixed model analysis of variance, Bland-Altman analysis, the percentage error and concordance analysis. Experimental AI had a mean regurgitant volume of 33. 6 ± 12. 0 ml and regurgitant fraction of 42. 9 ± 12. 6 %. The percentage error between COTCPTD and COPAC during competent valve function and after induction of substantial AI was: HPC 17. 7 % vs. 20. 0 %, MPC 20. 5 % vs. 26. 1 %, LPC 26. 5 % vs. 28. 1 % (pooled data: 22. 5 % vs. 24. 1 %). The ability to trend CO-changes induced by fluid loading and unloading did not differ between baseline and AI (concordance rate 95. 8 % during both conditions).

Peak systolic pressure gradient, but not peak diastolic pressure gradient, was significantly linearly correlated to peak systolic velocity and peak diastolic velocity respectively. The shape of the two curves corresponded fairly well, but variations in pressure gradient preceded the variations in velocity.

Seven lambs underwent balloon atrial septostomy and were instrumented with vascular catheters, an electromagnetic flow transducer on the aorta, and a balloon occluder on the aorta. Four different <b>preload</b> <b>conditions</b> were established by volume infusion or withdrawal. Aortic flow was measured continuously during gradual occlusion of the aorta. Curves relating mean left atrial pressure to stroke volume before balloon inflation showed a plateau, with little increase in stroke volume with increases in atrial pressure above 7 mm Hg.

Curves relating left atrial pressure to stroke volume constructed at constant mean arterial pressure showed no plateau but showed continued increases in stroke volume as left atrial pressure was increased to 10 mm Hg. When mean arterial pressure is constant, the Starling mechanism is operative in newborn left ventricles.

40|$|To detect {{whether the}} mutual {{interaction}} occurring between the osteocytes-bone lining cells system (OBLCS) and the bone extracellular fluid (BECF) {{is affected by}} load through a modification of the BECF-extracellular fluid (ECF; systemic extracellular fluid) gradient, mice metatarsal bones immersed in ECF were subjected ex vivo to a 2 -min cyclic axial load of different amplitudes and frequencies. The electric (ionic) currents at the bone surface were measured by a vibrating probe after having exposed BECF to ECF through a transcortical hole. The application of different loads and different frequencies increased the ionic current in a dose-dependent manner. The postload current density subsequently decayed following an exponential pattern. Postload increment's amplitude and decay were dependent on bone viability. Dummy and static loads did not induce current density modifications. Because BECF is perturbed by loading, {{it is conceivable that}} OBLCS tends to restore BECF <b>preload</b> <b>conditions</b> by controlling ion fluxes at the bone-plasma interface to fulfill metabolic needs. Because the electric current reflects the integrated activity of OBLCS, its evaluation in transgenic mice engineered to possess genetic lesions in channels or matrix constituents could be helpful in the characterization of the mechanical and metabolic functions of bone...|$|R
30|$|In {{the serial}} SSC bundles up to 2018, fluid {{resuscitation}} {{had been a}} recommended first-line cornerstone therapy to support or prevent induced cardiovascular dysfunction and for reducing in-hospital mortality in sepsis [3]. On admission obvious shortage of the effective circulatory volume in septic patients (e.g., decreased input, enhanced water loss, vascular leak or third space) is the essential premise underlying this recommendation. In this setting, fluid resuscitation must be initiated {{as soon as possible}} (ASAP) often at the emergency room, and definitely within 3 – 6  h, whether hypotension is obviously present or not, and to ensure optimal <b>preload</b> <b>conditions</b> for a hemodynamic homeostasis. Of note, from the original SSC 2004, derived from the protocol-based RCT (early goal-directed therapy: EGDT) which first reported an effective algorithmic approach for improving outcome in early sepsis [33], the “ 6 golden hours” were first abridged to “ 3 golden hours,” the earlier always being the better form of management, as highlighted by a recent retrospective cohort study [34]. Then, the emphasis has been placed on “ASAP” fluid resuscitation support (i.e., within the 1 st hour of management, 30  mL/kg!) with further dynamic assessment enabling to identify patients who require more fluids and early introduction of vasopressors to reach a MAP target in the 2018 recommendations [4].|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{piezoelectric}} impedance {{frequency shift}} method is developed {{to estimate the}} bolt preload {{for the detection of}} bolt looseness in engineering structures. An experimental device that allows the precision control of the axial preload force on a bolt is designed and fabricated. A universal testing machine is used to preload accurately on the bolt in the experiments. Under different bolt <b>preload</b> <b>conditions,</b> the impedance analyzer measures the admittance (inverse of the impedance) signal of the PZT (Lead ZirconateTitanate) patches which are bonded on the bolt head. Firstly, a wide frequency band is swept to find a sensitive frequency band of the piezoelectric admittance with the imaginary part. Then in the sensitive frequency band, a specified peak frequency of the admittance signature is chosen to investigate the frequency shift with different bolt preloads. The relationship between the specified frequency shift and the bolt preload is established. The experimental results show that the specified peak frequency decreases as the bolt preload increases for both M 16 and M 12 bolts, and the frequency shift has a linear relationship with the preload on the bolt. The frequencies of the real and imaginary parts of the admittance signature have the same results. Therefore, the bolt preload can be determined by measuring the specified frequency shift and this method has a good application prospect...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to assess the effect of a single set of contrast preloading on peak vertical displacement (PD) during a loaded countermovement jump (LCMJ) training session. Nine strength-trained males participated in 2 randomly assigned, crossover design testing sessions consisting of 5 sets of 6 repetitions of 20 -kg LCMJs with 3 -minute rest intervals between sets. The preloading intervention was performed 3 minutes after the first set and 4 minutes before the second set of 20 -kg LCMJs. The control (CON) group performed 1 set of 20 -kg LCMJs, whereas the jump squat (JS) group performed 1 set of 40 -kg LCMJs. The number of repetitions performed during each <b>preloading</b> <b>condition</b> was varied to match total concentric work between the 2 sessions. A significant (p < 0. 05) preload × set interaction for PD was observed, with the JS group jumping significantly higher during the third set performed after the preload in comparison with the CON group. Analysis of peak power output and mean power output during the concentric movement for this set revealed that as the knee flexion angle increased, the effect of the preload was augmented. These results suggest that a single set of preloading exercises enhances performance during a lower-body explosive power training session; however, the effects of a single preloading set may not peak until midway through the training session...|$|R
