40|$|Background: The World Health Organization {{estimates}} that over 80 % of injury related deaths occur in low and middle-income Countries, including Tanzania. Alcohol and illicit drugs are major contributing factors leading to severe injuries by impairing motor and cognitive functions. In Tanzania, {{the use of}} alcohol and illicit drugs among injured patients {{has not yet been}} studied Objective: To describe the prevalence of alcohol and illicit drug use among injured patients presenting to the Emergency Medicine Department of Muhimbili National Hospital (EMD-MNH) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Materials and methods: This was a prospective descriptive cohort study of a consecutive convenience sample of patients aged 18 years and above presenting to the EMD-MNH with injury related complaints between October 2015 and November 2015. Structured data sheet was used to record demographic information, nature of injury, clinical presentation, alcohol and illicit drug test results, EMD outcome and disposition. Patients‟ alcohol level and illicit drug levels were tested by breathalyser device or swab stick alcohol test and 5 -multidrug <b>panel</b> <b>check</b> respectively. Patients were followed up for 24 hours and 30 days using ward-chats and phone call. We presents the descriptive statistics, sensitivity and specificity, and relative risk were used as appropriate. Results: We screened 1011 patients and we enrolled 143 (14. 1 %) patients who met our inclusion criteria. Most 123 (86 %) were male, and the median age was 30 years (IQR: 23 - 36). The most frequent mechanism of injury was road traffic accident 106 (74. 1 %) followed by assault 22 (15. 4 %). All 143 patients were tested for alcohol, while 122 were also tested for illicit drugs. 67 (47 %) of patients tested positive for alcohol. 44 (36. 1 %) of the 122 patients tested for illicit drugs, tested positive for drug(s). 29 (26. 1 %) of injured patients tested positive for both alcohol and illicit drug(s). The most frequently illicit drug was Marijuana 30 (68 %) of the positive illicit drugs tests. At 24 hours, 88 (61. 5 %) had underwent major surgery, 135 (94 %) were admitted, and 6 (4. 1 %) died. Among 53 patients with positive alcohol test 30 (57 %) denied the use of alcohol and among the 25 patients with positive illicit drug test, 22 (88 %) denied the use of substance abuse. At 30 viii days follow-up, 8 (5. 5 %) injured patients with positive test for alcohol and illicit drugs had died and 73 (54 %) had not yet returned to their baseline activities. Conclusion and recommendations: The prevalence of alcohol and illicit drugs is very high in patients presenting to the EMD-MNH with injury. Most patients who are affected are young males and the majority of the injured patients who had used drugs or alcohol before their injury had not returned to baseline functional level at 30 days post injury. Further studies are needed to generalise the results in Tanzania. Public health initiatives to decrease drinking and driving should be implemented...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Numerous investigative {{reports have}} cited the {{problems}} of inefficient food aid distribution by various international disaster relief agencies. These problems not only deprive the disaster victims of life giving support, but can also discourage potential sources of contributions. Lack of a feedback process has been attributed {{as a cause of}} organizational inefficiencies in these agencies. Existing old-fashioned distribution processes failed to incorporate present day tools for advanced process control. Investigations of food distribution organizations revealed a need for a state-of-the-art monitoring system. Typically, these systems incorporate an expert knowledge base which aids an adaptive decision making process. This research identified data related to food aid monitoring and evaluation processes of various international organizations. It then applied an artificial intelligence based expert system to develop a prototype for those processes. Existing data related to monitoring and evaluation program cycles were obtained from two international food relief organizations. An expert system shell called CLIPS (©NASA) was utilized to develop a prototype system named FAM (Food Aid Monitor) for monitoring and evaluating food aid distribution. FAM, a rule based expert system, uses facts and heuristic rules to provide advice regarding food aid monitoring and evaluation processes at various stages of an operation. The FAM was evaluated and validated by three expert <b>panels</b> <b>checking</b> the prototype system for: (1) completeness and relevancy, by a faculty expert panel; (2) consistency, (3) correctness, (4) and precision, by a software engineering expert panel; and (5) usability, by a field expert panel.

Considering this the objectives of Lithuanians Health Care System emphasize the necessity to create and implement health care policy that will ensure public health care, high quality of health care services. Health care ethics could be {{considered one of the}} most important factors having influenced the development of the principles for the patients’ right and the protection of persons’ dignity in the 21 st century. The need to explore and explain conscience within the caring context among health care professionals is an important task. The overall aim for the thesis was to describe the essence of the concept of Conscience reflected by care professionals and to adapt the questionnaire of Conscience in Lithuania hospital setting, with its psychometric evaluation. The thesis was designed as two part study. Part I the literature study was performed. Through PubMed and ELIN navigator which contains 17 data bases, covering the period from 1996 to 2005, June. Studies were included if they concerned perceptions of conscience exploration among care professionals in hospital setting. Methanalysis was carried out and model of Conscience was performed. The aim of study part 2 was to adapt the Lithuanian version of questionnaire Conscience to Lithuanian conditions and to test its reliability and validity. The adaptation procedure consisted of translation, expert <b>panel</b> <b>checking</b> relevancy of questions and examining psychometric properties of Lithuanian version of questionnaire Conscience. A pilot study was performed at two Lithuanian hospitals. Study subjects n = 99. Reliability was estimated by testing internal consistency. Correlation coefficient Cronbach’s alpha r = 0, 788, split half analysis correlation coefficients: Cronbach’s alpha r = 0, 575, Spearmans – Brown r = 0, 73, Guttman – Split half coefficient r = 0, 73. Validity was performed by testing face validity, content validity and construct validity. Face validity was confirmed by expert panel. Content validity was estimated by Cronbach’s Alpha if item deleted confirmed relevant data. An orthogonal principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation was conducted on the 16 items. Data adequacy KMO criterion on sphericity 0, 695 confirms that data fits to factor analysis. The six factors with factorial weight L ≤ 0, 4 explained 69 % dispersion of the data.
