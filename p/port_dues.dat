The port is able to take in ships measuring up to 1,500 GRT (Gross Register Tonnage), with general cargo area of 50,895 m2 and total developed area of 34 hectares (0.34km2). It is mainly used in handling petroleum, timber products, coal, and building materials. A total of 23.94 million metric tonnes of goods was handled by MPA from 2011 to 2013, which earned a total revenue of RM 48.58 million in <b>port</b> <b>dues.</b>|$|E

He sold most of his collection of vintage and veteran motor cars to raise the money to buy her. With a crew of one (a retired agricultural engineer, McKenzie (Ken) Morgan), Paul sailed her around the coast to Appledore, where she was berthed on the mud in the estuary outside the port (to avoid <b>port</b> <b>dues).</b> Paul resigned his post with James Fisher and spent the next five years working on the restoration of the schooner with the help of friends, financed by the sale of more of his collection of vintage cars and on occasion by work conducting sea trials on new vessels for Appledore shipbuilders. Paul's ambition was to restore her to working condition and then to ply the Bristol channel as a merchantman again, but the job proved too big a challenge and in 1970 he sold her to the Maritime museum.|$|E

60|$|The decayed and disfranchised {{borough of}} Calcombe Pomeroy, or Calcombe-on-the-Sea, {{is one of}} the prettiest and quietest little out-of-the-way watering-places in the whole smiling {{southern}} slope of the county of Devon. Thank heaven, the Great Western Railway, when planning its organised devastations along the beautiful rural region of the South Hams, left poor little Calcombe out in the cold; and the consequence is that those few people who still love to linger in the uncontaminated rustic England of our wiser forefathers can here find a beach unspoiled by goat-carriages or black-faced minstrels, a tiny parade uninvaded by stucco terraces or German brass bands, and an ancient stone pier off which swimmers may take a header direct, in the early morning, before the sumptuary edicts of his worship the Mayor compel them to resort to the use of bathing-machines and the decent covering of an approved costume, between the hours of eight and eight. A board beside the mouth of the harbour, signed by a Secretary of State to his late Majesty King William the Fourth, still announces to a heedless world the tolls to be paid for entry by the ships that never arrive; and a superannuated official in a wooden leg and a gold cap-band retains the honourable sinecure of a harbour-mastership, with a hypothetical salary nominally payable from the non-existent fees and <b>port</b> <b>dues.</b> The little river Cale, at the bottom of whose combe the wee town nestles snugly, has cut itself a deep valley in the soft sandstone hills; and the gap in the cliffs formed by its mouth gives room for the few hundred yards of level on which the antiquated little parade is warmly ensconced. On either hand tall bluffs of brilliant red marl raise their honeycombed faces fronting the sea; and in the distance the sheeny grey rocks of the harder Devonian promontories gleam like watered satin in the slant rays of the afternoon sun. Altogether a very sleepy little old-world place is Calcombe Pomeroy, specially reserved by the overruling chance of the universe to be a summer retreat for quiet, peace-loving, old-world people.|$|E

At {{the close}} of a winter day, [...] Their anchors down, by London town, the Three Great Captains lay; [...] And one was Admiral of the North from Solway Firth to Skye, [...] And one was Lord of the Wessex coast and all the lands thereby, [...] And one was Master of the Thames from Limehouse to Blackwall, [...] And he was Captain of the Fleet -- the bravest of them all. [...] Their good guns guarded their great gray sides [...] that were thirty foot in the sheer, [...] When there came a certain trading-brig with news of a privateer. [...] Her rigging was rough with the clotted drift that drives in a Northern breeze, [...] Her sides were clogged with the lazy weed that spawns in the Eastern seas. [...] Light she rode in the rude tide-rip, to left and right she rolled, [...] And the skipper sat on the scuttle-butt and stared at an empty hold.

[...] He spoke of the Law as he crimped my crew -- he swore it was only a loan; [...] But when I would ask for my own again, he swore it was none of my own. [...] He has taken my little parrakeets that nest beneath the Line, [...] He has stripped my rails of the shaddock-frails and the green unripened pine; [...] He has taken my bale of dammer and spice I won beyond the seas, [...] He has taken my grinning heathen gods -- and what should he want o' these?

[...] Had I had guns (as I had goods) to work my Christian harm, [...] I had run him up from his quarter-deck to trade with his own yard-arm; [...] I had nailed his ears to my capstan-head, and ripped them off with a saw, [...] And soused them in the bilgewater, and served them to him raw; [...] I had flung him blind in a rudderless boat to rot in the rocking dark, [...] I had towed him aft of his own craft, a bait for his brother shark; [...] I had lapped him round with cocoa husk, and drenched him with the oil, [...] And lashed him fast to his own mast to blaze above my spoil; [...] I had stripped his hide for my hammock-side, [...] and tasselled his beard i' the mesh, [...] And spitted his crew on the live bamboo [...] that grows through the gangrened flesh; [...] I had hove him down by the mangroves brown, [...] where the mud-reef sucks and draws, [...] Moored by the heel to his own keel to wait for the land-crab's claws!

[...] Your words be words of a lawless race, and the Law it standeth thus: [...] He comes of a race that have never a Law, and he never has boarded us. [...] We ha' sold him canvas and rope and spar -- we know that his price is fair, [...] And we know that he weeps for the lack of a Law as he rides off Finisterre. [...] And since he is damned for a gallows-thief by you and better than you, [...] We hold it meet that the English fleet should know that we hold him true." [...] The skipper called to the tall taffrail: -- [...] "And what is that to me? [...] Did ever you hear of a Yankee brig that rifled a Seventy-three? [...] Do I loom so large from your quarter-deck that I lift like a ship o' the Line? [...] He has learned to run from a shotted gun and harry such craft as mine.

[...] Must he have his Law as a quid to chaw, or laid in brass on his wheel? [...] Does he steal with tears when he buccaneers? [...] 'Fore Gad, then, why does he steal?" [...] The skipper bit on a deep-sea word, and the word it was not sweet, [...] For he could see the Captains Three had signalled to the Fleet. [...] But three and two, in white and blue, the whimpering flags began: -- [...] "We have heard a tale of a -- foreign sail, but he is a merchantman." [...] The skipper peered beneath his palm and swore by the Great Horn Spoon: -- [...] "'Fore Gad, the Chaplain of the Fleet would bless my picaroon!" [...] By two and three the flags blew free to lash the laughing air: -- [...] "We have sold our spars to the merchantman -- we know that his price is fair." [...] The skipper winked his Western eye, and swore by a China storm: -- [...] "They ha' rigged him a Joseph's jury-coat to keep his honour warm."

[...] It's fore-sheet free, with her head to the sea, [...] and the swing of the unbought brine -- [...] We'll make no sport in an English court till we come as a ship o' the Line: [...] Till we come as a ship o' the Line, my lads, of thirty foot in the sheer, [...] Lifting again from the outer main with news of a privateer; [...] Flying his pluck at our mizzen-truck for weft of Admiralty, [...] Heaving his head for our dipsey-lead in sign that we keep the sea.
