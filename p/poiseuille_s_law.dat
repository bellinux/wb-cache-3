The article proceeds to consider the ways in which U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> firms have become global organizations by offshoring their international identities, through the staffing of their non-U.

In spite of this, however, the core educational experience at nearly all U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> schools remains distinctly domestic in terms of substantive focus.

Hence, in contrast to previous studies, we evaluate the validity of Wagner 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>Law</b> and the ratchet effect hypothesis over {{a very long time}} period, starting at the beginning of industrialization. Cointegration analysis is used to investigate the long-run relationships between government expenditure and GDP, focusing on sub-periods and structural breaks.

40|$|For centuries, the United States has seized {{individuals}} oversees and, outside {{any formal}} extradition process, brought such individuals to the United States to stand trial. A more recent wrinkle {{has been the}} transfer of such individuals to other countries {{for the purposes of}} prosecution or interrogation.

Numerous commentators, asserting that many of these activities violate U. <b>S.</b> <b>law,</b> have called on the U. S. government to cease such operations and prosecute U.

Nonetheless, President Barack Obama established a Special Task Force, which recently advocated the continued use of rendition operations, though it suggested some policy changes. In order to effectuate such changes and understand their impact, the Administration, as well as the critics and proponents of rendition operations, need to understand current U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> regarding renditions. Yet, despite all the focus, concern, and criticism over rendition operations, no scholarly work to date has evaluated the entirety of U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> regarding such activities.
