40|$|Musical wind {{instruments}} are interesting examples of nonlinear vibrating systems. The {{way in which}} a self-sustained oscillation is formed is surprisingly complex, even for a simplified model. In short, a wind instrumentconsists of a resonator and a generator. The resonator is the air column inside the instrument, and is usuallycharacterized by the linear wave equation. The generator consists of some kind of <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>valve,</b> wherethe relationship between air flow and pressure is starkly non-linear. A simplistic model of sound generation can bebased {{on the assumption that the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>valve</b> functions as a negative resistance at one of the resonancefrequencies of the resonator. Such a model, however, neglects the modal coupling due to the non-linearities that areultimately the primary reason why different wind instument sound so different. The aim of this paper is to studyhow limit cycles of a clarinet-like instrument can be treated in the framework of nonlinear normal modes (NNM). The reason for persunig this subject is to ultimately be able to derive models of reduced complexity, which are ofinterest for sound synthesis. Another goal is to identify important control parameters (functions of such entitiesas blowing pressure, pincing force and position of the player’s lips on the reed etc) which can be regulated by amusician in an intuitive way, without a long period of training...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} work, {{the authors}} presented a generalized parametric {{model of a}} <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>valve,</b> allowing the user to design a continuum of reed configurations, including “blown open”, “blown closed ” and the “swinging door”.

In this work we further explore the sound production of the generalized reed by incorporating reflection filters measured from actual musical instruments. The measurement technique is shown to produce results closely matching theoretical expectation for cylindrical and conical tubes, and is applied to the clarinet and trumpet.

40|$|A reed, or more generally, a {{pressure-controlled}} valve, is {{the primary}} resonator for many wind instruments and vocal systems. In physical modeling synthesis, the method used for simulating the reed typically depends on whether an additional upstream or downstream pressure causes the corresponding side of the valve to open or close further. In this work, a generalized and configurable model of a <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>valve</b> is presented, allowing the user to design a reed simply by setting the model parameters. The parameters are continuously variable, and may be configured to produce blown closed models (like woodwinds or reed-pipes), blown open models (as in simple lip-reeds, the human larynx, harmonicas and harmoniums) and symmetric “swinging door ” models.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 211 In {{order to}} ensure safe, reliable, {{efficient}} and cost effective operation of reciprocating pumps, pump dynamics should not be ignored. Pump problems due to dynamics are often difficult to diagnose and solve. Dynamic problems usually lie {{in one or more}} of the following areas: *Pulsation control (piping acoustics) *Vibration control (piping mechanics) *Cavitation control (pulsation and pressure drop) *Pump valve dynamics (valve motion). All the areas can be interactive to such an extent that it is difficult to know where the most effective changes can be made. A clear summary of each area will be presented with a view towards understanding how these areas can interact. The topic will be approached from an engineering perception viewpoint (a spectral energy response overlay) with minimal emphasis on mathematical concepts. Following the energy as it transfers though the whole system reveals how inefficient energy transfer and local energy magnification (resonance) is key to understanding how to prevent or solve everyday problems. Problems such as vibration, bladder failure, valve failure, poor performance, fatigue failure, and safety concerns are usually linked to one or more dynamic areas. Along with a basic understanding of the physics involved in pump dynamic areas, it is also helpful to have a working knowledge of ?rule of thumb? techniques that can be reliable and extremely cost effective. Pulsation control will be viewed using mechanical analogies with cause and effect scenarios. Vibration control will be focused on reducing the shaking force through reducing acoustic-to-mechanical coupling mechanisms, instead of brute force mechanical modifications. Cavitation and NPSHR (the inlet pressure required to prevent cavitation) problems will be viewed from a simple understanding of local instantaneous pressure compared to vapor pressure. Valve dynamics will be viewed in terms of simple fluid pressure forces, as they are exerted on a <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>valve</b> element. This engineering perception has a firm theoretical foundation but requires only fundamental mathematics to employ. Two short case histories will be presented illustrating pulsation/vibration control, cavitation control and pump valve problems. In almost all cases, piping vibration is the result of pulsation coupling into mechanical shaking forces yielding vibration with possible fatigue failures. Pump manifolds and external piping can be modified to ensure nonresonant acoustic systems that greatly reduce vibrational force. Once the shaking force is reduced, it remains to ensure that mechanical resonance is not present. Although cavitation is generally thought to be pressure drop related, in many cases it can be traced to acoustical resonances associated with the pump manifold and connected piping. Pump valve problems are generally solved through increasing spring stiffness, decreasing lift and employing more rugged materials. The use of newly developed materials has had the tendency of appearing as a universal fix where high pulsation levels can be tolerated. The best solution for many valve problems is reducing the pulsations that induce excessive impact forces. The use of a spectral energy response overlay or window is a concept that is in use by many who deal with dynamic problems. This type of approach is easily understood, but not as rigorous as the actual model approach. It should become apparent that most design quality can be determined by the overlay approach. It is not intended to replace the full model, but it will produce a good initial starting design and form the basis for analyzing existing field problems...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the Electrohydraulic Power Steering system for road vehicles, using {{electronic}} <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> With an ever increasing demand for safer vehicles and fewer traffic accidents, steering-related active safety functions are becoming more common in modern vehicles. Future road vehicles will also evolve towards autonomous vehicles, with several safety, environmental and financial benefits. A key component in realising such solutions is active steering. The power steering system was initially developed to ease the driver's workload by assisting in turning the wheels. This is traditionally done through a passive open-centre hydraulic system and heavy trucks must still rely on fluid power, due to the heavy work forces. Since {{the purpose of the}} original system is to <b>control</b> the assistive <b>pressure,</b> one way would be to use proportional <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> Since these are electronically controlled, active steering is possible and with closed-centre, energy efficiency can be significantly improved on. In this work, such a system is analysed in detail with the purpose of investigating the possible use of the system for Boost curve control and position control for autonomous driving. Commercially available valves are investigated since they provide an attractive solution. A model-based approach is adopted, where simulation of the system is an important tool. Another important tool is hardware-in-the-loop simulation. A test rig of an electrohydraulic power steering system, is developed. This work has shown how proportional <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> can be used for Boost curve control and position control and what implications this has on a system level. As it turns out, the valves add {{a great deal of time}} lag and with the high gain from the Boost curve, this creates a control challenge. The problem can be handled by tuning the Boost gain, pressure response and damping and has been effectively shown through simulation and experiments. For position control, there is greater freedom to design the controller to fit the system. The pressure response can be made fast enough for this case and the time lag is much less critical...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the fuel}} {{injection}} pressure in diesel engines {{is one of}} the main parameters which determine the emissions and the fuel efficiency, a precise control algorithm for the common-rail pressure is a required priority for improving the engine performances. This paper proposes a coordinated common-rail <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> strategy for passenger car diesel engines using a metering unit and a <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> The metering unit, which is located at the high-pressure pump, adjusts the inlet fuel flow for the common rail using a first-order polynomial equation that describes the relation between the inlet fuel flow and the outlet fuel flow for the common rail. The injected fuel flow is used as the input for the control algorithm to determine the driving current of the metering unit. The designed control strategy for the metering unit effectively reduces the rail pressure wave generated by the high-pressure pump. Furthermore, since the inlet fuel flow is adjusted according to the injected fuel flow, the proposed control algorithm shows a robust performance to the injection disturbance. The <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> located on the common rail adjusts the outlet fuel flow of the common rail. The control algorithm for the <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is designed using quantitative feedback theory to assure robustness even when the variation in the plant characteristics (such as the static gain and the time constant) is caused by the metering unit operation. Engine experiments proved that the proposed control strategy can reduce the variation in the steady-state rail pressure to less than 10 bar; in addition, the proposed rail pressure controller has a good degree of consistency under various engine operating conditions.
