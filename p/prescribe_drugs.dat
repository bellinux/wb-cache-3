25|$|A {{consultation}} typically {{begins with}} a lengthy patient interview focusing on lifestyle, medical history, emotional tone, and physical features, {{as well as physical}} examination. Many naturopaths present themselves as primary care providers, and some naturopathic physicians may <b>prescribe</b> <b>drugs,</b> perform minor surgery, and integrate other conventional medical approaches such as diet and lifestyle counselling with their naturopathic practice. Traditional naturopaths deal exclusively with lifestyle changes, not diagnosing or treating disease. Naturopaths do not generally recommend vaccines and antibiotics, based in part on the early views that shaped the profession, and they may provide alternative remedies even in cases where evidence-based medicine has been shown effective.|$|E
25|$|Many authors {{note the}} most obvious {{difference}} between the curricula of DO and MD schools is osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM), a form of hands-on care used to diagnose, treat and prevent illness or injury and is taught only at DO schools. As of 2006, the average osteopathic student spent almost 8 weeks on clerkships for OMM during their third and fourth years. The National Institute of Health's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health states that overall, {{studies have shown that}} spinal manipulation can provide mild-to-moderate relief from low-back pain and appears to be as effective as conventional medical treatments. In 2007 guidelines, the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society include spinal manipulation as one of several treatment options for practitioners to consider using when pain does not improve with self-care. Spinal manipulation is generally a safe treatment for low-back pain. Serious complications are very rare. A 2001 survey of DOs found that more than 50% of the respondents used OMT (osteopathic manipulative treatment) on less than 5% of their patients. The survey was the latest indication that DOs have become more like MD physicians in all respects: fewer perform OMT, more <b>prescribe</b> <b>drugs,</b> and many perform surgery as a first option. One area which has been implicated, but not been formally studied regarding the decline in OMT usage among DOs in practice, is the role of reimbursement changes. Only {{in the last several years}} could a DO charge for both an office visit (Evaluation & Management services) and use a procedure (CPT) code when performing OMT; previously, it was bundled.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate the influences of differing physician characteristics and attitudes on the diagnosis of emotional problems, and the prescribing of selected psychotropic and non-psychotropic drugs. The 32 physicians who completed the study recorded 10, 585 patient visits, which accounted for 7934 <b>prescribed</b> <b>drugs.</b> Overall, 549 (6. 9 %) of the <b>drugs</b> <b>prescribed</b> were classified as psychotropic drugs. After controlling for patient characteristics, there was not a statistically significant relationship between board certification, practice size, or physician age and the rate at which study physicians diagnose emotional problems. Board certification, physician age, physician propensity to <b>prescribe</b> <b>drug</b> therapy, and the feeling that patients expect drug therapy were significantly related to the <b>prescribing</b> of non-psychotropic <b>drugs.</b> Unlike the <b>prescribing</b> of non-psychotropic <b>drugs,</b> the <b>prescribing</b> of psychotropic <b>drugs</b> was not predictable.

2500|$|The Indian {{government}} began encouraging more drug manufacturing by Indian {{companies in the}} early 1960s, and with the Patents Act in 1970. The Patents Act removed composition patents for foods and drugs, and though it kept process patents, these were shortened to a period of five to seven years.

2500|$|Before the 1920s, {{regulation}} in Britain {{was controlled by}} the pharmacists. Pharmacists that {{were found to have}} prescribed opium for illegitimate causes and anyone found to have sold opium without proper qualifications would be prosecuted. Due to the passing of the Rolleston Act in Britain in 1926, doctors could prescribe opiates such as morphine and heroin on their own accord if they felt their patients demonstrated a medical need. Because addiction was viewed as a medical problem rather than an indulgence, doctors were permitted to allow patients to wean themselves off opiates rather than cutting off any opiate use altogether. The passing of the Rolleston Act put the control of opium use in the hands of medical doctors instead of pharmacists. Later in the 20th century, the addiction to opiates, especially [...] in young people, continued to rise and so the sale and prescription of opiates was limited to doctors in treatment centers. If these doctors were found to be prescribing opiates without just cause, then they could lose their license to practice or <b>prescribe</b> <b>drugs.</b>|$|E

2500|$|National {{or local}} (i.e. state or provincial) {{legislation}} governs who {{can write a}} prescription. In the United States, physicians (either M.D., D.O., or D.P.M.) have the broadest prescriptive authority. All 50 states and the District of Columbia allow licensed certified Physician Assistants (PAs) prescription authority (with some states, limitations exist to controlled substances). All 50 states allow registered certified nurse practitioners and other advanced practice registered nurses (such as certified nurse-midwives) prescription power (with some states including limitations to controlled substances). Many other healthcare professions also have prescriptive authority related to their area of practice. [...] Veterinarians and dentists have prescribing power in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Clinical pharmacists are allowed to prescribe in some states {{through the use of}} a drug formulary or collaboration agreements. Florida pharmacists can write prescriptions for a limited set of drugs. In all states, optometrists prescribe medications to treat certain eye diseases, and also issue spectacle and contact lens prescriptions for corrective eyewear.

2500|$|In September 1899, {{a medical}} doctor in Davenport named Heinrich Matthey started a {{campaign}} against drugless healers in Iowa, demanding {{a change in the}} statute to prevent drugless healers from practicing in the state and claiming that health education could no longer be entrusted to anyone but doctors of medicine. Osteopathic schools across the country responded by developing a program of college inspection and accreditation. D.D. Palmer, whose school had just graduated its 7th student, insisted that his techniques did not need the same courses or license as medicine, as his graduates did not <b>prescribe</b> <b>drugs</b> or evaluate blood or urine. In 1901, D.D. was charged with misrepresenting a course in chiropractic which was not a real science. He persisted in his strong stance against licensure, citing freedom of choice as his cause. He was arrested twice more by 1906, and although he contended that he was not practicing medicine, he was convicted for professing he could cure disease without a license in medicine or osteopathy. Dr Solon Langworthy, who continued to mix chiropractic at the ASC, took a different route for chiropractic. He improved classrooms and provided a curriculum of study instead of the single course. He narrowed the scope of chiropractic to the treatment of the spine and nervous system, leaving blood work to the osteopath, and began to refer to the brain as the [...] "life force". He was the first to use the word subluxation to describe the misalignment that narrowed the [...] "spinal windows" [...] (or intervertebral foramina) and interrupted the nerve energy. In 1906, Langworthy published the first book on chiropractic, Modernized Chiropractic"– [...] "Special Philosophy– A Distinct System. He brought chiropractic into the scientific arena.|$|E

Methods: We performed a retrospective study of patients who visited the outpatient clinic of GifuMunicipalHospital and received anti-hypertensive agents between June 2006 and December 2011.
