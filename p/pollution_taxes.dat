However, Hahnel, who teaches ecological economics at American University, argues that in a market economy businesses try to avoid the [...] "polluter pays principle" [...] by shifting {{the burden of the}} costs for their polluting activities to consumers. In terms of incentives he argues this might be considered a positive development because it would penalize consumers for [...] "dirty" [...] consumption.

When tax revenues are used to subsidize either firms' hiring or investments, employment may also increase, creating a ‘double dividend’ from the <b>pollution</b> <b>tax.</b> A <b>pollution</b> <b>tax</b> increase used to subsidize current employment is always less effective than a hiring subsidy, and is totally ineffective when subsidies equal <b>pollution</b> <b>tax</b> revenues for each individual firm.

40|$|Cournot {{oligopoly}} {{has been}} studied almost exclusively under the implicit assumption of perfectly competitive factor markets. However,oligopolistic firms procure often factors of production from imperfectly competitive markets. Okuguchi(1998, 2000) has analyzed Cournot oligopoly under the condition of imperfectly competitive factor markets,i. e. Cournot oligopsonistic oligopoly. Some economists have analyzed the optimal <b>pollution</b> <b>tax</b> rate which maximizes the net total social surplus for Cournot oligopoly(see Barnett(1980),Baumol and Oates(1980),Levin(1985),Okuguchi and Yamazaki(1994),Simpson(1995) and Okuguchi(2003)).

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impacts of}} a production <b>pollution</b> <b>tax</b> on environmental capital flight and national product in a two-country static general equilibrium model with two-way foreign investment. It is assumed that the capital input in both countries is a composite good of domestic and imported capital. And pollution is assumed to originate in the production process. The productivity of capital in each country is negatively (or positively) related to the worldwide aggregate emissions. The analysis shows that when a domestic <b>pollution</b> <b>tax</b> is levied, domestic capital outflows increase and foreign capital inflows decrease for sufficiently high elasticities of substitution between labor (immobile input) and capital (mobile input) in both countries. Moreover, with negative transnational externalities, increases of a domestic <b>pollution</b> <b>tax</b> reduce domestic production and increase foreign production. The difficulty of substitution between immobile and mobile inputs hinders the optimal allocation of worldwide capital and national product. In this paper, the optimal <b>pollution</b> <b>tax</b> is based on global welfare maximization, not on global income maximization, taking into consideration the impact of income change on individual welfare. Therefore, an optimal <b>pollution</b> <b>tax</b> in the developing country should be lower for a given rate of pollution.

Command and control regulation is not considered an economic instrument as it is typically enforced by narrower means such as stop or control order, though it may include an administrative monetary penalty in site-specific regulations.

That is, the optimistic finding by Rapanos (2007) that environmental protection policy reduces urban unemployment in the long run does not always hold.

40|$|Economists widely {{agree that}} in concept, <b>pollution</b> <b>taxes</b> {{are the most}} {{cost-effective}} means of reducing pollution. With the advent of monitoring and enforcement technologies, the case for pollution taxation is generally getting stronger on the merits. Despite widespread agreement among economists, however, <b>pollution</b> <b>taxes</b> remain unpopular, especially in North America. Some oppose <b>pollution</b> <b>taxes</b> because of a suspicion that government would misspend the tax proceeds, while others oppose <b>pollution</b> <b>taxes</b> because they would impose economic hardships upon certain individuals, groups, or industries. And there is no pollution tax more pathologically hated as the gasoline tax. This is unfortunate from an economic perspective, as a gasoline tax is easy to implement, and is a reasonable Pigouvian tax, scaling proportionately with the harms of consumption. Surprisingly, there is a dearth of theory explaining this cleave between economists and virtually everybody else. Drawing on behavioralist literatures, this paper introduces several theories as to why people and governments so vehemently oppose <b>pollution</b> <b>taxes.</b> Using the example of gasoline taxes, we provide some empirical evidence for these theories.
