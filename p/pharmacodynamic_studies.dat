50|$|Studies of {{the effect}} of tenatoprazole on acid {{secretion}} in in vivo animal models, such as pylorus-ligated rats and acute gastric fistula rats, demonstrated a 2- to 4-fold more potent inhibitory activity compared with omeprazole. A more potent inhibitory activity was also shown in several models of induced gastric lesions. In Asian as well as Caucasian healthy subjects, tenatoprazole exhibited a seven-fold longer half-life than the existing H+/K+ ATPase inhibitors. It is thus hypothesized that a longer half-life results in a more prolonged inhibition of gastric acid secretion, especially during the night.A strong relationship has been stated between the degree and duration of gastric acid inhibition, as measured by monitoring of the 24-hour intragastric pH in <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>studies,</b> and the rate of healing and symptom relief reported.A clinical study showed that nocturnal acid breakthrough duration was significantly shorter for 40 mg of tenatoprazole than for 40 mg of esomeprazole, with the conclusion that tenatoprazole was significantly more potent than esomeprazole during the night.

40|$|Background: We {{have studied}} the in vitro and in vivo utility of {{polyethylene}} glycol (PEG) -hydrogels {{for the development of}} an anticancer drug 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) delivery system. Methods: A 5 -FU-loaded PEG-hydrogel was implanted subcutaneously to evaluate the drug retention time and the anticancer effect. For the pharmacokinetic study, two groups of male rats were administered either an aqueous solution of 5 -FU (control group) /or a 5 -FU-loaded PEG-hydrogel (treated group) at a dose of 100 mg/kg. For the <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>study,</b> a human non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma (NSCLC) cell line, A 549 was inoculated to male nude mice with a cell density of 3 × 106. Once tumors start growing, the mice were injected with 5 -FU/or 5 -FU-loaded PEG-hydrogel once a week for 4 weeks. The growth of the tumors was monitored by measuring the tumor volume and calculating the tumor inhibition rate (IR) over the duration of the study. Results: In the pharmacokinetic study, the 5 -FU-loaded PEG-hydrogel gave a mean residence time (MRT) of 8. 0 h and the elimination half-life of 0. 9 h; these values were 14 - and 6 -fold, respectively, longer than those for the free solution of 5 -FU (p < 0. 05).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the potential bactericidal activity of amoxicillin-clavulanate against β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli strains and to elucidate the extent to which enzyme production affects the activity. Six adult Yucatan miniature pigs received a single intravenous dose of 1. 1 g of amoxicillin-clavulanate as an intravenous infusion over 30 min. The pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for the serum samples and compared to the published data for humans (2. 2 -g intravenous dose). The parameters were comparable for the two species, and therefore, the miniature pig constitutes a good model for <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>study</b> of amoxicillin-clavulanate. Therefore, the model was used in an ex vivo <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>study</b> of amoxicillin-clavulanate against four strains of Escherichia coli producing β-lactamases at different levels. The E. coli strains were cultured with serial dilutions (1 : 2 to 1 : 256) of the serum samples from the pharmacokinetic study, and the number of surviving bacteria was determined after 1, 3, and 6 h of exposure. Amoxicillin-clavulanate at concentrations less than the MIC and the minimal bactericidal concentration had marked bactericidal potency against the strain that produced low levels of penicillinase. For high-level or intermediate-level β-lactamase-producing strains, the existence of a clavulanate concentration threshold of 1. 5 to 2 μg/ml, below which there was no bactericidal activity, was demonstrated. The index of surviving bacteria showed the existence of mixed concentration- and time-dependent actions of amoxicillin (in the presence of clavulanate) which varied as a function of the magnitude of β-lactamase production by the test strains. This study shows the effectiveness of amoxicillin-clavulanate against low- and intermediate-level penicillinase-producing strains of E. coli. These findings are to be confirmed in a miniature pig experimental infection model...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pharmacodynamic</b> <b>studies</b> of Helicobacter pylori {{exposed to}} amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, omeprazole, and {{lansoprazole}} were performed with microscopy, viable count determination, and biolumines-cence assay of intracellular ATP. The pharmacodynamic parameters determined were change in morphology, change in cell density, postantibiotic effect (PAE), and control-related effective regrowth time (CERT). The PAE is delayed regrowth after brief exposure to antibiotics or acid pump inhibitors. CERT {{was defined as}} the time required for the bacteria to resume logarithmic growth and return to the pre-exposure inoculum in the test culture minus the corresponding time for the control culture. CERT measures the combined effect of initial killing and PAE. There was a good concordance between the bioluminescence assay and viable counts for determining CERT, which makes this parameter useful for <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>studies</b> of the effects of antibi-otics and acid pump inhibitors on H. pylori. Amoxicillin and metronidazole produced a strong, concentration-dependent initial decrease in CFU per milliliter, but there was a less prominent initial change in intracellular ATP in these cultures. Amoxicillin caused a long PAE when assayed by the bioluminescence assay but no PAE or a negative PAE when assayed by viable count determination. However, amoxicillin showed similar long CERTs with both methods.

AZD 3409 was administered orally to patients with advanced solid malignancies using an interpatient dose-escalation scheme starting at 500 [*]mg AZD 3409 once daily. Twenty-nine patients were treated at seven dose levels. The MTD of part A was defined as 750 [*]mg b. i. d. in the fasted state.
