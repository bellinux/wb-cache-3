40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an experimental}} “infrastructuring” process to transform bottom-up ini- tiatives into public-interest services,by using {{a set of}} design methods and tools coming from service design research. The starting point is a renewed activism {{on the part of}} citizens that has led to a variety of initiatives which can be understood as new forms of services in between public and private, amateur and <b>professional,</b> <b>profit</b> and not for profit, market and society. The majority of these activities are characterised by transience and overlapping and need an infrastructuring pro- cess in order to avoid their weakening and ultimate failure. Building upon this experimentation by “Creative Citizens”, this paper presents the main results of the author’s doctoral research, outlining an infrastructuring process in ten stages that focuses on collaboration among designers, citizens, institutions and local stakeholders. This represents an attempt to go further into the issues related to incubation and replication of solutions and, in a more extensive way, it might be viewed as an attempt to explore how social innovation could grow thanks to the design contribution. Finally, the paper focuses on the role of designer within this process, shifting from the role of facilitator to that of change maker and advocate...|$|E

There are some preconditions for each of them and there have some expectations of the outcome of the time spent. Because these factors are not related in a straight way, the analysis of the problem needs knowledge discovery. We choose artificial neural networks to recognize some patterns related to this problem. In neural network analyses, sometimes the results are good, but we cannot transform it in adequate conclusions. These results are fitted to predict the outcomes of new data. Neural networks mimic the functions of the human brain. In comparison with the fuzzy sets, the artificial neural network is the hardware, and the fuzzy set model is the software approach of, sometimes, the same problem. We have a brunch of problem, for that the neural network model cannot be substituted by the fuzzy model, although the results of the fuzzy approach are most human-readable. Our problem is maybe closer to the fuzzy system, but this time we want to verify the neural network approach. We use this analysis to discover patterns between the inputs of a human that goes outboard to work in foreign country {{for a period of time}} and the outputs of the work, like material realization, education and <b>professional</b> <b>profit.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Pojava tambure u Sjedinjenim Državama proizašla je iz tamburaške prakse u nas krajem devetnastog stoljeća, kamo su je prenijeli brojni iseljenici. U prvo vrijeme orkestri su se ponajčešće stvarali od ljudi doseljenih iz istoga kraja, ili na obiteljskoj osnovi. Poznati su i primjeri iseljavanja iz domovine cjelokupnih orkestara. Veći dio orkestara djelovao je unutar hrvatske etničke zajednice, ali se dio najsposobnijih uključio u opći glazbeni život Amerike, često u okviru popularnih "chautauqua" i "vaudeville" priredbi. Važne promjene nastaju osnivanjem sveučilišnog profesionalnog tamburaškog orkestra The Duquesne University Tamburitza Orchestra. The {{appearance}} of the tambura in the Croatian community in the United States of America is a continuance of a tambura-playing practice that was present {{during the last two}} decades of the nineteenth {{and the beginning of the}} twentieth century in Croatia. During that period of time a new direction of the tambura orchestras, the so-called concert direction, was formed, and it ended the process of the orchestration and of the spreading of such orchestras among all Croats, thus making the tambura the Croatian national instrument. Historian, player and composer of the tambura music, Josip Andrić, claims that the tambura orchestra “Hrvatska lira”, whose leaders were Mijo Majer and Milutin Farkaš, founded in 1882 in Zagreb, had played a deciding role in initiating and spreading of the tambura concert orchestras. The development of the tambura orchestra music has taken three basic directions from that time onward. One of them was the above mentioned concert direction. It includes at least basic musical literacy (being able to read the notes), larger body (twelve or more musicians) and a conductor, and was mainly connected to larger or smaller urban environments. The second direction was pointed towards rural and smaller urban settlements, in which half-professional tambura groups have almost entirely pushed aside the soloists with time, thus becoming the main accompaniment to dancing and singing. The third direction is composed of professional tambura orchestras that used to play in cafés, and were especially popular in Bačka, Srijem and Slavonia. Being the founders of all the tambura orchestras, they have kept their original features: playing varoške and bećarske songs, round dances, patriotic songs and marches for the most part, and accompanying the dance only from time to time. In his book “A History of the Tambura”, conductor and tambura historian Walter W. Kolar places the first American tambura orchestras and performers at the end of the nineteenth century. For the most part, these are smaller groups, at the beginning having three to six members, later six to ten, twelve the most, and the instruments they were playing were most often the farkašice. Most of them learned how to play the tambura in their homeland before their arrival to the States, and those players make the core of all the groups. The groups are often composed on a family level, at the level of a village or an area of settlement from different Croatian regions. They used to play and sing at local dance parties, weddings, family, birthday and other functions, festivities, banquets and picnics. Their engagements were mostly within the frame of the Croatian ethnic community, and sometimes within a wider, Slavic one; they rarely played for others. There were the ones who had successful professional careers, which demandedstepping out of the ethnic framework and appearing on stage at public events. Their success was often connected with the stage appearances within chautauqua and vaudeville shows, that were especially popular in the public life of America from the beginning of the twentieth century until the World War II. This was the way for the tambura to appear in front of a non-Slavic audience and play an active role in the development of the American entertainment and musical life. During the late 1920 s and the early 1930 s, first children tambura orchestras have been founded. The generations born in the States have overtaken the responsibilities for their further development. Another incentive came from founding a large professional orchestra at the Dequesne University in Pittsburgh. The orchestra was founded as a high <b>professional</b> <b>profit</b> institution, and it widened its work by establishing a school for tambura players, that soon spread through its branches throughout the cities of western Pennsylvania. Youth tambura orchestras, all being a spitting image of their mentor and idol, have arisen from the local schools. It motivated the Croatian Fraternal Union to establish youth cultural choirs, the so-called nests of the CFU. Ten years later, in 1966, the Croatian Fraternal Union Junior Cultural Federation was founded, and from that period on the CFU has finally overtaken the leading role in further development of the amateur playing the tambura, singing and dancing in the United States. Each year, the Federation organizes a festival at which almost all the members gather and where, besides individual performances, common playing takes place as well. The {{appearance of}} folk dances within the framework of the tambura youth orchestras has been motivated by the “Duquesne University Tamburitzans”. Already inthe second half of the 1960 s, the university orchestra has gained a respectable professional folklore dance group and its programmes have become a mixture of orchestra music, songs and dances from a wider south Slavic area. During the early 1970 s, the youth tambura choirs also introduce folk dances to their programmes, but, unlike their idol’s practice, those were for the most part Croatian...|$|E

Guidelines recommend stepped and interdisciplinary collaborative care models for the treatment of depression. OBJECTIVES: Stepped and collaborative care models are described regarding their efficacy and cost-effectiveness. A current model project within the Hamburg Network for Mental Health exemplifies how guideline-based stepped diagnostics and treatment incorporating innovative low-intensity interventions are implemented by a large network of health care professionals and clinics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An accompanying evaluation using a cluster randomized controlled design assesses depressive symptom reduction and cost-effectiveness for patients treated within "Health Network Depression" ("Gesundheitsnetz Depression", a subproject of psychenet. de) compared with patients treated in routine care. RESULTS: Over 90 partners from inpatient and outpatient treatment have been successfully involved in recruiting over 600 patients within the stepped care model. Communication in the network was greatly facilitated by the use of an innovative online tool for the supply and reservation of treatment capacities. The participating <b>professionals</b> <b>profit</b> from the improved infrastructure and the implementation of advanced training and quality circle work. CONCLUSIONS: New treatment models can greatly improve the treatment of depression owing to their explicit reference to guidelines, the establishment of algorithms for diagnostics and treatment, the integration of practices and clinics, in addition to the implementation of low-intensity treatment alternatives. These models could promote the development of a disease management program for depression...|$|R

Foundations & Principles of Distributed Manufacturing anticipates future advances in the fields of embedded systems, the Internet of Things and cyber physical systems, outlining how adopting these innovations could rapidly bring about improvements in key performance indicators, which could in turn generate competition pressure by rendering successful business models obsolete. In laying the groundwork for powerful theoretical models, high standards for the homogeneity and soundness of the suggested setups are applied. The book especially elaborates on the upcoming competition in online manufacturing operations and respective control procedures. By outlining encapsulation and evolving decision-making principles, Foundations & Principles of Distributed Manufacturing fully conceptualizes the view of manufacturing networks as sets of loosely coupled interacting smart factory objects. Moreover, the book provides concrete approaches to a number of future fields, where distributed manufacturing might be applied. Both researchers and <b>professionals</b> will <b>profit</b> from the authors’ broad experience in Distributed Manufacturing and Fractal Enterprise implementations, where they initiated and completed a number of successful research projects: within the global Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (IMS) scheme, within the European Research Area frameworks as well as national contexts, and both in industry and at leading research institutions.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Low-income {{women in}} an Oregon city of {{approximately}} 35, 000 inhabitants have {{limited access to}} prenatal care services during their pregnancies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to uncover the impacts of several factors on the experiences of twenty-seven health department clients with public health department prenatal care practitioners and with local private obstetricians. Ethnographic interviews were conducted with the clients, two health department practitioners, two local obstetricians, and one local direct-entry midwife. The focal finding that emerged from the research was that the clients preferred the care of the health department practitioners to that of obstetricians, even though the health department providers could not deliver the women's babies. The major impacts on the clients' experiences included fragmented service delivery and availability, economic and social restrictions on prenatal care options, biomedical constructs of a healthy pregnancy, and provider role constructions and attitudes towards Medicaid recipients and uninsured pregnant women. Local physicians' mechanistic philosophy, <b>professional</b> dominance and <b>profit</b> orientation afforded them a narrow understanding of the needs and identities of low-income women. Local public health workers are less professionally autonomous than medical doctors but their service orientation allowed them the potential to better serve low-income clients. Based on the twenty-seven clients' perceptions of their care providers and the services available to them, recommendations are made for more empowering, comprehensive prenatal care services in this county. Recommended changes to the public health system entail expanded funding for more appropriate programs and to establish continuity of care for health department clients from pregnancy through the postpartum period. The incorporation of direct-entry midwives into the prenatal and birthing care options open to low-income women is also recommended. Senate Bill 1063, which creates a process for direct-entry midwives to become state-licensed in order to be reimbursed by the Office of Medical Assistance Programs for perinatal services, is considered in terms of its implications for low-income women, the Oregon community of direct-entry midwives, and the texture of Oregon reproductive health care...|$|R

In essence, the latter introduces the reader to the arcane and esoteric world of cultural taxonomy. The taxonomic discussion is not entirely adequate: indeed much of the rationale and history is absent, but a careful study of the chapter will build a useful vocabulary and provide some inkling of why archeologists think as they do. It should be apparent at this juncture that The Archeology of Colorado is aimed at the nonprofessional reader, that 2 ̆ 2 intelligent layman 2 ̆ 2 who is so often ignored by the scholarly and academic writer. In short, the author has produced a 2 ̆ 2 popular 2 ̆ 2 book intended to satisfy the widespread interest in archeology. I suspect it will satisfy that interest in Colorado rather well. It is unpretentious and never patronizes; moreover, the volume is informatively illustrated, and archeological sites are described and placed in appropriate contexts. The conscientious reader will gain a useful overview of Colorado prehistory, laced with enough hard data and local color to make it vital. My assessment is generally favorable, but there are faults in the book. Some chapters, particularly those dealing with the plains, are cursive and not remarkably well informed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide banks, {{economic}} planners and policy makers with knowledge on individualâ€™s saving behaviour so as to assist them in framing appeals accordingly. To achieve this, the study sought to test the applicability of the life cycle hypothesis of saving to Zimbabwe. The life cycle hypothesis of saving is one of the well-known theories that seek to explain individualâ€™s saving behaviour. The study was motived by the lack of depositor confidence and the challenge of accretive transitory deposits coupled by stagnant long term deposits which have faced the country since the introduction of the Multiple Currency System (MCS) despite money supply being on an upward trend. A coalesced of the comparative and survey research design, where data was collected from a sample of 512 respondents drawn from the general public in Bulawayo and Gweru was found to be the most appropriate. Quantitative and qualitative data was collected using a combination of questionnaires, interviews and secondary data from the 2012 national census and Poverty Income Consumption and Expenditure Survey (PICES) 2011 / 12. This data was analysed using a combination of MS Excel, Stata 12, thematic and content analysis. The results of the study revealed that the major motive for saving during an individualâ€™s working years is for the purchase or construction of land and housing. Saving for life after retirement was the fourth most common motive for saving coming after the saving for childrenâ€™s education and the precautionary motive. Furthermore, the results found that the primary source of income during retirement was business, <b>professional</b> and farming <b>profits.</b> In line with the life cycle hypothesis, income followed a â€˜humpedâ€™ pattern peaking in middle age. However, income did not exceed consumption in the middle age contrary to the life cycle hypothesis. Moreover, the study revealed that age varies with asset holding in a â€˜waveâ€™ shaped pattern. Despite the actual results suggesting that the life cycle hypothesis is not applicable, the study found that if one goes by peopleâ€™s intentions and attitudes the life cycle hypothesis was applicable in Zimbabwe. Given that the life cycle hypothesis is not applicable in Zimbabwe, banks are therefore advised to frame appeals for the purchase or construction of land and housing for cohorts in the 25 - 44 year age group. Banks can frame appeals on retirement products to those approaching retirement as this motive only becomes dominant as people approach retirement. Lastly, the study recommends banks to raise awareness of â€˜pay yourself firstâ€™ in addition to educating people how to save for retirement...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} commercialisation processes of handicraft producers in Sabah, Malaysia, and the factors influencing their development and performance. The Malaysian government encourages handicraft production {{as a full-time}} activity in dedicated workshops, {{but the vast majority}} of producers stay part-time and home-based. The aim of this research is to understand why so few producers switch to a greater level of commercialisation, despite government support. From the literature review, it is found that a combination of person-related and contextual factors influences small enterprise development and performance, but handicraft producers in a developing country context have different characteristics to the firms usually studied in entrepreneurship, so they may follow different development paths. Therefore, qualitative research was carried out (in-depth interviews with 16 handicraft producers), which aimed to understand deeply from the producers’ point of view how they made choices about their enterprises, and the factors that encouraged or inhibited their move to full-time status or workshop premises. It was found that interviewees perceived part-time domestic production to be convenient and flexible, and workshop production to be a big commitment, although factors such as level of perseverance and social networking were influential to these. In the interviews, a complicated relationship between status, premises and enterprise performance was also found. A face-to-face survey was then conducted of 210 handicraft producers in Sabah region, which aimed to test quantitatively the factors that influence producers’ status, premises and performance, and the relationships between them. Through cluster analysis, three groups of producers were identified: (i) ‘high performance full-timers’, (ii) ‘part-time professionals’ and (iii) ‘part-time home workers’. The first group contained both domestic and workshop-based producers, all full-time status, and showed highest levels of sales and profits. It was interesting to find that part-time <b>professionals</b> had lower <b>profit</b> levels than part-time home workers, even though almost all part-time professionals produced in workshops, half of them in government assisted workshops. One way ANOVA tests found significant differences between the clusters on thirteen person-related and contextual factors, including producers’ (i) education level, attendance in craft incubator, previous income activity, (ii) self-confidence, perseverance, (iii) skills relating to production, organising and networking, (iv) income maximisation motivation and (v) access to government supports, financial resources and reliable workers. The evidence from the research shows that handicraft producers in Sabah region see many advantages in domestic production, and profit levels can be higher than in workshops. By identifying the different profiles of handicraft producers in Sabah, and the person-related and contextual factors that influence them, this research may help the Malaysian government to develop effective support policies for different types of handicraft producer, including how to encourage more individuals to become ‘high performing full-timers’...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a large}} {{growing body}} of {{literature}} in finance highlighting anomalies in the behaviour of individual investors, which violate the axioms of rationality. However, {{much of the research}} draws upon the experimental findings of cognitive psychologists for explanations of these anomalies. One of the key motivating issues behind this thesis is to determine whether professional (2 ̆ 7 local 2 ̆ 7) traders exhibit psychological biases in their trading behaviour {{in the context of a}} real financial market setting. This research uses real-world trading data and includes every trade in share price index (SPI) futures contract placed by a local trader at the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) over the sample period 24 July, 1997 - 4 October, 1999. This approach is applied in three separate papers. 2 ̆ 7 The House Money Effect and Local Traders at the Sydney Futures Exchange 2 ̆ 7, analyses whether professional traders behave in a manner that is consistent with the house money effect or other behavioural phenomenon, in particular loss aversion. Existing work suggests that professional traders exhibit psychological inconsistencies in their trading behaviour (Coval and Shumway, 2005; Locke and Mann, 2004, 2005; Frino et al., 2004). This paper models afternoon risk on morning profit and morning losses, respectively. The results provide strong evidence of the house money effect. In particular, morning profits encourage local traders to increase their risk-taking attitudes in afternoon trading sessions. 2 ̆ 7 Trading Horizons and Behavioural Biases: Does Time Matter? 2 ̆ 7, analyses whether locals exhibit behaviour biases, such as the house money effect or loss aversion, over various trading horizons. Results reported in previous studies are mixed. Coval and Shumway (2005) find no evidence of abnormal trading behaviour across days, amongst proprietary traders at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), while and Locke and Mann (2004) provide substantial evidence of loss aversion across days, amongst floor traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Results from this research report strong evidence of the house money effect. However, this bias is only evident when locals evaluate their performance at high-frequency time intervals within intraday-trading cycles. 2 ̆ 7 <b>Professional</b> Futures Traders, <b>Profits</b> and Prices 2 ̆ 7 analyses whether the behavioural biases of local traders affect prices. Work in this particular area is limited. Coval and Shumway (2005) report that proprietary traders at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) behave in a manner that is consistent with loss aversion. Moreover, their results show that this behaviour impacts on short-term prices but has no longer-term impact. This research documents a similar finding, however, morning profits encourage local traders to buy contracts at higher prices and sell contracts at lower prices in the afternoon. This behaviour can be used to explain short-term afternoon price movements of one, two and three units, respectively. Results show that prices revert to earlier levels in the five-minute period following a price-setting trade, negating any permanent price impact...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} and qualifies {{a module}} {{introduced to a}} selection of Management School students in 2014 / 15. ULMS 549 Venture Dynamics: Buying, Building, Selling Enterprises is a new core module for MSc Entrepreneurship students but an elective module for MSc’s in Accounting and Finance, Operations and Supply Chain Management, Project Management, International Business and Management. It is a practical initiative which aims to move the entrepreneurship education remit and general management perceptions of entrepreneurship away from the traditional start-up focus, to the alternative objective of buying and growing an existing business. Students use ‘live cases’ of actual businesses that are advertised online For Sale in the UK. Students are required to research the business, apply for the available accounts, negotiate with vendors, assess multiple buying alternatives and identify opportunities to increase the chosen business’s value by working as management buy-in teams. The back story to the module’s significance is that the students have all been made redundant and have agreed to pool their redundancy packages together which is [an imaginary] £ 250, 000. They know in advance {{that they have to}} increase the value of the business they choose in order to sell it on for profit but the percentage changes each year. In 2014 / 15 their target was a 25 % increase in value and sale price. This module instils consideration that formulating an exit strategy is increasingly important whereas traditional approaches to entrepreneurship education all too often imply that starting up and maintaining a new business is the objective in itself (Pardo 2013). Increasingly new businesses get started in-order-to be bought out by a larger firm. Several authors have noted the limitations in entrepreneurship education imposed by traditional assessment tools such as examinations, report writing, presentation exercises and business plans (Edwards & Muir 2012; Gibb 2011; Jones & Penaluna 2013). This module requires firstly a group Investment Proposal [for 30 % of overall grade] to validate why their chosen business is regarded as a sound investment. The second assessment [for 70 % of overall grade] is an individual strategic proposal for how to go about adding value so all the group members can free up their capital, hopefully with some <b>profit.</b> <b>Professional</b> Business Transfer Agents also called Commercial Business Brokers are invited in to teach students the important formulas, procedures and technicalities for buying an existing business. They also cover the key areas to address when it comes to sell the business the groups chose to purchase. Serial and portfolio entrepreneurs are guest lecturers showing students that after a few start-up experiences, good and bad, business transfers become a normal way of life; a career choice. The learning is situated within a broader educational framework which includes a focus on family business succession problems, international M&As and the historical small business transfer environment. SME Transfer Agent sector is a rapidly growing market in itself...|$|R
