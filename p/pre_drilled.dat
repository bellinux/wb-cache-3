40|$|In {{this paper}} three animal models which are well {{established}} in orthodontic research were used. The rabbit model served to induce an arthritis of the temporomandibular joint {{by means of}} two methods, by a single and by repeated injections of ovalbumin. Using the Mankin-score {{and the number of}} TRAP-positive cells, it could be shown that in case of repeated injections the inflammation is boosted. A reduction of the inflammation is possible by etanercept or methorexate, A growth inhibiting effect could be proven by roentgen cephalometrics and by volumetry, respectively. The therapy resulted in an improvement, but, could not totally normalise the mandibular development in comparison to the control group. FAMI-screws healed after insertion in the mandibular alveolar process of the miniature pig irrespective of whether it had been <b>pre</b> <b>drilled</b> or not. After three months of closed healing, the bone to screw contact amounted to about 65 %. Independent from the mode of insertion, the percentage of newly formed bone was equal with or without pre drilling. The mineral apposition rate of the miniature pig was slightly above that in humans. Independent from orthodontic charge and its duration, micro damage represented as micro cracks and diffuse damage could be found in the maxillary alveolar process of the rat. But, a significant accumulation at the pressure side at the first day after the initiation of tooth movement could not be verified under the conditions used in this experiment...|$|E
40|$|The driver has {{two main}} {{assemblies}} (5, 6) forming a manipulator (1). The first assembly; (5) has a releasable connection (3) for the manipulator to a vehicle (2), a working platform (7) and a working pedestal (8) for guidance and alignment for the manipulator on the vehicle. As {{a part of}} the first assembly, the working platform is connected to the second assembly (6) for driving the stakes (18) which is movable by a drive opposite the vehicle deck frame in the longitudinal direction (9) ie. travel direction of the vehicle. The second assembly (6) has an implement for <b>pre</b> <b>drilling</b> the ground and driving the stakes into place. USE/ADVANTAGE - For Snow retaining fences. Allows accurate positioning of the stakes in the ground...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to design and build a DC to DC power converter that can operate in an oil well, while the oil well is being drilled. In order, for the power converter {{to be able to}} operate in such extreme conditions, all the semiconductors that will be used need to be made from silicon carbide or silicon insulator. 1. 2 Significance Currently oil companies are trying to implement a new procedure for oil well drilling. This new procedure is called the No Drilling Surprise (NDS); the NDS consists of three phases. The first phase is a <b>pre</b> <b>drill</b> plan, the second phase is monitoring the drilling operation, and the third is reviewing and reporting on how the drilling process could have been improved. The problem with implementing the NDS procedure is that the onsite engineers have no way of receiving “real time data ” from the oil well to assess potential surprises sooner. Without the “real time data ” from the oil well the chances of surprises are very high, thus raising the cost of drilling the oil well. 1. 3 Methods Due to the extreme conditions that the power converter will be exposed to,...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} {{to carry out a}} structure, in which the desire of having a high score and seeing the name in the top list is used in web-based drills and helps students to be more willing in test solving. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the effects of web-based drills on motivation and learning in a competitive atmosphere. Furthermore, the study also attempts to determine if the students’ levels and frequency of using a computer have an effect on the test scores in a web based system. Over a period of two week application students logged in the system using their own passwords and solve questions whenever they wanted. The names and photographs of the students who achieved the best scores were declared on the school’s website. In the study, an experimental design has been applied. The data were collected through the database in the web-based <b>drill,</b> <b>pre</b> and post survey to determine the level of and the reasons for students’ use of the website and history common exam results. According to the findings of the research, the website that has the competitive atmosphere has a positive effect on students’ achievement in their lessons. The application led to a change in students’ aim to visit the website and the frequency of their visits. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Metal cutting {{has been}} shown by other researchers, as well as within this work, to be a {{stochastic}} process with many complex behaviours and sources of variance which detrimentally affects the scatter in tool life results. Empirical testing is still the preferable method for cutting tool development especially in an industrial environment, as models are currently unable to replicate the complex interaction between cutting tool and workpiece as tool wear {{is the result of}} several mechanisms working simultaneously. The need to quantify differences in sample groups and make sound statistical inferences about their populations is crucial for any tooling manufacturer to manage the level of quality, as well as to continually improve their products. This is highlighted in the cutting tool market as end users are continually demanding longer tool lives, low variance and no early tool life failures, as large amounts of overhead costs are incurred in partially manufactured components, with sudden tool failure resulting in substantial costs to a business. Therefore, the objective of this research was to design and develop a destructive accelerated drill test which is robust, sensitive, rapid and low cost. It was found, that although sources of machining complexity and variance which affects the scatter in tool life data have been identified within the literature, a solution to deal with it has not yet been provided. Using a systems approach facilitated the management of the complex behaviours so a machining regime could be identified which offered a repeatable and mono-modal tool failure, a robust test, as well as, where possible, to minimise and empirically model the effect of machining variance on tool life scatter, a sensitive test. Annealed D 2 cold work tool steel was able to offer a low tool life standard deviation and a mono-modal tool failure mode. In stark contrast P 20 plastic mould steel showed a larger standard deviation and a bi-modal failure mode. This work also showed that for accelerated testing of HSS cutting tools, which are thermally sensitive, an abrasive wear test is preferable over a thermo-chemical wear type. <b>Pre</b> inspection of <b>drill</b> geometries for the rejection of Jobber drills outside of tolerance was found to be insignificant when distinguishing the difference between sample means. It was assumed that the drills outside of tolerance would be randomly distributed, along with their effect on tool life. It was important however to determine, that the drills outside of tolerance, would have a small effect on the standard deviation in tool life, relative to the sample size and relative to the sample means so statistically significant results could be determined. An extended Taylor&rsquo;s tool life model was generated which modelled the effect of plate hardness between the range of 467 HLD to 511 HLD for annealed D 2. This work showed that the life of uncoated M 2 HSS 6. 35 mm Jobber drills is sensitive to small changes in plate hardness. At a cutting speed of 25 m/min an increase in plate hardness from 467 HLD to 492 HLD, an increase of 5. 3 %, decreased drill life by 70. 9 %...|$|R
