40|$|Real-time {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) is a highly sensitive method {{that can be used}} for the detection and quantification of microbial populations without cultivating them in anaerobic processes and environmental samples. This work was conducted to design <b>primer</b> <b>and</b> <b>probe</b> sets for the detection of methanogens using a real-time PCR with the TaqMan system. Six group-specific methanogenic <b>primer</b> <b>and</b> <b>probe</b> sets were designed. These sets separately detect four orders (Methanococcales, Methanobacteriales, Methanomicrobiales, and Methanosarcinales) along with two families (Methanosarcinales and Methanosaetaceae) of the order Methanosarcinales. We also designed the universal <b>primer</b> <b>and</b> <b>probe</b> sets that specifically detect the 16 S rDNA of prokaryotes and of the domain Bacteria and Archaea, and which are fully compatible with the TaqMan real-time PCR system. Target-group specificity of each <b>primer</b> <b>and</b> <b>probe</b> set was empirically verified by testing DNA isolated from 28 archaeal cultures and by analyzing potential false results. In general, each <b>primer</b> <b>and</b> <b>probe</b> set was very specific to the target group.

40|$|Given {{that the}} {{integration}} of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) into the host genome occurs preferentially with the disruption of the E 2 gene, a ratio of E 2 to E 7 gene copies is often used as a marker for integration. It is largely undetermined, however, whether ratio estimates are affected by HPV intratypic variations. We assembled four plasmid constructs, each containing a DNA fragment from an HPV 16 European, Asian-American, African- 1, or African- 2 variant. These constructs and nine cervical swab samples were assayed by real-time PCR with two primer-probe sets for each gene: a specific set, fully complementary to the HPV 16 prototype, and a degenerate set, incorporating degenerate bases at positions where nucleotides differed among the variants. The ratio of E 2 to E 7 gene copies for the European variant construct was close to 1, no matter which sets of <b>primers</b> <b>and</b> <b>probes</b> were used. While the ratios for the African- 1 and Asian-American variant constructs remained close to 1 with the degenerate sets of <b>primers</b> <b>and</b> <b>probes,</b> the ratios were 0. 36 and 2. 57, respectively, with the specific sets of <b>primers</b> <b>and</b> <b>probes.</b> In addition, a nucleotide alteration at the position immediately following the 3 ′ end of the E 2 forward primer binding site {{was found to be}} responsible for an underestimation of E 2 gene copies for the African- 2 variant construct. Similar patterns were found in nine cervical samples. In conclusion, mismatches between the <b>primers</b> <b>and</b> <b>probes</b> and their targets due to HPV 16 intratypic variations would introduce errors in testing for integration; this situation can be sufficiently ameliorated by incorporating degenerate bases into the <b>primers</b> <b>and</b> <b>probes...</b>|$|E

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} that anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) {{are involved in the}} anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulfate reduction in marine sediments, different <b>primers</b> <b>and</b> <b>probes</b> specifically targeting the 16 S rRNA gene of these archaea have been developed. Microbial investigation of the different ANME subtypes (ANME- 1; ANME- 2 a, b, and c; and ANME- 3) was mainly done in sediments where specific subtypes of ANME were highly enriched and methanogenic cell numbers were low. In different sediments with higher archaeal diversity and abundance, it is important that <b>primers</b> <b>and</b> <b>probes</b> targeting different ANME subtypes are very specific and do not detect other ANME subtypes or methanogens that are also present. In this study, <b>primers</b> <b>and</b> <b>probes</b> that were regularly used in AOM studies were tested in silico on coverage and specificity. Most of the previously developed <b>primers</b> <b>and</b> <b>probes</b> were not specific for the ANME subtypes, thereby not reflecting the actual ANME population in complex samples. Selected primers that showed good coverage and high specificity for the subclades ANME- 1, ANME- 2 a/b, and ANME- 2 c were thoroughly validated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). From these qPCR tests, only certain combinations seemed suitable for selective amplification. After optimization of these primer sets, we obtained valid primer combinations for the selective detection and quantification of ANME- 1, ANME- 2 a/b, and ANME- 2 c in samples where different ANME subtypes and possibly methanogens could be present. As a result of this work, we propose a standard workflow to facilitate selection of suitable primers for qPCR experiments on novel environmental samples. </p...|$|E
