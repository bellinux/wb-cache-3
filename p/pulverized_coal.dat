5|$|After {{returning}} {{her guests}} to New York, West Alsek sailed to Baltimore, Maryland, for operation by the Oriole Line. She sailed for Cardiff, {{becoming the first}} ship depending only on <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> to cross the Atlantic, and back to Baltimore on 18 August. Early results showed {{that in addition to}} making the transatlantic crossings about 10% faster than she had before, West Alsek used about 30% less coal during the voyage. West Alsek continued to be a test platform for assessing the <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> system during a voyage to Glasgow, her second for the Oriole Line.|$|E
5|$|West Alsek was {{selected}} for a test program {{by the addition of}} coal pulverizers—units that crushed coal and mixed it with air for injection into the boilers. She became the first steamship to cross the Atlantic ocean depending solely on <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal.</b> Test results showed that she sailed faster and used less coal than before the conversion. West Alsek was later abandoned by the USSB and scrapped in 1933.|$|E
25|$|The {{power density}} of boilers was {{increased}} by using forced combustion air and by using compressed air to feed <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal.</b> Also, coal handling was mechanized and automated.|$|E

50|$|A {{pulverizer}} or grinder is {{a mechanical}} device for the grinding {{of many different}} types of materials. For example, a pulverizer mill is used to <b>pulverize</b> <b>coal</b> for combustion in the steam-generating furnaces of fossil fuel power plants.|$|R
30|$|In addition, <b>pulverized</b> <b>coals</b> were heated rapidly at high {{temperatures}} and generated plenty of sp 2 hybridized carbon atoms (carbon free radicals) and C* fragments. These fragments could not react timely in the combustion furnace and became coke, which also increased the microcrystalline {{parameters of the}} unburned coal (Takanohashi et al. 1999; Akiyama 2000; Michael 2002).|$|R
25|$|The size of blast {{furnaces}} grew greatly over the 20th century and innovations like additional heat recovery and <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal,</b> which displaced coke and increased energy efficiency.|$|E
25|$|IGCC also consumes {{less water}} than {{traditional}} <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> plants. In a <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> plant, coal is burned to produce steam, {{which is then}} used to create electricity using a steam turbine. Then steam exhaust must then be condensed with cooling water, and water is lost by evaporation. In IGCC, water consumption is reduced by combustion in a gas turbine, which uses the generated heat to expand air and drive the turbine. Steam is only used to capture {{the heat from the}} combustion turbine exhaust for use in a secondary steam turbine. Currently, the major drawback is the high capital cost compared to other forms of power production.|$|E
25|$|A {{key issue}} in {{implementing}} IGCC is its high capital cost, which prevents it from competing with other power plant technologies. Currently, ordinary <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> plants are the lowest cost power plant option. The advantage of IGCC {{comes from the}} ease of retrofitting existing power plants that could offset the high capital cost. In a 2007 model, IGCC with CCS is the lowest-cost system in all cases. This model compared estimations of levelized cost of electricity, showing IGCC with CCS to cost 71.9 $US2005/MWh, <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> with CCS to cost 88 $US2005/MWh, and natural gas combined cycle with CCS to cost 80.6 $US2005/MWh. The levelized cost of electricity was noticeably sensitive {{to the price of}} natural gas and the inclusion of carbon storage and transport costs.|$|E
30|$|Drilling fluid’s pH value {{directly}} {{affects the}} coal’s wettability, and different wettability is {{relative to the}} different pH values. The <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal’s</b> self-priming height decreases firstly and then increases and increases finally, the solution with pH value of 9 makes the coal’s hydrophilicity weakest, so pH value should be adjusted properly when preparing the drilling fluid.|$|R
40|$|Combustion {{behavior}} of <b>pulverized</b> <b>coals</b> (PC), gasification and thermal annealing of cokes were investigated under controlled environments. Physical and chemical properties of PCI, coke and carbon residues of blast furnace dust/sludge samples were characterized.

40|$|Desulphurization by the {{microwaves}} {{is closely}} related to the form of sulphur compound in coal, its chemical structure, as well as the chemical activity of the leaching. <b>Pulverized</b> <b>coals</b> were desulphurized by the treatment with molten NaOH and KOH. The caustic - coal mixture was heated by the microwave irradiation. The reduction of sulphur exceed 85 %. The reaction time was drastically reduced by the microwave irradiation as compared with the external heating method...|$|R
25|$|A major {{drawback}} {{of using}} coal as a fuel source is the emission {{of carbon dioxide}} and other pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and particulates. Almost all coal-fired power plants use <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> combustion, which grinds the coal to increase the surface area, burns it to make steam, and runs the steam through a turbine to generate electricity. <b>Pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> plants can only capture carbon dioxide after combustion when it is diluted and harder to separate. In comparison, gasification in IGCC allows for separation and capture of the concentrated and pressurized carbon dioxide before combustion. Syngas cleanup includes filters to remove bulk particulates, scrubbing to remove fine particulates, and solid adsorbents for mercury removal. Additionally, hydrogen gas is used as fuel, which produces no pollutants under combustion.|$|E
25|$|The {{potential}} benefit of retrofitting has so far, not offset {{the cost of}} IGCC with carbon capture technology. A 2013 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration demonstrates that the overnight cost of IGCC with CCS has increased 19% since 2010. Amongst the three power plant types, <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> with CCS has an overnight capital cost of $5,227 (2012 dollars)/kW, IGCC with CCS has an overnight capital cost of $6,599 (2012 dollars)/kW, and natural gas combined cycle with CCS has an overnight capital cost of $2,095 (2012 dollars)/kW. <b>Pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> and NGCC costs did not change significantly since 2010. The report further relates that the 19% increase in IGCC cost is due to recent information from IGCC projects that have gone over budget and cost more than expected.|$|E
25|$|Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) was {{the core}} {{technology}} behind FutureGen. IGCC power plants use two turbines – a gas and a steam turbine – to produce electric power {{more efficiently than}} <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> plants.

40|$|We {{established}} a novel experiment {{to study the}} ignition of <b>pulverized</b> <b>coals</b> under conditions relevant to utility boilers. Specifically, we determined the ignition mechanism of pulverized-coal particles under various conditions of particle size, coal type, and freestream oxygen concentration. We also measured the ignition rate constant of a Pittsburgh # 8 high-volatile bituminous coal by direct measurement of the particle temperature at ignition, and incorporating this measurement into a mathematical model for the ignition process. The model, called Distributed Activation Energy Model of Ignition, was developed previously by our group to interpret conventional drop-tube ignition experiments, and was modified to accommodate the present study...|$|R
50|$|Coal dust {{is a fine}} {{powdered}} form of coal, {{which is}} created by the crushing, grinding, or <b>pulverizing</b> of <b>coal.</b> Because of the brittle nature of coal, coal dust can be created during mining, transportation, or by mechanically handling coal.|$|R

Research shows that: The burnout time of Fujian anthracite of particle size between 20 ∼ 75 μm is 0. 5 ∼ 2. 5 s at the ambient temperature of 1100 °C, and that of Yangquan anthracite of particle size between 20 ∼ 75 μm is 0. 3 ∼ 1 s at the ambient temperature of 1200 °C...|$|R
25|$|A new {{generation}} of IGCC-based coal-fired power plants has been proposed, although none is yet under construction. Projects are being developed by AEP, Duke Energy, and Southern Company in the US, and in Europe by ZAK/PKE, Centrica (UK), E.ON and RWE (both Germany) and NUON (Netherlands). In Minnesota, the state's Dept. of Commerce analysis found IGCC to have the highest cost, with an emissions profile not significantly better than <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal.</b> In Delaware, the Delmarva and state consultant analysis had essentially the same results.|$|E
25|$|Doosan Babcock has {{modified}} their Clean Combustion Test Facility (CCTF) in Renfrew, Scotland {{to create}} the largest Oxyfuel test facility currently in the world. Oxyfuel firing on <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> with recycled flue gas demonstrates the operation of a full scale 40 MW burner for use in coal-fired boilers. Sponsors of the project include the UK Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR,) {{as well as a}} group of industrial sponsors and university partners comprising Scottish and Southern Energy (Prime Sponsor), E.ON UK PLC, Drax Power Limited, ScottishPower, EDF Energy, Dong Energy Generation, Air Products Plc (Sponsors), and Imperial College and University of Nottingham (University Partners).|$|E
25|$|Plants {{designed}} for lignite (brown coal) are increasingly used in locations {{as varied as}} Germany, Victoria, Australia and North Dakota. Lignite is a much younger form of coal than black coal. It has a lower energy density than black coal and requires a much larger furnace for equivalent heat output. Such coals may contain up to 70% water and ash, yielding lower furnace temperatures and requiring larger induced-draft fans. The firing systems also differ from black coal and typically draw hot gas from the furnace-exit level and mix it with the incoming coal in fan-type mills that inject the <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> and hot gas mixture into the boiler.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for the quantification of the ignitability of <b>pulverized</b> <b>coals</b> and coal blends using an advanced flame monitoring system. Twenty-two different ranks of coals and coal blends {{were tested in}} a drop tube furnace.

A set of ignition index data for the coals tested were then determined. It is found that the overall ignition index is an effective indication of the ignitability of a coal.

40|$|There {{is a risk}} of {{coal dust}} {{explosion}} to industries mainly in cement processing industries, power plants {{as well as other}} activities associated with handling of <b>pulverized</b> <b>coals.</b> This study aims to investigate the effect of chemical properties of the South East Asian coals on the explosibility of three samples of coal dust which were bituminous Bayan, sub bituminous Tanito and Philippine coals. The minimum explosion concentration (MEC), maximum explosion overpressure (PPmax) and dust deflagration index (K) were determined to compare the fundamental data on coal dust characteristics. The explosion experiment was carried out in a Siwek 20 L spherical chamber. The chemical properties of investigated coals such as moisture content, volatile content, fixed carbon content and ash content were analysed by proximate analysis and Thermogravimery analysis (TGA).

25|$|Fly ash {{material}} solidifies while {{suspended in}} the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags. Since the particles solidify rapidly while {{suspended in the}} exhaust gases, fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and {{range in size from}} 0.5 µm to 300µm. The major consequence of the rapid cooling is that few minerals have time to crystallize, and that mainly amorphous, quenched glass remains. Nevertheless, some refractory phases in the <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> do not melt (entirely), and remain crystalline. In consequence, fly ash is a heterogeneous material. SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and occasionally CaO are the main chemical components present in fly ashes. The mineralogy of fly ashes is very diverse. The main phases encountered are a glass phase, together with quartz, mullite and the iron oxides hematite, magnetite and/or maghemite. Other phases often identified are cristobalite, anhydrite, free lime, periclase, calcite, sylvite, halite, portlandite, rutile and anatase. The Ca-bearing minerals anorthite, gehlenite, akermanite and various calcium silicates and calcium aluminates identical to those found in Portland cement can be identified in Ca-rich fly ashes.|$|E
25|$|The {{high cost}} of IGCC is the biggest {{obstacle}} to its integration in the power market; however, most energy executives recognize that carbon regulation is coming soon. Bills requiring carbon reduction are being proposed again both the House and the Senate, and with the Democratic majority {{it seems likely that}} with the next President there will be a greater push for carbon regulation. The Supreme Court decision requiring the EPA to regulate carbon (Commonwealth of Massachusetts et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency et al.) also speaks to the likelihood of future carbon regulations coming sooner, rather than later. With carbon capture, the cost of electricity from an IGCC plant would increase approximately 33%. For a natural gas CC, the increase is approximately 46%. For a <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal</b> plant, the increase is approximately 57%. This potential for less expensive carbon capture makes IGCC an attractive choice for keeping low cost coal an available fuel source in a carbon constrained world. However, the industry needs a lot more experience to reduce the risk premium. IGCC with CCS requires some sort of mandate, higher carbon market price, or regulatory framework to properly incentivize the industry.|$|E

30|$|Drilling fluid {{contacts}} with the surface of coal and fractures fully during the drilling process for CBM, its pH has direct impact on the wettability of coal, affecting the seepage of CBM further (Zhang and Wang 2000).

In order to solve this problem, the paper discusses the change law of coal’s wettability changing with the drilling fluid’s pH value combined with the experiments of <b>pulverized</b> <b>coal’s</b> self-priming, which has important practical significance for selecting drilling fluid and optimizing fluid performance, and it contributes to protect the CBM reservoir and increase the production of CBM.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} experimental {{investigations into}} the ignition behaviors of <b>pulverized</b> <b>coals</b> and coal blends in a drop tube furnace using a flame monitoring system. Seven different ranks of coals and coal blends of different mixing proportion were tested. Characteristic parameters including relative ignition temperature, maximum ignition points, oscillation frequency, fluctuation ratio and combustion dynamic energy were determined from the flame monitoring system. The ignition behaviours of the coals are established by combining the parameters. Results demonstrate that the parameters are suitable for distinguishing ignition behaviors from homogeneous, hetero-homogeneous to heterogeneous in the ignition section of a drop tube furnace. The ignition behaviors of a coal blend are found to have similar characteristics as the coal of higher volatile matter in the blend and depend on its proportion in the blend.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a solution for}} the detection and control of coal loads that is more accurate and convenient than those currently used. To date, no research has addressed {{the use of a}} grinding medium as the controlled parameter. To improve the accuracy of the coal load detection based on the kinetic energy of balls in a tubular ball mill, a Discrete Element Method (DEM) model for ball kinematics based on coal loads is proposed. The operating process for a ball mill and the ball motion, as influenced by the coal quality and the coal load, was analyzed carefully. The relationship between the operating efficiency of a <b>coal</b> <b>pulverizing</b> system, <b>coal</b> loads, and the balls’ kinetic energy was obtained. Origin and Matlab were utilized to draw the variation of parameters with increasing coal loads in the projectile and cascading motion states. The parameters include the balls’ real-time kinetic energy, the friction energy consumption, and the mill’s total work. Meanwhile, a method of balanced adjacent degree and a physical experiment were proposed to verify the considerable effect of the balls’ kinetic energy on coal loads. The model and experiment results indicate that a coal load control method based on the balls’ kinetic energy is therefore feasible for the optimized operation of a <b>coal</b> <b>pulverizing</b> system...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{observation}} of pulsed-laser ignition and combustion of <b>pulverized</b> <b>coals</b> {{with a high}} speed video has been made. A dilute stream of particles was dropped into a laminar, upward-flow wind tunnel with a quartz test section. The gas stream was not preheated. A single pulse from a Nd:YAG laser was focused through the tunnel and ignited several particles. The transparent test section and cool walls allowed for optical detection of the reaction sequence. The ignition and combustion behaviours of amorphous carbon spheres and an anthracite were as expected for heterogeneous ignition and reaction. Surprisingly, the reaction of a high volatile bituminous and a subbituminous coal exhibited two broad emissions, as detected with a photomultiplier tube. For these coals, high speed videos revealed that two successive clouds of volatiles surrounded the particles, and each cloud was associated {{with one of the}} broad emissions. It is hypothesized that the first cloud was due to the evolution and reaction of tar, and the second resulted from low molecular weight, combustible gases. The subbituminous and bituminous coals apparently ignited heterogeneously, and possible explanations for this are discussed...|$|R
