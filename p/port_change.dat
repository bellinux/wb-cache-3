40|$|Software forking—creatingavariantproductbycopyingand modifying an {{existing}} product—is often considered an ad hoc, low cost alternative to principled product line development. To maintain such forked products, developers often need to port {{an existing}} feature or bug-fix from one product variant to another. As {{a first step}} towards assessing whether forkingisasustainablepractice, weconductanin-depthcase study of 18 years of the BSD product family history. Our study finds that maintaining forked projects involves significant effort of porting patches from other projects. Crosssystem porting happens periodically and the porting rate does not necessarily decrease over time. A significant portion of active developers participate in <b>porting</b> <b>changes</b> from peer projects. Surprisingly, <b>ported</b> <b>changes</b> are less defectprone than non-ported changes. Our work {{is the first to}} comprehensively characterize the temporal, spatial, and developer dimensions of cross-system porting in the BSD family, and our tool Repertoire is the first automated tool for detecting ported edits with high accuracy of 94 % precision and 84 % recall. Our study finds that the upkeep work of <b>porting</b> <b>changes</b> from peer projects is significant and currently, porting practice seems to heavily depend on developers doing their porting job on time. This result calls for new techniques to automate cross-system porting to reduce the maintenance cost of forked projects...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} classify {{and identify the}} network traffic associated with different applications is a central issue for many network operation and research topics including Quality of Service enforcement, traffic engineering, security, monitoring and intrusion-detection. However, traditional classification approaches for traffic to higher-level application mapping, such as those based on port or payload analysis, are highly inaccurate for many emerging applications and hence useless in actual networks. This paper presents a recurrence plot-based traffic classification approach based on the analysis of non-stationary "hidden" transition patterns of IP traffic flows. Such nonlinear properties cannot be affected by payload encryption or dynamic <b>port</b> <b>change</b> and hence cannot be easily masqueraded. In performing a quantitative assessment of the above transition patterns, we used recurrence quantification analysis, a nonlinear technique widely used in many fields of science to discover the time correlations and the hidden dynamics of statistical time series. Our model proved to be effective for providing a deterministic interpretation of recurrence patterns derived by complex protocol dynamics in end-to-end traffic flows, and hence for developing qualitative and quantitative observations that can be reliably used in traffic classification.
