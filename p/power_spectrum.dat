This means that without an accurate model of diffusion damping, scientists cannot judge {{the relative merits of}} cosmological models, whose theoretical predictions cannot be compared with observational data, this data being obscured by damping effects. For example, the peaks in the <b>power</b> <b>spectrum</b> due to acoustic oscillations are decreased in amplitude by diffusion damping.

25|$|The {{detailed}} analysis of CMBR data to produce maps, an angular <b>power</b> <b>spectrum,</b> and ultimately cosmological parameters is a complicated, computationally difficult problem. Although computing a <b>power</b> <b>spectrum</b> from a map is in principle a simple Fourier transform, decomposing {{the map of the}} sky into spherical harmonics, in practice it is hard to take the effects of noise and foreground sources into account. In particular, these foregrounds are dominated by galactic emissions such as Bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and dust that emit in the microwave band; in practice, the galaxy has to be removed, resulting in a CMB map that is not a full-sky map. In addition, point sources like galaxies and clusters represent another source of foreground which must be removed so as not to distort the short scale structure of the CMB <b>power</b> <b>spectrum.</b>|$|E

It is custom in {{helioseismology}} {{to assume}} that the <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> of time series of solar radial velocity or of solar in-tensity have a χ 2 with 2 degrees of freedom statistics. This assumption is regularly used in helioseismology for using Maximum Likelihood Estimators for single <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> with that assumed statistics. When independent <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> are added, it is also custom {{to assume that}} the resulting <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution. Here we show that this approximation is irrelevant, and that the software code developed for fitting single <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> can be used without any approximation after proper normalization of the added <b>power</b> <b>spectra...</b>|$|R

In this paper, the flow angle dependences of the PAD <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> are investigated using an experiment setup that was established based on intensity-modulated continuous wave laser excitation. The setup has an overall configuration {{that is similar to}} a previously reported configuration, but is more sophisticated in that it accurately aligns the laser illumination with the ultrasound detection process, and in that it picks up the correct sample position. In the analysis of the <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> data, we find that the background <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> can be extracted by combining the output signals from the two channels of the lock-in amplifier, which is very useful for identification of the PAD <b>power</b> <b>spectra.</b> The <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> are presented and analyzed in opposite flow directions, at different flow speeds, and at different flow angles.

40|$|We have {{performed}} power spectral analysis of surface temperatures, velocities, and magnetic fields, using spectro-polarimetric data {{taken with the}} Hinode Solar Optical Telescope. When we make <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> in a field-of-view covering the super-granular scale, kinetic and thermal <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> have a prominent peak at the granular scale while the magnetic <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> have a broadly distributed power over various spatial scales with weak peaks at both the granular and supergranular scales. To study the <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> separately in internetwork and network regions, <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> are derived in small sub-regions extracted from the field-of-view. We examine slopes of the <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> using power-law indices, and compare them with the unsigned magnetic flux density averaged in the sub-regions. The thermal and kinetic spectra are steeper than the magnetic ones at the sub-granular scale in the internetwork regions, and the power-law indices differ by about 2. The power-law indices of the magnetic <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> are close to or smaller than - 1 at that scale, which suggests the total magnetic energy mainly comes from either the granular scale magnetic structures or both the granular scale and smaller ones contributing evenly. The slopes of the thermal and kinetic <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> become less steep with increasing unsigned flux density in the network regions. The power-law indices of all the thermal, kinetic, and magnetic <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> become similar when the unsigned flux density is larger than 200 Mx cm^- 2.

40|$|Weak lensing {{surveys that}} can {{potentially}} place strong constraints on dark energy parameters {{can only do}} so if the source redshift means and error distributions are very well known. We investigate prospects for controlling errors in these quantities by exploiting their influence on the <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> of the galaxies. Although, from the galaxy <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> alone, sufficiently precise and simultaneous determination of redshift biases and variances is not possible, a strong consistency test is. Given the redshift error rms, galaxy <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> can be used to determine the mean redshift of a group of galaxies to subpercent accuracy. Although galaxy <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> cannot be used to determine the redshift error rms, they can be used to determine this rms divided by the Hubble parameter, a quantity that may be even more valuable for interpretation of cosmic shear data than the rms itself. We also show that galaxy <b>power</b> <b>spectra,</b> due to the baryonic acoustic oscillations, can potentially lead to constraints on dark energy that are competitive with those due to the cosmic shear <b>power</b> <b>spectra</b> from the same survey.

25|$|Temporal {{filtering}} is {{the removal}} of frequencies of no interest from the signal. A voxel's intensity change over time can be represented as the sum {{of a number of}} different repeating waves with differing periods and heights. A plot with these periods on the x-axis and the heights on the y-axis is called a <b>power</b> <b>spectrum,</b> and this plot is created with the Fourier transform technique. Temporal filtering amounts to removing the periodic waves not of interest to us from the <b>power</b> <b>spectrum,</b> and then summing the waves back again, using the inverse Fourier transform to create a new timecourse for the voxel. A high-pass filter removes the lower frequencies, and the lowest frequency that can be identified with this technique is the reciprocal of twice the TR.

40|$|A {{stochastic}} {{gravitational wave}} background (SGWB) would gravitationally lens {{the cosmic microwave}} background (CMB) photons. We find that the lensing due to gravitational waves(GW) is more efficient as compared to lensing due to scalar density perturbations.

25|$|In June 2001, NASA {{launched}} a second CMB space mission, WMAP, {{to make much}} more precise measurements of the large scale anisotropies over the full sky. WMAP used symmetric, rapid-multi-modulated scanning, rapid switching radiometers to minimize non-sky signal noise.

25|$|The UV Index is {{a number}} linearly related to the {{intensity}} of sunburn-producing UV radiation at a given point on the earth's surface. It cannot be simply related to the irradiance (measured in W/m2) because the UV of greatest concern occupies a spectrum of wavelength from 295 to 325nm, and shorter wavelengths have already been absorbed a great deal when they arrive at the earth's surface. Skin damage from sunburn, however, is related to wavelength, the shorter wavelengths being much more damaging. The UV <b>power</b> <b>spectrum</b> (expressed as Watts per square metre per nanometre of wavelength) is therefore multiplied by a weighting curve known as the erythemal action spectrum, and the result integrated over the whole spectrum. This gave Canadian scientists a weighted figure (sometimes called Diffey-weighted UV irradiance, or DUV, or erythemal dose rate) typically around 250mW/m2 in midday summer sunlight. So, they arbitrarily divided by 25mW/m2 to generate a convenient index value, essentially a scale of 0 to 11+ (though ozone depletion is now resulting in higher values, as mentioned above).|$|E
25|$|Baryon {{acoustic}} oscillations (BAO) are regular, {{periodic fluctuations}} in {{the density of the}} visible baryonic matter (normal matter) of the universe. These are predicted to arise in the Lambda-CDM model due to the early universe's acoustic oscillations in the photon-baryon fluid and can be observed in the cosmic microwave background angular <b>power</b> <b>spectrum.</b> BAOs set up a preferred length scale for baryons. As the dark matter and baryons clumped together after recombination, the effect is much weaker in the galaxy distribution in the nearby universe, but is detectable as a subtle (~ 1 percent) preference for pairs of galaxies to be separated by 147 Mpc, compared to those separated by 130 or 160 Mpc. This feature was predicted theoretically in the 1990s and then discovered in 2005, in two large galaxy redshift surveys, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. Combining the CMB observations with BAO measurements from galaxy redshift surveys provides a precise estimate of the Hubble constant and the average matter density in the Universe. The results support the Lambda-CDM model.|$|E
