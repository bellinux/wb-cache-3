5|$|Dani {{had more}} than 30 {{published}} books and numerous journal articles to his credit. He spoke 35 languages and dialects, and was fluent in Bengali, French, Hindi, Kashmiri, Marathi, <b>Pashto,</b> Persian, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Saraiki, Sindhi, Tamil, Turkish, English and Urdu languages. He also published various texts {{in most of these}} languages.|$|E
5|$|After {{an absence}} of ten years, and almost 30 years after the 1983 movie Big Bird in China, 53 eleven-minute episodes of Sesame Street's Big Bird Looks at the World, filmed in Mandarin Chinese, debuted in early 2011 in China. Inspired by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, the program {{emphasized}} emergency preparedness. In {{the first week of}} December 2011, a <b>Pashto</b> and Dari-language version called Baghch-e-Simsim was launched in Afghanistan, and in the same month Pakistan began airing its own Urdu-language version, called SimSim Humara, which was supposed to run for three years. In June 2012, the United States terminated funding for SimSim Humara due to serious allegations of corruption by the local Pakistani puppet theater working on the initiative.|$|E
5|$|Contact between English and {{immigrant}} languages {{has given rise}} to new accents and dialects. For instance, the variety of English spoken by Poles in Manchester is distinct both from typical Polish-accented English and from Mancunian. At a local level, the diversity of immigrant communities means that some languages that are extremely rare in {{the country as a whole}} have strongholds in Northern towns: <b>Pashto</b> is spoken natively by 0.08% of the population of England but 0.7% of the population of Bradford, while Cantonese is the first language of 0.4% of the population of Manchester compared to 0.08% nationally.|$|E
5|$|Fluent in <b>Pashto,</b> English, and Urdu, Yousafzai {{was educated}} mostly by her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, {{who is a}} poet, school owner, and an {{educational}} activist himself, running a chain of private schools known as the Khushal Public School. She once stated to an interviewer that {{she would like to}} become a doctor, though later her father encouraged her to become a politician instead. Ziauddin referred to his daughter as something entirely special, allowing her to stay up at night and talk about politics after her two brothers had been sent to bed.|$|E
5|$|In Peshawar, satyagraha {{was led by}} a Muslim <b>Pashto</b> {{disciple of}} Gandhi, Ghaffar Khan, who had trained 50,000 nonviolent activists called Khudai Khidmatgar. On 23 April 1930, Ghaffar Khan was arrested. A crowd of Khudai Khidmatgar {{gathered}} in Peshawar's Kissa Khani (Storytellers) Bazaar. The British ordered troops of 2/18 battalion of Royal Garhwal Rifles to open fire with machine guns on the unarmed crowd, killing an estimated 200–250. The Pashtun satyagrahis acted in accord with their training in nonviolence, willingly facing bullets as the troops fired on them. One British Indian Army Soldier Chandra Singh Garwali and troops of the renowned Royal Garhwal Rifles, refused to fire at the crowds. The entire platoon was arrested and many received heavy penalties, including life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|The Emir's brother, Prime Minister Nasrullah Khan, {{was a man}} of {{religious}} convictions. Unlike the Emir, he fluently spoke <b>Pashto</b> (the local language), dressed in traditional Afghan robes, and interacted more closely with the border tribes. While the Emir favoured British India, Nasrullah Khan was more pro-German in his sympathies. Nasrullah's views were shared by his nephew, Amanullah Khan, the youngest and most charismatic of the Emir's sons. The eldest son, Inayatullah Khan, {{was in charge of the}} Afghan army. The mission therefore expected more sympathy and consideration from Nasrullah and Amanullah than from the emir.|$|E
5|$|Karmal {{was born}} Sultan Hussein on 6 January 1929, {{was the son}} of Muhammad Hussein Hashem, a Major General in the Afghan Army and former {{governor}} of the province of Paktia, and was the second of five siblings. His family was one of the wealthier families in Kabul. His ethnic background is disputed, some claim that he was Tajik who represented himself as a Ghilzai Pashtun but others claim that he descended from Hindu ancestors of Kashmir. In 1986, Karmal announced that he, and his brother Mahmud Baryalay, were Pashtun because their mother came from the Mullakhel branch of the Pashtuns. However, this was controversial, considering that lineage in Afghanistan is supposed to be traced through the father, not the mother. The accusation that he was of Indian Muslim ancestry {{comes from the fact that}} his birthname, Sultan Hussein, is a common Indian Muslim name. In addition, Karmal's own father denied his own ethnicity; Karmal's father was a Tajik. To further confuse the matter, Karmal spoke Dari (Persian) and not <b>Pashto.</b>|$|E
25|$|Northern <b>Pashto,</b> {{also called}} Eastern <b>Pashto,</b> is the {{prestige}} variety of <b>Pashto</b> in eastern and northeastern Afghanistan, and {{northern part of}} the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. This dialect is almost identical to Yusufzai <b>Pashto.</b>|$|E
25|$|Literary <b>Pashto,</b> or High <b>Pashto</b> standard, is the {{standardized}} variety of <b>Pashto</b> developed by Radio Television Afghanistan and Academy of Sciences of Afghanistan in Kabul. Its phonetics {{are based on}} the Central <b>Pashto</b> dialect (also called Northwestern <b>Pashto),</b> which is spoken in the central Ghilji region, but its vocabulary also derives from Southern <b>Pashto.</b> It has adopted neologisms to coin new terms from already existing words or phrases and introduce them into the <b>Pashto</b> lexicon. Educated Standard <b>Pashto</b> is learned in the curriculum that is taught in the primary schools in the country. It is used for written and formal spoken purposes, and in the domains of media and government.|$|E
25|$|Southern <b>Pashto,</b> {{also called}} Kandahari <b>Pashto,</b> is the {{prestige}} variety of <b>Pashto</b> in southern and western Afghanistan, and the Balochistan province of Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|Yusufzai <b>Pashto,</b> {{also called}} Peshawari or Northeastern <b>Pashto,</b> is the {{prestige}} variety of <b>Pashto</b> in central, northern, and eastern {{parts of the}} Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pashto</b> {{employs the}} <b>Pashto</b> alphabet, a {{modified}} {{form of the}} Perso-Arabic alphabet. It has extra letters for Pashto-specific sounds. Since the 17th century, <b>Pashto</b> has been primarily written in the Naskh script, rather than the Nasta'liq script used for Urdu alphabet and, to some degree, the Persian alphabet.|$|E
25|$|Faizani speaks <b>Pashto,</b> Persian, and Arabic. His son, Ustad Mazhabi Sahib (the present {{leader of}} Madrassa-e Tawheed), speaks <b>Pashto,</b> Persian, Arabic, and English.|$|E
25|$|According to 19th-century {{linguist}} James Darmesteter {{and modern}} linguist Michael M. T. Henderson, <b>Pashto</b> is “descended from Avestan”, but Georg Morgenstierne {{says they are}} merely closely related. The Rabatak inscription of Emperor Kanishka written in Bactrian and Greek contains words are borrowed from <b>Pashto</b> language due to their proximity to the modern <b>Pashto</b> language.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pashto</b> {{media has}} {{expanded}} {{in the last}} decade, {{with a number of}} <b>Pashto</b> TV channels becoming available. Two of the popular ones are the Pakistan-based AVT Khyber and <b>Pashto</b> One. Pashtuns around the world, particularly those in Arab countries, watch these for entertainment purposes and to get latest news about their native areas. Others are Afghanistan-based Shamshad TV, Radio Television Afghanistan, and Lemar TV, which has a special children's show called Baghch-e-Simsim. International news sources that provide <b>Pashto</b> programs include BBC and Voice of America.|$|E
25|$|Urdu and English {{are the two}} {{official}} {{languages of}} Pakistan. <b>Pashto</b> has no official status at the federal level. On a provincial level, <b>Pashto</b> is the regional language of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Federally Administered Tribal Areas and northern Balochistan. The primary medium of education in government schools in Pakistan is Urdu, but from 2014 onwards, the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has placed more emphasis on English as the medium of instruction. English-medium private schools in Pashto-speaking areas, however, generally do not use <b>Pashto.</b> The imposition of Urdu as the primary medium of education in public schools has caused a systematic degradation and decline of many of Pakistan's native languages including <b>Pashto.</b> This has caused growing resentment amongst Pashtuns, who also complain that <b>Pashto</b> is often neglected officially.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pashto</b> and Dari are the {{official}} languages of Afghanistan; bilingualism is very common. Dari, which is Afghanistan's Persian, functions as the lingua franca in Kabul {{as well as}} in much of the northern and northwestern parts of the country. <b>Pashto</b> is the native tongue of the Pashtuns, although many of them are also fluent in Dari while some non-Pashtuns are fluent in <b>Pashto.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Pashto</b> is {{a provincial}} {{language}} spoken {{as a first}} language by about 15% of Pakistanis, mostly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and in Balochistan {{as well as by}} immigrants to the eastern provinces who are often not counted due to census irregularities. The <b>Pashto</b> has rich written literary traditions as well as an oral tradition. There are two major dialect patterns within which the various individual dialects may be classified; these are Pakhto, which is the Northern (Peshawar) variety, and the softer <b>Pashto</b> spoken in the southern areas. Khushal Khan Khattak (1613–1689) and Rahman Baba (1633–1708) were the most famous poets in the <b>Pashto</b> language. In {{the last part of the}} 20th century, Pakhto or <b>Pashto</b> has produced some great poets like Ghani Khan, Khatir Afridi and Amir Hamza Shinwari. There are also many Pakistanis from the adjacent regions of Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan who are conversant in <b>Pashto</b> and count it as their second language. They are not included in the overall percentage.|$|E
25|$|Fluency in <b>Pashto</b> {{is often}} the main {{determinant}} of group acceptance as to who is considered a Pashtun. Pashtun nationalism emerged following the rise of <b>Pashto</b> poetry that linked language and ethnic identity. <b>Pashto</b> has national status in Afghanistan and regional status in neighboring Pakistan. In addition to their native tongue, many Pashtuns are fluent in Urdu, Dari, and English. Throughout their history, poets, prophets, kings and warriors {{have been among the}} most revered members of Pashtun society. Early written records of <b>Pashto</b> began to appear around the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} poetry helped {{transition}} <b>Pashto</b> {{to the modern}} period. <b>Pashto</b> literature gained significant prominence in the 20th century, with poetry by Ameer Hamza Shinwari who developed <b>Pashto</b> Ghazals. In 1919, during the expanding of mass media, Mahmud Tarzi published Seraj-al-Akhbar, which became the first <b>Pashto</b> newspaper in Afghanistan. In 1977, Khan Roshan Khan wrote Tawarikh-e-Hafiz Rehmatkhani which contains the family trees and Pashtun tribal names. Some notable poets include Khushal Khan Khattak, Afzal Khan Khattak, Ajmal Khattak, Pareshan Khattak, Rahman Baba, Nazo Anaa, Hamza Shinwari, Ahmad Shah Durrani, Timur Shah Durrani, Shuja Shah Durrani, Ghulam Muhammad Tarzi, and Ghani Khan.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pashto</b> {{belongs to}} the Northeastern Iranian group of the Indo-Iranian branch, but Ethnologue lists it as Southeastern Iranian. <b>Pashto</b> has two main dialect groups, “soft” and “hard”, the latter known as Pakhto.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pashto</b> dialects {{are divided}} into two varieties, the “soft” {{southern}} variety Paṣ̌tō, and the “hard” northern variety Pax̌tō (Pakhtu). Each variety is further divided {{into a number of}} dialects. The southern dialect of Wanetsi is the most distinctive <b>Pashto</b> dialect.|$|E
25|$|The primary native {{languages}} {{spoken in}} Peshawar are <b>Pashto</b> and Hindko, though English {{is used in}} the city's educational institutions, while Urdu is almost universally understood throughout the city,. <b>Pashto</b> is used as a language of instruction in the province's public schools.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pashto</b> has a retroflex lateral flap.|$|E
25|$|From the 16th century, <b>Pashto</b> poetry {{become very}} popular among the Pashtuns. Some {{of those who}} wrote poetry in <b>Pashto</b> are Pir Roshan, Khushal Khan Khattak, Rahman Baba, Nazo Tokhi, and Ahmad Shah Durrani, founder of the modern state of Afghanistan or the Durrani Empire.|$|E
25|$|As a {{national}} language of Afghanistan, <b>Pashto</b> is primarily spoken in the east, south, and southwest, {{but also in}} some northern and western parts of the country. The exact numbers of speakers are unavailable, but different estimates show that <b>Pashto</b> is the mother tongue of 80–90%of {{the total population of}} Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|The word Zalmi is a <b>Pashto</b> {{language}} {{word meaning}} youth.|$|E

25|$|In <b>Pashto,</b> most of {{the native}} {{elements}} of the lexicon are related to other Eastern Iranian languages. However, a remarkably large number of words are unique to <b>Pashto.</b> Post-7th century borrowings came primarily from the Persian and Hindustani languages, with some Arabic words being borrowed through those two languages, but sometimes directly. Modern speech borrows words from English, French and German.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pashto,</b> Yidgha and Wakhi are Eastern Iranian {{languages}} {{spoken in}} Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and the Gilgit–Baltistan region of Pakistan. Balochi spoken in Balochistan {{is classified as}} a members of the Northwestern Iranian languages. If combined, Iranian peoples who speak <b>Pashto,</b> Balochi, Yidgha and Wakhi comprise about 18% {{of the population of}} Pakistan, and are concentrated in the northwest and west of Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|About 111 verses were {{translated}} into English Rhyme {{and published by}} Arbab Hidayatullah, himself a Ghoryakhel Mohmand, in 2009. The original <b>Pashto</b> version has been transliterated into the Roman alphabet {{in order to make}} it easier to read for those who can not read the <b>Pashto</b> alphabet. This translation, with a tilt to the romantic side of Rahman Baba's poetry, has been very well received.|$|E
25|$|Ǵǵ and Źź {{are used}} in <b>Pashto</b> in the Latin alphabet, {{equivalent}} to ږ and ځ, respectively.|$|E
25|$|They {{are headed}} {{with the words}} of the <b>Pashto</b> {{language}} that signify individual or collective Pashtun tribal functions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pashto</b> {{which is}} spoken in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and FATA of Pakistan and Afghanistan is an Iranian language.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>Pashto</b> language, {{the word}} for comrade is malgury. It is used by and refers to communists, socialists, or {{supporters}} of the communist system across the Durand Line (i.e. in Afghanistan and Pakistan) by <b>Pashto</b> speakers. For {{the last decade or}} so it has also been used by the nationalists. The word is also used by common people both male and female for a very close friend.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pashto</b> is a subject–object–verb (SOV) {{language}} with split ergativity. Adjectives come before nouns. Nouns and adjectives are inflected for two genders (masc./fem.), two numbers (sing./plur.), and four cases (direct, oblique I, oblique II and vocative). There {{is also an}} inflection for the subjunctive mood. The verb system is very intricate with the following tenses: present, simple past, past progressive, present perfect and past perfect. The sentence construction of <b>Pashto</b> has similarities with some other Indo-Iranian languages such as Prakrit and Bactrian. The possessor precedes the possessed in the genitive construction. The verb generally agrees with the subject in both transitive and intransitive sentences. An exception occurs when a completed action is reported {{in any of the}} past tenses (simple past, past progressive, present perfect or past perfect). In such cases, the verb agrees with the subject if it is intransitive, but if it is transitive, it agrees with the object, therefore <b>Pashto</b> shows a partly ergative behavior. Like Kurdish, but unlike most other Indo-Iranian languages, <b>Pashto</b> uses all three types of adpositions – prepositions, postpositions and circumpositions.|$|E
