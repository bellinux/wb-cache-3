Aim {{of the present study was}} to determine whether changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression occur in response to activating stimuli and whether this affects activity and composition of platelet transcriptome and proteome. Purified <b>platelet-rich</b> <b>plasmas</b> from healthy volunteers were collected and activated with ADP, collagen, or thrombin receptor activating peptide. Transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq revealed that platelet transcriptome remained largely unaffected within the first 2 hours of stimulation. In contrast, quantitative proteomics showed that almost half of >[*] 700 proteins quantified were modulated under the same conditions. Global miRNA analysis indicated that reorganisation of platelet proteome occurring during activation reflected changes in mature miRNA expression, which therefore, appears to be the main driver of the observed discrepancy between transcriptome and proteome changes. Platelet functions significantly affected by modulated miRNAs include, among others, the integrin/cytoskeletal, coagulation and inflammatory-immune response pathways. These results demonstrate a significant reprogramming of the platelet miRNome during activation, with consequent significant changes in platelet proteome and provide for the first time substantial evidence that fine-tuning of resident mRNA translation by miRNAs is a key event in platelet pathophysiology...|$|R

Human C 1 q suppressed the collagen-induced platelet aggregation in human <b>platelet-rich</b> <b>plasmas.</b> Both human C 1 q and a suspension in insoluble bovine collagen inhibited in time-dependent fashion the lysis of sensitized sheep erythrocytes (EA) by guinea-pig complement. They both agglutinated sheep erythrocytes (EA and EAC 4) sensitized with rabbit haemolysin, {{mainly in the}} IgM type, polystyrene latex particles complexed with heat-denatured human IgG, a combination of horse, goat and sheep globulins, or deoxyribonucleoprotein. Heating of C 1 q and collagen (56 degrees C, 30 min), which disrupts the collagen fold into a random coil structure, almost completely abrogated all activities of C 1 q and considerably reduced those of collagen, suggesting that an intact triple helix is essential for their activities. In spite of their far-ranging similarities, C 1 q was more potent by weight in most reactions, showed evidence of a faster rate of binding to EA, and was more sensitive to heat treatment at 56 degrees C than was collagen. {{on the basis of}} the binding activities of collagen, a model is proposed according to which platelets, sensitized erythrocytes, aggregated gammaglobulins, immune complexes and deoxyribonucleoprotein might accumulate at the site of endothelial damage where blood and its components are exposed to collagenous substances.

40|$|The {{platelet}} {{effect of}} antibody preparations {{known to have}} immunosuppressive action was investigated by a turbidimetric method in vitro. Both horse anti-human thymocyte globulin (HATG) and sheep anti-human beta 2 -microglobulin IgG (SA beta 2 mG) caused the platelets to aggregate in all human <b>platelet-rich</b> <b>plasmas</b> (PRP) tested. The aggregation was usually irreversible and characterized by a sigmoid curve. The action is specific for the antibodies in HATG and SA beta 2 mG because control preparations (horse normal IgG and IgG fractions of sheep normal, anti-dog IgG and anti-human IgA sera) were ineffective; further, heating (30 min at 56 degrees C) and BaSO 4 or Al(OH) 3 adsorption of HATG and SA beta 2 mG did not alter their aggregating capability. When HATG and SA beta 2 mG were added together to PRP, they induced aggregation in a simple additive manner. High antibody doses tended to decrease the extent of aggregation. The effect of platelet count on aggregation varied with both the dose level ('low' or 'high') and type (HATG or SA beta 2 mG) of the inducer antibody. Using fixed submaximal doses, four main aggregation patterns could be recognized among 60 PRP: (i) high responses to both HATG and SA beta 2 mG; (ii) high to HATG, low to SA beta 2 mG; (iii) low to HATG, high to SA beta 2 mG; and (iv) low to both. The results provide guidelines for quantitative aggregation studies with platelet antibodies and suggest that HATG and SA beta 2 mG act through distinct platelet membrane components, the receptor for the latter being the best characterized protein of the mammalian cell membrane...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{leading to}} the hypercoagulability in pancreatic carcinoma is unclear. The rapid progress of the disease after its diagnosis and the inaccessibility of the tumor make studies on the mechanism difficult in man. With the successful induction of this malignancy and conversion of it into an ascites tumor in Syrian golden hamsters, interactions between isolated tumor cells and individual hemostatic components can be investigated. In this paper, studies on in vitro tumor cell-platelet interactions and some hemostatic changes in hamsters following intravenous injection of isolated tumor cells are described. Freshly isolated tumor cells and tumor-cell sonicates, but not those that had been kept at 4 or - 70 C overnight, induced comparable aggregation of human platelets in both heparinized and citrated <b>platelet-rich</b> <b>plasmas</b> (hPRP and cPRP). The aggregation was not followed by clot formation; a specific synthetic thrombin inhibitor {{had no effect on}} the aggregation in either hPRP or cPRP. Washed and gel-filtered platelets, even in the presence of 5 % of citrated or heparinized platelet-poor plasma (cPPP or hPPP) failed to be aggregated by tumor cells. Tumor-cell-induced platelet aggregation was accompanied by thromboxane formation and serotonin release, both of which were several orders of magnitude greater in cPPP than in hPRP. Aspirin, apyrase, and PGI 2 all inhibited tumor-cell-induced platelet aggregation in both PRPs, but the inhibition by aspirin was minimal. Intravenous infusion of isolated tumor cells into normal hamsters resulted in a 50 % reduction of platelet count and a 20 - 30 % decline in antithrombin III and fibrinogen.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Heparin-associated {{antibodies}} (HAAb), in {{the presence}} of heparin, can cause platelet activation and aggregation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess whether a platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, c 7 E 3, would inhibit platelet aggregation {{in the presence}} of HAAb. If aggregation is inhibited by c 7 E 3, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) would be done to determine whether c 7 E 3 interfered with the binding of heparin and the HAAb. Methods: HAAb-positive plasmas from 21 patients (determined by platelet aggregation assays) were studied. Normal donor <b>platelet-rich</b> <b>plasmas</b> (PRP) were incubated (1 minute) with either saline solution or 3 μg/ml of c 7 E 3. Platelet-poor plasma from patients with HAAb and one of three sources of heparin (25 μl, 10 U/ml; porcine heparin, bovine heparin, and low molecular weight heparin [enoxaparin]) were added to the PRP mixture. Aggregation was determined using a platelet aggregometer by measuring time to aggregation, the slope of the aggregation curve, and the percent change in optical density. Results: Platelet aggregation occured in 100 %, 100 %, and 95 % of the saline solution incubations exposed to porcine heparin, bovine heparin, and enoxaparin, respectively. Incubation with c 7 E 3 caused 100 % inhibition of platelet aggregation in plasma exposed to porcine heparin, bovine heparin, and enoxaparin. The optical density curves obtained from the ELISA, which were dependent on the binding of HAAb to heparin, were not significantly different when c 7 E 3 was compared to buffer alone. Conclusions: The GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, c 7 E 3, inhibits HAAb-induced platelet aggregation via a mechanism that does not appear to interfere with the binding between heparin and HAAb. Clinical trials are warranted to assess whether GP IIb/IIIa antagonists may allow patients with HAAb to safely receive heparin. (J Vasc Surg 1997; 25 : 124 - 30. ...|$|R

Trousseau syndrome often occurs with mucinous adenocarcinomas, which secrete abnormally glycosylated mucins and mucin fragments into the bloodstream. Since carcinoma mucins can have binding sites for selectins, we hypothesized that selectin-mucin interactions might trigger this syndrome. When highly purified, tissue-factor free carcinoma mucin preparations were intravenously injected into mice, platelet-rich microthrombi were rapidly generated. This pathology was markedly diminished in P- or L-selectin–deficient mice. Heparin (an antithrombin-potentiating agent that can also block P- and L-selectin recognition of ligands) ameliorated this platelet aggregation, but had no additional effect in P- or L-selectin–deficient mice. Inhibition of endogenous thrombin by recombinant hirudin also did not block platelet aggregation. Mucins generated platelet aggregation in vitro in hirudinized whole blood, but not in <b>platelet-rich</b> leukocyte-free <b>plasma</b> nor in whole blood from L-selectin–deficient mice. Thus, Trousseau syndrome is likely triggered by interactions of circulating carcinoma mucins with leukocyte L-selectin and platelet P-selectin without requiring accompanying thrombin generation.
