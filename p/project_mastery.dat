40|$|In 2011, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation {{created the}} <b>Project</b> <b>Mastery</b> grant program to support competency-based {{education}} initiatives in large school systems that serve {{a high proportion}} of disadvantaged youth.  The three recipient organizationswhich included two large school districts and one intermediary organizationcarried out their pilot programs in a total of 12 public secondary schools distributed across five school districts in four states. The Foundation asked RAND to evaluate these efforts in terms of implementation, students' experiences, and student performance. This report presents final results from that evaluation. It provides an overview of competency-based education and the <b>Project</b> <b>Mastery</b> grant projects and describes the implementation of competency-based educational features under each project. It also reports on student survey data from each of the projects. Finally, it describes the academic performance of students exposed to the sites' competency-based models relative to similar students or schools. The report concludes with six lessons for policy, partnerships, and practice...|$|E
5000|$|Math Academy is {{a program}} founded in {{approximately}} 1994 by Stuart Kumaishi, a mathematics instructor at Santa Cruz High. This ongoing program is for freshmen and sophomores only, and utilizes a highly conceptual approach to learning upper math {{in the high school}} environment. While most math programs spend an entire semester or year on a single subject (e.g. Algebra 2) in Math Academy multiple subjects are studied in parallel throughout the year. Emphasis is on <b>projects,</b> <b>mastery</b> of concepts, and application of principles. Algebra 1 and 2, Geometry, Statistics, Trigonometry, and Calculus are covered. The student may move on to more advanced Calculus and Statistics following the two-year course. In 2009 Stuart Kumaishi was recognized for his excellence in teaching with an [...] "Eddy." [...] This is an educator award given to the top teacher for Santa Cruz City Schools.|$|R

Students spend one semester researching a topic of interest with the close guidance of a faculty adviser. The semester culminates with an extended essay explaining the research, a visual presentation to be displayed in the library, and a 30-minute presentation during Senior Mastery Night.|$|R

40|$|In the {{research}} started within the SINAPSIS {{project of the}} Università degli Studi Suor Orsola Benincasa an underwater stereoscopic scanning aimed at surveying of submerged archaeological sites, integrable to standard systems for geomorphological detection of the coast, has been developed. The project involves the construction of hardware consisting of an aluminum frame supporting a pair of GoPro Hero Black Edition cameras and software {{for the production of}} point clouds and the initial processing of data. The software has features for stereoscopic vision system calibration, reduction of noise and the of distortion of underwater captured images, searching for corresponding points of stereoscopic images using stereo-matching algorithms (dense and sparse), for points cloud generating and filtering. Only after various calibration and survey tests carried out during the excavations envisaged in the <b>project,</b> the <b>mastery</b> of methods for an efficient acquisition of data has been achieved. The current development of the system has allowed generation of portions of digital models of real submerged scenes. A semi-automatic procedure for global registration of partial models is under development as a useful aid for the study and musealization of sites...|$|R

The foundation also organized presentations by leading thinkers and humanitarians such as the Dalai Lama and Buckminster Fuller and hosted an annual conference in theoretical physics, a science in which Erhard was especially interested. These conferences attracted leading names in theoretical physics of the era, including Stephen Hawking, Leonard Susskind and Richard Feynman. [...] Physicist Leonard Susskind who attended some of these conferences writes, [...] "I met Hawking and Gerard 't Hooft in the attic of Werner Erhard's house in San Francisco. Erhard was a fan of Sidney Coleman. Dick Feynman, myself, and David Finkelstein were his gurus. He was very, very smart." ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the practical {{implementation of a}} short range ultrasonic obstruction detection and distance measurement device. By employing an ultrasonic transducer pair for producing ultrasonic sounds and sensing the reflected sound waves, the obstructions are detected. The hardware interface uses an Atmel ATmega 8 AVR microcontroller to facilitate the generation of 40 kHz signal burst which {{is used in the}} transmitter circuit, and also to process the received signal for measuring the time of flight of reflected waves and exact distance of the obstruction. The program for this device is developed in WinAVR, and the code generated is dumped into microcontroller using AVR Studio. Educational aspects of this <b>project</b> include the <b>mastery</b> of a programming language and corresponding tools, the design of a functional and intuitive embedded application, and the development of appropriate hardware to build the device...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the <b>Project</b> to Increase <b>Mastery</b> of Mathematics and Science (PIMMS) is to bring high quality staff development in mathematics and science to teachers of all levels.

The report sets forth the project's future visions along with its goals and objectives, and the effects the project has had on different individuals and institutions committed to science and mathematics education, especially in the past 5 years. The report used interview data collected during the summer of 1995 and additional supportive material provided by the project itself to document general findings. Data indicated that PIMMS plays a pivotal role in promoting significant improvement in the teaching and learning of mathematics and science in schools. I...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the representation of}} odour throughout European literary modernism and other, interrelated fields of cultural production. While the introduction acknowledges Western culture’s traditional subordination of olfaction and smell’s ostensible alienation from language, this study argues that odour and language simultaneously display compelling similarities. Chapter One examines Freud’s influence in determining the modern conception of olfaction, as a figure of comparison with D. H. Lawrence and Bronislaw Malinowski. Freud’s placement of odour as culturally and evolutionarily retrograde is questioned in Chapter Two, which notes the <b>projected</b> technological <b>mastery</b> of olfaction as a trope of utopian fiction, demonstrated {{in the writing of}} Aldous Huxley and John Gloag. Chapter Three shifts away from the identification of malodour as a source of modern anxiety to consider the dual commercial and aesthetic significance of perfume. However, these divergent encodings of odour are unified by literary modernism’s persistent recruitment of olfaction as a metaphorical resource; the language of odour denotes a perceived inarticulable quiddity {{at the heart of the}} aesthetic object, a feature offered theoretical context by the writing of Walter Benjamin. Chapters Four and Five develop the congruence between the formal properties of odour and language by addressing ‘canonical’ modernist literary encodings of olfaction. Proust’s elision of the role of the sensorily-informed writer with that of the translator supports the consonance of language and odour, a contention further extended in Chapter Five, which considers the olfactory representations of Joyce, and his recognition of the ambiguous semiology of odour as a marker of personal identity. Finally, a conclusion emphasises this study’s extension of the field of modernist olfactory representation beyond Joyce and Proust. The shared semiological instability exhibited by odours and language supports the broader recuperation of olfaction as a particularly apposite modernist sense modality...|$|R
