5|$|Another {{survivor}} was Katriel Katz, Israeli Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Katz {{had been}} {{expelled from the}} Soviet Union by Andrei Gromyko on 10 June 1967, {{the last day of}} the Six-Day War. During the evacuation from the aircraft, Katz was the only passenger to escape through the forward <b>port</b> <b>door,</b> despite the efforts of Hutchinson and Unwin to stop him using that door. The two flight crew were almost carried out through the door by Katz, who was a large man. Katz was seriously injured jumping from the doorway. He was taken to Hillingdon Hospital, where it was initially feared that he would become the sixth victim of Flight 712. Katz recovered after a few days. He died in 1988 aged 80.|$|E
25|$|The {{charge port}} area now {{comes with a}} light not {{provided}} on earlier models, {{and the ability to}} open the <b>port</b> <b>door</b> from inside the car or by using the key fob. The onboard charger in all 2013 Leafs has also been reduced in size and relocated to a new position under the hood, which increases cargo volume. The new base trim level is called the Leaf S model, and {{is the result of a}} strategy for affordability. The S trim replaces the LED headlights with less expensive projector beams, and uses 16-inch steel wheels with plastic covers rather than alloy wheels. The base trim does not include the navigation system and the remote connectivity that allows drivers to turn on the climate control and monitor battery charging remotely using a smartphone. LED headlamps, fog lights, 17-inch alloy wheels and leather seating, are reserved for the higher-end SL trim. Additional premium upgrades to the SL trim include a Bose seven-speaker audio system and around view monitor, which puts cameras in front, in back and on the side mirrors for parking assistance.|$|E

500|$|The {{cabin crew}} started the evacuation, {{even before the}} plane {{had come to a}} halt, via both forward galley doors, both rear doors and the {{starboard}} overwing exits. Eighteen passengers escaped via the overwing exits before the fire grew too intense to use that route. The forward port galley door escape slide caught fire before it could be used, but one person jumped from there. 84 people escaped via the starboard galley door. Three of the crew escaped by the emergency cockpit rope. The rear starboard door escape slide had twisted on deployment, so Steward Taylor climbed down to straighten it, leaving stewardess Jane Harrison at the door assisting the passengers. Six passengers escaped via this route before the slide was punctured and deflated. Harrison encouraged the passengers to jump, and pushed out those too frightened to do so. 11 people escaped via this route, and five more escaped via the rear <b>port</b> <b>door</b> before the slide was destroyed. Harrison was last seen alive preparing to jump herself, but then she turned back and disappeared into the burning fuselage in an attempt to save the remaining four female passengers, including a disabled woman and eight-year-old girl. It was these actions which led to the award of the George Cross posthumously [...] to Harrison in recognition of her selfless gallantry. 35 people were injured, and five killed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{landed at}} a site located [...] {{from the end of}} the runway and [...] from the sea. Once the aircraft had come to a halt, the pilots turned off the fuel supply and activated the engine fire extinguishers. They were not able to order evacuation by intercom, as it was not functioning. The forward starboard door could not be opened due to a jam, while the cockpit and forward <b>port</b> <b>door</b> were both blocked. The pilots evacuated through the left cockpit window, while all surviving passengers evacuated through the aft <b>port</b> <b>door.</b> The pilots attempted to open the jammed front <b>port</b> <b>door,</b> but failed. The commander then re-entered the cockpit to again attempt to open the cockpit door, but failed. By then the heat hindered further attempts. Both pilots were seriously injured in the process. The injured were flown to hospital by air ambulance. Several of the passengers sitting close to the front of the aircraft decided to evacuate towards the aft, as that part of the aircraft was more intact.|$|E

50|$|An {{expanded}} {{version of}} the game, branded Door Door mkII, was released {{three years after the}} original in February 1985. The game was ported to MSX computers, NEC's PC-6001, PC-6001mkII, PC-6601, PC-8801, PC-8801mkII, and PC-8801mkIISR models, Sharp's MZ-2000, and Fujitsu's FM-7. It features 100 levels and the option to start the game from the new set of levels (beginning with level 51). Encouraged by the rapidly increasing popularity of video game consoles in Japan, Enix also <b>ported</b> <b>Door</b> Door to Nintendo's Famicom. In March 2004, Chunsoft celebrated their 20th anniversary by releasing a version of Door Door for Japanese mobile phone networks. A faithful reproduction of the Famicom version, the application is available for the NTT DoCoMo FOMA 505i and 900i series phones, and can be downloaded from i-chunsoft for Â¥300 per month.

5000|$|The {{cells in}} St. Louis County Jail {{do not have}} bars, instead the floor plan is {{laid out in a}} {{dormitory}} fashion. At the front of the housing unit, referred to as a [...] "pod", there is a sally <b>port</b> <b>door,</b> with an inner and outer door. The outer door is controlled by a permanent staff member who mans a desk in the convergence area of the floor. The inner sally port is controlled by the housing unit officer. Once through the doors, the room opens up into a double tiered great-room. Near the sally port is the table area where inmates may use their rec time to play games. It also serves as their dining location. Beyond that is a TV area lined with plastic recliners. The inmates are provided with two flat-screen TV's to watch any number of channels provided to them. Near the rear of the pod is the officer's podium; a cinder block half-wall with a desk embedded into it. The officer must never be far from the podium as it contains their computer and the control panel which unlocks the doors in the pod.|$|E

50|$|In April 1453, Mehmed laid siege to Constantinople. Although the citys defenders, led by Giovanni Giustiniani under Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologoss (1448-53) authority, put up {{a heroic}} defense, {{without the benefit of}} outside aid their efforts were doomed. The {{formerly}} impregnable land walls were breached after two months of constant pounding by Mehmeds heavy artillery. In the predawn hours of 29 May 1453, Mehmed ordered an all-out assault on the battered ramparts. After a brief but vicious melee at the walls in which Giustiniani was severely injured coupled with Ottoman troops breaching the walls through a sally <b>port</b> <b>door</b> left open, the Ottoman troops were able to breach the walls and rout the defenders. According to Christian sources, Emperor Constantine died bravely rushing into the oncoming Ottoman troops not to be seen again. However, according to Ottoman sources such as Tursun Beg he threw off his mantle and attempted to flee before being cut down by an injured Ottoman soldier. The Ottoman Army broke through and swept over the city. Constantinople, for a millennium considered by many Europeans the divinely ordained capital of the Christian Roman Empire, fell to Mehmed and was transformed into what many Muslims considered the divinely ordained capital of the Islamic Ottoman Empire. The fabled citys imperial legacy lived on. After the conquest, the sultan had his grand vizier ÃandarlÄ± Halil Pasha killed. His following four granviziers were of devshirme origin. During the growth of the Empire Turks seldom were appointed to the high positions.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Measurements {{were made}} of the sound {{pressure}} levels on a military ship HMS Grimsby during firing of a Heavy Machine Gun (HMG) mounted on the starboard bridge wing. The measurement positions comprised three locations on the shipâs bridge (the wheelhouse) and one location on the starboard bridge wing. Equipment and Procedure: The three locations on the bridge were the starboard door, centre and <b>port</b> <b>door.</b> A total of 255 burst firings were measured during the survey comprising 850 rounds with each burst encompassing from 1 to 10 rounds. Analysis: The data have been assessed and interpreted {{in accordance with the}} Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005. Results: The highest peak sound pressure levels measured on the bridge wing and on the bridge were 160. 7 dB(C) (2170 [*]Pa) and 122. 7 dB(C) (27. 3 [*]Pa), respectively. The highest sound exposure levels measured on the bridge wing and on the bridge corresponding to one round being fired were 127. 8 dB(A) and 88. 9 dB(A), respectively. The shipâs structure provided about 40 [*]dB attenuation in the transmitted noise. Discussion: The operator of the weapon would be required to wear some form of hearing protection. On the basis of the measured peak noise levels, there would be no requirement for bridge crew to wear any hearing protection during firing of a HMG. However, crew exposure to noise on the bridge is likely to exceed the upper exposure action value corresponding to 85 dB(A) after about 11, 750 rounds. Conclusions: Measurements made on the bridge wings are likely to be affected by reflections from the shipâs structure...|$|E
