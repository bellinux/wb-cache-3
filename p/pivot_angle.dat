A control computer can simplify mechanical movements and can keep records of the length and diameter of trees cut. Length is computed by either counting the rotations of the gripping wheels or, more commonly, using the measuring wheel. Diameter is computed from the <b>pivot</b> <b>angle</b> of the gripping wheels or delimbing knives when hugging the tree. Length measurement also can be used for automated cutting of the tree into predefined lengths. Computer software can predict the volume of each stem based on analysing stems harvested previously. This information when used in conjunction with price lists for each specific log specification enables the optimisation of log recovery from the stem.|$|E

For example, after the input speed of the fixed displacement pump and the <b>pivot</b> <b>angle</b> of the variable motor are changed, the same variation in <b>pivot</b> <b>angle</b> of the motor causes different variation in speed of the motor. Therefore, multiplication nonlinear law works here. As for this problem, small signal linearization method is adopted to analyze a fixed displacementvariable motor system transfer function and obtain the relationship among natural frequency, damping ratio and the <b>pivot</b> <b>angle</b> of the motor. Further identify the experimental data, experimental value for natural frequency and damping ratio {{of the system is}} obtained. Also, fitting method is adopted to obtain the relationship among natural frequency, damping ratio and <b>pivot</b> <b>angle</b> of the motor, which lays the foundation for the application of fixed displacement pump-variable motor speed control system...|$|E
40|$|Furling {{automatic}} {{system is a}} system that uses a combination of gravity and wind speed. This system can avoid the wind turbine damage from high wind speeds. Furling {{automatic system}} work based on wind speed, if wind speed exceeds the maximum limit the automatic furling system will work with moving the surface of the blade against the wind direction, so the result the blade surface area (A) which deal with the direction the wind is making wind turbine moves vertical or horizontal. This system uses two methods, vertical system method is by using the hinge spring mounted in the turbine body that moves up and down, when the wind speed exceeds the maximum limit then the system will slow movement of the blade, and method of the horizontal system where using the simple hinge mounted at the tail pivot (shaft tail), when wind speed exceeds the maximum limit the turbine will move horizontally, so that will slow the blade rotation. Furling automatic system has not been widely used in wind turbine, so that its development has not been so widespread, especially in Indonesia which is currently developing wind turbine technology for alternative energy. Benefits of use this system can prevent wind turbine damage caused by excessive wind speeds. Technology used in this system is very efficient because it does not require a complicated design. This system also functions as a controller of the blade rotation rate caused wind speed and used in small-scale wind turbines horizontal axis type. One of the standard horizontal wind turbine blade from the USA is the NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, USA) consists of 25 airfoil design. Selection of the blade type based on blade length and power generators that will be used. This design has been developed since 1984. This research will use this type of blade from NREL Thick-Airfoil Family for Small blade type S 822 and S 823. Based on the calculation of automatic furling system, the obtained results blade used to modeling is the NREL Thick-Airfoil Family for Small blade type S 822 and S 823 with tail length 104. 5 cm and weight 8. 50 kgm/s 2.

40|$|Riffle–pool {{sequences}} {{are maintained}} through the preferential entrainment of sediment grains from pools rather than riffles. This preferential entrainment has {{been attributed to}} a reversal in the magnitude of velocity and shear stress under high flows; however the Differential Sediment Entrainment Hypothesis (DSEH) postulates that differential entrainment can instead result from spatial sedimentological contrasts. Here we use a novel suite of in situ grain-scale field measurements from a riffle–pool sequence to parameterize a physically-based model of grain entrainment. Field measurements include <b>pivoting</b> <b>angles,</b> lift forces and high resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) acquired using terrestrial laser scanning, from which particle exposure, protrusion and surface roughness were derived. The entrainment model results show that grains in pools have a lower critical entrainment shear stress than grains in either pool exits or riffles. This is because pool grains have looser packing, hence greater exposure and lower <b>pivoting</b> <b>angles.</b> Conversely, riffle and pool exit grains have denser packing, lower exposure and higher <b>pivoting</b> <b>angles.</b> A cohesive matrix further stabilizes pool exit grains. The resulting predictions of critical entrainment shear stress for grains in different subunits are compared with spatial patterns of bed shear stress derived from a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the reach. The CFD model predicts that, under bankfull conditions, pools experience lower shear stresses than riffles and pool exits. However, the difference in sediment entrainment shear stress is sufficiently large that sediment in pools is still more likely to be entrained than sediment in pool exits or riffles, resulting in differential entrainment under bankfull flows. Significantly, this differential entrainment does not require a reversal in flow velocities or shear stress, suggesting that sedimentological contrasts alone may be sufficient for the maintenance of riffle–pool sequences. This finding has implications for the prediction of sediment transport and the morphological evolution of gravel-bed rivers...|$|R
40|$|Noncontact ACL {{injuries}} occur {{most commonly}} in pivoting sports and {{are much more}} frequent in females than in males. However, information on sex differences in proprioceptive acuity under weight-bearing and leg neuromuscular control in pivoting is scarce. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate sex differences in pivoting neuromuscular control during strenuous stepping tasks and proprioceptive acuity under weight-bearing. 21 male and 22 female subjects were recruited to evaluate pivoting proprioceptive acuity under weight-bearing, and pivoting neuromuscular control (in terms of leg pivoting instability, stiffness, maximum internal and external <b>pivoting</b> <b>angles,</b> and entropy of time-to-peak EMG in lower limb muscles) during strenuous stepping tasks performed on a novel offaxis elliptical trainer. Compared to males, females had significantly lower proprioceptive acuity under weight-bearing in both internal and external pivoting directions, higher pivoting instability, larger maximum internal <b>pivoting</b> <b>angle,</b> lower leg <b>pivoting</b> stiffness, and higher entropy of time-to-peak EMG in the gastrocnemius muscles during strenuous stepping tasks with internal and external pivoting perturbations. Results of this study may help us better understand factors contributing to ACL injuries in females and males, develop training strategies to improve pivoting neuromuscular control and proprioceptive acuity, and potentially reduce ACL and lower-limb musculoskeletal injuriesclose 0...|$|R

5000|$|The {{semaphore}} arm {{consists of two}} parts: A wooden or metal arm (or [...] "blade") which <b>pivots</b> at different <b>angles,</b> and a spectacle holding coloured lenses which move {{in front of a}} lamp in order to provide indications at night. Usually these were combined into a single frame, though in some types (e.g. [...] "somersault" [...] signals in which the arm pivoted in the centre), the arm was separate from the spectacle.

5000|$|The Chinese [...] "yuloh" [...] (from [...] ) is a large, heavy {{sculling}} oar with {{a socket}} {{on the underside}} of its shaft which fits over a stern-mounted pin, creating a pivot which allows the oar to swivel and rock from side to side. The weight of the oar, often supplemented by a rope lashing, holds the oar in place on the pivot. The weight of the outboard portion of the oar is counterbalanced by a rope running from the underside of the handle to the deck of the boat. The sculler mainly moves the oar by pushing and pulling on this rope, which causes the oar to rock on its <b>pivot,</b> automatically <b>angling</b> the blade to create forward thrust. This system allows multiple rowers to operate one oar, allowing large, heavy boats to be rowed if necessary. The efficiency of this system gave rise to the Chinese saying [...] "a scull equals three oars".|$|R

The variable wing can adopt any sweep angle between 25 degrees and 67 degrees, with a corresponding speed range for each angle; some Tornado ADVs were outfitted with an automatic wing-sweep system to reduce pilot workload. When the wings are swept back, the exposed wing area is lowered and drag is significantly decreased, which is conducive to performing high-speed low-level flight. The weapons pylons <b>pivot</b> with the <b>angle</b> of the variable-sweep wings so that the stores point in the direction of flight and do not hinder any wing positions.|$|R

500|$|An {{example of}} such a design is shown in figure 10a. The {{resonators}} are disc flexural resonators similar to those shown in figure 6, except that these are energised from an edge, leading to vibration in the fundamental flexural mode with a node in the centre, whereas the figure 6 design is energised in the centre leading to vibration in the second flexural mode at resonance. The resonators are mechanically attached to the housing by <b>pivots</b> at right <b>angles</b> to the coupling wires. The pivots are to ensure free turning of the resonator and minimise losses. The resonators are treated as lumped elements; however, the coupling wires are made exactly one half-wavelength (λ/2) long and are equivalent to a λ/2 open circuit stub in the electrical equivalent circuit. For a narrow-band filter, a stub of this sort has the approximate equivalent circuit of a parallel shunt tuned circuit as shown in figure 10b. Consequently, the connecting wires are being used in this design to add additional resonators into the circuit and will have a better response than one with just the lumped resonators and short couplings. [...] For even higher frequencies, microelectromechanical methods can be used as described below.|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{is comprised}} of a pipe crawler having a midsection that provides the stability and flexibility to allow the pipe crawler to negotiate curved and uneven segments of piping while traveling through piping systems. The pipe crawler comprises a front leg assembly, a rear leg assembly, a midsection with a gimbal at each end for connecting the midsection {{to the front and}} rear leg assemblies in a flexible manner, and an air cylinder for changing the distance between the front and rear leg assemblies. The pipe crawler moves in ``inch worm`` fashion with the front and rear leg assemblies alternating between an extended and a retracted position as the air cylinder moves the retracted leg assembly forward. The midsection has a plurality of legs extending radially for holding the midsection within a maximum displacement from the piping axis so that the gimbals are not <b>pivoted</b> to extreme <b>angles</b> where they might lock up or seize. When the midsection is displaced sufficiently, its legs with wheels on each end engage the interior surface of the piping and prevent further displacement. Using two gimbals divides the angle between the planes defined by the front and rear leg assemblies which also helps to prevent excessive gimbal pivoting...|$|R
