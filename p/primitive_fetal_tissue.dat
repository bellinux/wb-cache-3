Is <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> transplantation necessary and beneficial? Are fetal rights violated {{by the use of}} <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> in research? Is there a moral danger that the potential of <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> donation will encourage elective abortions? Should pregnant women be allowed to designate specific fetal transplant recipients? What criteria should be used to select <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> transplants?

40|$|Ethical {{controversy}} over transplantation of human <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> has arisen because {{the source of}} tissue is induced abortions. Opposition to such transplants {{has been based on}} various arguments, including the following: rightful informed consent cannot be obtained for use of <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> from induced abortions, and <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> transplantation might result in {{an increase in the number}} of abortions. These arguments were not accepted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Human <b>Fetal</b> <b>Tissue</b> Transplantation Research Panel. The majority opinion of the panel stated that abortion and <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> use are entirely separate issues, and that tissue use is ethically acceptable because it can be morally insulated from the issue of abortion. In support of this view, panel members and others have replied to the arguments put forward by opponents of <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> use. However, replies to the two arguments mentioned above have been unsatisfactory, and the shortcomings of those replies are identified herein. Examination of the arguments pro and con suggests that <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> use cannot be completely insulated from the issue of abortion. Thus, in seeking an ethical justification for <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> transplantation we must consider reasons other than those put forward by the NIH panel. In this paper it is argued that whatever wrong is involved in using <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> from induced abortions must be balanced against the benefits for patients, and it is on this basis that <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> transplantation can be ethically justified...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To provide {{empirical}} {{data on the}} attitudes of Ontario family physicians and gynecologists toward the use of electively aborted <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> for transplantation (FTT). DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Random samples of 300 physicians from the membership list of the College of Family Physicians of Canada and 300 from the membership list of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada; 248 family physicians and 186 gynecologists responded, for an overall response rate of 72 %. OUTCOME MEASURES: Physicians' attitudes toward incentives to collect <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> at abortion, patient-management issues, consent issues and potential conflicts in the supply and demand of <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue.</b> RESULTS: Of those surveyed 75 % agreed {{that there should be}} no incentives to collect <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> at abortion, 90 % believed that decisions to abort must be separate from decisions to donate <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue,</b> 94 % agreed that an option to donate <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> should be discussed only after a firm decision to abort has been made, and 88 % stated that the demand for <b>fetal</b> <b>tissue</b> should not hinder the availability of new abortion technology such as the abortifacient pill (RU 486).

Stochastic dosimetry is an alternative method to build analytical approximations of exposure at a lower computational cost.
