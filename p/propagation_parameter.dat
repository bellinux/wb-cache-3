5000|$|The term [...] "propagation constant" [...] is {{somewhat}} of a misnomer as it usually varies strongly with ω. It {{is probably the most}} widely used term but there are a large variety of alternative names used by various authors for this quantity. These include transmission parameter, transmission function, <b>propagation</b> <b>parameter,</b> propagation coefficient and transmission constant. If the plural is used, it suggests that α and β are being referenced separately but collectively as in transmission parameters, propagation parameters, etc. In transmission line theory, α and β are counted among the [...] "secondary coefficients", the term secondary being used to contrast to the primary line coefficients. The primary coefficients are the physical properties of the line, namely R,C,L and G, from which the secondary coefficients may be derived using the telegrapher's equation. Note that in the field of transmission lines, the term transmission coefficient has a different meaning despite the similarity of name: it is the companion of the reflection coefficient.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} {{experiments}} with conical refraction of laser beams possessing a high beam <b>propagation</b> <b>parameter</b> M 2. With beam <b>propagation</b> <b>parameter</b> values M 2 = 3 and M 2 = 5, unusual Lloyd's distributions with correspondingly three and five dark rings were observed. In order {{to explain this}} phenomenon, we extend the dual-cone model of the conical refraction that describes it {{as a product of}} interference of two cones that converge and diverge behind the exit facet of the crystal. In the extended model, these converging/diverging cones are represented as the cone-shaped quasi-Gaussian beams possessing the M 2 parameter of an original beam. In this formalism, a beam-waist of these cone-shaped beams is proportional to the M 2 value and defines the area of their interference which is a width of the Lloyd's ring. Therefore, the number of dark rings in the Lloyd distribution is defined by the M 2 value and can be much greater than unity. The results of the numerical simulations within the extended dual-cone model are in excellent agreement with the experiment...|$|E

Lactobacillus amylovorus and Lactobacillus frumenti or Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus pontis and Lactobacillus panis prevailed in sourdoughs propagated at higher temperature, while ambient temperature combined with a short fermentation cycle selected for Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Lactobacillus pontis, and Lactobacillus zymae or Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus pontis and Lactobacillus zymae. The ratio of species in bakeries employing room-temperature propagation displayed a seasonal dependence.

40|$|To define {{thresholds}} {{for detecting}} {{significant change in}} liver viscoelasticity with magnetic resonance (MR) elastography, both for whole-liver measurements and for voxel-wise measurements in relation to spatial resolution. This prospective study {{was approved by the}} institutional review board, and all participants provided written informed consent. Thirty participants (16 volunteers and 14 patients with hepatitis B or C; 18 men; median age, 30. 4 years; age range, 18. 9 - 58. 6 years) underwent imaging twice while in the same position (intraimage reproducibility), after repositioning (within-day reproducibility), and 1 - 4 weeks later (between-weeks reproducibility). MR elastography parameters comprised elasticity, viscosity, attenuation parameter α, and <b>propagation</b> <b>parameter</b> β. Bland-Altman analysis was used to calculate repeatability indexes for each parameter. Analyses were performed in a region-of-interest and a voxel-by-voxel level. Voxel-wise results were calculated in relation to spatial resolution by applying Gaussian filtering to establish the optimal trade-off point between resolution and reproducibility. For elasticity, α, and β, within-day and between-weeks results were significantly lower than intraimage results (P ≤. 018 for all). Within-day and between-weeks results did not differ significantly. Over-time changes of more than 22. 2 % for elasticity, 26. 3 % for viscosity, 26. 8 % for α, and 10. 1 % for β represented thresholds for significant change. The optimal trade-off between spatial resolution and reproducibility was found at a filter size of 8 -mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) for elasticity and <b>propagation</b> <b>parameter</b> β and at 16 -mm FWHM for viscosity and attenuation parameter α. Repositioning causes a significant decrease in the reproducibility of MR elastography. The <b>propagation</b> <b>parameter</b> β is the most reliable parameter, with an over-time threshold for significant change of 10. 1 % and the ability to reproduce viscoelasticity up to a resolution of 8 -mm FWHM.

40|$|Photoacoustic imaging is a {{relatively}} new medical imaging modality. In principle {{it can be used to}} image the optical absorption distribution of an object by measurements of optically induced acoustic signals. Recently we have developed a modified photoacoustic measurement system which can be used to simultaneously image the ultrasound <b>propagation</b> <b>parameters</b> as well. By proper placement of a passive element we obtain isolated measurements of the object's ultrasound <b>propagation</b> <b>parameters,</b> independent of the optical absorption inside the object. This passive element acts as a photoacoustic source and measurements are obtained by allowing the generated ultrasound signal to propagate through the object. Images of the ultrasound <b>propagation</b> <b>parameters,</b> being the attenuation and speed of sound, can then be reconstructed by inversion of a measurement model. This measurement model relates the projections non-linearly to the unknown images, due to ray refraction effects. After estimating the speed of sound and attenuation distribution, the optical absorption distribution is reconstructed. In this reconstruction problem we take into account the previously estimated speed of sound distribution. So far, the reconstruction algorithms have been tested using computer simulations. The method has been compared with existing algorithms and good results have been obtained...|$|R

Assessing all these effects would require inverting the estimated <b>propagation</b> <b>parameters</b> using theoretical slowness fields obtained from wavefield simulations in three-dimensional, heterogeneous media, and including the free-surface effect of topography (e.g., Almendros et al., 2001 a).

40|$|Many {{applications}} of high-power laser diodes demand tight focusing. This {{is often not}} possible due to the multimode nature of semiconductor laser radiation possessing beam <b>propagation</b> <b>parameter</b> M 2 values in double-digits. We propose a method of ‘interference ’ superfocusing of high-M 2 diode laser beams with a technique developed for the generation of Bessel beams based on the employment of an axicon fabricated {{on the tip of}} a 100 μm diameter optical fiber with high-precision direct laser writing. Using axicons with apex angle 1400 and rounded tip area as small as ~ 10 μm diameter, we demonstrate 2 - 4 μm diameter focused laser ‘needle ’ beams with approximately 20 μm propagation length generated from multimode diode laser with beam <b>propagation</b> <b>parameter</b> M 2 = 18 and emission wavelength of 960 nm. This is a few-fold reduction compared to the minimal focal spot size of ~ 11 μm that could be achieved if focused by an ‘ideal ’ lens of unity numerical aperture.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the extent to}} which the uncertainties associated with the propagation of Galactic cosmic rays impact upon estimates for the gamma-ray flux from the mid-latitude region. We consider contributions from both standard astrophysical background (SAB) processes as well as resolved point sources. We have found that the uncertainties in the total gamma-ray flux from the mid-latitude region relating to <b>propagation</b> <b>parameter</b> values consistent with local B/C and Be 10 /Be 9 data dominate by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude. These uncertainties are reduced to less than an order of magnitude when the normalisations of the SAB spectral components are fitted to the corresponding Fermi LAT data. We have found that for many <b>propagation</b> <b>parameter</b> configurations (PPCs) our fits improve when an extragalactic background (EGB) component is simultaneously fitted to the data. We also {{investigate the}} improvement in our fits when a flux contribution from neutralino dark matter (DM), described by the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, was simultaneously fitted to the data. We consider three representative cases of neutralino DM for both Burkert and Einasto DM density profiles, in each case simultaneously fitting a boost factor of the DM contribution together with the SAB and EGB components. We have found that for several PPCs there are significant improvements in our fits, yielding both substantial EGB and DM components, where for a few of these PPCs the best-fit EGB component is consistent with recent estimates by the Fermi Collaboration.

40|$|We {{calculate}} the antiproton flux due to relic neutralino annihilations, in a two-dimensional diffusion model compatible with stable and radioactive cosmic ray nuclei. We {{find that the}} uncertainty in the primary flux induced by the <b>propagation</b> <b>parameters</b> alone is about two orders of magnitude at low energies, and it is mainly determined {{by the lack of}} knowledge on the thickness of the diffusive halo. On the contrary, different dark matter density profiles do not significantly alter the flux: a NFW distribution produces fluxes which are at most 20 % higher than an isothermal sphere. The most conservative choice for <b>propagation</b> <b>parameters</b> and dark matter distribution normalization, together with current data on cosmic antiprotons, cannot lead to any definitive constraint on the supersymmetric parameter space, neither in a low-energy effective MSSM, or in a minimal SUGRA scheme. However, if the best choice for <b>propagation</b> <b>parameters</b> - corresponding to a diffusive halo of L= 4 kpc - is adopted, some supersymmetric configurations with the neutralino mass of about 100 GeV should be considered as excluded. An enhancement flux factor - due for instance to a clumpy dark halo or to a higher local dark matter density - would imply a more severe cut on the supersymmetric parameters.
