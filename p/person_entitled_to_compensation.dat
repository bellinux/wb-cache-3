40|$|The article {{defends the}} concept of luck egalitarianism. Luck egalitarianism states that social and {{economic}} inequality is justifiable only if the person concerned is responsible for their position. If birth, circumstance or disability results in inequality, then the <b>person</b> is <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>compensation.</b> Metaphysical arguments are often used to dispute luck egalitarianism. Arguments have been made that given metaphysical libertarianism, i. e. people have free will, those who are inherently lazy or reckless are just as deserving of compensation as the disabled. The article argues that luck egalitarianism can respond to metaphysical concerns by its superior accounting {{of the role of}} responsibility, which can be judged by an educated guess...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my {{study is to}} {{investigate}} whether luck egalitarianism can be saved from its inability {{to draw a line}} between risks which can reasonably be expected to be avoided, and risk which can not. Such a demarcation is of particular importance for this influential theory of distributive justice, since it serves to judge whether a <b>person</b> is <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>compensation</b> for a bad outcome of a taken risk, or not. Testing the intuitiveness and coherence of various contending principles for how to separate avoidable risks from unavoidable ones, I conclude that luck egalitarianism seems unable to draw a clear line between the two kinds of risks. Instead the theory appears to be dependent on conceptions of a 'normal life', making it remarkably vague. Furthermore, I argue that luck egalitarianism seems unable to manage without taking sufficientarian and utilitarian concerns into account, for the purpose of deciding which risks are avoidable, and which are not...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{compensation}} for immaterial damages in the Czech Republic and Germany with focus on personal injuries and a specific question of wrongful birth and wrongful life actions. Its {{aim is to}} describe the differences between both legislations. In the first part my work is concerned with a theoretical analysis of the conditions of damage liability in the tort law in both countries. The second chapter follows up with the definition of material and immaterial damages and the way and extent of their compensation. The third one is concentrated directly on personal injuries, it introduces the term {{and the range of}} <b>persons</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> a <b>compensation</b> and it analyses the way and extent of the compensation for personal injuries (above all the damages for pain and suffering) in the Czech Republic and Germany, with specific emphasis on the Methodology of the Czech Supreme Court on the compensation for immaterial damages in case of personal injuries. The fourth chapter is focused on an ethical and legally complicated question of wrongful birth and wrongful life actions...|$|R
40|$|The {{adequate}} {{protection of}} {{passengers on board}} ships is a key concern of the European transport policy. It {{is also one of}} the main concerns of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Strengthening the rights of sea passengers became one of the top priorities of the worldwide shipping community following the occurrence of a number of tragic shipping accidents in past decades. There are two “legislative weapons ” which have to be used in order to achieve this goal. The first is preventative – the modification of passenger ship safety rules. The other is palliative – the improvement of rules regulating the compensation of passengers (and other <b>persons</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> such <b>compensation)</b> for damage suffered as a consequence of an accident that occurs onboard a ship. This paper presents an overview of rules covering the matter of compensation of maritime passengers in the case of accidents. Important international agreements and other legal instruments that are currently in force shall be analysed as well as new instruments which are likely to come into force in the near future. Provisions of the Croatian Maritime Code (CMC) shall be compared to the solutions which relevant international agreements provide. Key words: carriage of passengers by sea, liability of carrier, marine insurance...|$|R
40|$|On January 1, 1995, Saskatchewan {{adopted a}} radical, no-fault system for motor vehicle {{accident}} insurance. Virtually no room was left for injured victims to sue for damages, whether for pain and suffering or for economic compensation. In fact, the no-fault system removed benefits for pain and suffering altogether. Apart from the concern that arose at the denial of justice in relation to economic matters and the blanket denial of pain, there was concern over the arrangements for medical care. Under the new Automobile Accident Insurance Act, injured <b>persons</b> were <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>compensation</b> and payment for treatment, as managed by their own doctors, chiropractors or physiotherapists {{for the first six}} weeks subsequent to an injury. Thereafter, they were required to be seen by insurance company-appointed doctors, chiropractors or physiotherapists if they wished the income replacement benefits to continue, treatment to be provided or both. They also were obliged to accept the recommendations of the insurance company doctors for the next 12 weeks, under what was called 'secondary rehabilitation'. If they claimed not to be well {{at the end of that}} period, further rehabilitation, described as 'tertiary rehabilitation' would be ordered. Two specific 'in-patient' centres were established for tertiary rehabilitation in different parts of the province (Regina and Saskatoon), and victims thought to be in need of tertiary rehabilitation had to travel if they did not live in either Regina (the provincial capital) or Saskatoon. The administration and treatment of individuals under these systems were so unacceptable to many individuals that a widespread resistance movement was generated and was established as the Coalition Against No-Fault Insurance on August 28, 1998, opening with simultaneous protests in Regina, Saskatoon, Prince Albert North Battleford and Estevan, each one organized by a local victim of the no-fault insurance scheme...|$|R

40|$|D. Litt. et. Phil. Head {{injury is}} the major {{cause of death for}} {{individuals}} under 35 years old in the United States of America, and a similar picture exists in South Africa. A major cause of traumatic brain injury is motor vehicle accidents. In addition, the advances in modem medical technology increase the chances for survival, for example, sophisticated medical diagnostic techniques such as computerised tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Advances in emergency trauma and neurosurgical procedures have also increased the number of survivors following a head injury. The symptoms resulting from head injury include disturbed physical, cognitive, psychological and behavioural functioning. Long-term management of these symptoms is usually required. A body of evidence exists that demonstrates the value of rehabilitation {{during the first year of}} recovery from traumatic brain injury. Head injury cases often result in litigation in that the injured <b>person</b> may be <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>compensation</b> for the injuries sustained. Considerable forensic debate exists around the issue of whether the victim's symptoms are attributable to organic brain damage, or whether they reflect a pre-existing functional psychological state of psychiatric illness, or personality disorder. Further still, the individual may be 'malingering' or faking postconcussion symptoms of headache, dizziness, fatigue, memory deficit, impaired concentration, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, concern about bodily functions, and hypersensitivity to light and noise. Alternatively, a common diagnosis is traumatic neurosis with a psychogenic basis, and in the context of litigation is referred to as "compensation neurosis". Specifically, the issue of contention revolves around concussion, and mild or minor head injuries. This study proposed that both neuropathophysiological and psychosocial symptoms occur in the event of a traumatic brain injury. This view supports the traditional model that pain or the sequelae of head injury are not affected by compensation. Therefore, the objective of the study was that follow-up assessment after compensation pay-outs should produce similar results to the assessment results obtained during the litigation process. The hypotheses of the study were essentially confirmed. The neuropsychological error scores produced in the assessments during litigation, and two-to-four years after the completion of litigation were similar. However, similar to other studies, variations were evident. Four exceptions were demonstrated in that significant improvement was evident with regard to shotterm verbal memory delayed recall for paragraphs, and for immediate recall (without and after interference) in verbal memory for a word list. These improvements therefore pertain to verbal memory. The fourth improvement occurred with respect to manual dexterity and visual-motor work speed, although the improvement may be peripheral or primary (neurological). Further findings included that no gender differences were evident in the neuropsychological posttest scores. It was confirmed that individuals with a good Glasgow Outcome Scale rating showed less posttraumatic amnesia, a shorter time since injury, less additional injuries, and a lower compensation sum. It was also supported that individuals with a good Glasgow Outcome Scale rating showed less impairment on neuropsychological indices. However, an exception was that individuals with a moderate Glasgow Outcome Scale rating showed improvement on the neuropsychological index measuring immediate concentration, visual scanning, and visual-motor work speed. The qualitative data or psychosocial measures of severity and outcome produced a similar picture that the majority of subjects maintained their pretest status although some exceptions were evident. Within the medico-legal domain it was shown that, in general, concordance of severity was high amongst the medical experts for the plaintiffs and the defendents. However, their prognoses were indicated to be less accurate, and whilst their consistency in documenting diagnoses in the reports of the subjects was adequate, they were found to be inconsistent in documenting severity ratings and prognoses. It was suggested that improvements may be attributed to neurophysiological differences, non-participation in a rehabilitation programme, the interference and delay of rehabilitation, increased psychological reactions associated with litigation, and mechanisms of secondary gain which may by attributed to the other players, such as the family, the attorneys, the medical experts, among others, and not only to the individual or victim...|$|R
