The {{purpose of}} the {{inspection}} was to observe the fluid operations segment of your Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) <b>pre-operational</b> <b>testing</b> program. The canister loading activities observed included canister pressure testing, draining, moisture removal and helium backfilling. The canister unloading activities observed included canister shell cooling with the Supplemental Cooling System, canister shell cooling with annulus flushing, canister gas cooling, canister gas sampling and canister reflooding. The enclosed inspection report documents {{the results of that}} inspection, which were discussed with members of your staff during the exit meeting on September 15, 2006.

40|$|An {{undetermined}} {{amount of}} debris {{remains in the}} K-Basins which must be removed.

This test plan gives s broad scope of the requirements that will be used for testing equipment for K-Basin debris removal. The equipment tested will be used in a radioactive environment. The equipment tested will be used to retrieve, cut, clean, and package debris from both K West and K East Basins. Testing is typically divided into six primary categories: development testing, acceptance <b>testing,</b> qualification <b>testing,</b> <b>pre-operational</b> <b>testing,</b> operational testing, and production/process testing...|$|R
40|$|This PhD {{thesis is}} on <b>Pre-operational</b> <b>Tests</b> and Design Basis Accidents Analyses for a {{generation}} III+ Nuclear Power Plant. The very first milestone of the present work has been {{the development of a}} fully detailed Relap 5 model of the selected Nuclear Power Plant design, which can be used to simulate a variety of steady state and transient conditions. The developed Relap 5 model has been extensively used in this work, which can be thought as divided in two main parts. In the first part, <b>pre-operational</b> <b>tests</b> procedures have been investigated and pre-tests calculations have been performed for three selected <b>pre-operational</b> <b>tests</b> which need to be successfully executed as one of the steps for the licensing of the selected generation III+ Nuclear Power Plant. In {{the second part of the}} work, a combination among passive systems and an active one has been analyzed in order to evaluate the impact on transients progression (two Design Basis Accidents have been considered). Furthermore failure of the active feature has been taken into account to investigate whether a safety issue is raised upon active system failure once it has been put into operation, it has interacted with the passive features and has modified the plant conditions. This second part is towards a full application and exploitation of the defense in depth principle. Pre-tests calculations give good results, i. e. the goals of the tests are achieved. Design Basis Accidents simulations results demonstrate that a combination among passive features and the selected active one provides a better response in comparison to an accident management based exclusively on passive systems, and that no safety issue is raised upon failure of the active feature. Even if a particular generation III+ Nuclear Power Plant has been considered, the backbone of this work is absolutely general and can be extended to other generation III+ and generation IV Nuclear Power Plants...|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, Packet Switch Stream (PSS) was an X.25-based packet-switched network, {{provided}} by the British Post Office Telecommunications and then British Telecommunications starting in 1980. After a period of <b>pre-operational</b> <b>testing</b> with customers (mainly UK universities and computer manufacturers at this early phase) the service was launched as a commercial service on 20 August 1981. The experimental predecessor network (EPSS) formally closed down on 31 July 1981 after all the existing connections had been moved to PSS.|$|R

50|$|During further <b>pre-operational</b> <b>testing,</b> severe {{vibration}} of {{the fuel}} channel gags was detected. The fuel channel gags are valves which are gradually closed to restrict the flow of gas through a fuel channel {{in order to maintain}} the channel gas outlet temperature as the nuclear fuel is used up. Modifications to produce a fluidically generated bias force to stop the gags vibrating took time to design, test and implement, delaying the planned start up date. The station began generating electricity on 5 February 1976.|$|R

40|$|Considerable {{effort is}} put into the safety risk {{assessment}} of any flight <b>test</b> <b>programme</b> - and rightly so, since failures to apply best practice in this area may cause significant expense, and in extremis loss of life. However, {{it must also be}} remembered that the flight <b>test</b> <b>programme</b> itself is an essential component {{in the development of the}} aircraft or system, and that even if safety is never compromised, the failure of a <b>test</b> <b>programme</b> to deliver the required results on time and budget can cause failure of the entire aircraft programme. This paper considers the areas in which planning and conduct of a flight <b>test</b> <b>programme</b> should be protected. In particular it considers the conduct of flight test personnel in ways which go beyond only safety training, the important of documenting all flight test planning and conduct and the continuous justification of flight test conclusions, planning project manning to ensure that the loss (for whatever reason) of key personnel or equipment does not cause complete failure of the flight <b>test</b> <b>programme,</b> how to recover from significant programme disruptions, and most importantly whilst protecting or recovering the flight <b>test</b> <b>programme</b> â€“ how to ensure that safety is not compromised in the process...|$|R
2500|$|The {{required}} power line is configured in de-icing mode {{after being separated}} from their AC circuit. Then, a line de-icing circuit is created {{by a set of}} [...] disconnect switches controlled by the DCU which [...] sends all of the commands to the de-icing converter. The DC current is slowly raised to reach the desired level of current. The de-icing disconnect switches are opened, and the DCU then releases the power line back to the AC network. The lines to be de-iced must stay in normal operation during the entire period of DCU development and start-up. The final installation of the SVC/ de-icer requires a de-icing line equipment <b>pre-operational</b> <b>testing</b> before being installed.The lines being de-iced must stay in normal operation during the start-up as well as throughout the whole period of DCU development. This system is rarely used, only for critical conditions as the operators would be under heavy stress and the man-machine interface (MMI) must be on guided mode. For the five lines being de-iced, there are 13 line topologies that have between 40 and 90 actions per line to be performed during the de-icing process. Out of the five lines, four have three de-icing circuit topologies and the other one only has one. The DCU must offer the possibility to manually confirm the equipmentâ€™s state to the operator in order to continue the process as there is always a chance of communication failure. Flexible stimulation sequences used for control logic and MMI validation, <b>pre-operational</b> <b>testing</b> and operator training are required for line equipment and SVC. For 735 kV lines, de-icing takes place in three steps while 315 kV double circuit lines only need one. A DCU supervises and coordinates all the actions required for de-icing each line in order to provide network security and ensure the de-icing sequences are reliable.|$|R
