The {{synchronously}} reduced {{damping coefficient}} {{in the current}} analysis was developed in equations (35) —(51) with v equal to the shaft rotational speed co, and is nondimen-sionalized according to equation (34). Figure 5 shows the com-parison of the nondimensional synchronously reduced damp-ing coefficient C{t versus (1 - hp) from Lund's analysis with the current approach. The agreement is good, further confirming Lund's trend showing decreased damping with decreased pad stiffness. Similar agreement was observed in the synchronously reduced stiffness coefficient and the load bear-ing capacity. Summary and Conclusions A method of incorporating pad flexibility effects, without the usual beam assumptions, into isothermal tilting pad bear-ing analysis has been developed. The method uses two-dimensional finite elements to determine pad deformations due to fluid film pressures. The <b>pad</b> <b>assembly</b> approach is ex-tended to include single pad deformations, thereby eliminating iterations on the individiual pad angles in the assembled bear-ing analysis. The pad deformations are represented by a single degree of freedom, {{the change in the}} pad radius of curvature, thus the current method is an approximate approach. A method of calculating frequency reduced coefficients is presented. Synchronously reduced coefficients are in agree-ment with previous curved beam approximate methods as well as more rigorous iterative approach.

40|$|Rail seat {{deterioration}} (RSD) {{is considered}} the most critical problem with concrete-tie performance on North American freight railroads. RSD is {{the deterioration of the}} concrete underneath the rail that results in problems such as wide gauge, insufficient rail cant, and loss of fastening toe load. Currently, the problem is not sufficiently understood to enable development of effective solutions. The primary causes of RSD appear to be high stresses at the rail seat, a loosened fastening system, the presence of moisture, and the presence of abrasive fines. RSD is considered to have up to six potential mechanisms, and this research investigates three of them: hydraulic pressure cracking, hydro-abrasive erosion, and cavitation erosion. A laboratory test apparatus and procedure were devised to measure the surface water pressure in a laboratory rail seat using tie pads of differing material composition and surface geometry. To evaluate hydraulic pressure cracking, a model of the effective stress in a concrete-tie rail seat was developed to estimate the water pressures on the rail seat surface and whether they could lead to damaging pore pressures in the concrete. Comparing the effective stress model and the measured surface water pressures, hydraulic pressure cracking appears to be a feasible mechanism for RSD given the correct combination of high rail seat loads, sufficient moisture, and a tie pad surface that develops high pressure. The measured surface water pressures were used to estimate the potential water velocity. By comparing these estimates with critical velocities for concrete erosion, it appears feasible that hydro-abrasive erosion contributes to RSD. The uplift action of the rail was simulated in the test apparatus, and the resulting suction was at or near the vapor pressure of water for most of the tie pads considered, suggesting that cavitation occurs in a concrete-tie rail seat. However, considering the size of the cavitation bubbles that could fit underneath the tie pad, and the observation that no high collapse pressures were measured, cavitation erosion is not a feasible mechanism for RSD. Mitigation options for preventing hydraulic pressure cracking are using a tie pad or <b>pad</b> <b>assembly</b> that does not seal water, reducing the occurrence of high impact loads, and using high-strength, air-entrained, low-permeability concrete. Care should be exercised when using pads that do not seal water, as this could contribute to hydro-abrasive erosion or abrasion...|$|E
50|$|The {{small size}} of the exposed contacts, and the large area of exposed thermal pad {{makes it easy for}} small parts, such as 3x3 mm DFN packages, to float on the pool of molten solder under the thermal <b>pad</b> during <b>assembly.</b> This causes the parts to make no contact to the printed circuit board pads in some instances. Due to the {{excellent}} thermal characteristics of this mounting package, {{it is very hard to}} rework the device, as hot air reflow typically does not offer enough heat to the thermal pad without damage to surrounding board material or parts. Oxidation of the exposed chip contact pads after being exposed to a reflow oven during initial assembly makes solder wetting to them during rework quite difficult. Additionally there is no clearance for a soldering pencil to reflow pads under the chip if touch up is desired. Sometimes contact can be made up the sides of the DFN package contact pads, but this does not work well in practice.|$|R

This goal is addressed by the use of PERC (passivated emitter and rear cell) and MWT-PERC (metal wrap through PERC) structures. Within the frame of the project, several technologies have been investigated in detail and optimised carefully. The various technologies are modular, which allows for an application both in PERC and MWT-PERC structures. We propose the use of thermal oxidation for simultaneous high quality front and rear surface passivation. On high-quality float-zone silicon, which we use for determining the efficiency potential of these structures, the best PERC solar cells achieve a conversion efficiency of 20. 0 %; reduced shading in MWTPERC type devices increases this value to 20. 3 %. In both cases, screen printing forms the front and rear contacts.

Four research tasks are defined, one task each to address each challenge, and a fourth task focused on a demonstration test vehicle. The optimized optical interconnection is able to achieve < 2 dB of coupling loss at fiber-like alignment tolerance. It includes a parallel-processed 45 ° turning mirror using moving mask lithography.

40|$|Replication of {{the human}} genome every time a cell divides is a highly coordinated process that ensures {{accurate}} and efficient inheritance of the genetic information. The molecular mechanism that guarantees that many origins of replication fire only once per cell-cycle has been the area of intense research. The origin recognition complex (ORC) marks the position of replication origins in the genome and serves as the landing <b>pad</b> for the <b>assembly</b> of a multiprotein, pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) at the origins, con-sisting of ORC, cell division cycle 6 (Cdc 6), Cdc 10 -dependent transcript (Cdt 1) and mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins. The MCM proteins serve as key participants in the mechanism that limits eukaryotic DNA replication to once-per-cell-cycle and its binding to the chromatin marks the final step of pre-RC formation, a process referred to as ‘replication licensing’. We present data demonstrating how the MCM proteins associate with the chromatin during the G 1 phase, probably defining pre-RCs and then anticipate replication fork movement in a precisely coordinated manner during the S phase of the cell cycle. The process of DNA replication must also be carefully coordinated with other cell-cycle pro-cesses including mitosis and cytokinesis. Some of the proteins that control initiation of DNA replication are likely to interact with the pathways that control these important cell-cycle transitions. Herein, we discuss the participation of human ORC proteins in other vital functions, in addition to their bona fide roles in replication.
