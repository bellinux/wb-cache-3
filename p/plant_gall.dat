2500|$|Tannins {{are found}} in the skin, stems, and seeds of wine grapes but can also be {{introduced}} to the wine through the use of oak barrels and chips or with the addition of tannin powder. The natural tannins found in grapes are known as proanthocyanidins due to their ability to release red anthocyanin pigments when they are heated in an acidic solution. Grape extracts are mainly rich in monomers and small oligomers (mean degree of polymerization <8). Grape seed extracts contain three monomers (catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin gallate) and procyanidin oligomers. Grape skin extracts contain four monomers (catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin and epigallocatechin), as well as procyanidins and prodelphinidins oligomers. The tannins are formed by enzymes during metabolic processes of the grapevine. The amount of tannins found naturally in grapes varies depending on the variety with Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Syrah and Tannat being 4 of the most tannic grape varieties. The reaction of tannins and anthocyanins with the phenolic compound catechins creates another class of tannins known as pigmented tannins which influence the color of red wine. Commercial preparations of tannins, known as enological tannins, made from oak wood, grape seed and skin, <b>plant</b> <b>gall,</b> chestnut, quebracho, gambier and myrobalan fruits, can be added at different stages of the wine production to improve color durability. The tannins derived from oak influence are known as [...] "hydrolysable tannins" [...] being created from the ellagic and gallic acid found in the wood.|$|E
50|$|Galls or cecidia are {{a kind of}} {{swelling}} {{growth on}} the external tissues of plants or animals. <b>Plant</b> <b>galls</b> are abnormal outgrowths of plant tissues, similar to benign tumors or warts in animals.

40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>galls</b> {{are widely}} distributed, and their {{extracts}} {{are used in}} traditional medicine worldwide. Traditional remedies containing extracts of <b>plant</b> <b>galls</b> in China, India and some African countries have effective {{in the treatment of}} various pathologies. To open a new promising procedure for screening bioactive compounds from <b>plant</b> <b>galls,</b> standardized <b>plant</b> materials were generated in vitro and used for phytochemical and biological investigations. Methanol aqueous chloroform and hexane extracts of Nicotiana tabacum leafy galls induced by Rhodococcus fascians were used to evaluate phenolic and flavonoid contents, and to investigate antioxidant activity by 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidant/power assays and anti-inflammatory activity by the lipoxygenase inhibition assay. Infection by R. fascians modifies significantly the phytochemical profile of N. tabacum as well as its biological properties. The total polyphenolic content was increased (120 - 307 %), and that of flavonoids was reduced (20 - 42. 5 %). Consequently, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of non-infected tobacco extracts are significantly modified compared to plants treated with leafy gall extracts. This shows that infection by R. fascians favoured the production of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds in N. tabacum.

5000|$|Tannins {{are found}} in the skin, stems, and seeds of wine grapes but can also be {{introduced}} to the wine through the use of oak barrels and chips or with the addition of tannin powder. The natural tannins found in grapes are known as proanthocyanidins due to their ability to release red anthocyanin pigments when they are heated in an acidic solution. Grape extracts are mainly rich in monomers and small oligomers (mean degree of polymerization <8). Grape seed extracts contain three monomers (catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin gallate) and procyanidin oligomers. Grape skin extracts contain four monomers (catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin and epigallocatechin), as well as procyanidins and prodelphinidins oligomers. The tannins are formed by enzymes during metabolic processes of the grapevine. The amount of tannins found naturally in grapes varies depending on the variety with Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Syrah and Tannat being 4 of the most tannic grape varieties. The reaction of tannins and anthocyanins with the phenolic compound catechins creates another class of tannins known as pigmented tannins which influence the color of red wine. Commercial preparations of tannins, known as enological tannins, made from oak wood, grape seed and skin, <b>plant</b> <b>gall,</b> chestnut, quebracho, gambier and myrobalan fruits, can be added at different stages of the wine production to improve color durability. The tannins derived from oak influence are known as [...] "hydrolysable tannins" [...] being created from the ellagic and gallic acid found in the wood.In the vineyards, there is also a growing distinction being made between [...] "ripe" [...] and [...] "unripe" [...] tannins present in the grape. This [...] "physiological ripeness", which is roughly determined by tasting the grapes off the vines, is being used along with sugar levels as a determination of when to harvest. The idea is that [...] "riper" [...] tannins will taste softer but still impart some of the texture components found favorable in wine. In winemaking, the amount of the time that the must spends in contact with the grape skins, stems and seeds will influence the amount of tannins that are present in the wine with wines subjected to longer maceration period having more tannin extract. Following harvest, stems are normally picked out and discarded prior to fermentation but some winemakers may intentionally leave in a few stems for varieties low in tannins (like Pinot noir) in order to increase the tannic extract in the wine. If there is an excess in the amount of tannins in the wine, winemakers can use various fining agents like albumin, casein and gelatin that can bind to tannins molecule and precipitate them out as sediments. As a wine ages, tannins will form long polymerized chains which come across to a taster as [...] "softer" [...] and less tannic. This process can be accelerated by exposing the wine to oxygen, which oxidize tannins to quinone-like compounds that are polymerization-prone. The winemaking technique of micro-oxygenation and decanting wine use oxygen to partially mimic the effect of aging on tannins.|$|E

40|$|The {{monosaccharide}} and polyalcohol {{composition of}} 28 -samples of different commercial tannins, including oak wood, grape seed and skin, <b>plant</b> <b>gall,</b> chestnut, quebracho and gambier, has been evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after derivatization into their trimethylsilyl ethers. Quercitol {{was found to}} be characteristic of oak tannins, whereas gall plant tannins could be differentiated by their content of pinitol. Myo-inositol and arabitol were detected in tannins from quebracho. These polyalcohols, together with muco-inositol and chiro-inositol, were found in tannins from chestnut while bornesitol {{was found to be}} characteristic of tannins from gambier. Monosaccharide composition also helped to distinguish among tannin origins: arabinose, xylose, fructose and glucose were quantified in oak, quebracho and chestnut tannins, whereas only fructose and glucose were detected in <b>plant</b> <b>gall</b> and grape tannins. These results imply that the qualitative study of monosaccharides and polyalcohols could help to determine and control the authenticity of enological tannins.
