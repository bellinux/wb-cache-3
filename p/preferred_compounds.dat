40|$|Bcakground: Extracts {{obtained}} from natural {{sources such as}} plants are of immense importance for humans. Methods: Therefore {{this study was conducted}} to obtain essential oil from the seeds of T. ammi by conventional and non-conventional methods. Hydrodistillation (HD), Solvent Extraction (SE), Ultrasonication (US), and Supercritical Carbon-dioxide (SC-CO 2) extraction techniques were used to extract essential oil from the powdered seeds of T. ammi. A quality control method for each extracted oil was developed using HPTLC, FTIR, and GC-MS. The optimization process was carried out using fractional factorial design (FFD) under which three parameters were considered: pressure (150, 175, and 300 bar), temperature (25, 30, and 40 °C), and CO 2 flow rate (5, 10, 15 g/min). Results: The yield of essential oil {{obtained from}} the HD, SE, US, and SC-CO 2 methods were 1. 20 %, 1. 82 %, 2. 30 %, and 2. 64 % v/w, respectively.

40|$|The nitroheterocycle nifurtimox, {{as part of}} a nifurtimox-eflornithine {{combination}} therapy, {{represents one}} of a limited number of treatments targeting Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis. The mode of action of this prodrug involves an initial activation reaction catalysed by a type I nitroreductase (NTR), an enzyme found predominantly in prokaryotes, leading to the formation of a cytotoxic unsaturated open chain nitrile metabolite. Here, we evaluate the trypanocidal activity of a library of other 5 -nitrofurans against bloodstream form T. brucei as a preliminary step in the identification of additional nitroaromatic compounds that could potentially partner eflornithine. Biochemical screening against purified enzyme revealed that all 5 -nitrofurans were effective substrates for TbNTR with the <b>preferred</b> <b>compounds</b> having apparent k(cat) /K(M) values approximately 50 -fold greater than nifurtimox. For several compounds, in vitro reduction by this nitroreductase yielded products characterized by mass spectroscopy as either unsaturated or saturated open chain nitriles. When tested against bloodstream form T. brucei, many of the derivatives displayed significant growth inhibitory properties with the most potent compounds generating IC(50) values around 200 nM. The anti-parasitic activity of the most potent agents was demonstrated to be NTR dependent as parasites having reduced levels of the enzyme displayed resistance to the compounds while parasites over expressing TbNTR showed hypersensitivity. We conclude that other members of the 5 -nitrofurans class of nitroheterocycles have potential to treat human African trypanosomiasis perhaps as an alternative partner prodrug to nifurtimox in the next generation of eflornithine-based combinational therapies...|$|E

40|$|The fumarate reductase enzyme complex allows Escherichia coli to grow anaerobically with fumarate as a {{terminal}} electron acceptor for oxidative phosphorylation when the <b>preferred</b> <b>compounds</b> oxygen and nitrate are not available. We used the pKO promoter test vectors {{to identify a}} single promoter for the frdABCD genes which encode fumarate reductase. Expression of galactokinase from the frd promoter-galK operon fusion plasmid was repressed by oxygen and by nitrate and was induced by fumarate, indicating that frd gene expression is regulated {{at the transcriptional level}} by these terminal electron acceptors. S 1 nuclease analysis, using a single-stranded DNA probe from the frd promoter region and mRNA isolated from a fumarate reductase-induced culture, revealed that the frd mRNA transcript initiates with an adenine residue 93 bases {{prior to the start of}} frdA translation. No promoters internal to the frd genes were revealed with the plasmid promoter screening system. S 1 nuclease analysis revealed that the frd mRNA terminates in a uridine-rich region centered at 46 bases after the last codon of frdD. A stem and loop structure previously described as the growth rate-dependent attenuator for the linked ampC gene precedes the frd mRNA terminus. This result confirms the proposal that the stem and loop structure serves the dual role of a frd terminator anaerobically and an ampC attenuator aerobically. The four frd genes encoding the subunits of the fumarate reductase complex thus comprise an operon which is regulated at the transcriptional level in response to the cellular availability of the alternate electron acceptors oxygen, nitrate, and fumarate...|$|E
50|$|Earlier workers {{suggested}} {{the use of}} calcium fluoride; now sodium fluoride is the <b>preferred</b> <b>compound.</b> Fluoride ions inhibit the rapid progression of disease. In the otosclerotic ear, there occurs formation of hydroxylapatite crystals which lead to stapes (or other) fixation. The administration of fluoride replaces the hydroxyl radical with fluoride leading {{to the formation of}} fluorapatite crystals. Hence, the progression of disease is considerably slowed down and active disease process is arrested.This treatment cannot reverse conductive hearing loss, but may slow the progression of both the conductive and sensorineural components of the disease process. Otofluor, containing sodium fluoride, is one treatment. Recently, some success has been claimed with a second such treatment, bisphosphonate medications that inhibit bone destruction. However, these early reports are based on non-randomized case studies that do not meet standards of clinical trials. There are numerous side-effects to both pharmaceutical treatments, including occasional stomach upset, allergic itching, and increased joint pains which can lead to arthritis. In the worst case, bisphosphonates may lead to osteonecrosis of the auditory canal itself. Finally, neither approach has been proven to be beneficial after the commonly preferred method of surgery has been undertaken.|$|R

Evidence exists for interactions between each combination of Slit, Robo and heparin/HS and for formation of a ternary complex. Heparin/HS are complex mixtures displaying extensive structural diversity. The relevance of this diversity has been studied to a limited extent using a few select chemically-modified heparins as models of HS diversity. Here we extend these studies by parallel screening of structurally diverse panels of eight chemically-modified heparin polysaccharides and numerous natural HS oligosaccharide chromatographic fractions for binding to both Drosophila Slit and Robo N-terminal domains and for activation of a chick retina axon response to the Slit fragment. Both the polysaccharides and oligosaccharide fractions displayed variability in binding and cellular activity {{that could not be}} attributed solely to increasing sulfation, extending evidence for the importance of structural diversity to natural HS as well as model modified heparins. They also displayed differences in their interactions with Slit compared to Robo, with Robo <b>preferring</b> <b>compounds</b> with higher sulfation.

40|$|The antiestrogens {{represent}} {{a group of}} compounds, not necessarily steroidal, which are able to decrease the specific uptake of estrogens in vitro and in vivo by various target tissues in the rat and in man. This action is explained either by competitive binding to estrogen receptor sites or, more probably, by failure of the antiestrogen complex, translocated into the nucleus, to stimulate neoformation of receptors in the cytoplasm. This explains the transient estrogenic effect of antiestrogen. Antiestrogens used in humans are hormone specific and antagonize also non-steroidal estrogens, like stilbestrol. Three compounds {{have been used in}} advanced breast cancer with the same indications as the older hormonal treatments. They are clomiphene citrate, nafoxidine and tamoxifen. Nafoxidine and tamoxifen are probably equally active. The response rate is between 28 and 35 %, with a median duration of nine months. Nafoxidine is toxic for the skin and tamoxifen is the <b>preferred</b> <b>compound.</b> A randomized trial comparing ethinyl estradiol and an antiestrogen showed similar rates of response with the two compounds in advanced breast cancer. The uniformity of results of treatment of advanced breast cancer by hormonal agents including antiestrogens and their limitations, probably justifies the present day concept which assigns hormonal treatment a secondary role, either as a supplement to cytotoxic chemotherapy or for old and debilitated patients. However, as a supplement to chemotherapy, hormonal agents are probably important since recent studies have shown that apparently all breast cancers have positive receptor sites, albeit in variable amounts. Because of their lack of toxicity, antiestrogens are probably the best hormonal agents available at present. SCOPUS: re. jFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
