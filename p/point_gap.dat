Atias' coach got the score adjusted to 7:0 after a discussion with the judges. Teixeira's success continued, scoring 16 total points {{by the end of}} the third round. Atias' only scored two points after being penalized for an illegal kick to the legs. Atias lost in the round of 16 against Venilton Teixeira from Brazil by <b>point</b> <b>gap</b> of 2–16. Atias would have had a chance to compete for the bronze medal if Teixeira reached the finals, however he failed to do so and therefore Atias was eliminated from competition.|$|E
25|$|Despite Shakhtar {{not being}} a strong {{contender}} for the championship at the time, finishing second many times with a large <b>point</b> <b>gap</b> from the first-place position, they won the Ukrainian Cup three times, in 1995 (under the management of former player Vladimir Salkov), 1997 and 2001. In the 1997–98 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, Shakhtar were eliminated after a 5–2 aggregate loss to Vicenza, losing {{the first and second}} legs. Important players at the time were defenders Serhiy Popov and Mykhaylo Starostyak, goalkeeper Dmytro Shutkov, striker Oleh Matveyev (who was top scorer of the Premier League in the 1996–97 season), and midfielders Hennadiy Orbu, Valeriy Kriventsov and Ihor Petrov. Most of the players playing for the team of the time came through the team's youth ranks.|$|E
25|$|Early in the 2008 Major League Soccer season, {{the league}} {{announced}} that the championship would be returning to Home Depot Center. Throughout the regular season, the league was dominated by the Columbus Crew, who finished the season with 57 points, and secured the Supporters' Shield title with three matches remaining before the 2008 MLS Cup Playoffs. Traditionally, the Shield winners only rarely {{made it to the}} league championship, in spite of usually being the heavy favorites going into the playoffs. However, {{for the first time in}} eight years, a regular season champion made it to the MLS Cup final. The Sigi Schmid-led club made their first ever run to the championship, along with their opponents the New York Red Bulls. For the Crew, being the Shield winners, their run to the final was a bit expected. The Red Bulls making the final was seen as a large surprise, possibly even a fluke. The Red Bulls did not qualify for the playoffs until the last day of the season, where they were the weakest team, in terms of regular season record, to qualify for the playoffs. The match ended up being dominated by the Crew as Columbus defeated New York with ease, 3–1. The <b>point</b> <b>gap</b> between the two clubs was the largest in history, and the scoreline between the two clubs made it tied for the largest margin of victory in MLS Cup history. New York's run to the finals was further emphasized as a fluke when the club had the worst record in 2009.|$|E

His charge was halted by Max Verstappen, {{who took his}} maiden win in Spain in his debut race for Red Bull. After that, the reigning champion Lewis Hamilton decreased the <b>point</b> <b>gap</b> between him and Rosberg to only one point, before taking the championship lead heading into the summer break. Following the break, the 1–2 positioning remained constant until an engine failure for Hamilton in Malaysia left Rosberg in a commanding lead {{that he would not}} relinquish in the 5 remaining races. Having won the title by a mere 5 points, Rosberg retired from Formula One at season's end. The final team remaining from the 2010 new entries process, Manor Racing, withdrew from the sport following the 2016 season, having lost 10th in the Constructors' Championship to Sauber with one race remaining, leaving the grid at 20 cars as Liberty Media took control of the series in the off-season.|$|E

The club maintained the six <b>point</b> <b>gap</b> in the two following fixtures, by winning 3-1 at home against Kalmar and defeating newcomers Falkenberg 5-2 on the road. The six <b>point</b> <b>gap</b> was reduced down to a four-point lead after a drawn home fixture against IFK Göteborg in the 18th round as AIK won their fixture in the same round. However the lead was again increased to six points in the following round as Malmö FF turned 0-2 at half-time against Örebro at home to 3-2 in full-time in the 19th round. The lead was increased further to a seven-point gap in the 20th round when Malmö FF tied an away fixture against Gefle {{at the same time}} as AIK lost against Örebro.|$|E

40|$|A <b>point</b> machine’s <b>gap</b> is an {{important}} indication of its healthy status. An edge detection algorithm is proposed to measure and calculate a <b>point</b> machine’s <b>gap</b> from the gap image captured by CCD plane arrays. This algorithm integrates adaptive wavelet-based image denoising, locally adaptive image binarization, and mathematical morphology technologies. The adaptive wavelet-based image denoising obtains not only an optimal denoising threshold, but also unblurred edges. Locally adaptive image binarization {{has the advantage of}} overcoming the local intensity variation in gap images. Mathematical morphology may suppress speckle spots caused by reflective metal surfaces in point machines. The subjective and objective evaluations of the proposed method are presented by using <b>point</b> machine <b>gap</b> images from a railway corporation in China. The performance between the proposed method and conventional edge detection methods has also been compared, and the result shows that the former outperforms the latter...|$|R
