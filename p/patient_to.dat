5|$|The {{accessory}} nerve is tested by evaluating {{the function of}} the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles. The trapezius muscle is tested by asking the <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> shrug their shoulders with and without resistance. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is tested by asking the <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> turn their head to the left or right against resistance.|$|E

50|$|Another {{benefit of}} using SBAR {{is that it}} allows <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> have the time to ask any {{questions}} that they might have, and allows <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> gain exact knowledge of information related to their plan of care. SBAR allows <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> be fully aware of whom their nurse is on every shift and this adds <b>to</b> the <b>patients</b> sense of comfort knowing that there will always be someone around looking after them during shift change.|$|R
5|$|Dr John Belisario (1820–1900), dentist at {{the later}} {{end of the}} 19th century, {{recorded}} as living in Summer Hill in the 1891 census; first dentist in Australia to administer ether to a <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> carry out dental work.|$|E
5|$|A {{structured}} {{assessment of}} speech includes {{an assessment of}} expressive language by asking the <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> name objects, repeat short sentences, or produce as many words as possible from a certain category in a set time. Simple language tests form part of the mini-mental state examination. In practice, the structured assessment of receptive and expressive language is often reported under Cognition (see below).|$|E
5|$|Ambulance design {{must take}} into account local {{conditions}} and infrastructure. Maintained roads are necessary for road going ambulances to arrive on scene and then transport the <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> a hospital, though in rugged areas four-wheel drive or all-terrain vehicles can be used. Fuel must be available and service facilities are necessary to maintain the vehicle.|$|E

50|$|Other health {{conditions}} such as diabetes, abnormal blood clotting, ostomies, and obesity do not usually present a problem to experienced surgeons. The conditions do increase the anesthetic risk {{and the rate of}} post-operative complications. Surgeons may require overweight <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> reduce their weight before surgery, any <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> refrain from hormone replacement before surgery and smoking <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> refrain from smoking before and after surgery. Surgeons commonly stipulate the latter regardless of the type of operation.|$|R
50|$|Patients {{may need}} pain {{relievers}} to control pain. Other medications {{that are used}} to reduce pain include gabapentin, carbamazepine, or tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline. Whenever if possible, <b>Patients</b> need <b>to</b> avoid or limit the use of medication {{to reduce the risk of}} side effects. If the pain is severe, a pain specialist can help <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> explore all options to relieve the pain. Physical therapy exercises may help <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> maintain muscle strength. Also, orthopedic devices may improve <b>patient's</b> ability <b>to</b> walk and prevent contractures. Orthopedic devices may include braces, splints, orthopedic shoes, or other equipment.Vocational counseling, occupational therapy, or similar programs may help <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> maximize their mobility and independence.|$|R

5|$|In {{two small}} studies of two {{patients}} and another with one patient suffering from recurrent CSF leaks where repeated blood patches failed to form clots and relieve symptoms, the patients received temporary but complete resolution of symptoms with an epidural saline infusion. The saline infusion temporarily restores the volume {{necessary for a}} <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> avoid SIH until the leak can be repaired properly. Intrathecal saline infusion is used in urgent cases such as intractable pain or decreased consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Social Worker: Every {{patient is}} {{assigned}} {{a social worker}} who visits {{at the time of}} admission to hospice. The social worker function can vary from providing superficial support to patients and families to intensive crisis-oriented counseling. Additionally, with a terminal illness often comes more complicated financial stressors; the social worker can be instrumental in connecting the patient and family with community resources including services such as Meals on Wheels. Lastly, if a patient is unable to be cared for at home, the social worker will work to find a safer place for the <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> receive hospice care.|$|E

5|$|The Finnhorse is also well-suited to riding therapy, being {{calm and}} steady, hard-working, obedient, healthy and enduring. They are {{small enough to}} allow the <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> be {{assisted}} easily, yet large enough to have gaits that stimulate the muscles, senses, and balance of the rider. Many Finnhorses have also been trained for driving, and therefore are familiar with unusual noises and can be controlled from behind, and ex-trotters are inexpensive. Many Finns also find {{the appearance of the}} Finnhorse comforting.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} {{required}} to build an environment that will attract patients with comical diseases and then treat them while tending to their needs. The game has a somewhat dark sense of humour, {{similar to that of}} its predecessor, Theme Park. Diseases include Bloaty Head (which swells the patient's head), King Complex (which forces the <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> impersonate Elvis Presley), and Alien DNA (which transforms the patient into an alien).|$|E
5|$|Withdrawal is best {{managed by}} {{transferring}} the physically dependent <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> an equivalent dose of diazepam {{because it has}} the longest half-life {{of all of the}} benzodiazepines, is metabolised into long-acting active metabolites and is available in low-potency tablets, which can be quartered for smaller doses. A further benefit is that it is available in liquid form, which allows for even smaller reductions. Chlordiazepoxide, which also has a long half-life and long-acting active metabolites, can be used as an alternative.|$|E
50|$|Independent pharmacists provide {{diabetes}} {{care and}} management <b>to</b> help <b>patients</b> achieve therapeutic and lifestyle goals. Pharmacists screen patients {{at high risk}} for diabetes, assess patient health status, educate <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> care for themselves, monitor outcomes, and when appropriate, refer <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> other health care professionals. Some independent pharmacists provide patients with diabetes self-management education/training (DSME/T) that teaches <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> adhere to the standards of care including, but not limited to, healthy diet, physical exercise, medication, self-monitoring, healthy coping and behavior change, and reducing risks (i.e. diabetic foot care).|$|R

5|$|A {{radiographic}} evaluation {{using an}} X-ray, CT scan, or MRI can {{determine if there}} is damage to the spinal column {{and where it is}} located. X-rays are commonly available and can detect instability or misalignment of the spinal column, but do not give very detailed images and can miss injuries to the spinal cord or displacement of ligaments or disks that do not have accompanying spinal column damage. Thus when X-ray findings are normal but SCI is still suspected due to pain or SCI symptoms, CT or MRI scans are used. CT gives greater detail than X-rays, but exposes the <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> more radiation, and it still does not give images of the spinal cord or ligaments; MRI shows body structures in the greatest detail. Thus it is the standard for anyone who has neurological deficits found in SCI or is thought to have an unstable spinal column injury.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 19 {{percent of}} all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called {{respiratory}} or bulbospinal polio. Here, the virus affects {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and paralysis of the diaphragm occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which drives the diaphragm to inflate the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> breathe without the support of a ventilator. It can lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are used}} recreationally and by {{problematic}} drug misusers. Mortality is higher among poly-drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly-drug users. Dependence and tolerance, often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; withdrawal syndrome may appear after {{as little as}} three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use {{has the potential to}} cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of panic attacks), and agoraphobia. Benzodiazepines and, in particular, temazepam are sometimes used intravenously, which, if done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including abscesses, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, arterial puncture, deep vein thrombosis, and gangrene. Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. Benzodiazepines are also misused intranasally, which may have additional health consequences. Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established, a clinician usually converts the <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> an equivalent dose of diazepam before beginning a gradual reduction program.|$|E

5|$|Bradykinesia (slowness of movement) {{is found}} in every case of PD, and is due to {{disturbances}} in motor planning of movement initiation, and associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation to execution of a movement. Performance of sequential and simultaneous movement is impaired. Bradykinesia is the most handicapping symptom of Parkinson’s disease leading to difficulties with everyday tasks such as dressing, feeding, and bathing. It leads to particular difficulty in carrying out two independent motor activities {{at the same time}} and can be made worse by emotional stress or concurrent illnesses. Paradoxically patients with Parkinson's disease can often ride a bicycle or climb stairs more easily than walk on a level. While most physicians may readily notice bradykinesia, formal assessment requires a <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> do repetitive movements with their fingers and feet.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} {{there may be}} an {{asymptomatic}} phase following the initial symptoms which is then followed by more significant toxicity including kidney damage, liver damage, and neurological dysfunction including seizures and coma. These signs usually develop within 1–3days in serious cases. The patient develops jaundice and the liver and spleen become enlarged, in some cases blood sugar levels will rise (hyperglycemia) and then fall (hypoglycemia) and liver toxicity is seen. Additionally intravascular hemolysis causes destruction of red blood cells resulting in increase in free hemoglobin and hemoglobinuria which can lead to renal toxicity or renal failure. Methemoglobinemia may also occur in some cases. This is where higher than normal levels of methemoglobin, which is a form of hemoglobin that can not carry oxygen, are found in the blood. It causes the <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> become short of breath and cyanotic. Cases of severe poisoning may progress to a terminal neurological phase, with delirium, muscle fasciculations and seizures, and mydriasis progressing to coma, circulatory collapse, and respiratory arrest. Death may occur from five to seven days after consumption.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides). MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system. The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on twelve children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.|$|E
