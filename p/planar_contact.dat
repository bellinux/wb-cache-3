40|$|International audienceDuring micro-assembly processes, <b>planar</b> <b>contacts</b> {{often appear}} (between two {{manipulated}} components, one manipulated component and its gripping tool or substrate). Adhesion forces being predominant at the microscale, such contacts have important consequences on assembly strategies. One of these adhesion forces is the pull-off force {{which is the}} necessary force to break a contact. This article focuses on the measurement of pull-off force of micrometric <b>planar</b> <b>contacts</b> (50 x 50 m 2) and shows {{that it can be}} in the range of several hundreds of microNewtons. Consequences of this pull-off force on assembly strategy, especially guiding tasks, are then introduced.

Three aspects are investigated: (i) the quality of the single crystalline layers and the NWs, (ii) strain relaxation of the implanted NWs and (iii) dopant activation of the layers and NWs. Optimization of the doping conditions resulted into very low contact resistivities of NiSi contacts on strained and unstrained 70 nm SOI layers and Si NWs.

Apart from the primary resonance, a number of super-harmonic resonances has been excited in the non-linear single-degree-of-freedom system. Hence, a resonance graph contains a number of peaks being below the natural frequency. The contact vibrations are associated with strongly non-linear phenomena like: asymmetry of vibrations, loss of contact, bending resonance peak, multi-stability, period-doubling bifurcations, chaotic vibrations, which are far from linear dynamics.

When phonons in the contacts have lower average frequencies than those in the wires thermal transport occurs under conditions away from local equilibrium with low-frequency phonons experiencing a higher thermal gradient than high-frequency ones. This results in a size-dependent increase in the effective thermal conductivity of the wire with decreasing vibrational frequencies of the contacts. The interfacial resistivity when heat flows from the wire to the contact is also size-dependent and has the same physical origin in the lack of full equilibration in short nanowires.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{manipulation}} of a grasped object by pushing it against its environment. Relying on precise arm motions and detailed models of frictional contact, prehensile pushing enables dexterous manipulation with simple manipulators, such as those currently available in industrial settings, and those likely affordable by service and field robots. This paper {{is concerned with the}} mechanics of the forceful interaction between a gripper, a grasped object, and its environment. In particular, we describe the quasi-dynamic motion of an object held by a set of point, line, or <b>planar</b> rigid frictional <b>contacts</b> and forced by an external pusher (the environment). Our model predicts the force required by the external pusher to “break” the equilibrium of the grasp and estimates the instantaneous motion of the object in the grasp. It also captures interesting behaviors such as the constraining effect of line or <b>planar</b> <b>contacts</b> and the guiding effect of the pusher’s motion on the objects’s motion. We evaluate the algorithm with three primitive prehensile pushing actions—straight sliding, pivoting, and rolling—with the potential to combine into a broader in-hand manipulation capability.
