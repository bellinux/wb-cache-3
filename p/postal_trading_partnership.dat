5000|$|In mid-2007, the Blackstone group, a major {{private equity}} fund, went public. Ordinarily, a {{publicly}} <b>traded</b> <b>partnership</b> is taxed as a corporation. [...] There is, however, {{an exception for}} publicly <b>traded</b> <b>partnerships</b> earning only “passive-type” income, such as interest and dividends. [...] Although the investments made by a private equity fund are actively managed, Blackstone took {{the position that the}} investments they engaged in fell squarely within literal language of this exception to the usual treatment for publicly <b>traded</b> <b>partnerships.</b> [...] To address what they viewed as a loophole in the law, Senators Baucus and Grassley introduced S. 1624, which would remove the ability for publicly <b>traded</b> <b>partnerships</b> performing asset-management and related services to avoid being taxed ascorporations. [...] The result of this bill would be to change the tax treatment of private equity and hedge funds from a single level of taxation at a 15% rate (or 35% in the case of most hedge funds) to a corporate-level tax of 35%, plus a 15% tax on dividends when distributed. While acknowledging that there are concerns with the current treatment of publicly <b>traded</b> <b>partnerships,</b> Treasury Secretary Paulson has declined to endorse the treatment that would be provided under S. 1624.|$|R
