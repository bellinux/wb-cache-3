5|$|As the {{mountains}} are eroded, {{more and more}} sand is created. At high wind speeds, sand grains are picked up off the surface and blown along, {{a process known as}} saltation. The whirling airborne grains act as a sand blasting mechanism which grinds away solid objects in its <b>path</b> <b>as</b> the kinetic energy of the wind is transferred to the ground. The sand eventually ends up deposited in level areas known as sand-fields or sand-seas, or piled up in dunes.|$|E

In this paper, we systematically analyze <b>AS</b> <b>paths</b> and quantify {{the extent to which}} routing policies inflate <b>AS</b> <b>paths.</b> The results show that <b>AS</b> <b>path</b> inflation in the Internet is more prevalent than expected.

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Saydel High School in 1983, Robinson {{spent the summer}} {{deciding}} on her career <b>path</b> <b>as</b> {{she worked as a}} department store cashier. She went with her father to help him promote local races. Robinson persuaded him to let her compete in racing, and started off at Toledo Speedway driving a 1976 International semi-tractor. She participated in a five-lap sprint race where she finished second after leading for four laps, and took third position in the feature event. After this Robinson began racing full-time, and won 30 feature races before moving to the super-speedway division in April 1984; she faced early resentment from her male competitors. In the same year, Robinson moved from Iowa to Pennsylvania. Lefty believed Robinson's presence helped to increase fans' interest. Robinson's father acted as her mentor although her mother was against her racing because she felt she would be hurt in a crash.|$|E

5|$|August 15, 1787: The Four-State Tornado Swarm of 1787 was {{the largest}} tornado {{outbreak}} recorded to date, and affected most of New England. The first in the state touched down around 1:30PM near New Britain, traveling along nearly the same <b>path</b> <b>as</b> a tornado in 1728 or 1729. This tornado was nearly as violent as the Wallingford Tornado of 1878. A mother and two of her children were killed in Wethersfield, and 10 others were injured before the tornado lifted outside of the town. What may have been another tornado caused additional damage as far east as Coventry. Another tornado struck East Windsor, damaging several homes and barns. Yet another touched down near Killingly, moving northeast into Rhode Island and Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Bax {{was born}} in the London suburb of Streatham to a prosperous family. He was {{encouraged}} by his parents to pursue a career in music, and his private income enabled him to follow his own <b>path</b> <b>as</b> a composer without regard for fashion or orthodoxy. Consequently, he came to be regarded in musical circles as an important but isolated figure. While still a student at the Royal Academy of Music Bax became fascinated with Ireland and Celtic culture, which became a strong influence on his early development. In the years before the First World War he lived in Ireland and became a member of Dublin literary circles, writing fiction and verse under the pseudonym Dermot O'Byrne. Later, he developed an affinity with Nordic culture, which for a time superseded his Celtic influences in the years after the First World War.|$|E
5|$|In 2069, the {{unmanned}} Sun Probe locates {{a planet}} {{lying on the}} same orbital <b>path</b> <b>as</b> Earth {{on the opposite side}} of the Sun. Dr Kurt Hassler (Herbert Lom) of the European Space Exploration Council (EUROSEC) has been relaying the spacecraft's flight data to a rival power in the East; after tracing the transmissions to Hassler's laboratory, Security Chief Mark Neuman (George Sewell) catches the scientist in the act and kills him. EUROSEC director Jason Webb (Patrick Wymark) convinces NASA representative David Poulson (Ed Bishop) that the West must be the first to send a mission to investigate the planet. With EUROSEC member states France and Germany unwilling to provide financial support, Webb obtains funding from NASA; American astronaut Colonel Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) and British astrophysicist Dr John Kane (Ian Hendry), the head of the Sun Probe project, are assigned to the mission.|$|E

In this paper, we systematically analyze <b>AS</b> <b>paths</b> and quantify {{the extent to which}} routing policies inflate <b>AS</b> <b>paths.</b> The results show that <b>AS</b> <b>path</b> inflation in the Internet is more prevalent than expected. We first present the extent of <b>AS</b> <b>path</b> inflation observed from the RouteView and RIPE routing tables. We then employ three common routing policies to show the extent of <b>AS</b> <b>path</b> inflation. We find that No-Valley routing policy causes the least <b>AS</b> <b>path</b> inflation among the three routing policies. PreferCustomer-and-Peer-over-Provider policy causes the most <b>AS</b> <b>path</b> inflation. In addition, we find that single-homed stub ASes experience more path inflations than transit ASes and multi-homed ASes. The AS pairs with shortest <b>AS</b> <b>path</b> of 3 <b>AS</b> hops experience more path inflations than other AS pairs. Finally, we investigate the <b>AS</b> <b>path</b> inflation on the end-to-end path from end users to two popular content providers, Google and Comcast. Although the majority of the shortest <b>AS</b> <b>paths</b> from end users to the two providers consists of no more than three AS hops, the actual end-to-end paths that the traffic will take are longer than the shortest <b>AS</b> <b>paths</b> in many cases. Quantifying <b>AS</b> <b>path</b> inflation in the Internet has important implications on the extent of routing policies, traffic engineering performed on the Internet, and BGP convergence speed...|$|R

5|$|In early 1594, the Serbs in Banat rose {{up against}} the Ottomans. The rebels had, in the {{character}} of a holy war, carried war flags with the icon of Saint Sava. The war banners were consecrated by Patriarch Jovan Kantul, and the uprising was aided by Serbian Orthodox metropolitans Rufim Njeguš of Cetinje and Visarion of Trebinje (s. 1590–1602). In response, Ottoman Grand Vizier Koca Sinan Pasha demanded that the green flag of the Prophet Muhammed be brought from Damascus to counter the Serb flag and ordered that the sarcophagus containing the relics of Saint Sava be removed from the Mileševa monastery and transferred to Belgrade via military convoy. Along the way, the Ottoman convoy killed all the people in its <b>path</b> <b>as</b> a warning to the rebels. The Ottomans publicly incinerated the relics of Saint Sava on a pyre atop the Vračar plateau on April 27, 1595, and had the ashes scattered.|$|E
5|$|In general, Bret was {{forecast}} {{to track}} farther north than it ultimately did. About 24hours {{in advance of}} the storm, tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued for the southern Lesser Antilles and Venezuela. The first tropical storm watch was posted late on August5 from Dominica southward to Trinidad. On the next day, this was upgraded to a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch from Saint Lucia to Trinidad. Tropical storm warnings spread westward through Venezuela along the storm's <b>path,</b> <b>as</b> well as the ABC islands and northern Colombia along the Guajira Peninsula. Later when Bret began reorganizing in the southwestern Caribbean, portions of Nicaragua were under a tropical storm warning only nine hours before the storm struck. The warning covered from Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua through the entirety of the Costa Rican coastline, as well as San Andrés island offshore.|$|E

Like a contemporary, Shen Kuo (1031–1095), Su Song was a polymath, a person whose {{expertise}} spans a significant number of different interests. It was written by his junior colleague and Hanlin scholar Ye Mengde (1077–1148) that in Su's youth, he mastered the provincial exams and rose {{to the top of the}} examination list for writing the best essay on general principles and structure of the Chinese calendar. From an early age, his interests in astronomy and calendrical science led him onto a distinguished <b>path</b> <b>as</b> a state bureaucrat. In his spare time he was fond of writing poetry, which he used to praise the works of artists such as the painter Li Gonglin (1049–1106).
