In an effort to determine the effectiveness of technology integration for speech language therapy, this action research project focused on the use of a computer <b>program,</b> <b>Sound</b> Therapy Lite, by first-and second-grade students to address specific articulation goals for each student. The target group consisted of 10 randomly selected students aged 6 - 7 years old who were previously placed in the speech-language resource program for remediation of articulation disorders. Students utilized the Sound Therapy Lite program for a 3 -week period. At the end of the intervention, progress with students ’ speech-language goals was noted. Also, findings indicated an increase in students ’ self-esteem and an overall satisfaction {{with the use of the}} <b>program,</b> <b>Sound</b> Therapy Lite...|$|E

To appraise the predicted grade of Yueqin, two professors from Chinese Conservatory of Music who are practiced instrument lists of national musical instrument were invited to carry out the evaluation.

According to the most significant factors influencing the acoustic quality of Yueqin, the dynamic modulus of elasticity E / [...]. - 0 ptρ, elasticity modulus and shear modulus ratio E / [...]. - 0 pt G, acoustic damping coefficient R, and acoustic impedance ω, four evaluation indexes and three grades were used to evaluate the Yueqin soundboard wood vibration performance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{proposed}} {{system for}} determining hearing threshold consists of calibration application and audiometric application. The calibration application generates a file containing an information on sound (Pure Tones) amplitudes (Vpp) corresponding to certain sound level of Audiometer V 1. The sampling frequency of generated sounds is 44. 1 kHz with 16 -bit coding. In calibration procedure the sounds are generated in right channel. Instead of “artificial ear”, as proposed in [4], an artificial head with built in sound measuring capsule is used. Audiometric application Audiometer V 1 enables determining hearing threshold of both ears with results given on graphic file. Sounds are generated by computer <b>program</b> (<b>sound</b> samples are not used). Sampling frequency of generated sounds is 44. 1 kHz and their quality {{is good enough}} for proposed application. Signal amplitude is peak-to-peak voltage Vpp and it corresponds to the sound volume level of speaker. The smallest difference between sounds of the same frequency is 5 dB. Application Audiometer V 1 enables the testng of the hearing threshold in frequencies: 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, 4000 Hz and 8000 Hz. In contrary to available audiometers, the proposed solution is universal; it permits optional testing, and is very cheap...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} parent-delivered {{instruction}} on children 2 ̆ 7 s phonemic awareness were investigated. Participants were thirty-eight {{parents and their}} pre-school children. The {{purpose of this study}} was to: (1) investigate whether parents could successfully teach phoneme identification skills to preschool children; (2) assess whether the effects of parent-delivered instruction on phonemic awareness and the alphabetic principle could be independent of pretest letter knowledge, child vocabulary and cognitive ability, and SES; (3) determine whether training would generalize to recognition of untrained phonemes; and (4) assess parent satisfaction with the training and instructional program. Children were matched based on vocabulary scores. This measure was also a proxy for SES (Hart 2 ̆ 6 Risley, 1995). Children were then randomly assigned to either treatment or control groups. In addition, pretest letter knowledge was assessed using experimental measures designed by Byrne and Fielding-Barnsley (1991). Parents taught their child to identify initial and ending phonemes and letter-sounds based on the early literacy <b>program</b> <b>Sound</b> Foundations (Byrne 2 ̆ 6 Fielding-Barnsley, 1991), with lesson scripts based on explicit, direct instruction techniques (Kameenui 2 ̆ 6 Carnine, 1998; Swanson, Hoskyn 2 ̆ 6 Lee, 1999). The duration of the program was 7 weeks. Children were required to find poster pictures that began or ended with the target sound and to color pictures with the target sound. Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) (Good 2 ̆ 6 Kaminski, 2002) were used to measure Initial Sound Fluency and Letter Naming Fluency. Experimental measures of ending sound fluency, initial phoneme transfer and ending phoneme transfer were also used to measure outcomes. A survey was used to obtain social validity data regarding parent satisfaction with the program. Results indicated that: (a) there was a large, albeit insignificant effect for parent training on children 2 ̆ 7 s initial sound fluency (d = 1. 1, p 3 ̆c. 006); (b) parent training was not predictive of letter naming fluency (p =. 07); (c) there were no significant differences on measures of phoneme transfer; and (d) pretest letter knowledge was predictive of outcomes on letter naming fluency (p 3 ̆c. 01). Parents reported a high degree of satisfaction with training. The discussion focuses on future research on early literacy instruction and parent-delivered instruction. ...|$|E
