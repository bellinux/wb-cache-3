We combine these techniques into a multiresolution model. A coarse-level simulation is sampled to yield keyframes. Then a physical motion between keyframes is calculated and distorted to meet its boundary conditions. We demonstrate these ideas with a simple virtual world consisting of wind blowing trees and leaves that can be entered and experienced efficiently at any point in time. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{collect data}} on the record of every action in over one {{thousand}} cases involving public companies from 2004 to 2011 in the Delaware Court of Chancery, which is the leading court for corporate law disputes in the United States. We use these data to estimate how markets respond to Delaware litigation events and characteristics such as case initiations, <b>procedural</b> <b>motions,</b> case quality, and judge identity. We find that negative abnormal returns {{are associated with the}} filing of derivative and contract cases, but we observe little effect associated with the filing of the average merger challenge. When we include measures of case quality, we see that higher quality cases increase the expected impact of derivative and contract litigation on firm value. We also develop evidence that tactics associated with multijurisdictional litigation are associated with a weakened impact of litigation on firm value. This evidence is consistent with the belief that the presence of litigation in another jurisdiction allows defense lawyers to bid down competing groups of plaintiffs’ lawyers during settlement negotiations. Finally, we show that abnormal returns are not associated with information on judicial assignment at the time of case filing, nor are they associated with judge identity at case resolution. These results suggest that the judicial impact on shareholder wealth at the time of judicial assignment and the time of case termination is too small to be statistically detected...|$|E
40|$|As the {{legislative}} {{body of the}} European Union (EU), the European Parliament (EP) comprises 732 elected representatives from over 150 national political parties from 25 member states. At the EP level, these members are affiliated with seven major party groups representing distinct policy positions. Here we provide precise estimates of these policy positions based on expert surveys, in addition to characterizing the dimensionality of policy competition in the EP. Our results suggest not only that party groups have identifiable and differentiated positions on multiple issues of policy, but also that these positions group broadly into two orthogonal dimensions: one consisting of classic left–right social and economic issues, and the other related to the powers and scope of EU institutions. KEY WORDS European Parliament expert surveys party competition policy positions Policy and Party Competition in the European Parliament Legislative activity and decision-making in the European Parliament (EP) is organized around political groups, partisan entities that perform most of the same functions at the transnational level as do parties in national parlia-ments. Political groups act as the gatekeepers to legislative amendments and the vast bulk of interruptive and <b>procedural</b> <b>motions</b> in the EP. In addition, political group size determines membership of committees and most other key parliamentary decision-making bodies. Despite the important role played by these groups in {{the functioning of the}} increasingly powerful EP, however, our understanding and knowledge of the policy space in which they compete remain rudimentary. This article addresses this gap in our knowledge by reporting the results of an expert survey of the policy posi-tions of the political groups in the EP...|$|E

This action was seen as controversial with many prominent Republican politicians, including Texas Senator Ted Cruz, speaking out against the punishment.|$|R
50|$|The {{legislation}} collapsed for {{a variety}} of reasons, {{not the least of which}} was the poor timing of debating a bill predicted to increase energy costs while much of the country is focused on $4-a-gallon gas. On top of that, a number of industrial state Democrats like Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio were uncomfortable with the strong emissions caps that would have created a new regime of regulations for coal, auto and other manufacturing industries. Republicans, for the most part, held firm against a bill they said would cost billions in regulations while pushing the cost of gas higher. Seven Republicans, mostly moderates, voted for the <b>procedural</b> <b>motion</b> on the legislation while four Democrats voted against it.|$|R
