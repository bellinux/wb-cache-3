However, some crabs walk forwards or backwards, including raninids, Libinia emarginata and Mictyris platycheles.

2500|$|Callinectes sapidus is a decapod crab of the {{swimming}} crab family <b>Portunidae.</b> The genus Callinectes is distinguished from other portunid crabs {{by the lack}} of an internal spine on the carpus (the middle segment of the claw), {{as well as by the}} T-shape of the male abdomen. Blue crabs may grow to a carapace width of [...] C.sapidus individuals exhibit sexual dimorphism. Males and females are easily distinguished by the shape of the abdomen (known as the [...] "apron") and by color differences in the chelipeds, or claws. The abdomen is long and slender in males, but wide and rounded in mature females. A popular mnemonic is that the male's apron is shaped like the Washington Monument, while the mature female's resembles the dome of the United States Capitol. Claw color differences are more subtle than apron shape. The immovable, fixed finger of the claws in males is blue with red tips, while females have orange coloration with purple tips. A female's abdomen changes as it matures: an immature female has a triangular-shaped abdomen, whereas a mature female's is rounded.|$|E
50|$|Matutidae is {{a family}} of crabs, {{sometimes}} called moon crabs, adapted for swimming or digging. They differ from the swimming crabs of the family <b>Portunidae</b> in that all five pairs of legs are flattened, rather than just the last pair, as in <b>Portunidae.</b> Crabs in the Matutidae are aggressive predators.|$|E

50|$|Leene {{was born}} in Amsterdam on 5 September 1906. She was educated in Amsterdam, going to Amsterdam University where she {{graduated}} in 1931 with a master's degree in zoology, specialising in comparative anatomy, studying the hearts of monitor lizards from the genus Varanus. She went on to study for a Ph.D. and she chose to study the taxonomy of crabs, probably {{under the influence of}} her teacher Professor J.E.W. Ihle who was working on the specimens collected by the Siboga expedition of 1899-1900. He allocated the swimming crabs, <b>Portunidae,</b> to Leene who attempted to write a monograph of the family and visited a number of museums in the Netherlands and abroad {{in the course of this}} work. Her thesis was published in 1930, proving to be a thorough treatment of the swimming crabs of the genus Charybdis and some other smaller genera of the family <b>Portunidae,</b> she hoped to complete a monograph of the family over subsequent years. Leene was awarded her doctoral degree cum laude on 22 June 1938 and her thesis is still considered as an important work for workers on the <b>Portunidae.</b>|$|E

50|$|Carcineretidae is a prehistoric {{family of}} heterotrematan crustaceans. They are only known from Cretaceous fossils.

50|$|The {{carapace}} of P. henslowii {{is almost}} circular, 48 mm wide and 40 mm long.

P. henslowii is red-brown on the upper surface, and paler beneath.|$|E
50|$|Ovalipes catharus, {{commonly}} known as paddle crab, is a species of crab of the family <b>Portunidae.</b> It is found around the coasts of New Zealand, the Chatham Islands, and in south-eastern parts of Australia.

50|$|The velvet crab (alternatively velvet {{swimming}} crab, devil crab or lady crab), Necora puber, is {{a species}} of crab. It is the largest swimming crab (family <b>Portunidae)</b> found in British coastal waters, with a carapace width of up to 100 mm, and the only species in the genus Necora.

This distinguishes it from other crabs {{in the family}} <b>Portunidae,</b> which often have elongated lateral spines. The carapace is yellow-grey or light purplish, with [...] "leopardlike clusters of purple dots", and 3-5 spines along the edge behind each eye. O. ovalipes is almost identical to O. floridanus, which lives in the Gulf of Mexico, but can {{be separated from the}} sympatric O. stephensoni by the purple spots, which O. stephensoni lacks.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Rocky shores {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} habitats of marine environment in coastal areas. This study was done in 2010 - 2011 to investigate the diversity of true crabs in intertidal rocky shores of Qeshm island.

Altogether, 15 crab species belonging to 8 families and 14 genus were identified. 4 species were from <b>Portunidae,</b> 3 species from Eriphiidae, 2 species from Majidae, 2 species from Grapsidae were identified. The others families including Euryplacidae, Leucociidae, Pilumnidae and Xanthidae families have the lowest species richness with only 1 species per family. <b>Portunidae</b> family with 4 species in intertidal zone had the highest species richness amongst studied stations. 3 species of Eriphia smithi from Eriphiidae family, Leptodius exaratus from Xanthidae family and Thalamita crenata from <b>Portunidae</b> family were present at all three intertidal zones (High tide, Mid tide and Low tide) ...|$|E
