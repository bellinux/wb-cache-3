40|$|Abstract Background The Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy (HSSS), which {{contains}} three phases, {{is widely used}} to identify Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) in MEDLINE. Lefebvre and Clarke suggest that reviewers might consider using four revisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HSSS. <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> {{this study is to}} validate these four revisions: combining the free text terms volunteer, crossover, versus, and the Medical Subject Heading CROSS-OVER STUDIES with <b>the</b> top two <b>phases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HSSS, respectively. Methods We replicated the subject search for 61 Cochrane reviews. <b>The</b> included studies <b>of</b> each review that were indexed in MEDLINE were pooled together by review and then combined with the subject search and each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four proposed search strategies, <b>the</b> top two <b>phases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HSSS, and all three <b>phases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HSSS. These retrievals were used to calculate the sensitivity and precision <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six search strategies for each review. Results Across the 61 reviews, the search term versus combined with <b>the</b> top two <b>phases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HSSS was able to find 3 more included studies than <b>the</b> top two <b>phases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HSSS alone, or in combination with any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other proposed search terms, but at <b>the</b> expense <b>of</b> missing 56 relevant articles that would be found if all three <b>phases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HSSS were used. The estimated time needed to finish a review is 1086 hours for all three <b>phases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HSSS, 823 hours for the strategy versus, 818 hours for <b>the</b> first two <b>phases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HSSS or any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other three proposed strategies. Conclusion This study shows that compared to <b>the</b> first two <b>phases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HSSS, adding the term versus to <b>the</b> top two <b>phases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HSSS balances the sensitivity and precision in the reviews studied here to some extent but the differences are very small. It is well known that missing relevant studies may result in bias in systematic reviews. Reviewers need to weigh the trade-offs when selecting the search strategies for identifying RCTs in MEDLINE. </p...|$|R

5|$|Aside from a {{tropical}} disturbance in August, the season began later than usual, the fourth consecutive season to do so. At {{the time it}} had the 4th latest start on record for the first named storm. Only about 20% of seasons have their first storm form after the middle of December, and the first named storm of this season, Ando, did not become {{a tropical}} storm until early January. However, January was active with three tropical cyclones, two of which became intense tropical cyclones, due to the active <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO). February returned to a period of inactivity, and generally there was minimal convection across the basin due to unusually dry air. This was spread by a powerful and persistent ridge that extended eastward from Madagascar, {{as well as an}} inactive <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MJO. Drought conditions occurred on Réunion {{due to the lack of}} rainfall. After three weeks of no tropical cyclones developing worldwide, an event unseen since 1995, the tropics became active again in early April.|$|E
