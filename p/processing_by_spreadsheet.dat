40|$|A special {{computer}} {{program has been}} developed, using QBASIC, to calculate numerically the thermodynamic changes of an ammonia-water vapor mixture along an isentropic expansion. The thermodynamic relations used were obtained {{in terms of the}} Gibbs' free energy equation for the gas phase of pure components and the entropy was held constant with an accuracy better than 0 · 000001 kJ/kg K. Results are in the form of tables allowing further <b>processing</b> <b>by</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> software such as Excel, Works or Lotus in order to obtain them in diagram form. Copyright © 1996.

To make up for this lapse in student outcomes, mathematics teachers should be among the most enthusiastic in seeking to maximize technologies’ potential to develop student understanding, stimulate student interest, and increase student mathematics proficiency. In this study, pre-service mathematics teachers worked in teams to develop their knowledge and skills in designing activity-based lessons supported <b>by</b> <b>spreadsheets.</b> The pre-service teachers developed and demonstrated their knowledge and skill adequately during the design and enactment of their lessons. The results also showed that, the activity-based lessons supported <b>by</b> <b>spreadsheets</b> served a useful pedagogical approach, impacted on student learning outcomes and has the potential of improving teaching and learning mathematics in secondary educatio...|$|R

Importance of crisis management in power distribution network is investigated from various aspects. Reductions in off times and immediate returns of power, as well as undistributed energy along subscribers` satisfaction are parameters considered in crisis management power distribution network. This paper solves a case about this issue <b>by</b> <b>spreadsheets</b> in order to provide a new model for decision makers to facilitate solving these kinds of problems...|$|R

In recent years software solutions {{have been developed to}} bring a level of process automation, standardization and enhanced control to the balance sheet substantiation or account certification process. These solutions are suitable for organizations with a high volume of accounts and/or personnel involved in the Balance Sheet Substantiation process and can be used to drive efficiencies, improve transparency and help to reduce risk.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} {{that the use of}} spreadsheets for teaching students about LP modelling can be further enhanced by supplying students with a suitable template at the introductory stage. With a rearrangement of the layout, which corresponds to a standard pedagogic approach, it is possible to create a template, with locked formulae, which is easy to use and flexible enough to handle problems of different sizes. Such a template would help students concentrate on LP modelling concepts rather than being distracted <b>by</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> errors.
