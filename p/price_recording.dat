50|$|Du Plessis {{describes}} the historical {{development of these}} charts from a <b>price</b> <b>recording</b> system to a charting method. Traders kept track of prices by writing them down in columns. They noticed patterns in their price record and started referring to them first as ‘fluctuation charts’ and then as ‘figure charts’. They started using Xs instead of numbers and these charts became known as ‘point charts’. Traders used both point charts and figure charts together and referred to them as their point and figure charts, which is where Du Plessis suggests the name point and figure came from. Modern point and figure charts are drawn with Xs and Os where columns of Xs are rising prices and columns of Os are falling prices, although many traditionalists such as David Fuller and Louise Yamada still use the Xs only point method of plotting.|$|E
40|$|This Alongside {{the market}} {{participants}} who calculate the market impact on international events {{as well as}} domestic events, <b>price</b> <b>recording</b> has also become crucial for market participants involved in the agricultural policy. Due to large variation in the commodity prices, many around the globe are busy in evaluating the best procedure for its forecasting. This paper demonstrates the techniques that predict the market prices of grains using ARMA and wavelet transformation. A monthly data from July 1983 to July 2013, with 300 observations have been used. After checking the precision of these models {{with the help of}} three different error tests, it turns out, that wavelet forecasting method is best for grain market prices...|$|E

30|$|In this study, we {{were able}} to get 475 companies’ stock <b>price</b> <b>records</b> out of 504 companies. It might be {{possible}} to improve the performance of the models if we have the <b>price</b> <b>records</b> for all the companies. Another improvement can be achieved by using finer data such as a half minute interval <b>price</b> <b>records</b> or even finer than a half minute. If we use finer data sets, we might be able to improve the model for forecasting one hour future, and also able to forecast nearer future such as 30 -min future or 15 -min future.|$|R

40|$|A simple {{quantitative}} {{measure of}} the self-similarity in time-series in general and {{in the stock market}} in particular is the scaling behavior of the absolute size of the jumps across lags of size k. A stronger form of self-similarity entails not only that this mean absolute value, but also the full distributions of lag-k jumps have a scaling behavior characterized by the above Hurst exponent. In 1963 Benoit Mandelbrot showed that cotton prices have such a strong form of (distributional) self-similarity, {{and for the first time}} introduced Levy's stable random variables in the modeling of <b>price</b> <b>records.</b> This paper discusses the analysis of the self-similarity of high-frequency DEM-USD exchange rate records and the 30 main German stock <b>price</b> <b>records.</b> Distributional selfsimilarity is found in both cases and some of its consequences are discussed. 1 Introduction Self-similarity[1] in financial <b>price</b> <b>records</b> manifests itself in the virtual impossibility to distinguish a daily <b>price</b> <b>record</b> fro [...] ...|$|R
