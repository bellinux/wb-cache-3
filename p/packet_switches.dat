50|$|<b>Packet</b> <b>switching</b> may be {{classified}} into connectionless <b>packet</b> <b>switching,</b> {{also known as}} datagram <b>switching,</b> and connection-oriented <b>packet</b> <b>switching,</b> also known as virtual circuit switching.|$|R
50|$|X.25 is {{a notable}} use of <b>packet</b> <b>switching</b> in that, despite being based on <b>packet</b> <b>switching</b> methods, it {{provided}} virtual circuits to the user. These virtual circuits carry variable-length packets. In 1978, X.25 provided {{the first international}} and commercial <b>packet</b> <b>switching</b> network, the International <b>Packet</b> <b>Switched</b> Service (IPSS). Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) also is a virtual circuit technology, which uses fixed-length cell relay connection oriented <b>packet</b> <b>switching.</b>|$|R

A {{key component}} is an all-optical <b>packet</b> <b>switch.</b> We discus a 1 x 2 all-optical <b>packet</b> <b>switch,</b> {{in which the}} headers are processed by using a SLALOM structure, and the header information is stored by using an all-optical flip-flop memory...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{important}} to realize that while DCS devices [...] "switch" [...] traffic, they are not <b>packet</b> <b>switches</b> - they switch circuits, not packets, and the circuit arrangements they are used to manage tend to persist over very long time spans, typically months or longer, as compared to <b>packet</b> <b>switches,</b> which can route every packet differently, and operate on micro- or millisecond time spans.|$|E
50|$|Later on BT used Telematics <b>packet</b> <b>switches</b> for the Vascom {{network to}} support the Prestel service and also bought the Tymnet network from McDonneld Douglas.|$|E

50|$|In telecommunications, fast <b>packet</b> <b>switching</b> is {{a variant}} of <b>packet</b> <b>switching</b> that {{increases}} the throughput by eliminating overhead associated with flow control and error correction functions, which are either offloaded to upper layer networking protocols or removed altogether. ATM and Frame Relay are two major implementations of fast <b>packet</b> <b>switching.</b>|$|R
50|$|BT's {{attitude}} to <b>packet</b> <b>switching</b> was ambivalent at best. Compared to France's Transpac {{that had a}} separate commercial company with dedicated management and saw X.25 <b>packet</b> <b>switching</b> as a core offering BT's then senior management regarded <b>packet</b> <b>switching</b> as a passing phase until the telecommunications nirvana of ISDN's 64 kbit/s for everyone arrived.|$|R

50|$|The most {{important}} legacy of CYCLADES was in showing that moving {{the responsibility for}} reliability into the hosts was workable, and produced a well-functioning service network.

50|$|Unlike 3G, {{which is}} based on two {{parallel}} infrastructures consisting of circuit <b>switched</b> and <b>packet</b> <b>switched</b> network nodes, 4G will be based on <b>packet</b> <b>switching</b> only. This will require low-latency data transmission.|$|R

50|$|Circuit <b>switching</b> {{contrasts}} with <b>packet</b> <b>switching</b> which divides {{the data to}} be transmitted into small units, called packets, transmitted through the network independently. <b>Packet</b> <b>switching</b> shares available network bandwidth between multiple communication sessions.|$|R
50|$|CYCLADES used a layered architecture, {{as did the}} Internet. The basic packet {{transmission}} like function, named CIGALE, was novel; however, it provided an unreliable datagram service (the word was coined by Louis Pouzin by combining data and telegram). Since the <b>packet</b> <b>switches</b> {{no longer had to}} ensure correct delivery of data, this greatly simplified their design.|$|E
50|$|Design and {{staffing}} started in 1972, and November 1973 {{saw the first}} demonstration, using three hosts and one packet switch. Deployment continued in 1974, with three <b>packet</b> <b>switches</b> installed by February, although {{at that point the}} network was only operational for three hours each day. By June the network was up to seven switches, and was available throughout the day for experimental use.|$|E
50|$|The {{network was}} {{initially}} {{based upon a}} dedicated modular packet switch using DCC's TP 4000 communication processor hardware. The operating system and the packet switching software was developed by Telenet (later on GTE Telenet). At the time of PSS's launch this was in advance of both Telenet's own network and most others that used general purpose mini-computers as <b>packet</b> <b>switches.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Circuit {{switched}} NoC has, {{compared to}} <b>packet</b> <b>switching,</b> a longer setup time, guaranteed throughput and latency, higher clock frequency, lower HW complexity, and higher energy efficiency. Depending on packet size and throughput requirements they exhibit {{better or worse}} performance. In this paper we designed a circuit switched NoC and compared that with <b>packet</b> <b>switched</b> NoC. By speculation and analysis, we propose that, as packet size increases, performance decreases for <b>packet</b> <b>switched</b> NoC, while it increases for circuit switched NoC. By close examination on the router architecture, we suggest that circuit switched NoC can operate at a higher clock frequency than <b>packet</b> <b>switched</b> NoC, and thus at zero load above a certain <b>packet</b> size circuit <b>switched</b> NoC could be bette...|$|R

50|$|Ascend Communications also {{acquired}} several companies. The {{most notable}} {{of these was}} Cascade Communications, which Ascend acquired in 1997. Cascade designed and manufactured high density carrier <b>packet</b> <b>switches,</b> including the B-STDX9000 frame relay switch and the CBX-500 and GX-550 ATM switches. The B-STDX and CBX/GX lines were the workhorses of most RBOC Frame Relay and ATM networks throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century.|$|E
50|$|Most packet {{switched}} networks use store-and-forward transmission at {{the input of}} the link. A switch using store-and-forward transmission will receive (save) the entire packet to the buffer and check it for CRC errors or other problems before sending the first bit of the packet into the outbound link. Thus, store-and-forward <b>packet</b> <b>switches</b> introduce a store-and-forward delay at the input to each link along the packet's route.|$|E
50|$|Packet mode {{communication}} may {{be implemented}} {{with or without}} intermediate forwarding nodes (<b>packet</b> <b>switches</b> or routers). Packets are normally forwarded by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in, first-out buffering, but may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing, traffic shaping, or for differentiated or guaranteed quality of service, such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket. In case of a shared physical medium (such as radio or 10BASE5), the packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Internet traffic loads are increasing. Sustaining <b>packet</b> <b>switching</b> {{throughput}} of a core node will be difficult. A {{major reason}} for this is power consumption and packaging volume. As long as we use only current semiconductor technology, the switching capacity will be limited. Rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) superconducting technology can overcome such difficulties because of high-speed operation and low-power consumption characteristics. A superconducting wiring also enables high-speed inter-chip communication. We report on progress on <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> circuit implementation and cryo-cooled packaging for a RSFQ <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> system. In addition, we discuss a possible <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> architecture over 100 Tbps that uses RSFQ technology...|$|R
40|$|In {{designing}} a satellite system with on-board processing, {{the selection of}} a switching architecture is often critical. The on-board switching function can be implemented by circuit <b>switching</b> or <b>packet</b> <b>switching.</b> Destination-directed <b>packet</b> <b>switching</b> has several attractive features, such as self-routing without on-board switch reconfiguration, no switch control memory requirement, efficient bandwidth utilization for <b>packet</b> <b>switched</b> traffic, and accommodation of circuit <b>switched</b> traffic. Destination-directed <b>packet</b> <b>switching,</b> however, has two potential concerns: (1) contention and (2) congestion. And this report specifically deals with the first problem. It includes a description and analysis of various self-routing switch structures, the nature of contention problems, and contention and resolution techniques...|$|R

50|$|When Inmos {{was formed}} in 1978, May joined to work on {{microcomputer}} architecture, becoming lead architect of the transputer and designer of the associated programming language Occam.

The prototype of the transputer was called the Simple 42 and was completed in 1982. The first production transputers, the T212 and T414, followed in 1985; the T800 floating point transputer in 1987. May initiated the design of one of the first VLSI <b>packet</b> <b>switches,</b> the C104, together with the communications system of the T9000 transputer.|$|E
50|$|As the {{locomotive}} proceeds down the track, the on-board systems communicate via radio to the trackside BCMs in the region, requesting any temporary speed restrictions {{for the next}} three or more regions of the track, ensuring that {{the locomotive}}'s database is always kept current with any possible temporary restrictions issued by the train dispatcher. Wayside Communications Managers (WCM) (or <b>packet</b> <b>switches)</b> link all the BCMs in the region to a backhaul network which allows them to communicate with the dispatcher's office and associated control systems via TCP/IP. This design provides locomotives with information about speed restrictions as soon as they go into effect without having to rely on voice communications with the train crew.|$|E
50|$|In data communication, a {{physical}} network node may either be data communication equipment (DCE) {{such as a}} modem, hub, bridge or switch; or data terminal equipment (DTE) such as a digital telephone handset, a printer or a host computer. If the network in question is a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), every LAN or WAN node (that are at least data link layer devices) must have a network address, typically one for each network interface controller it possesses. Examples are computers, <b>packet</b> <b>switches,</b> xDSL modems (with Ethernet interface) and wireless LAN access points. Note that a hub constitutes {{a physical}} network node, but does not constitute a LAN network node, since a hubbed network logically is a bus network. Analogously, a repeater or PSTN modem (with serial interface) is a physical network node but not a LAN node in this sense.|$|E

40|$|This work {{analyzes}} {{whether a}} parallel <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> (PPS) can emulate an output-queued (OQ) <b>packet</b> <b>switch.</b> The class of PPS {{is characterized by}} the deployment of parallel low-speed switches. Each lower speed <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> operates at {{only a fraction of the}} input line rate R. This study develops and investigates a PPS which distributes cells to low-speed switches and uses outputs with push-in arbitrary-out (PIAO) queues. We present a novel Markov chain model that successfully exhibits these performance characteristics. The simulation results demonstrate that the developed Markov chain model is accurate for practical network loads. The major findings, obtained using the proposed model, are that: (1) the throughput and cell drop rates of a PPS can theoretically emulate those of an OQ <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> as indicated in Eq. (49); and (2) the cell delay of a PPS can theoretically emulate that of an OQ <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> as given by Eq. (51) ...|$|R
