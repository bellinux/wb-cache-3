The merit {{of this kind of}} yoke cutting of this kind is that {{it is much easier to}} control the mechanical accuracy. This cutting of the core of this yoke would create an asymmetric magnetic circuit that would induce some forbidden field. The fundamental field strength would also be less than the other sextupole magnet with the same <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>group</b> in the storage ring. Those problems all come from the saturation effect in the york cutting side of magnet. Therefore there is an extra magnetic circuit across the cutting of the yoke from the two adjacent poles to compensate less core area of the yoke. This magnetic circuit can solve the saturation effect field. The field measurement for varied excitation current in these three magnetic circuits have been done to verify that the explanation of the phenomena is correct. 1...|$|E

Power Supply checkouts are now accomplished in a time-frame of hours rather than days, reducing the number of person-hours needed to accomplish the checkout and making the system available more quickly for beam development.

The Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) magnets are controlled by 100 's of varying types of power supplies. There is a concentrated effort to perform routine maintenance on the supplies during shutdown periods. There is an effort at RHIC to streamline the time needed for system checkout in order to quickly arrive at a period of beam operations for RHIC. This time-critical period is when the checkout of the power supplies is performed as the RHIC ring becomes cold and the supplies are connected to their physical magnets.

50|$|A {{switched-mode}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (switching-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switch-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switched <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> SMPS, or switcher) is {{an electronic}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently. Like other <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source (often mains power) to DC loads, {{such as a}} personal computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. Ideally, a switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> dissipates no <b>power.</b> Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time. In contrast, a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor. This higher power conversion efficiency is an important advantage of a switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> Switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> may also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply due to the smaller transformer size and weight.|$|R
