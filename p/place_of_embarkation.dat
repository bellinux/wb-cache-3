40|$|The Mediterranean Sea is {{the most}} porous border between Europe and its {{neighbours}} and the world's most dangerous border between countries that are not at war with each other. Three facts emerge: sea routes to Europe are anything but new; <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> and disembarkation have changed in relation to controls; {{and the risk of}} dying at sea has considerably increased over the last decade. Two key questions for designing responses must be addressed: to what extent do the root causes of clandestine migration across the Mediterranean lie in the Mediterranean region itself; and how many in these flows are irregular labour migrants and how many are refugees? The Mare Nostrum operation launched by Italy will be discussed in terms of: rescues; compliance with European legislation; and possible pull effects on unauthorised migration. In conclusion, other possible responses will be brought up such as combatting the smugglers and pre-voyage intervention.

[...] If to this notice be added the year 1826, you have the very hour and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> our <b>embarkation.</b> We were nominally of the London party, it being our intention, however, to land at Cowes, from which place we proposed crossing the Channel to Havre. The reason for making this variation from the direct route, was the superior comfort of the London ship; that of the French line for the 1st June, though a good vessel and well commanded, being actually the least commodious packet that plied between the two hemispheres.|$|R
60|$|These {{things being}} all thus arranged, Philip {{began to make}} his {{preparations}} openly for embarking on his voyage home. The knights and barons, and indeed the whole body of the army, considered Philip's leaving them as a very culpable abandonment of the enterprise, and they crowded around the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> when he went on board his vessel, and manifested their displeasure with ill-suppressed hisses and groans.|$|E

60|$|Farther on {{he passed}} beneath {{the tower of}} the Old South.

They were proceeding to the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation.</b>|$|E
60|$|They now again {{entered the}} gorge of the cavern, and {{stepping}} into the boat, the Highlander pushed off, and, {{taking advantage of the}} morning breeze, hoisted a clumsy sort of sail, while Evan assumed the helm, directing their course, as it appeared to Waverley, rather higher up the lake than towards the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> his <b>embarkation</b> on the preceding night. As they glided along the silver mirror, Evan opened the conversation with a panegyric upon Alice, who, he said, was both CANNY and FENDY; and was, to the boot of all that, the best dancer of a strathspey in the whole strath. Edward assented to her praises so far as he understood them, yet could not help regretting that she was condemned to such a perilous and dismal life.|$|R
25|$|Two ports <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> were {{established}} with commanders appointed 17 July 1917, one at New York with headquarters at Hoboken and the second, then officially the Newport News Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation,</b> in Hampton Roads with headquarters at Newport News. While 88% of troops, 1,656,000 from New York itself and 142,000 from its sub-ports, sent overseas transited through the New York Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation,</b> 288,000 transited through the Newport News Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation.</b>|$|R

Until June 1942 Hampton Roads was a sub-port of the New York Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation.</b>|$|R
60|$|We left London {{with nothing}} but our clothes, our wrappers, some tobacco, some French novels, and some Egyptian cigars. Everything {{that was to be}} bought for the voyage was to be {{procured}} at Bristol. Everything that could be extracted from private benevolence, was to be taken in unlimited quantities from hospitable friends living more or less in the neighbourhood of our <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation.</b> At Bristol we plunged over head and ears in naval business immediately. After ordering a ham, and a tongue, marmalade, lemons, anchovy paste, and general groceries, we set forth to the quay to equip ourselves and our vessel.|$|E
60|$|The {{preparations}} {{which were}} required for Margaret and her company {{to return to}} England in suitable state seem to have consumed several months; for, although it was as early as November that the great entrance into Paris took place, and the news of Henry's restoration was received, {{it was not until}} February that the royal party were ready to embark. There were negotiations to be made, and men to be enlisted, and ships to be procured, and funds to be provided, and appointments to be decided upon, and dresses to be made, and a thousand questions of precedence and etiquette to be considered and arranged. At length, however, all was ready, and the whole company proceeded together to the port which had been selected as the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation.</b> This port was Harfleur. Harfleur is situated on the coast of Normandy, near the more modern port of Havre.|$|E
60|$|Never did retreat require greater {{secrecy and}} circumspection. Nine {{thousand}} men, {{with all the}} munitions of war, were to be withdrawn from before a victorious army, encamped so near that every stroke of spade and pickaxe from their trenches could be heard. The retreating troops, moreover, were to be embarked and conveyed across a strait three-quarters of a mile wide, swept by rapid tides. The least alarm of their movement would bring the enemy upon them, and produce a terrible scene of confusion and carnage at the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation.</b> Washington made the preparatory arrangements with great alertness, yet profound secrecy. Verbal orders were sent to Colonel Hughes, who acted as quartermaster-general, to impress all water craft, largo and small, from Spyt den Duivel on the Hudson round to Hell Gate on the Sound, and have them {{on the east side}} of the city by evening. The order was issued at noon, and so promptly executed that, although some of the vessels had to be brought a distance of fifteen miles, they were all at Brooklyn at eight o'clock in the evening, and put under the management of Colonel Glover's amphibious Marblehead regiment.|$|E
50|$|The New York Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> {{continued}} operations {{under the}} Chief of Transportation with the Hampton Roads Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> becoming a sub-port effective 31 March 1954. On 28 September 1955 the New York Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> was redesignated effective 1 October as the Atlantic Transportation Terminal Command, Brooklyn, headquartered in the Brooklyn Army Base {{with responsibility for}} operation of all Army terminal and related activities of the Atlantic coast from those in Canada south to Miami, Florida. By the same order the other Ports <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> and sub-ports were redesignated. The Brooklyn Army Base, a class III sub-installation of the New York Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> was separated and designated the Brooklyn Army Terminal. Effective 1 April 1965 the remaining Army facility of the NYPOE, the Brooklyn Army Terminal, along with other such remnant facilities of the old ports <b>of</b> <b>embarkation,</b> were transferred from the Army Material Command to the Military Traffic Management and Terminal Service.|$|R
50|$|In World War II the NYPOE, {{now under}} the new Transportation Corps, was the largest of eight Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> commands, the second largest being the San Francisco Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> and the second largest on the East Coast being Hampton Roads Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation.</b> Originally it had the army {{facilities}} in Charleston, South Carolina as a sub-port until it was elevated to the Charleston Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> as a separate command. The cargo sub-port at Philadelphia remained {{under the command of}} NYPOE throughout the war. By {{the end of the war}} 3,172,778 passengers, counting 475 embarked at the Philadelphia cargo port, and 37,799,955 measurement tons of cargo had passed through the New York port itself with 5,893,199 tons of cargo having passed through its cargo sub-port at Philadelphia—about 44% of all troops and 34% of all cargo passing through army ports <b>of</b> <b>embarkation.</b>|$|R
50|$|The New York Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> (NYPOE) was a United States Army command {{responsible}} for the movement of troops and supplies from the United States to overseas commands. The command had facilities in New York, New Jersey, roughly covering the extent of today's Port of New York and New Jersey, as well as ports in other cities as sub-ports under its direct command. During World War I, when it was originally known as the Hoboken Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> with headquarters in seized Hamburg America Line facilities in Hoboken, New Jersey, the Quartermaster Corps had responsibility. The sub-ports were at Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia and the Canadian ports of Halifax, Montreal and St. Johns. The World War I port <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> was disestablished, seized and requisitioned facilities returned or sold and operations consolidated at the new army terminal in Brooklyn. Between the wars reduced operations continued the core concepts of a port <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> and as the home port of Atlantic army ships. With war in Europe the army revived the formal New York Port <b>of</b> <b>Embarkation</b> command with the New York port, the only Atlantic port <b>of</b> <b>embarkation,</b> taking a lead in developing concepts for operations.|$|R
60|$|It {{might have}} been {{by means of a}} secret sympathy, or it was {{possibly}} the result of accident, but certain it is, that the Chippewa was placed in that of le Bourdon. As for Whiskey Centre, he lay like a log in the bottom of his own light bark, cared for only by his affectionate wife, who had made a pillow for his head; but, fortunately, if no assistance just then, not any material hindrance to the movements of his friends. By the time le Bourdon and the Chippewa had got their stations, and the canoes were free of the bottom, it was evident by the sounds, that not only the dogs, but divers of their masters, had floundered through the swamp, and were already on the firm ground east of it. As the dogs ran by scent, little doubt remained of their soon leading the savages to the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation.</b> Aware of this, the bee-hunter directed the Chippewa to follow, and urged his own canoe away from the shore, following one of three of the natural channels that united just at that point.|$|E
60|$|The party under Captain Lawton {{had watched}} the {{retiring}} foe to his boats with the most unremitting vigilance, without finding any fit opening for a charge. The experienced successor of Colonel Wellmere knew too well {{the power of his}} enemy to leave the uneven surface of the heights, until compelled to descend {{to the level of the}} water. Before he attempted this hazardous movement, he threw his men into a compact square, with its outer edges bristling with bayonets. In this position, the impatient trooper well understood that brave men could never be assailed by cavalry with success, and he was reluctantly obliged to hover near them, without seeing any opportunity of stopping their slow but steady march to the beach. A small schooner, which had been their convoy from the city, lay with her guns bearing on the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation.</b> Against this combination of force and discipline, Lawton had sufficient prudence to see it would be folly to contend, and the English were suffered to embark without molestation. The dragoons lingered on the shore till the last moment, and then they reluctantly commenced their own retreat back to the main body of the corps.|$|E
6000|$|My plain tale draws {{towards a}} close. Sir George and I, in my {{character}} of his rejuvenated wife, displayed ourselves arm-in-arm among the negroes, and were cheered and followed to the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation.</b> There, Sir George, turning about, {{made a speech}} to his old companions, in which he thanked and bade them farewell with a very manly spirit; and {{towards the end of}} which he fell on some expressions which I still remember. [...] "If any of you gentry lose your money," [...] he said, [...] "take care you do not come to me; for in the first place, I shall do my best to have you murdered; and if that fails, I hand you over to the law. Blackmail won't do for me. I'll rather risk all upon a cast, than be pulled to pieces by degrees. I'll rather be found out and hang, than give a doit to one man-jack of you." [...] That same night we got under way and crossed to the port of New Orleans, whence, as a sacred trust, I sent the pocket-book to Mr. Caulder's son. In a week's time, the men were all paid off; new hands were shipped; and the Nemorosa weighed her anchor for Old England.|$|E

60|$|For {{the same}} reason I have said nothing here of the {{consolation}} that I found in Pesca's brotherly affection for me, when I saw him again after the sudden cessation of my residence at Limmeridge House. I have not recorded the fidelity with which my warm-hearted little friend followed me to the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> when I sailed for Central America, or the noisy transport of joy with which he received me when we next met in London. If I had felt justified in accepting the offers of service which he made to me on my return, he would have appeared again long ere this. But, though I knew that his honour and his courage were to be implicitly relied on, I was {{not so sure that}} his discretion was to be trusted, and, for that reason only, I followed the course of all my inquiries alone. It will now be sufficiently understood that Pesca was not separated from all connection with me and my interests, although he has hitherto been separated from all connection with the progress of this narrative. He was as true and as ready a friend of mine still as ever he had been in his life.|$|E
60|$|He {{filled the}} streets of the city with {{barricades}} and pitfalls, excepting two streets which led to the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation.</b> The object of these obstructions was to embarrass Caesar's progress through the city in case he should force an entrance while his men were getting on board the ships. He then, in order to divert Caesar's attention from his design, doubled the guards stationed upon the walls on the evening of his intended embarkation, and ordered them to make vigorous attacks upon all Caesar's forces outside. He then, when the darkness came on, marched his troops through the two streets which had been left open, to the landing place, and got them as fast as possible on board the transports. Some {{of the people of the}} town contrived to make known to Caesar's army what was going on, by means of signals from the walls; the army immediately brought scaling ladders in great numbers, and, mounting the walls with great ardor and impetuosity, they drove all before them, and soon broke open the gates and got possession of the city. But the barricades and pitfalls, together with the darkness, so embarrassed their movements, that Pompey succeeded in completing his embarkation and sailing away.|$|E
6000|$|We went {{straight}} to the lake, as it was called at Bly, and I daresay rightly called, though I reflect that it may in fact have been a sheet of water less remarkable than it appeared to my untraveled eyes. My acquaintance with sheets of water was small, and the pool of Bly, at all events on the few occasions of my consenting, under the protection of my pupils, to affront its surface in the old flat-bottomed boat moored there for our use, had impressed me both with its extent and its agitation. The usual <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> was half a mile from the house, but I had an intimate conviction that, wherever Flora might be, she was not near home. She had not given me the slip for any small adventure, and, since the day of the very great one that I had shared with her by the pond, I had been aware, in our walks, of the quarter to which she most inclined. This was why I had now given to Mrs. Grose's steps so marked a direction--a direction that made her, when she perceived it, oppose a resistance that showed me she was freshly mystified.

6000|$|... "Oh let me perish with you!" [...] Nick {{answered}} with a sigh. The boat had been hidden from them by the bole of a great tree which rose from the grass at the water's edge. It was moored to a small <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation</b> and was {{large enough to hold}} as many persons as were likely to wish to visit at once the little temple {{in the middle of the}} lake, which Nick liked because it was absurd and which Mrs. Dallow had never had a particular esteem for. The lake, fed by a natural spring, was a liberal sheet of water, measured by the scale of park scenery; and though its principal merit was that, taken at a distance, it gave a gleam of abstraction to the concrete verdure, doing the office of an open eye in a dull face, it could also be approached without derision on a sweet summer morning when it made a lapping sound and reflected candidly various things that were probably finer than itself--the sky, the great trees, the flight of birds. A man of taste, coming back from Rome a hundred years before, had caused a small ornamental structure to be raised, from artificial foundations, on its bosom, and had endeavoured to make this architectural pleasantry as nearly as possible a reminiscence of the small ruined rotunda which stands on the bank of the Tiber and is pronounced by ciceroni once sacred to Vesta. It was circular, roofed with old tiles, surrounded by white columns and considerably dilapidated. George Dallow had taken an interest in it--it reminded him not in the least of Rome, but of other things he liked--and had amused himself with restoring it. [...] "Give me your hand--sit there and I'll ferry you," [...] Nick said.|$|E
6000|$|... "The two inner coffins were {{carefully}} closed again; the old leaden coffin was strongly blocked up with wedges of wood, {{and both were}} once more soldered up with the most minute precautions, {{under the direction of}} Dr. Guillard. These different operations being terminated, the ebony sarcophagus was closed as well as its oak case. On delivering the key of the ebony sarcophagus to Count de Chabot, the King's Commissioner, Captain Alexander declared to him, {{in the name of the}} Governor, that this coffin, containing the mortal remains of the Emperor Napoleon, was considered as at the disposal of the French Government from that day, and from the moment at which it should arrive at the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>embarkation,</b> towards which it was about to be sent under the orders of General Middlemore. The King's Commissioner replied that he was charged by his Government, and in its name, to accept the coffin from the hands of the British authorities, and that he and the other persons composing the French mission were ready to follow it to James Town, where the Prince de Joinville, superior commandant of the expedition, would be ready to receive it and conduct it on board his frigate. A car drawn by four horses, decked with funereal emblems, had been prepared before the arrival of the expedition, to receive the coffin, as well as a pall, and all the other suitable trappings of mourning. When the sarcophagus was placed on the car, the whole was covered with a magnificent imperial mantle brought from Paris, the four corners of which were borne by Generals Bertrand and Gourgaud, Baron Las Cases and M. Marchand. At half-past three o'clock the funeral car began to move, preceded by a chorister bearing the cross, and by the Abbe Coquereau. M. de Chabot acted as chief mourner. All the authorities of the island, all the principal inhabitants, and the whole of the garrison, followed in procession from the tomb to the quay. But with the exception of the artillerymen necessary to lead the horses, and occasionally support the car when descending some steep parts of the way, the places nearest the coffin were reserved for the French mission. General Middlemore, although in a weak state of health, persisted in following the whole way on foot, together with General Churchill, chief of the staff in India, who had arrived only two days before from Bombay. The immense weight of the coffins, and the unevenness of the road, rendered the utmost carefulness necessary throughout the whole distance. Colonel Trelawney commanded in person the small detachment of artillerymen who conducted the car, and, thanks to his great care, not the slightest accident took place. From the moment of departure to the arrival at the quay, the cannons of the forts and the 'Belle Poule' fired minute-guns. After an hour's march the rain ceased for the first time since the commencement of the operations, and on arriving in sight of the town we found a brilliant sky and beautiful weather. From the morning the three French vessels of war had assumed the usual signs of deep mourning: their yards crossed and their flags lowered. Two French merchantmen, 'Bonne Amie' and 'Indien,' which had been in the roads for two days, had put themselves under the Prince's orders, and followed during the ceremony all the manoeuvers of the 'Belle Poule.' The forts of the town, and the houses of the consuls, had also their flags half-mast high.|$|E
