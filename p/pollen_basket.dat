5|$|While {{the vast}} {{majority}} of wasps play no role in pollination, a few species can effectively transport pollen and pollinate several plant species. Since wasps generally do not have a fur-like covering of soft hairs and a special body part for pollen storage (<b>Pollen</b> <b>basket)</b> as some bees do, pollen does not stick to them well. However {{it has been shown that}} even without hairs, several wasp species are able to effectively transport pollen, therefore contributing for potential pollination of several plant species.|$|E

It is challenging to distinguish between the over fifty Eufriesea species, particularly since the females mimic each other. Within the surinamensis group {{it is very difficult to}} distinguish between females of different species.|$|E

500|$|Bumblebees have round bodies {{covered in}} soft hair (long {{branched}} setae) called pile, making them appear and feel fuzzy. They have aposematic (warning) coloration, often consisting of contrasting bands of colour, and {{different species of}} bumblebee in a region often resemble each other in mutually protective MÃ¼llerian mimicry. Harmless insects such as hoverflies often derive protection from resembling bumblebees, in Batesian mimicry, and may be confused with them. [...] Nest-making bumblebees can be distinguished from similarly large, fuzzy cuckoo bees by {{the form of the}} female hind leg. In nesting bumblebees, it is modified to form a <b>pollen</b> <b>basket,</b> a bare shiny area surrounded by a fringe of hairs used to transport pollen, whereas in cuckoo bees, the hind leg is hairy all round, and pollen grains are wedged among the hairs for transport.|$|E

50|$|Bombus hyperboreus, a cuckoo bumblebee, {{is known}} to be a social {{parasite}} among the bumblebee family, mostly attacking and enslaving colonies of species of the same subgenus. Though it mostly usurps Bombus polaris, there have been evidence of B. hyperboreus usurping Bombus balteatus and Bombus jonellus as well. B. hyperboreus tends to usurp species in its subgenus. Most parasitic bumblebees depend on social bumblebees because they do not have <b>pollen</b> <b>baskets</b> and cannot produce their own wax. However, B. hyperboreus is different: although it is parasitic, it has <b>pollen</b> <b>baskets</b> and collects <b>pollen.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Bombus morio is a bumble bee, {{and thus}} shares certain {{features}} with other bumble bee species. They have three main body parts: head, thorax, and abdomen. The difference between {{female and male}} genders can be distinguished {{by the number of}} thorax segments. For the female, there are 6 segments, while the male holds 7 segments. Additionally, the males have 12 segments on their antenna, while the females have 13. The females also have <b>pollen</b> <b>baskets,</b> a rimmed segment with long hairs on their back legs, which are used to carry pollen back to the nest, while males do not have <b>pollen</b> <b>baskets.</b>|$|R

50|$|The cuckoo bee {{has many}} {{physical}} differences from ordinary bumblebees. Cuckoo female bees {{do not have}} <b>pollen</b> <b>baskets</b> on their rear legs. Most cuckoo bumblebees also do not produce wax from between their abdominal segments, although {{there is evidence that}} the Bombus sylvestris bumblebee secretes wax.|$|R
50|$|The Bombus sylvestris cuckoo female bee cannot collect pollen for her nest {{because it}} lacks corbicula, which are <b>pollen</b> <b>baskets</b> found on {{bumblebees}} on the hind legs. However, the Forest cuckoo bee does eat pollen like regular social bumblebees because the pollen helps in ovary maturation in fertilized females.|$|R
5000|$|Osmia cornuta, the European orchard bee, is {{a species}} of bee in the genus Osmia found in {{southern}} and central Europe, north to Belgium, and the southern parts of the Netherlands. The first record of this bee in Great Britain occurred in 2017. [...] They are of the solitary type; they {{do not live in}} colonies in hives like bumble bees and honey bees. They lack the <b>pollen</b> <b>baskets</b> on their hind tibiae; they do not produce honey, but they do use the pollen and nectar to stock their nests when they are ready.|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} animal-pollinated {{flowers were}} shallow, cup-shaped blooms pollinated by insects such as beetles, so the syndrome of insect pollination was well established {{before the first}} appearance of bees. The novelty is that bees are specialized as pollination agents, with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination, and are the most efficient pollinating insects. In a process of coevolution, flowers developed floral rewards such as nectar and longer tubes, and bees developed longer tongues to extract the nectar. Bees also developed structures known as scopal hairs and <b>pollen</b> <b>baskets</b> to collect and carry pollen. The location and type differ among and between groups of bees. Most bees have scopal hairs located on their hind legs or {{on the underside of}} their abdomens, some bees in the family Apidae possess <b>pollen</b> <b>baskets</b> on their hind legs while very few species lack these entirely and instead collect pollen in their crops. This drove the adaptive radiation of the angiosperms, and, in turn, the bees themselves. Bees have not only coevolved with flowers but it is believed that some bees have coevolved with mites. Some bees provide tufts of hairs called acarinaria that appear to provide lodgings for mites; in return, it is believed that the mites eat fungi that attack pollen, so the relationship in this case may be mutualistc.|$|R
5|$|The thorax {{has three}} segments, {{each with a}} pair of robust legs, and a pair of {{membranous}} wings on the hind two segments. The front legs of corbiculate bees bear combs for cleaning the antennae, and in many species the hind legs bear <b>pollen</b> <b>baskets,</b> flattened sections with incurving hairs to secure the collected pollen. The wings are synchronised in flight and the somewhat smaller hind wings connect to the forewings by a row of hooks along their margin which connect to a groove in the forewing. The abdomen has nine segments, the hindermost three being modified into the sting.|$|R
25|$|Bees collect pollen {{in their}} <b>pollen</b> <b>baskets</b> {{and carry it}} back to the hive. In the hive, pollen is used as a protein source {{necessary}} during brood-rearing. In certain environments, excess pollen can be collected from the hives of A. mellifera and A. cerana. It is often eaten as a health supplement. It also has been used with moderate success as a source of pollen for hand pollination. However, pollen collected by bees and harvested for pollination must be used within a few hours because it loses its potency rapidly, possibly because of the effects of enzymes or other chemicals from the bees.|$|R
50|$|Bombus vosnesenskii has {{a number}} of {{distinctive}} features. These include short, even hair, the rounded angle of the basitarsus, which is the middle leg, and a square face. Additionally, the fringed hair of its hind legs forms the corbicula, or <b>pollen</b> <b>basket.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>pollen</b> <b>basket</b> or {{corbicula}} (plural corbiculae) {{is part of}} the tibia on the {{hind legs}} of certain species of bees. They use the structure in harvesting pollen and returning it to the nest or hive. Other species of bee have scopae instead.|$|E
50|$|The adults {{grow up to}} 13 - 16 mm long. They have a black-brown {{body with}} sparse light hair, while {{the first and the}} second {{abdominal}} segment are reddish. The females have a <b>pollen</b> <b>basket</b> of curved hairs {{on the sides of the}} thorax.|$|E

5|$|Brood parasites {{occur in}} several bee {{families}} including the apid subfamily Nomadinae. Females of these bees lack pollen collecting structures (the scopa) {{and do not}} construct their own nests. They typically enter the nests of pollen collecting species, and lay their eggs in cells provisioned by the host bee. When the cuckoo bee larva hatches it consumes the host larva's pollen ball, and often the host egg also. The Arctic bee species, Bombus hyperboreus, in particular are an aggressive species that attack and enslave other bees of the same subgenus. However, unlike many other bee brood parasites, they have <b>pollen</b> <b>baskets</b> and often collect pollen.|$|R
5|$|Pollen {{is removed}} from flowers {{deliberately}} or incidentally by bumblebees. Incidental removal occurs when bumblebees {{come in contact with}} the anthers of a flower while collecting nectar. When it enters a flower, the bumblebee's body hairs receive a dusting of pollen from the anthers. In queens and workers this is then groomed into the corbiculae (<b>pollen</b> <b>baskets)</b> on the hind legs where it can be seen as bulging masses that may contain as many as a million pollen grains. Male bumblebees do not have corbiculae and do not purposively collect pollen. Bumblebees are also capable of buzz pollination, in which they dislodge pollen from the anthers by creating a resonant vibration with their flight muscles.|$|R

50|$|The Trachusa perdita bee is dark grey {{with white}} bands of hairs on its abdomen. Its <b>pollen</b> <b>basket</b> is located under its abdomen, and the bee grows from {{one-half}} inch to three-eighths of an inch.

5000|$|The Apinae are the {{subfamily}} {{that includes}} the majority of bees in the family Apidae. It includes the familiar [...] "corbiculate" [...] (<b>pollen</b> <b>basket)</b> bees â bumblebees, honey bees, orchid bees, stingless bees, and the extinct genus Euglossopteryx. It also includes {{all but two of}} the groups (excluding Nomadinae and Xylocopinae) that were previously classified in the family Anthophoridae.|$|E
50|$|Entomophily or insect {{pollination}} {{is a form}} of pollination whereby pollen of plants, especially but not only of flowering plants, is distributed by insects. Flowers pollinated by insects typically advertise themselves with bright colours, sometimes with conspicuous patterns (honey guides) leading to rewards of pollen and nectar; they may also have an attractive scent which in some cases mimics insect pheromones. Insect pollinators such as bees have adaptations for their role, such as lapping or sucking mouthparts to take in nectar, and in some species also <b>pollen</b> <b>baskets</b> on their hind legs. This required the coevolution of insects and flowering plants in the development of pollination behaviour by the insects and pollination mechanisms by the flowers, benefiting both groups.|$|R

Pollen carried on their bodies may be carried to another flower where a small portion can rub off onto the pistil, resulting in cross pollination. Almost all of civilization's food supply (maize is a noteworthy exception) depends greatly on crop pollination by honey bees, whether directly eaten or used as forage crops for animals that produce milk and meat. Nectar is sucked up through the proboscis, mixed with enzymes in the stomach, and carried back to the hive, where it is stored in wax cells and evaporated into honey.|$|R
