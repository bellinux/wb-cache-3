25|$|In the 1960s <b>pipelining</b> {{was viewed}} as an innovation, and by the 1970s the use of vector {{processors}} had been well established. By the 1980s, many supercomputers used parallel vector processors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pipelining</b> {{means that}} the chip can accept a new command before it has {{finished}} processing the previous one. For a pipelined write, the write command can be immediately followed by another command without waiting for the data {{to be written into}} the memory array. For a pipelined read, the requested data appears a fixed number of clock cycles (latency) after the read command, during which additional commands can be sent.|$|E

This version introduced HTTP <b>pipelining</b> as a test feature to increase web page load speed, starting with build 106364.

Other work included being able to move profile icons directly to the desktop in Windows.|$|E
25|$|AMD {{designed}} the CPU with more robust x86 instruction decoding capabilities {{than that of}} K6, to enhance its ability to keep more data in-flight at once. The Athlon's three decoders could potentially decode three x86 instructions to six microinstructions per clock, although this was somewhat unlikely in real-world use. The critical branch predictor unit, essential to keeping the pipeline busy, was enhanced compared to what was on board the K6. Deeper <b>pipelining</b> with more stages allowed higher clock speeds to be attained. Whereas the AMD K6-III+ topped out at 570MHz due to its short pipeline, even when built on the 180nm process, the Athlon was capable of clocking much higher.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{agreement}} {{of a system}} design, RTL designers then implement the functional models in a hardware description language like Verilog, SystemVerilog, or VHDL. Using digital design components like adders, shifters, and state machines as well as computer architecture concepts like <b>pipelining,</b> superscalar execution, and branch prediction, RTL designers will break a functional description into hardware models of components on the chip working together. Each of the simple statements described in the system design can easily turn into thousands of lines of RTL code, {{which is why it}} is extremely difficult to verify that the RTL will do the right thing in all the possible cases that the user may throw at it.|$|E
30|$|From recent stress {{analysis}} research, {{it can be}} seen: (1) there is few stress study on tunnel <b>pipeline.</b> (2) study on tunnel <b>pipeline</b> mainly focuses on gas <b>pipeline.</b> However, parallel <b>pipelines</b> (gas <b>pipeline</b> and oil <b>pipeline)</b> are much more common, but there are few researches on tunnel <b>pipeline</b> stress, resulting in the lack of comprehensive consideration of tunnel <b>pipeline</b> design. (3) Previous study of the tunnel <b>pipeline</b> was confined to conventional working condition. (4) <b>Pipeline</b> {{stress analysis}} technology is {{in the development of}} the static to dynamic, while present dynamic study was confined in ordinary buried <b>pipelines,</b> and there is little study on tunnel <b>pipeline.</b> (5) The difference between tunnel <b>pipeline</b> and buried <b>pipeline</b> is that displacement check for tunnel <b>pipeline</b> is as important as meeting stress requirements. However, the previous research did few analyses on <b>pipeline</b> displacement.|$|R

25|$|The {{electronic}} device performing the computations is synced with a clock that is running at frequencies {{on the order}} of mega-hertz (MHz) to giga-hertz (GHz). However, due to hardware <b>pipelining,</b> and complexity of some instructions, some operations take multiple clock cycles to complete. Therefore, it is not always necessary to sample the signal at such a high clock rate. It is often possible to get information on all or most of the operations while sampling {{on the order of}} kilo-hertz (kHz). Different devices leak information at different frequencies. For example, Intel’s Atom processor will leak keys during RSA and AES encryption at frequencies between 50MHz and 85MHz. Android version 4.4’s Bouncy Castle library implementation of ECDSA is vulnerable to key extraction side channel attacks around the 50kHz range.|$|E
500|$|Most modern {{processors}} {{also have}} multiple execution units. They usually combine this feature with <b>pipelining</b> {{and thus can}} issue more than one instruction per clock cycle (...) [...] These processors are known as superscalar processors. Instructions can be grouped together only {{if there is no}} data dependency between them. Scoreboarding and the Tomasulo algorithm (which is similar to scoreboarding but makes use of register renaming) are two of the most common techniques for implementing out-of-order execution and instruction-level parallelism.|$|E

2500|$|The ASCII hyphen-minus {{character}} is also often used when specifying command-line options. The {{character is}} usually followed {{by one or}} more letters that indicate specific actions. Typically it is called a dash or switch in this context. Various implementations of the getopt function to parse command-line options additionally allow the use of two hyphen-minus characters (--) to specify long option names that are more descriptive than their single-letter equivalents. Another use of hyphens is that employed by programs written with <b>pipelining</b> in mind: a single hyphen may be recognized [...] of a filename, with the hyphen then serving as an indicator that a standard stream, instead of a file, is to be worked with.|$|E

2500|$|The {{heat density}} {{generated}} by a supercomputer has a direct dependence on the processor type used in the system, with more powerful processors typically generating more heat, given similar underlying semiconductor technologies. While early supercomputers used a few fast, closely packed processors that took advantage of local parallelism (e.g., <b>pipelining</b> and vector processing), in time the number of processors grew, and computing nodes could be placed further away,e.g., in a computer cluster, or could be geographically dispersed in grid computing. As the number of processors in a supercomputer grows, [...] "component failure rate" [...] begins to become a serious issue. If a supercomputer uses thousands of nodes, each of which may fail once per year on the average, then the system will experience several node failures each day.|$|E
2500|$|Berkeley RISC {{was based}} on gaining {{performance}} {{through the use of}} <b>pipelining</b> and an aggressive use of a technique known as register windowing. In a traditional CPU, one has a small number of registers, and a program can use any register at any time. In a CPU with register windows, there are a huge number of registers, e.g. 128, but programs can only use a small number of them, e.g. eight, at any one time. A program that limits itself to eight registers per procedure can make very fast procedure calls: The call simply moves the window [...] "down" [...] by eight, to the set of eight registers used by that procedure, and the return moves the window back. The Berkeley RISC project delivered the RISC-I processor in 1982. Consisting of only 44,420 transistors (compared with averages of about 100,000 in newer CISC designs of the era) RISC-I had only 32 instructions, and yet completely outperformed any other single-chip design. They followed this up with the 40,760 transistor, 39 instruction RISC-II in 1983, which ran over three times as fast as RISC-I.|$|E
