It was the object of this investigation to measure any differences which had come about {{as a result of the}} treatments. As a means of measuring these possible influences, the Atterberg constants, the moisture constants, and the volume weights were determined. The Atterberg constants which were used were the upper plastic limit, the lower plastic limit, the <b>plasticity</b> <b>number,</b> and the scouring point. The moisture constants employed in this study were the moisture equivalent, the hygroscopic coefficient, the available water capacity, and the maximum water capacity. The greatest attention was focused upon the effects of manurial applications upon the soil, because the chief fertilizer used in Nebraska at the present time is manure. Advisors: M. D. Weldon and H.

40|$|Trichogramma evanescens {{parasitic}} wasps show large {{phenotypic plasticity}} in brain and body size, {{resulting in a}} 5 -fold difference in brain volume among genetically identical sister wasps. Brain volume scales linearly with body volume in these wasps. This isometric brain scaling forms an exception to Haller's rule, which states that small animals have relatively larger brains than large animals. The large plasticity in brain size may be facilitated by plasticity in neuron size, {{in the number of}} neurons, or both. Here, we investigated whether brain isometry requires <b>plasticity</b> in the <b>number</b> and size of monoaminergic neurons that express serotonin (5 HT), octopamine (OA), and dopamine (DA). Genetically identical small and large T. evanescens appear to have the same number of 5 HT-, OA-, and DA-like immunoreactive cell bodies in their brains, but these cell bodies differ in diameter. This indicates that brain isometry can be facilitated by plasticity in the size of monoaminergic neurons, rather than <b>plasticity</b> in <b>numbers</b> of monoaminergic neurons. Selection pressures on body miniaturization may have resulted in the evolution of miniaturized neural pathways that allow even the smallest wasps to find suitable hosts. Plasticity in the size of neural components may be among the mechanisms that underlie isometric brain scaling while maintaining cognitive abilities in the smallest individuals...|$|R

We studied {{the contribution of}} changes in size vs. number of epidermal cells to plastic and evolutionary reduction of wing size in response to poor larval food. We used flies from six populations selected for tolerance to larval malnutrition and from six unselected control populations, raised either under standard conditions or under larval malnutrition. In the control populations, phenotypic plasticity of wing size was mediated by both cell size and cell number. In contrast, evolutionary change in wing size, which was only observed as a correlated response expressed on standard food, was mediated entirely by reduction in cell <b>number.</b> <b>Plasticity</b> of cell <b>number</b> had {{been lost in the}} selected populations, and cell number did not differ between the sexes despite males having smaller wings. Results of this and other experimental evolution studies are consistent with the hypothesis that alleles which increase body size through prolonged growth affect wing size mostly via cell number, whereas alleles which increase size through higher growth rate do so via cell size...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Some natural {{deposits}} of soils under go heavy compression in their geological history {{due to the}} weight of overlying soils. These soils are called preconsolidated or over consolidated and {{have been subjected to}} larger stresses in the past than at present.

40|$|Cell <b>number</b> <b>plasticity</b> drives organismal growth, and is coupled in the CNS to the {{emergence}} of neural circuits, ensuring appropriate function. In mammals, neurotrophins promote cell survival via Trk and p 75 ^NTR receptors or induce cell death via p 75 ^NTR and Sortilin. In Drosophila, DNTs bind Toll receptors promoting cell survival, but whether they regulate cell death within the CNS remains unknown. I show Toll receptors have distinct and overlapping spatial and temporal expression and functions. Driving RNAi knockdown and overexpression of each Toll, I show that different Toll receptors are required in glia for adult locomotion; in neurons for the regulation of VNC size; and to induce cell survival or death in distinct contexts. I focused on the signalling mechanisms downstream of Toll- 6. My data show DNT-Toll- 6 signalling switches between promoting cell survival or death via NFkB, ERK, or JNK signalling. These outcomes depend on the cleavage state of the DNT, time and available downstream adaptors. Toll- 6 induces cell survival via MyD 88 and cell death via dSarm, and these alternative outcomes depend on Weckle. Altogether, my data contribute to showing that the Toll receptors, DNTs and downstream signalling adaptors constitute a novel mechanism of cell <b>number</b> <b>plasticity</b> within the CNS...|$|R
40|$|Calcium-evoked {{dendritic}} exocytosis (CEDE), {{demonstrated in}} cultured hippocampal neurons, {{is a novel}} mechanism that could {{play a role in}} synaptic <b>plasticity.</b> A <b>number</b> of forms of neuronal plasticity are thought to be mediated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Here, we investigate the role of CaMKII in CEDE. We find that the developmental time course of CEDE parallels the expression of alphaCaMKII, a dominant subunit of CaMKII. An inhibitor of this enzyme, KN- 62, blocks CEDE. Furthermore, 7 d in vitro neurons (which normally do not express alphaCaMKII nor show CEDE) can undergo CEDE when infected with a recombinant virus producing alphaCaMKII. Expression of a constitutively active CaMKII produces dendritic exocytosis in the absence of calcium stimulus, and this exocytosis is blocked by nocodazole, an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization that also blocks CEDE. These results indicate that CEDE is mediated by the activation of CaMKII, consistent with the view that CEDE plays a role in synaptic plasticity...|$|R
40|$|Angelman {{syndrome}} (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder {{characterized by}} severe mental retardation, lack of speech, ataxia, susceptibility to seizures, and unique behavioral {{features such as}} easily provoked smiling and laughter and autistic features. The disease is primarily caused by deletion or loss-of-function mutations of the maternally inherited UBE 3 A gene located within chromosome 15 q 11 -q 13. The UBE 3 A gene encodes a 100 [*]kDa protein that functions as ubiquitin ligase and transcriptional coactivator.

40|$|The mossy fibers of the {{hippocampus}} display NMDA-receptor independent long-term <b>plasticity.</b> A <b>number</b> of studies addressed {{the role of}} mossy fiber long-term plasticity in memory, but have provided contrasting results. Here, we have exploited a genetic model, the rab 3 A null-mutant, which {{is characterized by the}} absence of both mossy fiber long-term potentiation and long-term depression. This mutant was backcrossed to 129 S 3 /SvImJ and C 57 Bl/ 6 J to obtain standardized genetic backgrounds. Spatial working memory, assessed in the eight-arm radial maze, was unchanged in rab 3 A null-mutants. Moreover, one-trial cued and contextual fear conditioning was normal. Long-term spatial memory was tested in the Morris water maze. Two different versions of this task were used, an 'easy' version and a 'difficult' one. On both versions, no differences in search time and quadrant preferences were observed. Thus, despite the elimination of mossy fiber long-term plasticity, these tests revealed no impairments in mnemonic capabilities. We conclude that spatial, contextual and working memory do not depend on mossy fiber plasticity. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of nutritional level and flower location on factors related to flower, pollen, and ovule production, and to determine what developmental patterns would be modified to mediate any observed changes. Plants subjected to high nutrient levels developed larger leaves, more branches, more flowers on both the main stem and the branches, and opened their first flowers 6 days sooner than plants at lower levels of nutrients. Total flower number increased from 72. 2 to 626. 8 per plant, with most of the increase produced on the primary branches. The number of pollen grains in the entire androecium averaged 14, 685, but significantly increased with higher nutrient levels and decreased with the stage of plant maturity (nodal position on the plant). The number of ovules also increased with nutrient level and decreased with maturity stage. Average ovule number decreased from about 129 in flowers at nodes produced early in the growth cycle to about 100 in flowers produced at later nodes. Despite highly significant <b>plasticity</b> in <b>numbers</b> of both pollen and ovules, the Pollen/Ovule Ratio (average 132. 7) did not vary significantly with either nutrient level or plant maturity stage. Path analysis, which decomposes correlation coefficients into direct and indirect effects of factors influencing development, indicated that nutrient level had a very strong direct effect on the number of primary branches and on the number of primary-branch flowers, as well as very strong indirect effects on the latter. The primary-branch flowers directly determined over 67 % of the total flower number, and indirectly determined about 24 % jointly with secondary-branch flowers, and over 3 % jointly with main-stem flowers. The direct effects of secondary-branch flowers and mainstem flowers were 3. 8 % and 0. 3 %, respectively. The relationship among components of yield is slightly additive. Direct determination of yield was 74. 6 % by the number of flowers per plant, 0. 6 % by the number of ovules per flower, 3. 8 % by the number of seeds per ovule, and 1. 1 % by the weight per seed. The proportion of yield jointly determined by flower number and the developed seeds per ovule was 15. 3 %. It was concluded that allocation of resources increases to both male and female functions under conditions of high nutrient levels, and pollen/ovule ratios are consistent within a plant despite significant <b>plasticity</b> in <b>numbers</b> of pollen grains and ovules...|$|R

40|$|Decreased {{expression}} of dopamine D 2 receptors (D 2 R), dysfunction of inhibitory neurotransmission and impairments {{in the structure}} and connectivity of neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) {{are involved in the}} pathogenesis of schizophrenia and major depression, but the relationship between these changes remains unclear. The polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), a plasticity-related molecule, may serve as a link. This molecule is expressed in cortical interneurons and dopamine, via D 2 R, modulates its expression in parallel to that of proteins related to synapses and inhibitory neurotransmission, suggesting that D 2 R-targeted antipsychotics/antidepressants may act by affecting the plasticity of mPFC inhibitory circuits. To understand the role of PSA-NCAM in this plasticity, rats were chronically treated with a D 2 R agonist (PPHT) after cortical PSA depletion.

40|$|During {{the course}} of adult {{cortical}} <b>plasticity,</b> a <b>number</b> of signal transduction mechanisms are brought into play. To study regulatory genes implicated in this process, we inhibited gene expression by harnessing the machinery of RNA interference (RNAi) pathway via small hairpin RNAs (shRNA) delivered by viral vectors. Using this technology we sought to influence plasticity of the mouse vibrissal barrel cortex. In this model system, chronic whisker plucking reliably leads {{to the expansion of}} the cortical representation of the adjacent non-deprived whiskers. The mechanism underlying this process involves changes in synaptic efficacy and sprouting of axon collaterals. Initial studies describing the molecular events leading to synaptogenesis and remapping have implicated a number of signal transduction pathways, including neurotrophins such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Though previous experiments have shown up-regulation of neurotrophins and their receptors in reorganized cortex, it is necessary to remove these factors to definitively prove their involvement in adult cortical plasticity. We therefore repressed neurotrophic gene expression in the mouse somatosensory cortex to determine if these trophic factors are essential for cortical remodeling after sensory deprivation. We blocked gene expression in vivo using a non-replicative adeno-associated virus bearing genes encoding shRNA constructs. The shRNA nucleotide sequences were designed to target and destroy selected neurotrophin messenger RNAs by triggering the RNAi pathway, resulting in a reduction of BDNF protein levels by up to 80...|$|R

40|$|Pharmacological {{interventions}} to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) with antiretrovirals (ARVs), have dramatically improved the survival rates of HIV positive children maturing into adulthood. However, HIV-associated neurocognitive decline still persists {{in the era}} of ARVs. Within the framework of brain <b>plasticity,</b> a <b>number</b> of researchers have begun to assess the feasibility of cognitive rehabilitation therapy as a complement to ARVs to reverse neurocognitive decline as a result of HIV (e. g., Becker et al., 2012). Only one study has been conducted in South Africa, by Zondo & Mulder (2014), assessing the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation in a paediatric sample. The current research builds on the above mentioned study by implementing an experimental approach to examine the effect of cognitive rehabilitation in a sample of both HIV positive and HIV negative children. Five HIV positive and six HIV negative children were assigned to either an experimental or control group. The experimental group underwent two months of cognitive rehabilitation therapy remediating sustained attention, whereas the control group took part in placebo activities. Sustained attention measures were taken before and after the intervention training sessions, using a sustained attention subtest from the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-CH). A Mann Whitney U Test revealed that the experimental group (Mdn= 38. 50) did not differ significantly from the control group (Mdn = 37. 00) after the cognitive rehabilitation intervention, U= 12. 00, z= -. 55, p=. 66, r= -. 17.

40|$|The {{developing}} {{brain has}} the capacity for {{a great deal of}} <b>plasticity.</b> A <b>number</b> of investigators have demonstrated that intellectual and language skills may be in the normal range in children following unilateral perinatal stroke. Questions have been raised, however, about whether these skills can be maintained at the same level as the brain matures. This study aimed to examine the stability of intellectual, academic and language functioning during development in children with perinatal stroke, and to resolve the inconsistencies raised in previous studies. Participants were 29 pre-school to school-age children with documented unilateral ischaemic perinatal stroke and 24 controls. Longitudinal testing of intellectual and cognitive abilities was conducted at two time points. Study 1 examined IQ, academic skills and language functions using the same test version over the test–retest interval. Study 2 examined IQ over a longer test–retest interval (pre-school to school-age), and utilized different test versions. This study has resulted in important new findings. There is no evidence of decline in cognitive function over time in children with perinatal unilateral brain damage. These results indicate that there is sufficient ongoing plasticity in the developing brain following early focal damage to result in the stability of cognitive functions over time. Also, the presence of seizures limits plasticity such that there is not only significantly lower performance on intellectual and language measures in the seizure group (Study 1), but the course of cognitive development is significantly altered (as shown in Study 2). This study provides information to support the notion of functional plasticity in the developing brain; yields much-needed clarification in the literature of prognosis in children with early ischaemic perinatal stroke; provides evidence that seizures limit plasticity during development; and avoids many of the confounds in prior studies. A greater understanding of how children with ischaemic perinatal stroke fare over time is particularly important, as there has been conflicting information regarding prognosis for this population. It appears that when damage is sustained very early in brain development, cerebral functional reorganization acts to sustain a stable rate of development over time...|$|R

One such trait is a plant's sex allocation (or gender), which influences its reproductive success directly {{as a function of}} the potentially heterogeneous mating prospects in the population. However, it is unknown how polyploidy per se might affect plasticity in a plant's sex allocation. Although there have been numerous comparisons between diploid and (usually) tetraploid taxa, we know very little about how elevated ploidy above the diploid level might affect plasticity. Here, we ask whether different ploidy levels > 2 x express different plasticity in the ruderal plant Mercurialis annua. We grew tetraploid and hexaploid hermaphrodites under different levels of nutrient availability and compared their reaction norms for growth (above-ground biomass, SLA) and reproductive traits (reproductive effort, phenotypic gender). Overall, we found that an increase in ploidy level from 4 x to 6 x in M. annua is associated with an increase in the relative biomass allocated to seeds, measured as female reproductive effort. However, our study provides no support for the idea that increasing ploidy level increases the ability to express different phenotypes in response to changes in the environment...|$|R

Although instar {{number is}} {{frequently}} {{considered to be}} invariable within species, intraspeciÞc variability {{in the number of}} instars is not an exceptional phenomenon. However, the knowledge has remained fragmentary, and there are no recent attempts to synthesize the results of relevant studies. Based on published case studies,we show that intraspeciÞc variability in thenumber of larval instars iswidespread across insect taxa, occurring in most major orders, in both hemimetabolous and holometabolous insects. We give an overview of various factors that have been observed to affect the number of instars. Temperature, photoperiod, foodquality andquantity, humidity, rearing density, physical condition, inheritance, and sex are themost common factors inßuencing the number of instars. We discuss adaptive scenarios that may provide ultimate explanations for the <b>plasticity</b> in instar <b>number.</b> The data available largely support the compensation scenario, according towhich instar number increases in adverse conditions when larvae fail to reach a species-speciÞc threshold size formetamorphosis. However, in Orthoptera and Coleoptera, there are some exceptional species in which instar number is higher in favorable conditions. In more speciÞc cases, the adaptive value of the variability in instar number may be in reaching or maintaining the developmental stage adapted to hibernation, producing additional gen...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of phenotypic <b>plasticity</b> requires a <b>number</b> of conditions. Selection of plasticity is favoured when the organism experience environmental change, costs are low and cues are reliable about the environmental heterogeneity. However, organisms living in stable environments, not showing constitutive traits {{but a large}} amount of plasticity, are predicted to demonstrate high rates of gene flow in order for selection to favour the {{evolution of}} phenotypic plasticity, which accordingly should provide weak genetic structures across populations. We used the pulmonate freshwater gastropod Radix balthica, a species with known and considerable shell shape variation due to predator-induced plasticity, and used amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to test if the rate of gene flow can explain the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. Since R. balthica inhabit water bodies with different but consistent predator regimes, we envisaged a large dispersal rate. However, we found a contradictory result with clear population structures, even among adjacent ponds in southern Sweden. We discuss this apparent paradox in contrast to the evolution of ecotype formation, colonization mechanisms that have the potential to reduce gene flow and, in the context of costs of plasticity, we consider new perspectives about relaxed and variable selection that may drive the evolution of phenotypic plasticity...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The {{study of}} achaete-scute (ac/sc) genes has {{recently}} become a paradigm {{to understand the}} evolution {{and development of the}} arthropod nervous system. We describe the identification and characterization of the ache genes in the coleopteran insect species Tribolium castaneum. We have identified two Tribolium ache genes - achaete-scute homolog (Tc-ASH) a proneural gene and asense (Tc-ase) a neural precursor gene that reside in a gene complex. Focusing on the embryonic central nervous system we fmd that Tc-ASH is expressed in all neural precursors and the proneural clusters from which they segregate. Through RNAi and misexpression studies we show that Tc-ASH is necessary for neural precursor formation in Triboliurn and sufficient for neural precursor formation in Drosophila. Comparison of the function of the Drosophila and Triboliurn proneural ac/sc genes suggests that in the Drosophila lineage these genes have maintained their ancestral function in neural precursor formation and have acquired a new role in the fate specification of individual neural precursors. Furthermore, we find that Tc-use is expressed in all neural precursors suggesting an important and conserved role for asense genes in insect nervous system development. Our analysis of the Triboliurn ache genes indicates significant <b>plasticity</b> in gene <b>number,</b> expression and function, and implicates these modifications in the evolution of arthropod neural development...|$|R
40|$|Spike time {{dependent}} plasticity (STDP) {{has been}} observed in both developing and adult animals. Theoretical studies suggest that it implicitly leads to both competition and homeostasis in addition to correlation-based plasticity, making it a good candidate to explain developmental refinement and <b>plasticity</b> in a <b>number</b> of systems. However, it has only been observed to play a clear role in development in {{a small number of}} cases. Because the fast time scales necessary to elicit STDP, it would likely be inefficient in governing synaptic modifications in the absence of fast correlations in neural activity. In contrast, later stages of development often depend on sensory inputs that can drive activity on much faster time scales, suggesting a role in STDP in many sensory systems after opening of the eyes and ear canals. Correlations on fast time scales can be also be present earlier in developing microcircuits, such as those produced by specific transient “teacher” circuits in the cerebral cortex. By reviewing examples of each case, we suggest that STDP is not a universal rule, but rather might be masked or phased in, depending on the information available to instruct refinement in different developing circuits. Thus, this review describes selected cases where STDP has been studied in developmental contexts, and uses these examples to suggest a more general framework for understanding where it could be playing a role in development...|$|R
40|$|Spike-timing {{dependent}} plasticity is {{a learning}} mechanism used extensively within neural modelling. The learning rule {{has been shown}} to allow a neuron to find the onset of a spatio-temporal pattern repeated among its afferents. In this thesis, the first question addressed is ‘what does this neuron learn?’ With a spiking neuron model and linear prediction, evidence is adduced that the neuron learns two components: (1) the level of average background activity and (2) specific spike times of a pattern. Taking advantage of these findings, a network is developed that can train recognisers for longer spatio-temporal input signals using spike-timing dependent <b>plasticity.</b> Using a <b>number</b> of neurons that are mutually connected by plastic synapses and subject to a global winner-takes-all mechanism, chains of neurons can form where each neuron is selective to a different segment of a repeating input pattern, and the neurons are feedforwardly connected {{in such a way that}} both the correct stimulus and the firing of the previous neurons are required in order to activate the next neuron in the chain. This is akin to a simple class of finite state automata. Following this, a novel resource-based STDP learning rule is introduced. The learning rule has several advantages over typical implementations of STDP and results in synaptic statistics which match favourably with those observed experimentally. For example, synaptic weight distributions and the presence of silent synapses match experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Among songbirds, {{the zebra}} finch (Taeniopygia guttata) is an {{excellent}} model system for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying complex behaviours such as vocal communication, learning and social interactions. Neuropeptides and peptide hormones are cell-to-cell signalling molecules known to mediate similar behaviours in other animals. However, in the zebra finch, this information is limited. With the newly-released zebra finch genome as a foundation, we combined bioinformatics, mass-spectrometry (MS) -enabled peptidomics and molecular techniques to identify the complete suite of neuropeptide prohormones and final peptide products and their distributions. Results Complementary bioinformatic resources were integrated to survey the zebra finch genome, identifying 70 putative prohormones. Ninety peptides derived from 24 predicted prohormones were characterized using several MS platforms; tandem MS confirmed {{a majority of the}} sequences. Most of the peptides described here were not known in the zebra finch or other avian species, although homologous prohormones exist in the chicken genome. Among the zebra finch peptides discovered were several unique vasoactive intestinal and adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1 peptides created by cleavage at sites previously unreported in mammalian prohormones. MS-based profiling of brain areas required for singing detected 13 peptides within one brain nucleus, HVC; in situ hybridization detected 13 of the 15 prohormone genes examined within at least one major song control nucleus. Expression mapping also identified prohormone messenger RNAs in areas associated with spatial learning and social behaviours. Based on the whole-genome analysis, 40 prohormone probes were found on a commonly used zebra finch brain microarray. Analysis of these newly annotated transcripts revealed that six prohormone probes showed altered expression after birds heard song playbacks in a paradigm of song recognition learning; we partially verify this result experimentally. Conclusions The zebra finch peptidome and prohormone complement is now characterized. Based on previous microarray results on zebra finch vocal learning and synaptic <b>plasticity,</b> a <b>number</b> of these prohormones show significant changes during learning. Interestingly, most mammalian prohormones have counterparts in the zebra finch, demonstrating that this songbird uses similar biochemical pathways for neurotransmission and hormonal regulation. These findings enhance investigation into neuropeptide-mediated mechanisms of brain function, learning and behaviour in this model. </p...|$|R
40|$|Signal {{transmission}} across chemical synapses relies crucially on neurotransmitter receptor molecules, {{concentrated in}} postsynaptic membrane domains along with scaffold and other postsynaptic molecules. The {{strength of the}} transmitted signal depends {{on the number of}} receptor molecules in postsynaptic domains, and activity-induced variation in the receptor number is one of the mechanisms of postsynaptic plasticity. Recent experiments have demonstrated that the reaction and diffusion properties of receptors and scaffolds at the membrane, alone, yield spontaneous formation of receptor-scaffold domains of the stable characteristic size observed in neurons. On the basis of these experiments we develop a model describing synaptic receptor domains in terms of the underlying reaction-diffusion processes. Our model predicts that the spontaneous formation of receptor-scaffold domains of the stable characteristic size observed in experiments depends on a few key reactions between receptors and scaffolds. Furthermore, our model suggests novel mechanisms for the alignment of pre- and postsynaptic domains and for short-term postsynaptic <b>plasticity</b> in receptor <b>number.</b> We predict that synaptic receptor domains localize in membrane regions with an increased receptor diffusion coefficient or a decreased scaffold diffusion coefficient. Similarly, we find that activity-dependent increases or decreases in receptor or scaffold diffusion yield a transient {{increase in the number of}} receptor molecules concentrated in postsynaptic domains. Thus, the proposed reaction-diffusion model puts forth a coherent set of biophysical mechanisms for the formation, stability, and plasticity of molecular domains on the postsynaptic membrane.
