5|$|After the Labour Party was {{defeated}} at the 2010 general election, Brown resigned as Leader of the Labour Party; in September 2010, Miliband {{was elected to}} replace him. His tenure as Labour leader was characterised by a leftward shift in his party's policies, and by opposition to the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government's cuts to the public sector. He led his party into several elections, including the 2014 European Parliament election. Following Labour's defeat by the Conservative <b>Party</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2015 general election, Miliband announced his resignation as leader on 8 May 2015. He was succeeded in the ensuing leadership election by Jeremy Corbyn.|$|E
5|$|Bradley was {{unanimously}} {{chosen as}} a delegate-at-large to six consecutive Republican National Conventions. At the 1880 Republican National Convention in Chicago, he was unanimously chosen to second Roscoe Conkling's nomination of Ulysses S. Grant {{for a third}} term as president. His rousing oratory gained him the attention of prominent leaders of his <b>party.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> 1884 convention, he was instrumental in defeating a motion to curtail Southern states' representation. President Chester A. Arthur chose Bradley to help recover financial damages from postal officials involved in the Star Route Frauds in 1885, but Bradley resigned this responsibility over differences with U.S. Attorney General Benjamin H. Brewster regarding the prosecution of these cases.|$|E

5|$|By February 2001 the Workers' Communist Party {{proposed}} making Folkvord the {{new leader}} of the Red Electoral Alliance, since Myhre would resign if {{he was elected to}} parliament. While the majority of the members wanted a female leader after the departure of Myhre, his supporters were perfectly aware that Folkvord could lose the nomination and a campaign was started to make him deputy leader. The main problem for Folkvord's opposition was his close ties to the Workers' Communist <b>Party.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> convention Myhre was re-elected the party's party leader, with Folkvord and Chris Hartmann stepping in as the party's new deputy leaders. Myhre did not become a member of parliament.|$|E

The Ardrossan and Saltcoats Herald reported that as a parliamentarian, she developed a reputation as a party rebel who, {{at the time of the}} leadership contest, had most recently voted against British participation in the 2014 military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. She won the support of UNISON after announcing her intention to enter the deputy leadership contest, and was also backed by the Communication Workers' Union, Unite, the GMB, and the Musicians' Union.|$|E

Later, Andy (Chris Pratt) and April (Aubrey Plaza) invite everyone to a dinner <b>party</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> home of Andy's band-mate Burly (Andrew Burlinson), where Andy is living. Ben (Adam Scott) tells Leslie (Amy Poehler) that his boss in Indianapolis wants him back on the road, but he has also been offered a job to work under Chris (Rob Lowe) in Pawnee. Although Leslie wants Ben to stay, she is hesitant to say so outright, disappointing him and leaving him conflicted over which job to take.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950 campaign, both Nixon and Douglas {{were accused}} of having a voting record {{comparable}} to that of New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio. The sole congressman from the American Labor <b>Party</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, Marcantonio represented East Harlem. He was accused of being a communist, though he denied being one; he rarely discussed the Soviet Union or communism. Marcantonio opposed restrictions on communists and the Communist Party, stating that such restrictions violated the Bill of Rights. He regularly voted against contempt citations requested by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), on which Nixon served.|$|E
5|$|Editor Larssen and subeditor Solbakken both {{joined the}} Communist Party in 1923 and {{continued}} running the newspaper. As Olav Larssen {{was asked by}} the party to be the acting editor of Norges Kommunistblad in the winter of 1924–1925, Fredrik Monsen, Evald Solbakken, and Knut Olai Thornæs were acting editors between 1924 and 1925. Larssen eventually drifted away from the mainstream of the Communist Party. In late 1926 and early 1927 he voiced his opinion in columns that the Communist Party should contribute to the imminent merger of the Labour Party and the Social Democratic Labour Party. A local party convention strongly rebuked this opinion. Larssen was thus replaced in January 1927 and left the Communist Party, and Solbakken soon followed suit. Fredrik Monsen left the <b>party</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time.|$|E
5|$|Gjems-Onstad's {{cooperation}} with Hagen was however not to last. In early 1976 Gjems-Onstad voiced his discontent with the ever-ongoing conflicts within the party, {{and he had}} by mid-year not decided {{whether or not he}} wanted to run for re-election. He eventually felt squeezed out of the party, and wanted no part in the intriguing he considered Hagen to represent. He was replaced as parliamentary leader of the <b>party</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of October. After he in turn recommended voters to rather vote for the Conservative Party in an interview with Aftenposten, he was finally expelled from the party by a unanimously approved motion put forward by Carl I. Hagen later the same month. Gjems-Onstad finished his term as an independent.|$|E
