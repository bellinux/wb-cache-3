5|$|Some time in July, <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> before Climbié was {{admitted}} to the Central Middlesex Hospital, Kouao befriended a couple, Julien and Chantal Kimbidima. Climbié and Kouao visited their home several times over the following months. According to Chantal, Kouao would shout at Climbié all the time and never showed her affection.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} was completed early in van der Weyden's career, <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> after his apprenticeship with Robert Campin ended. Although highly accomplished, it {{is filled with}} symbolism of a kind absent from his more mature works. It is one of three attributed paintings, all early works, that show the Virgin and Child set within an architectural setting, surrounded with painted sculptural figures, the others being The Madonna Standing and the Durán Madonna.|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis littoralis (Linnaeus, 1789)– was {{described}} from brackish water by Linnaeus {{as a separate}} species, originally named Nerita littoralis. A study by Zettler (2008) proved that {{its status as a}} subspecies is unjustified, being regarded as a synonym of Theodoxus fluviatilis. Although these so-called forms (form fluviatilis and form littoralis) differ in morphology, ecology, reproductive strategy and behaviour, they are <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> ecomorphs.|$|E

50|$|The first {{historical}} {{records of the}} castles date to the 13th century, when a Friderici quondam de Thvchervelt was mentioned on 26 November 1243, they were <b>probably</b> built <b>just</b> before this.|$|R
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) starts {{dating a}} Brussels sprout farmer, Esther Bruegger (Nora Kirkpatrick), while {{negotiating}} {{the purchase of}} a tractor with her father Henry (Allan Havey). Dwight does poorly in the negotiations, yielding to all of Henry's terms. During the haggling, Esther's sisters flirt with Clark Green (Clark Duke) and try to coax him into buying farming equipment. Clark stops Dwight from signing the papers and takes him aside to tell him that he thinks Esther and her sisters are too physically attractive to be interested in men like them, and that Esther is <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> dating him so that her father can take advantage of him on the tractor deal. Dwight sees the logic in Clark's suspicion. However, Esther appears and tells Dwight that he should not sign the contract and negotiate for a better deal. Dwight realizes that Esther does care for him after all, much to Angela's dismay.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey was consecrated on 18 August 1191, at Tours in France, by Bartholomew, the Archbishop of Tours, {{after the}} papacy {{agreed to allow}} the consecration. This {{permission}} was secured by {{the intervention of the}} king and his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Turner and Heiser see the presumed motivation behind Eleanor and Richard's support {{as part of an effort}} to secure a counter-weight to the power exercised in England by the Chancellor, William Longchamp, about whom complaints had reached Richard in Sicily. Geoffrey received his pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, at his consecration. In September 1191, after the consecration, he attempted to go to York, but was met at Dover by agents of Longchamp, and even though he took refuge in the priory of St. Martin in Dover, was dragged from sanctuary and imprisoned in Dover Castle. Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn fealty to Richard, but this was <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> an excuse to eliminate a rival. Another complication was that the English bishops had appealed to the papacy because Geoffrey had not been consecrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Longchamp could therefore claim to have been acting on behalf of the other bishops in ordering Geoffrey's arrest. But the actions of Longchamp's agents were considered excessive and there was soon an outcry against the Chancellor's arrest of Geoffrey, even though Longchamp claimed that his orders had been exceeded by his agents. One cause of the outrage was the obvious parallel with the murder of Thomas Becket, who had been dragged from an altar and martyred. The archbishop was released and took part in a council held at Loddon Bridge, between Reading and Windsor; Longchamp was excommunicated and deposed from the chancellorship, and Hugh of Lincoln, the Bishop of Lincoln, excommunicated those who had dragged Geoffrey from sanctuary. Geoffrey was then enthroned at York on 1 November 1191.|$|E

50|$|In 2006, Welcome to the World was re-released {{with two}} bonus tracks. These tracks contain Solli {{from the first}} album on vocals, and were <b>probably</b> {{recorded}} <b>just</b> {{before he left the}} band in 1997.|$|R

25|$|Finally, the Roman praenomen (given name) Caeso {{was said}} to be given to {{children}} who were born via C-section. While this was <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> folk etymology made popular by Pliny the Elder, it was well known by the time the term came into common use.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} written {{mention of}} the town {{dates back to the}} 12th century, when Saxo Grammaticus in Gesta Danorum refers to it as Portus Mercatorum, which translates into Merchants' Harbour or in the Danish of the time Købmannahavn. In a letter from 1186, Pope Urban III refers to the city as Hafn, but this is <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> a shortened version of the full name.|$|E
25|$|In 1820, several {{expedition}}s {{claimed to}} have been the first to have sighted the ice shelf or the continent. A Russian expedition was led by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev, a British expedition was captained by Edward Bransfield and an American sealer Nathaniel Palmer participated. The first landing was <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> over a year later when American Captain John Davis, a sealer, set foot on the ice.|$|E
25|$|Although the Notitia Episcopatuum under emperor Leo VI (early 10th century) still lists Tindari {{among the}} suffragans of Syracuse, that <b>probably</b> was <b>just</b> {{canonical}} theory, as in 836 Tindari was conquered for Islam by Arabs {{and nothing is}} heard from the diocese.|$|R

50|$|Phormio: An admiral who {{had secured}} Athenian {{control of the}} sea early in the war, he <b>probably</b> died <b>just</b> before The Knights was {{produced}} and he is mentioned here in a hymn to Poseidon (line 562). He is mentioned in two other plays.|$|R
25|$|However, {{despite the}} fact that the papyrus is in the form of a letter to the vizier, it was <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> a {{personal}} copy. According to Černý, a letter to the vizier would have begun with a long address enumerating the numerous titles of the vizier. In addition, such a letter would be in the archives of the Vizier, and would not have made their way into the hands of Henry Salt.|$|E
25|$|Riina is {{currently}} held in a maximum-security prison with limited {{contact with the outside}} world in order to prevent him from running his organization from behind bars, as many others have done. Over $US125,000,000 in assets were confiscated from Riina, <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> a fraction of his illicit fortune, and his vast mansion was also acquired by the crusading anti-Mafia mayor of Corleone in 1997. The mansion was subsequently converted into a school for local children.|$|E
25|$|When {{the first}} forests arose on Earth, new niches for {{terrestrial}} animals were created. Spore-feeders {{and others who}} depended on plants and/or the animals living around them would have to adapt too {{to make use of}} them. In a world with no flying animals, it would <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> be {{a matter of time before}} some arthropods who were living in the trees evolved paired structures with muscle attachments from their exoskeleton and used them for gliding, one pair on each segment. Further evolution in this direction would give bigger gliding structures on their thorax and gradually smaller ones on their abdomen. Their bodies would have become stiffer while thysanurans, which didn't evolve flight, kept their flexible abdomen.|$|E

25|$|With {{the close}} of the Palaeozoic, most of the Permian groups disappeared, with the {{exception}} of the Mastodonsauroid and Metoposaurid families and the curious Plagiosauridae, who continued into the Triassic. In the early Triassic these families enjoyed a brief renaissance in the waterways of continental shallows, with large forms like Thoosuchus, Benthosuchus and Eryosuchus. Their ecological niches were probably similar to those of modern-day crocodiles, as fish hunters and riverside carnivores. All groups developed progressively weaker vertebrae, reduced limb ossification and flatter skulls with prominent lateral line organs, indicating the late Permian/early Triassic temnospondyls rarely if ever left the water. An extremely large Brachyopid (likely a plagiosaur or a close relative) is estimated to have been 7 meters long, and <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> as heavy as the Permian Prionosuchus.|$|E
25|$|His fame {{does not}} rest upon his {{association}} with St Peter’s but in his building of the Farnese Palace, “the grandest palace of this period”, started in 1530. The impression of grandness lies in part in its sheer size, (56m long by 29.5 meters high) and in its lofty location overlooking a broad piazza. It is also a building of beautiful proportion, unusual for such a large and luxurious house of the date in having been built principally of stuccoed brick, rather than of stone. Against the smooth pink-washed walls the stone quoins of the corners, the massive rusticated portal and the stately repetition of finely detailed windows give a powerful effect, setting a new standard of elegance in palace-building. The upper of the three equally sized floors was added by Michelangelo. It is <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> as well that this impressive building is of brick; the travertine for its architectural details came not from a quarry, but from the Colosseum.|$|E
25|$|In April of {{his seventh}} year, Amenhotep {{was faced with}} a major {{rebellion}} in Syria by the vassal states of Naharin and dispatched his army to the Levant to suppress it. This rebellion was likely instigated by Egypt's chief Near Eastern rival, Mitanni. His stele of victory carved after this campaign records no major battles, which has been read a number of ways. It may be that this campaign was more similar to one of the tours of Syria which his father had fought, and he only engaged minor garrisons in battle and forced cities to swear allegiance to himoaths immediately broken after his departure. Alternatively, it appears that the two weeks when Amenhotep would have been closest to Mitanni are omitted from the stele, thus it is possible that his army was defeated on this campaign. Amenhotep's last campaign took place in his ninth year, however it apparently did not proceed farther north than the Sea of Galilee. According to the list of plunder from this campaign, Amenhotep took 101,128 slaves, which is an obviously exaggerated figure. Some of these slaves may have been recounted from the year 7 campaign, such as 15,070 citizens of Nukhash, since Amenhotep did not campaign anywhere near Nukhash on his year 9 campaign. However, even accounting for this recounting, the numbers still are too high to be realistic, and are <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> exaggerated.|$|E

500|$|The Grade II listed 18th-century King's Head is {{probably}} the oldest public house in the village; the nearby Lion and Royal dates from 1824 and is also Grade II listed. It was <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> called [...] "The Lion" [...] when it first opened, but added [...] "Royal" [...] to its name in honour of a special visitor.
