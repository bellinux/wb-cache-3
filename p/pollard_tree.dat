40|$|The {{sprouting}} {{capacity of}} some broadleaves {{has been used}} for their regeneration since ancient times. Often concurrently with taking advantage of sprouting stools, the trees used to be shaped also by pruning their stems, namely on pasturelands and in grazing forests. The activity of woodcutters and shepherds was obviously rather common in warmer climates with broadleaved stands because coppice and pollard trees appear relatively often in the visual arts from ancient works through the period if the Italian and German Renaissance up to the romantic and realistic landscape painting of the 19 th century overlapping into the 20 th century. For centuries, most frequently illustrated in European and Czech paintings have been pollard willows (Salix spp.). Other coppice and <b>pollard</b> <b>tree</b> species identified in paintings are oaks (Quercus spp.), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), European chestnut (Castanea sativa), and rarely other species, too. Artists apparently often used bizarrely shaped woods to increase the dramatic atmosphere of their landscape sceneries as well as figural compositions, and the coppice and pollard trees had certainly also a symbolic meaning in some of their works...|$|E

40|$|In {{agroforestry}} systems (AFS) {{with annual}} intercrops, {{the competition for}} light, water and nitrogen plays a key role. Mature trees capture a larger part of the resources, and the yield of the intercrop decreases. When the tree stem density is high (> 50 stems. ha - 1), the yield of the intercrop may therefore drop to unprofitable levels. A possible solution to that competition problem would be {{to reduce the size}} of the <b>trees</b> by <b>pollarding.</b> <b>Pollarded</b> <b>trees</b> produce both timber with the bole and biomass or fodder with the leaves and branches that are regularly pruned every 2 to 10 year. The reduction of the size of the crown would also be profitable to the intercrops, allowing a sustained and profitable yield even with old trees. The concept was evaluated both by modeling with the Hi-sAFe numerical model and by an experiment comparing standard walnut <b>trees</b> and <b>pollarded</b> walnut <b>trees.</b> Numerical runs of the model indicate that AFS with <b>pollarded</b> <b>trees</b> may reach very high levels of tree-crop complementary, achieving higher Land Equivalent Ratios than AFS with standard trees. However, the model predicts that the diameter growth of the trunk could be heavily reduced by the pollarding regime. These predictions should be confirmed by field experiment. We settled an experiment with walnut trees aged 16 years in spring 2013. During the first growing season after pollarding, the girth growth of the <b>pollarded</b> <b>trees</b> was surprisingly not reduced, as compared to standard unpollarded trees. Some hypotheses to explain this behaviour are discussed. If this result is confirmed during the next years, the model should be modified to incorporate this aspect, and the productivity of the AFS with <b>pollarded</b> <b>trees</b> could be even higher...|$|R

40|$|In {{historic}} times pollarding {{has been}} an important way of collecting, among a wide range of other things, food for your animals, wood for your stove and material for handicraft and woodwork. Nowadays those uses are gone. Today the main reasons for pollarding in the countryside and keeping previously <b>pollarded</b> <b>trees</b> alive are to retain an important cultural heritage and to maintain the amazing range of biodiversity depending on them. This theses is an attempt to gather information and actual ‘know-how’ from the people who work with the planning of, and the actual restoration of these trees. To accomplish this, they were presented with a list of questions and the answers they gave where put together to create an overview of how they reason when planning and executing their work and thus enable comparisons.

25|$|An {{incidental}} {{effect of}} pollarding in woodland is {{the encouragement of}} underbrush growth due to increased levels of light reaching the woodland floor. This can increase species diversity. However, in woodland where pollarding was once common but has now ceased, the opposite effect occurs, as the side and top shoots develop into trunk-sized branches. An example {{of this can be}} seen in Epping Forest in London/Essex, UK, the majority of which was pollarded until the late 19th century. Here, the light that reaches the woodland floor is extremely limited owing to the thick growth of the <b>pollarded</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|R
50|$|Carpinus betulus is a shade-loving tree, which prefers {{moderate}} {{soil fertility}} and moisture. It has a shallow, wide-spreading root system and {{is marked by}} the production of stump sprouts when cut back. Because it stands up well to cutting back and has dense foliage, it has been much used in landscape gardening, mainly as tall hedges and for topiary. The wood is heavy and hard, and is used for tools and building constructions. It also burns hot and slowly, making it a very suitable firewood. This {{was the reason for}} lopping and hence indirectly the saving of Epping Forest, where the hornbeam was a favoured <b>pollarding</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} to hedge laying is trimming using a tractor-mounted flail cutter or circular saw, or a hedge trimmer [...] The {{height of the}} cutting can be increased a little every year. Trimming a hedge helps to promote bushy growth. If a flail cutter is used, then the flail must be kept sharp {{to ensure that the}} cutting is effective on the hedge. The disadvantage of this is that the hedge species takes a number of years before it will flower again and subsequently bear fruit for wildlife and people. If the hedge is trimmed repeatedly at the same height, a 'hard knuckle' will start to form at that height - similar to the shape of a <b>pollarded</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|R

25|$|The age of {{the forest}} {{and the range of}} {{habitats}} it contains make it a valuable area for wildlife, and it is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Its former status as a working or pasture forest has had a great effect on its ecology. This is particularly evident with the <b>pollarded</b> <b>trees,</b> which, as they have not been cut since the passing of the Epping Forest Act, have now grown massive crowns of thick, trunk-like branches with correspondingly large boles. This gives the trees an unusual appearance, not known in other forests. Often the weight of the branches cannot be supported by the parent tree, and the large amount of dead wood in the forest supports numerous rare species of fungi and invertebrates.|$|R

Using a wide range of both written and artistic sources form the Middle Ages, this article argues that pigs were fed in wood pastures both during the mast season when acorns were available and at other times as grazing fields.

Two apparently opposed trends were found: first, an apparent decrease in the interest of farmers for hedgerows witnessed by the diminishing of the rate of pruning; second, changing attitudes of farmers not necessarily toward hedgerow abandonment but rather toward the production of novel shapes for pruned trees...|$|R

2500|$|Although the Epping Forest Act almost {{certainly}} saved the forest from total destruction, {{it has to}} some extent had a deleterious effect on the area's biodiversity.

[...] In addition, the area surrounding the forest is now to a great extent urbanised; the corresponding reduction in grazing has led to former areas of grassland and heathland being overcome by secondary woodland – this has been exacerbated by the majority of the forest's deer being enclosed to prevent impacts with vehicles on the major roads that run through the forest. In recent years, the Conservators have experimented with pollarding in selected areas of the forest, and a herd of English Longhorn cattle has been reintroduced to graze the heathland and grassland.|$|R
