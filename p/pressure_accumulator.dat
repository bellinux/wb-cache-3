5000|$|In {{common rail}} systems, a {{high-pressure}} pump stores a reservoir of fuel at high pressure — up to and above [...] The term [...] "common rail" [...] refers {{to the fact that}} all of the fuel injectors are supplied by a common fuel rail which {{is nothing more than a}} <b>pressure</b> <b>accumulator</b> where the fuel is stored at high pressure. This accumulator supplies multiple fuel injectors with high-pressure fuel. This simplifies the purpose of the high-pressure pump in that it only needs to maintain a commanded pressure at a target (either mechanically or electronically controlled). The fuel injectors are typically ECU-controlled. When the fuel injectors are electrically activated, a hydraulic valve (consisting of a nozzle and plunger) is mechanically or hydraulically opened and fuel is sprayed into the cylinders at the desired pressure. Since the fuel pressure energy is stored remotely and the injectors are electrically actuated, the injection pressure at the start and end of injection is very near the pressure in the accumulator (rail), thus producing a square injection rate. If the accumulator, pump and plumbing are sized properly, the injection pressure and rate will be the same for each of the multiple injection events.|$|E

50|$|The term 'power {{hydraulic}} brakes' {{can also}} refer to systems operating on very different principles where an engine-driven pump maintains continual hydraulic pressure {{in a central}} accumulator. The driver's brake pedal simply controls a valve to bleed pressure into the brake units at the wheels, rather than actually creating the pressure in a master cylinder by depressing a piston. This form of brake is analogous to an air brake system but with hydraulic fluid as the working medium rather than air. However, on an air brake air is vented from the system when the brakes are released and the reserve of compressed air must be replenished. On a power hydraulic brake system fluid at low pressure is returned from the brake units at the wheels to the engine-driven pump as the brakes are released, so the central <b>pressure</b> <b>accumulator</b> is almost instantly re-pressurised. This makes the power hydraulic system highly suitable for vehicles that must frequently stop and start (such as buses in cities). The continually circulating fluid also removes problems with freezing parts and collected water vapour that can afflict air systems in cold climates. The AEC Routemaster bus is a well-known application of power hydraulic brakes and the successive generations of Citroen cars with hydropneumatic suspension also used fully powered hydraulic brakes rather than conventional automotive brake systems.|$|E

40|$|This {{study focused}} {{on the use of}} fixed {{displacement}} pumps in parallel connection to control the velocity of a multi-chamber cylinder piston. The system’s basic principle was to combine the discrete flow supply control of parallel pumps with the discrete effective area control of a multi-chamber cylinder to produce a speed control resolution high enough for accurate velocity tracking and positioning. Some throttling was used in the return line to control the system with overrunning loads. The properties of the system were tested with a 1 -DOF boom mockup mimicking a medium-sized mobile machine boom. The test system revealed a feature that caused load acceleration to drop when the effective cylinder area was reduced during movement. Additionally, some delay was observed in accelerating the piston against the load force. These two system properties along with the discrete control method resulted in mediocre speed and position tracking in the system when movement was directed against the load force. The system was able to control restricting and overrunning loads as well as a large inertia mass with a low load force.

40|$|The {{objective}} in this Master's Thesis was {{to verify the}} stability criteria for a centrifugal pump. Operation of an unstable pump may lead to either exponential or oscillatory unstable behavior of both pressure and volume flow {{of the water in}} the conduit system. This is of course unwanted, and fulfilling the stability criteria is desirable. The idea is to test an unstable pump, which was done at the Technical University Berlin (TU) in Germany. Most of the test set-up was already installed, but a new pump and a <b>pressure</b> <b>accumulator</b> was inserted. Unfortunately the experiment was not able to verify the stability criteria systematically, because the set-up was a closed loop without reservoirs; and because the different parameters affecting the stability were difficult to change. The experiment was educational even though the stability criteria were not verified. Different tasks were executed at TU, like installing the <b>pressure</b> <b>accumulator</b> and a pressure sensor, and measuring the pump characteristic. The work with the Master's Thesis also improved the candidate's understanding of the stability criteria and the dynamic behavior of the water in general.

Most of the parameters put into Matlab were measured at TU, except the volume of the air inside the <b>pressure</b> <b>accumulator.</b> This volume affects the frequency of the oscillations a lot, but a good estimation of the volume of the air, made the simulations quite similar to the measured results.

40|$|Abstract: A Dynamic Hydromachine Control {{concept is}} {{presented}} here with specific application as a specialized transmission for a heavy vehicle, which would provide such a vehicle with good mobility and good {{ride and handling}} characteristics {{as well as the}} provision of a large torque/speed range which is essential for multi purpose vehicles. Dynamic Hydromachine Control is a term given to a hydrostatic transmission which is subjected to both primary unit dynamic pressure control and secondary unit dynamic speed control, so as to obtain an extremely versatile hydrostatic transmission with unique characteristics. The Dynamic Hydromachine Control concept is realized by a digital Transmission Control Computer and analogue controllers, which interpret the operator/driver inputs and generate control signals for the hydromachines according to a Control Law, which is petrol engine speed dependent. This control strategy ensures that the petrol engine cannot stall (nor overspeed for long periods) and it would also provide a vehicle with handling characteristics similar to those of a conventional vehicle with an automatic transmission. The Control Law may be operated in three main modes, namely those of normal differential action (with limited wheel slip control capability), differential lock action or forced steering action. The Dynamic Hydromachine Control concept has been evaluated on an experimental power train, the hydrostatic transmission of which is to be directly implemented in a technology demonstrator vehicle (at a later stage of the research program). The hydromachines have been dimensioned (in terms of torque and speed) so as to fulfil the functional requirements of the eventual technology demonstrator vehicle. No—load characterisation tests as well as vehicle traction simulation tests were performed on the experimental hydrostatic transmission. It is shown that the system pressure, the high <b>pressure</b> <b>accumulator,</b> and the inertial loads, all have significant influences on the overall dynamic response of the system. The high <b>pressure</b> <b>accumulator</b> which is normally included in a hydraulic circuit where secondary unit speed control is performed, {{has been found to be}} redundant due to the fast and effective dynamic pressure control which is exercised. It is however this controlled variation of system pressure together with the absorbing effect of the high <b>pressure</b> <b>accumulator,</b> which cause pressure oscillations and possible system instability, thus providing further motivation for the omission of the high <b>pressure</b> <b>accumulator</b> from the final hydraulic circuit which is to be implemented in the technology demonstrator vehicle. Apart from these findings, the experimental results prove that the different operational modes of the Control Law, operate successfully under various simulated traction load conditions, thus validating the use of the Dynamic Hydromachine Control concept for multi wheeled heavy vehicles.

40|$|The {{functions}} of the ECCS accumulators are to supply water to the reactor vessel during the blowdown phase of a {{loss of coolant accident}} (LOCA), to provide inventory to help accomplish the refill phase that follows thereafter, and to provide Reactor Coolant System (RCS) makeup for any LOCA that reduces RCS pressure to below the <b>accumulator</b> <b>pressure.</b> The blowdown phase of a large break LOCA is the initial period of the transient during which the RCS departs from equilibrium conditions, and heat from fission product decay, hot internals, and the vessel continues to be transferred to the reactor coolant. The blowdown phase of the transient ends when the RCS pressure falls to a value approaching that of the containment atmosphere. In the refill phase of a LOCA, which immediately follows the blowdown phase, reactor coolant inventory has vacated the core through steam flashing and ejection out through the break. The core is essentially in adiabatic heatup.
