5000|$|Like {{most of the}} {{agreements}} adopted in the Uruguay Round, the DSU contains several provisions directed to developing countries. The Understanding states that members should give [...] "special attention" [...] to the problems and interests of developing country members. Further, if one <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> is a developing country, that party is entitled {{to have at least}} one panelist who comes from a developing country. If a complaint is brought against a developing country, the time for consultations (before a panel is convened) may be extended, and if the dispute goes to a panel, the deadlines for the developing country to make its submissions may be relaxed. Also, the Secretariat is authorized to make a qualified legal expert available to any developing country on request. Formal complaints against least developed countries are discouraged, and if consultations fail, the Director-General and the Chairman of the DSB stand ready to offer their good offices before a formal request for a panel is made. As to substance, the DSU provides that the report of panels shall [...] "explicitly indicate" [...] how account has been taken of the [...] "differential and more favorable treatment" [...] provisions of the agreement under which the complaint is brought. Whether or not a developing country is a party to a particular proceeding, [...] "particular attention" [...] is to be paid to the interests of the developing countries in the course of implementing recommendations and rulings of panels. In order to assist developing countries in overcoming their limited expertise in WTO law and assist them in managing complex trade disputes, an Advisory Centre on WTO Law was established in 2001. The aim is {{to level the playing field}} for these countries and customs territories in the WTO system by enabling them to have a full understanding of their rights and obligations under the WTO Agreement.|$|E
40|$|Katarína Jakabová Abstract ABSTRACT Procedural {{aspects of}} the dispute {{settlement}} in international economic law The dispute settlement in the international economic law of nowadays takes place under more institutionalized mechanism {{as in the past}} half-century. The aim is clear: better enforceability of the law (of the award) based on the fast and efficient "under one roof" procedure. This thesis focuses on the procedural {{aspects of the}} dispute settlement within the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Each of these three organizations has its own special dispute settlement procedure, which is above all distinctive from the international trade law by having at least one (member) state as a <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute.</b> I have chosen WTO because it regulates the disputes on a state-state level arising from all the WTO agreements between all WTO members, which makes it the biggest (and very effective, let's admit) dispute settling platform worldwide. ICSID is the first and most popular mixed arbitration allowing a non-state party (an investor) to be a <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute.</b> And finally, NAFTA, even if it is on a substantial level complementing the WTO agreements, represents their competitive version on the [...] ...|$|E

5000|$|Arbitration, {{a form of}} {{alternative}} dispute resolution (ADR), is <b>a</b> way <b>to</b> resolve <b>disputes</b> outside the courts. The <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> refer it <b>to</b> arbitration, {{which means that the}} dispute will be decided by one or more persons (the [...] "arbitrators", [...] "arbiters" [...] or [...] "arbitral tribunal"), and the <b>parties</b> agree <b>to</b> be bound by the arbitral decision (the [...] "award"). An arbitrator is a third party who reviews the evidence in the case and imposes a decision that is legally binding on both sides and enforceable in the courts.|$|R
25|$|Arbitration, in {{the context}} of United States law, is a form of {{alternative}} <b>dispute</b> resolution—specifically, <b>a</b> legal alternative <b>to</b> litigation whereby the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> agree <b>to</b> submit their respective positions (through agreement or hearing) <b>to</b> <b>a</b> neutral third <b>party</b> (the arbitrator(s) or arbiter(s)) for resolution. In practice arbitration is generally used as a substitute for judicial systems, particularly when the judicial processes are viewed as too slow, expensive or biased. Arbitration is also used by communities which lack formal law, as a substitute for formal law.|$|R

Several decades ago, Martin Luther King Jr., in a groundswell of Gandhian activism, raised that Gandhian understanding of justice {{to a position of}} near dominance in Western thought.

40|$|The {{questions}} when, why, and how {{legal representation}} {{makes a difference}} for parties in civil litigation remain largely unanswered, although recent scholarship raises compelling new questions and suggests new explanations and theoretical approaches. Understanding how legal representation operates, we argue, requires {{an appreciation for the}} context in which the representation actually takes place. This article examines two previously unexplored elements of the context of legal representation through empirical and theoretical analysis: the balance of power between the parties to a dispute and the professional, specifically strategic, expertise that a legal representative contributes. The results of a study of 1, 700 unemployment compensation cases in the District of Columbia’s central administrative court reveal two key findings. First, represented parties have better case outcomes than unrepresented parties, though employers–-the more powerful <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> or the quintessential “haves”-–see less benefit from legal representation than claimants–-the less powerful party or the “have nots. ” Second, represented parties are more likely to use procedures than unrepresented parties. Yet, surprisingly, represented claimants who use certain evidentiary procedures have worse case outcomes than represented claimants who do not use those same procedures. Thus, in attempting to answer the question of when, why, and how legal representation makes a difference, we argue that it depends on who the represented party is, who they are up against, and the expertise the representative brings...|$|E
50|$|Expert {{determination}} is {{a historically}} accepted form of dispute resolution invoked {{when there is}} not <b>a</b> formulated <b>dispute</b> in which the parties have defined positions {{that need to be}} subjected to arbitration, but rather both parties are in agreement {{that there is a need}} for an evaluation. Expert determination is a procedure by which the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> appoint <b>an</b> independent and neutral expert to determine the dispute in private. Like arbitration, it allows trade secrets and other sensitive information to be kept out of the public domain. The expert will be a person with specialist or technical knowledge relevant to the dispute.|$|R
