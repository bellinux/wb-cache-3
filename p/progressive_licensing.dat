40|$|Abstract Network {{meta-analysis}} {{is increasingly}} used to allow comparison of multiple treatment alternatives simultaneously, {{some of which}} may not have been compared directly in primary research studies. The majority of network meta-analyses published to date have incorporated data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) only; however, inclusion of non-randomized studies may sometimes be considered. Non-randomized studies can complement RCTs or address some of their limitations, such as short follow-up time, small sample size, highly selected population, high cost, and ethical restrictions. In this paper, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of incorporating both RCTs and non-randomized comparative cohort studies into network meta-analysis for assessing the safety and effectiveness of medical treatments. Non-randomized studies with inadequate control of biases such as confounding may threaten the validity of the entire network meta-analysis. Therefore, identification and inclusion of non-randomized studies must balance their strengths with their limitations. Inclusion of both RCTs and non-randomized studies in network meta-analysis will likely increase in the future due to the growing need to assess multiple treatments simultaneously, the availability of higher quality non-randomized data and more valid methods, and the increased use of <b>progressive</b> <b>licensing</b> and product listing agreements requiring collection of data over the life cycle of medical products. Inappropriate inclusion of non-randomized studies could perpetuate the biases that are unknown, unmeasured, or uncontrolled. However, thoughtful integration of randomized and non-randomized studies may offer opportunities to provide more timely, comprehensive, and generalizable evidence about the comparative safety and effectiveness of medical treatments...|$|E
40|$|Canada 2 ̆ 7 s linkage regime for pharmaceuticals, {{modeled after}} the {{originating}} U. S. Hatch-Waxman regime, was brought in under intense political pressure to balance effective patent enforcement over new and innovative drugs with the timely market entry of lower-priced generic competitors. It has been almost two decades since the regulations were enacted, and to date, {{there has been little}} objective assessment as to whether the regulations have, in fact, stimulated innovation and timely generic entry. We recently completed three empirical studies on the linkage between drug approval and drug patenting under the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations (NOC Regulations). Of particular interest was the nexus between the innovative character of new and follow-on drugs approved by Canadian regulators and the scope of intellectual property protection afforded to these drugs via operation of linkage regulations. The first study focused on the type of brand-name and generic drug approvals over an eight-year term following the coming into force of the linkage regime and leading up to the debate on <b>progressive</b> <b>licensing</b> of drug products. The second was an analysis of patenting characteristics for therapeutic products before and after the coming into force of the NOC Regulations. That study also involved a detailed analysis of patent and therapeutic classes in which multinational drug companies are focusing their attention and how these can be used to support various types of new and follow-on drug development. The third was a more nuanced analysis of the innovative nature of new and follow-on drugs approved by regulators over this time frame coupled with an investigation into how patent monopoly periods for pharmaceuticals were extended via the linkage regulations. The implications of the data for the vires of pharmaceutical linkage are discussed in light of the stated goals of government to stimulate new and innovative drug development and facilitate timely entry of generic products and, thus, to balance the goals and objectives of food and drug law with those of enabling patent legislation. The Article finishes with {{a brief description of the}} global evolution of pharmaceutical linkage and raises issues for further research into local and global systems of pharmaceutical law and policy...|$|E
40|$|Chickenpox {{infections are}} {{generally}} mild {{but due to}} their very high incidence among healthy children they give rise to considerable morbidity and occasional mortality. With {{the development of a}} varicella vaccine in the early 1970 s and its <b>progressive</b> <b>licensing</b> in many countries, interest in the efficiency of varicella immunisation programmes grew. The objective of this review was to discuss the methodological aspects and results of published economic evaluations of varicella vaccination. From this, we attempted to make recommendations. A computerised search was carried out; 17 full economic evaluations of varicella vaccination were retrieved. The review identified the methodological divergences and similarities between the articles in four areas: study design, epidemiological data, economic data and model characteristics. We assessed to what extent the applied methods conform to general guidelines for the economic evaluation of healthcare interventions and compared the studies' results. The desirability of a universal vaccination programme depends on whose perspective is taken. Despite variability in data and model assumptions, the studies suggest that universal vaccination of infants is attractive to society because large savings occur from averted unproductive days for parents. For the healthcare payer, universal vaccination of infants does not generate savings. Vaccination of susceptible adolescents has been proposed by some authors as a viable alternative; the attractiveness of this is highly dependent on the negative predictive value of anamnestic screening. Targeted vaccination of healthcare workers and immunocompromised individuals appears relatively cost effective. Findings for other target groups are either contradictory or provide insufficient evidence for any unequivocal recommendations to be made. High sensitivity to vaccine price was reported in most studies. This review highlights that some aspects of these studies need to be further improved before final recommendations can be made. First, more transparency, completeness and compliance to general methodological guidelines are required. Second, because of the increasing severity of varicella with age, it is preferable and in some cases essential to use dynamic models for the assessment of universal vaccination strategies. Third, most studies focused on the strategy of vaccinating children only while their results depended heavily on disputable assumptions (regarding vaccine effectiveness and impact on herpes zoster). Since violation of these assumptions could have important adverse public health effects, we suggest pre-adolescent vaccination as a more secure alternative. This option deserves more attention in future analyses. Cost analysis, Immunisation programmes, Pharmacoeconomics, Vaccines, Varicella vaccines, Varicella zoster virus infections...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} about a {{preference}} within contemporary left-wing culture for defining opponents as not belonging rather than seeking to win them over. Opponents are constructed as being outside {{of the community of}} the good or the <b>progressive.</b> This <b>licenses</b> their treatment as ‘other’, impermeable to political argument, reason and evidence. The Corbyn faction in the Labour Party employs an ethic of disdain for ad hominem politics but is keenly concerned with the construction and policing of the boundaries of progressive discourse. This faction’s rise to leadership is symbolic of the prominence of this political culture. As a sort of anti-imperialist ‘campism’ emerges as the pre-eminent principle of the progressive movement, hostility to Israel becomes a key marker of political belonging. This paper examines the Livingstone Formulation, a rhetorical device that seeks to construe the raising of the issue of antisemitism as more suspect and inherently problematic than the phenomenon of antisemitism itself. The construction of opponents of the Israel boycott campaign as external to the community of the University and College Union (UCU) provides case-study material. The conclusion draws on the social critique of the Enlightenment notion of the autonomous rational subject. This critique downplays reason and human agency in social life. It is a development from the notion of false consciousness which facilitates a spiral into what Hannah Arendt (1975) analysed as a central feature of totalitarian politics: a culture in which disagreements are treated as ‘originating in deep natural, social, or psychological sources beyond the control of the individual and therefore beyond the power of reason’...|$|R
