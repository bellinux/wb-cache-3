40|$|The effects <b>of</b> <b>sintering</b> {{temperatures}} on {{the performances}} and durabilities of conventional nickel-yttria-stabilized zirconia composite solid oxide fuel cell anodes were investigated. The anode microstructures after reduction and 100 hours operation were quantitatively analyzed by three-dimensional reconstruction based on focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy technique. <b>Percolation</b> <b>of</b> nickel, yttria-stabilized zirconia and pore phases and three phase boundary densities were quantitatively calculated. The anode sintered at 1450 ◦C {{has been found}} to show the minimum ohmic resistance and polarization resistance. The differences of ohmic resistances between the anodes can be quantitatively explained by the difference of active three phase boundary density. Besides, the anode sintered at 1450 ◦C could operate without large-scale channel cracks which may cause damage and relatively fast degradation. The lowest degradation rate <b>of</b> anode <b>sintered</b> at 1450 ◦C is attributed to the strengthened YSZ network for maintaining Ni phase percolation compared to the other two sintering temperatures...|$|R

40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{and mechanical}} properties <b>of</b> <b>sintered</b> Nd-Fe-B magnets prepared by different sintering processes were investigated. The {{results showed that}} the intrinsic coercivity and fracture toughness <b>of</b> <b>sintered</b> Nd-Fe-B magnets first increased, and then declined with increasing annealing temperature. The optimum magnetic properties and fracture toughness <b>of</b> <b>sintered</b> Nd-Fe-B magnets were obtained at the annealing temperature of 540 degrees C. Sintering temperature increasing from 1047 degrees C to 1071 degrees C had hardly effect on the magnetic properties <b>of</b> <b>sintered</b> Nd-Fe-B magnets. The variation of Vickers hardness and fracture toughness was not the same with increasing sintering temperature, and the effect <b>of</b> <b>sintering</b> temperature on the mechanical properties was complex and irregular. The reasons for the variation on magnetic and mechanical properties were analyzed, and we presumed that the effect of microstructure on the mechanical properties was more sensitive than the magnetic properties through analyzing the microstructure <b>of</b> <b>sintered</b> Nd-Fe-B magnets.

40|$|In this work, {{a double}} coating {{protection}} technique of phosphating treatment and copper plating {{was made to}} improve the corrosion resistance <b>of</b> <b>sintered</b> Nd-Fe-B magnets. In other words, the intergranular region <b>of</b> <b>sintered</b> Nd-Fe-B is allowed to generate passive phosphate conversion coating through phosphating treatment, followed by the copper coating on the surface <b>of</b> <b>sintered</b> Nd-Fe-B. The morphology and corrosion resistance <b>of</b> the phosphated <b>sintered</b> Nd-Fe-B were observed using SEM and electrochemical method respectively. The phosphate conversion coating was formed more preferably on the intergranular region <b>of</b> <b>sintered</b> Nd-Fe-B than on the main crystal region; just after a short time of phosphating treatment, the intergranular region <b>of</b> <b>sintered</b> Nd-Fe-B has been covered by the phosphate conversion coating and the corrosion resistance is significantly improved.
