5|$|The crew took {{advantage}} of both natural and <b>practical</b> <b>light</b> at filming locations. The director sought various approaches to the lighting setups, for example choosing several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. He and the crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light the prostheses depicting the characters' injuries. On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were less visible, citing cinematographer Gordon Willis' technique as the influence.|$|E
25|$|The Lympne Light Aircraft Trials {{were held}} to {{encourage}} the development of <b>practical</b> <b>light</b> aircraft for private ownership, with a strong but not exclusive emphasis on fuel economy. They were held in 1923, 1924 and 1926. Each year saw different restrictions on engine size, framed initially in terms of capacity and then weight. The Daily Mail newspaper provided cash prizes throughout though the initiating donation came from the Duke of Sutherland. The Air Ministry were prize givers in the 1924 event. The trials were held at Lympne in Kent, England.|$|E
25|$|Positive {{experiences}} that had {{gained from the}} earlier Ariel experimental tip jet helicopter had given French aviation company Sud-Ouest {{a strong desire to}} pursue development of a <b>practical</b> <b>light</b> helicopter that would harness this technology. Out of their efforts towards this aim emerged the design of a light twin-seat rotorcraft, which was promptly designated as the S.O.1221 Djinn. While this newer design did not share an identical tip jet system to the Ariel, the type did rely upon the same basic concept of feeding compressed air, which was generated by an onboard pump, to the tips of the vehicle's rotor blades to drive the movement of the blades.|$|E

500|$|In {{line with}} the film's use of {{practical}} locations, the photography and design departments worked together to incorporate <b>practical</b> <b>light</b> sources such as [...] "lots of bare bulbs, lots of primitive fixtures". In the climactic torture scene, filmed in an ancient, windowless prison cell outside of Rabat, they used only diegetic light: two strong torches carried by the actors playing the torturers. It was filmed with three cameras and bounce cards were used to reflect light onto the actors' faces. Just a little smoke was sprayed in to augment the atmosphere but not dull the contrast.|$|E

2500|$|The Western Edison Light Co. {{was founded}} in Chicago in 1882, three years after Edison {{developed}} a <b>practical</b> <b>light</b> bulb. In 1887, Western Edison became the Chicago Edison Co. Insull left General Electric and moved to Chicago in 1892, where he became president of Chicago Edison that year. Chicago Edison was struggling, losing money, until Insull discovered {{a way to make}} it profitable during a Christmas visit to Brighton, England in 1894. [...] To his surprise, he saw that the shops were closed, but every light in them was burning; something that never happened in the US. [...] Finding the head of the town's electric company, he asked him how this could happen and was told the secret to it was not a flat rate bill, but use of a demand metered billing system, measuring not only total power consumption, but a set of rates for low-demand and high-demand electric use times. By 1897, Insull had worked out his formulas enough to offer Chicago electric customers two-tiered electric rates. [...] With the new system, many homeowners found their bills lowered by 32 percent within a year.|$|E

Most {{notably in the}} psychedelic climax of the film, rotating lighting rigs were placed in-front of the camera and actors. The final effect created the illusion of the actors faces transitioning between emotions, and personalities. They would also slowly change their emotions intensifying the effect when synced to each rotation.|$|R
2500|$|Filming {{took place}} between 9 June and 4 September 2008. Locations were used in Leipzig, Lübeck, Michaelisbruch (Dreetz) and Netzow (Plattenburg) and Dassow (Schloss Johannstorf). The choice to make the film {{in black and white}} was based partly on the {{resemblance}} to photographs of the era, but also to create a distancing effect. All scenes were originally shot in color and then altered to black and white. Christian Berger, Haneke's usual director of photography, shot the film in Super 35 using a Moviecam Compact. Before filming started, Berger studied the black-and-white films Ingmar Bergman made with Sven Nykvist as cinematographer. Haneke wanted the environments to be very dark, so many indoor scenes used only <b>practical</b> <b>light</b> sources such as oil lamps and candles. In some of the darkest scenes, where the crew had been forced to add artificial lighting, extra shadows could be removed in the digital post-production which allowed for extensive retouching. The team in Vienna also sharpened objects and facial expressions, and modern details were removed from the images. In the dance scene, where the camera moves in 360 degrees, tiles were added frame by frame to replace the original Eternit roofs. Critic Christian Buß suggested references {{in the name of the}} fictitious village, [...] "Eichwald", to the Nazi Obersturmbannführer Adolf Eichmann and the Buchenwald concentration camp. Eichwald is, however, a common German place name, meaning the [...] "Oak Forest".|$|E

6000|$|But if {{such was}} the dismay of the Conservatives, how shall any writer depict the consternation of the Liberals? If there be a feeling odious to {{the mind of a}} sober, hardworking man, it is the feeling that the bread he has earned is to be taken out of his mouth. The pay, the patronage, the powers, and the {{pleasure}} of Government were all due to the Liberals. [...] "God bless my soul," [...] said Mr. Ratler, who always saw things in a <b>practical</b> <b>light,</b> [...] "we have a larger fighting majority than any party has had since Lord Liverpool's time.

Barrington Erle thought that the whole Liberal party should oppose the measure. Though they were Liberals they were not democrats; nor yet infidels. But when Barrington Erle said this, the great leaders of the Liberal party had not as yet decided on their ground of action.|$|E

6000|$|All {{through the}} next week Walter turned over the subject in his own mind; and the more he thought about it, the more the plan gained in definiteness and {{consistency}} as detail after detail suggested itself to him. First he thought of poison. That was the cleanest and neatest way of managing the thing, he considered; and it involved the least unpleasant consequences. To stick a knife or shoot a bullet into any sentient creature was a horrid and revolting act; {{to put a little}} tasteless powder into {{a cup of coffee and}} let a man sleep off his life quietly was really nothing more than helping him involuntarily to a delightful euthanasia. [...] "I wish any one would do as much for me at his age, without telling me about it," [...] Walter said to himself seriously. But then the chances of detection would be much increased by using poison, and Walter felt it an imperative duty to do nothing which would expose Christina to the shock of a discovery. She would not see the matter in the same <b>practical</b> <b>light</b> as he did; women never do; their morality is purely conventional and a wise man will do nothing on earth to shake it. You cannot buy poison without the risk of exciting question. There remained, then, only shooting or stabbing. But shooting makes an awkward noise, and attracts attention at the moment; so the one thing possible was a knife, unpleasant as that conclusion seemed to all his more delicate feelings.|$|E
6000|$|His only {{books were}} an almanac and an arithmetic, in which last he was {{considerably}} expert. The former {{was a sort}} of cyclopaedia to him, which he supposed to contain an abstract of human knowledge, as indeed it does to a considerable extent. I loved to sound him on the various reforms of the day, and he never failed to look at them in the most simple and <b>practical</b> <b>light.</b> He had never heard of such things before. Could he do without factories? I asked. He had worn the home-made Vermont gray, he said, and that was good. Could he dispense with tea and coffee? Did this country afford any beverage beside water? He had soaked hemlock leaves in water and drank it, and thought that was better than water in warm weather. When I asked him if he could do without money, he showed the convenience of money {{in such a way as}} to suggest and coincide with the most philosophical accounts of the origin of this institution, and the very derivation of the word pecunia. If an ox were his property, and he wished to get needles and thread at the store, he thought it would be inconvenient and impossible soon to go on mortgaging some portion of the creature each time to that amount. He could defend many institutions better than any philosopher, because, in describing them as they concerned him, he gave the true reason for their prevalence, and speculation had not suggested to him any other. At another time, hearing Plato's definition of a man--a biped without feathers--and that one exhibited a cock plucked and called it Plato's man, he thought it an important difference that the knees bent the wrong way. He would sometimes exclaim, [...] "How I love to talk! By George, I could talk all day!" [...] I asked him once, when I had not seen him for many months, if he had got a new idea this summer. [...] "Good Lord"--said he, [...] "a man that has to work as I do, if he does not forget the ideas he has had, he will do well. May be the man you hoe with is inclined to race; then, by gorry, your mind must be there; you think of weeds." [...] He would sometimes ask me first on such occasions, if I had made any improvement. One winter day I asked him if he was always satisfied with himself, wishing to suggest a substitute within him for the priest without, and some higher motive for living. [...] "Satisfied!" [...] said he; [...] "some men are satisfied with one thing, and some with another. One man, perhaps, if he has got enough, will be satisfied to sit all day with his back to the fire and his belly to the table, by George!" [...] Yet I never, by any manoeuvring, could get him to take the spiritual view of things; the highest that he appeared to conceive of was a simple expediency, such as you might expect an animal to appreciate; and this, practically, is true of most men. If I suggested any improvement in his mode of life, he merely answered, without expressing any regret, that it was too late. Yet he thoroughly believed in honesty and the like virtues.|$|E
