40|$|Group A {{streptococcus}} (GAS) {{is synonymous}} with Streptococcus pyogenes, the only species within this group of β-hemolytic streptococci. GAS {{is one of the}} leading pathogenic bacteria that infects children and adolescents, and is associated with a wide spectrum of infections and disease states. Worldwide, there are estimated to be> 600 million cases of GAS pharyngitis (“strep throat”) and> 100 million cases of GAS pyoderma annually. 1 Although uniformly susceptible to penicillin and still exquisitely susceptible to many other antimicrobial agents, GAS infections continue to present formidable clinical and public health challenges. The vast majority of GAS infections are of short duration and are relatively benign; however, invasive disease can be fulminant and life-threatening. In addition, GAS differs from other pyogenic bacteria in their potential to produce delayed, nonsuppurative sequelae (e. g., <b>poststreptococcal</b> acute <b>glomerulonephritis</b> (PSAGN) and acute rheumatic fever (ARF)) following uncomplicated infections. The importance of GAS infections in the United States was reinforced at the close of the 20 th century by a resurgence of ARF 2 as well as by the appearance of severe invasive GAS infections (e. g., streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and necrotizing fasciitis) with high morbidity and mortality. 3 On the global scale, GAS is an important cause of morbidity and mortality primarily in developing countries, with> 500, 000 deaths annually. ...|$|R
40|$|Strains of M-type 12 streptococci from 18 {{patients}} with acute glomerulonephritis and 18 {{patients with}} uncomplicated pharyngitis were analyzed for in vitro produc-tion of streptolysin 0, diphosphopyridine nucleotidase, hyaluronidase, streptoki-nase, streptolysin S, proteinase, hyaluronic acid, and fibrinogen-precipitating factor. In addition, relations to blood group antigens, lysogeny, and susceptibility to bac-teriophage were determined. No {{significant differences were}} found between strains from nephritic and nonnephritic patients. By not indicating a role in the pathogene-sis of <b>poststreptococcal</b> acute <b>glomerulonephritis</b> for any of the factors studied, these observations diminish the probability that these factors are of specific importance in this disease and thus direct our attention elsewhere. lVI-type 12 (M- 12) streptococci have been isolat-ed more often than all other Mvprotein types from the throats of patients with. acute glomeru-lonephritis (AGN) associated with respiratory infections in temperate areas [1 - 3]. Conversely, very few M- 12 streptococcal infections are fol-lowed by AGN [4, 5]. Thus, certain strains of M- 12 streptococci may differ from the majority in some way that leads to AGN in patients infected with those particular strains. The frequent occurrence of AGN in several members of one family sup-ports this concept of peculiarly nephritogenic strains within a single M protein-type (often M- 12). For many years we have collected strepto-cocci from patients with AGN or uncomplicated pharyngitis in Chicago.

We attempted to localize anti-IgG in the kidneys of 22 patients who had renal biopsies performed 7 to 66 days after the onset of acute <b>poststreptococcal</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> (APSGN). In addition to routine localization of immunoglobulins and C 3, specimens were stained with neuraminidase-treated, heat-aggregated, and unmodified IgG. Twelve biopsies showed staining with fluorescein-labeled human neuraminidase-treated IgG. A lesser number gave positive staining with the other IgG preparations. Following treatment of slides with 0. 01 M citrate buffer, seven previously negative biopsies showed positive staining with neuraminidase-treated IgG. The demonstration of anti-IgG by these methods was possible in 19 out of 22 biopsies. It correlated best {{with the presence of}} C 3 and IgG, {{and to a lesser extent}} with IgM, in the renal glomerulus. These results and our previous finding of elevated levels of serum anti-IgG early in the course of APSGN, and as early as 8 days following the antecedent streptococcal infection, support a role for anti-IgG in the immune pathogenesis of APSGN.
