40|$|The pejibaye, Bactris gasipaes H. B. K., is an {{important}} fruit common {{in some areas of}} the American Tropics and unknown in others. It is a palm native to South American forests, and was introduced to Central America in pre-Columbian times, but is still seldom found in the Caribbean and other tropical areas. The palm has several spiny trunks that each bear several multifruited panicles yearly. The fruits contain a single seed. The trees are usually propagated from seeds, but better techniques are needed to preserve selected trees as clones. The trees are adapted {{to a wide variety of}} tropical soils and climates, and so far, few important diseases have been found. When mature, the fruits are harvested by a variety of techniques, none of which is very satisfactory. Harvested fruit is easily damaged and damaged fruits rot rapidly. Mature fruits are boiled, and the pulp is eaten fresh, made into a meal, or macerated to make a drink. The seed is also edible. The <b>palm</b> <b>cabbage</b> is also harvested, usually from old trunks that are being removed anyway.

50|$|Pieces of 7,000- to 8,000-year-old fabric {{have been}} found with human burials at the Windover Archaeological Site in Florida. The burials were in a peat pond. The fabric had turned into peat, but was still identifiable. Many bodies at the site had been wrapped in fabric before burial. Eighty-seven pieces of fabric were found {{associated}} with 37 burials. Researchers have identified seven different weaves in the fabric. One kind of fabric had 26 strands per inch (10 strands per centimeter). There were also weaves using two-strand and three-strand wefts. A round bag made from twine was found, as well as matting.

5000|$|Nests of M. mexicanus {{have been}} {{observed}} on saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), <b>cabbage</b> <b>palm</b> (Sabal palmetto), oak trees, Spanish moss, and human constructions.

However, {{it has been found}} that M. mexicanus nests are often constructed on the eastern-facing side of palm fronds, probably because this orientation increases the activity of the nest early in the day, {{as a consequence of the}} increased luminance and temperature. It was also found that foundresses preferred the outside curl of palm fronds over the inside curl [...] and that the <b>cabbage</b> <b>palm</b> may provide greater protection against birds than other habitats.|$|R
