Although the Kumeyaay “offered allegiance”, they were {{directed}} by US forces {{to stay out of the}} conflict.

500|$|On July 3, 1986, the First Circuit Court of Appeals {{upheld the}} {{contempt}} of court fines from the Boston grand jury. That decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which let it stand. [...] The First Circuit Court heard an appeal on September 11, 1987, alleging abuse {{of the grand jury}} and denied it six days later. On November 3, 1987, six organizations affiliated with LaRouche argued that their documents were seized improperly during the October 1986 search. The court denied the appeal the following January. Jeffrey Steinberg said on December 11, 1987, that 100 notebooks compiled by himself and his wife should not have been included in the grand jury subpoena or the search. He lost that appeal the following January. The court heard an appeal from NBC on January 5, 1988, over a lower court subpoena of NBC outtakes of a videotaped interview with a witness, Forrest Lee Fick. The lower court ruled the subpoenaed outtakes were to be <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> <b>seal</b> and subject to in camera review only, giving the court discretion whether to release any portion to the defendants. [...] LaRouche had asserted the outtakes could be used to impeach Fick's testimony. [...] The court affirmed the lower court's ruling in March.|$|R

40|$|The SRB {{attach ring}} is {{thermally}} protected with layered phenolic cloth fairings that are {{fastened to the}} ring. The gap between the fairings and the motor case is closed off with a rubber seal of a fishtail cross sectional shape bonded to the phenolic. On both the STS- 1 and STS- 2 flights this gap was discovered to vary anywhere from an intended gap of 0. 375 in. to an actual measured gap of 0. 60 in. due to tolerances. Tests were conducted with and without a 0. 25 in. thick cork shim <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> the <b>seal</b> with a 0. 60 in. gap under the phenolic TPS to determine and compare {{the performance of the}} seal in the two different configurations. To alleviate the difficult and costly procedure of installing the cork shim <b>under</b> the <b>seal,</b> especially after phenolic TPS mounting on the attach ring, large fishtail seals of idential Elder gray silicon material and two different hardnesses were tested. A similar matrix of tests was conducted with this new large fishtail seal, and seals with both type hardnesses performed well {{regardless of whether or not}} the seal was bonded in the phenolic at the front of the seal groove. Similar results had been obtained with the original small fishtail seal which performed adequately with the 0. 25 in. cork shim under it...|$|R
5000|$|As {{part of its}} {{investigation}} into the conduct of UBS’s US cross-border business, DOJ demanded client banking records from UBS. Under Swiss bank secrecy laws, UBS was prohibited from turning over such documents. The Swiss government interceded and began negotiating with DOJ {{in an effort to}} persuade DOJ to stop trying to force UBS to violate Swiss law. On November 6, 2008, a U.S. federal grand jury indicted Raoul Weil in connection with the ongoing investigation of UBS, and DOJ obtained an order from the court there <b>placing</b> the indictment <b>under</b> <b>seal.</b> On November 10, 2008, Swiss Finance Minister Hans-Rudolf Merz and Head of the Swiss Federal Department of Justice and Police Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulsen asking that DOJ go through the information-sharing provisions of the US-Switzerland Double Taxation Treaty if it wanted to obtain information regarding UBS’s clients. Weil’s indictment was unsealed two days later, on November 12, 2008. According to one high-level Swiss source, “that was a clear message [...] [...] [...] One can imagine that without the letter they would have at least delayed the indictment of Weil.” ...|$|R
