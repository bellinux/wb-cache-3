40|$|In {{a medium}} where {{positronium}} (Ps) is formed, a lowering {{of the electron}} density at the positron <b>position</b> (<b>contact</b> density) {{with respect to a}} vacuum is generally observed. The effect is usually attributed to the interaction with the medium, which induces Ps polarization. The contact density reduction, explainable in polar media due to Debye forces, can be expected also in non-polar media, where London forces are present. To investigate this subject we measured the Ps contact density in ferrocene, an organometallic compound whose molecule does not have an intrinsic dipole moment; therefore, only induced dipole-induced dipole interactions may be present. Contact density was obtained by means of two different experimental techniques. A lowering by 23 % with respect to vacuum value was observed, which allowed us a simple estimation of the order of magnitude of the effective microscopic electric field mimicking the Ps-ferrocene interaction...|$|E

40|$|Wettability and {{hydrophobicity}} of coal {{surfaces are}} technologically important but their accurate determination {{as a function}} of coal composition still remains a challenge. In this paper, a new experimental methodology has been developed to characterize coal surface hydrophobicity. This methodology combines the assessment of the extent of the surface heterogeneity by semiautomated petrography and image analysis, with contact angle measurements, using the axi-symmetric drop shape analysis technique. The measured distribution of petrographic components of macerals and minerals and their fractional areas on the coal surface where contact angles had been measured were correlated with the contact angle measured at that <b>position.</b> <b>Contact</b> angles for vitrinite and minerals were estimated independently, and those of the finely dispersed inertinite and liptinite were estimated from the contact angles of the heterogeneous surfaces and the fractional areas of the maceral and mineral components via Cassies equation. The established link between the discrete petrographic components that define the coal heterogeneity and the coal surface hydrophobicity is significant for estimating the hydrophobicity of composite coal particles and for predicting the performance of the flotation process which is used for cleaning fine coal particles. © 2010 American Chemical Society...|$|E

Methods: This study consisted of 32 subjects (19 females, 13 males) {{with a mean age}} of 25 years, referred for surgical intervention of 39 maxillary impacted canines. Initial 2 D panoramic radiography was available, and 3 D cone beam CT imaging was obtained upon clinical indication. Both 2 D and 3 D pre-operative radiographic diagnostic sets were subsequently analysed by six observers. Perioperative evaluations were conducted by the treating surgeon. McNemar tests, hierarchical logistic regression and linear mixed models were used to explore the differences in evaluations between imaging modalities. Results: Significantly higher confidence levels were observed for 3 D image-based treatment plans than for 2 D image-based plans (p[*]<[*] 0. 001).

40|$|International audienceSelf-assembly of {{core-shell}} nanoparticles (NPs) at liquid-liquid interfaces {{is rapidly}} {{emerging as a}} strategy {{for the production of}} novel nano-materials bearing vast potential for applications, including membrane fabrication, drug delivery and emulsion stabilization. The development of such nanoparticle-based materials is facilitated by structural characterization techniques that are able to monitor in situ the self-assembly process during its evolution. Here, we present an in situ high-energy X-ray reflectivity study of the evolution of the vertical <b>position</b> (<b>contact</b> angle) and inter-particle spacing of core-shell iron oxide-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) nanoparticles adsorbing at flat, horizontal buried water-n-decane interfaces. The results are compared with time-resolved interfacial tension data acquired with the conventional pendant drop method. We investigate in particular the effect of varying polymer molecular weights (25 kDa) and architectures (linear vs. dendritic) on the self-assembly process and the final structure of the interfacially adsorbed NP monolayers. Linear PEG particles adsorb more rapidly than dendritic PEG ones and reach full interface coverage and stable NP monolayer structure, while dendritic PEG particles undergo a slower adsorption process, which is not completed within the experimental time window of similar to 6 hours. All NPs are highly hydrophilic with effective contact angles that depend weakly on PEG molecular weight and architecture. Conversely, the in-plane NP separation depends strongly on PEG molecular weight. The measured inter-particle separation at full interface coverage yields low iron oxide core content, indicating a strong deformation and flattening of the linear PEG shell at the interface. This finding is supported by modeling and has direct implications for materials fabrication, e. g. for the realization of core-shell NP membranes by in situ cross-linking of the polymer shell...|$|E

We aimed to explore the dynamic of first-time HIV testing in France for sub-Saharan migrants after their arrival. ANRS-Parcours is a retrospective life-event survey conducted from 2012 to 2013 in healthcare facilities in the Paris region, among 926 sub-Saharan HIV-infected migrants and 763 non-infected migrants. After describing the time to first HIV test in France and associated circumstances, we performed a discrete-time logistic regression to analyze the influence of socioeconomic <b>position,</b> <b>contact</b> with the healthcare system and sexual behaviors, on first-time HIV testing in France in migrants who arrived after 2000. Median first-time HIV testing occurred during the second year spent in France for non-infected men and women in both groups, and during the first year for men of the HIV group. The probability of testing increased with hospitalization and pregnancy for women of both groups. For non-infected men unemployment and absence of a residence permit were associated with an increased probability of HIV testing [respectively, OR = 2. 2 (1. 2 - 4. 1) and OR = 2. 0 (1. 1 - 3. 5) ]. Unemployment was also associated with an increased probability of first-time HIV-testing for women of the HIV group [OR: 1. 7 (1. 0 - 2. 7) ]. Occasional and multiple sexual relationships were associated with an increased probability of first-time testing only for HIV-infected women [OR: 2. 2 (1. 2 - 4. 0) and OR = 2. 4 (1. 3 - 4. 6) ]. Access to first HIV testing in France is promoted by contact with the health care system and is facilitated for unemployed and undocumented migrants after arrival. However, testing should be offered more systematically and repeated in order to reduce time between HIV infection and diagnosis, especially for deprived people which are particularly vulnerable regarding HIV infection...|$|E

40|$|Light {{touch of}} the index finger with a {{stationary}} surface at non-mechanically supportive force levels (< 100 g) greatly attenuates the body sway of standing subjects. In three experiments, we evaluated the properties of finger contact and of the contacted object necessary to produce postural stabilization in subjects standing heel-to-toe with eyes closed, {{as well as how}} accurately hand position can be controlled. Experiment 1 involved finger contact with flexible filaments of different bending strengths, a flat surface, and an imagined spatial <b>position.</b> <b>Contact</b> with the flat surface was most effective in attenuating sway; the flexible filaments were much less effective but still significantly better than imagined contact. Experiment 2 compared the effectiveness of finger contact with a flexible filament, a rigid filament of the same diameter, a flat surface, and an imagined spatial position. The rigid filament and flat surface conditions were equally effective in attenuating body sway and were greatly superior to contact with the flexible filament, which was superior to imagined contact. Experiment 3 included five conditions: arms by sides; finger "contact" with an imagined spatial position; finger contact with a flat surface; finger contact with a flexible filament attempting to maintain it bent; and contact with the flexible filament attempting not to bend it. The arms by sides and finger "contact" with an imagined position conditions did not differ significantly; all three conditions involving actual finger contact showed significantly less center of pressure and hand sway, but contact with the flat surface was most effective in attenuating both postural and hand displacement. In all three experiments, the level of force applied in fingertip contact conditions was far below that necessary to provide mechanical stabilization. Our findings indicate that: (1) stimulation of a small number of receptors in the fingertip is adequate to allow stabilization of sway, (2) fingertip force levels as low as 5 - 10 g provide some stabilization, (3) contact with a stationary spatial referent is most effective, and (4) independent control of arm and torso occurs when finger contact is allowed...|$|E
40|$|Objective. In {{this study}} an {{experimental}} set-up for measuring skin microvascular {{responses of the}} footsole to changes in externally applied pressure was analysed. Design. A clinical study. Skin microvascular blood flow was measured in healthy volunteers, during and after external mechanical pressure of different magnitudes. Background. During standing and walking the footsole is commonly exposed to high static and dynamic mechanical pressure, resulting in changes in the microcirculation of the footsole. In diabetic patients a disturbed interaction between externally applied pressure and skin microvascular response seems {{to be involved in}} the development of a foot ulcer. Methods. Eleven volunteers participated in the study. Static loads were applied to the heel part of the footsole with the person in a supine <b>position.</b> <b>Contact</b> pressure and skin blood flux, based on the laser Doppler technique, were simultaneously monitored. The pressure used was varied in five discrete steps between 10 and 160 kPa and applied during a period of 5 min each. The microcirculation was measured during as well as after pressure loading. Results. Pressures of 40 kPa and higher do stop the blood flow in the skin micro-circulation. Releasing the applied pressure resulted in a hyperaemic response. This response appears to increase in amplitude at increasing pressures up to 800 % of the baseline laser Doppler fluxmetry level. Beyond a pressure level of 80 kPa the hyperaemic response seems not to be influenced by the pressure level. The time needed to achieve the maximal laser Doppler fluxmetry level decreased when the pressure was raised from 10 to 80 kPa, but increased again when higher pressures were applied (P = 0. 051). An intra-individual variation of 11 - 50 % was observed for the parameters describing the blood flux before, during, and after pressure application. Conclusion. Simultaneously measuring changes in contact pressure and laser Doppler flux of the footsole is a useful method to study the interaction of external mechanical pressure and skin microvascular reactions. Pressures above 40 kPa stop skin microvascular blood flow. Releasing the applied pressure results in a hyperaemic response, which increases when the applied pressure increases from 40 to 80 kPa. Higher pressures do not influence the amplitude in skin microvascular response, but result in a longer delay to maximal hyperaemia...|$|E

Curs: 2013 / 2014 In this Master thesis I {{will explain}} how {{companies}} can {{stay on the}} Internet {{and how they can}} offer their services and products on the internet using several tools and software system which are accessible to all and even, most of them are completely free. For this purpose, I will focus on the growing that this company Tecnica & Color can get through internet. I realised my internships for the Master Degree in English Language for international Trade in Tecnica & Color is located in Artana (Castellón). The market of this business is divided between domestic and international market and both of them have the same importance. This company was founded in 2010, so it is a young company that at the beginning it was located in Quart de Poblet (Valencia) but in 2012. The company moved its offices and warehouse to Artana. I was in the export department and I was in contact with all customers all over the world. When customers email us, I realized that in firm of their emails they always included their names, their <b>position,</b> <b>contact</b> and also their URL of their website. Despite the fact that we did not write our URL on the mail, it is printed in all documents that we sent to the customers. But if the customers click on this URL, the corporative web direction was not available. The message was work in progress. There is only one way in which people or future customers can know something about our company. It is when a customer had informed other people about the company because nobody can find this company on the internet. Without the presence of the internet, firm can find new customers through to the international fairs, the salesman or the various contacts that headquarter has had during last years. It could be a good option, maybe it is enough for some companies but I believe that if a company has a good website where it shows its products and its activity, it will have more impact on the chemical products field. For these reasons, I would propose a better use of the internet by developing a good marketing plan. Being the international market so important for a company, they can increase their presence on the internet and it will be developed with a marketing online plan. For this thesis, I will explain the different parts of the marketing online and thanks to the different information available in numerous projects, articles or books about this topic. This thesis has the following main point. Firstly, I will explain the correct meaning of marketing online and the parts that it is composed of. Moreover, I will show its importance in comparison with other kind of marketing strategy. Secondly, the different aspects and elements that companies can use in order to develop this marketing online, such as the creation of a company webpage, the importance of the social networks in order to find new people who know something about the company, then how companies can catch the attention of these new people through the creation of newsletter. All this information will be applied {{in the creation of a}} webpage and a newsletter system where I will put all knowledge about the marketing online and I will try to put all elements in order to be useful for the company that I have mentioned previously. This is my main purpose in this thesis, applying the theoretical knowledge in the creation of an online structure composed by a webpage, the presence of the company in the social network and the creation of newsletter in order to publish its products to the target market. 3.

The <b>position</b> of the <b>contact</b> center (classical binary approach: each center assigned, 1, or not, 0, to a given structure) and of the contact in its dimension (contact membership concept: membership degree, ordinal values from 0 to 1, assigned to each anatomic structure according to extent of involvement) were compared for the whole patient group and, individually, for each patient. ResultsThe membership concept revealed that for 13 out of 20 contacts, more than one structure was involved, where the classical binary approach assigned only one structure.

Spec ifically silicon solar cells are of great pra ctical interest as they presently have a dominant¨ market <b>position.</b> <b>Contact</b> recombination curren ts are one of the major power loss mechanisms in c ertain types of high efficiency silicon solar ¨cells, for example interdigitated back conta ct silicon solar cells featuring diffused junction s.

However,¨ the characterization of contact recombination ¨losses is convoluted, and many present techn ologies forthe characterization of contact recombi nation currents are imperfect. This provided¨ the incentive for this work on a novel charac terization method for contact recombination curren ts. The characterization method developed in¨ this dissertation is based on photo conductancemeasurements on lattices of point contacts on o therwise passivated wafers. Chapt er one features a general introduction. This inclu des a discussion the context in which this di ssertation is performed is performed. Then, v arious sources of efficiency loss in solar cells a rediscussed. The focus is on silicon solar ce lls, and Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC) silicon solar cells in particular. Finally, varioust ypes of passivated contacts are discussed. In chapter two, an introduction to carrie r recombination in silicon solar cells is pro vided. Chapter two also features an introduction t o radio-wave detected quasi steady state phot o conductance (QSSPC) measurements. QSSPC mea surements lie at the basis of the characterization ¨method for contact recombination measurement s which is developed in this dissertation. The result of chapter two is a mathematical framewor k for a number of basic concepts in the field ¨of silicon solar cells, and particularly in the f ield of silicon solar cell characterization. In chapter three, an overview of contem porary methods for contact recombination curr ent measurements is given, and it is argued why th e developmentof a novel method for contact re combination measurements is desirable. This m ethod is subsequently described in detail. This de tailed description covers the physics that li es at the basis of the method. It also covers ¨design rules, error analysis, parasitic effects,¨ and experimental results. The focus is on tes t structures based on lattices of point contacts,but at the end of chapter three, alternative¨ test structure embodiments are described. In chapter four, point contact based test¨ structures are applied to the optimization of ¨n+ diffusions which are used as back surface ¨fields (BSF) in interdigitated back contact (IBC) ¨silicon solar cells. In addition, various fr ont surface field oxidations are investigated. The ¨use of the test structure developed in chapt er three for a classical junction optimizationproblem allows for further experimental confirma tion of the characterization method. Certainl y, the consistency of the trends observed between¨ contact resistance, contact saturation curren t density and saturation current density of p assivated junctions is a strong experimental confi rmation of the novel characterization method¨ described in this dissertation. I n the final chapter, thin dielectric Al 2 O 3 la yers grown using thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) are investigated for the passivation of¨ the interface between aluminum contacts and n+ orp+ silicon. Specific attention is paid to the ¨effect of specific surface treatments prior¨ to the formation of Al 2 O 3 contact passivation ¨layers: ALD Al 2 O 3 contact passivation layerson HF-last and HNO 3 -last silicon are investigated. ALD Al 2 O 3 contact passivation layers arefound to effectively passivate aluminum contactson n+ silicon surfaces, but they are found to be¨ ineffective at passivating aluminum contacts¨ on p+ silicon surfaces. In addition, it is fo und that pin-holesassociated with HF-last ALD Al 2 O 3 contact passivation layers can improve the¨ trade-off between contact resistance and cont act recombination associated with passivated conta cts. However, the reproducibility of pinhole¨ formation in ALD Al 2 O 3 contacts remains an op en question. Acknowledgements	v Abstract	viii Nederlandse samenvatting	x Table of contents	xii 1.

As cars exited the pits, {{previous}} race leader Townsend Bell attempting to gain <b>position</b> <b>contacted</b> with Hélio Castroneves, sending Bell into a spin that collected Ryan Hunter-Reay. Bell and Hunter-Reay would both fall off the lead lap due to the incident, while Castroneves was not greatly affected.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} abnormalities of the first three steps of gait initiation in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with freezing of gait (FOG). Ten PD patients with FOG and 10 age-matched healthy controls performed self-generated gait initiation. The center of pressure (COP), heel <b>contact</b> <b>positions,</b> and spatiotemporal parameters were estimated from the vertical pressures on the surface of the force platform. The initial swing side of gait initiation was consistent among the trials in healthy controls but not among the trials in PD patients. The COP and the heel <b>contact</b> <b>position</b> deviated to the initial swing side during the first step, and the COP passed medial to each heel <b>contact</b> <b>position</b> during the first two steps in PD patients. Medial deviation of the COP from the first heel <b>contact</b> <b>position</b> had significant correlation with FOG questionnaire item 5. These findings indicate that weight shifting between the legs is abnormal and that medial deviation of the COP from the first heel <b>contact</b> <b>position</b> sensitively reflects the severity of FOG during the first three steps of gait initiation in PD patients with FOG...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a novel integrated {{system that is}} composed of a fingerprint sensor and a force sensor to measure <b>contact</b> <b>position</b> and orientation of the fingertip along with the contact force. The system uses fingerprints from the fingerprint sensor to identify the <b>contact</b> <b>position</b> and orientation with fingerprint features such as core point and ridge orientations. The <b>contact</b> <b>position</b> and orientation are represented in a fingerpad coordinate system for grasping studies. An experiment {{has been designed to}} evaluate the proposed system in terms of accuracy and resolution with three subjects. The proposed system can be used in human grasping studies to characterize the fingerpad contact. I...|$|R
