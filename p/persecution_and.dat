5|$|A {{study of}} the {{southern}} carmine bee-eater in Zimbabwe showed that it was affected by deliberate interference and <b>persecution</b> <b>and</b> loss of woodlands, and that nesting sites are lost though poor water management leading to river bank damage, dam construction and panning for gold.

The well-studied European bee-eater is trapped and shot on migration in countries bordering the Mediterranean, an estimated 4,000–6,000 annually being killed in Cyprus alone, but with a global population of between 170,000 and 550,000 pairs even losses on that scale make little overall impact.|$|E

5|$|Ethnocentrism, tribalism, {{religious}} <b>persecution,</b> <b>and</b> prebendalism {{have affected}} Nigerian politics both prior and subsequent to independence in 1960.

Nationalism has also led to active secessionist movements such as MASSOB, Nationalist movements such as Oodua Peoples Congress, Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta and a civil war. Nigeria's three largest ethnic groups (Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba) have maintained historical preeminence in Nigerian politics; competition amongst these three groups has fuelled corruption and graft.|$|E
