This paper reports the physical and mechanical parameters of Salix viminalis L. (<b>purple</b> <b>osier),</b> Salix x rubens Schrank (basket willow), Salix purpurea Linn√© (purple willow) and Salix sp., cultivated in the Canoas River Valley, in the Serra Catarinense region of the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The evaluations were conducted with raw material, the most commonly used format in handcrafts, and the results indicate there are differences in physical and mechanical properties among the species. Salix viminalis and Salix purpurea were similar in density and in their modulus of elasticity, and had higher values of tensile and strength modulus than Salix x rubens and Salix sp...|$|E
