40|$|Under normal conditions, the {{intestinal}} epithelial cells produce constitutive {{amount of heat}} shock proteins (Hsps) that are elevated following stressful stimuli. As the intestine is constantly exposed to variety of agents like diet, normal flora, infectious microorganisms, chemicals, and immune mediators, the expression of Hsps by {{the intestinal}} epithelial cells is therefore, multifactorial and the protective mechanisms are variable. The latter include restoration of unfolded or aggregated polypeptides to their native conformations, proteolysis of proteins too damaged to refold, assembly of proteins, translocation of proteins across membranes, stabilization of cell cytoskeleton and subsequent inhibition of pathogenic invasion, inactivation of intracellular parasites and prevention of persistent production of inflammatory cytokines that would otherwise lead to tissue damage. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the various protective mechanisms of Hsps to the intestinal epithelium using Caco- 2 cell model. The general experimental set up involved induction of Hsps production followed by a challenge with infectious Salmonella enteritidis. Hsps were mainly induced by thermal stress (42 °C for 1 hr followed by 6 hr of recovery) and measured by immunostaining of Western blots. Protection against Salmonella infection was studied by assessing the levels of interleukin (IL) 8 that was measured by ELISA. In some experiments, Hsps were induced by fermentation <b>products</b> of <b>gut</b> flora such as butyrate and spent culture supernatants of lactobacilli. Results showed that the induced Hsps in various conditions did protect the cells against Salmonella enteritidis by suppressing the production of IL- 8, which if it persists, causes tissue damage. It was interesting to note in one of the experiments that Hsps could also be induced following Salmonella enteritidis infection but not after exposure of the cells to its endotoxin. This phenomenon was linked with the stabilization of cell cytoskeleton and subsequent inhibition of invasion. However, it was observed that the induced Hsps could not benefit cells against Salmonella invasion. In addition to the production of Hsps, the fermentation <b>products</b> of <b>gut</b> flora (formate, propionate, and butyrate) were found to selectively and differentially modulate the growth characteristics, cellular metabolism, and differentiation of enterocyte-like Caco- 2 cells in a concentration- and carbon atom-related fashion. Butyrate, with the highest number of carbon atom, was the most potent to induce markers of differentiation namely the transepithelial resistance and sucrase isomaltase. While it is known that cells may become considerably resistant to pathogenic invasion following differentiation, especially after induction of transepithelial resistance, in our study, the induced transepithelial resistance could not protect cells against Salmonella enteritidis invasion. It is concluded that the gut flora and their fermentation products play an important role in the protection of the intestinal epithelium. The protection is, at least in part, mediated by the production of Hsps. The mechanisms of Hsps in this protection include suppression of persistent production of inflammatory cytokines like IL- 8 that would otherwise cause tissue damage and stabilization of barrier integrity and the subsequent inhibition of pathogenic invasion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Certain urinary {{metabolites}} are the <b>product</b> of <b>gut</b> microbial or mammalian metabolism; others, such as hippurate, are mammalian-microbial 'co-metabolites'. It {{has previously}} been observed that Crohn's disease (CD) patients excrete significantly less hippurate than controls. There are two stages in the biosynthesis of this metabolite: 1) gut microbial metabolism of dietary aromatic compounds to benzoate, and 2) subsequent hepatorenal conjugation of benzoate with glycine, forming hippurate. Differences in such urinary co-metabolites may therefore reflect systemic consequences of altered gut microbial metabolism, though altered host metabolic pathways may also be involved. Methods It was hypothesised that reduced hippurate excretion in CD patients was due to alterations in the gut microbiota, and not differences in dietary benzoate, nor defective host enzymatic conjugation of benzoate. 5 mg/kg sodium benzoate were administered orally to 16 CD patients and 16 healthy controls on a low-benzoate diet. Baseline and peak urinary hippurate excretion were measured. Results Baseline hippurate levels were significantly lower in the CD patients (p = 0. 0009). After benzoate ingestion, peak urinary levels of hippurate {{did not differ significantly}} between the cohorts. Consequently the relative increase in excretion was significantly greater in CD (p = 0. 0007). Conclusions Lower urinary hippurate levels in CD are not due to differences in dietary benzoate. A defect in the enzymatic conjugation of benzoate in CD has been excluded, strongly implicating altered gut microbial metabolism as the cause of decreased hippurate levels in CD. </p...|$|R

On the other hand, the country is a leading producer of grains and has the third largest animal feed industry in the world, which has added 5. 5 million hectares of freshwater reservoirs and 3. 5 million km 2 of an exclusive marine economic zone in the same period, a sizable potential for development of the aquaculture industry. This study aims at unveiling strategies for the reduction of the deficit in the Brazilian seafood trade balance, based on critical analysis of the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of imported fishery products. The fish and fishery product trade in Brazil, from 2005 to 2015, was studied considering import and export data mined from the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry and Commerce databases through the Aliceweb system, and clustered as follows: processing; product species; origin; conservation; and group. The main imported <b>products</b> were <b>gutted</b> fresh fish, highest price (salmon); salted dried fish, higher price (cod); frozen fish fillets, lowest price (fish and hake). The replacement of fish imports by domestic production is not enough to enable consumers to identify the equivalence between products (technical, qualitative or organoleptic).

Data were collected on export prices and trade of beche-de-mer from Kiribati, Fiji, Tonga and New Caledonia, and the selling prices, respective sizes and organoleptic properties of the products in stores in China. Export prices varied considerably within and among the four countries and low-value species were the most exported by volume. Most of the beche-de-mer from the four Pacific islands is exported to Hong Kong, where quality products are sold and others are distributed to mainland China. Prices of the beche-de-mer in Chinese stores varied up to ten-fold and were mostly influenced by species, body size and, to a lesser extent, physical damage to the products.

The processes of immune activation largely determine CD 4 +T cell depletion, leading to development of AIDS-associated and non-AIDS-related diseases. Immune activation indices are also strong predictors {{of the clinical}} outcome. Activation in HIV-infection affects both innate and adaptive immune cells, leads to increased proinflammatory cytokine production and blood coagulation. The reasons for immune activation may include different pathogens (HIV, cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, hepatitis C virus), lymphopenia and lymphopenia-induced T lymphocyte homeostatic proliferation, transfer of microbial <b>products</b> from the <b>gut,</b> due to profound CD 4 +T cell deficiency in lamina propria and altered permeability of intestinal barrier. Other factors that promote the process of immune activation are as follows: T lymphocyte "bystander" activation, increased T cell turnover, and systemic inflammation development. The review covers pathogenic mechanisms HIV-infection associated with immune activation, like as description of different laboratory parameters characterizing its manifestations in HIV-infected patients. Significance and prognostic role of these parameters in assessing efficiency of antiretroviral therapy, development of complications, and adverse outcomes of infection are presented as well...|$|R
40|$|The gut {{of lower}} {{termites}} is populated by numerous microbial species belonging to prokaryotes, fungi, yeasts and protists. These micro-organisms are organized {{in a complex}} symbiotic system, interacting together and with the insect host. Their likely ability to degrade ligno-cellulosic compounds could lead to improvements in second generation biofuels production. Lignin elimination represents a critical point as this polymer significantly interferes with industrial process of cellulose. Although host produces its own lignin-degrading enzymes, some symbionts may participate in digestion of lignin and its degradation <b>products</b> in termite <b>gut.</b> Here, we compared gut proteomes from R. santonensis after rearing on artificial diets composed of cellulose with and without lignin. The effect of lignin in artificial diets on {{different parts of the}} digestive tract was compared through liquid chromatography associated with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) experiments. Enzymatic assays were performed to characterize activities present in R. santonensis digestive tract after feeding on artificial diets. Microscopic observations of microbial communities provided some information on population balances after feeding experiment. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The fluorometric {{measurement}} of chlorophyll and its degradation <b>products</b> in the <b>guts</b> of salps {{has been used}} as a means of calculating in situ grazing rates. Salps are particularly suitable for this method because they are non-selective filter-feeders large enough to be individually collected by divers. Analysis of the pigment in the gut has shown that chlorophyll degradation products can be us-ed as tracers to estimate in situ ingestion. Filtering rates are calculated from the amount of pigment, the gut clearance time and the concentration of pigment in the water. For Pegea confoederata and Salpa maxima, gut-pigment rates are compared with rates measured in laboratory particle-clearance experiments. Salpa cylindrica has proved impossible to maintain in the laboratory and the gut-pigment results are the first feeding data for this species. Filtering rates for all species examined are high, on the order of liters per hour. Variability in the amount of pigment found in S. cylindrica sug-gests this species, unlike the others, may feed sporadically. The gut-pigment method permits measurements of filtration and ingestion by herbivores on an almost instantaneous basis and can be a useful tool for assessing grazing impact in field situations...|$|R
40|$|The human gut is a {{composite}} anaerobic environment with a large, diverse and dynamic enteric microbiota, represented by more than 100 trillion microorganisms, including at least 1000 distinct species. The discovery that a different microbial composition can influence behavior and cognition, and in turn the nervous system can indirectly influence enteric microbiota composition, has signiﬁcantly contributed to establish the well-accepted concept of gut-brain axis. This hypothesis is supported by several evidence showing mutual mechanisms, which involve the vague nerve, the immune system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis modulation and the bacteria-derived metabolites. Many {{studies have focused on}} delineating a role for this axis in health and disease, ranging from stress-related disorders such as depression, anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, and to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson Disease, Alzheimer Disease etc. Based on this background, and considering the relevance of alteration of the symbiotic state between host and microbiota, this review focuses on the role and the involvement of bioactive lipids, such as the N-acylethanolamine (NAE) family whose main members are N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoilethanolamide (OEA), and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, belonging to a large group of bioactive lipids able to modulate peripheral and central pathologic processes. It is well established their effective role in inflammation, acute and chronic pain, obesity and central nervous system diseases. It has been shown a possible correlation between these lipids and gut microbiota through different mechanisms. Indeed, systemic administration of specific bacteria can reduce abdominal pain through the involvement of cannabinoid receptor 1 in rat; on the other hand, PEA reduces inflammation markers in a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and butyrate, <b>producted</b> by <b>gut</b> microbiota, is effective in reducing inflammation and pain in irritable bowel syndrome and IBD animal models. In this review, we underline the relationship among inflammation, pain, microbiota and the different lipids, focusing on a possible involvement of NAEs and SCFAs in the gut-brain axis and their role in central nervous system diseases. ...|$|R
40|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} (HE) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, which {{develops in}} patients with acute or chronic liver failure. It is widely accepted {{to be due to}} impairment of hepatic clearance of toxic <b>products</b> from the <b>gut</b> such as ammonia. Accumulation of ammonia induces a glutamate neurotoxicity leading to an increased tone of the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA-A) receptor system in the brain which results in HE. Factors either increasing the ammonia levels (protein load, constipation, sepsis, or gastrointestinal bleeding) or potentiating the functional activity of the GABAergic system [natural benzodiazepine-like compounds (NBZDs) or exogenous benzodiazepines] may act as precipitating factors of HE. NBZDs are present in trace amounts in the blood of normal subjects and {{have been found to be}} increased in the blood of patients with liver cirrhosis, with or without HE. These compounds may derive either from the diet since they have been found in plants, vegetables and animals or from gut bacteria. The observation that intestinal bacterial flora is involved in the production of both primary agent of HE (ammonia) and precipitating factors (NBZDs) suggests that the use of nonabsorbable antibiotics such as rifaximin may be useful in preventing episodes of HE {{in patients with}} liver cirrhosis.
