5000|$|Like its {{predecessor}} the 99, the 900 contained {{a number of}} unusual design features that distinguish it from most other cars. First, the engine was installed [...] "backwards", with power delivered from the crank {{at the front of}} the car. Second, the transmission, technically a transaxle, bolted directly to the bottom of the engine to form the oil pan (albeit with separate oil lubrication). Thus, power from the crank would be delivered out of the engine at the front, then transferred down and back to the transmission below, via a set of chain-driven <b>primary</b> <b>gears.</b> In similar fashion, Minis also had their gearbox mounted directly below the engine; however, the Mini gearbox and engine shared the same oil, whereas the Saab 900 (and 99) gearboxes contained a separate sump for engine oil.|$|R
5000|$|The {{transversely}} mounted engine {{combined with}} front-wheel drive was popularized by the 1959 Mini; there the transmission was {{built into the}} sump of the engine, and drive was transferred to it via a set of <b>primary</b> <b>gears.</b> Another variant transmission concept was used by Simca in the 1960s keeping the engine and transmission in line, but transverse mounted and with unequal length driveshafts. This has proven itself to be the model on which almost all modern FWD vehicles are now based. Peugeot and Renault on their jointly developed small car engine of the 1970s where the 4-cylinder block was canted over to reduce the overall height of the engine with the transmission underneath (PSA X engine). The tendency of this layout to generate unwanted transmission [...] "whine" [...] has seen it fall out of favour. Also, clutch changes required engine removal.|$|R
5000|$|Steering was difficult, {{controlled}} by varying {{the speed of}} the two tracks. Four of the crew, two drivers (one of whom also acted as commander; he operated the brakes, the other the primary gearbox) and two [...] "gearsmen" [...] (one for the secondary gears of each track) were needed to control direction and speed, the latter never more than a walking pace. As the noise inside was deafening, the driver, after setting the <b>primary</b> <b>gear</b> box, communicated with the gearsmen with hand signals, first getting their attention by hitting the engine block with a heavy spanner. For slight turns, the driver could use the steering tail: an enormous contraption dragged behind the tank consisting of two large wheels, each of which could be blocked by pulling a steel cable causing the whole vehicle to slide in the same direction. If the engine stalled, the gearsmen would use the starting handle - a large crank between the engine and the gearbox. Many of these vehicles broke down in the heat of battle making them an easy target for German gunners. There was no wireless (radio); communication with command posts was by means of two pigeons, which had their own small exit hatch in the sponsons, or by runners. Because of the noise and vibration, early experiments had shown that radios were impractical, therefore lamps, flags, semaphore, coloured discs, and the carrier pigeons were part of the standard equipment of the various marks.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —Absence of {{a species}} {{when it is not}} {{observed}} from a given area is ensured only when the probability of observation, when present, is 1. This condition is rarely satisfied in surveys of animals in natural environments, particularly with elusive targets such as fish. Detectability (probability of species encounter) is a function of probability of individual capture, which varies widely with sampling method, fish size, physical habitat, and number of individuals present in a given area. An empirical Bayesian approach was developed for estimating probability of presence for zero-catch samples, in which the number of individuals present for a species is predicted from independent samples and used as an empirical prior. The model was illustrated for 16 species of fish sampled in 121 blocked-off stream reaches in which samples were collected using one of five <b>primary</b> <b>gear</b> methods; treatment with an ichthyocide followed. All species present were caught by the <b>primary</b> <b>gear</b> in only 17 (14 %) of the samples. Of the empirical Bayesian predictions of presence or absence from zero-catch samples, 69 % were correct. Of these zero-catch samples, 20 % of samples in which a species was present and 93 % of samples in which a species was absent were correctly predicted. The mean species richness was 10. 3, compared with 7. 4 for species richness from catch data of (mean bias of � 27. 4 %). The model predicted a mean of 9. 6 specie...|$|E

This thesis utilizes optimal control for both system design and control. As a result, a novel design optimization method to minimize fuel consumption is proposed for hydraulic hybrid vehicles. ^ The configuration chosen for this study is output-coupled power-split (OCPSD) hydraulic hybrid architecture.

Information on {{the total}} costs {{associated}} with various types of commercial fishing businesses is vital to evaluating {{the economic impact of}} fisheries regulations and management. However, obtaining reliable cost information can present a challenge. While NOAA’s Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) does collect variable (trip related) costs of fishing on a continuous basis as part of a fisheries observer program, fixed costs (which do not depend on how many trips are taken) and labor costs are only gathered periodically.   Fixed costs and labor costs can be expected to vary by fishing port, vessel size, <b>primary</b> <b>gear</b> type, crew size and other factors. The NEFSC has undertaken multiple survey efforts specifically aimed at identifying commercial vessel owners’ fixed costs, with the goal of producing profitability analyses.   The most recent data collections were for costs incurred in 2011 and 2012, with a survey for costs incurred in 2015 to be implemented in early 2016. We discuss the difficulties associated with allocating fixed costs when vessel owners use one vessel to participate in multiple fisheries or when more than one vessel is owned. We highlight the implications these challenges pose for reliable profitability analyses, using commercial fishing vessels engaged in the Northeast groundfish fishery as an example, and discuss possible methods to address the cost allocation problem...|$|E
40|$|Overexploitation of bycatch {{and target}} species in marine capture {{fisheries}} {{is the most}} widespread and direct driver of change and loss of global marine biodiversity. Bycatch in purse seine and pelagic longline tuna fisheries, the two <b>primary</b> <b>gear</b> types for catching tunas, is a primary mortality source of some populations of seabirds, sea turtles, marine mammals and sharks. Bycatch of juvenile tunas and unmarketable species and sizes of other fish in purse seine fisheries, and juvenile swordfish in longline fisheries, contributes to the overexploitation of some stocks, and is an allocation issue. There has been substantial progress in identifying gear technology solutions to seabird and sea turtle bycatch on longlines and to direct dolphin mortality in purse seines. Given sufficient investment, gear technology solutions are probably feasible for the remaining bycatch problems. More comprehensive consideration across species groups is needed to identify conflicts as well as mutual benefits from mitigation methods. Fishery-specific bycatch assessments are necessary to determine the efficacy, economic viability, practicality and safety of alternative mitigation methods. While support for gear technology research and development has generally been strong, political will to achieve broad uptake of best practices has been lacking. The five Regional Fisheries Management Organizations have achieved mixed progress mitigating bycatch. Large gaps remain in both knowledge of ecological risks and governance of bycatch. Most binding conservation and management measures fall short of gear technology best practice. A lack of performance standards, in combination with an inadequate observer coverage for all but large Pacific purse seiners, and incomplete data collection, hinders assessing measures' efficacy. Compliance is probably low due to inadequate surveillance and enforcement. Illegal, unreported and unregulated tuna fishing hampers governance efforts. Replacing consensus-based decision-making and eliminating opt-out provisions would help. Instituting rights-based management measures could elicit improved bycatch mitigation practices. While gradual improvements in an international governance of bycatch can be expected, market-based mechanisms, including retailers and their suppliers working with fisheries to gradually improve practices and governance, promise to be expeditious and effective.

40|$|Modern wild-capture marine {{fisheries}} are underpinned {{by energy}} derived from fossil fuels. This energy {{is required for}} vessel propulsion and gear operation, onboard processing, freezing and refrigeration, and producing electricity for ancillary services. Fuel use is the primary driver of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from marine fisheries, and the second highest cost to fishers globally after labour. Fuel consumption has received increased attention from industry, consumers, governments, and environmental organizations in response to higher and more unpredictable energy prices {{and the need to}} reduce GHG emissions to mitigate climate change. A large and growing amount of research has been undertaken {{since the beginning of the}} 21 st century to measure, characterize, and reduce energy use and GHG emissions in fishing fleets. This thesis provides an overview of the magnitude of fuel consumption in marine wild-capture fisheries, assesses how and why fuel consumption and GHG emissions vary between vessels, fleets, and national industries, and discusses the environmental and economic implications of energy use in fisheries at global, regional, and local scales. The global-scale research here involved the synthesis and analysis of data pertaining to fuel use in fisheries. Data from all available primary and secondary sources were compiled in a global fisheries and energy use database (FEUD). Observed rates of fuel inputs to global fisheries were characterized by target species, <b>primary</b> <b>gear</b> type, and region. Fuel use rates were then used as a proxy to estimate GHG emissions from national and global fishing fleets, assess the relative emissions from different sectors of the global fishing fleet, and track emissions from the industry from 1990 to 2011. World fisheries in 2011 consumed 40 billion litres of fuel and emitted 168 million tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent GHGs to the atmosphere. Energy performance varied between fisheries by three orders of magnitude, with crustacean fisheries consuming vastly more fuel than fisheries targeting small pelagic forage fish. Regional-scale research applied cost and revenue data to estimate the fuel use intensity (FUI) of a range of Australian fisheries and compare environmental (emissions) and economic (costs) roles of fuel use. Australian fisheries followed similar patterns to global fisheries, with all of the more fuel-intensive fisheries targeting rock lobsters and prawns, while the more efficient fisheries targeted small pelagics. The economic role of fuel also varied markedly, although fuel costs as a percentage of fishing revenue did not consistently correlate with consumption rates. Fuel expenditures in Australian fisheries ranged from 2...|$|E
