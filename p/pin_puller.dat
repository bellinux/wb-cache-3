50|$|Early {{separation}} systems using Marman clamps used {{explosive bolts}} for release. These have problems of unpredictability, {{the need to}} contain debris and difficulties in testing them. A more recent approach uses a screw thread. The tension of the clamp band itself is used to power the unscrewing of a central bolt, when released by a NASA Standard Initiator (NSI), a pyrotechnic <b>pin</b> <b>puller.</b>|$|E
40|$|Following {{the failure}} of a {{previously}} qualified pyrotechnically actuated <b>pin</b> <b>puller</b> design, an investigation led to a redesign and requalification. The emphasis of the second qualification was placed on determining the functional margin of the <b>pin</b> <b>puller</b> by comparing the energy deliverable by the pyrotechnic cartridge to the energy required to accomplish the function. Also determined were the effects of functional variables. This paper describes the failure investigation, the test methods employed and the results of the evaluation, and provides a recommended approach to assure the successful functioning of pyrotechnic devices...|$|E

Pressuretime predictions obtained with the model are presented for the simulated firing of an NSI into 1) a <b>pin</b> <b>puller</b> device, 2) a 10 cm 3 closed vessel, and 3) an apparatus known as the Dynamic Test Device. The predictions are compared with experiments. The pressure magnitudes and time scales of pressure rise and decay are predicted well by the model...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{analysis}} which determines the parametric sensitivity of a recently developed pyrotechnic model. The model {{is used to}} predict the dynamic events associated with the combustion of a pyrotechnic charge in the NASA Standard Initiator (NSI) actuated <b>pin</b> <b>puller.</b> The model is formulated {{as a set of}} ordinary differential equations and solved to determine system performance. Using an experimentally verified pressure-time prediction as a baseline, the sensitivity of the kinetic energy imparted to the pin as a function of system parameters is studied. The results illustrate the usefulness of the model for predicting the performance of pyrotechnic devices and also suggest that beyond certain limits a precise knowledge of model parameters is not necessary in order to evaluate the <b>pin</b> <b>puller</b> performance...|$|E

40|$|Hot <b>pin</b> <b>pull</b> test is {{frequently}} {{used for the}} pad crater evaluation. Although it carries several merits, it still has certain drawbacks such as time consuming and causing potential thermal impact on the PCB during the pin attachment process. In this paper, an innovative cold <b>pin</b> <b>pull</b> test method with pre-fabricated pin arrays is introduced. A set of fixture is designed and manufactured in advance. An array of pins can {{be attached to the}} test board at one time. With this fixture, instead of attaching the pin one by one, the test panel with pin arrays can be prepared after only two times of reflow without severe thermal impact. Compared with the conventional cold ball pull tests, this newly developed method cannot only equally exhibit the pad crater characteristics of the PCB, but also reduces the scattering in testing results. These conclusions are well proven by the experimental data generated in the present study. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|An {{actuated}} {{latch pin}} developed {{to meet the}} need for a reusable locking device is described. The unit can function as a <b>pin</b> <b>puller</b> or as a pin pusher latch. Initial prototype testing demonstrated the feasibility of the device with the unit being driven from a 28 V dc supply and using 15 W to drive a 12 mm diameter pin through a stroke of 10 mm with a side load of 100 N in 120 ms. High wear rates with a MOS 2 lubrication on the ballscrew and angular contact bearings have necessitated the reduction in the duty cycle from 1000 cycles in air and vacuum to 100 in air and 1000 in vacuum...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analysis for pyrotechnic combustion and pin {{motion in the}} NASA Standard Initiator (NSI) actuated <b>pin</b> <b>puller.</b> The conservation principles and constitutive relations for a multi-phase system are posed and reduced {{to a set of}} eight ordinary differential equations which are solved to predict the system performance. The model tracks the interactions of the unreacted, incompressible solid pyrotechnic, incompressible condensed phase combustion products, and gas phase combustion products. The model accounts for multiple pyrotechnic grains, variable burn surface area, and combustion product mass flow rates through an orifice located within the device. Pressure-time predictions compare favorably with experimental data. Results showing model sensitivity to changes in the cross-sectional area of the orifice are presented...|$|E

50|$|The {{weapon was}} unusual among {{contemporary}} machine guns by {{its use of}} a lever-delayed blowback operation. When firing, the pressure pushing the case head rearward initiated an impulse on a cam that sent the bolt carrier rearward. After a certain distance, a link (in this case the firing <b>pin)</b> <b>pulled</b> the bolt head, hence extracting the spent case. Since there was no primary extraction, the chamber was fluted to allow powder gases to flow back, unsticking the case from the wall chamber like on Heckler & Koch type roller-delayed blowback weapons.|$|R

The plug is released from the window mount assemblies using pneumatic pin pullers and separation springs in the release mechanism.

40|$|Reliability of a <b>pin</b> <b>puller</b> was {{predicted}} by Monte Carlo simulation. The prediction method {{is based on}} the stress-strength interference model that failure occurs if the stress exceeds the strength. In this study, the strength is considered as the energy delivered by combustion of pyrotechnics to retreat the pin to a predetermined position, whereas the stress is regarded as the energy required to resist the pin movement. The former mainly depends on the amount of pyrotechnic charge and the latter is governed by several friction forces and the energy dissipation within locking mechanism. Both the variables of stress and strength were computed using an analytical performance model. The method presented here, not depending upon a large number of test item, can be applicable to predict the reliability of other kinds of pyrotechnic devices...|$|E

25|$|Explosive booby traps {{were also}} employed, some command detonated by hidden observers. They ranged from single bullets, to grenades, to dud bombs and shells. Anti-vehicle traps ranged from mines to buried {{artillery}} rounds. Helicopter traps were often deployed in trees surrounding a potential landing zone, triggered by an observer, or the rotor's wash. Booby traps were also made from American and ARVN trash in the field. Discarded ration cans, for example, were loaded with grenades that had <b>pins</b> <b>pulled</b> partially – {{the other end}} connected to tripwire. The sides of the can held the pin in place until the tripwire was activated. Discarded batteries and communications wire was also used – the batteries hooked to the waste wire, providing an ignition current to spark the charge of dud or discarded mortar/artillery rounds.|$|R
40|$|The {{composition}} of Zr-based thin films on vulcanized synthetic rubber {{by means of}} self-ion-assisted deposition was investigated by utilizing the Rutherford backscattering technique and RUMP code simulation. <b>Pin</b> <b>Pull</b> Test method was applied both to measure the level of adhesion between the deposited metal (Me) -based layer and rubber and mechanical properties of modified rubber surface. Hardness measurements of the thin films on substrate were fulfilled by applying a conventional Knoop method, an ultra-low load indenter and a laser-acoustic test method. The deposited films may be soft or very hard in dependence of Me species. Deposition of Me-based coatings changes the wettability of the modified rubber to water. We observe 10 % decrease and 30 % increase in a contact angle of water when Mo-based and Zr-based coatings are deposited on the rubber...|$|R
