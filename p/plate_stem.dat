40|$|A {{complete}} {{account of}} the whole developmental process of neurogenesis involves understanding a number of complex underlying molecular processes. Among them, those that govern the crucial transition from proliferative (self-replicating) to neurogenic neural progenitor (NP) cells remain largely unknown. Due to its sequential rostro-caudal gradients of proliferation and neurogenesis, the prospective spinal cord of the chick embryo is a good experimental system to study this issue. We report that the NOTCH ligand DELTA- 1 is expressed in scattered cycling NP cells in the prospective chick spinal cord preceding the onset of neurogenesis. These Delta- 1 -expressing progenitors are placed in between the proliferating caudal neural <b>plate</b> (<b>stem</b> zone) and the rostral neurogenic zone (NZ) where neurons are born. Thus, these Delta- 1 -expressing progenitors define a proliferation to neurogenesis transition zone (PNTZ). Gain and loss of function experiments carried by electroporation demonstrate that the expression of Delta- 1 in individual progenitors of the PNTZ is necessary and sufficient to induce neuronal generation. The activation of NOTCH signalling by DELTA- 1 in the adjacent progenitors inhibits neurogenesis and is required to maintain proliferation. However, rather than inducing cell cycle exit and neuronal differentiation by a typical lateral inhibition mechanism as in the NZ, DELTA- 1 /NOTCH signalling functions in a distinct manner in the PNTZ. Thus, the inhibition of NOTCH signalling arrests proliferation {{but it is not}} sufficient to elicit neuronal differentiation. Moreover, after the expression of Delta- 1 PNTZ NP continue cycling and induce the expression of Tis 21, a gene that is upregulated in neurogenic progenitors, before generating neurons. Together, these experiments unravel a novel function of DELTA–NOTCH signalling that regulate...|$|E

We hypothesized that BVES influences intestinal stem cell programs and is critical to SI homeostasis after radiation injury. At baseline, Bves–/– mice demonstrated increased crypt height, as well as elevated proliferation and expression of the stem cell marker Lgr 5 compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Intercross with Lgr 5 -EGFP reporter mice confirmed expansion of the stem cell compartment in Bves–/– mice. To examine stem cell function after BVES deletion, we used ex vivo 3 D-enteroid cultures.

40|$|Introduction: Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) can be {{isolated}} from adipose tissue and are currently used in vitro for experimental studies. MSCs are often mislabeled as Adipose-derived Stem Cells (ADSCs) despite presenting a more differentiated phenotype. The isolation {{and expansion of}} non-adherent progenitors from adipose-derived stem cells (napADSCs), has been achieved in our laboratory and is currently under investigation. In this study we investigate: a) the proof of stemness of such progenitors, and b) the feasibility of napADSCs adhesion over Integra® for cell colonization and for future differentiation and engineering of semi-synthetic tissues. Material and Methods: Adipose tissue (20 cc) was extracted from lipoaspirate samples of 15 healthy donors following patients written consent. Following mechanical and enzymatic digestion, samples were <b>plated</b> in <b>stem</b> cell-specific enriched media and in no adherence conditions. Clonal expansion of a single cell was assessed by limiting dilution and asymmetric division was detected by PKH 26 staining. Expanded cells were seeded within Integra® in 24 -well plates. Results: NapADSCs represent an upstream line of mesenchymal progenitors compared to more differentiated, adherent, fibroblast-like MSCs. NapADSCs colonies defined as spheroids (polyclonal) and sphere-derived clonogenic cells (monoclonal) were visible in 1 - 3 weeks and their stemness confirmed in vitro by clonal expansion. NapADSCs adhesion to Integra® was achieved modifying culturing conditions, and was visible in 3 - 7 days with phenotype change from napADSCs to fibroblast-like MSCs. Conclusions: Our data suggests that the identification of napADSCs may dissipate the doubts on the stem-cell origin of the more differentiated and commonly used adherent MSCs. The ability of napADSCs to adhere to a clinically available dermal regenerative template, and grow within its three-dimensional structure, may prove useful in regenerative surgery. Further studies are warranted to assess whether such procedure may represent a first preliminary step toward clinical application of semi-synthetic tissues...|$|R
5000|$|Induction of {{the floor}} plate during {{embryogenesis}} of vertebrate embryos has been studied extensively in chick and zebrafish and {{occurs as a result}} of a complex signaling network among tissues, the details of which have yet to be fully refined. Currently there are several competing lines of thought. First, floor plate differentiation may be mediated by inductive signaling from the underlying notochord, an axial mesoderm derived signaling structure. This is supported experimentally in chick, in which floor plate induction, as well as associative ventral nervous tissue differentiation, is mediated by the secreted signaling molecule Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Shh is expressed in a gradient with highest concentration localized in the notochord and floor plate. In vitro tissue grafting experiments show that removal of this molecule prevents differentiation {{of the floor}} plate, whereas its ectopic expression induces differentiation of floor plate cells. [...] An alternative view proposes that neural tube floor <b>plate</b> cells <b>stem</b> from precursor cells which migrate directly from axial mesoderm. Through chick - quail hybrid experiments as well as genetic interaction experiments in zebrafish, it appears that notochord and floor plate cells originate from a common precursor. Furthermore, in zebrafish, Nodal signaling is required for differentiation of medial floor plate cells whereas Shh is expendable. These data may indicate that the floor plate induction mechanism in amniotes and anamniotes differs. [...] To reconcile these differences, a dual-mode induction model has been proposed in chick. In this model, exclusively ectodermal cells are induced to become medial floor plate during gastrulation by prechordal mesoderm, possibly through Nodal signaling. Later in development during neurulation, extended contact and interaction between notochord and fated floor plate cells causes differentiation, suggesting a cooperative effect between Nodal and Shh signaling.|$|R

The MKN- 45 cells were able to form spheroid bodies when cultured in stem cell-condi-tioned medium. The spheroid body-forming cells showed a significantly higher (P< 0. 01) expression of OCT 4 and ABCG 2 compared with the parental cells. These data suggest that the spheroid body cells from the MKN- 45 GC cell line cultured in stem cell-conditioned medium possessed gastric CSC proper-ties. The co-expression of OCT 4 and ABCG 2 by these cells may represent the presence of a subpopulation of gastric CSCs...|$|R

40|$|All {{garlic cloves}} {{infected}} at harvest {{with the white}} rot fungus (Scierotium cepivorum) decayed while in storage. The white rot fungus was not recovered from any decayed trashy material in this seedlot other than scierotia. Nevertheless some sclerotia of the white rot fungus survived traditional hot water-formaldehyde seed treatment processes. Those sur-viving were aggregated within decayed cloves, which might pass through the mechanical processors associated withcracking and seed treatment. Reduction in time and/or tem-perature of the treatment solutions allowed partial survival even of unaggregated scierotia. It remains unclear if scle-rotia surviving hot water treatments are fully competent. Hypothetical Question: May the garlic industry feel secure that the standard Lear-Johnson seed treatment, and possibly milder variations of it, will eradicate the white rot fungus from a seed lot. METHODS In the summer of 1987, a bag of garlic infected with the white rot fungus (Sclerotium cepivorum) was collected in Monterey County CA, and shipped to the University of Cali-fornia Tulelake Field Station in Tulelake, CA. It was held as per normal seed storage until January, 1988. In January, 1988, the stored garlic was separated into several compo-nents: 1) loose sclerotia and 2) fully-decayed cloves in which abundant scierotia were aggregated together with clove tissue and mycelium ("aggregates"), these varied from 0. 5 mm to 1. 5 mm in various irregular cross sections and were cal-culated to contain from 4, 000 - 25, 000 sclerotia each and 3) cloves which appeared normally developed and uninfected (no signs of the fungus on either <b>stem</b> <b>plates</b> or covering leaf sheaths) ...|$|R
40|$|Palms lack {{secondary}} growth so their primary vascular system is long-lived {{and must be}} minimally vulnerable to dysfunction. For water movement, the axial xylem must be well defended against cavitation. Climbing palms can be very long and represent a maximum solution to transport problems. How is this demonstrated in their anatomy? This article contrasts stem vascular anatomy in a canelike 2 ̆ 2 tree palm 2 ̆ 2 (Rhapis excelsa) with that in the American climbing palm Desmoncus and the Old World rattan genus Calamus. Rhapis, representing the basic classical palm vasculature, has a continuously integrated vascular system determined by branching of the axial (stem) system to produce leaf traces, bridges, and continuing axial bundles. Axial transport is favored over appendicular structures because leaves are irrigated solely by narrower protoxylem tracheids. Maximum stem vessel length is inherently limited by the leaf contact distance (LCD). Desmoncus is very similar except that interconnections involve more numerous bridges and axial continuity is less obvious. Both Rhapis and Desmoncus retain scalariform perforation <b>plates</b> in their <b>stem</b> vessels. However, Calamus lacks axial continuity because axial bundles extend distally into leaves as leaf traces but end blindly in a basipetal direction. The only interconnection is via narrow transverse commissures (not bridges). Calamus stem metaxylem vessels have simple perforation plates. Resistance to water transport can be calculated, based on axial changes in metaxylem vessel diameter and is very high in the climbing palms. The unique features of Calamus may relate to safety of the hydraulic system as much as its efficiency, with Desmoncus an intermediate condition more clearly based on the classical model of palm vasculature. Calamus may have also evolved to mitigate the limitation of vessel length determined by LCD. Further anatomical solutions to the climbing habit in palms are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Lodging, the {{permanent}} displacement of plant {{stems from the}} vertical, occurs on average once every four years in UK wheat crops, when it reduces the yield and bread making quality of grain. Lodging usually occurs {{in the summer and}} control is most commonly sought by applying growth retarding chemicals in the spring. This thesis develops a method of predicting which crops are prone to lodging so that spring lodging controls can be targeted most effectively. A model was developed in association with this study which calculates stem and root lodging risk from summer-time plant, weather and soil factors. The spread of the plant's root <b>plate,</b> the <b>stem</b> diameter and the number of shoots per plant were shown to have very strong influences on lodging. Structural rooting depth, stem failure yield stress, height at centre of gravity and the rate at which stems oscillate in wind (natural frequency) were also important, but less influential. Methods of predicting the most important lodging-associated plant characters from crop observations in spring were developed from the literature. These were then tested through experiments in 1995 and 1996 with factorial combinations of crops sown in late September and late October, at 500 seeds m- 2 and 250 seeds m- 2 and with large and small levels of residual soil nitrogen. Early sowing, dense seed rates and fertile soils all increased stem and root lodging, with sowing date having the greatest influence. Plants sown at high densities had small root plates and were poorly anchored; they also had fewer shoots causing a smaller leverage. Early sown plants had shoots with a high centre of gravity and slow natural frequency, causing a greater leverage. Plants sown early on fertile soils had narrow, weak stems. Final shoot number per plant was predicted with good precision (R 2 = 094) from spring plant number m- 2 and maximum shoot number m- 2 using a model of tiller survival. Stem diameter was predicted with moderate precision (R 2 = 057) from spring canopy size and shoot number m- 2, via a calculation of the amount of dry matter partitioned to each <b>stem</b> base. Root <b>plate</b> spread showed a linear and inverse relationship to spring plant density (R 2 = 0. 48), mainly as a result of variation in the length of the rigid roots and in the width of the plant base. It is concluded that early season crop observations have the potential to predict the values of the most influential lodging-associated plant characters, from which a model of lodging can calculate the proneness of crops to stem or root lodging in time for remedial action. The next steps would be to develop prediction schemes for other plant characters which influence lodging and test all the predictions in a wider range of crops, sites and seasons...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only availableThe {{transplantation}} of neuralized {{stem cells}} holds {{the promise of}} providing neurotrophic effects to individuals suffering from some neurodegenerative disorders. Several current neuralization protocols require the formation of embryoid bodies to obtain a population of neural stem cells. Embryoid bodies (EBs) are round, free-floating aggregates of a heterogeneous population of ES cells undergoing differentiation. The addition of neuralization factors, such as retinoic acid (RA), induces the EB cells toward a neural fate. However, the EBs are only useful if the cells they consist of can survive dissociation. One way of forming EBs is to trypsinize cultured ES cells and transfer them to an uncoated <b>plate</b> with Embryonic <b>Stem</b> cell Induction Media. Different protocols have suggested the use of various trypsin concentrations, ranging from 0. 05 % to 0. 25 %, for varying lengths of time. Our current lab protocol uses 0. 25 % trypsin for 5 minutes, but on occasion this leads to extensive loss of cells during EB dissociation. It was hypothesized that using the high trypsin concentration {{for an extended period}} of time was causing the eventual death of the neuralized cells. The goal of my experiments was to optimize the trypsinization protocol that precedes embryoid body formation and to obtain the highest yield of large EBs with the maximum amount of cell survivorship following EB dissociation. Trypsinization conditions that were analyzed included 0. 05 % trypsin for 5 minutes, 0. 25 % trypsin for 5 minutes, and 0. 25 % trypsin for 2. 5 minutes. Our results suggest that both 0. 25 % trypsin for 2. 5 minutes and 0. 05 % trypsin for 5 minutes result in a higher cell survivorship after EB dissociation than the current trypsinization protocol. Cell survivorship was determined by comparing cell counts prior to trypsinization to cell counts following EB dissociation. Future studies could include testing low oxygen tensions and different temperatures during trypsinization. Life Sciences Undergraduate Research Opportunity Progra...|$|R
