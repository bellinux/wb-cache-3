25|$|Anti-Federalism {{is another}} key aspect of paleoconservatism, which adherents see as an antitype to the {{managerial}} state. The paleocon flavor urges honoring the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidiarity,</b> that is, decentralized government, local rule, private property and minimal bureaucracy. In an international context, this view would be known as federalism and paleocons often look to John C. Calhoun for inspiration.|$|E
25|$|The Treaty of Lisbon allows {{national}} parliaments eight weeks to study legislative proposals {{made by the}} European Commission and decide whether to send a reasoned opinion stating why the national parliament considers it to be incompatible with the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidiarity.</b> National parliaments may vote to have the measure reviewed. If one third (or one quarter, where the proposed EU measure concerns freedom, justice and security) of {{national parliaments}} are in favour of a review, the Commission would have to review the measure and if it decides to maintain it, must give a reasoned opinion to the Union legislator as to why it considers the measure to be compatible with subsidiarity.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{recognizing}} how {{crony capitalism}} weakened the economy due to collusion {{between government and}} big business and adhering to the Catholic social <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidiarity,</b> President Aquino {{set out on a}} course of market liberalization agenda {{while at the same time}} emphasizing solidarity, people empowerment and civic engagement to help alleviate poverty in the country. The Aquino administration also sought to bring back fiscal discipline in order as it aimed to trim down the government's budget deficit that ballooned during Marcos' term through privatization of bad government assets and deregulation of many vital industries. As president, Aquino sought out to dismantle the cartels, monopolies and oligopolies of important industries that were set up by Marcos cronies during the dark days of Martial Law, particularly in the sugar and coconut industries. By discarding these monopolies and allowing market-led prices and competition, small farmers and producers were given a fair chance to sell their produce and products at a more reasonable, competitive and profitable price. This, in a way, also helped a lot in improving the lot of farmers who are in dire need of increasing their personal income and earnings. It was also during Aquino's time that vital economic laws such as the Built-Operate-Transfer Law, Foreign Investments Act and the Consumer Protection and Welfare Act were enacted.|$|E
