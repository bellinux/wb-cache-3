50|$|Job {{enlargement}} means {{increasing the}} scope of a job through extending the range of its job duties and responsibilities generally within the same level and periphery. Job enlargement involves combining various activities {{at the same level}} in the organization and adding them to the existing job. It is also called the horizontal expansion of job activities. This contradicts the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>specialisation</b> and the division of labour whereby work is divided into small units, each of which is performed repetitively by an individual worker and the responsibilities are always clear. Some motivational theories suggest that the boredom and alienation caused by the division of labour can actually cause efficiency to fall. Thus, job enlargement seeks to motivate workers through reversing the process <b>of</b> <b>specialisation.</b> A typical approach might be to replace assembly lines with modular work; instead of an employee repeating the same step on each product, they perform several tasks on a single item. In order for employees to be provided with Job Enlargement they will need to be retrained in new fields to understand how each field works.|$|R

40|$|The Smart Specialisation (S 3) Platform was {{established}} by the European Commission in 2011 to help European regions to define their R&I strategies based on the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> smart <b>specialisation.</b> This <b>principle</b> suggests that each region can identify its strongest assets and R&I potential {{so that it can}} then focus its efforts and resources on a limited number of priorities where it can really develop excellence. Being able to position one’s region among other regions is seen as a pre-condition to being able to choose reasonable areas for competitive and sustainable growth. One important collaborative tool developed by the S 3 Platform to assist its member regions and Member States in this task is peer review. The S 3 Platform views peer review as an important mutual learning and knowledge dissemination channel. The S 3 peer review methodology was first developed and employed in 2012, yet it is being continuously improved and adapted to ensure the S 3 Platform offers regions and Member States a framework that is structured enough to ensure regions under review receive adequate feedback, yet sufficiently flexible to facilitate open and productive discussions. While the European Commission uses peer reviews as a tool at a Member State level in a number of policy areas for some time now, it still appears to be an under-documented phenomenon in the regional policymaking context. This paper addresses this gap by documenting the newly developed S 3 peer review methodology. JRC. J. 2 -Knowledge for Growt...|$|R
40|$|Planning {{activity}} {{gives an}} idea of what, when and perhaps even how to do certain activities which are necessary in achieving the organisation’s tasks. However, it does not deal {{with the question of}} who will provide the planned activities and using which sources. The answer is in management activities – organizing which directly stems from the plan-ning activities. Internal stimuli for an organisational change are based on empirically verified hypothesis, the ‘con-gruence theory’. Congruence (consensus) expresses the basic con-dition of efficient functioning of an organization structure, i. e. achieving a close agreement between the situation factors and project parameters (congru-ence hypothesis). Project parameters of organization structure The project parameters are understood, in agree-ment with the congruence theory, as all regulated quantities through which the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> coordina-tion, <b>specialisation</b> and work allocation are applied. An important property of project parameters is their ability to influence or set their level of utilisation by managers. Situation factors of an organisation Unlike the project parameters, situation parameters cannot be regulated directly by any instruction (they emerge, more or less, spontaneously during the “life ” of the organisation). The relationship of situation factors with the relevant parameters is shown in Figure 1. The objective of the present paper is to show the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> the congruent model production with a consistent check of the unambiguous partial project parameters. The output of the model then is a pro-posal of organisation changes stemming from the new setting of the level of project parameters. METHODS AND PRESENTATION RESULTS In most situations of enterprise behaviour there is a discrepancy between the situation where the organisation finds itself and its structural arrange-ment. This discrepancy is an effect of the theory of congruence which requires efficient structuring to b...|$|R
40|$|The English regions have {{witnessed}} a dramatic shift in institutional structures {{for economic development}} since the new UK Coalition Government took office in 2010, involving the formation of 39 Local Enterprise Partnerships that have replaced the former Regional Development Agencies. These changes in the English context have occurred simultaneously with a radical review of regional policy at the European level which has focused attention on the significance of ‘place-based’ policies that are sensitive to, or even constructed upon, the nature of geographic differences. While there are parallels between the principles that underpin localism and place-based policy, in practice recent experience in the UK {{has been marked by}} increased centralisation of policy making. A review of the current priorities of the Local Enterprise Partnerships as set out in available strategies and policy documents tends to emphasise supply-side support for businesses alongside a role in place promotion. Sector groups are identified by many Local Enterprise Partnerships but very few are currently in a position to develop sector-based interventions or cluster policies that might ultimately contribute to the delivery of UK national industrial policy. Increased centralisation of industrial policy in the UK contrasts with policy directions at the European scale that have involved place-based approaches and the application <b>of</b> the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> smart <b>specialisation.</b> It is concluded {{that there is a need}} for greater place-sensitivity in UK industrial policy and consideration of the role that Local Enterprise Partnerships might play in the design as well as delivery of national and sub-national economic strategies...|$|R

40|$|Introduction] The {{notion of}} 'smart specialisation' {{is set to}} become an {{important}} policy rationale in the upcoming structural funding period 2014 - 2020. Although the original academic concept of this policy approach was sectorally oriented and rooted {{in the analysis of}} the EU-US productivity gap (e. g. Foray et al. 2009), the concept is increasingly applied to regional contexts. Essential for the application <b>of</b> the smart <b>specialisation</b> concept in a regional context is the fact that regions are often faced with scarce resources and limited budgets which they should allocate according to external influences (e. g. global competition) and inherited structures (sectoral foci, linkages between sectors, innovation infrastructure). Therefore, and in accordance with the smart specialisation strategy (S 3), regional governments need to design policies {{in such a way as}} to support the most promising areas of present and future comparative advantage in order to foster regional prosperity. Although the ideas behind smart specialisation are not entirely new on the regional level, the smart specialisation concept is going to expand its influence to regional innovation policy making. Thus, this contribution illuminates the interface between the smart specialisation concept and regional systems of innovation approach, since innovation is going to be a key issue in the next structural funding period. Key arguments for the usefulness <b>of</b> the smart <b>specialisation</b> concept in the field of the design of regional innovation policy making will be collected and three examples are presented in form of case studies. This contribution aims to demonstrate that the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> smart <b>specialisation</b> have been implicitly applied in certain European regions for years in form of future-oriented transformation processes. Likewise this contribution aims to illustrate how the experiences from these regions can contribute to policy learning. In doing so, the structure is the following: firstly, existing literature on the smart specialisation concept is revised and secondly, these findings are reconsidered with regard to the regional systems of innovation approach. In particular, if and how the smart specialisation concept will influence regional development processes and potentially regional innovation systems. Three key working theses adopt these ideas and guide the empirical analyses. Methodologically, the paper pursues a case study approach. The policy trajectories of three different case study regions are analysed within the innovation systems approach and conclusions are drawn concerning the smart specialisation concept. Finally, the paper closes with a conclusion, concerning the influencing potential <b>of</b> the smart <b>specialisation</b> concept on regional innovation systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{applies the}} <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the neo-Ricardian (or Sraffian) theory of {{international}} trade to certain joint production systems. It is shown that, in contrast with single-product systems, (i) there {{is not always a}} pattern <b>of</b> international <b>specialisation,</b> which would entail the increase of the real wage rate in both economies, and (ii) the 'law of comparative advantage' has no general validity. Furthermore, not only the existence of such a pattern <b>of</b> <b>specialisation</b> but also the validity of this law depend on the values of the variables of distribution of income. The analysis is wholly based on two of the numerical examples formulated by Bidard in 1997, and further generalised in an elementary way only when this is considered necessary.
