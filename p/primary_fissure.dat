T 1 weighted MR images and T 2 weighted MR images taken within 8 hours after delivery {{were compared with}} H. E. stained histological slices. On T 1 weighted MR images after 18 weeks gestation, the neopallium consisted of four layers which appeared as areas of high, relatively high, low and high signal intensity, respectively, from the ventricular side to the brain surface. These layers corresponded to the ventricular zone, the subventricular zone, the intermediate zone and the cortical plate respectively. On T 2 weighted images, these areas appeared only as three layers of low, relatively low and high signal intensity, respectively, from the ventricular side, and the most lateral layer was not distinct from the adjacent layer. Beyond 14 weeks gestation, the ganglionic eminence showed almost the same signal intensity as the ventricular zone. The visualization of the <b>primary</b> <b>fissures</b> by MR images was compared with reported anatomical studies in all fetuses, and with anatomical sections from 18 fetuses. These studies revealed little variation in {{the time of the first}} appearance of <b>primary</b> <b>fissures,</b> except that there was a few weeks delay on MR imaging (MRI) of mesially located fissures.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Metallurgical coke for blast furnace and foundry use, and for some domestic boiler cokes are produced by carbonising coals in slot-type ovens. The coal is heated by heat transferred from the hot oven walls (usually 1250 °C) so that a temperature gradient is set up within the oven charge. A layer of plastic coal is formed (350 - 500 °C) which moves progressively towards the oven centre as carbonisation proceeds. Immediately after re-solidification, and again near 700 °C, the semi-coke suffers shrinkage as the carbon structure reorganises The post re-solidification shrinkage is the more severe and results in large, horizontal and vertical <b>primary</b> <b>fissures</b> being formed which allow breakage of the charge into lumps as it is pushed from the oven. A large central fissure, formed when the two plastic layers meet, divides the charge into two. Further breakage occurs at <b>primary</b> <b>fissures</b> on handling the coke after pushing. Smaller secondary fissures present in the resultant coke lump {{are believed to be}} a result of the shrinkage near 700 °C. Coke has three roles in the blast furnace: as a source of heat, a source of reducing agents and as a support for the burden. The latter function is particularly important {{at the bottom of the}} stack when coke is the only solid material present. The blast furnace output is dependent on the quantity of air that can be pushed up the stack. This depends on the permeability of the coke bed in the lower reaches of the stack. To maintain permeability, the coke should not suffer size degradation as it progresses down the stack; a mixture of large and small coke particles is disastrous. Thus coke quality tends to be assessed in terms of resistance to size degradation in a drum test. Size degradation occurs as a result of volumetric breakage at fissures and abrasion of surfaces. Brittle fracture theory suggests that volumetric breakage should occur as a result of the propagation of secondary fissures in coke lumps [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Background. This paper {{presents}} {{our first}} {{experience in the}} treatment of <b>primary</b> anal <b>fissure</b> by injection of botulinum A toxin into the internal sphincter. Methods. The study group of the retrospective study included 12 outpatients (8 females and 4 males), mean age 42 (range 18 - 60). During the period 2000 - 2003, after unsuccessful conservative treatment, patients were treated with the injections of botulinum A toxin, 100 units {{on both sides of the}} anal fissure laterally into the internal anal sphincter (50 units on either side). The patients were clinically evaluated 3, 7, and 30 days, and 3 and 6 months after the treatment. Results. Three fissures had healed after a month, and seven after 3 months. Two remained unhealed, but asymptomatic. There was no incontinence of flatus or faeces after 3 months of the treatment. After temporary healing, two fissures relapsed after 6 months, and these patients had the adequate tonus of the anal sphincter muscles. Except for the temporary incontinence, there were neither other side-efects, nor serious complications. Conclusion. Injection of botulinum A toxin achieved good results {{in the treatment of}} anal fissure. The appropriate use makes this method safe as an alternative to surgical treatment of anal fissure...|$|R

Materials and Methods: The study was done on 80 extracted permanent premolars that seem to be intact or with <b>primary</b> caries in <b>fissures.</b> Three trained dentist examined the teeth in four stages: VI, BW radiography, LF, and histologic examination. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of all methods were calculated and compared. For the LF method, using ROC curve and counterpart points on it, we determined upper and lower limits and calculated the parameters. Results: The estimated accuracy was 58. 9 &#x 0025; for VI and 45. 1 &#x 0025; for BW radiography methods. Kappa coefficient for interexaminer reproducibility was 57 &#x 0025; and 34. 1 &#x 0025; in VI and BW radiography, respectively. Inter- and intraexaminer reproducibility coefficients of LF methods were 78. 4 &#x 0025; and 83. 6 &#x 0025;, respectively. The mean intraexaminer reproducibility coefficient in the VI method was 61. 2 &#x 0025;.

6000|$|Assume {{that the}} {{diameter}} of the missing planet was 20,000 miles; that its solid crust was a thousand miles thick; that under this came a shell of molten metallic matter which was another thousand miles thick; and that the space, 16,000 miles in diameter, within this, was occupied by the equally dense mass of gases above the [...] "critical point", which, entering into a proto-chemical combination, caused the destroying explosion. The <b>primary</b> <b>fissures</b> in the crust must have been far apart--probably averaging distances between them as great as the thickness of the crust. Supposing them approximately equidistant, there would, in the equatorial periphery, be between 60 and 70 fissures. By the time the primary fragments thus separated had been heaved a mile outwards, the fissures formed would severally have, at the surface, a width of 170 odd yards. Of course these great masses, as soon as they moved, would themselves begin to fall in pieces; especially at their bounding surfaces. But passing over the resulting complications, we see that when the masses had been propelled 10 miles outwards, the fissures between them would be each a mile wide. Notwithstanding the enormous forces at work, an appreciable interval would elapse before these vast portions of the crust could be put in motion with any considerable velocities. Perhaps the estimate will be under the mark if we assume that it took 10 seconds to propel them through the first mile, and that, by implication, at the end of 20 seconds they had travelled 4 miles, {{and at the end of}} 30 seconds 9 miles. Supposing this granted, let us ask what would be taking place in each intervening fissure a thousand miles deep, which, in the space of half a minute, had opened out to nearly a mile wide, and in the subsequent half minute to a chasm approaching 3 miles in width. There would first be propelled through it enormous jets of the molten metals composing the internal liquid shell; and these would part into relatively small masses as they were shot into space. Presently, as the chasm opened to some miles in width, the molten metals would begin to be followed by the equally dense gaseous matter behind, and the two would rush out together. Soon the gases, predominating, would carry with them the portions of the liquid shell continually collapsing; until the blast became one filled with millions of small masses, billions of smaller masses, and trillions of drops. These would be driven into space in a stream, the emission of which would continue for many seconds or even several minutes. Remembering the rate of motion of the jets emitted from the solar surface, and supposing that the blasts produced by this explosion reached only one-tenth of that rate, these myriads of small masses and drops would be propelled with planetary velocities, and in approximately the same direction. I say approximately, because they would be made to deviate somewhat by the friction and irregularities of the chasm passed through, and also by the rotation of the planet. Observe, however, that though they would all have immense velocities, their velocities would not be equal. During its earlier stages the blast would be considerably retarded by the resistance which the sides of its channel offered. When this became relatively small the velocity of the blast would reach its maximum; from which it would decline when the space for emission became very wide, and the pressure behind consequently less. Hence these almost infinitely numerous particles of planet-spray, as we might call it, as well as those formed by the condensation of the metallic vapours accompanying them, would forthwith begin to part company: some going rapidly in advance, and others falling behind; until the stream of them, perpetually elongating, formed an orbit round the Sun, or rather an assemblage of innumerable orbits, separating widely at aphelion and perihelion, but approximating midway, where they might fall within a space of, say, some two millions of miles, as do the orbits of the November meteors. At a later stage of the explosion, when the large masses, having moved far outwards, had also fallen to pieces of every size, from that of Vesta to that of an aerolite, and when the channels just described had ceased to exist, the contents of the planet would disperse themselves with lower velocities and without any unity of direction. Hence we see causes alike for the streams of shooting stars, for the solitary shooting stars visible to the naked eye, and for the telescopic shooting stars a score times more numerous.|$|R

40|$|Recent design-based stereologic {{studies have}} shown that the early {{postnatal}} (< 1 year of age) human cerebellum is characterized by very high plasticity and may thus be very sensitive to external and internal influences during the first year of life. A potential weakness of these studies is that they were not separately performed on functionally relevant subregions of the cerebellum, as was the case in a few design-based stereologic studies on the adult human cerebellum. The aim of the present study was to assess whether it is possible to identify unequivocally the primary, superior posterior, horizontal, ansoparamedian, and posterolateral fissures in the early postnatal human cerebellum, based on which functionally relevant subregions could be delineated. This was tested in 20 human post mortem cerebellar halves from subjects aged between 1 day and 11 months by means of a combined macroscopic and microscopic approach. We found that the superior posterior, horizontal, and posterolateral fissures can be reliably identified on all of the specimens. However, reliable and reproducible identification of the <b>primary</b> and ansoparamedian <b>fissures</b> was not possible. Accordingly, it appears feasible to perform subregion-specific investigations in the early postnatal human cerebellum when the identification of subregions is restricted to crus I (bordered by the superior posterior and horizontal fissures) and the flocculus (bordered by the posterolateral fissure). As such, it is recommended to define the entire cerebellar cortex as the region of interest in design-based stereologic studies on the early postnatal human cerebellum to guarantee reproducibility of results...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{view of the}} {{relatively}} recent introduction of the chinchilla as an experimental model in human neurological research, there rises {{a need for a}} precise knowledge of the anatomy and structure of the different segments composing this species’ encephalon. Our study aimed to enrich the current data pool, by providing a macroscopical and histogical description of the chinchilla's cerebellum. 10 samples were harvested from commercially slaughtered young adults of both sexes. 5 samples were macroscopically examined and 5 samples were serially cut and stained (both Hematoxylin-Eosin and a modified Luxol-Cresyl protocol). The external features and the structure of the cerebellum were assessed and compared to literature data on other similar species (such as the rat and the rabbit). The macroscopic examination revealed that the chinchilla's cerebellum is well developed in size (average width of 2 cm) relative {{to the size of the}} encephalon (average width of 2. 4 cm). The cerebellar hemispheres are globulous, with a prominent paraflocculus and the vermis is very thick. The ratio between these segments resembles that of the rabbit's.

40|$|We used micro-infusions during eyelid {{conditioning}} in rabbits {{to investigate}} the relative contributions of cerebellar cortex and the underlying deep nuclei (DCN) to the expression of cerebellar learning. These tests were conducted using two forms of cerebellum-dependent eyelid conditioning for which the relative roles of cerebellar cortex and DCN are controversial: delay conditioning, which is largely unaffected by forebrain lesions, and trace conditioning, which involves interactions between forebrain and cerebellum. For rabbits trained with delay conditioning, silencing cerebellar cortex by micro-infusions of the local anesthetic lidocaine unmasked stereotyped short-latency responses. This was also the case after extinction as observed previously with reversible blockade of cerebellar cortex output. Conversely, increasing cerebellar cortex activity by micro-infusions of the GABA(A) antagonist picrotoxin reversibly abolished conditioned responses. Effective cannula placements were clustered around the <b>primary</b> <b>fissure</b> and deeper in lobules hemispheric lobule IV (HIV) and hemispheric lobule V (HV) of anterior lobe. In well-trained trace conditioned rabbits, silencing this same area of cerebellar cortex or reversibly blocking cerebellar cortex output also unmasked short-latency responses. Because Purkinje cells are the sole output of cerebellar cortex, these results provide evidence that the expression of well-timed conditioned responses requires a well-timed decrease in the activity of Purkinje cells in anterior lobe. The parallels between results from delay and trace conditioning suggest similar contributions of plasticity in cerebellar cortex and DCN in both instances...|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract In the fetal period, development of cerebellar lobes may proceed dissimilarly due to possible differenti-ated {{origins of the}} cells and diversified times of their migration to certain cerebellum regions. This can cause various growth trajectories for the external surfaces of cerebellar lobes. The goal {{of the study was}} to describe the development of the external surface of cerebellum lobes and fissures delineating them in the fetal period. The material consisted of 101 fetuses (48 males and 53 females) —crown rump length 89 – 229 mm corresponding to 15 – 28 weeks of fetal life. The methods were based on anthropometric measurements and preparation techniques combined with elicited image computer analysis. At the largest values of the cerebellum posterior lobe surface, the most dynamic growth rate was observed in the case of the anterior lobe. Among the cerebellar lobes, proportional change was observed as well as a gradual increase in anterior lobe surface area and a simultaneous decrease in the surface area of the flocculonodular lobe part of the cerebellum total external surface.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of different dietary levels of folic acid (FA) on postnatal cerebellar morphology, including the architecture and organisation of the various layers. A total of forty male OFA rats (a Sprague–Dawley strain), 5 weeks old, were classified into the following four dietary groups: FA deficient (0 mg/kg FA); FA supplemented (8 mg/kg FA); FA supra-supplemented (40 mg/kg FA); and control (2 mg/kg FA) (all n 10 per group). Rats were fed ad libitum for 30 d. The cerebellum was quickly removed and processed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Slides were immunostained for glial fibrillary acidic protein (to label Bergmann glia), calbindin (to label Purkinje cells) and NeuN (to label post-mitotic neurons). Microscopic analysis revealed two types of defect: partial disappearance of fissures and/or neuronal ectopia, primarily in supra-supplemented animals (incidence of 80 %, P≤ 0 · 01), but also in deficient and supplemented groups (incidence of 40 %, P≤ 0 · 05), compared with control animals. The <b>primary</b> <b>fissure</b> was predominantly affected, sometimes accompanied by defects in the secondary fissure.

Teeth were either grouped into one of six taxonomic categories or considered as individual cases. Univariate analysis of relative cusp areas shows that the two taxonomic categories of 'robust' hominids from East and Southern Africa have relatively small mesial cusps, but a relatively large entoconid and hypoconulid and Principal Component plots of the data show that the 'robust' categories can be distinguished on the basis of relative cusp size. Other evidence suggests that these differences {{are not likely to be}} the result of allometric phenomena. Fissure pattern was analysed using the X/Y coordinates of defined reference points. Patterns were compared by Procrustes analysis and the relationships between teeth contained in the resulting similarity matrix were portrayed using Principal Coordinates plots and a nearest neighbours table. The positions of the posterior fovea and the mesial longitudinal fissure were important for distinguishing taxonomic categories. The shape of the coronal profiles proved difficult to quantify, but there were consistent and distinct differences between the South African 'robust' sample and teeth included within the East African Homo category. When these results are combined with those of a previous study of overall crown size and the distribution of extra cusps, they allow the affinities of isolated teeth or contentious specimens to be assessed. For example, our results show that KNM-ER 1506 and 1802 are more similar to the East African Homo group than any other category, and they indicate that though SK 1587 and 1588 are small teeth, they nonetheless are closest to the South African 'robust' category in terms of relative cusp size, fissure pattern and crown profile shape.

40|$|The {{cerebellum}} {{is situated}} in the posterior part of the scull, dorsal to the brainstem and pontine nuclei (Fig. 1). Despite {{the fact that it}} is called “little brain” it harbors about half of the total number of neurons within the central nervous system (Kandel, 2003). The cerebellum is divided into an anterior lobe and a posterior lobe by the deep <b>primary</b> <b>fissure.</b> In addition, the posterior lobe is separated from the flocculonodular lobe by the posterolateral fissure. Transverse (interlobular) fissures divide the cerebellum further into 10 lobules (numbered I to X; Larsell, 1952; Larsell and Jansen, 1970). These lobules can be further sub divided by a various amount of foliation according to species (Figure 1). From medial to lateral, the cerebellum is divided into a vermis and a laterally positioned hemisphere. Amongst the two the paravermis or intermediate cerebellum is located, the organization and function of which will be the focus of this thesis. The cerebellum consists of a superficially located cortex, which, due to the impressive foliations reaches an enormous surface in the human. Deep in the white matter of the cerebellum the cerebellar nuclei are located which provide the output of the cerebellum. The cerebellum is connected to the brainstem by three cerebellar peduncles (superior, middle and inferior). Afferent connections (see 1. 3) are found in all three peduncles and contact neurons located in the cerebellar cortex and/or the cerebellar nuclei (see 1. 2 and 1. 4). Efferent fibers leave the cerebellum via the superior cerebellar peduncle or via the uncinate tracts. The Purkinje cell layer of the flocculonodular lobe projects directly to the vestibular nuclei. Functionally, the cerebellum is divided into three regions; the phylogenetically oldest one presumably is the vestibulocerebellum, which more or less equals the flocculonodular lobe, and is involved in controlling balance and eye movements. The second part anatomically consists of the vermis and paravermis and is referred to as the spinocerebellum due to the fact that it receives abundant somatosensory input from the spinal cord. It is thought to be mostly involved in reflexive and/or unconsciously executed motor control of the striated muscles. Finally, the cerebrocerebellum, consisting of most of the hemispheres, is phylogenetically the youngest addition to the cerebellum and receives its input almost exclusively related to and from the cerebral cortex. It is concerned with the planning, coordination and learning of complex movements but has also been implicated in cognitive functions (Schmahmann, 1991; Gao et al., 1996). The cells that make up the cerebellum, their in- and output relations and their possible functions will be addressed...|$|E
