As a Unitarian, Martineau welcomed the radical implications of transmutation of species, which was promoted by Grant and some medical men but anathema to Darwin's Anglican friends who saw it {{as a threat to the}} social order. Transmutation threatened the essential distinction between man and beast, and implied <b>progressive</b> <b>improvement</b> with the implication that the lower orders could aspire to the privileges of their aristocratic overlords.|$|E
500|$|The {{meaning of}} the Declaration was a {{recurring}} topic in the famed debates between Lincoln and Stephen Douglas in 1858. Douglas argued that the phrase [...] "all men are created equal" [...] in the Declaration referred to white men only. The purpose of the Declaration, he said, had simply been to justify {{the independence of the}} United States, and not to proclaim the equality of any [...] "inferior or degraded race". Lincoln, however, thought that the language of the Declaration was deliberately universal, setting a high moral standard to which the American republic should aspire. [...] "I had thought the Declaration contemplated the <b>progressive</b> <b>improvement</b> in the condition of all men everywhere," [...] he said. During the seventh and last joint debate with Steven Douglas at Alton, Illinois on October 15, 1858, Lincoln said about the declaration: ...|$|E

2500|$|Dr Robert Edmond Grant had {{graduated}} in 1814, and then studied anatomy with Georges Cuvier and embryology with Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in Paris. On returning in 1824 {{he was appointed}} lecturer in invertebrate animals at the private anatomy school set up by John Barclay and run by Robert Knox from 1826. His lectures there promoted Geoffroy's [...] "philosophical anatomy" [...] based on unity of plan compatible with the transmutation of species, implying ideas of <b>progressive</b> <b>improvement</b> and hence radical support for democracy. He was secretary of the Plinian, then in 1826 gave up that post to join the Council of the Wernerian Natural History Society. Plinian members helped with his pioneering work on marine invertebrates from the Firth of Forth, with Coldstream assisting him in 1825–1826.|$|E

Described by him as his [...] "favorite summer", his major league leading [...]353 batting average, 52 home runs, and 130 runs batted in brought home both the Triple Crown and first of three Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Awards. He also hit his second All-Star Game home run that season. During Game 5 of the 1956 World Series -- Don Larsen's perfect game against the Brooklyn Dodgers -- Mantle kept the perfect game alive by making a running catch of a deep fly ball off the bat of Gil Hodges, and provided {{the first of the}} two runs the Yankees would score with a fourth-inning home run off Brooklyn starter Sal Maglie, who had also been pitching a perfect game up till that point. Mantle's overall performance in 1956 was so exceptional he was bestowed the Hickok Belt (unanimously) as the top American professional athlete of the year. He is the only player to win a league Triple Crown as a switch hitter.|$|E

2500|$|The medical {{establishment}} controlling the London teaching hospitals, including the Royal College of Surgeons, {{was restricted to}} Anglicans and dominated by the aristocracy who saw perfect animal design as proof of a natural theology supporting their ideas of God-given rank and privilege. Since the 1820s large numbers of private medical schools joined by the new London University had introduced the [...] "philosophical anatomy" [...] of Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire based on unity of plan compatible with the transmutation of species, implying ideas of <b>progressive</b> <b>improvement</b> and supporting radical demands for democracy. This anatomy had already spread from Paris to the medical schools of Edinburgh, and the new London schools attracted Scots, including Grant. Numerous journals now promoted these radical ideas, including Thomas Wakley's The Lancet (started in 1823 with support from William Cobbett and William Lawrence, whose 1819 publication of evolutionary ideas the Crown had prosecuted for blasphemy). In response, the {{medical establishment}} gave support to the idealist biology of Joseph Henry Green (1791–1863) and of his younger protégé Richard Owen (1804–1892), based on the vitalism of German Naturphilosophie and Platonic idealism, which saw anatomical forms as [...] "archetypes" [...] in the Divine mind, imposed through [...] "descensive" [...] powers of delegation of divine authority in accordance with traditional hierarchies.|$|E
2500|$|There was a <b>progressive</b> <b>improvement</b> in horsemanship {{during the}} summer and autumn of 1916 {{indicated}} by the small number of animals evacuated from the Anzac Mounted Division after the strenuous marching and fighting from August following the Battle of Romani and during the capture of El Arish and the Battle of Magdaba. This improvement was augmented by regular inspections by administrative veterinary officers when the advice offered was followed by regimental commanders. During the year the average loss of sick horses and mules from the Sinai front was approximately 640 per week. They were transported in train loads of thirty trucks, each holding eight horses. Animals which died or were destroyed while on active service were buried [...] from the nearest camp unless this was not practicable. In this case the carcasses were transported to suitable sites away from troops, where they were disembowelled and left to disintegrate in the dry desert air and high temperatures. Animals which died or were destroyed in veterinary units at Kantara, Ismalia, Bilbeis, and Quesna were dealt with in this way and after four days' drying in the sun, the carcases were stuffed with straw and burnt, after the skins were salved. These were sold to local contractors.|$|E
