5|$|Hester {{began his}} {{professional}} {{career in the}} National Football League with the Chicago Bears, who selected him {{in the second round}} of the 2006 NFL Draft with the 57th overall pick. The team originally drafted Hester as a cornerback, but they intended to <b>play</b> <b>him</b> as a return specialist, following the retirement of Jerry Azumah, and departure of Bobby Wade. The team's decision to draft Hester was initially criticized by fans and sports analysts, who believed the Bears should have spent their early picks on offensive prospects.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the only}} certain cast member {{for the show}} was Peter Sallis. Clarke had already collaborated on a few scripts with him and the {{character}} of Norman Clegg was created especially for Sallis, who liked the character and agreed to <b>play</b> <b>him.</b> He was soon joined by an actor he had previously worked with, Michael Bates as Cyril Blamire.|$|E
5|$|Coltrane was the Simpsons fourth cat, {{adopted from}} an animal shelter {{shortly after the}} death of Snowball III. Lisa is not certain she wants another cat, but her other one has haunted her and Coltrane name wins her over due to its {{resemblance}} of jazz musician John Coltrane's name. Upon bringing Coltrane home, Lisa decides to <b>play</b> <b>him</b> some of John Coltrane music on her saxophone, but the noise frightens him and he commits suicide by jumping out the window. Coltrane was the Simpsons only cat since Snowball I to have been white, although {{he was the only one}} not to be named Snowball. However, Lisa evidently considers him as part of the Snowball lineage, as she names her next cat Snowball V, implying that Coltrane was Snowball IV.|$|E

5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear weather greeted {{the players on}} the second day. After only four overs had been bowled in total the previous afternoon, Edrich was relieved of the new ball, which was given to Barnett, who accompanied Bedser. Both bowlers swung the ball into the right-handed Barnes and away from the left-handed Morris. Not a frontline bowler, Barnett focused on bowling defensively at medium pace, and the Australians wanted to make a safe start, so they decided to <b>play</b> <b>him</b> watchfully. This prompted some commentators to claim Barnett had allowed the Australians to settle into their rhythm by not trying to pressure them.|$|E
5|$|Australia dropped Bill Brown, who {{had scored}} 73 runs at a batting average of 24.33 in three Test innings during the season. Brown was Australia's reserve opener, but Bradman opted to <b>play</b> <b>him</b> out of {{position}} in the middle-order, instead of using a specialist. Brown had also struggled in his unfamiliar position in the matches against Worcestershire and the Marylebone Cricket Club, scoring 25 and 26. According to O'Reilly, Brown had appeared {{out of place in}} the middle-order because he was used to the opener's classical role of defending against and wearing down the opening bowlers, rather than attacking. He was replaced by the all rounder Sam Loxton, who had hammered an unbeaten 159—including several sixes—against Gloucestershire, and that innings was particularly noted for his quick footwork, which he used to charge and attack the off spin of Tom Goddard.|$|E
5|$|For the 2010–11 season, the Rockets {{said they}} would limit Yao to 24 minutes a game, with no plan to <b>play</b> <b>him</b> on {{back-to-back}} nights. Their goal was to keep Yao healthy in the long term. On December 16, 2010, {{it was announced that}} Yao had developed a stress fracture in his left ankle, related to an older injury, and would miss the rest of the season. In January 2011, he was voted as the Western Conference starting center for the 2011 All-Star Game for the eighth time in nine seasons. Injured All-Stars are usually required to attend the All-Star functions and to be introduced at the game, but Yao was not in Los Angeles because of his rehabilitation schedule after his surgery. Yao's contract with the Rockets expired {{at the end of the}} season, and he became a free agent.|$|E

50|$|Colin Murphy is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American soap opera Days of Our Lives. He was played by two actors. Robert Cuthill <b>played</b> <b>him</b> from July 2001 through October 2001.

5|$|Ironically, manager John Sillett {{spent much}} of the money from Coventry's FA Cup run (£750,000) on Chelsea striker David Speedie, who would replace Houchen in front of goal. Sillett's one {{consolation}} to Houchen was that he would <b>play</b> <b>him</b> in the 1987 FA Charity Shield, which ended in a 1–0 defeat to Everton. The 1987–88 season was poor for both club and player, as illness, injury and competition from Speedie, Gary Bannister and Cyrille Regis restricted Houchen to just three goals and 24 appearances. On 14 August 1988, he was selected by Graham Taylor to represent the Football League in a game against Scunthorpe United to celebrate the opening of Glanford Park; Houchen scored once in a 6–1 victory. He scored just twice in sixteen appearances in 1988–89, though one of these goals was the winner against Midlands rivals Aston Villa in a 2–1 Boxing Day victory at Highfield Road. He also featured as a substitute in the infamous 2–1 defeat to Conference club Sutton United at Gander Green Lane. The result was all the more remarkable considering that Coventry went on to finish seventh in the league and that Houchen was one of ten Coventry players that day who had won the FA Cup less than two years previously.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United brought Giggs on at {{the start}} of extra time, the Welshman taking Fletcher's place in the midfield. They {{immediately}} tried to <b>play</b> <b>him</b> in down the left wing, but the pass was over-hit and went beyond Giggs. Arsenal finally got their first shot on target in the seventh minute of extra time, when a Van Persie free kick – awarded for a foul by Silvestre – forced a diving save from Carroll. Four minutes later, Manchester United appealed for a penalty kick when a cross from Giggs struck Cole, but replays showed that the ball hit the Arsenal full-back in the midriff. United sustained their attack, and the ball came to Scholes in the penalty area, but his shot on the turn was well saved by Lehmann. The resultant corner was taken short by Scholes, before it was played back to him; his cross found Van Nistelrooy unmarked in the area, but the Dutchman headed over the bar {{from the edge of the}} goal area. United then had another penalty shout when Giggs volleyed a long ball from Scholes into Touré's body and up onto the Ivorian's hand, but referee Rob Styles turned their claims down. Arsenal then brought on Edu to replace Pirès for the remaining 15 minutes.|$|E
5|$|McBreen was {{prepared}} to return to Australia before being offered a trial with Falkirk of the Scottish First Division. He also played for English Conference South club St Albans City in pre-season before Falkirk received international clearance to <b>play</b> <b>him</b> in September 2004. McBreen made his debut as a 73rd-minute substitute for Andy Thomson in a 3–0 home win over Gretna in the Scottish Challenge Cup on 14 September 2004. He came on as a 72nd-minute substitute for Thomson in the 2004 Scottish Challenge Cup Final, in which Falkirk beat Ross County 2–1 at McDiarmid Park on 7 November 2004. His first goal came on his first start for the club, with a shot from eightyards seconds before half-time, as Falkirk beat Raith Rovers 2–0 away on 13 November 2004. This marked {{the start of a}} run of nine goals from seven matches, and come {{the end of the season}} McBreen and his strike partner Darryl Duffy had scored a combined total of 40 goals. He finished 2004–05 with 13 goals from 26 matches as Falkirk were promoted to the Scottish Premier League as Scottish First Division champions. His 13 league goals saw him ranked as the division's fourth highest scorer.|$|E

5|$|Watts was {{recruited}} by the Melbourne Football Club with the first overall selection in the 2008 national draft. Drafted at seventeen years of age, {{he was in the}} last draft where a player could be recruited at seventeen, with the AFL requiring that, effective from the 2009 AFL draft, a player must turn at least eighteen years of age in the year they are drafted. The hype placed on him by the club was high when he was presented with the number four guernsey by six-time Melbourne premiership player, Ron Barassi—a guernsey number previously worn by club legend and the winner of ten premierships with the club as a player and coach, Norm Smith—in a ceremony at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) two days after being drafted. Completing year twelve in 2009, the need to manage school with football saw the club electing to not <b>play</b> <b>him</b> in pre-season matches during the NAB Cup.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the winter}} break, Diarra {{struggled}} with a thigh injury and didn't appear {{with the team}} for almost three months. In March 2007, he finally returned to the team in its 3–1 win over Derby du Rhône rivals Saint-Étienne appearing as a substitute. During the season, Diarra complained twice with regards to playing time, which led to Houllier equivocally questioning Diarra's ego. The feud culminated on 6 April when Houllier dropped Diarra from the squad to face Valenciennes the following day and then ordered him {{to play for the}} club's reserve team in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth level of French football. Diarra refused the orders and Houllier responded by reportedly threatening not to <b>play</b> <b>him</b> {{for the rest of the}} season. The Lyon manager later stated the Diarra should issue an apology to him and the team. The defensive midfielder did not budge and, subsequently, missed the team's next four league matches, as well as the 2007 Coupe de la Ligue Final. Diarra returned to the team on 28 April playing the entire match in a 3–1 win over Le Mans. He repeated this feat in three of the team's last five matches as Lyon were crowned champions for the sixth consecutive season. Included in one of those three matches was Diarra's first league goal for the club, which came in a 3–0 victory over his former club Lens.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs {{began the}} 1909 {{season with a}} {{succession}} of large scores, including a double century in one match and two separate centuries in another. Such form placed him in contention for {{a place in the}} England team to play Australia that year, despite the English batting strength. But the England captain, Archie MacLaren, was unconvinced that Hobbs possessed the required quality. The Surrey captain and England selector H. D. G. Leveson Gower persuaded the committee to include Hobbs in the squad, then convinced a reluctant MacLaren to <b>play</b> <b>him</b> in the team. In the first Test, played at Edgbaston, Hobbs opened the batting with MacLaren but was dismissed from the first ball he received. The match was a low-scoring one, and Australia set England 105 runs to win. Hobbs, this time opening the batting with C. B. Fry, hit 62 not out and England passed the target without losing a wicket. England lost the next two matches, and Hobbs was unsuccessful, with a top-score of 30 in four innings. A badly injured finger meant that he missed the remainder of the Test series; in three games, he scored 132 runs at an average of 26.40. England lost the series when the remaining two matches were drawn. Hobbs struggled to regain his form when he recovered; he averaged 40.65 for the season, but of the 2,114 first-class runs he scored, nearly half came in the first month of the season.|$|E

25|$|In July 2010, he was {{selected}} for the Twenty20 series against Australia but the selectors decided not to <b>play</b> <b>him</b> in the Test squad {{so that he would}} not get injured. He was subsequently selected for the ODI and Twenty20 series against England in September 2010.|$|E
50|$|Piacenza {{thought his}} time was over, so they sold {{him to the}} club which had not <b>played</b> <b>him,</b> Milan. This time, Milan <b>played</b> <b>him</b> in half of the 1997-98 season's games as a backup to {{teammate}} Sebastiano Rossi. Then Milan sold him to Venezia in 1998. In his first season with Venezia, he played in nearly every game.|$|R

25|$|He {{was used}} {{primarily}} {{on special teams}} until injuries to Marion Barber forced the team to <b>play</b> <b>him</b> against the Pittsburgh Steelers, {{who at the time}} had the best defense in the NFL. Choice surprised by registering 23 carries for 88yards, and five receptions for 78yards.|$|E
25|$|When {{he fails}} to score, however, his overall {{contribution}} to the team is sometimes questioned. Manager Walter Smith occasionally chose not to <b>play</b> <b>him</b> owing to his lack of contribution to the overall team performance. With Smith's common 4–5–1 formation, Boyd was not seen {{to be an effective}} lone striker.|$|E
25|$|Johnson’s {{offensive}} upside {{was such}} that his coaches would occasionally <b>play</b> <b>him</b> on the left wing, as against the Kenora Thistles in a 1907 challenge match. Si Griffis, playing for the Thistles at the time, claimed that it was Johnson’s play which determined the Wanderers’ victory. In six playoff games that year, Johnson scored five goals.|$|E
