The Murder of Lee Oswald uncovers, in the condensed black satire, complex links people only could sense but, then, couldn't <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>words.</b> Two pictures – made when it happened – who went against the grain of mainstream media and which today has a prophetic force. Bertrand Russell wrote appreciatively to Torsten Billman about these two grisaille woodcuts.|$|E

Hoffman signed a $13.5 million, two-year contract that included a club option for 2008. [...] "It came down to me making a decision for my family and not disrupting what we have going on", said Hoffman.

Television network executives and commentators responded with outrage. Julian Goodman, president of NBC, stated that Agnew had made an [...] "appeal to prejudice... it is regrettable that the Vice President of the United States should deny to TV freedom of the press". Frank Stanton, head of CBS, accused Agnew of trying to intimidate the news media, and his news anchor, Walter Cronkite, agreed. The speech was praised by conservatives from both parties, and gave Agnew a following among the right. Agnew deemed the Des Moines speech one of his finest moments.|$|E

500|$|Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} the episode for Tor.com, {{giving it a}} rating of two out of ten. He said that it resembled the [...] episode [...] "The Counter-Clock Incident", and that the first act of [...] "Rascals" [...] was compelling. However, he said [...] "It’s difficult to <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>words</b> how appallingly stupid the entire episode becomes {{from the moment the}} Birds of Prey decloak to the end." [...] He criticized the ability of the Ferengi to take over the Enterprise, calling them [...] "spectacularly idiotic" [...] with Picard's plan requiring them to be [...] "dumber than a box of hammers". He said that the only reason why the episode was given a score as high as two was because of the effectiveness of the scene with Miles and Keiko.|$|E
500|$|While {{working for}} AVALANCHE, Cloud {{encounters}} Aerith Gainsborough, {{a resident of}} Midgar's slums. Agreeing to serve as her bodyguard {{in exchange for a}} date, Cloud helps Aerith evade Shinra, who pursue her because she is the sole survivor of a race known as the Cetra. Aerith notes that Cloud reminds her of an old boyfriend of hers, who is implied to be Zack Fair. During the course of their travels, a love triangle develops between Cloud, Tifa and Aerith, often exploited to humorous effect. Dialogue choices impact the strength of Cloud's relationship with Tifa and Aerith, as well as with Barret and Yuffie Kisaragi. These interactions determine who accompanies Cloud through the Gold Saucer, an amusement park. If Aerith joins Cloud, she reflects on how strongly Cloud's physical appearance and mannerisms resemble Zack's, and struggles to <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>words</b> how she is still [...] "searching for [...] ". Irrespective of who accompanies Cloud at the Gold Saucer, how the player interacts with Tifa may also result in a more sexually suggestive scene playing out during the night she spends with Cloud before the game's conclusion. Tifa worries instead that the party saw, rather than overheard, the two the morning after.|$|E

In his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, he stays generally within the realm of logical positivism until claim 6.4—but at 6.41 and following, he argues that ethics and several other issues are [...] "transcendental" [...] subjects that we cannot examine with language. Wittgenstein also mentions the will, life after death, and God—arguing that, [...] "When the answer cannot be <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>words,</b> neither can the question be put into words." ...|$|E

2500|$|Renaissance humanism was an {{intellectual}} movement in Europe {{of the later}} Middle Ages and the Early Modern period.

Paul Johnson agrees that Petrarch was [...] "the first to <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>words</b> {{the notion that the}} centuries between the fall of Rome and the present had been the age of Darkness". According to Petrarch, what was needed to remedy this situation was the careful study and imitation of the great classical authors.

The album was a commercial success and has sold over 250,000 copies, a breakthrough for the label and for all of the band's peers at that time. Oberst stated that, before making this record, both he and Mike Mogis had an idea for a [...] "sort of grandiose sound" [...] that neither could really <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>words.</b> This was also the first album made after Oberst's break to play with Desaparecidos.|$|E

As early as August 2005, Internet rumors began to circulate that the album would be released in January 2006 although the band's management denied the claims. Thanks to Hoppus and Barker's silence on press interviews, misinformation flooded the Internet in the {{months prior to the}} record's release, such as countless impostors posting fake songs online. [...] "It's kind of flattering that some kids would go out there and post songs under our name," [...] Barker added. [...] "I mean, at least it means that people are excited to hear our stuff." [...] "No, It Isn't" [...] leaked in December 2005 and caused speculation as it addressed the break-up of Blink-182 head-on. Hoppus did not give any formal interviews before shortly prior to the release of the album, instead spending time updating his blog, producing tracks for Motion City Soundtrack, and working on the album in relative secrecy. [...] "During that time, their former bandmate, Tom DeLonge, did the opposite, peppering blogs and magazines with quotes hyping his new band and putting the blame for the Blink situation squarely on their shoulders," [...] reported James Montgomery of MTV News. While it [...] "pained" [...] them to do so, Hoppus and Barker refrained from speaking to media, instead burying themselves in the studio in the recording of the album. [...] "We just bit our tongues and didn't say anything, and now that the record is done, we get the chance to tell the truth about everything," [...] Hoppus said. [...] "We were silent for a year, and we couldn't <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>words</b> what we were doing, so we just decided not to say anything and let the music speak for itself," [...] Barker added.
