These weights and rigid pieces also enable the whip to be reversed and used as a bludgeon. As the incorporation of heavy, metallic, sizeable and blunt elements in a whip increases, it shifts towards becoming a flail, morning star or meteor hammer <b>type</b> of <b>mace.</b>|$|R

40|$|Objectives This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the outcomes of paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) and sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) in a contemporaneous cohort of real-world patients. Background A number of randomized comparisons of PES and SES have shown unequivocal advantages for SES in anglographic end points such as late loss. However, the data on clinical outcomes are less consistent. Methods All consecutive patients successfully treated with only SES or PES in de novo native vessel lesions between March 2003 and March 2005 were analyzed. Our end points were major adverse cardiac events (MACE), a composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), target vessel revascularization (TVR), and target lesion revascularization (TLR). We also analyzed late loss and angiographic restenosis. Results There were 609 patients (1, 064 lesions) treated with PES and 674 patients (1, 205 lesions) treated with SES. Diabetes mellitus was present in 26. 8 % of patients and multivessel disease in 75 % of patients. Bifurcations made up 16. 3 % of lesions, chronic occlusions 9. 5 %, left main 4. 8 %, and American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology type B 2 /C 75. 4 %. Despite a higher late loss in the PES group (p = 0. 0001), there were no differences in anglographic restenosis (PES 18 % vs. SES 17. 8 %, p = 0. 95), TLR (PES 11. 9 % vs. SES 11 %, p 0. 47), or MACE (PES 21. 3 % vs. SES 21. 1 %, p = 0. 95). The relative risk of MACE for the PES group was 1. 02 (95 % confidence interval [Cl] 0. 78 to 1. 33). Multivariable analysis confirmed the lack of association of stent <b>type</b> with <b>MACE</b> (odds ratio 1. 03 [95 % Cl 0. 77 to 1. 38], p = 0. 83) and TLR (odds ratio 1. 08 [95 % Cl 0. 81 to 1. 44], p = 0. 61).

The forest wallaby has especially been noted in grassland, in open forest with only little logging activity and in undisturbed closed forest.

40|$|Background: Lung Tuberculosis {{is caused}} by {{pathogen}} bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis and has infected {{a third of the}} world population. The incidence of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in industrialized countries for the last 40 years indicates that prevalence rate is very small, whereas 95 % of the sufferers in developing countries are approximately 8 million people. They are infected by Pulmonary Tuberculosis with 3 million of death rate per year. Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Indonesia according to WHO (1999 and 2004), is as many as 583, 000 cases: 140, 000 for death and 13 / 100. 000 people are new patients.  Papua province in 2007 has the number of new patients with smear Basil (BTA) (+) amounting 1535 patients, {{more than half of the}} patients are those who are between 15 - 45 years of age or equal to 933 cases. If such a condition continues, Papua Province will lose productive human resources. Methods: This research was aimed to determine risk factors of physical environment in housing and regional characteristics of pulmonary tuberculosis in the working area of Public Health Centre, Sentani, Jayapura Regency, <b>Papua</b> Province. <b>Type</b> of the study was an observational study with case control approach. Subjects of the research were 106 respondents, consisting of 53 cases and 53 controls.  Statistical analysis was done by Chi-square test, the relationship of risk factors with the occurrence of tuberculosis (by using univariate and bivariate analysis), and then multivariate analysis with logistic regression test. Results: The result of bivariate analysis showed that there is a relationship between factors type of house (p = 0, 031), natural lighting (p = 0. 004), the existence among of direct sunlight (p = 0. 020), house ventilation (p = 0. 020), bedroom ventilation (p = 0. 003),  humidity of bedroom (p = 0. 000), temperature of bedroom (p = 0. 000), house density  (0, 004), and type of house floor (0. 001), whereas the result of multivariate analysis shows that risk factors for pulmonary tuberculosis is bedroom ventilation (OR = 16. 949), temperature of bedroom (OR = 8. 913), and type of house floor (OR = 4. 575), and as protective factor is house ventilation (OR = 0. 036).

40|$|Objectives: The {{electrocardiograph}} (ECG) is {{an essential}} tool in initial management and risk stratification of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A six-point reporting criterion has been proposed to facilitate standardized clinical assessment of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected ACS. We set out to evaluate the efficacy of these criteria in identifying patients with major adverse cardiac events (<b>MACE),</b> <b>Type</b> 1 myocardial infarction (T 1 MI), Type 2 myocardial infarction (T 2 MI), and 1 -year mortality in a cohort of emergency patients with chest pain. Methods: This was an analysis of data from 2, 349 patients who presented to the ED with chest pain between 2008 and 2013. Data were collected as part of two prospective trials. ECGs were recorded at presentation and categorized according to the six-point criteria by local cardiologists blinded to all clinical information. The primary outcome was 30 -day MACE, including T 1 MI, T 2 MI, unstable angina pectoris, revascularization, and 30 -day mortality. The outcome was adjudicated by cardiologists {{on the basis of}} all clinical information and test results. Likelihood ratios and odds ratios for 30 -day MACE were reported for each ECG category. Results: Major adverse cardiac events were diagnosed in 264 (11. 3 %) patients. Increasing ischemic abnormalities in ECGs, as categorized by the standardized reporting criteria, were associated with increasing rates of MACE. Within 30 days, T 1 MI occurred in 148 (6. 3 %) patients and T 2 MI occurred in 59 (2. 5 %) patients. Risk for T 1 MI increased with higher classification of ECG abnormalities. T 2 MI rates were highest in patients with ECGs of nonspecific changes. Conclusions: The rates of MACE, T 1 MI, and 1 -year death can be stratified according to standardized ECG criteria in patients presenting to the ED with chest pain. The ECG findings in patients with T 2 MI are variable, and the ECG is less helpful in defining risk in this group...|$|R
