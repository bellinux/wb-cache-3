25|$|Temporarily {{buoyed by}} an inheritance, Nancarrow {{traveled}} to New York City in 1947 {{and bought a}} custom-built manual <b>punching</b> <b>machine</b> to enable him to punch the piano rolls. The machine was an adaptation of one used in the commercial production of rolls, and using {{it was very hard}} work and very slow. He also adapted the player pianos, increasing their dynamic range by tinkering with their mechanism and covering the hammers with leather (in one player piano) and metal (in the other) so as to produce a more percussive sound. On this trip to New York, he met Cowell and heard a performance of John Cage's Sonatas and Interludes for prepared piano (also influenced by Cowell's aesthetics), which would later lead to Nancarrow's modestly experimenting with prepared piano in his Study No. 30.|$|E
60|$|But if Mrs Marrot's {{surprise}} at the scissors was great, not less great was it at the <b>punching</b> <b>machine,</b> which punched little buttons {{the size of a}} sixpence out of cold iron full half-an-inch thick. This vicious implement not only punched holes all round boiler-plates so as to permit of their being riveted together, but it cut patterns out of thick iron plates by punching rows of such holes so close to each other that they formed one long cutting, straight or crooked, as might be required. In short, the <b>punching</b> <b>machine</b> acted the part of a saw, and cut the iron plates in any shape that was desired. Here also they saw the testing of engine springs--those springs which to most people appear to have no spring in them whatever--so very powerful are they. One of these was laid on an iron table, with its two ends resting against an iron plate. A man approached and measured it exactly. Then a hydraulic ram was applied; and there was something quite impressive in the easy quiet way, in which the ram shoved a spring, which the weight of a locomotive can scarcely affect, quite flat against the iron plate, and held it there a moment or two! Being released, the spring resumed its proper form. It was then re-measured; found not to have expanded a hair's-breadth, and, therefore,--as Will Garvie took care to explain,-- was passed as a sound well-tempered spring; whereat Bob remarked that it would need to be a good-tempered spring, to suffer such treatment without grumbling.|$|E

40|$|The {{developed}} hybrid laser-assisted shearing process enables conventional <b>punching</b> <b>machines</b> {{to produce}} punch-sheared edges with continuous clear-cut surfaces in {{stainless steel plates}} (1. 4301), spring steel plates (1. 4310), and titanium alloy plates (3. 7165). The new combination of localized laser-induced softening of the plate material in the shearing zone and the shearing process significantly reduces both process forces and process-related noise emissions. Laser-assisted shearing of stainless steel plates (1. 4301, material thickness, 3 mm) and titanium plates (TiAl 6 V 4; material thickness, 3 mm) leads to clear-cut surface ratios of 90 %. The cutting forces are reduced by over 70 %. The process-related noise level is reduced by over 10 dB(A). In terms of the laser-assisted shearing of spring steel plates, the achievable clear-cut surface ratios are 100 % of the material thickness (materials, 1. 1248 and 1. 4310; material thickness, 3 mm). Here, the cutting forces are reduced by 80 %.
