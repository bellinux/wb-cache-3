40|$|Abstract: The paper {{contains}} {{primary data}} based {{analysis on the}} energy consumption aspect of battery operated auto-rickshaws {{which is one of}} the crucial issues in the transportation system of a developing country like Bangladesh. Several aspects associated with the mode such as its energy consumption rate, effects of recharging of the mode on local town’s energy provision capacity, and the mode’s contribution in attenuation of transport related emissions are explored in the paper. The paper with scientific research outcomes would provide guidelines to the policy makers of a country regarding whether and how to incorporate the mode in the local town’s transportation system. Battery operated auto-rickshaw offers lower travel cost than rickshaw and greater travel comfort than other urban <b>para-transits</b> like auto tempo, nosimon and public transport like minibus, and therefore attracts urban passengers significantly from those modes. Around 88 % of people living in a city where battery operated auto-rickshaws are available, use the mode now to meet their travel demand. Through attracting passengers from fuel operated vehicles, thus the mode replaces them at great extent. A considerable percentage of daily electricity demand of local towns is consumed by the mode which creates pressure on local electricity supply in turn. However, considering the duration and period of load shedding caused due to recharging the mode, energy consumption by the mode can be negotiated as the mode is liable only for 1. 53 hours of load shedding a day which takes place at off-peak period (between 11 : 00 PM and 7 : 00 AM) at night...|$|R
