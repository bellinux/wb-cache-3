It was managed by the Wythenshawe and North Cheshire Hospital Management Committee A women's surgical department and two geriatric wards were opened. Baguley continued to deal with TB, but changed its name from sanatorium to hospital. It had about 400 beds. Bed rest and fresh air were still the main treatment but chemotherapy was being tried.

40|$|That {{para-aminobenzoic acid}} antagonizes {{competitively}} the inhibitory effect of <b>para-aminosalicylic</b> acid {{on the growth}} of Mycobac-terium tuberculosis is well known. In a previous communication (Hedgecock, 1956) it was re-ported that inhibition of M. tuberculosis (strain H 37 Rv) by <b>para-aminosalicylic</b> acid was re-versed noncompetitively by methionine and biotin when the concentration of the inhibitor did not exceed 0. 5,ug per ml. At higher concen-trations of <b>para-aminosalicylic</b> acid, reversal of inhibition occurred {{in the presence of}} methionine and biotin following the addition of certain fatty acids or purines as well as specified amino acids. In the present paper competitive and noncom-petitive reversal of <b>para-aminosalicylic</b> acid-inhibition was investigated in susceptible and resistant strains of M. tuberculosis which had been isolated from patients and also in resistant strains selected in vitro. Studies of the organisms were made with respect to the mechanisms in-volved in the development of resistance to <b>para-aminosalicylic</b> acid. MATERIALS AND METHODS The original susceptible and resistant strains of M. tuberculosis utilized in this investigation had been isolated from patients.

40|$|Hypersensitivity {{reactions}} against <b>para-aminosalicylic</b> acid {{have been}} recorded frequently lEt the literature. It {{is the purpose of}} this report to emphasise the possible occurrence of severe reactions which may result in death if unrecognised. Unlike the chest physician, the orthopaedic surgeon may be unfamiliar with these reactions because he uses the drug much less frequently. Experience with three cases, two of which may well have proved fatal from acute liver damage, prompted the writing of this report. A comprehensive review ofthe subject by Simpson and Walker (1960) quotes an incidence of hypersensitivity reactions in up to 5 per cent of patients receiving <b>para-aminosalicylic</b> acid. A double reaction to both <b>para-aminosalicylic</b> acid and streptomycin is sometimes found, but concurrent hypersensitivity to <b>para-aminosalicylic</b> acid, streptomycin and isoniazid is rare. CLINICAL FEATURES The clinical presentation of the condition resembles a typical allergic reaction, with the possibility of malaise and headaches, rigors, skin irritation and a “ gritty “ conjunctivitis.

We report {{here for the}} first time an in vitro therapeutic effect of nanocomposites based on <b>para-aminosalicylic</b> acid with zinc layered hydroxide (PAS-ZLH) and zinc-aluminum layered double hydroxides (PAS-Zn/Al LDH), against mycobacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria.

40|$|Tuberculosis is {{a lethal}} epidemic, {{difficult}} to control disease, claiming thousands of lives every year. We have developed a nanodelivery formulation based on <b>para-aminosalicylic</b> acid (PAS) and zinc layered hydroxide using zinc nitrate salt as a precursor.

The newly developed formulation was also found active against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and Candida albicans.

40|$|Background: The {{emergence}} {{of resistance to}} anti-tuberculosis drugs is a serious and growing threat to public health. Next-generation sequencing is rapidly gaining traction as a diagnostic tool for investigating drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis to aid treatment decisions. However, there are few little data regarding the precision of such sequencing for assigning resistance profiles. Methods: We investigated two sequencing platforms (Illumina MiSeq, Ion Torrent PGM™) and two rapid analytic pipelines (TBProfiler, Mykrobe predictor) using a well characterised reference strain (H 37 Rv) and clinical isolates from patients with tuberculosis resistant to up to 13 drugs. Results were compared to phenotypic drug susceptibility testing. To assess analytical robustness individual DNA samples were subjected to repeated sequencing. Results: The MiSeq and Ion PGM systems accurately predicted drug-resistance profiles and there was high reproducibility between biological and technical sample replicates. Estimated variant error rates were low (MiSeq 1 per 77 kbp, Ion PGM 1 per 41 kbp) and genomic coverage high (MiSeq 51 -fold, Ion PGM 53 -fold). MiSeq provided superior coverage in GC-rich regions, which translated into incremental detection of putative genotypic drug-specific resistance, including for resistance to <b>para-aminosalicylic</b> acid and pyrazinamide. The TBProfiler bioinformatics pipeline was concordant with reported phenotypic susceptibility for all drugs tested except pyrazinamide and <b>para-aminosalicylic</b> acid, with an overall concordance of 95. 3 %. When using the Mykrobe predictor concordance with phenotypic testing was 73. 6 %. Conclusions: We have demonstrated high comparative reproducibility of two sequencing platforms, and high predictive ability of the TBProfiler mutation library and analytical pipeline, when profiling resistance to first- and second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. However, platform-specific variability in coverage of some genome regions may have implications for predicting resistance to specific drugs. These findings may have implications for future clinical practice and thus deserve further scrutiny, set within larger studies and using updated mutation libraries...|$|E
