40|$|In {{this paper}} we refine {{the process of}} {{computing}} <b>calibration</b> <b>functions</b> {{for a number of}} multiclass classification surrogate losses. <b>Calibration</b> <b>functions</b> are a powerful tool for easily converting bounds for the surrogate risk (which can be computed through well-known methods) into bounds for the true risk, the probability of making a mistake. They are particularly suitable in non-parametric settings, where the approximation error can be controlled, and provide tighter bounds than the common technique of upper-bounding the 0 - 1 loss by the surrogate loss. The abstract nature of the more sophisticated existing <b>calibration</b> <b>function</b> results requires <b>calibration</b> <b>functions</b> to be explicitly derived on a case-by-case basis, requiring repeated efforts whenever bounds for a new surrogate loss are required. We devise a streamlined analysis that simplifies the process of deriving <b>calibration</b> <b>functions</b> for a large number of surrogate losses that have been proposed in the literature. The effort of deriving <b>calibration</b> <b>functions</b> is then surmised in verifying, for a chosen surrogate loss, a small number of conditions that we introduce. As case studies, we recover existing <b>calibration</b> <b>functions</b> for the well-known loss of Lee et al. (2004), and also provide novel <b>calibration</b> <b>functions</b> for well-known losses, including the one-versus-all loss and the logistic regression loss, plus a number of other losses that {{have been shown to be}} classification-calibrated in the past, but for which no <b>calibration</b> <b>function</b> had been derived.

This method utilizes the relative thermal expansion of two diffraction peaks, either for peaks from a mixture of phases, or from a single phase that has anisotropic thermal expansion. A <b>calibration</b> <b>function</b> is derived from data at many temperatures and collected over a narrow angular range. Because only the relative separations of closely spaced peaks are used, this method is fast and insensitive to geometric aberrations.

40|$|Among lidar techniques, {{the pure}} {{rotational}} Raman (PRR) technique {{is the best}} suited for tropospheric and lower stratospheric temperature measurements. <b>Calibration</b> <b>functions</b> are required for the PRR technique to retrieve temperature profiles from lidar remote sensing data. Both temperature retrieval accuracy and number of calibration coefficients depend on the selected function. The commonly used <b>calibration</b> <b>function</b> (linear in reciprocal temperature 1 ∕ T with two calibration coefficients) ignores all types of broadening of individual PRR lines of atmospheric N 2 and O 2 molecules. However, the collisional (pressure) broadening dominates over other types of broadening of PRR lines in the troposphere and can differently affect the accuracy of tropospheric temperature measurements depending on the PRR lidar system. We recently derived the <b>calibration</b> <b>function</b> in the general analytical form {{that takes into account}} the collisional broadening of all N 2 and O 2 PRR lines (Gerasimov and Zuev, 2016). This general <b>calibration</b> <b>function</b> represents an infinite series and, therefore, cannot be directly used in the temperature retrieval algorithm. For this reason, its four simplest special cases (<b>calibration</b> <b>functions</b> nonlinear in 1 ∕ T with three calibration coefficients), two of which have not been suggested before, were considered and analyzed. All the special cases take the collisional PRR lines broadening into account in varying degrees and the best function among them was determined via simulation. In this paper, we use the special cases to retrieve tropospheric temperature from real PRR lidar data. The <b>calibration</b> <b>function</b> best suited for tropospheric temperature retrievals is determined from the comparative analysis of temperature uncertainties yielded by using these functions. The absolute and relative statistical uncertainties of temperature retrieval are given in an analytical form assuming Poisson statistics of photon counting. The vertical tropospheric temperature profiles, retrieved from nighttime lidar measurements in Tomsk (56. 48 ° N, 85. 05 ° E; Western Siberia, Russia) on 2  October  2014 and 1  April  2015, are presented {{as an example of the}} <b>calibration</b> <b>functions</b> application.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{general purpose}} of this study is the {{determination}} of J-integral when dealing with fracture of a penny-shaped crack on the end of the stiff cylindrical cord embedded in rubber matrix. The dimensional analysis is applied to derive a general equation of J-integral, and then it is assumed that the equation of J-integral can be separated into the deformation and geometry functions, the validity of which is proved by using separation parameter. The J-integral is expressed in a multiplicative form in which the geometry <b>calibration</b> <b>function</b> (or factor) is introduced in order to take into account the finite dimensions. The values of the J-integral for the rubber-cord composites with various crack and specimen radius are obtained by using finite element analysis (FEA), and these results are used for concretely determining the geometry <b>calibration</b> <b>function,</b> which, in this work, is expressed in a polynomial form of fourth order. The deformation <b>calibration</b> <b>function,</b> which is a constant for a linear elastic materials, characterizing the large deformable nonlinear effect in rubbery materials is obtained by comparing the equation of J-integral with the ones for the linear elastic deformation. As we approach the infinitesimal strain, the value of the deformation <b>calibration</b> <b>function</b> comes close to the result of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{to estimate}} in-bank river discharge exclusively from remotely sensed hydraulic data is developed. Water-surface width and maximum channel width measured from 26 aerial and digital orthophotos of 17 single channel rivers and 41 SAR images of three braided rivers were coupled with channel slope {{data obtained from}} topographic maps to estimate the discharge. The standard error of the discharge estimates were within a factor of 1. 5 – 2 (50 – 100 %) of the observed, with the mean estimate accuracy within 10 %. This level of accuracy was achieved using <b>calibration</b> <b>functions</b> developed from observed discharge. The <b>calibration</b> <b>functions</b> use reach specific geomorphic variables, the maximum channel width and the channel slope, to predict a correction factor. The <b>calibration</b> <b>functions</b> are related to channel type. Surface velocity and width information, obtained from a single C-band image obtained by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s (JPL’s) AirSAR was also used to estimate discharge for a reach of the Missouri River. Without using a <b>calibration</b> <b>function,</b> the estimate accuracy was C 72 % of the observed discharge, which is within the expected range of uncertainty for the method. However, using the observed velocity to calibrate the initial estimate improved the estimate accuracy to within C 10 % of the observed.

40|$|Soil {{moisture}} content and dry density of unbound granular pavement materials are important properties for compaction control that influence pavement performance under cyclic loading. Under these loading conditions, increasing {{moisture content}} can accelerate {{significant changes in}} density. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a method for measuring the moisture content and density of soils with rod probe sensors. This paper introduces new <b>calibration</b> <b>functions</b> for TDR measurements using these rod probe sensors embedded in the soil. TDR measurements were taken in the laboratory for a typical road base material at two basically different conditions: at constant moisture content with different dry densities and at constant dry density with different moisture contents. In this study, a relationship was developed between the voltage drop occurring for the passage of an electromagnetic wave through the soil and the bulk density. The permittivity of the soil sample obtained from the travel time of TDR signals was {{used to calculate the}} volumetric moisture content. Finally, the gravimetric moisture content was obtained from the volumetric moisture content and bulk density relationship. For the validation of the <b>calibration</b> <b>functions,</b> rod probe sensors were installed in a road to obtain in situ moisture content and density under field conditions. Laboratory results indicate that the <b>calibration</b> <b>functions</b> are independent of moisture and density, and the field test shows the applicability of the method.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} component of any accountability system for nuclear materials is a tank calibration equation that relates {{the height of}} liquid in a tank to its volume. Tank volume calibration equations are typically determined from pairs of height and volume measurements taken {{in a series of}} calibration runs. After raw calibration data are standardized to a fixed set of reference conditions, the calibration equation is typically fit by dividing the data into several segments [...] corresponding to regions in the tank [...] and independently fitting the data for each segment. The estimates obtained for individual segments must then be combined to obtain an estimate of the entire <b>calibration</b> <b>function.</b> This process is tedious and time-consuming. Moreover, uncertainty estimates may be misleading because it is difficult to properly model run-to-tun variability and between-segment correlation. In this paper, they describe a model whose parameters can be estimated simultaneously for all segments of the calibration data, thereby eliminating the need for segment-by-segment estimation. The essence of the proposed model is to define a suitable polynomial to fit to each segment and then extend its definition to the domain of the entire <b>calibration</b> <b>function,</b> so that it (the entire <b>calibration</b> <b>function)</b> can be expressed as the sum of these extended polynomials. The model provides defensible estimates of between-run variability and yields a proper treatment of between-segments correlations. A portable software package, called TANCS, has been developed to facilitate the acquisition, standardization, and analysis of tank calibration data. The TANCS package was used for the calculations in an example presented to illustrate the unified modeling approach described in this paper. With TANCS, a trial <b>calibration</b> <b>function</b> can be estimated and evaluated in a matter of minutes...|$|R

40|$|A new {{procedure}} {{for determining the}} <b>calibration</b> <b>function</b> able to relate retention and operative parameters to molecular weight of the species in Thermal Field Flow (ThFFF) under Thermal Field Programming (TFP) conditions is presented. The procedure involves determining the average values of retention parameters under TFP and determining a numerical function related to the temperature variations that occur during TFP. The calibration parameters are obtained by a procedure fitting the retention and operative parameters that hold true {{at the beginning of}} the TFP. The procedure is closely related to the one previously developed to calibrate the retention time axis under TFP ThFFF and, together, they constitute a full calibration procedure. Experimental validation was performed with reference to Polystyrene (PS) -decalin and PS-tetrahydrofurane (THF) systems. The <b>calibration</b> <b>functions</b> here obtained were compared to those derived by the classical procedure at constant thermal field ThFFF to obtain the <b>calibration</b> <b>function</b> at variable cold wall temperatures. Excellent agreement was found in all cases proving “universality” of the ThFFF calibration concept, i. e. it is independent of the particular system on which it was determined and can thus be extended to ThFFF operating under TFP. The new procedure is simpler than the classical one since it requires less precision in setting the instrumentation and can be obtained with a fewer experiments. The potential applications for the method are discussed...|$|R
