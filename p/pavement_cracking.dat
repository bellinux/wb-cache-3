40|$|Abstract. As {{a result}} of plain {{concrete}} <b>pavement</b> <b>cracking</b> phenomenon is more serious, leading to the late maintenance and repair costs are higher, resulting in the national great economic losses, it has taken many measures to alleviate the damage of pavement, of which {{the most widely used}} reinforced concrete. The use of reinforced concrete materials can effectively delay the <b>pavement</b> <b>cracking</b> phenomenon, but its cost is high. In this paper we consider the use of bamboo reinforcement in concrete pavement instead of steel, and compare the bending test of the two kids of board, the bamboo reinforced concrete board and a concrete board. The experiment indicated that, compared with ordinary concrete board, the ultimate strength of bamboo reinforced concrete plate has been grew 87. 5 %, and reinforced concrete plate has certain signs before failure, so the concrete reinforced with bamboo ribs can prolong the concrete crack time, but also greatly improve the concrete pavement flexural strength and crack resistance. Bamboo reinforcement applied in concrete pavement is entirely feasible, and it is good of the application development prospect about bamboo reinforcement...|$|E

The re‒construction of the city street pavement and base course were completed during a protracted drought period, and shortly after completion of the pavement section longitudinal cracks occurred predominantly along the curb line. The case history concluded that the drought conditions resulted in significant subgrade soil shrinkage. The shrinkage caused changes in soil suction with depth resulting in tensile stresses in the asphalt pavement and stabilized subbase that lead to the <b>pavement</b> <b>cracking.</b> A simple practical moisture/suction variation model with depth (Hamberg) was used in conjunction with the soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) to make predictions of the soil suction changes that are resulting in the <b>pavement</b> <b>cracking.</b> The paper documents the comparison of the Hamberg model used in the case history with the Mitchell and finite element (FEM) models.

The three-dimensional (3 D) <b>pavement</b> <b>crack</b> detection technique based on laser is a recent trend due to its ability of discriminating dark areas, which are not caused by pavement distress such as tire marks, oil spills and shadows. In the field of 3 D <b>pavement</b> <b>crack</b> detection, the most important thing is the accurate extraction of <b>cracks</b> in individual <b>pavement</b> profile without destroying pavement profile. So after analyzing the pavement profile signal characteristics and the changeability of <b>pavement</b> <b>crack</b> characteristics, a new method based on the sparse representation is developed to decompose pavement profile signal into a summation of the mainly <b>pavement</b> profile and <b>cracks.</b> Based on the characteristics of the pavement profile signal and crack, the mixed dictionary is constructed with an over-complete exponential function and an over-complete trapezoidal membership function, and the signal is separated by learning in this mixed dictionary with a matching pursuit algorithm.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the image-processing algorithm customized for high-speed, real-time inspection of <b>pavement</b> <b>cracking.</b> In the algorithm, a pavement image {{is divided into}} grid cells of 8 x 8 pixels, and each cell is classified as a non-crack or crack cell using the grayscale information of the border pixels. Whether a crack cell {{can be regarded as}} a basic element (or seed) depends on its contrast to the neighboring cells. A number of crack seeds can be called a crack cluster if they fall on a linear string. A crack cluster corresponds to a dark strip in the original image {{that may or may not}} be a section of a real crack. Additional conditions to verify a crack cluster include the requirements in the contrast, width, and length of the strip. If verified crack clusters are oriented in similar directions, they will be joined to become one crack. Because many operations are performed on crack seeds rather than on the original image, crack detection can be executed simultaneously when the frame grabber is forming a new image, which permits a real-time, online pavement survey. The trial test results show good repeatability and accuracy when multiple surveys were conducted in different driving conditions. 17.

If conducted in the field, safety and related liability of manual survey present challenges to highway agencies. Therefore automated processes for cracking analysis have been sought after in the past decades.

Cracking definitions in the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) and the Mechanistic-Empirical Design Guide (MEPDG) represent two efforts in defining cracking applications for pavement condition monitoring and prediction modelling of pavement condition in design respectively.

30|$|Crack {{evaluation}} {{is essential for}} effective classification of <b>pavement</b> <b>cracks.</b> Digital images of <b>pavement</b> <b>cracks</b> have been analyzed using techniques such as fuzzy set theory and neural networks. Bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD), a new image analysis method recently developed, can potentially be used for <b>pavement</b> <b>crack</b> evaluation. BEMD {{is an extension of}} the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which can decompose nonlinear and nonstationary signals into basis functions called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). IMFs are monocomponent functions that have well-defined instantaneous frequencies. EMD is a sifting process that is nonparametric and data driven; it does not depend on an a priori basis set. It is able to remove noise from signals without complicated convolution processes. BEMD decomposes an image into two-dimensional IMFs. The present paper explores <b>pavement</b> <b>crack</b> detection using BEMD together with the Sobel edge detector. A number of images are filtered with BEMD to remove noise, and the residual image analyzed with the Sobel edge detector for crack detection. The results are compared with results from the Canny edge detector, which uses a Gaussian filter for image smoothing before performing edge detection. The objective is to qualitatively explore how well BEMD is able to smooth an image for more effective edge detection with the Sobel method.|$|R

Temperature during the construction and curing temperature and humidity of continuously reinforced concrete pavement is of great influence on the crack occurrence. Cracks outside the tunnel occur more and are with concentrated distribution in the early stage. Crack distribution in the tunnel is more reasonable. After eight months including a winter, the crack number increased significantly outside, while the spacing was wider and the width was smaller in the tunnel.

40|$|Timely {{identification}} of undesirable <b>pavement</b> <b>crack</b> conditions {{has been a}} major task in pavement management. Up to date, myriads of pavement performance models have been developed for forecasting <b>pavement</b> <b>crack</b> condition with the traditional preferred techniques being the use of regression relationships developed from laboratory and/or field statistical data. However, it becomes difficult for regression techniques to predict the crack performance accurately and robustly {{in the presence of a}} variety of tributary factors, high nonlinearity, and uncertainty. With the advancement of modeling techniques, two innovative breeds of models, Artificial Neural Networks and Markov Chains, have drawn increasing attention from researchers for modeling complex phenomena like the <b>pavement</b> <b>crack</b> performance. In this study, two distinct models, a recurrent Markov chain, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were developed for modeling the performance of <b>pavement</b> <b>crack</b> condition with time. A logistic model was used to establish a dynamic relationship between transition probabilities associated with the <b>pavement</b> <b>crack</b> condition and the applicable tributary variables. The logistic model was then used conveniently to construct a recurrent Markov chain for use in predicting the crack performance of asphalt pavements in Florida. Florida pavement condition survey database were utilized to perform a case study of the proposed methodologies. For comparison purpose, a currently popular static Markov chain was also developed based on a homogeneous transition probability matrix that was derived from the crack index statistics of Florida pavement survey database. To evaluate the model performance, two comparisons were made; (1) between the recurrent Markov chain and the static Markov chain; and (2) between the recurrent Markov chain and the ANN. It is shown that the recurrent Markov chain outperforms both the static Markov chain and the ANN in terms of one-year forecasting accuracy. Therefore, with high uncertainty typically experienced in the pavement condition deterioration process, the probabilistic dynamic modeling approach as embodied in the recurrent Markov chain provides a more appropriate and applicable methodology for modeling the pavement deterioration process with respect to cracks...|$|R
