40|$|The Flaviviridae family {{comprises}} {{a number}} of human pathogens, which, although sharing structural and functional features, cause diseases with very different outcomes.

40|$|Abstract. The {{variety of}} human {{activities}} and needs {{gives rise to}} a <b>plurality</b> <b>of</b> language <b>functions,</b> among them communication. However, communication is so highly rated that for many this is not merely a function, but the key factor that defines the reality of language. This high rating of communication has important consequences. For example, the variety <b>of</b> <b>functions</b> tends to be reduced to forms of communication. On the other hand, it leaves language in an environment to function in anonymity and pure transparency, becoming a point of serious discussion only within academic linguistics. Among literary scholars, it is either ignored just as in the common usage or it is discussed under one theme or another of academic linguistics. Between these two extremes, however, lies a deep question as to what language is to literature. This is the question opened up in this paper; and it is postulated that an adequate account of the relation of language and literature may only be attempted within a theory of literature...|$|R
40|$|The Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type- 1 (HIV- 1) is the causative {{agent of}} the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Combination {{antiviral}} therapy {{has proven to be}} particularly effective at suppressing viral replication, yet complete eradication of the virus from an infected individual remains elusive. Recently, a new class of antiviral drugs targeting the viral integrase (IN) has been added to the HAART (high active antiretroviral therapy) regimen. This novel drug class exerts its inhibitory effect by targeting one aspect of the dual-staged integration reaction. In contrast to the other two viral targets of HAART, the reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR) enzymes, both of which have singular roles in viral replication, IN contributes a <b>plurality</b> <b>of</b> <b>functions</b> to the viral life cycle, thus potentiating the development for further therapeutic intervention.

The image-processing system should enable the simultaneous execution of a <b>plurality</b> <b>of</b> <b>functions.</b> Because dedicated hardware lacks flexibility, {{there is a growing}} interest in using off-the-shelf computer technology. Because memory bandwidth is a scarce parameter, we will focus on optimization methods for bandwidth reduction within multiprocessor systems at the chip level. We create a practical realistic model of required compute and memory bandwidth for a given set of image-processing functions. Similar modeling is applied for the available system resources. We concentrate in particular on X-ray image processing based on multi-resolution decomposition, noise reduction and image-enhancement techniques. We derive formulas for which we can optimize the mapping of the application onto processors, cache and memory for different configurations. The data-block granularity is matched to the memory hierarchy, so that caching will be optimized for low latency. More specifically, we exploit the locality of the signal-processing functions to streamline the memory communication. A substantial performance improvement is realized by a new memorycommunication model that incorporates the data dependencies of the image-processing functions. Results show a memory-bandwidth reduction in the order of 60 % and a latency reduction in the order of 30 - 60 % compared to straightforward implementation...|$|E
40|$|Punishment could have, and {{actually}} has, a <b>plurality</b> <b>of</b> <b>functions,</b> {{some of which}} usually prevail over others, according to different social, political and cultural settings. For {{more than thirty years}} now, American case law has been seeing a constant increase {{in the use of the}} so called “shame sanctions” as alternative measures to more traditional punishments, and especially to short-term custodial sanctions. This sanctions, which technically are shaped as conditions for probation or supervised release, may consist in an extremely diversified set of measures, but they share the common feature of conveying a clear and public stigmatization of the offender, while trying to induce in him/her a strong feeling of shame. The use of shame sanctions has been positively evaluated by some scholars, who have stressed their efficacy in enhancing the preventive and, even more so, expressive function of punishment; nonetheless, other scholars contest their use, stressing the lack of any empirical data regarding a real preventive effect, while in the same time criticizing the lack of proportionality and extreme potential cruelty of such measures, that could be compared to modern “stocks and pillory”. Reviewing these different positions, and comparing them to the different punishment theories formulated by scholars in civil law countries, this essay tries to assess the feasibility and legitimacy of an increased, and intentional, use of shame in criminal law and criminal policy, particularly with regard to white-collar and corporate crime. The conclusions underline the lack of legitimacy of any stigmatizing policy, while positively evaluating legislative measures which could foster forms of reintegrative shaming...|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{information}} is ubiquitous in the biological sciences. But what do biologists mean by the term ‘information’? Is there something substantive when biologists refer to informational based concepts or alternatively, {{is the concept of}} information simply a useful fiction without any substantive content? In this thesis, I examine the notion of information as it pertains to both molecular and developmental biology which are fields of biology that are sometimes included as forming part of the research program of experimental biology (Weber, 2005). One of the interesting aspects of the biological sciences is that many biological explanations are functional explanations. Philosophers of biology have argued about the legitimacy of functional explanations in biology and indeed whether there is an account of functions that is effectively able to account for the type of functional ascriptions in biology. In chapter two, I introduce the notion of genetic coding and I argue that there is a legitimate sense in which one can refer to a genetic code – furthermore, there are some circumstances in which genes literally code for the primary sequences of polypeptides (which form the primary structure of proteins). In chapter three, I propose a pluralistic account of functions and I maintain that experimental biologists do not exclusively appeal to one account of functions when ascribing functions to various biological structures and traits. Furthermore, I argue that there are circumstances in which biologists legitimately ascribe teleofunctions to various biological structures in experimental biology. In the thesis, I defend the view that there is a <b>plurality</b> <b>of</b> <b>functions</b> and also a plurality of informational based concepts. I argue that there are many circumstances in which a particular biological structure can be considered to instantiate multiple functions. Thus, I contend that the view that a particular biological structure (or trait) can be uniquely characterised in terms of its function is fundamentally problematic. This position is not, however, consistent with the view that there is a plurality of informational teleofunctions which is a position which I do not defend in this thesis. Although some philosophers of biology have regarded the functions debate as a debate concerning competing and incompatible accounts of functions, I instead argue that the two major rival accounts of functions are compatible. I present and defend a version of a teleosemantic account of genetic information in chapter four. I also claim that some scientific concepts are explanatorily useful without being literally true. In this thesis, I apply Arnon Levy’s fictionalist account of biological information to the case of genetic information in order to argue that the notion of genetic information is an explanatorily important but ultimately fictional scientific concept (Levy, 2011). One of the interesting implications of the fictionalist account is that some explanatorily useful concepts should not necessarily be eliminated from the biological sciences simply on the basis that they are not literally true. I claim that there are only a relatively few number of circumstances in which biologists can legitimately ascribe information to biological structures such as genes. Consequently, one of the fundamental aims of this thesis is to establish the conditions under which biologists can legitimately ascribe information to biological structures such as genes. In chapters three and four, I show that there are only likely to be a relatively few number of circumstances in which biologists can legitimately ascribe information to genes and other genetic elements. Hence, claims to the effect that a gene contains information should be treated with caution. In chapter five, I turn my attention to developmental biology and in particular, I examine Lewis Wolpert’s so called French flag model of development where I propose that positional information has an indispensable explanatory role {{in the case of the}} French flag model (Wolpert, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1996). As will be seen in chapter five, the French flag model forms a central explanatory thesis in contemporary developmental biology. I defend an account of information that has the potential to distinguish cases where biologists are legitimately entitled to ascribe information from cases where biologists are not entitled to ascribe information to biological structures such as genes. I defend a pluralistic account of functions that is applicable to experimental biology and a fictionalist account of teleosemantics and it is argued that there are many contexts in which references to informational based concepts operate as a useful, albeit ultimately fictional, explanatory fiction...|$|E

40|$|Described herein are {{improved}} {{methods for}} correcting cone beam computed tomography signals to reduce scatter contamination contained therein. Generally, the improved methods involve generating a <b>plurality</b> <b>of</b> two-dimensional projection {{images of a}} subject from a three-dimensional multi-detector computed tomography image of the subject. This is followed by subtracting the <b>plurality</b> <b>of</b> two-dimensional projection images from a <b>plurality</b> <b>of</b> two-dimensional cone beam projection images of the subject to produce a <b>plurality</b> <b>of</b> two-dimensional estimated error projections that comprise an estimated error in the <b>plurality</b> <b>of</b> two-dimensional cone beam projection images. The <b>plurality</b> <b>of</b> two-dimensional estimated error projection images are subtracted from the <b>plurality</b> <b>of</b> two-dimensional cone beam projection images to generate a <b>plurality</b> <b>of</b> two-dimensional corrected cone beam projection images. A three-dimensional corrected cone beam computed tomography image of the subject is then constructed from the <b>plurality</b> <b>of</b> two-dimensional corrected cone beam projection images.
