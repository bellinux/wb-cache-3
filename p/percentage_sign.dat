This paper presents an analysis of several traffic sign retroreflectivity maintenance methods using a sign asset management simulation based on inspection and sign data gathered in the field. The simulation evaluated 30 sign asset management scenarios in terms of annual maintenance cost per sign and percent of traffic signs not compliant with the proposed FHWA standard.

One hundred and ninety one consecutive prospective orthodontic female patients, divided into three age groups of 8, 14 and 18 years, were examined for TMD signs and symptoms and orthodontic treatment need (IOTN). The <b>percentages</b> of <b>signs</b> and symptoms found were 41 and 30 %, respectively. No significant association was found between IOTN and TMD signs and symptoms. The youngest age group reported significantly less headache and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) noise. Headache was significantly associated with all TMD symptoms and with tenderness to palpation. In conclusion, the results indicate that malocclusion could not be considered as a primary aetiologic factor for TMD within the age range studied. King Saud Universit...|$|R

Materials and methods: TMDs were recorded in a sample of 580 subjects (279 M, 301 F; mean age: 13. 4 y). For each subject a case history was compiled to evaluate the social and demographic parameters. An extraoral exam was effected to point out the face proportions, and an intraoral exam was performed to analyze dental occlusion, mandibular deviation during opening, presence of cross-bites, overjet and overbite. A functional exam was carried out to evaluate mandibular movements and to find joint sounds and myofascial pain. The sample was divided into 6 groups according to the: gender, age (ages 6 y- 11 y and 12 y- 16 y), Angle Dental Class, cross-bite, midline deviation and chewing side.

30|$|Tables  3,  4, and 5 {{show the}} number of times (in <b>percentages)</b> the <b>sign</b> of the next value changes based on the {{previous}} consecutive opposite signs. The rows show the previous direction of movement of the price up to time t. −  1  s represent a negative change in price (the price goes down), whereas +  1  s represent a positive change in price (the price goes up). Concurrently, two or more consecutive −  1  s or +  1  s represent two or more such consecutive moves in the same direction. The columns show the probability of the following direction of movement of the price for time (t+ 1). The results are very consistent for all three currency pairs and for all the timeframes checked. One or more than one consecutive −  1  s is consistently followed by +  1 with a higher percentage or probability in all timeframes. Similarly, one or more than one consecutive +  1  s is consistently followed by a −  1 with a higher percentage in all timeframes. Thus, the probability of return reversal is always higher than that of the trend continuing irrespective of the timeframe or the length of the trend checked. This also helps to explain why a large number of models learned with linear kernel SVR, even for more number of features and for varied timeframes, showed properties of return reversal.|$|R

In particular, we consider the class of hierarchical log-linear models. With sparse data, the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters may not exist (Agresti, 2002). Then, the natural focus is on low order interactions and we explore a multiple Lasso-based penalised like-lihood approach, ` (θ), in this context. Like [2], we use penalised likelihood to analyse simulated contingency tables [1] {{in order to produce}} simpler hierarchical models.

40|$|CIVINSSubmarine {{propulsion}} shafts {{have demonstrated}} acceptable reliability performance when inspected and refurbished {{at least every}} 6 years. Designers wish to extend the inspection interval to 12 years without sacrificing reliability. This interval is unprecedented, as no known submarine shafting system is currently operated with this inspection cycle, nor are any known commercial vessel shafts. Experience and improved design have eliminated many threats {{to the life of}} a submarine shaft, but inspections of existing shafts show a high <b>percentage</b> with <b>signs</b> of wetting, leaving designers with less-than-acceptable confidence to approve this longer inspection interval due to the possibility of corrosion fatigue failure. This thesis uses probabilistic models from literature for pitting and cracking of wetted shafts, along with Monte Carlo simulations, to predict results of shafts inspections. Each possible water ingress distribution is analyzed by simulating shafts under 6 years of exposure to the water ingress, pitting, and cracking models in order to estimate the effects of corrosion fatigue. A water ingress distribution that predicts inspection results closest to actual inspection results is identified. Some information about water ingress is inferred from this distribution. Next, using the same literature models, a water ingress distribution that predicts similar performance at 12 years is identified. It is shown that the time a shaft is in service prior to becoming wetted must increase substantially. Predicted failure rates are low, but they are still higher than acceptable. This thesis recommends that inspection procedures are updated to provide more robust information for future analyses, which would better identify the appropriate distributions and greatly reduce uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} done with the {{objective}} of determining the distance of movement between the maxillary and mandibular midline (DMM) and its relationship with the signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in canine-guided occlusion and to compare the obtained values between the right and left sides. Materials and Methods: One hundred females showing canine-guided occlusion and Angle's class I canine and molar relation were chosen for the study. The maxillary midline’s corresponding line was marked on the mandible with a marker pen in the patient's mouth, both during maximum intercuspation and at the edges of maxillary and mandibular canine contact. DMM was considered as the distance between the two lines (measured using a digital caliper). The <b>percentages</b> of <b>signs</b> and symptoms were compared using the chi-square test to determine the differences among the groups for the rates of TMD symp-toms, bruxism, joint sounds and unilateral chewing. Results: The mean value of the DMM for all subjects was found to be 3. 61 mm on the right side and 3. 64 mm on the left side. The values were subjected to a paired t-test, and the P value was statistically insignificant (P> 0. 05). Reported TMJ(temporo mandibular joints) clicking at the start was the only significant predictor (P< 0. 01) for TMD symptoms (pain in jaw), and bruxism was a marginally significant predictor for pain in the jaw (P= 0. 055).
