40|$|Like other {{academic}} libraries, the University of Kansas (KU) Libraries {{has been looking}} for efficiencies to save money. One method of savings adopted by KU Libraries is a demand-driven acquisition (DDA) model for purchasing monographs. KU librarians were reluctant to endorse this new model until they were given the option to base DDA <b>purchases</b> <b>on</b> price. Working with YBP, a new DDA model was developed to allow subject librarians at KU to choose a price limit for <b>purchases</b> <b>on</b> <b>approval.</b> Any monograph over the price limit was loaded into the library catalog as a DDA. During {{the development of the}} new DDA model, subject librarians in science and technology and the social sciences agreed that electronic books would be the preferred format for the approval plan and DDA model. In this paper, KU librarians will map out the processes they used to rewrite their approval plan profile to incorporate DDA and e-preferred acquisitions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{describe}} an assessment project of the monograph collection at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) Lied Library. The circulation statistics and in-house use of all monographs for the nine colleges at UNLV were assessed analyzing the last five years of data. The analysis included an assessment of the circulation statistics and in-house use of books <b>purchased</b> <b>on</b> an <b>approval</b> plan compared with books purchased by individual liaison librarians. The findings illustrated the fact that overall use of the monograph collection has declined over the past five years. The findings also showed that books <b>purchased</b> <b>on</b> an <b>approval</b> plan had slightly higher use than the books purchased by individual liaisons. The study shows that academic libraries need to monitor usage of the monograph collection to be certain that money is spent in the most efficient manner and that usage data can be helpful if there is a need to reduce budget allocations for monographs or if a reallocation of funds for monographs is necessary...|$|R
50|$|About Shuraih's {{appointment}} as a judge, it is related that Umar <b>purchased</b> a horse <b>on</b> <b>approval,</b> {{and gave it}} to somebody to try it. The horse got hurt in the ride, and Umar wanted to return it, but the owner refused to take it back. In the dispute that arose as a consequence, Shuraih was chosen as the arbitrator. He gave the verdict that if the horse was ridden with the permission of the owner it could be returned; otherwise not. Umar said that that was the right decision and at once appointed Shuraih as the Qadi of Kufa.|$|R
40|$|Proving {{the value}} of library {{collections}} {{has always been a}} concern of collection development librarians. Librarians have devised creative methods of gathering evidence to demonstrate to university administrations the essential role that libraries play in research productivity. In an attempt to demonstrate {{the value of}} library collections, the authors from the University of Kansas (KU) Libraries conducted a citation analysis study utilizing KU science faculty publications. Using a random sampling of faculty from the departments of Physics, Environmental and Evolutionary Biology, and Geology, the authors developed lists of the citations in these faculty publications and checked to determine if KU Libraries provides access to these cited materials. In addition, a random sampling of the citations from the faculty publications was also examined to determine if the citations could be accessed through aggregator full-text databases, electronic journal packages, or print journals and monographs. The authors also compared journal and monograph use and utilized the data collected as a method of justifying budget allocation practices. Finally, the monograph citations were analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the approval plan profile by identifying the ratio of books that were <b>purchased</b> <b>on</b> the <b>approval</b> plan compared to books that were selected by subject librarians. The authors will share their findings and discuss how they used the citation analysis to demonstrate the value of the library collections and inform collection development decisions...|$|R
40|$|Objective – This study {{analyzes}} sources {{cited by}} {{graduate students in}} philosophy at the University of Colorado Boulder (UCB) in 55 PhD dissertations and master’s theses submitted between 2005 and 2010, to discover their language, age, format, discipline, {{whether or not they}} were held by the library, and how they were acquired. Results were compared to data previously collected about sources cited by philosophy faculty at UCB, in books published between 2004 and 2009, to identify how closely citation behaviors aligned between the two groups. Methods – Citations were counted in the PhD dissertations and master’s theses. Citations to monographs were searched against the local catalog to determine ownership and call number. Comparison numbers for faculty research were collected from a previous study. Results were grouped according to academic rank and analyzed by format, language, age, call number, ownership, and method of purchase. Results – Graduate students cited mostly books, though fewer than commonly found in other studies. Citations were almost entirely of English language sources. Master’s students cited slightly newer materials than doctoral students, who in turn cited newer materials than faculty. The library owned most cited books, and most of those were <b>purchased</b> <b>on</b> an <b>approval</b> plan. Doctoral students most frequently cited resources outside the discipline of philosophy, in contrast to master’s students and faculty. Conclusions – The citation behavior of graduate students in philosophy largely, but not entirely, mirrors that of the faculty. Further study of citation behavior in humanities disciplines would be useful. Understanding the behavior of philosophers can help philosophy librarians make informed choices about how to spend library funds...|$|R
