5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> the machined surface is always the inverse of the <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E

40|$|Collocated <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> the Reynolds {{stress tensor}} and eddy {{covariance}} fluxes are obtained to derive vertical <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> turbulent momentum and sediment diffusivity in a tidal river, using coupled acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs). Shear and normal stresses are obtained {{by combining the}} variances in radial velocities measured by the ADCP beams. The covariances between radial velocities and calibrated acoustic backscatter allow {{the determination of the}} three Cartesian components of the turbulent flux of suspended sediment. The main advantage of this new approach is that flow velocity and sediment concentration measurements are exactly collocated, and allowing for profiling over longer ranges, in comparison to existing techniques. Results show that vertical <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> the inverse turbulent Prandtl-Schmidt number are coherent with corresponding <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> the sediment diffusivity, rather than with <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> the eddy viscosity...|$|R

Of these samples, 174 isolates simultaneously grew on L&# 246;wenstein-Jensen (LJ) and Stonebrink (SB) -containing media and presented phenotypic and molecular <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> Mycobacterium tuberculosis, whereas 12 had molecular <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> M. tuberculosis based on the DNA analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin wax-embedded tissue samples (paraffin blocks).

One patient provided a bronchial lavage isolate, which simultaneously grew on LJ and SB media and presented phenotypic and molecular <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> M. tuberculosis, but had molecular <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> M. bovis from paraffin block DNA analysis, and one sample had molecular <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> M. tuberculosis and M. bovis identified from two distinct paraffin blocks.

40|$|The outer {{membrane}} protein (OMP) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> 30 untypeable isolates of PusteureZZu huemolyticu were examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and {{compared with the}} <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> typeable isolates. The phylogenetic relationships of 28 isolates representing each of the serotypes of P. haemolyticu and PusteureZlu trehulosi, as well as untypeable isolates of P. huemolytica, were determined by comparing 16 s rRNA sequences. The analysis of the OMP and LPS <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> the untypeable isolates revealed five groups, which were designated untypeable groups 1 (UG 1) through UG 5. The UG 1 and UG 2 isolates had OMP and LPS profiles identical to the <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> certain serotype A 1 and A 2 isolates, respectively. Furthermore, UGl isolates originating from cattle and sheep could be clearly differentiated on the basis <b>of</b> their OMP <b>profiles.</b> The OMP and LPS <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> UG 3 isolates were similar in appearance to the <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> serotype All isolates, suggesting that these two groups are closely related. The OMP <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> UG 4 and UG 5 isolates were unique and different from the OMP <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> the UG 1 through UG 3 isolates. A comparison of 16 s rRNA sequences revealed that typeable isolates of P. huemolyticu could be divided into the following three groups: (i) serotype Al, A 5 through A 9, A 12 through A 14, and A 16 isolates, (ii) serotype A 2 isolates, and (iii) serotype All isolates.
