It is concluded that although cognisance has indeed to be taken of the needs and demands of postmodern man (in the shape of learners, for instance), <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>authority</b> <b>in</b> educational context should strive to apply principles based on a Biblically-based/reformational view of man, society, authority, freedom, responsibility, accountability, order and discipline...|$|R
