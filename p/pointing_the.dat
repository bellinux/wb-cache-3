5|$|In a flashforward to the prison, {{the ending}} is {{determined}} based on Reza's actions to Hossein throughout the game: if Reza was unpleasant to Hossein, Hajj frees the latter, who begins to choke Reza and demands Bibi's location; if Reza was favorable to Hossein, Hajj shoots and kills the latter, before <b>pointing</b> <b>the</b> gun to Reza's head and demanding Bibi's location.|$|E
5|$|Wagner's later musical style {{introduced}} {{new ideas}} in harmony, melodic process (leitmotif) and operatic structure. Notably from Tristan und Isolde onwards, he explored {{the limits of}} the traditional tonal system, which gave keys and chords their identity, <b>pointing</b> <b>the</b> way to atonality in the 20th century. Some music historians date the beginning of modern classical music to the first notes of Tristan, which include the so-called Tristan chord.|$|E
5|$|After having {{positioned}} {{to perform a}} visual inspection, the robot performs an acquisition with a pan-tilt-zoom camera. Several steps take place: <b>pointing</b> <b>the</b> camera, sensing the element to be inspected, if needed repointing and zooming with the camera, image acquisition and inspection. Image analysis is used on doors {{to determine whether they}} are open or closed; on {{the presence or absence of}} protection for certain equipment; the state of turbofan blades or the wear of landing gear tires.|$|E
5000|$|Each couple {{performed}} two dances. The {{first was}} scored normally. The second, the marathon dance, was different. All nine couples performed a Mambo {{at the same}} time. One by one, the judges asked a couple to leave the floor. The first couple to leave received 2 <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> second couple got 3 <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> third couple got 4 <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> fourth couple got 5 <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> fifth couple got 6 <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> sixth couple got 7 <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> seventh couple got 8 <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> eighth couple got 9 <b>points,</b> and <b>the</b> last remaining couple got 10 points. Therefore, a team could have earned a maximum of 40 points in Week 6.|$|R

5|$|The second {{classification}} was <b>the</b> <b>points</b> classification. Riders {{were awarded}} points for finishing {{in the top}} fifteen places on each stage and {{in the top three}} at each intermediate sprint. The first rider at each stage finish was awarded 25 <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> second 20 <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> third 16 <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> fourth 14 <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> fifth 12 <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> sixth 10 <b>points,</b> down to 1 <b>point</b> for <b>the</b> rider in fifteenth. At the intermediate sprints, the first three riders won 4, 2 and 1 <b>points</b> respectively. <b>The</b> rider with <b>the</b> most <b>points</b> won <b>the</b> classification and wore a green jersey.|$|R
5|$|Males exhibit {{pronounced}} marking behaviourterritories, termite mounds, trees, common tracks, and junctions {{are marked}} by urine, faeces, and claw scratches. Males marking their territory by urination stand less than a metre away from a tree or rock surface with the tail raised, <b>pointing</b> <b>the</b> penis either horizontally backward or 60° upward. Territorial clashes can take place between two coalitions, or coalitions and solitary males; fights, however, are rarely gruesome. Another major reason for fights is to acquire dominance in the breeding season. These can even involve cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|Malick's {{unconventional}} filming techniques included shooting {{part of a}} scene {{during a}} bright, sunny morning only to finish it weeks later at sunset. He {{made a habit of}} <b>pointing</b> <b>the</b> camera away during an action sequence and focus on a parrot, a tree branch or other fauna. Malick's reputation and working methods commanded great respect among the actors, with both Woody Harrelson and John Savage staying on for an extra month after they finished all of their scenes just to watch him at work.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} portion of the game is spent sailing between islands on Link's boat, the King of Red Lions. The boat's sail is driven by wind that blows across the game world in one of eight directions; a tailwind behind the boat will give it top speed, while sailing against the wind is difficult. The Great Sea features different enemies and obstacles than appear on land. Some items serve new purposes on the King of Red Lions; for instance, the grappling hook serves as a crane for recovering sunken treasure. Link explores the sea {{with the help of a}} sea chart, which can be updated with information on each square and island. Through the game, Link acquires additional charts <b>pointing</b> <b>the</b> way to treasure chests and significant locations. On land, dungeons feature similar maps.|$|E

5|$|In Star Wars: Jedi Arena, two Jedi Knights, one {{blue and}} one red, {{face each other}} during lightsaber training. Player one is blue; the red Jedi is either a human- or {{computer-controlled}} opponent. The player controls his or her lightsaber with the paddle controller, defending oneself from the laser blasts coming from the Seeker ball, fired by the opponent. The Seeker will regularly turn wild and fire laser blasts randomly. The objective {{of the game is}} to fire laser blasts from the Seeker at the opponent's shield and finally directly at the opponent by aiming in the direction that the lightsaber is <b>pointing.</b> <b>The</b> game has four difficulty levels, changing the Seeker's speed; on the highest level, the Seeker is invisible. The game ends when one player has received three direct hits, and the winner becomes a Jedi Master.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the night shark is viviparous: once the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Adult females have a single functional ovary (on the right) and two functional uteruses, which are divided into separate compartments for each embryo. Within the uterus the embryos lie lengthwise with their heads <b>pointing</b> <b>the</b> same direction as their mother. Most information known about the night shark's life history comes from the subpopulation off northeastern Brazil, and may not hold true {{in other parts of}} the species range. Northeastern Brazilian sharks mate throughout the summer, with the males biting at the female's body and fins as a prelude to copulation.|$|E
5|$|Major {{memorial}} themes, such as {{victory and}} death all had their symbols. Many Canadian and British soldiers are shown raising a hat or a rifle, {{a sign of}} victory first introduced into Boer War memorials. The Greek goddess Nike herself frequently appears on civic memorials, particularly in Britain and Canada, personifying victory, often <b>pointing</b> <b>the</b> way to soldiers: the image is far less, common, however, on more sombre memorials in battlefields and graveyards. Personifications of Death rarely feature on these memorials, however, probably because the emphasis is typically on the self-sacrifice of the soldiers involved, rather than their being taken or claimed by Death. Death is more typically presented through images of widows, orphans and elderly parents on memorials, all popular inter-war allegorical forms for death and grieving. Figures of women often represented peace, civilisation or wider humanity.|$|E

5|$|On 21 February 1940, John Randall and Harry Boot first ran their cavity {{magnetron}} at 10cm (3GHz). In April, GEC was told {{of their work}} {{and asked if they}} could improve the design. They introduced new sealing methods and an improved cathode, delivering two examples capable of generating 10kW of power at 10cm, an order of magnitude better than any existing microwave device. At this wavelength, a half-dipole antenna was only a few centimetres long, and allowed Lovell's team to begin looking at parabolic reflectors, producing a beam only 5 degrees wide. This had the enormous advantage of avoiding ground reflections by simply not <b>pointing</b> <b>the</b> antenna downwards, allowing the fighter to see any target at its altitude or above it.|$|E
5|$|On the 36th lap, Glock's right-rear {{suspension}} failed {{coming out}} of the final corner. He spun through 180 degrees before hitting the pit wall with a strong rearward impact, with debris flying across the track. The car, <b>pointing</b> <b>the</b> wrong way, rolled to a stop on the grass. A dazed Glock extracted himself before being treated at the medical centre. The safety car was deployed after the accident. When the pit lane opened on lap38, most drivers headed in, including all of the leaders except Hamilton. McLaren believed that Hamilton had enough fuel to stay out, the plan being for him to then rapidly pull away from his heavily-fuelled rivals, after the safety car went in. Hamilton needed to build up enough of a lead to rejoin still in first position, following his final pit stop. This would prove to be very risky, as Massa rejoined in fourth position, fuelled to the finish.|$|E
