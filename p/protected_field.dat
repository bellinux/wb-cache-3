40|$|It {{is shown}} here that a Kagomé magnet, with Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya {{interactions}} causes non trivial topological and chiral magnetic properties. Chirality [...] -that is, {{left or right}} handedness [...] -is a very important concept in {{a broad range of}} scientific areas, and particularly, in condensed matter physics. Inversion symmetry breaking relates chirality with skyrmions, that are <b>protected</b> <b>field</b> configurations with particle-like and topological properties. Here, the reported numerical simulations and theoretical considerations reveal that the magnetic excitations of the Kagomé magnet can both be of regular bulk magnon character, as well as, having a non-trivial topological nature. We also find that under special circumstances, skyrmions emerge as excitations, having stability even at room temperature. Chiral magnonic edge states of a Kagomé magnet offer, in addition, a promising way to create, control and manipulate skyrmions. This has potential for applications in spintronics, magnonics and skyrmionics, i. e., for information storage or as logic devices based on the transportation and control of these particles. Collisions between these particle-like excitations are found to be elastic in the skyrmion-skyrmion channel, albeit without mass-conservation for an individual skyrmion. Skyrmion-antiskyrmion collisions are found to be more complex, where annihilation and creation of these objects have a distinct non-local nature. Comment: 15 pages, 10 figure...|$|E

40|$|This paper won the 2009 Friends of Fondren Library Research Award for {{graduate}} research. This paper questions {{the applicability of}} current legal standards of copyright to architectural works. Copyright law, as currently written, {{does not address the}} unique needs and design practices common to the field of architecture. For example, in architecture, the appropriation of existing design strategies in new built works is common, and should not be seen as a copyright infringement. Secondly, architectural works integrate aesthetics and utility in ways that are often difficult to separate, therein complicating the legal distinction between patents (intended for utilitarian objects) and copyrights (intended for artistic productions). Furthermore, architectural works are not usually meant to be mass-produced and are difficult to copy, thus bringing into question the need to regulate their reproduction. The desire to create connections with the surrounding context of a built work is a fourth argument against the copyrighting of architectural works. This paper problematizes architecture’s position as a copyright <b>protected</b> <b>field,</b> synthesizing information from intellectual property law, cultural theory, economics, and architecture, using the works of prolific architect Rem Koolhaas as key examples.

Results from the three sites indice that varied among sites and field surfaces and resulted in the consequent variations in potential wind erosion values are soil erodibility(I'), field length(L') and vegetation cover index(V). Results showed that the removal of crop residues from those sandy soils surfaces after harvest expose field surfaces to large losses of surface soils by wind erosion. On those surfaces the potential wind erosion of bare surface is 54 times more than that of the fallow surface. We recommend that crop residues should be left on fields after harvest to protect those sandy soils from wind erosion.

O presente trabalho teve por objetivo determinar um modelo matemático adequado para estimativa das áreas do folíolo e da folha do morangueiro. O experimento foi conduzido em Atibaia, SP, com a cv. Campinas (IAC- 2712), na safra de 1995, em condições de cultivo protegido e em campo aberto, ao lado de um plantio comercial. A amostragem, não destrutiva, constou de 25 folhas funcionais, expandidas e saudáveis, de diferentes idades e tamanhos, de 25 plantas ao acaso, em cada um dos ambientes. As áreas foram estimadas pelas medidas de largura (L) e de comprimento (C) dos folíolos, discriminando-se a posição ocupada pelos mesmos na folha trifoliada. Os resultados obtidos foram ajustados pelo modelo linear. A média da largura e do comprimento dos folíolos apresentou melhor capacidade de predição da área dos mesmos, quando comparada a utilização individualizada dessas medidas. O uso dos três folíolos apresentou melhor capacidade de predição da área foliar do que o uso exclusivo do folíolo central.

The leaflet width and length mean was concluded as the best way of predicting area compared to single measurements.

40|$|Introduction Blackbirds in the {{northern}} Great Plains aggregate in large flocks that feed on ripening crops, especially sunflower. Damage to the sunflower crop begins when the achenes reach the “milk” stage, which is in mid-August to late August. Direct economic losses from bird damage to sunflower probably exceed $ 5 million, annually (Peer et al., 2003). Growers incur additional costs trying to protect their crop from blackbirds. Growers can use several techniques singly and in combination to defend crops, including firearms, propane cannons, pyrotechnics, and fragmentation of dense cattails (Typha spp.). Except for cattail management with aerially applied glyphosate, most methods are time consuming, costly, and produce inconsistent results, particularly when used on large fields with many birds (Linz et al., 2011). Aerially applied feeding repellents may help protect sunflower in large fields, especially if used with other methods in an Integrated Pest Management Program (Linz et al., 2011). However, sunflower producers and USDA researchers have both reported inconsistent results with the only two repellents registered for use on ripening sunflower, Birdshield® and Flock Buster® (Linz et al. 2011). Results from cage tests on blackbirds have indicated that chemical repellents can be very effective. A particularly promising candidate is 9, 10 anthraquinone (Avery and Cummings, 2003). The anthraquinone (AQ) compound is classified as a biopesticide. AQ is naturally occurring {{and can be found}} in animals, plants, and bacteria. These organisms use AQ for chemical defense against predation, parasitism, and other types of attacks (e. g., herbivory). It has been tested and found to be an effective seed treatment for repelling granivorous birds from newly planted fields of canola, rice, corn, and sunflower (Avery and Cummings, 2003; Werner et al., 2011). The patent holder, Arkion™ Life Sciences LLC (551 Mews Drive Suite J., New Castle, Delaware, 19720, USA), has recently applied for a full national registration (EPA FIFRA Section 3) to use AQ repellent on corn seeds. Several studies using caged blackbirds have consistently shown that feeding rates are reduced by ≥ 80 % with AQ treatments, especially with sunflower. Werner et al. (2011) reported that AQ repelled COGR and RWBL confined within enclosures in fields of standing sunflower. Results from field trials in ripening rice were, however, equivocal (Avery and Cummings, 2003). For example, AQ <b>protected</b> <b>field</b> plots of ripening rice in Louisiana for 7 days following aerial application, but similar tests on wild rice in California yielded no treatment effect. The birds have to learn that AQ cause gastric distress by eating it, and its lack of effectiveness in wild rice was attributed to an influx of new, AQ-naive blackbirds at the study site. Of course, it is not unusual during the process of field-testing to have some inconclusive field trials. Thus, we remain committed to our immediate goal of expanding research on AQ to protect ripening fields of sunflower. This product could represent a major advance in blackbird damage management if repellency can be maintained at field application rates, with the caveat that residue levels at harvest meet the yet to be proposed food tolerance guidelines. We are now at the phase of testing that requires us to develop effective techniques for aerial and ground applications of a 9, 10 -anthraquinone product (Avipel®, Arkion™ Life Sciences; New Castle, DE) ...|$|E
