40|$|This paper {{presents}} a visual color image quality metric assessment with full reference image. The metric is highly based on human visual system properties {{in order to}} get the best correspondence with human judgements. Contrary to some others objective criteria, it doesn’t use any a priori knowledge on the type of introduced degradations. So the main interest of the metric is on its ability to produce robust results independently of the distortions. The metric can be decomposed into two steps. The first one projects each images, the reference one and the distorted one, in a perceptual space. The second step achieves the <b>pooling</b> <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> between perceptual representation of two images {{in order to get}} a score for the overall quality. Since we have shown that these two steps have equivalent importance regarding metric performance, we have particularly paid attention in correct balancing when designing the two steps. Especially, for the second one, that is generally limited to poor consideration in literature, we have developed some new original approaches. We compare results of the metric with human judgments on images distorted with different compression schemes. High performances are obtained leading to assure that the metric is robust, so this approach constitutes an alternative useful tool to PSNR for image quality assessment...|$|E

40|$|Are {{election}} polling misses {{becoming more}} prevalent? Are they more likely in some contexts than others? In this paper we undertake an over-time and cross-national assessment <b>of</b> prediction <b>errors</b> in pre-election polls. Our analysis draws {{on more than}} 26, 000 polls from 338 elections in 45 countries over the period between 1942 and 2013, as well as data on more recent elections from 2014 to 2016. We proceed in the following way. First, building on previous studies, we demonstrate how poll errors evolve in a structured way over the election timeline. Second, we then focus on errors in polls in the final week of the campaign to examine poll performance across election years. Third, we use the historical performance of polls to benchmark recent polling “misses” in the UK, US and elsewhere. Fourth, we undertake a <b>pooled</b> analysis <b>of</b> polling <b>errors</b> – controlling {{for a number of}} institutional and party features – which enables us to test whether poll errors have increased or decreased over time. We find that, contrary to conventional wisdom, recent performance of polls has not been outside the ordinary. The performance of polls does vary across political contexts, however, in understandable ways...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With EMU came a <b>pooling</b> <b>of</b> {{seignorage}} prots {{and losses}} and Germany {{may have to}} make (transfer) payments into the common seignorage pool. Germany also lost its competitive advantage on the international market for monetary base. This alone causes losses of seignorage prots. Losses from seignorage pooling may come on top. It is conceivable that the loss in competitive advantage may be so strong that Germany will eventually receive payments from the seignorage pool while suering from a net loss in seignorage prots. Sinn and Feist see German losses as arising exclusively from the <b>pooling</b> <b>of</b> seignorage prots (<b>pooling</b> no losses!"). In spite of confusing payments into the pool with seignorage losses and some additional errors, these authors manage to arrive, by a suitable compensation <b>of</b> <b>errors,</b> at a numerical loss gure that covers both sources of losses. Here, {{the quality of the}} Euro is important. The empirical evidence since the start of EMU supports our critique. A proof <b>of</b> <b>error</b> compensation is given in the appendix. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPopulation genomic approaches, {{which take}} {{advantages}} of high-throughput genotyping, are powerful yet costly methods to scan for selective sweeps. DNA-pooling strategies {{have been widely}} used for association studies because it is a cost-effective alternative to large-scale individual genotyping. Here, we performed an SNP-MaP (single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays and pooling) analysis using samples from Eurasia to evaluate the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>pooling</b> strategy in genome-wide scans for selection. By conducting simulations of allelotype data, we first demonstrated that the boxplot with average heterozygosity (HET) is a promising method to detect strong selective sweeps with a moderate level <b>of</b> <b>pooling</b> <b>error.</b> Based on this, we used a sliding window analysis of HET to detect the large contiguous regions (LCRs) putatively under selective sweeps from Eurasia datasets. This survey identified 63 LCRs in a European population. These signals were further supported by the integrated haplotype score (iHS) test using HapMap II data. We also confirmed the European-specific signatures of positive selection from several previously identified genes (KEL, TRPV 5, TRPV 6, EPHB 6). In summary, our results not only revealed the high credibility of SNP-MaP strategy in scanning for selective sweeps, but also provided an insight into the population differentiation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Maximum {{likelihood}} {{estimates of}} haplotype frequencies {{can be obtained}} from pooled DNA using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Through simulation, we investigate the effect <b>of</b> genotyping <b>error</b> on the accuracy of haplotype frequency estimates obtained using this algorithm. We explore model parameters including allele frequency, inter-marker linkage disequilibrium (LD), genotyping error rate, and pool size. Results <b>Pool</b> sizes <b>of</b> 2, 5, and 10 individuals achieved comparable levels of accuracy in the estimation procedure. Common marker allele frequencies and no inter-marker LD result in less accurate estimates. This pattern is observed regardless of the amount <b>of</b> genotyping <b>error</b> simulated. Conclusion Genotyping error slightly decreases the accuracy of haplotype frequency estimates. However, the EM algorithm performs well even in the presence <b>of</b> genotyping <b>error.</b> Overall, <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> 2, 5, and 10 individuals yield similar accuracy of the haplotype frequency estimates, while reducing costs due to genotyping. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPooling {{designs are}} {{standard}} experimental tools in many biotechnical applications. It is well-known that all famous pooling designs are constructed from mathematical structures by the “containment matrix” method. In particular, Macula’s designs (resp. Ngo and Du’s designs) are constructed {{by means of}} the containment relation of subsets (resp. subspaces) in a finite set (resp. vector space). In [J. Guo, K. Wang, A construction <b>of</b> <b>pooling</b> designs with high degree <b>of</b> <b>error</b> correction, J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 118 (2011) 2056 – 2058], we generalized Macula’s designs and obtained a family <b>of</b> <b>pooling</b> designs with higher degree <b>of</b> <b>error</b> correction. In this paper we consider, as a generalization of Ngo and Du’s designs, q-analogue of the above designs, and obtain a family <b>of</b> <b>pooling</b> designs with surprisingly high degree <b>of</b> <b>error</b> correction.

40|$|An {{experiment}} or test measuring response {{choice and}} response time generates a large <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> correct and <b>error</b> responses. These indicators of mental processing {{are often more}} revealing when corrected for guessing. An example drawn from lexical decision making motivates the principles behind correcting proportions, response time moments, distributions and histograms, and response confidence when only a single stimulus category, such as words, is used. A complete set of parameter estimates is obtained by analyzing only responses to word stimuli; therefore, false alarms (such as responses to nonwords) are not a necessary component of a correction for guessing. Nearly everyone {{is familiar with the}} method of correcting dichotomous or serial recall tests for guessing (Lord & Novick, 1968; Sperling & Melchner, 1976). To many, it comes as a surprise that in a similar context mean response times, response time distributions, confidence, and other mea-sures of performance may also be "cor-rected. " Like any analysis of data, these cor-rections require that assumptions be met by careful attention to experimental conditions. But before elaborating on these conditions, assumptions, and methods of correction, let us examine a rather typical case. A Numerical Example: Lexical Decision Making Reports that lexical decision times and correct response probabilities covary suggest that an experiment be conducted to deter-mine the basis for this often discovered find-ing.

40|$|The {{exponential}} growth of DNA sequencing technologies and concomitant advances in bioinformatics methods are revolutionizing {{our understanding of}} diverse microbial communities (Riesenfeld et al., 2004; Tyson et al., 2004; Hugenholtz and Tyson, 2008; Tringe and Hugenholtz, 2008; Caporaso et al., 2010). Large-scale microbial metagenomics studies have particularly exciting applications {{in the arena of}} human health, laying the foundation for the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). In the context of the HMP and related efforts, care has been taken to understand the impact of amplification biases or sequencing errors.
