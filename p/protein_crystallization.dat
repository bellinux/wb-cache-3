40|$|Two {{different}} <b>protein</b> <b>crystallizations,</b> namely,the free Fab {{fragment of}} the Je 142 monoclonal antibody and the complex of Fab fragment/HPr with antigen, were performed aboard the Discovery Space Shuttle flights and the Mir space station, respectively.

5|$|An {{example of}} a low-maintenance {{experiment}} was the protein crystal growth experiment, which had also been flown on previous shuttle missions. The goal was to produce better <b>protein</b> <b>crystallizations</b> than those produced on the Earth, and hence allowing for a more accurate model of protein structures. Of the 23 proteins and viruses attempted during Expedition 1, only four resulted in successful crystallizations, which was a lower success rate than predicted. Of those successful was the low-calorie sweetener Thaumatin, whose crystals diffracted at a higher resolution than Earth-grown crystal, {{which resulted in a}} more accurate protein structure model.|$|R
40|$|Direct {{methods of}} crystal {{structure}} solution are greatly facilitated in centrosymmetric space groups where {{the complexity of}} the phase-problem is reduced. For most peptides and <b>proteins,</b> <b>crystallization</b> in a centrosymmetric arrangement is precluded by an intrinsic dissymmetry due to the constituent chiral amino acid residues. The synthetic accessibility of peptide sequences containing amino acids of either chirality offers the possibility for co crystallization of racemic crystals. We report here the first use of such an approach for the de novo structure determination of a medium-sized molecule, trichogin A IV, which is a constituent of a fungal lipopeptaibol mixture possessing membrane-modifying properties of biological interest...|$|R

40|$|Strategies {{for growing}} protein {{crystals}} have {{for many years}} been essentially empirical, the protein, once purified to a certain homogeneity, being mixed with a selection of crystallization agents selected in {{a more or less}} trial-and-error fashion. Screening for the correct conditions has been made easier through automation and by the introduction of commercially available crystallization kits. Many parameters can be changed in these experiments, such as temperature, pH, and ionic strength, but perhaps the most important variable has been ignored, namely the <b>protein.</b> The <b>crystallization</b> properties of a protein vary greatly: some crystallize readily, whereas others have proven extremely difficult or even impossible to obtain in a crystalline state. The possibility of altering the intrinsic characteristics of a <b>protein</b> for <b>crystallization</b> has become a feasible strategy. Some historical perspectives and advances in this area will be reviewed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Crystals of transmembrane {{proteins}} may {{be grown}} from detergent solutions or in {{a matrix of}} membranous lipid bilayers existing in a liquid crystalline state and forming a cubic phase (in cubo). While crystallization in micellar solutions appears analogous to that for soluble <b>proteins,</b> <b>crystallization</b> in lipidic matrices is poorly understood. As this method was shown to be applicable to several membrane proteins, under-standing its mechanism will facilitate a rational design of crystallization, minimizing the laborious screening {{of a large number}} of parameters. Using polarization microscopy and low-angle X-ray diffraction, experimental evidence is provided to support a mechanistic model for the in cubo crystallization of bacteriorhodopsin in a lipid matrix. Membrane proteins are thought to reside in curved lipid bilayers, to diffuse into patches of lower curvature and to incorporate into lattices which associate to form highly ordered three-dimensional crystals. Critical testing of this model is necessary to generalize it to othe...|$|R
40|$|RNA {{molecules}} may be crystallized using {{variations of}} the methods developed for protein crystallography. As the technology has become available to syntheisize and purify RNA molecules in the quantities and with the quality that is required for crystallography, the field of RNA structure has exploded. The first consideration when crystallizing an RNA is the sequence, which may be varied in a rational way to enhance crystallizability or prevent formation of alternate structures. Once a sequence has been designed, the RNA may be synthesized chemically by solid-state synthesis, {{or it may be}} produced enzymatically using RNA polymerase and an appropriate DNA template. Purification of milligram quantities of RNA can be accomplished by HPLC or gel electrophoresis. As with <b>proteins,</b> <b>crystallization</b> of RNA is usually accomplished by vapor diffusion techniques. There are several considerations that are either unique to RNA crystallization or more important for RNA crystallization. Techniques for design, synthesis, purification, and crystallization of RNAs will be reviewed here...|$|R
40|$|An initial tranche {{of results}} from day-to-day {{use of a}} robotic system for setting up 100 nl-scale vapour-diffusion sitting-drop <b>protein</b> <b>crystallizations</b> has been surveyed. The {{database}} of over 50 unrelated samples represents a snapshot of projects currently at the stage of crystallization trials in Oxford research groups and as such encompasses {{a broad range of}} proteins. The results indicate that the nanolitre-scale methodology consistently identifies more crystallization conditions than traditional hand-pipetting-style methods; however, in a number of cases successful scale-up is then problematic. Crystals grown in the initial 100 nl-scale drops have in the majority of cases allowed useful characterization of x-ray diffraction, either in-house or at synchrotron beamlines. For a significant number of projects, full x-ray diffraction data sets have been collected to 3 Ã… resolution or better (either in-house or at the synchrotron) from crystals grown at the 100 nl scale. To date, five structures have been determined by molecular replacement directly from such data and a further three from scale-up of conditions established at the nanolitre scale...|$|R
