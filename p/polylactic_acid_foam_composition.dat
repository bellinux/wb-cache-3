40|$|In this study, {{microcellular}} <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> <b>foams</b> {{with various}} crystallinities, cell morphologies, and densities were prepared using CO 2 as the physical blowing agent. The evolution of crystallinity developments of {{four types of}} <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> samples during the saturation, foaming, and annealing processes was investigated. Crystallization of about 20 % was reached in <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> samples after CO 2 saturation, a high crystallinity of about 38. 2 % could be achieved for the <b>foamed</b> <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> that has the highest crystallization ability. <b>Poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> samples had low elongation at break of 3. 6 – 15. 1 %. After <b>foaming,</b> however, <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> <b>foam</b> presented {{a significant increase in}} the elongation at break up to 15. 1 times compared with that of the unfoamed counterpart. On the other hand, microcellular <b>foaming</b> endowed <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> <b>foams</b> with a maximum increase in specific tensile strength of 53. 1 %. The influences of crystallinity, foam density, and cell morphology on the tensile properties of <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> <b>foams</b> were investigated...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{flame-retardant}} <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> <b>foams</b> with satisfactory cell {{structures were}} prepared by microcellular foaming technology using phosphorus-containing flame retardant and graphene as the charring agent. The introduction of 5 - 30 wt% flame retardant increased the limited oxygen index value of <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> from 19. 0 to 26. 5 - 37. 8 % and simultaneously increased the <b>foam</b> expansion of <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> <b>foams</b> from 4. 4 to 5. 8 - 17. 5. In addition, all the prepared <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> /flame-retardant composites passed the UL- 94 V- 0 rating. The addition of 0. 5 wt% graphene increased the limited oxygen index value of <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> /flame-retardant composite with flame-retardant content of 15 wt% from 27. 9 to 29. 2 %, and more graphene additions improved the antidripping behavior of <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> composites. The possible mechanisms {{of the effects}} of the resultant cellular structure on the flame-retardant properties of <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> composites were also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of carbon}} dioxide for the {{production}} of <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>foams</b> has been increas-ingly studied recently. Much of the reported work has used supercritical carbon dioxide as a processing or foaming medium. However, a new foaming process which uses sub-critical liquid carbon dioxide conditions has been developed by the Biopolymer Network Limited. It is generally recognised that processing crystalline thermoplastics, including crystalline <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> polymers, into <b>foam</b> products using carbon dioxide is difficult due to lower solubility of liquid carbon dioxide in polymers and the increased polymer rigidity hindering the expansion of the polymer matrix. However, fundamental studies, and the associated knowledge of the foaming mechanisms at play, have allowed some new approaches to be developed within sub-critical carbon dioxide conditions which overcome many of these difficulties in <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>foams.</b> In this study, several commercially available grades of <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid,</b> ranging from crystalline to amorphous, were processed using carbon dioxide via the Biopolymer Network Limited process (sub-critical carbon dioxide). By adequately adjusting the process parameters, different crystalline grades were successfully foamed to low density. The resulting foams exhib-ited low to high levels of crystallinity, and consequently displayed varying thermal or physical properties. Cellular structures were observed by scanning electron microscopy. Crystallinity and thermal behaviour of the foamed samples were characterised using differential scanning calorimetry. Mechanical properties and dimensional stability were also investigated. It was shown that the selection of <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> feedstock, and its associated processing conditions, {{had a significant impact on}} the final quality and proper-ties of the foams...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this study, {{the outcome}} of {{operating}} conditions of extrusion assisted by supercritical CO 2 for the manufacture of <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> <b>foams</b> was investigated. It {{was found that the}} temperature before and inside the die was the most prominent parameter to tune the foam properties. Foam porosity as high as 96 % could be obtained (for die temperature between 109 and 112 degrees C), representing a total expansion exceeding 30. In this temperature range, low crystallinity (approximate to 6 %) was induced giving foams with high radial expansion i. e., large diameters and open porosity. At 112 degrees C, the CO 2 was able to greatly expand the foams, providing 73 % of its potential blowing effect. On the other hand, a low die temperature (below a die temperature of 107 degrees C) induces a significantly higher level of crystallinity resulting in foams with closed-porosity and a large longitudinal expansion due to higher strength of the polymer melt.

40|$|Finite element (FE) models {{accurately}} {{compute the}} mechanical response of bone and bone-like materials when the models include their detailed microstructure. In order to simulate non-linear behavior, which currently is only feasible {{at the expense}} of extremely high computational costs, coarser models can be used if the local morphology has been linked to the apparent mechanical behavior. The aim {{of this paper is to}} implement and validate such a constitutive law. This law is able to capture the non-linear structural behavior of bone-like materials through the use of fabric tensors. It also allows for irreversible strains using an elastoplastic material model incorporating hardening. These features are expressed in a constitutive law based on the anisotropic continuum damage theory coupled with isotropic elastoplasticity in a finite strains framework. This material model was implemented into Metafor, a non-linear FE software. The implementation was validated against experimental data of cylindrical samples subjected to compression. Three materials with bone-like microstructure were tested : aluminum foams of variable density (ERG, Oakland, CA), PLA (<b>polylactic</b> <b>acid)</b> <b>foam</b> (CERM, University of Liège) and cancellous bone tissue of a deer antler (Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Liège).

The aim of this work was to analyze the foamability of a biodegradable polymer, namely the <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid),</b> PLA. <b>Foam</b> injection molding was conducted by using a blowing agent under {{high pressure and temperature}} to produce parts having a cellular core and a compact solid skin (the so-called "structural foam"). The effect of a physical blowing agent (PBA) on density and morphology of foamed parts was characterized. A masterbatch of PLA and talc was prepared and adopted to obtain a compound containing 3 % of talc. On adding this percentage of talc to PLA it was possible to obtain foamed parts with a much better morphology. © 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Natural fibre {{reinforced}} <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> (PLA) <b>foams,</b> {{as potential}} green replacements for petroleum-based polymer foams, were investigated. Highly porous (ε > 95 %) microcellular PLA foams were manufactured by supercritical CO 2 assisted extrusion process. To overcome the inherently low melt strength of PLA, epoxy-functionalized chain extender was applied, while talc {{was added to}} improve its crystallization kinetics. The combined application of chain extender and talc effectively promoted the formation of uniform cell structures. The effect of cellulose and basalt fibre reinforcement on the foamability, morphology, structure and mechanical properties of the PLA foams were investigated as well. The addition of 5 wt% natural fibres promoted the cell nucleation, but caused non-uniform distribution of cell size due to the microholes induced by local fibre-matrix debonding. The compression strength of the manufactured basalt fibre reinforced PLA foams reached 40 kPa...|$|R
40|$|High {{expansion}} ratio, well-defined cell structure, and {{an excellent}} flame retardant characteristic are essential properties for broadening the applications of polymeric foam. In this study, by applying microcellular foaming technology using compressed CO, as the blowing agent, we are challenged to synthesize the desirable <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> (PLA) <b>foams</b> with phosphorus-containing flame retardant (FR) and starch as the natural charring agent. It was interesting {{to find that the}} introduction of 15 - 25 wt % FR increased the limiting oxygen index (LOI) of PLA foams from 18. 2 % to 24. 8 - 28. 4 % and simultaneously increased the foam expansion of PLA foams from 4. 4 to 7. 5 - 16. 0. The addition of starch with Content of 1 - 5 wt % further increased the LOT up to 30. 6 % and also endowed PLA/FR/St foams with improved antidripping properties.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} melt blend of <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> /liquid natural rubber with Cloisite C 30 B (C 30 B). The mechanical, thermal and {{morphological}} properties of <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> /liquid natural rubber and nanocomposites were investigated. Results indicate that Young’s modulus and flexural modulus increased {{with the addition}} of C 30 B to the <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> /liquid natural rubber blend. The elongation at break of <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> /liquid natural rubber increased significantly as compared to nanocomposite with 1 % of C 30 B, i. e. from 37. 3 % to 62. 4 %. Nevertheless, the elongation at break and impact strength decreased gradually when nanoclay content increased above 3 %, suggesting the addition of clay changed the strain response in the blend systems. The incorporation of nanoclay in the <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> /liquid natural rubber blends lowered the glass transition temperature values relative to <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid).</b> This behavior may be associated with more free volume available in the nanocomposite blend systems compared with pure <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid).</b> Morphological analyses by scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope revealed that different types of morphologies exist for <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> /liquid natural rubber and nanocomposites. This study indicates that <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> /liquid natural rubber-toughened nanocomposites with a higher modulus and that thermal stability could be produced...|$|R

Molecular {{structure of the}} four armed poly (lactic acid) was characterized via H- 1 -NMR and FTIR. It was confirmed that the star <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> was comprised with four-armed polymer chain and a tin porphyrin core.

Both star poly (lactic acid) film and linear poly (lactic acid) film were prepared using solution-casting method. Structural analysis via X-ray diffraction indicates that the star <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> films display the orthorhombic alpha-crystalline form, while linear <b>poly(lactic</b> <b>acid)</b> films display amorphous structure.

40|$|<b>Polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> {{filled with}} {{aragonite}} calcium carbonate composites was prepared using the open mould casting technique. The aragonites used were synthesized from Polymesoda bengalensis shell, locally known as lokan. The crystalline properties of polylactic acid/aragonite composites were measured using a differential scanning calorimeter, {{to identify the}} influence of aragonite particle content on the crystalline properties. The result has shown that crystalline onset temperature was obviously {{higher than those of}} unfilled <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> resin when the filler content (phi f) was 2 wt-%, then the value varied slightly. For crystalline temperature, the values were slightly varied between filled and unfilled <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> resin. The addition of aragonite also lowered the degree of crystallinity and enthalpy of fusion compared with unfilled <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> resin with the minimum value shown at 8 wt-% filler content (phi f). The result was also supported by X-ray diffraction where the highest <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> peak was shown in unfilled <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> resin and the lowest <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> peak was shown in 8 wt-% filler content (phi f). From the result, {{it can be seen that}} aragonite may play the role of a nucleating agent in the polylactide acid matrix resulting in the increase of onset temperature; however, limited movement of the <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> molecular chain and the decrease in the number of molecular chains play a more substantial role to the degree of crystallinity of the composite resulting in the drop of degree of crystallinity and enthalpy of fusion of the composite. The decrease in porosity of the <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> matrix with the inclusion of aragonite also contributed to the drop of degree of crystallinity and enthalpy of fusion of the composite...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only availableAn {{active area}} of {{research}} in the biomedical implant field is poly lactic <b>acid</b> (PLA). <b>Polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> is very interesting material for this field because it is a biocompatible and biodegradable material. One downside to using <b>Polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> PLA in biomedical implants is that it mechanical strength is much lower than that of its metal counterparts. However <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid's</b> many material attributes such as being biocompatibility and biodegradability make it a very promising and useful material if the mechanical properties were increased. In attempt to increase the bending strength of the <b>Polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> a Hydroxappatite filler was used. A mold was fabricated and samples were made using the heating press method. The samples were then test under three point bending to determines there bending strength using ASTM standard D 5023 - 07. Pol lactic acid (PLA) was tested ranging from zero percent Hydroxyappattie filler to five percent Hydroxyappatite filler. Pure <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> PLA was used as a base for comparisons. From these test to date the <b>polylactic</b> <b>acid</b> has shown a significant improvement in bending strength.
