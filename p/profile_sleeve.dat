[Location] The Alboran Sea is a {{partially}} landlocked, east-west oriented basin in the westernmost Mediterranean Sea. The studied {{sector of the}} open Spanish slope has been characterized by the occurrence of massmovements though the Pliocene and Quaternary. [Methods] The data used {{for the study of}} the Baraza landslide comprise multibeam bathymetry and seismic profiles, collected during different cruises (SAGAS, GC 90 - 1). A total of 10 single-channel seismic profiles have been studied, that include 8 very high resolution TOPAS profile, 1 high resolution Sparker profile, and 1 medium resolution airgun <b>profile</b> (<b>sleeve</b> guns, 120 c. i.). The Sparker profile belongs to the online IGME database (Geologic survey of Spain, [URL] and the multibeam bathymetry was transferred by the Spanish Oceanographic Institute-IEO.

The {{article is}} devoted to {{problems}} of hydrodynamic simulations of sliding friction in the liquid. The aim {{is to create an}} automated system for calculating the characteristics of sliding sleeves with arbitrary (smooth) profile. For this purpose developed a technique and algorithm for determining the carrying capacity of the bearing with arbitrary profile of the sliding sleeve, and developed recommendations for obtaining rational <b>profiles</b> of <b>sleeve</b> of bearing. On the basis of this methodology developed a system for calculating the characteristics of sliding bearing with the use of package of computer algebra Mathcad. Developed calculation system was used to search for variants of rational <b>profiling</b> of <b>sleeve</b> of sliding bearings. Were found variants of <b>profile</b> of sliding <b>sleeves</b> that provide an increase in carrying capacity compared with the supports that use traditional (round) <b>profile</b> of the <b>sleeve.</b> Designed system also allows quick comparison of the characteristics of sliding <b>sleeves</b> with different <b>profiles.</b> ?????? ????????? ????????? ????????????? ?????? ????????????????? ???? ?????????? ? ???????? ??????????? ??????. ????? ?????? ???????? ???????? ?????????????????? ??????? ??????? ????????????? ???? ?????????? ? ???????? ?????????????

The maid to the left faces the light, her brightly lit <b>profile</b> and <b>sleeve</b> creating a diagonal. Her opposite number creates a broader but less defined reflection of her attention, making a diagonal space between them, in which their charge stands protected.|$|R

Khonsari. 2 The {{authors have}} {{presented}} an inter-esting angular-compliant bearing design which, {{in comparison to}} conventional journal bearings, appears to yield some im-provement in the dynamic characteristics. The discusser won-ders if the author could comment on the followings: 1. What do the authors perceive {{to be the primary}} appli-cation of the angular-compliant bearings? Would such a design be suitable for use in aircraft engines where conventional hy-drodynamic bearings may pose a potential risk of failure? 2. It appears to the discusser that with the outer surface rotating—akin to a floating ring bearing—it may be possible to achieve a uniform temperature <b>profile</b> in the <b>sleeve,</b> thus reducing the bearing peak temperature. The implication of a superior thermal characteristic of such a bearing may be greater than its improvements in terms of the dynamic performance...|$|R

As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.Velázquez further emphasises the Infanta by his positioning and lighting of her maids of honour, whom he sets opposing one another: to left and right, before and behind the Infanta.

40|$|Both bolt {{profile shape}} and profile spacing (rib spacing) {{have been found}} to {{influence}} the bonding capacity of the grouted rock bolt. The bolt surface profile configuration has greater importance to rock bolt than the steel rebar used in civil engineering construction, because the rock bolt is subjected to greater dynamic loading than the steel rebar. The increased bonding capacity of bolts is important when supported ground is either heavily fractured, faulted or the supported ground is of soft formation, typically that of coal measure rocks. Past laboratory studies have identified the bolt profile spacing as of significant relevance to bolt resin rock bonding increase, however, no attempt has been made to determine the optimum spacing between the bolt profiles spacing. Accordingly, a series of laboratory tests were carried out on 22 core diameter bolts installed in cylindrical steel sleeve. The study was carried out by both push and pull testing. The push testing was carried out in 150 mm long sleeves while the pull testing was made in 115 mm long <b>sleeves.</b> <b>Profile</b> spacing tested include, 12. 5, 25. 0 mm, 37. 5 mm and 50 mm lengths. The profile spacing of 37. 5 mm wide was found to provide the optimum bearin...|$|R
