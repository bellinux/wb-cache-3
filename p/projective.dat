40|$|It is {{well-known}} that {{the category of}} comodules over a flat Hopf algebroid is abelian but typically fails to have enough <b>projectives,</b> and more generally, the category of graded comodules over a graded flat Hopf algebroid is abelian but typically fails to have enough <b>projectives.</b> In this short paper we prove that the category of connective graded comodules over a connective, graded, flat, finite-type Hopf algebroid has enough <b>projectives.</b> Applications in algebraic topology are given: the Hopf algebroids of stable co-operations in complex bordism, Brown-Peterson homology, and classical mod $p$ homology all have the property that their categories of connective graded comodules have enough <b>projectives...</b>|$|R

5|$|Art has {{sometimes}} stimulated {{the development of}} mathematics, as when Brunelleschi's theory of perspective in architecture and painting started a cycle of research {{that led to the}} work of Brook Taylor and Johann Heinrich Lambert on the mathematical foundations of perspective drawing, and ultimately to the mathematics of <b>projective</b> geometry of Girard Desargues and Jean-Victor Poncelet.|$|E
5|$|Geometry was {{a second}} field in which groups were used systematically, {{especially}} symmetry groups as part of Felix Klein's 1872 Erlangen program. After novel geometries such as hyperbolic and <b>projective</b> geometry had emerged, Klein used group theory to organize them in a more coherent way. Further advancing these ideas, Sophus Lie founded the study of Lie groups in 1884.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{founded the}} field of {{continuous}} geometry based on lattice theoretic principles. Earlier, Menger and Birkhoff had axiomatized complex <b>projective</b> geometry {{in terms of the}} properties of its lattice of linear subspaces. Von Neumann, following his work on rings of operators, weakened those axioms to describe a broader class of lattices, the continuous geometries.|$|E
