5|$|A copy of {{the film}} leaked onto <b>peer-to-peer</b> file sharing {{networks}} just hours after opening in theaters. The film was a time-stamped workprint, suggesting it {{may have come from}} within the industry rather than from someone who videotaped an advance screening. Eight people were later charged with copyright infringement and distributing material illegally. Documents filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney allege that a {{copy of the}} film was taken from an unnamed Californian post-production office by an employee, who later pleaded guilty to his charges. The illegal copy was passed among seven people until reaching an eighth party, who also pleaded guilty to uploading to an unnamed P2P network.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} part of the {{confidential}} data stolen in the Sony Pictures hack incident; it was leaked onto <b>peer-to-peer</b> file sharing websites on November 27, 2014, over a month ahead of its scheduled release. Along with it came Fury and three other unreleased Sony Pictures films (Annie, Mr. Turner and To Write Love on Her Arms). Within three days of the leak, Still Alice had been downloaded by an estimated 103,832 unique IP addresses.|$|E
5|$|During the {{transition}} from MS-DOS to Windows, the success of Microsoft's product Microsoft Office allowed the company to gain ground on application-software competitors, such as WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3. Novell, an owner of WordPerfect for a time, alleged that Microsoft used its inside knowledge of the DOS and Windows kernels and of undocumented Application Programming Interface features to make Office perform better than its competitors. Eventually, Microsoft Office became the dominant business suite, with a market share far exceeding that of its competitors. In March 1992, Microsoft released Windows 3.1 along with its first promotional campaign on TV; the software sold over three million copies in its first two months on the market. In October, Windows for Workgroups 3.1 was released with integrated networking abilities such as <b>peer-to-peer</b> file and printing sharing. In November, Microsoft released {{the first version of}} their popular database software Microsoft Access.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} before its release, a number of texts {{purporting}} to be genuine leaks appeared in various forms. On 16 July, a set of photographs representing all 759 pages of the U.S. edition was leaked and was fully transcribed prior to the official release date. The photographs later appeared on websites and <b>peer-to-peer</b> networks, leading Scholastic to seek a subpoena {{in order to identify}} one source. This represented the most serious security breach in the Harry Potter series' history. Rowling and her lawyer confirmed that there were genuine online leaks. Reviews published in both The Baltimore Sun and The New York Times on 18 July 2007, corroborated many of the plot elements from this leak, and about one day prior to release, The New York Times confirmed that the main circulating leak was real.|$|E
5|$|Quantico {{continues}} to be popular in Australia, Canada, France and India. The premiere episode had 2.6 million viewers in Canada, the largest audience for a new television series that year. It was the most-watched episode, behind The Big Bang Theory (which had 2.8 million). Averaging 2.17 million viewers, Quantico was Canada's most-watched drama series, most-watched new series and second-most-watched series (after The Big Bang Theory) in 2015. It was the most-watched drama series of 2015 in Australia and the second-most-watched series overall (after The Big Bang Theory). In France, the series premiered to 4.9 million viewers (a 21-percent audience share) and averaged 3.1 million viewers during its first season. According to a Business Insider report (with 2.1million views per month), Quantico was the 12th-most-popular TV show of 2016 based on ratings, <b>peer-to-peer</b> sharing, social-media chatter and viewer demand.|$|E
5|$|St. Anger is {{the eighth}} studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, {{released}} on June 5, 2003, by Elektra Records. It was the band's last album released through Elektra, and the second-longest timespan between studio albums from Metallica, with nearly six {{years between the}} release of Reload and this album. It is also the final collaboration between Metallica and producer Bob Rock, whose relationship began with the band's fifth studio album, 1991's Metallica. St. Anger was originally intended for release on June 10, 2003, but was released five days earlier due to concerns over unlicensed distribution through <b>peer-to-peer</b> file sharing networks. The St. Anger sessions also mark the only time Rock played when the music was being recorded, filling in for the departed bassist Jason Newsted.|$|E
5|$|St. Anger was {{released}} on June 5, 2003. It was originally scheduled for June 10, but due to Metallica's previous battle with Napster, and fear {{that it would be}} released illegally onto <b>peer-to-peer</b> file sharing networks, the band pushed the release date ahead by five days. A special edition of the album {{was released}} with a bonus DVD, featuring live, in-the-studio rehearsals of all of the St. Anger tracks. First week sales of the album were 417,000 copies, and it debuted at number 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200, as well as in 30 other countries around the world. In 2004, Metallica won the award for Best Metal Performance, for the title track.|$|E
5|$|Valve offers Steamworks, an {{application}} programming interface (API) that provides development and publishing tools {{to take advantage of}} Steam client's features, free-of-charge to game and software developers. Steamworks provides networking and player authentication tools for both server and <b>peer-to-peer</b> multiplayer games, matchmaking services, support for Steam community friends and groups, Steam statistics and achievements, integrated voice communications, and Steam Cloud support, allowing games to integrate with the Steam client. The API also provides anti-cheating devices and digital copy management. Developers of software available on Steam are able to track sales of their titles through the Steam store. In February 2014, Valve announced that it would begin to allow developers to set up their own sales for their games independent of any sales that Valve may set.|$|E
25|$|Whether or not sharing files over a <b>peer-to-peer</b> network {{falls within}} the scope of this {{prohibition}} has been controversial. Some groups, such as the Audionautes, have contended that the act of receiving copyrighted works from Internet sites or <b>peer-to-peer</b> networks is an act of private copying, which is a valid exemption from copyright rules, following from CPI L122-5. Courts have ruled in both directions, some convicting <b>peer-to-peer</b> users, others acquitting them.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} <b>peer-to-peer</b> file sharing networks, such as Napster, {{relied on a}} central database to co-ordinate look ups on the network. Second generation <b>peer-to-peer</b> networks, such as Gnutella, used flooding to locate files, searching every node on the network. Third generation <b>peer-to-peer</b> networks use Distributed hash tables to look up files in the network. Distributed hash tables store resource locations throughout the network. A major criterion for these protocols is locating the desired nodes quickly.|$|E

25|$|Article 14 bis of the DADVSI law {{explicitly}} exempts {{from this}} regime {{the act of}} downloading a copyrighted work on a <b>peer-to-peer</b> network. This exemption is further extended to the act of making some copyrighted work {{available to the public}} without any commercial purpose, when this is an automatic result of the use of a <b>peer-to-peer</b> network for obtaining it; this clause was added because many <b>peer-to-peer</b> networks automatically make downloaded content available to other users, thus merely exempting downloads from the counterfeiting felony would not have been sufficient.|$|E

25|$|Napster {{was started}} in 1999 by Shawn Fanning, then an 18-year-old {{freshman}} computer science student at Northeastern University. It provided a platform for users to access and download compressed digital music files, specifically MP3s, from other users' machines. Unlike many <b>peer-to-peer</b> services, however, Napster included a central server that indexed connected users and files available on their machines, creating a searchable list of music available across Napster's network. Napster's ease of use compared to other <b>peer-to-peer</b> services quickly made it a popular service for music enthusiasts to find and download digital song files for free.|$|E

In a later interview with Paul Thurrott, Allchin later expressed his desire for developers to create applications with support for these <b>peer-to-peer</b> capabilities.|$|E
