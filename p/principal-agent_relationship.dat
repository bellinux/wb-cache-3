40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of the literature on nonprofit <b>principal-agent</b> <b>relationships.</b> It depicts the nature of agency theory and stewardship theory, analyzes the origin of their struggle within the nonprofit structure, and marks directions for a conciliatory approach. We open with an introduction to agency theory and discuss the two main components of its mathematical branch. We thereby contrast it with steward-ship theory and elaborate on the arguments that can affect the position of nonprofit <b>principal-agent</b> <b>relationships</b> on the stewardship-agency axis. Analysis of the existing literature points to a lack of consensus as to which theory should be applied. We argue that the division of nonprofit <b>principal-agent</b> <b>relationships</b> into board-manager and manager-employee interactions may help to clarify the balance between agency theory and stewardship theory and may lead to the establishment of a strongly founded theory on nonprofit <b>principal-agent</b> <b>relationships.</b> We close with a discussion of how this article may prove valuable to nonprofit policymakers and other empirical researchers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to provide a more {{comprehensive}} principal–agent theory of nonprofit organizations by combining agency theory with aspects of stakeholder theory, stewardship theory, and empirical literature on the governance and management of nonprofit organizations. First, the use of a stakeholder perspective allows us to identify the principals of a nonprofit organization and to divide nonprofit <b>principal–agent</b> <b>relationships</b> into different categories. Next, we discuss the assumptions and prescriptions of agency theory and stewardship theory and suggest that a complementary use of these theories can contribute to the research of <b>principal–agent</b> <b>relationships.</b> By discussing empirical literature from a stewardship–agency perspective, we are able to address issues of nonprofit accountability. We conclude by giving suggestions for further research and by stressing the importance of a recruitment policy to avoid internal agency problems.

50|$|The Second Indentured Servitude Contract, 1619-1620: By 1619, however, a {{new system}} had been introduced. The Virginia Company still paid for the {{transportation}} costs of the laborers, but the laborers were no longer contracted to work exclusively for the company once they arrived. Instead, free planters in the colony would rent the new laborers from the company for a year at a fixed rate, in addition to covering their maintenance costs during that year. The Company believed that this system would yield a number of advantages. The new migrants’ placement with established planters would {{provide them with a}} place to live immediately after arrival, so the Company would not be responsible for funding their maintenance once in Virginia ay longer. Additionally, the established planters would train the laborers so that when their year of private service expired, they would have the skills necessary to provide for themselves in these new conditions and socio-political structure.Issues arose however, when the value of labor rose sharply due to the tobacco boom. Private employers began trying to acquire additional labor for their tobacco farms by enticing laborers on other farms with promises of shorter terms of service. The prevalence of this practice became so severe that in 1619 the General Assembly had issue an order that stipulated that indentured servants had to remain in service to the original planter who rented them for their entire contracted term of service. The Company’s new rental policies also introduced an additional <b>principal-agent</b> <b>relationship</b> between the Company and the private planters. The Company became concerned that there were insufficient incentives for the planters to adequately maintain the health and wellbeing of laborers, since they only rented them for one year. High rates of mortality and instances of runaways became the economic burden of the Company, which maintained legal ownership of the servants during their rental tenures.|$|E

40|$|Over {{recent decades}} governments have {{increasingly}} delegated {{domestic and international}} regulatory functions to private-sector agents. This article examines the reasons for such delegation and how private agents differ from public ones, and then analyzes the politics of regulation post delegation. It argues that the key difference between delegation to a public agent and delegation to a private one {{is that in the}} latter case a multiple-principals problem emerges that is qualitatively different from the one usually considered in the literature. An agent’s action will be determined by the relative tightness of competing <b>principal–agent</b> <b>relationships.</b> This tightness {{is a function of the}} relative importance of each principal for the agent’s financial and operational viability as well as its effectiveness in rule making.

40|$|In this study, {{we propose}} our {{hypothesis}} that the distinguishable <b>principal-agent</b> <b>relationships</b> of German banks are significantly influencing the risk-taking attitudes of bank managers. Particularly, we intend to substantiate the theory that banks owned by dispersed shareholders or federal state authorities face a higher relevance of principal-agent problems than other banking sectors due to a missing ability to monitor bank managers. Our results underline that these problems appear to mislead bank managers showing an unreasonable risk-taking behavior. In a first stage, we rely on a theoretical model explaining that from the bank owners' viewpoint three factors of the <b>principal-agent</b> <b>relationships</b> are determining the probability of choosing the optimal portfolio of risky assets. These factors cover {{the ability to control}} bank managers, the risk pooling capabilities of bank owners and bank managers, and the incentives of seeking high returns. To support our hypothesis we apply an empirical study to the distances-to-default of different German banking sectors. This demonstrates that risktaking attitudes of banks are closely related to banks' ownership. Consequently, our findings offer evidence, that legislative and regulatory authorities should increase their vigilance in terms of principal-agent problems within certain sectors of the banking industry...|$|R

Although knowledge makes an agent more productive (productivity effect), knowledge transfer could cause the agent to become self-employed.
