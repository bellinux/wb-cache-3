Holdings include 50million pages of presidential documents, over 1.6million photographs, a half-million feet of motion <b>picture</b> <b>film</b> and thousands of audio and video tapes. The library also houses personal papers collections including documents from Reagan's eight years as Governor of California.|$|E
5|$|Major film {{studios in}} England include Pinewood, Elstree and Shepperton. Some {{of the most}} commercially {{successful}} films of all time have been produced in England, including two of the highest-grossing film franchises (Harry Potter and James Bond). Ealing Studios in London has a claim to being the oldest continuously working film studio in the world. Famous for recording many motion <b>picture</b> <b>film</b> scores, the London Symphony Orchestra first performed film music in 1935.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of the {{following}} year, steps began to make coin operation, via a nickel slot, part of {{the mechanics of the}} viewing system. By autumn 1892, the design of the Kinetoscope was essentially complete. The filmstrip, based on stock manufactured first by Eastman, and then, from April 1893 onward, by New York's Blair Camera Co., was 35 mm (1 3/8inches) wide; each vertically sequenced frame bore a rectangular image and four perforations on each side. Within a few years, this basic format would be adopted globally as the standard for motion <b>picture</b> <b>film,</b> which it remains to this day. The publication in the October 1892 Phonogram of cinematographic sequences shot in the format demonstrates that the Kinetograph had already been reconfigured to produce movies with the new film.|$|E

25|$|Color motion <b>picture</b> <b>film</b> refers both to unexposed color {{photographic}} film in a format {{suitable for use}} in a motion picture camera, and to finished motion <b>picture</b> <b>film,</b> ready {{for use in a}} projector, which bears images in color.|$|E
25|$|With color motion <b>picture</b> <b>film,</b> {{information}} about {{the color of the}} light at each image point is also captured. This is done by analyzing the visible spectrum of color into several regions (normally three, commonly referred to by their dominant colors: red, green and blue) and recording each region separately.|$|E
25|$|The CIA {{organized}} the January 1953 Robertson Panel of scientists to debunk {{the data collected}} by the Air Force's Project Blue Book.

25|$|The first {{regularly}} scheduled television {{service in the}} United States began on July 2, 1928, fifteen months before the United Kingdom. The Federal Radio Commission authorized C. F. Jenkins to broadcast from experimental station W3XK in Wheaton Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C. For {{at least the first}} eighteen months, 48-line silhouette images from motion <b>picture</b> <b>film</b> were broadcast, although beginning in the summer of 1929 he occasionally broadcast in halftones.|$|E
25|$|Their success {{would lead}} the duo on to star in movies and TV shows, become product spokespersons and {{household}} names, but also associated them with marijuana use in the media. The most immediate results of their success was their co-starring roles in the major motion <b>picture</b> <b>film</b> How High, their endorsement deal for Right Guard, Redman's starring role in Seed of Chucky and a short-lived sitcom on Fox Television entitled Method & Red.|$|E
25|$|Motion <b>picture</b> <b>film,</b> {{primarily}} because of the rem-jet backing, requires different processing than standard C-41 process color film. The process necessary is ECN-2, which has an initial step using an alkaline bath to remove the backing layer. There are also minor differences in the remainder of the process. If motion picture negative is run through a standard C-41 color film developer bath, the rem-jet backing partially dissolves and destroys the integrity of the developer and, potentially, ruins the film.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to his audio recordings, many of Bernstein's concerts from the 1970s onwards were recorded on motion <b>picture</b> <b>film</b> by the German film company Unitel. This included a complete cycle of the Mahler symphonies (with the Vienna Philharmonic and London Symphony Orchestra), as well as complete cycles of the Beethoven, Brahms and Schumann symphonies recorded at the same series of concerts as the audio recordings by Deutsche Grammophon. Many of these films appeared on Laserdisc and are now on DVD.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of high gain, low noise, high frequency response or, equivalently, ultra-fast response, and large area of collection has maintained photomultipliers an essential place in nuclear and particle physics, astronomy, medical diagnostics including blood tests, medical imaging, motion <b>picture</b> <b>film</b> scanning (telecine), radar jamming, and high-end image scanners known as drum scanners. Elements of photomultiplier technology, when integrated differently, {{are the basis}} of night vision devices. Research that analyzes light scattering, such as the study of polymers in solution often use a laser and a PMT to collect the scattered light data.|$|E
25|$|Problems {{have been}} {{encountered}} attempting to use otherwise high CRI LED lighting on {{film and video}} sets. The color spectra of LED lighting primary colors does not match the expected color wavelength bandpasses of film emulsions and digital sensors. As a result, color rendition can be completely unpredictable in optical prints, transfers to digital media from film (DI's), and video camera recordings. This phenomenon with respect to motion <b>picture</b> <b>film</b> has been documented in an LED lighting evaluation series of tests produced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences scientific staff.|$|E

25|$|Smith's {{interest}} in novel forms of entertainment led him toward early experiments with motion <b>picture</b> <b>film,</b> and in 1897 he began making short films on the St. Ann's Well grounds. By {{the time of}} Smith's foray into filmmaking, Bayley had had wide experience in comic acting for pantomime and revues, and Smith drew extensively on her knowledge of visual humor and audience tastes. She played lead roles in many of his most significant films, including Hanging out the Clothes (1897), Santa Claus (1898), Cinderella (1898), The Kiss in the Tunnel (1899), As Seen Through the Telescope (1900), Let Me Dream Again (1900), Dorothy's Dream (1900), and Mary Jane's Mishap (1903). Bayley also appeared in some of Smith's 1906 and 1908 tests of the color-film process Kinemacolor.|$|E
