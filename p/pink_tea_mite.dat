60|$|This {{is not an}} over-coloured picture. Can we not see, then, {{what was}} the inner reason for the war? Can we not {{understand}} that it was needful to shake mankind loose from gossip and <b>pink</b> <b>teas,</b> and sword-worship, and Saturday night drunks, and self-seeking politics and theological quibbles--to wake them up and make them realise that they stand upon a narrow knife-edge between two awful eternities, and that, here and now, they have to finish with make-beliefs, and with real earnestness and courage face those truths which have always been palpable where indolence, or cowardice, or vested interests have not obscured the vision. Let us try to appreciate what those truths are and the direction which reform must take. It is the new spiritual developments which predominate in my own thoughts, {{but there are two}} other great readjustments which are necessary before they can take their full effect. On the spiritual side I can speak with the force of knowledge from the beyond. On the other two points of reform, I make no such claim.|$|R
5000|$|Rosa Nevada {{is a white}} rose {{cultivar}} {{developed by}} Pedro Dot in Spain in 1927.

It is probably a cross between Dots <b>pink</b> hybrid <b>tea</b> La Giralda (introduced in 1926) and the wild rose species Rosa pimpinellifolia var. altaica (synonym R.

6000|$|I {{notice that}} it is {{customary}} for the daily papers to publish a column or so of society gossip. They generally head it [...] "Chit-Chat," [...] or [...] "On Dit," [...] or [...] "Le Boudoir," [...] or something of the sort, and they keep it pretty full of French terms {{to give it the}} proper sort of swing. These columns may be very interesting in their way, but it always seems to me that they don't get hold of quite the right things to tell us about. They are very fond, for instance, of giving an account of the delightful dance at Mrs. De Smythe's--at which Mrs. De Smythe looked charming in a gown of old tulle with a stomacher of passementerie--or of the dinner-party at Mr. Alonzo Robinson's residence, or the smart <b>pink</b> <b>tea</b> given by Miss Carlotta Jones. No, that's all right, but it's {{not the kind of thing}} we want to get at; those are not the events which happen in our neighbours' houses that we really want to hear about. It is the quiet little family scenes, the little traits of home-life that--well, for example, take the case of that delightful party at the De Smythes. I am certain that all those who were present would much prefer a little paragraph like the following, which would give them some idea of the home-life of the De Smythes on the morning after the party.|$|R
40|$|The Servo agro spray oil (petroleum based {{horticulture}} oil) {{was evaluated}} {{in the laboratory}} against <b>tea</b> red spider <b>mite,</b> Oligonychus coffeae to determine its effect on adult mortality, viability of eggs, oviposition deterrence and repellent properties. The same was also evaluated {{in the field to}} determine its effect on mite population. Direct spray method was used in the laboratory at concentrations of 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 %. Mortality of O. coffeae was both concentration and time dependent. Deposition of eggs by adult mites on treated leaf surfaces decreased significantly and the viability of eggs was also significantly reduced. In addition, different concentrations of the Servo agro spray also exhibited repellent properties against adult mites. In the field Servo agro spray oil significantly reduced the mite population and its bio-efficacy was comparable to that of the synthetic pesticide (propargite 57 EC). No phytotoxic effect was observed when tea bushes were sprayed with different doses of Servo agro spray. Tea samples were taint free. Quality (appearance of liquor, flavour, taint and taste) of made tea was not adversely affected by treatments with Servo agro spray oil. Therefore Servo agro spray oil may be a potential agent {{to be used in the}} sustainable management of <b>tea</b> red spider <b>mite...</b>|$|R
