In a traditional pie, the primary ingredient is the <b>pilchard</b> (sardine), although mackerel or herring {{is used as a}} substitute. Richard Stevenson, chef at The Ship Inn in Mousehole, suggests that any white fish will work for the filling, with pilchards or herring just added for the presentation.

The original Pocomoke City bypass from US 13 to MD 756 was resurfaced with bituminous concrete in 1969, the same year work began to establish a four-lane divided highway from Pocomoke City to Snow Hill. The second, northbound carriageway of the highway was constructed from east of <b>Pilchard</b> Creek to Blades Road between 1969 and 1971 and from Blades Road to {{the south end of}} the Snow Hill bypass in 1970 and 1971. US 113 was relocated as a four-lane divided highway from its US 13 intersection to east of <b>Pilchard</b> Creek, over which a new bridge was built for the northbound carriageway, starting in 1972. The now-bypassed 1936 Pocomoke City bypass was redesignated MD 359 after the completion of the new bypass in late 1974. The two-lane Snow Hill bypass was built as the southbound carriageway of an eventual divided highway from its south end to MD 12 in 1971 and 1972 and from MD 12 to north of Snow Hill between 1973 and 1975; the latter section included a three-span bridge across Purnell Branch. The bypassed portion of US 113 through Snow Hill became MD 394 in 1976. MD 394 was redesignated US 113 Business after AASHTO approved the new designation at its spring 1997 meeting.|$|E
5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} cephalopods, bony fishes, and other {{cartilaginous}} fishes, the copper shark is a fast-swimming predator {{that has been}} known to hunt in large groups, utilizing their numbers to their advantage; however for {{most of the time they}} remain solitary. Off South Africa, this species associates closely with the annual sardine run, involving millions of southern African <b>pilchard</b> (Sardinops sagax). Like other requiem sharks, it is viviparous, with the developing embryos mainly nourished through a placental connection formed from the depleted yolk sac. Females bear litters of 7 to 24 pups every other year in coastal nursery areas, after a gestation period of 12 or perhaps as long as 21 months. It is extremely slow-growing, with males and females not reaching maturity until 13–19 and 19–20 years of age respectively.|$|E

40|$|Freshly caught <b>pilchards</b> (Sardinops neopilchardus) were {{obtained}} from South Australia and subjected to chilled and frozen storage trials {{in order to determine}} their stability. The stability was gauged by visual and sensory asscssment of the raw <b>pilchards,</b> by sensory assessment of the odour and flavour of cooked samples and by the chemical measures of peroxide value and levels of free fatty acids. There was considerable variability in fat content between individual fish with average content over all samples analysed in the trial being about 4 to 5 %. In chilled storage, the <b>pilchards</b> exhibited obvious deterioration within two days. Substantial peroxide values were found and oxidised odours and flavours were clearly evident after 4 days’ chilled storage. In frozen storage, oxidation occurred after only one month at a temperature of - 20 °C. This could bcdelayed if thc fish were glazed with water. Vacuum packaging in a film of low permeability to oxygen was less effective than glazing and is not recommended due to cost. <b>Pilchards</b> in which oxidation had commenced before freezing continued to oxidise in frozen storage irrespective of whether they were glazcd or vacuum packed. It was thus thoroughly demonstrated that the oil in the <b>pilchards</b> is very readily oxidised and careful handling, chilling, freezing and storage procedures need to be adopted to provide a product which is a nutritionally sound feed material for captive tuna. The demerit point scoring system was found to be a rapid evaluative technique useful for estimating the statc of the <b>pilchards...</b>|$|R
60|$|In {{observing the}} coming in of those <b>pilchards,</b> as above, {{we found that}} out at sea, in the offing, beyond {{the mouth of the}} harbour, there was a whole army of porpoises, which, as they told us, pursued the <b>pilchards,</b> and, it is probable, drove them into the harbour, as above. The school, it seems, drove up the river a great way, even as high as Totnes Bridge, as we heard afterwards; so that the country people who had boats and nets catched as many as they knew what to do with, and perhaps lived upon <b>pilchards</b> for several days. But as to the merchants and trade, their coming was so sudden that it was no {{advantage}} to them.|$|R
25|$|Due to the {{collapse}} of a commercial <b>pilchard</b> fishery in 1960, African penguin diet has shifted towards anchovies to some extent, although available <b>pilchard</b> biomass is still a notable determinant of penguin population development and breeding success. While a diet of anchovy appears to be generally sufficient, it is not ideal due to lower concentrations of fat and protein. Penguin diet changes throughout the year; as in many seabirds, it is believed that the interaction of diet choice and breeding success helps the penguins maintain their population size. Although parent penguins are protective of their hatchlings, they will not incur nutritional deficits themselves if prey is scarce and hunting requires greater time or energy commitment. This may lead to higher rates of brood loss under poor food conditions.|$|E

25|$|Most years, off {{southern}} Africa between May and July, {{billions of}} sardines (specifically the Southern African <b>pilchard</b> Sardinops sagax) spawn {{in the cool}} waters of the Agulhas Bank and move northward along {{the east coast of}} South Africa. This great fish migration is called the sardine run. Their sheer numbers create a feeding frenzy along the coastline. The run, containing millions of individual sardines, occurs when a current of cold water heads north from the Agulhas Bank up to Mozambique where it then leaves the coastline and goes further east into the Indian Ocean. During the sardine run, as many as 18,000 dolphins, behaving like sheepdogs, herd the sardines into bait balls, or corral them in shallow water. Once rounded up, the dolphins and other predators take turns ploughing through the bait balls, gorging on the fish as they sweep through. Seabirds also attack them from above, flocks of gannets, cormorants, terns and gulls. The sardine run is featured in the first episode of the 2001 BBC nature documentary The Blue Planet and in the 2008 3D IMAX documentary film Wild Ocean.|$|E

500|$|In {{the northwestern}} Atlantic, around 60% of the dusky shark's diet {{consists}} of bony fishes, from over ten families with bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) and summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) being especially important.

In South African and Australian waters, bony fishes are again the most important prey type.

The run of the southern African <b>pilchard</b> (Sardinops sagax), occurring off the eastern coast of South Africa every winter, is attended by medium and large-sized dusky sharks.

Accusations of illegal overfishing by the French and Spanish fleets is a source of local friction.

40|$|Baited remote {{underwater}} video stations (BRUVS) {{are increasingly}} being used to examine assemblages of fishes, yet critical methodological questions related to sampling limitations and bias, such as the influence of bait type, remain poorly understood. At multiple locations, we examined the hypothesis that diversity and abundance in temperate reef fish assemblages were independent of bait type. We used 3 bait types (abalone viscera, <b>pilchards</b> and crushed urchin) and quantified commonly used metrics for the fish assemblage, including species richness, time of first arrival and relative abundance on 3 shallow rocky reefs in southeastern Australia over 2 yr. We distinguished the following 6 feeding guilds: herbivore, zooplanktivore, alga/invertebrate consumers, invertebrate carnivore, macroinvertebrate carnivore and generalist carnivore. The response of fishes was dependent on bait type, with urchin bait performing particularly poorly. Although we did not detect statistical differences between the performance of <b>pilchards</b> and abalone viscera as bait, <b>pilchards</b> produced more consistent outcomes. Importantly, we also observed strong spatial effects. In general, bait type had a marked effect on species richness, but little influence on relative abundance.
