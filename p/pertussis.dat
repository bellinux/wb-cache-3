5|$|In the United States, {{vaccine is}} {{administered}} {{along with the}} tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular <b>pertussis</b> vaccines (DTaP) and a pediatric dose of hepatitis B vaccine. In the UK, IPV is combined with tetanus, diphtheria, <b>pertussis,</b> and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines.|$|E
5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} acute care, {{emergency}} medicine can {{also play a}} significant role in public health. Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and <b>pertussis</b> can be administered by emergency departments, patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling for substance abuse, and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data, because of the high number of patients. Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as the first line of defense in disaster scenarios.|$|E
5|$|Néstor Carlos Kirchner {{was born}} on 25 February 1950, in Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz, a federal {{territory}} at the time. His father, Néstor Carlos Kirchner Sr., met the Chilean María Juana Ostoić by telegraphy. They had three children: Néstor, Alicia, and María Cristina. Néstor {{was part of the}} third generation of Kirchners living in the city. As a result of <b>pertussis,</b> he developed strabismus at an early age; however, he refused medical treatment because he considered his eye part of his self-image. When Kirchner was in high school he briefly considered becoming a teacher, but poor diction hampered him; he was also unsuccessful at basketball.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pertussis</b> toxin {{does not}} have a {{specific}} receptor, and binds to sialylated glycoproteins. After endocytosis, <b>pertussis</b> toxin's mechanism is the same as cholera toxin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pertussis</b> {{is caused}} by the {{bacterium}} Bordetella <b>pertussis.</b> It is an airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person.|$|E
25|$|In 1932 an {{outbreak}} of whooping cough hit Atlanta, Georgia, prompting pediatrician Leila Denmark to begin her study of the disease. Over {{the next six years}} her work was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, and in partnership with Emory University and Eli Lilly & Company, she developed the first <b>pertussis</b> vaccine. In 1942 American scientists Grace Eldering, Loney Gordon, and Pearl Kendrick combined the whole-cell <b>pertussis</b> vaccine with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids to generate the first DTP combination vaccine. To minimize the frequent side effects caused by the <b>pertussis</b> component, Japanese scientist Yuji Sato developed an acellular vaccine consisting of purified haemagglutinins (HAs: filamentous strep throat and leucocytosis-promoting-factor HA), which are secreted by B. <b>pertussis.</b> Sato's acellular <b>pertussis</b> vaccine was used in Japan starting in 1981. Later versions of the acellular vaccine in other countries consisted of additional defined components of B. <b>pertussis</b> and were often part of the DTaP combination vaccine.|$|E
25|$|This {{family is}} also known as Ptx and {{contains}} the toxin responsible for whooping cough. <b>Pertussis</b> toxin is secreted by the gram-negative bacterium, Bordetella <b>pertussis.</b> Whooping cough is very contagious and cases are slowly increasing in the United States despite vaccination. Symptoms include paroxysmal cough with whooping and even vomiting. The bacterium Bordetella <b>pertussis</b> was first identified as the cause of whooping cough and isolated by Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou in France in 1900.|$|E
25|$|Serology may be {{used for}} adults and {{adolescents}} who have already been infected for several weeks to determine whether antibody against <b>pertussis</b> toxin or another virulence factor of B. <b>pertussis</b> is present at high levels in the blood of the person. By this stage, they have been contagious for some weeks and may have spread the infection to many people. Because of this, adults, who are not in great danger from <b>pertussis,</b> are increasingly being encouraged to be vaccinated.|$|E
25|$|The classic {{symptoms}} of <b>pertussis</b> are a paroxysmal cough, inspiratory whoop, and fainting, or vomiting after coughing. The cough from <b>pertussis</b> {{has been documented}} to cause subconjunctival hemorrhages, rib fractures, urinary incontinence, hernias, and vertebral artery dissection. Violent coughing can cause the pleura to rupture, leading to a pneumothorax. Vomiting after a coughing spell or an inspiratory whooping sound on coughing, almost doubles {{the likelihood that the}} illness is <b>pertussis.</b> The absence of a paroxysmal cough or posttussive emesis, though, makes it almost half as likely.|$|E
25|$|Infection in newborns is {{particularly}} severe. <b>Pertussis</b> is fatal in an estimated 1.6% of hospitalized US infants under {{one year of}} age. First-year infants {{are also more likely}} to develop complications, such as: pneumonia (20%), encephalopathy (0.3%), seizures (1%), failure to thrive, and death (1%)—perhaps due to the ability of the bacterium to suppress the immune system. <b>Pertussis</b> can cause severe paroxysm-induced cerebral hypoxia, and 50% of infants admitted to hospital suffer apneas. Reported fatalities from <b>pertussis</b> in infants increased substantially from 1990 to 2010.|$|E
25|$|In {{children}} under the age of seven, the tetanus vaccine is often administered as a combined vaccine, DPT/DTaP vaccine, which also includes vaccines against diphtheria and <b>pertussis.</b> For adults and children over seven, the Td vaccine (tetanus and diphtheria) or Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular <b>pertussis)</b> is commonly used.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pertussis</b> is {{the only}} vaccine-preventable disease that is {{associated}} with increasing deaths in the U.S. The number of deaths increased from four in 1996 to 17 in 2001, almost all of which were infants under one year. In Canada, the number of <b>pertussis</b> infections has varied between 2,000 and 10,000 reported cases each year over the last ten years, and it is the most common vaccine-preventable illness in Toronto.|$|E
25|$|Organisms {{spread by}} droplet {{transmission}} include respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus), Bordetella <b>pertussis,</b> pneumococci, diphtheria, and rubella.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pertussis</b> {{is caused}} by the {{bacterium}} Bordetella <b>pertussis.</b> It is an airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. People are infectious to others from the start of symptoms until about three weeks into the coughing fits. Those treated with antibiotics are no longer infectious after five days. Diagnosis is by collecting a sample {{from the back of the}} nose and throat. This sample can then be tested by either culture or by polymerase chain reaction.|$|E
25|$|B. <b>pertussis</b> was {{discovered}} in 1906 by Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou, who also developed the first serology and vaccine. Efforts to develop an inactivated whole-cell vaccine began soon after B. <b>pertussis</b> was cultured that year. In the 1920s, Louis W. Sauer developed a weak vaccine for whooping cough at Evanston Hospital (Evanston, IL). In 1925 Danish physician Thorvald Madsen {{was the first to}} test a whole-cell vaccine on a wide scale. Madsen used the vaccine to control outbreaks in the Faroe Islands in the North Sea.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 Australia {{reported}} {{an average of}} 10,000 cases a year, {{and the number of}} cases had increased. In the U.S. <b>pertussis</b> in adults has increased significantly since about 2004.|$|E
25|$|A {{reasonable}} guideline is {{to treat}} people age >1 year within 3 weeks of cough onset and infants age <1 year and pregnant women within 6 weeks of cough onset. If the person is diagnosed late, antibiotics will not alter {{the course of the}} illness, and even without antibiotics, they should no longer be spreading <b>pertussis.</b> Antibiotics when used early decrease the duration of infectiousness, and thus prevent spread. Short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for 3–5 days) are as effective as long-term treatment (erythromycin 10–14 days) in eliminating B. <b>pertussis</b> with fewer and less severe side effects.|$|E
25|$|In a 1974 report ascribing 36 {{reactions}} to whooping cough (<b>pertussis)</b> vaccine, a prominent public-health academic {{claimed that the}} vaccine was only marginally effective and questioned whether its benefits outweigh its risks, and extended television and press coverage caused a scare. Vaccine uptake in the UK decreased from 81% to 31%, and <b>pertussis</b> epidemics followed, leading {{to the deaths of}} some children. Mainstream medical opinion continued to support the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine; public confidence was restored after the publication of a national reassessment of vaccine efficacy. Vaccine uptake then increased to levels above 90%, and disease incidence declined dramatically.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} devastating {{diseases}} was smallpox, but other deadly diseases included typhus, measles, influenza, bubonic plague, cholera, malaria, tuberculosis, mumps, yellow fever and <b>pertussis,</b> which were chronic in Eurasia.|$|E
25|$|An {{increase}} in lymphocyte concentration {{is usually a}} sign of a viral infection (in some rare case, leukemias are found through an abnormally raised lymphocyte count in an otherwise normal person). A high lymphocyte count with a low neutrophil count might be caused by lymphoma. <b>Pertussis</b> toxin (PTx) of Bordetella <b>pertussis,</b> formerly known as lymphocytosis-promoting factor, causes a decrease in the entry of lymphocytes into lymph nodes, which can lead to a condition known as lymphocytosis, with a complete lymphocyte count of over 4000 per μl in adults or over 8000 per μl in children. This is unique in that many bacterial infections illustrate neutrophil-predominance instead.|$|E
25|$|Immunization {{does not}} confer lifelong immunity; a 2011 CDC study {{indicated}} that protection may only last three to six years. This covers childhood, which {{is the time of}} greatest exposure and greatest risk of death from <b>pertussis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Pertussis</b> {{vaccines}} {{are effective}} at preventing illness and are recommended for routine {{use by the}} World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Two new {{vaccines}} {{were launched}} in 1992. These combined tetanus and diphtheria with acellular <b>pertussis</b> (TDaP or DTaP) {{which could be}} given to adolescents and adults (as opposed to previously when the vaccine was only given to children).|$|E
25|$|The first {{vaccine is}} {{administered}} at infancy. The baby is injected with the DTaP vaccine which is 3 inactive toxins in one injection. DTaP protects against diphtheria, <b>pertussis,</b> and tetanus. This vaccine is safer than the previously used DTP.|$|E
25|$|Both WHO and the CDC {{found that}} the {{acellular}} <b>pertussis</b> vaccines were effective at prevention of the disease, but had a limited impact on infection and transmission, meaning that vaccinated people could act as asymptomatic reservoirs of infection.|$|E
25|$|Tdap {{is given}} as a onetime, first time only dose that {{includes}} the tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular <b>pertussis</b> vaccinations. This should not be administered {{to those who are}} under the age of eleven or over the age of sixty-five.|$|E
25|$|In the {{preparation}} for the 1990 Persian Gulf campaign, whole cell <b>pertussis</b> vaccine {{was used as an}} adjuvant for anthrax vaccine. This produces a more rapid immune response than giving only the anthrax vaccine, which is of some benefit if exposure might be imminent.|$|E
25|$|An {{effect of}} {{widespread}} immunization on {{society has been}} the shift of reported infections from children aged 1–9 years to infants, adolescents, and adults, with adolescents and adults acting as reservoirs for B. <b>pertussis</b> and infecting infants with fewer than three doses of vaccine.|$|E
25|$|In April and May 2012 <b>pertussis</b> was {{declared}} {{to be at}} epidemic levels in Washington, with 3,308 cases. In December 2012 Vermont declared an epidemic of 522 cases. Wisconsin had the highest incidence rate, with 3,877 cases, although it did not make an official epidemic declaration.|$|E
25|$|In the {{vaccination}} moratorium period that occurred when Sweden suspended vaccination against whooping cough (<b>pertussis)</b> from 1979 to 1996, 60% of the country's children contracted the disease {{before the age}} of 10; close medical monitoring kept the death rate from whooping cough at about one per year.|$|E
25|$|People with <b>pertussis</b> are {{infectious}} {{from the}} beginning of the catarrhal stage (a runny nose, sneezing, low-grade fever, symptoms of the common cold) through the third week after the onset of paroxysms (multiple, rapid coughs) or until 5 days after the start of effective antimicrobial treatment.|$|E
25|$|Combinations of {{vaccines}} {{are becoming}} more common; vaccines containing five or more components are used {{in many parts of}} the world. In 2013, Biofarma has released a new product called Pentabio, which is combination vaccine of Diphtheria, Tetanus, <b>Pertussis,</b> Hepatitis B, and Haemophilus Influenzae Type B for baby/infant in Indonesia's Immunization Program.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{method of}} {{prevention}} for <b>pertussis</b> is vaccination. Evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of antibiotics in {{those who have been}} exposed, but are without symptoms. Preventive antibiotics, however, are still frequently used in those who have been exposed and are at high risk of severe disease (such as infants).|$|E
25|$|Uncertainties {{have existed}} of B. <b>pertussis</b> and {{whooping}} cough as a zoonotic disease since around 1910 {{but in the}} 1930s, knowledge was gained that the bacteria lost their virulent power when repeatedly spread on agar media. This explained the difficulties to reproduce results from different studies as the pre-inoculating handlings of the bacteria were not standardized among scientists.|$|E
25|$|The {{concerns}} about side effects led Sato to introduce an even safer acellular vaccine for Japan in 1981 that was approved in the US in 1992 {{for use in}} the combination DTaP vaccine. The acellular vaccine has a rate of adverse events similar to that of a Td vaccine (a tetanus-diphtheria vaccine containing no <b>pertussis</b> vaccine).|$|E
25|$|In {{more than}} 90% of cases {{the cause is}} a viral infection. These viruses may be spread through the air when people cough or by direct contact. Risk factors include {{exposure}} to tobacco smoke, dust, and other air pollution. A small number of cases are due {{to high levels of}} air pollution or bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Bordetella <b>pertussis.</b>|$|E
