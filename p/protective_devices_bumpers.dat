40|$|<b>Protective</b> <b>device</b> {{estimation}} is {{a challenging}} task {{because there are}} numerous <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> present in a typical distribution system. Among various <b>protective</b> <b>devices,</b> auto-reclosers and fuses are the main overcurrent protection on distribution systems. Operation of a <b>protective</b> <b>device</b> {{in response to a}} particular fault condition depends upon the <b>protective</b> <b>device?s</b> operating behavior and coordination of various such <b>protective</b> <b>devices.</b> This thesis presents the design and implementation of a <b>protective</b> <b>device</b> estimation algorithm which helps in identifying which <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> have operated to clear a short circuit condition. The algorithm uses manufacturer?s device details, power quality data measured from substation monitoring devices and power system event features estimated using existing DFA algorithms. The proposed technique can be used to evaluate coordination of these <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> and helps in locating a fault in a distribution system feeder. This approach is independent of feeder topology and could be readily used for any distribution system. The effectiveness of this algorithm is verified by simulated and actual test data.

In this study, the phenomenology and prevalence of self-restraint in individuals showing self-injury and wearing <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> and those showing self-injury but not wearing <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> were compared. A high prevalence of self-restraint in the whole sample of individuals showing self-injury was identified (67 / 88, 76. 1 %), and self-restraint was more prevalent in a group showing self-injury but not wearing <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> (43 / 47, 91. 5 %) than in a group showing self-injury and wearing <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> (24 / 41, 58. 5 %).

Use of personal <b>protective</b> <b>device</b> {{is the best}} control method to protect against hazardous conditions. Hence, this investigation was carried out to determine situation of using of <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> and effective parameters on it, in Qom province workers community in 2006. MethodsThis research is descriptive-sectional study. Sample volume was designed 378 persons working in factories in Qom. First of all, list of Qom factories with noise pollution problems, were collected and 30 important factories among them were selected randomly. In the second stage, 378 persons were selected randomly from workers. The interest information was obtained by questionnaire and collected data were analyzed by SPSS software. ResultsThe obtained results showed that, 83. 6 % of workers have been using ear <b>protective</b> <b>devices.</b> 296 of them, which were using ear <b>protective</b> <b>devices,</b> had an occupational hygienist in their workplaces. This research also showed that, 109 workers that used ear <b>protective</b> <b>devices,</b> had moderate knowledge level. Moreover, 82. 5 % of trained workers have used ear <b>protective</b> <b>devices.</b> The statistical analysis of {{the results showed that}} there were no significant relationship between use of ear <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> and existence of occupational hygienist in workplace, knowledge and age of workers, worker’s antecedent, physical health of workers and kind of ear <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> (p> 0. 05).
