5000|$|Agalinis purpurea (known {{by common}} names {{including}} <b>purple</b> false <b>foxglove</b> and <b>purple</b> gerardia) is an annual forb {{native to the}} eastern United States and Canada, which produces purple flowers in late summer or early fall.|$|R
50|$|Agalinis paupercula, {{commonly}} known as the smallflower false foxglove, is a hemiparasitic annual plant native to the eastern parts of the United States and Canada. Found in open, moist areas, its purple flowers are borne on a 30 to 70 cm stem, and bloom in August and September. The species has often been treated as a variety of Agalinis purpurea, the <b>purple</b> false <b>foxglove,</b> and preliminary genetic evidence suggests that the two are, in fact, a single species.|$|R
25|$|Van Gogh painted Gachet {{resting his}} right elbow {{on a red}} table, head in hand. Two yellow books {{as well as the}} <b>purple</b> {{medicinal}} herb <b>foxglove</b> are displayed on the table. The foxglove in the painting is a plant from which digitalis is extracted for the treatment of certain heart complaints, perhaps an attribute of Gachet as a physician.|$|R
50|$|Digitalis purpurea (foxglove, common foxglove, <b>purple</b> <b>foxglove</b> or lady's glove) is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the plantain family Scrophulariaceae, native to and widespread throughout most of temperate Europe. It is also naturalised in parts of North America and some other temperate regions. The plants are well known as the original source of the heart medicine digoxin (also called digitalis or digitalin).|$|E
50|$|By 1920, {{the company}} {{employed}} about one thousand employees and had 52 buildings on a 200-acre property in Glenolden and Foxcroft, PA. The company property {{was surrounded by}} pastures for horses and cows which were needed to produce serum and antitoxins. The company also grew gardens of plants for research and products, including acres of the <b>purple</b> <b>foxglove</b> flower for the heart medicine digitalis.|$|E
50|$|The taxon was {{originally}} described by Asa Gray in 1878 as Gerardia purpurea var. paupercula, {{a variety of}} the <b>purple</b> false <b>foxglove.</b> He distinguished it from more typical specimens of G. purpurea by its smaller flowers, taller stem, and lighter color. In 1894, Nathaniel Lord Britton recognized it as a separate species, G. paupercula. He transferred it, {{with the rest of}} the North American Gerardia, to Agalinis, as A. paupercula, in 1913. Genetic studies thus far have been unable to distinguish between A. paupercula and A. purpurea, and it is possible that the two species will be consolidated again. However, these studies did not sample a large number of A. paupercula populations and are not definitive.|$|R
60|$|And, {{at times}} like the present one, when the park was still deserted, she liked to wander in that {{miniature}} wood, crushing with delight the moist bed of moss under her feet, letting the dew-covered twigs fall back with a swish against her hands. She found {{her way to a}} tiny glade, where a rough garden seat invited repose. The glade was circular in shape, a perfect audience chamber, wherein to review a whole army of fancies. On the ground a thick carpet of brilliant green with designs of rich sienna formed by last year's leaves, and flecks of silver of young buds not yet scorched by the midday sun; all around, walls of parallel, slender trunks of a tender gray-green colour, with bold patches of glaring viridian and gold intermixed with dull blue shadows. And then a dado of tall bracken fantastic in shape and almost weird in outline, through which there peeped here and there, with insolent luxuriance, clumps of <b>purple</b> and snow-white <b>foxgloves.</b>|$|R
