5|$|Though the plumage of {{the spotted}} green <b>pigeon</b> {{resembles that of}} the Nicobar <b>pigeon</b> in some respects, it is also {{similar to that of}} species in the {{imperial}} <b>pigeon</b> genus Ducula. The metallic-green colouration is commonly found among them, and similar hackles {{can be seen in the}} goliath imperial <b>pigeon</b> (D. goliath). The Polynesian imperial <b>pigeon</b> (D. aurorae) has similar soft feathers, and immature individuals of this species and the Pacific imperial <b>pigeon</b> (D. pacifica) have plumage different from that of juvenile and adult birds until they moult. Therefore, vanGrouw found it possible that the dull, brownish-black underparts of the surviving spotted green <b>pigeon</b> specimen represents the plumage of an immature bird, as the adults of similar birds have stronger and more glossy iridescence. He suggested that the brighter bird with paler underparts and whiter wing tips seen in Latham's illustration may represent the adult plumage.|$|E

Based on behavioural and morphological evidence, Jolyon C. Parish proposed that the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire should be placed in the Gourinae subfamily along with the Groura pigeons and others, in agreement with the genetic evidence.

5|$|The Choiseul <b>pigeon</b> (Microgoura meeki) is an {{extinct species}} of {{bird in the}} <b>pigeon</b> and dove family, Columbidae. It was endemic to the island of Choiseul in the Solomon Islands, {{although}} there are unsubstantiated reports that it may once have lived on several nearby islands. The last confirmed sighting was in 1904. Other common names were Solomons crested <b>pigeon,</b> Solomon Islands crowned-pigeon and Kuvojo.|$|E
5|$|The Choiseul <b>pigeon</b> was not {{searched for}} again until briefly in 1927 {{and again in}} October 1929, when five veteran {{collectors}} belonging to the Whitney South Seas Expedition dedicated three months to searching for the <b>pigeon</b> in multiple locations across Choiseul without success. The indigenous people interviewed by this expedition largely believed that the <b>pigeon</b> was extinct in 1929. The last reported indigenous sighting was sometime in the early 1940s near Sasamungga by the Kolombangara River, although this sighting was never confirmed. Searches of the small, cat-free islands of Rob Roy Island and Wagina off Choiseul's southeast coast and Choiseul's forested coastal swampland in the 1960s by British ornithologist Shane A.

40|$|The {{brain of}} homing <b>pigeons</b> {{seems to be}} {{functionally}} adapted to homing with e. g., larger hippocampi and olfactory bulbs. Furthermore, functional lateralization occurs as well in homing <b>pigeons.</b> Recently, {{the investigation of the}} influence of navigational experience on brain composition and lateralization revealed larger hippocampi in homing <b>pigeons</b> with navigational experience compared to inexperienced homing <b>pigeons.</b> Additionally, there are several brain structures in homing <b>pigeons</b> that show a volumetrical lateralization, whereas homing <b>pigeons</b> with navigational experience show a more lateralized brain than <b>pigeons</b> without navigational experience. This gives more insights in the neuronal basis of orientation and brain development in general but demonstrates as well its complexity. Plasticity and lateralization are much more correlated with individual life history than assumed up to date and have to be more considered in comparative research of evolution...|$|R
5|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{the spotted}} green <b>pigeon</b> was not recorded, but theories {{have been proposed}} based on its physical features. Gibbs found the delicate, part-feathered legs and long tail indicative of at least partially arboreal habits. After noting that the wings were not short after all, van Grouw stated that the bird {{would not have been}} terrestrial, unlike the related Nicobar <b>pigeon.</b> He pointed out that the overall proportions and shape of the bird (longer tail, shorter legs, primary feathers probably reaching the middle of the tail) was more similar to the pigeons of the genus Ducula. It may therefore have been ecologically similar to those birds, have likewise been strongly arboreal, and kept to the dense canopy of forests. By contrast, the mainly terrestrial Nicobar <b>pigeon</b> forages on the forest floor. The dark eyes of the Nicobar <b>pigeon</b> are typical of species that forage on forest floors, whereas the coloured bill and presumably coloured eyes of the spotted green <b>pigeon</b> {{are similar to those of}} frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons. The feet of the spotted green <b>pigeon</b> are also similar to those of pigeons that forage in trees. The slender bill indicates that it fed on soft fruits.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} population {{believed that the}} <b>pigeon</b> became extinct due to predation by feral cats and, to a lesser extent, feral dogs. As Choiseul has no indigenous carnivorous mammals, the ground-dwelling <b>pigeon</b> was particularly susceptible to the introduced cats. If the <b>pigeon</b> existed on islands that feral cats had never reached, {{it is believed that}} the clearance of its forest habitat would have led to its local extinction. As there have been no substantiated reports since 1904 despite multiple searches, the IUCN has declared it extinct. As several ornithologists had visited Choiseul and the nearby islands prior to Meek without noting any sign of the bird's existence, {{it is likely that the}} Choiseul <b>pigeon</b> was already close to extinction in 1904.|$|E

5|$|The spotted green <b>pigeon</b> or Liverpool <b>pigeon</b> (Caloenas maculata) is {{a species}} of <b>pigeon</b> which is most likely extinct. It was first {{mentioned}} and described in 1783 by John Latham, who had seen two specimens of unknown provenance and a drawing depicting the bird. The taxonomic relationships of the bird were long obscure, and early writers suggested many different possibilities, though {{the idea that it}} was related to the Nicobar <b>pigeon</b> (C. nicobarica) prevailed, and it was therefore placed in the same genus, Caloenas. Today, the species is only known from a specimen kept in World Museum, Liverpool. Overlooked for much of the 20th century, it was recognised as a valid extinct species by the IUCN Red List only in 2008. In 2014 a genetic study confirmed it as a distinct species related to the Nicobar <b>pigeon,</b> and showed that the two were the closest relatives of the extinct dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.|$|E
5|$|The spotted green <b>pigeon</b> {{was shown}} to be closest to the Nicobar <b>pigeon.</b> The genetic {{distance}} between the two was more than is seen within other <b>pigeon</b> species, but similar to the distance between different species within the same genus. This confirmed that the two were distinct species in the same genus, and that the spotted green <b>pigeon</b> was a unique, extinct taxon. The Caloenas genus {{was placed in a}} wider clade in which most members showed a mixture of arboreal (tree-dwelling) and terrestrial (ground-dwelling) traits. That Caloenas was placed in such a morphologically diverse clade may explain why many different relationships have previously been proposed for the members of the genus. A third species in the genus Caloenas, the Kanaka <b>pigeon</b> (C. canacorum), is only known from subfossils discovered in New Caledonia and Tonga. This species was larger than the two other members of the genus, so it is unlikely that it represents the same species as the spotted green <b>pigeon.</b> The possibility that the spotted green <b>pigeon</b> was a hybrid between other species can also be disregarded based on the genetic results.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} {{spots of}} the spotted green <b>pigeon</b> {{are not unique}} among pigeons, but are also seen in the spot-winged <b>pigeon</b> (Columba maculosa) and the speckled <b>pigeon</b> (C. guinea), and {{are the result of}} lack of melanin deposition during development. The yellow-buff coloured spots are very worn, while less worn feathers have white tips; this indicates that the former were stained during life or represent a different stage of plumage, and that the latter were fresher. The plumage of the spotted green <b>pigeon</b> was distinct in being very soft compared to that of other pigeons, perhaps due to the body feathers being proportionally long. The hackles were not as elongated as those of the Nicobar <b>pigeon,</b> and the feathers did not differ from those of other pigeons in their microstructure. The plumage was also distinct in being very pigmented, except for the tips of the feathers, and even the down was dark, unlike that of most other birds (a feature otherwise seen in aberrant plumage).|$|E
