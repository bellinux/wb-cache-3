5|$|According to legend, in 832 A.D. Óengus II led {{an army of}} Picts and Scots {{into battle}} against the Angles, led by Æthelstan, near modern-day Athelstaneford, East Lothian. The legend states that whilst engaged in prayer {{on the eve of}} battle, Óengus vowed that if granted victory he would appoint Saint Andrew as the <b>Patron</b> <b>Saint</b> <b>of</b> Scotland; Andrew then {{appeared}} to Óengus that night in a dream and assured him of victory. On the morning of battle white clouds forming the shape of an X were said to have appeared in the sky. Óengus and his combined force, emboldened by this apparent divine intervention, took to the field and despite being inferior in terms of numbers were victorious. Having interpreted the cloud phenomenon as representing the crux decussata upon which Saint Andrew was crucified, Óengus honoured his pre-battle pledge and duly appointed Saint Andrew as the <b>Patron</b> <b>Saint</b> <b>of</b> Scotland. The white saltire set against a celestial blue background {{is said to have been}} adopted as the design of the flag of Scotland on the basis of this legend.|$|E

5|$|When consecrated in 1435 by Archbishop Olaus Laurentii, {{the cathedral}} still was not complete. It was {{dedicated}} to Saint Lawrence, highly cherished in all of Sweden at that time; Saint Eric, the <b>patron</b> <b>saint</b> <b>of</b> Sweden (though never canonised by the Roman Catholic Church); and Saint Olaf, the <b>patron</b> <b>saint</b> <b>of</b> Norway. It was completed over the following decades. Although there are no documentary records of the consecration, there are several references {{from the same period}} to the cathedral's chapels, including their altars which were dedicated to the Holy Cross, to the Virgin Mary or to other saints. The last main component of the cathedral, the towers, were built between 1470 and 1489. The cathedral was damaged by fire on several occasions, especially during the great fire of 1702 which destroyed much of the city. Restoration work was not completed until the middle of the century.|$|E

5|$|Dunstan became <b>patron</b> <b>saint</b> <b>of</b> English goldsmiths and {{silversmith}}s {{because he}} worked as a silversmith making church plate. His Feast Day is 19 May, which is why before the Restoration the date year on London Assay Office hallmarks ran from 19 May one year to 18 May the next, not the calendar year. This was changed at the restoration of Charles II in 1660 so that the hallmarking year began on the King's birthday, 29 May.|$|E
