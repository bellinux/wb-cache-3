The sample included 494 pupils in the fifth, the sixth and the seventh grade of elementary school in {{the first wave of}} data collection, and 269 of them participated in the second wave. It was found that <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> increase in frequency with age. Boys express higher levels of <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> than girls. Statistically significant predictors of concurrent <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> are conflict with parents, peer pressure to accept socially disapproved behaviors, negative school experience and excessive control by father. The longitudinal findings that <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> predict negative school experience one year later, when controlled at the initial levels of school experience, and that excessive control by father and peer pressure predict <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> one year later, when controlled at the initial level of <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors,</b> suggest bidirectional influence between <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> and their correlates...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relations between <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> and early learning outcomes among 138 children in dual-language pre-K programs who were identified {{at the beginning of}} the school year to be at risk for difficulties in early language and literacy development.

Their <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> (externalizing, bullying, hyperactivity, and internalizing) were assessed midyear via teacher ratings. With the exception of internalizing <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors,</b> bivariate correlations indicated virtually no associations between children’s entry-level academic skills and midyear ratings of <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors.</b> However, multilevel models controlling for student- and teacher-level variables revealed that midyear ratings of <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> were statistically significant predictors of poor outcomes on several vocabulary-related measures administered at the end of pre-K...|$|R
25|$|Many {{intensive}} behavioral interventions {{rely heavily}} on discrete trial teaching (DTT) methods, which use stimulus-response-reward techniques to teach foundational skills such as attention, compliance, and imitation. However, children have problems using DTT-taught skills in natural environments. These students are also taught with naturalistic teaching procedures to help generalize these skills. In functional assessment, a common technique, a teacher formulates a clear description of a <b>problem</b> <b>behavior,</b> identifies antecedents, consequences, and other environmental factors that influence and maintain the behavior, develops hypotheses about what occasions and maintains the behavior, and collects observations to support the hypotheses. A few more-comprehensive ABA programs use multiple assessment and intervention methods individually and dynamically.|$|E
25|$|Critical to {{behavior}} analytic interventions {{is the concept}} of a systematic behavioral case formulation with a functional behavioral assessment or analysis at the core. This approach should apply a behavior analytic theory of change (see Behavioral change theories). This formulation should include a thorough functional assessment, a skills assessment, a sequential analysis (behavior chain analysis), an ecological assessment, a look at existing evidenced-based behavioral models for the <b>problem</b> <b>behavior</b> (such as Fordyce's model of chronic pain) and then a treatment plan based on how environmental factors influence behavior. Some argue that behavior analytic case formulation can be improved with an assessment of rules and rule-governed behavior. Some of the interventions that result from this type of conceptualization involve training specific communication skills to replace the problem behaviors as well as specific setting, antecedent, behavior, and consequence strategies.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Edward Carr {{published}} {{a paper on}} potential hypotheses for the occurrence and maintenance of self-injurious behaviors. This paper laid out the initial groundwork for a functional analysis of aberrant behaviors. In the paper, Carr described five potential causes for self-injurious behaviors that included (1) positive social reinforcement contingent on the response, (2) negative reinforcement {{in the form of}} removal of an aversive stimulus contingent on the response, (3) the response produced stimuli possessed reinforcing qualities (automatic reinforcement), (4) the behavior was a byproduct of an underlying psychological condition, and (5) psychodynamic hypothesis in which the behavior was an attempt to reduce guilt. Throughout the paper, Carr cited recent research to support the first three hypotheses, and disprove the latter two hypotheses, but no formal experiment was conducted to determine the controlling variables of the <b>problem</b> <b>behavior.</b>|$|E

40|$|Using {{caregiver}} identity theory, {{the authors}} investigated whether role discrepancies mediated {{the relationships between}} illness-related stressors (activities of daily living [ADLs] limitations and <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors)</b> and burden (stress, relationship, and objective burden) for spouse caregivers. Participants completed measures of identity standards for spouse and caregiver roles and behaviors, burden, assistance with ADLs, and <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that role discrepancies completely mediated the relationships between ADLs and stress and relationship burden. Although role discrepancies mediated the relationships between <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> and all forms of burden, there were direct relationships between <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> and burden. Finally, participants who exceeded their relationship identity standards experienced greater burden. Supporting caregiver identity theory, {{the results suggest that}} ADL assistance is burdensome for caregivers when it highlights inconsistencies between their behaviors and their relationship expectations. However, unpredictable stressors such as <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> are both inherently burdensome and highlight role discrepancies. 1 University of Wisconsin–Milwauke...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Caring for a {{loved one}} with Alzheimer disease is a highly {{stressful}} experience {{that is associated with}} significant depressive symptoms. Previous studies indicate a positive association between <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> in patients with Alzheimer disease (e. g., repeating questions, restlessness, and agitation) and depressive symptoms in their caregivers. Moreover, the extant literature indicates a robust negative relationship between escape-avoidance coping (i. e., avoiding people, wishing the situation would go away) and psychiatric well-being. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test a mediational model of the associations between patient <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors,</b> escape-avoidance coping, and depressive symptoms in Alzheimer caregivers. METHODS: Ninety-five spousal caregivers (mean age: 72 years) completed measures assessing their loved ones' frequency of <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors,</b> escape-avoidance coping, and depressive symptoms. A mediational model was tested to determine if escape-avoidant coping partially mediated the relationship between patient <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> and caregiver depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Patient <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> were positively associated with escape-avoidance coping (beta = 0. 38, p < 0. 01) and depressive symptoms (beta = 0. 26, p < 0. 05). Escape-avoidance coping was positively associated with depressive symptoms (beta = 0. 33, p < 0. 01). In a final regression analysis, the impact of <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> on depressive symptoms was less after controlling for escape-avoidance coping. Sobel's test confirmed that escape-avoidance coping significantly mediated the relationship between <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> and depressive symptoms (z = 2. 07, p < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Escape-avoidance coping partially mediates the association between patient <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> and depressive symptoms among elderly caregivers of spouses with dementia.

2500|$|A study {{performed}} at the University of Texas at Austin examined over 9,000 American adolescents to determine how their engagement in problematic behavior (such as stealing, fighting, and truancy) was related to their friendships. Findings indicated that adolescents {{were less likely to}} engage in <b>problem</b> <b>behavior</b> when their friends did well in school, participated in school activities, avoided drinking, and had good mental health.

2500|$|This method uses {{structured}} interviews, checklists, rating scales, or questionnaires {{to obtain}} information from persons {{who are familiar with}} the person exhibiting the behavior to identify possible conditions or events in the natural environment that correlate with the <b>problem</b> <b>behavior.</b> They are referred to as [...] "indirect" [...] because they do not involve direct observation of the behavior, but rather they solicit information based on others' recollections of the behavior. This form of assessment typically yields the least reliable information about the function of behavior, but can provide insight as to possible functions of the behavior to be tested in the future, the form of the behaviors (e.g. screaming, hitting, etc.), and environments in which the behavior typically occurs (e.g. school, home, etc.). This type of assessment should be performed as the initial step of any functional behavior assessment to gather relevant information to complete more direct assessments.|$|E

40|$|Objective—Ten early onset <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> {{were used}} to prospectively predict alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and cocaine {{disorders}} in young adulthood (mean age= 28. 6 yrs.) for a U.

Method—Data from a longitudinal study of participants who were recruited from high schools during adolescence and followed into young adulthood {{were used to}} evaluate prospective associations. The relationship between early onset <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors,</b> reported when participants were age 16 years, and psychiatric diagnoses assessed in young adulthood was tested. Structural equation models were used to evaluate both generality and specificity hypotheses regarding relationships between early onset <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> and young adult disorders. Results—Findings supported the specificity hypothesis in that “like ” early onset <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> significantly predicted “like ” young adult outcomes (e. g., early cocaine use predicted cocaine disorders). Furthermore, eliminating such “like ” predictors in regression equations resulted in a 36 % reduction {{in the amount of}} variance accounted for by the equation. The generality hypothesis was also supported in that a larger number of early onset <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> strengthened the prediction of young adult disorders beyond the “like ” attribute, and a dose-response pattern indicated that additional early onset <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> increased the probable occurrence of a young adult disorder. Conclusions—A comprehensive framework relating early onset <b>problem</b> <b>behaviors</b> to young adult substance disorders will require the integration of both generality and specificity hypotheses, and a developmental orientation focused on the unfolding of mediating and moderating processes.
