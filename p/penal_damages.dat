50|$|<b>Penal</b> <b>damages</b> {{are to be}} {{distinguished}} from punitive damages, which are awarded in certain types of tort actions for actions which caused harm to the plaintiff. <b>Penal</b> <b>damages</b> are also different from treble damages, which are generally set by statute for certain violations of competition law and related laws.|$|E
50|$|<b>Penal</b> <b>damages</b> are {{liquidated}} damages which exceed reasonable compensatory damages, making them invalid under common law. While liquidated damage clauses set a pre-agreed {{value on the}} expected loss to one party if the other party were to breach the contract, <b>penal</b> <b>damages</b> go further and seek to penalise the breaching party beyond the reasonable losses from the breach. Many clauses which {{are found to be}} penal are expressed as {{liquidated damages}} clauses but have been seen by courts as excessive and thus invalid.|$|E
50|$|A {{wholesale}} {{review of}} the English law rule against penalty clauses (as opposed to <b>penal</b> <b>damages)</b> was conducted by the UK Supreme Court in the 2015 judgment in Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi 2015 UKSC 67, a case joined with ParkingEye Ltd v Beavis {{for the purposes of}} the Supreme Court judgment.|$|E
5000|$|During {{his time}} as sheriff, Riser seemed {{repeatedly}} {{at odds with the}} Webster Parish Police Jury, the parish governing body akin to the county commission in most other states. The dispute centered over the housing and reimbursement of the costs of prisoners. Riser accused the police jury of not paying its bills after the jurors offered barely half of what the sheriff said was owed. The police jury, led by its president, Charles Roger [...] "Charlie" [...] Walker, Sr. (1931-2015) of Doyline, subsequently sued Riser, whom it accused of allowing his employees and inmate crews to sabotage the vacant parish <b>penal</b> farm; the <b>damages</b> rendered the facility inoperable for further use as a jail.Josh Beavers, former publisher of the Minden Press-Herald, said that Walker handled the controversy with Riser fairly: [...] "Through all of the turmoil, I never felt like Mr. Walker was trying to be subversive. He was always honest, always open." ...|$|R
40|$|Inside COBRA 2011 RICS International Research Conference, {{the present}} paper is linked to analyze the {{liability}} of the construction professional in his practice as a expert witness in the Spanish legal framework. In {{a large number of}} legal procedures related to the building it is necessary the intervention of the expert witness to report on the subject of litigation, and to give an opinion about possible causes and solutions. This field is increasingly importantly for the practice of construction professional that requires an important specialization. The expert provides his knowledge to the judge in the matter he is dealing with (construction, planning, assessment, legal, [...] .), providing arguments or reasons as the base for his case and acting as part of the evidence. Although the importance of expert intervention in the judicial process, the responsibilities arising from their activity is a slightly studied field. Therefore, the study has as purpose to think about the regulation of professional activities raising different aims. The first is to define the action of the construction professional-expert witness and the need for expert evidence, establishing the legal implications of this professional activity. The different types of responsibilities (the civil, criminal and administrative) have been established as well as the economic, <b>penal</b> or disciplinary <b>damages</b> that can be derived from the expert repor...|$|R
50|$|The {{judicial}} {{approach to}} <b>penal</b> <b>damages</b> is conceptually important {{as it is}} one of the few examples of judicial paternalism in contract law. Even if two parties genuinely and without coercion wish to consent to a contract which includes a penal clause, they are unable to. So, for example, a person wishing to give up smoking cannot contract with a third party to be fined $100 each time they smoke as this figure does not represent the expectation loss of the contract.|$|E
5000|$|Efficient breach {{theory is}} {{associated}} with Richard Posner and the Law and Economics school of thought. It {{has been used to}} defend the traditional common law rule that a non-tortious breach of contract cannot be remedied by punitive damages and <b>penal</b> <b>damages</b> (unreasonably excessive liquidated damages that are seen as a punishment for breach rather than a means to fairly compensate the other party). Such penalties would discourage efficient breach, and therefore [...] "efficient" [...] behavior, which would be undesirable for society as a whole. Posner explains his views in his majority opinion in Lake River Corp. v. Carborundum Co., 769 F.2d 1284 (7th Cir. 1985).|$|E
5000|$|Parties may {{contract}} for liquidated damages {{to be paid}} upon a breach of the contract {{by one of the}} parties. Under common law, a liquidated damages clause will not be enforced if the purpose of the term is solely to punish a breach (in this case it is termed <b>penal</b> <b>damages).</b> The clause will be enforceable if it involves a genuine attempt to quantify a loss in advance and is a good faith estimate of economic loss. Courts have ruled as excessive and invalidated damages which the parties contracted as liquidated, but which the court nonetheless found to be penal. To determine whether a clause is a liquidated damages clause or a penalty clause, it is necessary to consider: ...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{discusses}} {{a number}} of developments outside of the United States concerning punitive damages, which may ultimately signal {{a change in the}} way other countries view American awards of such damages. To date, courts in many countries have refused to recognize and enforce American punitive damages awards on the ground that they violate the host countryâ€™s public policy. In most civil law countries, such as France and Germany, <b>penal</b> <b>damages</b> can only be ordered in criminal proceedings; a civil award of such damages has been viewed as contrary to ordre public. In common law countries, while punitive damages generally may be awarded in civil suits, there is no agreement on the circumstances warranting punitive damages, and courts differ on the appropriate amount of such an award. While traditionally American awards of punitive damages have been difficult to enforce abroad, this practice may be about to change. Recently developments in France, Germany and the European Union, as well as decisions in Australia, Canada and Spain point toward greater receptivity to punitive damages and enforcement of foreign awards of these damages. In France, proposed revisions to the French Civil Code call for awarding punitive damages in certain cases. In Germany, a study by a prominent scholar finds that German courts are beginning to award <b>penal</b> <b>damages</b> in civil actions. In the European Union, a European Commission Green Paper raises the possibility of allowing the doubling of damages in certain antitrust cases. In Australia, a recent decision by the Supreme Court of South Australia opines that Australian courts would enforce large punitive damages awards ordered by American courts. Moreover, in Canada and Spain, appellate courts affirm decisions to enforce American judgments that included punitive damages. While these developments do not point toward clear sailing for American punitive damages abroad, when viewed together they may foreshadow a change in the wind that may ultimately lead to greater enforcement of these damages...|$|E
