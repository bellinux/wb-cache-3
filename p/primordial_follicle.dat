Locally produced growth factors are thought to be critical regulators of early follicle growth, but knowledge of their identity and source remains incomplete. Here, we have used a simple approach of spatial analysis of structures in histological tissue sections to identify likely sources of such regulatory molecules, narrowing the field for future screening for candidate growth factors or antagonists. We have quantified the relative spatial positions of <b>primordial</b> (resting) <b>follicles</b> and growing follicles in mice on days 4, 8, and 12 after birth, and calculated interfollicular distances. Follicles were significantly less likely to have started growing if they had 1 or more <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> close by (within 10 μm), predicting that <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> inhibit each other. This approach allows us to hypothesize that <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> produce a diffusible inhibitor that prevents neighboring <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> from growing.

40|$|Ovarian follicles are {{the basic}} {{functional}} units of the mammalian ovary. Progressive activation of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> serves {{as the source of}} fertilizable ova. In this thesis, by generating the Foxl 2 -CreERT 2 and Sohlh 1 -CreERT 2 mouse models, I have specifically labeled and traced the in vivo development of two classes of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles,</b> the first wave of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> that are activated immediately after they are formed and the adult <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> that are activated gradually in later life. The time-lapse tracing study has shown that the first wave of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> exist in the ovaries for about 3 months and contribute to the onset of puberty and to early fertility, whereas the adult <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> gradually replace the first wave and dominate the ovary after 3 months of age, providing fertility until the end of reproductive life. Moreover, the two follicle populations also exhibit diverged minimal and maximal in vivo ripening times. Thus the two classes of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> follow distinct, age-dependent developmental paths and play different roles in the mammalian reproductive lifespan. Next I have verified whether <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> can be regenerated from the purported female germline stem cells in the postnatal mouse ovary. We have created a multiple fluorescent Rosa 26 rbw/+;Ddx 4 -Cre germline reporter mouse model for in vivo and in vitro tracing the development of female germline cell lineage. Through live cell imaging and neo-folliculogenesis experiments, we have shown that the Ddx 4 -expressing cells from postnatal mouse ovaries do not divide during the in vitro culture, nor do they differentiate into oocytes following transplantation into the recipient mouse. Such experimental evidence supports the classic view that there is neither follicular replenishment nor female germline stem cell in the postnatal mammalian ovary. In summary, I have determined the developmental dynamics of two distinct populations of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> in the mouse ovary and confirmed that there is no spontaneous follicle regeneration. Such knowledge will hopefully lead to a more in-depth understanding of how different types of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> contribute to physiological and pathological alterations of the mammalian ovary...|$|R
50|$|<b>Primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> {{initiation}} {{and development}} varies by species; in the canine <b>primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> formation occurs 17-54 days post birth.

The follicles begin to proliferate, and are abundant by day 22. Even though primordial follicles will continue to form, between days 33 and 54 increasing numbers begin to degenerate, along with a decrease in ovarian cortical width.

40|$|To {{maintain}} the female reproductive lifespan, {{the majority of}} ovarian <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> are preserved in a quiescent state {{in order to provide}} ova for later reproductive life. However, the molecular mechanism that maintains the long quiescence of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> is poorly understood. Here we provide genetic evidence to show that the tumor suppressor tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc 1), which negatively regulates mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC 1), functions in oocytes to {{maintain the}} quiescence of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles.</b> In mutant mice lacking the Tsc 1 gene in oocytes, the entire pool of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> is activated prematurely due to elevated mTORC 1 activity in the oocyte, ending up with follicular depletion in early adulthood and causing premature ovarian failure (POF). We further show that maintenance of the quiescence of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> requires synergistic, collaborative functioning of both Tsc and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) and that these two molecules suppress follicular activation through distinct ways. Our results suggest that Tsc/mTORC 1 signaling and PTEN/PI 3 K (phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase) signaling synergistically regulate the dormancy and activation of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles,</b> and together ensure the proper length of female reproductive life.

Double-strand breaks are accurately repaired during meiosis by searching for, and building off of, the matching strand (termed “homologous recombinational repair”). Titus et al. (2013) found that, as humans (and mice) age, expression of four key DNA repair genes necessary for homologous recombinational repair declines in oocytes.

Nevertheless, it is possible to let a <b>primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> mature to a secondary follicle outside the body by growing it in a slice of ovarian tissue.

50|$|After {{migration}} primordial {{germ cells}} will become oogonia in the forming gonad (ovary). The oogonia proliferate extensively by mitotic divisions, up to 5-7 million cells in humans. But then {{many of these}} oogonia die and about 50,000 remain. These cells differentiate into primary oocytes. In week 11-12 post coitus the first meiotic division begins (before birth for most mammals) and remains arrested in prophase I from {{a few days to}} many years depending on the species. It is in this period or in some cases at the beginning of sexual maturity that the primary oocytes secrete proteins to form a coat called zona pellucida and they also produce cortical granules containing enzymes and proteins needed for fertilization. Meiosis stands by because of the follicular granulosa cells that send inhibitory signals through gap junctions and the zona pellucida. Sexual maturation is the beginning of periodic ovulation. Ovulation is the regular release of one oocyte from the ovary into the reproductive tract and is preceded by follicular growth. A few follicle cells are stimulated to grow but only one oocyte is ovulated. A <b>primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> consists of an epithelial layer of follicular granulosa cells enclosing an oocyte. The pituitary gland secrete follicle-stimulating hormones (FSHs) that stimulate follicular growth and oocyte maturation. The thecal cells around each follicle secrete estrogen. This hormone stimulates the production of FSH receptors on the follicular granulosa cells and has {{at the same time a}} negative feedback on FSH secretion. This results in a competition between the follicles and only the follicle with the most FSH receptors survives and is ovulated. Meiotic division I goes on in the ovulated oocyte stimulated by luteinizing hormones (LHs) produced by the pituitary gland. FSH and LH block the gap junctions between follicle cells and the oocyte therefore inhibiting communication between them. Most follicular granulosa cells stay around the oocyte and so form the cumulus layer. Large non-mammalian oocytes accumulate egg yolk, glycogen, lipids, ribosomes, and the mRNA needed for protein synthesis during early embryonic growth. These intensive RNA biosynthese are mirrored in the structure of the chromosomes, which decondense and form lateral loops giving them a lampbrush appearance (see Lampbrush chromosome). Oocyte maturation is the following phase of oocyte development. It occurs at sexual maturity when hormones stimulate the oocyte to complete meiotic division I. The meiotic division I produces 2 cells differing in size: a small polar body and a large secondary oocyte. The secondary oocyte undergoes meiotic division II and that results in the formation of a second small polar body and a large mature egg, both being haploid cells. The polar bodies degenerate. Oocyte maturation stands by at metaphase II in most vertebrates. During ovulation, the arrested secondary oocyte leaves the ovary and matures rapidly into an egg ready for fertilization. Fertilization will cause the egg to complete meiosis II. In human females there is proliferation of the oogonia in the fetus, meiosis starts then before birth and stands by at meiotic division I up to 50 years, ovulation begins at puberty.|$|E

Recent genetic studies have demonstrated that phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) is the essential signaling pathway controlling this process throughout life, acting via Akt to regulate nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Foxo 3, which functions as a downstream molecular switch.

In single sections (5 Im thick), <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> had a mean ratio of maximum to minimum diameters of 1. 33 ± 0. 18 (mean SD; n = 317, randomly selected), indicating {{that they had a}} prolate rather than a spherical shape. The prolate shape was attributable to clustering of granulosa cells at two opposite poles on the long axis of each follicle; and in each histological section, 82. 5 % of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> (n = 317) had at least one cuboidal granu-losa cell. More accurate measurements of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> indicated that they had three dimensions measured as length (45. 4 ± 2. 4 gim), breadth (26. 8 1. 5 pIm), and depth (< 30. 4 ± 1. 4 jtm) (mean ± SEM; n = 12, constructed from serial sec-tions); a surface area of 0. 0032 mm 2; and 24 ± 2 granulosa cells. The ultrastructural morphology of the cells of the bovine pri-mordial follicle (n = 31 examined by electron microscopy) was similar to that of other species. The ovarian cortex was com-posed of discrete zones. The zones containing primordial folli-cles were substantially avascular, as observed by localizing von Willebrand factor, and rich in collagen fibrils. In conclusion, since <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> of bovine ovaries contain some cuboi-dal pre-granulosa cells, changes in shape cannot be used with certainty as a marker of activation of bovine follicles...|$|R
40|$|Trp 63, a {{transcription}} factor {{related to the}} tumor suppressor p 53, is activated by diverse stimuli and can initiate a range of cellular responses. TAp 63 is the predominant Trp 53 family member in <b>primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> oocyte nuclei and is essential for their apoptosis triggered by DNA damage in vivo. After γ-irradiation, induction of the proapoptotic BH 3 -only members Puma and Noxa was observed in <b>primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> oocytes from WT and Trp 53 (-/-) mice but not in those from TAp 63 -deficient mice. <b>Primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> oocytes from mice lacking Puma or both Puma and Noxa were protected from γ-irradiation-induced apoptosis and, remarkably, could produce healthy offspring. Hence, PUMA and NOXA are critical for DNA damage-induced, TAp 63 -mediated <b>primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> oocyte apoptosis. Thus, blockade of PUMA may protect fertility during cancer therapy and prevent premature menopause, improving women's health...|$|E
40|$|The murine <b>primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> pool {{develops}} largely within 3 {{days after}} birth through germline nest breakdown and enclosure of oocytes within pregranulosa cells. The mechanisms that trigger <b>primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> formation likely {{are influenced by}} a transition from the maternal to fetal hormonal milieu {{at the time of}} birth. High levels of maternal estrogen maintain intact germline nest in fetal ovary, and decrease of estrogen after birth is permissive of follicle formation. In the present study, we measured an increase in neonatal serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which corresponded to falling estradiol (E 2) levels during the critical window of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> formation (Postnatal Days 1 – 3). To determine whether fetal hormones contribute in an active manner to <b>primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> formation, mouse fetal ovaries (17. 5 days postcoitus) were cultured in vitro at two concentrations of E 2 (meant to reflect maternal and fetal levels of E 2) and FSH for 6 days. High levels of E 2 (10 − 6 M) inhibited germline nest breakdown, and this effect was significantly reduced when fetal ovaries were cultured in the low E 2 concentration (10 − 10 M). FSH facilitated germline nest breakdown and <b>primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> formation under both high and low E 2 culture conditions. Low E 2 was identified as being more permissive for the effects of FSH on <b>primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> formation by stimulating the up-regulation of Fshr and activin betaA subunit (Inhba) expression, pregranulosa cell proliferation, and oocyte survival. The decrease of E 2 plus the presence of FSH after birth are critical for <b>primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> formation and the expression of oocyte-specific transcription factors (Figla and Nobox) in that inappropriate exposure to FSH or E 2 during follicle formation resulted in premature or delayed primordial folliculogenesis. In conclusion, with the drop of E 2 level after birth, FSH promotes <b>primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> formation in mice by stimulating local activin signaling pathways and the expression of oocyte-specific transcription factors...|$|E
40|$|Background: The Hippo {{signaling}} pathway, {{a highly}} conserved cell signaling system, exists in most multicellular organisms and regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It {{has been reported}} that the members of Hippo signaling are expressed in mammalian ovaries, but the exact functions of this pathway in <b>primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> development remains unclear. Methods: To analyze the spatio-temporal correlation between the core component of Hippo pathway and the size of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> pool, Western blot, Real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry were used, and the expression and localization of MST 1, LATS 2 and YAP 1 mRNA and protein were examined in 3 d, 1 m, 5 m, 16 m postnatal mice ovary and the culture model of mice <b>primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> in vitro. Results: Both the protein and mRNA expression of the MST 1 and LATS 2 were decreased significantly as mouse age increased (p in vitro resulted in the activation of primordial follicles in 3 d postnatal mice ovaries, and these developed into primary follicles with the expression of PCNA increasing significantly (p Conclusion: The above results reveal that the expression of the core components of Hippo pathway changed during mouse follicular development, especially before and after <b>primordial</b> <b>follicle</b> activation in vitro.

40|$|The {{freezing}} {{of ovarian}} tissue {{and the growth}} of immature oocytes from <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> is an interesting concept in ovarian tissue transplantation and in-vitro fertilization. In this study, the morphology and distribution of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> were studied in ovarian tissue from 24 women before and after cryopreservation. Cryopreservation did not significantly change either the morphology or number per unit volume of morphologically normal follicles in frozen ovarian tissue. <b>Primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> were predominant, accounting for 78. 6 % and 82. 6 % of total follicles in fresh and frozen ovarian tissues respectively. The distribution of follicles was extremely uneven in ovarian tissue. A large variation in follicle numbers was observed in ovarian tissue samples from patient to patient, and even in the same patient, indicating that the number of follicles counted in one sample of ovarian tissue may not represent the number of follicles in other tissue samples. Ovarian tissue could be frozen in the form of strips instead of fragments for fast processing and better viability of ovarian tissue in cryopreservation. The number of follicles in ovarian tissue declined with the increasing age of the patients. An immunohistochemical study showed that immunoreactivity for the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor was detected in <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> of adult ovarian tissue. EGF receptor staining was most intense in the oocytes of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles.</b> Weak staining for EGF receptor was observed in some surrounding pregranulosa cells. Immunohistochemical staining for EGF receptor was also present in the stromal cells of ovarian tissue, but to a much lesser degree.

40|$|A {{system of}} 16 nonlinear, delay {{differential}} equations with 66 parameters is developed to model hormonal {{regulation of the}} menstrual cycle of a woman from age 20 to age 51. This mechanistic model predicts changes in follicle numbers and reproductive hormones that naturally occur over that time span. In particular, the model illustrates {{the decline in the}} pool of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> from age 20 to menopause as reported in the biological literature. Also, model simulations exhibit a decrease in antimüllerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin B and an increase in FSH with age corresponding to experimental data. Model simulations using the administration of exogenous AMH show that the transfer of non-growing <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> to the active state can be slowed enough to provide more follicles for development later in life and to cause a delay in the onset of menopause as measured by the number of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> remaining in the ovaries.

40|$|Background: Nandrolone {{decanoate}} (ND) is an {{anabolic androgenic steroid}} (AAS) which {{influences the}} ovarian structure and function. We assessed the effects of ND on the ovarian volume, number of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles,</b> and level of hormones and also evaluated the modulatory effects of gonadotropins on the histopathological changes imposed by the administration of ND. Methods: Six groups of Sprague-Dawley adult female rats (n= 30) were used. The experimental rats were injected intraperitoneally with 3 and 10 mg/kg ND with or without human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), 10 IU weekly for one month. The vehicle and control rats were administered olive oil and saline, respectively, {{for the same period}} of time. The ovarian volume and number of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> were estimated by stereological methods. Results: The results showed a decrease in the ovarian volume, number of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles,</b> and level of gonadotropins in the ND-treated animals compared with the vehicle groups. In the rats treated with 3 mg/kg of ND with hMG, an increase in the ovarian volume and number of <b>primordial</b> <b>follicles</b> was shown as compared to the rats treated with the same dose of ND without hMG. Conclusion: ND exerted detrimental effects on the dimensions of the ovary, number of follicles, and level of sex hormones. However, hMG, prevented the harmful effects of ND (at least in a low dose) on the ovarian follicles...|$|R
