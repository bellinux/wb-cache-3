He moved in 1710 to Bath, {{where he became}} a <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>clerk,</b> and {{at the age of}} 19, in 1712, became the Postmaster. In 1742 he was elected Mayor of Bath, and was the Member of Parliament for Bath between 1757 and 1764.

5|$|In July 1889, Police Constable Luke Hanks was {{investigating}} a theft from the London Central Telegraph Office. During the investigation, a fifteen-year-old telegraph boy named Charles Thomas Swinscow was discovered {{to be in}} possession of fourteen shillings, equivalent to several weeks of his wages. At the time, messenger boys were not permitted to carry any personal cash {{in the course of}} their duties, to prevent their own money being mixed with that of the customers. Suspecting the boy's involvement in the theft, Constable Hanks brought him in for questioning. After hesitating, Swinscow admitted that he earned the money working as a prostitute for a man named Charles Hammond, who operated a male brothel at 19 Cleveland Street. According to Swinscow, he was introduced to Hammond by a General <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>clerk,</b> eighteen-year-old Henry Newlove. In addition, he named two seventeen-year-old telegraph boys who also worked for Hammond: George Alma Wright and Charles Ernest Thickbroom. Constable Hanks obtained corroborating statements from Wright and Thickbroom and, armed with these, a confession from Newlove.|$|E

Dalton, authorised printers Joseph Baum and William Dallas, {{who were the}} publishers of the Official Gazette newspaper in Georgetown, to print an emergency issue of three stamps. Dalton gave some specifications about the design, but the printer chose to add a ship image of their own design to stamps. Dalton was not pleased with the end result, and as a safeguard against forgery ordered that all correspondence bearing the stamps be autographed by a <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>clerk.</b> This particular stamp was initialled E.D.W. by the clerk E.D.

50|$|Two {{organizations}} of postal clerks {{emerged in the}} 1890s; they merged in 1899 into the United National Association of <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Clerks</b> (UNAPOC). It was too conservative for the AFL, which in 1906 sponsored the National Federation of <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Clerks</b> (NFPOC), which soon surpassed the UNAPOC. NFPOC grew from 16,000 members in 1922 36,000 in 1932, and nearly 50,000 by 1940. It did not engage in strikes, but spent much of its efforts in opposing hostile Congressional legislation. Additional rivals were formed in the 1930s but the first serious rival was the National Postal Clerks Union (NPCU) that began in 1958 and by 1970 reach the membership of 80,000. Merger discussions dragged on for years, until the NFPOC, UNMAPOC and others merged in 1961 as the United Federation of Postal Clerks.

40|$|TESSA is an {{experimental}} system {{that aims to}} aid transactions between a deaf person and a <b>clerk</b> in a <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> by translating the clerk’s speech to sign language. A speech recogniser recognises speech from the clerk and the system then synthesizes the appropriate sequence of signs in British Sign language (BSL) using a speciallydeveloped avatar.

40|$|A {{prototype}} {{speech to}} signing system (TESSA) has been constructed to aid communication of <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>clerks</b> with deaf customers. The system recognizes about 150 different phrases relevant to transactions in a <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> and translates them into sign language. Signing is performed by an avatar using motion-captured signs made by signers from the UK Royal National Institute for the Deaf (RNID). The system incorporates recognition of simple systematic variation within some phrases e. g. {{amounts of money}} or {{days of the week}} are recognised at appropriate places in the phrase. Provision has been made to automatically adapt the speech recogniser to the voices of different assistants and for the rapid addition of new words and phrases to the lexicon. The phrases may also be translated into other spoken languages including English, French, German, Welsh and Somali. The system has been formally evaluated by the RNID...|$|R

60|$|Though {{it never}} once {{mentioned}} the grand title it made allusions which {{implied that the}} real rank of the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>clerk</b> was well known to every one at Castle Hautboy. And though nothing of course was said as to any possible relations between Lord Persiflage {{as a member of}} the British Cabinet and the clerk's uncle {{as a member of the}} Italian Cabinet, nevertheless as to this also there were allusions which were intelligible. This letter was altogether very gracious,--such a one as few young men would be able to resist coming from such a person as Lady Persiflage. But the special offer which prevailed with our <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>clerk</b> was no doubt the promise of the presence of Fanny Trafford. In all the rest, gracious as the words were, there was nothing but trouble for him. It was clear enough to him that Lady Persiflage was on the same side as Crocker. Lady Persiflage would no doubt prefer a Duca di Crinola to a <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>clerk</b> for Lady Frances. And he could see also that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was on the same side. The Secretary of State would not have expressed a special desire to see him, the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>clerk,</b> at Castle Hautboy, and have, as it were, welcomed him to the possession of his brother-in-law's daughter, had nothing been told of the Duca di Crinola. He heard as much from Lord Hampstead, who advised him to go to Castle Hautboy, and make himself acquainted with Fanny's family friends. It was all manifest. And as it was all being done in opposition to his own firm resolution, he would not have gone,--but that the temptation was too great for him. Fanny Trafford would be there,--and he was quite open to the charm of the offer which was almost being made to him of Lady Fanny's hand. He arranged the matter at the office, and wrote to Lady Persiflage accepting the invitation.|$|E

In his gait and form and face nothing was discernibly more appropriate to <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>clerks</b> than to the nobility at large.

40|$|Abstract. In {{contrast}} to press censorship, books published in Estado Novo Portugal were {{not subject to}} a priori censorship, but rather post-publication censorship. Additionally, imported books along with other publications were rigorously examined by custom officials, and private mailing of certain individuals was also monitored by <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>clerks.</b> Theoretically, no foreign book could easily enter the country without official inspection. Based on the censorship reports, it seems, however, {{that the degree of}} censorship was often fluctuating and uneven. The varying rigor, for the most part, can be put down to historical and political factors such as wars and other domestic conflicts, but there were indeed other types of inconsistencies. Through an exhaustive analysis of selected case studies, the paper also provides detailed insights into the mechanisms of censorship that operated in Salazar-Caetano regime Portugal...|$|R

When the number of {{new students}} was greater than the number of vacancies available at the school, the GIS application suggested the nearest school with remaining vacancies...|$|R
60|$|But {{then there}} were other reasons why she should not wish it to be true. In the first place she hated them both. Let the man be Duca di Crinola {{as much as he}} might, he would still have been a <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>clerk,</b> and Lady Frances would have {{admitted}} his courtship having believed him at the time to have been no more than a <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>clerk.</b> The sin would have been not the less abominable in the choice of her lover, although it might be expedient that the sin should be forgiven. And then the girl had insulted her, and there had been that between them which would prevent the possibility of future love; and would it not be hard upon her darlings if it should become necessary to carve out from the family property a permanent income for this Italian nobleman, and for a generation of Italian noblemen to come; and then what a triumph would this be for Hampstead, who, of all human beings, was the most distasteful to her.|$|E

Am I right in supposing that I have been accepted here by you in that light?" [...] This was a question which the Marquis was not prepared to answer at the moment. No doubt the young man had been accepted. Lady Frances had been allowed to go down to Castle Hautboy to meet him as her lover. All the family had been collected to welcome him at the London mansion. The newspapers had been full of mysterious paragraphs in which the future happy bridegroom was sometimes spoken of as an Italian Duke and sometimes as an English <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>clerk.</b> [...] "Of course he must marry her now," [...] the Marquis had said to his wife, with much anger. [...] "It's all your sister's doings," [...] he had said to her again. He had in a soft moment given his affectionate blessing to his daughter in special reference to her engagement. He knew that he couldn't go back from it now, and had it been possible, would have been most unwilling to give his wife such a triumph.
