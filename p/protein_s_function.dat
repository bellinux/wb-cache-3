40|$|RIFIN {{proteins}} are variable surface antigens, {{which have}} {{a central role in}} the survival and virulence of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Antigenic variation is a mean for these parasites to avoid clearance by the host s immune system. However, this is often a secondary function to the main role of these proteins. In the case of RIFIN, P. falciparum s largest multicopy protein family, the main functions remain unknown. In order to elucidate a <b>protein</b> <b>s</b> <b>function,</b> it is crucial to understand its basic properties, including the structure of the protein family, their localization and the protein s topology. Through different methods, we have strived to simplify the RIFIN protein family into manageable entities. We have started with a simple classification of RIFIN proteins into meaningful sub-groups. We have predicted that these sub-groups are functionally distinct, although they probably share a related function. We then designed RSPred, an automatic method, based on hidden Markov models and a sorting program, to detect and classify RIFIN and STEVOR sequences according to their sub-group. Finally, using an in vitro method to determine protein topology, we have analyzed both A-RIFIN and B-RIFIN proteins for their number of transmembrane segments and their topologies. We show that both protein groups have a signal sequence targeting them to lipid bilayers and only one transmembrane domain. They both share a common topology where the bulk of the protein is exposed to the extracellular environment. With the current knowledge of RIFIN protein localizations, as well as the loss of expression of A-RIFIN but not B-RIFIN proteins in a splenectomized patient, it seems increasingly clear that B-RIFIN proteins are good targets for future studies, to decipher the functions of these variable proteins...|$|E

40|$|Thrombin activatable {{fibrinolysis}} inhibitor (TAFI) is a carboxy-peptidase B-like proenzyme {{that after}} activation by thrombin downregulates fibrinolysis. Thrombomodulin stimulates the activation of both TAFI and protein C whereas activated protein C inhibits the activation of TAFI by downregulation of thrombin formation, {{a process in}} which <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> acts as a cofactor. Here we determined the role of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> in the activation of TAFI and regulation of fibrinolysis. Depletion of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> from plasma or inhibition of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> by specific antibodies resulted in an increased rate of TAFI activation and in an increased maximum of TAFIa activity generated. The effect on the rate of TAFI activation could be attributed to the APC-independent anticoagulant <b>function</b> of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> whereas the effect on the maximum activity could be attributed to the APC cofactor <b>function</b> of <b>protein</b> <b>S.</b> Therefore it is concluded that <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> inhibits TAFI activation in two ways.

Inherited deficiency of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> constitutes {{a risk factor for}} venous thromboembolism. <b>Protein</b> <b>S</b> <b>functions</b> as a nonenzymatic cofactor for activated protein C in the proteolytic degradation of coagulation factors a and a. The frequency of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> deficiency seems to differ between populations. More than 200 rare mutations in PROS 1 have been identified in patients with <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> deficiency. Among the prevalent mutations within PROS 1, the S 460 P substitution (known as Heerlen polymorphism) detected in Caucasians and the K 196 E substitution (known as <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> Tokushima) found in Japanese have been intensively studied for their structures and potential functions in the disorder of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> deficiency. Until now, causative mutations in PROS 1 have been found in only approximately 50 % of cases with <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> deficiency. Co-segregation analysis of microsatellite haplotypes with <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> deficiency in families with <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> deficiency suggests that the causative defects in the PROS 1 mutation-negative patients are located in or close to the PROS 1 gene. Large PROS 1 gene deletions have been identified in 3 out of 9 PROS 1 mutation-negative Swedish VTE families with <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> deficiency and 1 out of 6 PROS 1 mutation-negative Japanese patients with <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> deficiency.

40|$|Procoagulant factors, which {{activate}} platelets and initiate blood coagulation, {{are exposed}} upon vascular damage. (1, 2) In {{a series of}} sequential proteolytic reactions, proenzymes are activated, culminating {{in the formation of}} thrombin. Several of the reactions are greatly enhanced by non-enzymatic cofactors, which together with the enzymes are assembled into highly efficient and specific proteolytic complexes on the surface of procoagulant phospholipids. (3) The protein C anticoagulant pathway regulates the activity of the procoagulant cofactors, factor Va (FVa) and factor VIIIa (FVIIIa).

J. 1989. J. Biol. Chem. 264 : 17645 - 17658). A synthetic peptide, GVQLDLDEAI, corresponding to that region of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> has been used to investigate the protein S/C 4 b-binding protein interaction in vitro and in vivo. Rabbit activated protein C possesses species-specific anticoagulant activity for which rabbit <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> <b>functions</b> as a cofactor. In plasma, rabbit <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> is found in complex with C 4 b-binding protein. GVQLDLDEAI can inhibit this interaction, resulting in enhancement of the anticoagulant activity of rabbit activated protein C. The effect of the peptide can be blocked by the concurrent addition of human or rabbit C 4 b-binding protein. When infused into rabbits, GVQLDLDEAI was cleared from the circulation with a half-life of 80 min. This is significantly less rapid than the clearance of similarly sized control peptides (half-life of 15 min), but much more than that of bovine <b>protein</b> <b>S,</b> a much larger protein (half-life of 15 h).

40|$|<b>Protein</b> <b>S</b> has an {{established}} {{role in the}} protein C anticoagulant pathway as a cofactor for anticoagulant protein C (APC) and has also recently been shown {{to serve as a}} cofactor enhancing the anticoagulant activity of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). Despite its physiological role and clinical importance, the molecular bases of its functions are not fully understood. The aim of my thesis was to clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in the <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> interaction with APC and TFPI. More than 30 point or composite <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> variants were constructed and analysed during this project. These variants spanned the Gla, thrombin sensitive region (TSR), epidermal growth-factor 1 (EGF 1) and EGF 2 domains of <b>protein</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Protein</b> <b>S</b> was expressed in mammalian cells and was purified by chromatography, as required. <b>Protein</b> <b>S</b> was characterised by size, cleavage, multimerisation, γ-carboxylation of the Gla domain, binding to phospholipids and to domain specific monoclonal antibodies. Variants were evaluated for their APC and TFPI cofactor activities both by calibrated automated thrombography and in purified FVa inactivation or FXa inhibition assays, respectively. The <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> variant, <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> D 95 A, with substitution in EGF 1 was found to be largely devoid of functional APC cofactor activity and I believe that this residue {{plays an important role in}} <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> anticoagulant <b>function.</b> It was γ- carboxylated and bound phospholipids and domain specific monoclonal antibodies with an apparent dissociation constant similar to that of wild type <b>protein</b> <b>S.</b> Importantly, <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> D 95 A enhanced the anticoagulant activity of TFPI, suggesting that distinct residues in <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> mediate its APC and TFPI cofactor activity. Two composite mutants in the <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> EGF 1 domain had partially reduced TFPI cofactor activity in plasma. However, none of the more than 30 variants spanning the Gla-TSR-EGF 1 -EGF 2 domain of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> completely disrupted the <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> cofactor activity towards TFPI.

40|$|<b>Protein</b> <b>S</b> <b>functions</b> as a {{cofactor}} to activated protein C (APC) in {{the degradation}} of factors Va and VIIIa. In plasma <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> circulates in two forms; 30 - 40 % circulates as free <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> molecules while the remaining 60 - 70 % exists in a 1 : 1 complex with C 4 b-binding protein (C 4 BP). Only the free form of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> <b>functions</b> as a cofactor to APC. <b>Protein</b> <b>S</b> is a mosaic protein composed of four discrete modules; a g-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) -containing module, a thrombin-sensitive module (TSR), four epidermal growth factor (EGF) -like modules and a C-terminal sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) -like module. The Gla-module contains 11 Gla residues, which require vitamin K for their biosynthesis, and anchors the protein to the membrane. All four EGF-like modules contain another modified amino acid residue, erythro-b-hydroxyaspartic acid (Hya) or erythro-b-hyroxyasparagine (Hyn). The three C-terminal modules also contain a concensus sequence indicating Ca 2 + binding. The C-terminal SHBG-like module contains the binding site for C 4 BP. The aim of this work has been to study the Ca 2 + binding affinity of the EGF-like modules, and the involvement of these modules in interactions with other proteins. Fragments containing one, two, three or four EGF-like modules have been isolated. This includes the chemically synthesized single EGF modules 3 and 4. These two modules were also expressed as a pair in a procaryotic system and folded to a native conformation. EGF 1 - 4, EGF 1 - 3, EGF 2 - 3 and EGF 2 - 4 were expressed in a baculovirus based insect cell system. The Ca 2 + affinity in the modules was determined either by NMR monitored titrations or using chromophoric chelators. We found that the single modules EGF 3 and 4 bound Ca 2 + in the low mM range (Kd 6 - 9 mM). In the EGF 3 - 4 pair the N-terminal site binds Ca 2 + with an affinity that is almost identical to that of free module 3, whereas the affinity of the C-terminal module is greatly enhanced. Compared to the single module the affinity is ~ 8600 -fold higher for EGF 4 in the pair. It thus appears as if the major effect on Ca 2 + binding is excerted by the module N-terminal of the Ca 2 + binding one. EGF modules 1 - 4 and 2 - 4 each was found to contain two very high affinity Ca 2 + binding sites; with Kd from 10 - 8 to 10 - 6 M, at physiological ionic strength. In contrast, the Ca 2 + affinities of EGF 2 - 3 and EGF 1 - 3 is two to four orders of magnitude lower. These data imply that also modules C-terminal of the Ca 2 + binding one influence the Ca 2 + affinity. By using the recombinant EGF modules as inhibitors in a clotting assay, it was shown that the interaction between <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> and APC was mediated by recombinant fragments which contained the first EGF module (EGF 1 - 4 and EGF 1 - 3). Yet, EGF 1 - 4 had an almost 10 -fold stronger inhibitory effect than EGF 1 - 3 for reasons that not yet understood. Using a solid-phase system a direct interaction between <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> and factor Xa was also observed.

40|$|<b>Protein</b> <b>S</b> <b>functions</b> as a {{cofactor}} for {{tissue factor}} pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and activated protein C (APC). The sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) -like region of <b>protein</b> <b>S,</b> {{consisting of two}} laminin G-like domains (LG 1 and LG 2), contains the binding site for C 4 b-binding protein (C 4 BP) and TFPI. Furthermore, the LG-domains are essential for the TFPI-cofactor function and for expression of full APC-cofactor function. The aim {{of the current study}} was to localise functionally important interaction sites in the <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> LG-domains using amino acid substitutions. Four <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> variants were created in which clusters of surface-exposed amino acid residues within the LG-domains were substituted. All variants bound normally to C 4 BP and were fully functional as cofactors for APC in plasma and in pure component assays. Two variants, SHBG 2 (E 612 A, I 614 A, F 265 A, V 393 A, H 453 A), involving residues from both LG-domains, and SHBG 3 (K 317 A, I 330 A, V 336 A, D 365 A) where residues in LG 1 were substituted, showed 50 – 60 [*]% reduction in enhancement of TFPI in FXa inhibition assays. For SHBG 3 the decreased TFPI cofactor function was confirmed in plasma based thrombin generation assays. Both SHBG variants bound to TFPI with decreased affinity in surface plasmon resonance experiments. The TFPI Kunitz 3 domain is known to contain the interaction site for <b>protein</b> <b>S.</b> Using in silico analysis and protein docking exercises, preliminary models of the <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> SHBG/TFPI Kunitz domain 3 complex were created.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on four {{projects}} with the overall aim to investigate vitamin K-dependent <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> <b>functions</b> in relation to its structure. The anticoagulant <b>functions</b> of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> can be divided in three: 1) cofactor for activated protein C (APC), 2) cofactor for tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and 3) APC and TFPI-independent anticoagulant functions. Microparticles might be shed from any cell type, and elevated levels of circulating microparticles are associated with several diseases ranging from thrombotic disorders, cancer, diabetes, autoimmune conditions and sickle cell disease. Platelet-derived microparticles are part of normal haemostasis, assisting in efficient formation of a blood clot {{at the site of}} vascular injury. However in circulation, the procoagulant microparticles are potential initiators of undesirable thrombus formation. <b>Protein</b> <b>S</b> has been shown to bind microparticles, and we therefore studied the function of the anticoagulant APC-system on the surface of platelet- and erythrocyte-derived microparticles. We could confirm binding of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> to the microparticles. The bound <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> supported APC in regulation of coagulation, both in purified systems and in plasma, suggesting the APC-mediated regulation of coagulation to be highly effective on the surface of microparticles. The high concentration of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> in circulation might therefore counteract the procoagulant properties of microparticles. The TFPI-cofactor <b>function</b> of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> was quite recently described, <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> stimulating TFPI-mediated regulation of the initiation of coagulation, {{in a manner that is}} dependent on direct interaction between <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> and TFPI. In an attempt to localize the interaction site on <b>protein</b> <b>S,</b> we created four <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> variants and tested them for TFPI-cofactor function. We found two variants with impaired function and could therefore suggest a region in the most C-terminal domain of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> to be of importance. Furthermore, in silico experiments were performed and possible poses of interaction between <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> and TFPI were proposed. Only 30 - 40 % of the circulating <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> has full anticoagulant function, the rest is bound to the complement regulator C 4 b-binding protein (C 4 BP). <b>Protein</b> <b>S</b> interacts with C 4 BP in an affinity so high that all C 4 BP in circulation carry a <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> molecule. In a previous study, it was shown that patients with <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> deficiency, undergoing treatment that further decreases the <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> production, also had decreased concentration of C 4 BP. By the use of recombinant protein expression we could see that <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> and C 4 BP need to be produced in the same cell, at the same time for efficient secretion of C 4 BP.

50|$|<b>Protein</b> <b>S</b> {{can bind to}} {{negatively}} charged phospholipids via the carboxylated Gla domain. This property allows <b>Protein</b> <b>S</b> to <b>function</b> in the removal of cells which are undergoing apoptosis. Apoptosis {{is a form of}} cell death that is used by the body to remove unwanted or damaged cells from tissues. Cells, which are apoptotic (i.e. in the process of apoptosis), no longer actively manage the distribution of phospholipids in their outer membrane and hence begin to display {{negatively charged}} phospholipids, such as phosphatidyl serine, on the cell surface. In healthy cells, an ATP (Adenosine triphosphate)-dependent enzyme removes these from the outer leaflet of the cell membrane. These negatively charged phospholipids are recognized by phagocytes such as macrophages. <b>Protein</b> <b>S</b> can bind to the negatively charged phospholipids and function as a bridging molecule between the apoptotic cell and the phagocyte. The bridging property of <b>Protein</b> <b>S</b> enhances the phagocytosis of the apoptotic cell, allowing it to be removed 'cleanly' without any symptoms of tissue damage such as inflammation occurring.|$|R
40|$|<b>Protein</b> <b>S</b> {{deficiency}} is an {{autosomal dominant}} trait affecting around 10 % of families thrombophilic families. The high affinity interaction of approximately 60 % of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> with C 4 b -binding protein (C 4 BP) has raised a complicated {{situation for the}} diagnosis of deficiency states. Because only free <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> <b>functions</b> as cofactor in the protein C anticoagulant, {{it is important to}} measure free <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> level precisely. In this study a free <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> assay was developed using its natural ligand C 4 BP to capture free <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> from plasma for routine clinical purpose. Although interference by C 4 BP is so far considered as the major hindrance for developing ELISA, the new approach has utilized this phenomenon of high affinity interaction between <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> and C 4 BP, thereby reversing the adverse effect of C 4 BP to one of good use. (1) Mutations in a variety of human genes are now known to predispose to venous thrombosis. Characterization of the wide spectrum of gene mutations causing thrombosis may allow us to relate specific gene lesions to the probability of thromboembolism {{as well as to the}} severity of thrombotic episodes, beside providing the molecular mechanism of deficiency states. To establish the relationship between genetic abnormalities of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> and their phenotypic expressions, four naturally occurring missense mutations were chosen to analyze thier in vitro secretion profiles and functional characteristics, which illustrated the importance of in vitro experimental characterization in each and individual cases of naturally occurring missense mutations before marking them as the underlying genetic defect. (2) Since early nineties, the suggestion about the synergistic effect between two thrombotic risk factors when associated in one patient has been lacking a biochemical basis. The now observed deficient APC-cofactor activity of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> Heerlen in the degradation of FVa Leiden suggests a possible synergistic pathogenic mechanism between these two genetic traits resulting in increased risk of thrombosis. (3) In addition, using two monoclonal antibodies as probes the structure-function relationship studies on <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> and APC interaction were carried out. R 49, Q 52 in TSR was found to be part of the epitope of monoclonal HPS 67 and K 97, T 103 in EGF 1 for monoclonal HPS 54. These data implicated indirectly as the key amino acids for APC interaction, based on the fact that these two antibodies could completely block the APC-cofactor activity of <b>protein</b> <b>S.</b> The observation that HPS 67 did not inhibit phospholipid binding of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> has implications for the possible orientation of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> on the membrane surface, suggesting that TSR is free to interact with membrane-bound APC.

One amino acid Y 456 was found to be important residue for C 4 BP interaction in this region.

In this study we demonstrate that the binding of human <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) {{is required for the}} expression of cofactor activity of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> toward factor Va inactivation by activated protein C (APC). The initial rate of endothelial cell-mediated factor Va inactivation was 21. 7 pM factor Va/ 50 pM APC min- 1, which could be enhanced twice at a <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> concentration of 5 nM. This increase appeared to be specific for <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> because it could be inhibited by C 4 b-binding protein and polyclonal antibodies against <b>protein</b> <b>S.</b> Furthermore, thrombin-cleaved <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> did not accelerate factor Va inactivation by APC on endothelial cells. The binding of 125 I-protein S to endothelial cells was time-dependent, specific, saturable, and required the presence of calcium ions. Scatchard analysis revealed (8. 0 +/- 0. 3) x 10 (5) binding sites per cell with an apparent Kd of 24. 4 +/- 2. 2 nM. To study the physiological importance of the binding of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> to human endothelial cells, seven monoclonal antibodies were examined for their ability to influence the <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> cofactor activity and binding capacity. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain and the thrombin-sensitive region of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> completely inhibited the <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> cofactor <b>function</b> in factor Va inactivation by APC on HUVECs.

40|$|Activated protein C (APC) plays a {{critical}} anticoagulant role in vivo by inactivating procoagulant factor Va and factor VIIIa and thus down-regulating thrombin generation.

In this study we utilized a site-directed mutagenesis strategy to characterize a putative <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> binding region within the APC Gla domain. Three single amino acid substitutions within the APC Gla domain (D 35 T, D 36 A, and A 39 V) were found to mildly impair protein S-dependent anticoagulant activity (< 2 -fold) but retained entirely normal cytoprotective activity. However, a single amino acid substitution (L 38 D) ablated the ability of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> to <b>function</b> as a cofactor for this APC variant. Consequently, in assays of protein S-dependent factor Va proteolysis using purified proteins or in the plasma milieu, APC-L 38 D variant exhibited minimal residual anticoagulant activity compared with wild type APC.

40|$|C 4 b-binding protein (C 4 BP) is a high-molecular-mass {{glycoprotein}} {{which contains}} binding sites for complement component C 4 b, anti-coagulant vitamin K-dependent <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> and serum amyloid P component (SAP). The major form of C 4 BP in plasma {{is composed of}} seven identical alpha-chains and a single beta-chain. We have expressed full-length cDNA for the alpha-chain in a eukaryotic expression system and characterized functional properties of non-beta-chain-containing C 4 BP. During synthesis, recombinant alpha-chains polymerized into two different high-molecular-mass C 4 BP forms which were composed of seven or eight alpha-chains. Recombinant C 4 BP bound C 4 (H 2 O) (used instead of C 4 b) equally as well as native C 4 BP, functioned equally as well as factor I cofactor in the degradation of C 4 (H 2 O) and bound to SAP. In contrast, the recombinant C 4 BP did not bind <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> and therefore did not inhibit the ability of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> to <b>function</b> as a cofactor to activated protein C. Tunicamycin treatment of the transfected cells prevented N-linked glycosylation, but did not affect polymerization of the alpha-chains into a high-molecular-mass C 4 BP. The non-glycosylated C 4 BP had comparable properties to glycosylated C 4 BP in several functional assays. These results demonstrate polymerization of C 4 BP alpha-chains to be independent both of the beta-chain and of the N-linked carbohydrates. Moreover, N-linked carbohydrates and the beta-chain were neither required for the ability of C 4 BP to bind C 4 b and to function as factor I cofactor nor for the interaction with SAP...|$|R

In this report, recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (rHBsAg) particles, which contain only virus envelope proteins, were radioactively labeled, and their attachment to human liver membranes was examined. Only the rHBsAg particles containing the large <b>S</b> <b>protein</b> were capable of directly attaching to liver plasma membranes.

40|$|Abstract Background Activated protein C (APC) {{inhibits}} coagulation by degrading activated factor V (FVa) and factor VIII (FVIIIa), <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> (PS) <b>functioning</b> as a cofactor to APC. Methods By mutagenesis of {{the vitamin}} K-dependent Gla domain of APC, we have recently created an APC variant having enhanced anticoagulant activity {{due to increased}} affinity for negatively charged phospholipid membranes. In the present study, the potential antithrombotic effects of this APC variant, and of a variant APC that is additionally mutated in the serine protease domain, have been evaluated in a blind randomized study in a rat model of arterial thrombosis. In this model, we have previously found the combination of bovine APC and PS to be highly antithrombotic. Four treatment groups each containing 10 rats were, in a blind random fashion, given intravenous bolus injections of wild-type or mutant variants of APC (0. 8 mg/kg) together with human PS (0. 6 mg/kg) or human PS (0. 6 mg/kg) alone. A control group with 20 animals where given vehicle only. Results A trend to increased patency rates was noted in a group receiving one of the APC variants, {{but it did not}} reach statistical significance. Conclusion In conclusion, administration of human APC variants having enhanced anticoagulant efficacy together with human PS in a rat model of arterial thrombosis did not give an efficient antithrombotic effect. The lack of effect may be due to species-specific differences between the human protein C system and the rat hemostatic system. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Protein</b> <b>S</b> is a vitamin K-dependent {{plasma protein}} {{which serves as}} the {{cofactor}} for activated <b>protein</b> C. <b>Protein</b> <b>S</b> circulates in both an active, free form and in an inactive complex with C 4 b-binding protein. To elucidate the role of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> in disease states and during oral anticoagulation, we developed a functional assay for <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> that permits evaluation {{of the distribution of}} <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> between free and bound forms and permits determination of the specific activity of the free <b>protein</b> <b>S.</b> In liver disease, free <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> antigen is moderately reduced and the free <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> has significantly reduced specific activity.

40|$|A {{new method}} to {{determine}} the concentration of the free <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> in plasma is described. It is an enzyme-linked ligandsorbent assay (ELSA) which utilises the <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> binding capacity of the natural ligand C 4 b-binding protein (C 4 BP) to capture the free <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> from plasma samples. The use of C 4 BP as ligand in the assay is possible due to the high affinity (Kd = 0. 1 nM) {{of the interaction between}} <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> and C 4 BP and to a slow rate of complex dissociation. A monoclonal antibody (HPS 54) was conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and used as target antibody. This antibody recognises a Ca 2 + dependent epitope in the first EGF-like domain of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> and does not interfere with C 4 BP binding sites of <b>protein</b> <b>S.</b> Addition of calcium in the assay helped prevent dissociation of the C 4 BP-protein S-HPS 54 complex. Three different experiments demonstrated the assay to be specific for free <b>protein</b> <b>S.</b> First, near-identical dose response curves were obtained with <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> in plasma and with purified <b>protein</b> <b>S.</b> Second, addition of purified C 4 BP to normal plasma resulted in loss of free <b>protein</b> <b>S.</b> Third, <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> depleted plasma gave zero values and around 80 % of purified <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> added to <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> depleted plasma, and approximately 70 % of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> added to <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> deficient plasma samples, was recovered with the assay. The assay is fast (involves only a single incubation step of 30 min), sensitive and the range of measurement is 3 % to 200 % of free <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> when plasma dilution 1 : 20 represents 100 %. Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation at two levels were 2. 3 - 4. 3 % and 5. 1 - 7. 4 %, respectively. In a large <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> deficient family, the assay showed 100 % sensitivity and specifity for the causative mutation. Moreover, free <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> levels in anticoagulated <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> deficient patients were completely separated from those obtained in non-anticoagulated controls.

40|$|<b>Protein</b> <b>S</b> is a vitamin K-dependent non-enzymatic {{coagulation}} factor {{involved in the}} regulation of activated protein C (APC). In this paper we report an APC-independent anticoagulant <b>function</b> of <b>protein</b> <b>S.</b> We observed an inhibition of prothrombinase activity on endothelial cells and platelets which was half-maximal at physiological concentrations of free <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> in plasma. On endothelial cells, thrombin-cleaved <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> (PSt) as well as <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> in complex with C 4 b-binding protein (C 4 BP) inhibited prothrombinase activity {{to the same extent}} as <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> did. In solid-phase binding assays, direct binding of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> and PSt to factor V and factor Va were observed. Protein S-C 4 BP complex did not bind to factor V or factor Va, implicating that the factor V(a) binding site on <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> is lost by the interaction with C 4 BP. A direct inhibition of factor Xa activity by <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> was also observed. Incubation of factor Xa with <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> revealed a noncompetitive inhibition of factor Xa by <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> with a Ki of (4. 9 +/- 0. 8) x 10 (- 7) M. Both <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> and <b>protein</b> S-C 4 BP complex were able to inhibit factor Xa to the same extent, whereas PSt had lost its inhibitory activity. This suggests that the conformational change induced by cleavage of the amino-terminal thrombin-sensitive loop results in a loss of a factor Xa binding site on <b>protein</b> <b>S.</b> The inhibitory effect of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> involves interactions with both factor Va and factor Xa. The interaction of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> with factor Xa is influenced by cleavage of the thrombin-sensitive loop, whereas C 4 BP blocks the interaction of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> with factor Va. Inhibition of the prothrombinase complex by either forms of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> might be an important mechanism in regulating thrombin generation in blood coagulation. The importance of the APC-independent anticoagulant action of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> was emphasized by experiments in which the addition of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> to normal plasma induced a prolongation of clotting time in a dilute activated partial thromboplastin time (dAPTT) assay.

In plasma from healthy volunteers 25 % of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> is cleaved in the TSR.

40|$|<b>Protein</b> <b>S</b> is a vitamin-K {{dependent}} glycoprotein {{involved in}} the regulation of the anticoagulant activity of activated protein C (APC). Recent data showed a direct anticoagulant role of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> independent of APC, {{as demonstrated by the}} inhibition of prothrombinase and tenase activity both in plasma and in purified systems. This anticoagulant effect of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> can be explained either by a direct interaction of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> with one of the components of the complexes and/or by the interference with the binding of these components to phospholipid surfaces. During our investigation we noted that <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> preparations purified in different ways and derived from different sources, expressed discrepant APC cofactor and direct anticoagulant activity. In order to elucidate these differences and to study the mechanism of the APC-independent activity of <b>protein</b> <b>S,</b> we compared the <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> preparations in phospholipid-binding properties and anticoagulant activity. The dissociation constant for the binding of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> to immobilized phospholipids ranged from 7 to 74 nM for the different <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> preparations. APC-independent inhibition of both prothrombinase and tenase activity performed on phospholipid vesicles and in plasma showed a strong correlation with the affinity for phospholipids. The APC-independent activity could be abolished by monoclonal antibodies that were either calcium-dependent and/or directed against epitopes in the Gla-region of <b>protein</b> <b>S,</b> suggesting that the protein S-phospholipid interaction is crucial for the APC-independent anticoagulant <b>function</b> of <b>protein</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Protein</b> <b>S</b> preparations with a low APC-independent activity expressed a high APC-cofactor activity suggesting that the affinity of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> for phospholipids is of less importance in the expression of APC-cofactor activity of <b>protein</b> <b>S.</b> We conclude that high affinity interactions of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> with the membrane surface are essential for the direct anticoagulant activity of <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> and we suggest that inhibition of the prothrombinase and the tenase complex by <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> is a consequence of the occupation of the phospholipid surface by <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> molecule...|$|R

In protein S-deficient family members (n = 117), the equimolar relationship between <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> (215 ± 50 nmol/L) and C 4 BPβ+ (228 ± 51 nmol/L), together with the high affinity of the interaction, resulted in low levels of free <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> (16 ± 10 nmol/L). Free <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> levels were distinctly low in proteinS-deficient members, whereas in 47 of the protein S-deficient individuals, the concentration of total <b>protein</b> <b>S</b> was within the normal range, which fulfills the criteria for type III deficiency.
