40|$|Many {{developing}} countries have encouraged private sector participation in infrastructure activities during the 1990 s, including {{the development of}} <b>private</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> plants, known as independent power projects. The development of power projects involves multiple sets of negotiations with multiple actors {{over a period of}} time to ensure the successful completion of the project. The negotiation process has often been slow, contentious, and unpredictable. We highlight the implications of the complexity of power project development. We argue that the developers need to follow a "relationship-oriented" strategy, combining a strategy based on formal contracts and a strategy based on trust building. In such a combined approach, the appropriate balance between the two components shifts over the life cycle of the project. Trust building is critical at the initiation of the project, whereas complete contracting should dominate in the project implementation stage. Our analysis has broader implications for the successful initiation and implementation of politically salient investment projects in {{developing countries}}. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAvailability of {{electricity}} {{in developing countries}} is by no doubt a tool for development. However, the development cannot be sustainable if necessary back-up facilities are not in place. This is argued and demonstrated in this paper, using the last 10 years of development in Zanzibar as a case. In Zanzibar, the demand for electricity has grown fast {{and the amount of}} billed electricity increased with more than 50 % from year 2003 to year 2007. The highest increase {{can be seen in the}} medium sized industries sector, where the tourism sector consisted of a large proportion. With increased dependency {{of electricity}}, the fundament for a more vulnerable society is also created. This is illustrated by the economic and social depression that hit Zanzibar during the breakdowns of the power system that occurred for one month in 2008 and for almost three months in 2009 - 2010. As there where no public back-up generation facility in Zanzibar, this resulted in a total electrical blackout and the citizens had to rely on <b>private</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>generation.</b> In the paper some examples of the consequences are given.

Only 30 % of Bangladeshis have access to electricity, {{and those who do}} face poor quality service such as {{frequent}} blackouts and voltage variations.

40|$|We {{address the}} causes of {{electricity}} shortage in Pakistan by examining data over the 7 period 1971 - 2010 with time series analysis. The novelty lies in characterizing energy shortage via an index comprising the demands of electricity, gas and oil as well as via the information of public electricity supply. In particular, this index enables a simple empirical approach where energy shortage cannot be directly measured as data. Our main findings are as follows: first, end-consumers adjust their energy demand to the prices only in long run. Second, under-utilization of installed power generation capacity encourages fossil fuel consumption for private electricity. Third, uninterrupted electricity supply could be attained through regulating <b>private</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>generation.</b> Fourth, the relative demand for electricity increases and then decreases with real income in relation to gas and oil. Overall, our investigation implies that price adjustments tactics adopted by the government are not effective policies to deal with power shortage if oriented to short-run impacts. Rather, the government should focus on improving utilization rate of installed power plants and re-channeling the use {{of oil and gas}} for public electricity generation. Otherwise, energy shortage shall be worsened with economic growth in Pakistan...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. The recent {{transformation}} in the Ugandan energy sector {{has led to a}} significant surge in <b>private</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> companies in the country. These companies have a heterogeneous capital structure and they tend to charge different tariff rates for the electricity generated. While the capital structure might have an important role to play in differential tariff setting, it is not clear to what extent it influences the tariff structure of electricity generation projects. Thus, the objective {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of capital structure on the tariff of electricity generation projects in Uganda after controlling for other factors such as operation and maintenance costs, technology used for generation, project development costs, and installed capacity of generation plants on the generation tariffs. Using cross-sectional data from 29 companies as at September 2014, a bootstrap linear regression analysis was used for estimation. The results of the study indicated that the higher the debt portion in the capital structure, the lower the generation tariff. However, the impact of debt in the capital structure was not statistically significant. What stood out is that renewable technologies have a much lower generating tariff than non-renewable technologies...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> {{characteristics of a}} new energy-harvesting system with piezoelectric elements. The proposed system is composed of a rigid cylinder and thin plates at both ends. The piezoelectric elements are installed at the centers of both plates, and one side of each plate is subjected to a harmonic point force. In this system, vibration energy is converted into electrical energy via electromechanical coupling between the plate vibration and piezoelectric effect. In addition, the plate vibration excited by the point force induces a self-sustained vibration at the other plate via mechanical-acoustic coupling between the plate vibrations and an internal sound field into the cylindrical enclosure. Therefore, the <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> characteristics {{should be considered as}} an electromechanical-acoustic coupling problem. The characteristics are estimated theoretically and experimentally from the electric power in the <b>electricity</b> <b>generation,</b> the mechanical power supplied to the plate, and the <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> efficiency that is derived from the ratio of both power. In particular, the <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> efficiency {{is one of the most}} appropriate factors to evaluate a performance of <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> systems.

However, initial investment cost of PV system is considerable, and thus, it is crucial to predict <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> accurately before installation of the system. This study analyzes the loss ratio of solar photovoltaic <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> from the actual PV system monitoring data to predict <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> more accurately in advance. This study is carried out with the following five steps: (i) Data collection of actual <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> from PV system and the related information; (ii) Calculation of simulation-based electricity generation; (iii) Comparative analysis between actual <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> and simulation-based <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> based on the seasonality; (iv) Stochastic approach by defining probability distribution of loss ratio between actual <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> and simulation-based <b>electricity</b> generation; and (v) Case study by conducting Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) based on the probability distribution function of loss ratio.
