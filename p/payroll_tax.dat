5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{warnings}} from Noseworthy to control spending, Dunderdale's first budget saw spending increase by 4.9 percent. Spending {{was focused on}} infrastructure, health care, social programs, Nalcor Energy {{as well as other}} areas. The budget included tax credits for child care, volunteer fire fighters as well as an 8 percent Residential Energy Rebate on home heating fuel, which is equal to the provincial portion of the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). The budget raised the threshold on the <b>payroll</b> <b>tax</b> exemption from $1 million to $1.2 million. Despite a $598 million surplus for the previous year and a $59 surplus forecasted for the coming year, the province's net debt was expected to increase from $8.2 billion to $8.67 billion due to unfunded liabilities. However, on November 16, 2011, Dunderdale's government released their Fall economic update and announced that the surplus for the 2011-2012, fiscal year was now projected to be $755.8 million, with the added surplus going towards the debt.

Considering labor taxes levied on firms, the tax authorities may choose between employment and <b>payroll</b> <b>taxes</b> where the former is a head tax on the number of employees while the latter is a tax on the cost of labor to firms. Pisauro (1991) has shown in a short run efficiency wage model that the incidence of employment and <b>payroll</b> <b>taxes</b> generally differ and, in particular, that employment taxes lead to less wage restraint than <b>payroll</b> <b>taxes.</b> Extending his model to the long run by allowing for free entry and exit of firms we go one step further and consider whether changes in the composition of labor taxes, balancing the government budget, affect equilibrium unemployment in the long run. Our results reveat that, perhaps somewhat surprisingly given the result that <b>payroll</b> <b>taxes</b> lead to more wage restraint than employment taxes, that more extensive use of employment <b>taxes</b> instead of <b>payroll</b> <b>taxes,</b> balancing the government budget, increases the level of employment and decreases unemployment.

Levied by both the federal and provincial governments, <b>payroll</b> <b>taxes</b> in Canada include four major components: i) unemployment insurance (UI) premiums; ii) Canada/Quebec Pension Plan (C/QPP) contributions; iii) workers compensation (WC) premiums; and iv) the provincial health/post-secondary education (H/E) tax levied by Quebec, Manitoba, Ontario and Newfoundland. While the UI and C/QPP components are levied on both employers and employees, the WC and H/E components are levied on employers only. Our main findings are 1) <b>payroll</b> <b>taxes</b> have increased substantially over the last three decades in Canada as a whole and in every province; 2) the structure, level, growth and role of each component of <b>payroll</b> <b>taxes</b> vary remarkably from one province to another; 3) the expansion of the UI component {{in recent years has been}} the largest contributor to the rise in <b>payroll</b> <b>taxes</b> across every province in the country; and 4) despite significant growth in recent years, <b>payroll</b> <b>taxes</b> are still much lower in Canada than in most other western industrialized countries.
