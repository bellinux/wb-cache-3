40|$|URL] TJ-II {{stellarator}} is a mid-size Heliac design (high rotational transform, low magnetic shear) {{that allows}} for external control of the rotational transform profile. The long experience with locating diverse magnetic resonances at different <b>plasma</b> <b>radii</b> has assessed their reliability as transport controllers: in low density electron cyclotron heating plasmas, a "transport barrier effect" is found {{in most of the}} confinement zone accompanying magnetic resonances; in higher density and beta plasmas under neutral-beam heating operation, resonant layers show a clear incidence on the access to the H-mode of confinement or, likewise, on the back transition to L-mode. Moreover, confinement events similar to tokamak phenomenology have been also related with magneto-hydrodynamic activity around the magnetic resonances and are, consequently, amenable to external control. All in all, the TJ-II experience posits magnetic resonances as natural transport and stability controllers in toroidal plasmas. Further studies must either confirm or set operational limits to these findings.

40|$|Intrinsic {{toroidal}} plasma rotation due to {{the neoclassical}} toroidal plasma viscosity (NTV) effect induced by a three-dimensional helical magnetic field ripple in tokamaks is investigated in this paper. The intrinsic rotation is determined self-consistently by searching for {{the roots of the}} ambipolarity constraint, after evaluation of the particle fluxes from the numerical modelling. In the low-collisionality case, there are three roots, in which two are stable roots. One corresponds to the 'ion root' in the counter-current direction, and the other stable one corresponds to the 'electron root' in the co-current direction, near which the electron flux is dominant. Both of the two stable roots scale like the diamagnetic frequency. In the high-collisionality case, there is only one 'ion' root. The application of this modelling for International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) cases is discussed. In a large range of <b>plasma</b> <b>radii,</b> there are three roots. The NTV torque drives plasma rotation in ITER towards one of the stable roots, depending on the initial condition. The amplitudes of the electron roots near the pedestal in both baseline and steady-state scenarios are much larger than that of the ion roots.
