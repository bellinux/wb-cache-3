5|$|On 16 May 1289, the priory {{suffered}} a catastrophic fire. According to an account by Walter of Guisborough, a plumber soldering the lead roof forgot to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> fire, causing the roof timbers to catch fire and molten lead ran {{down into the}} church below. Much of the building was destroyed and many effects, costly books, chalices and vestments were lost. The canons sought {{to raise funds for}} rebuilding. They petitioned the king to grant them the advowsons of the parish churches of Barnham, Easington and Heslerton, and in 1309 and 1311 the Archbishop of York and the Bishop of Durham rewarded the priory's donors with indulgences granting remission of temporal punishment for sins. Most of the nave and chancel was rebuilt {{with the support of the}} de Brus family, whose coat of arms was displayed on its buildings.|$|E
5|$|A {{narrative}} pattern follows, whereby Cet {{demands a}} challenge, an Ulster warrior rises, and the Ulaid cry out {{the name of}} the challenger; Cet then proceeds to shame that warrior by recounting one of his deeds against him, as above. Cet shames the challenger Óengus son of Lam Gabuid, by recounting how he had cut off Lam Gabuid's hands in battle; he shames Éogan son of Durthacht, the king of Fermag, by recounting how he <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> eye in a cattle-raid; he reminds Muinremur son of Gerrgend how he had taken his son's head as a trophy not six days earlier; Mend son of Salchad, how he had cut off his father's foot; Celtchair son of Uthecar, how he had castrated him with his spear; and even Conchobar's son Cúscraid Mend Machae, how he had pierced his neck with a spear during Cúscraid's first feat of arms, in ignominious circumstances which led to the abandonment a third of Cúscraid's retinue in a cowardly retreat. In each case, the challenging warriors are compelled to retake their seats in shame.|$|E
5|$|John McFall {{was born}} on 25 April 1981 in Frimley, Surrey, in England. Between 1994 and 1997 he {{attended}} school at Millfield in Street, Somerset, where as a teenager he was a runner and hockey player. In August 2000 while on a gap-year trip to Ko Samui, Thailand, after his A-levels, {{he was involved in}} a serious motorcycle accident. While riding a moped, he went round a corner too quickly and skidded. He <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> leg to stop the motorcycle from falling over, and smashed his knee. The motorcycle then fell on him, resulting in the chain severing major blood vessels in his leg. He was flown to a hospital in Bangkok, but as he had damaged his lower right leg too severely, it had to be amputated above the knee after three days. Upon returning to the UK, he spent about seven weeks undergoing rehabilitation at Queen Mary's Hospital in Roehampton, London.|$|E

5|$|The ship briefly {{operated}} between Glasgow {{and other}} ports in Scotland for Hutcheson's West Highland Service {{before she was}} purchased in September 1861 by James D. Bulloch, the primary foreign agent in Great Britain for the Confederacy, to deliver the military and naval ordnance and supplies that he had purchased. To disguise his control of Fingal, and the destination of her cargo, Bulloch hired an English crew and captain and <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> destination as Bermuda and Nassau in the Bahamas. The cargo was loaded in Greenock in early October, although Bullock and the other passengers would not attempt to board until they rendezvoused with the ship at Holyhead, Wales. On the night 14/15 October, as she was slowly rounding the breakwater at Holyhead, Fingal rammed and sank the Austrian brig Siccardi, slowly swinging at anchor without lights. Bulloch and the passengers embarked in the steamer while Bulloch dispatched {{a letter to his}} financial agents instructing them to settle damages with the brig's owners because he could not afford {{to take the time to}} deal with the affair lest he and Fingal be detained. The ship reached Bermuda on 2 November and, after leaving port on 7 November, Bulloch informed the crew that the steamer's real destination was Savannah, Georgia; he offered to take anyone who objected to the plan to Nassau. However, all of the crew agreed to join in the effort to run the Union blockade. Fingal was able slip safely into the Savannah estuary in a heavy fog on the night of 12 November without sighting any blockaders.|$|E
25|$|Bassarabescu {{benefited from}} the rise of an authoritarian single-party regime during the early month of World War II. He made a publicized bid to join the National Renaissance Front, and was {{accepted}} into its ranks on Christmas Day, 1939. In 1940, Casa Școalelor <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> Opere complete ("Complete Works"). As a guest of the Romanian Atheneum, Bassarabescu introduced the public to the largely forgotten work of a 19th-century female writer, Sofia Cocea.|$|E
25|$|Patrese {{began to}} charge, passing Berger on lap 7. As Mansell was having {{difficulty}} {{finding a way}} around Senna, he <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand and waved Patrese ahead of him. He then attacked Senna and took the lead on lap 26. However, on the next lap, Patrese spun {{and he could not}} select full gears then. He went to the pits and retired. At the same time, Prost passed Berger to take third. Mansell now began to hound Senna and went all directions to get ahead.|$|E

25|$|Hightower {{claimed that}} the natives were angry to have their beloved god taken, and that they {{threatened}} that the idol would curse him. On New Year's Eve, 1899, Hightower {{held a press conference}} about his expedition to Africa, followed by a huge party. Hightower boasted about how he acquired the idol and denied claims of it being cursed. Just as he left the party, he mocked the idol, using its head to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> cigar. Around midnight, he entered the elevator to retire to his private apartments in the hotel penthouse. As the elevator neared the top, the idol came to life.|$|E
25|$|David {{gathered}} {{together all the}} chosen men of Israel — 30,000 in all — and went to retrieve the Ark of the Covenant from Baale-judah. They brought the Ark {{out of the house}} of Abinadab and set it on a new cart. Abinadab's sons Uzzah and Ahio drove the cart, with Ahio going before the Ark. David and the Israelites played with all manner of instruments — harps, psalteries, timbrels, sistra, and cymbals. When they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand to the Ark. In anger, God smote Uzzah for his error, and Uzzah died by the Ark.|$|E
500|$|Fifteen {{years after}} the rescue, the USAF held a {{symposium}} at Nellis AFB and invited all those directly involved. John Van Etten, whose call sign was Nail 32, had never met Gene Hambleton in person. When he stepped on stage and <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand to Gene, he said, [...] "Hello, Gene, I'm John Van Etten," [...] and Gene replied, [...] "No, you're not....you are Nail 32, I would recognize that voice anywhere!" ...|$|E

500|$|A second {{expedition}} in 1102 saw incursions into Ireland; the Heimskringla saga {{reports that}} he obtained Muirchertach Ua Briain's daughter Bjaðmunjo in marriage to his young son, Sigurd, whom he then left in nominal charge of the isles. This arrangement did not last long. On 23 August 1103 Magnus was killed fighting in Ulster and the 14-year-old Sigurd returned to Norway without his bride. The next king was Lagmann Godredsson, Godred Crovan's son, who was apparently appointed with Sigurd's consent. He successfully fought off a rebellion by his brother Harald and after reigning for seven years he abdicated [...] "repenting that he had <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> brother's eyes" [...] and went {{on a pilgrimage to}} Jerusalem, where he died.|$|E
500|$|This {{authorization}} {{from the}} Pope to proceed against Eadberht was delayed until 798, {{but once it}} was received Coenwulf took action. The Mercians captured Eadberht, <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> eyes and cut off his hands, and led him in chains to Mercia, where according to later tradition he was imprisoned at Winchcombe, a religious house closely affiliated with Coenwulf's family. By 801 at the latest Coenwulf had placed his brother, Cuthred, on the throne of Kent. Cuthred ruled until {{the time of his}} death in 807, after which Coenwulf took control of Kent in name as well as fact. Coenwulf styled himself [...] "King of the Mercians and the Province of Kent" [...] (rex Merciorum atque provincie Cancie) in a charter dated 809.|$|E
500|$|Even {{with this}} expansion, public {{officials}} wanted more. In 1922, Major John Hylan <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> plan for over 100 miles of new subway lines {{going to all}} five boroughs. His plan was intended to directly compete with the two private subway operators, the IRT and the BMT. This plan was never furthered. The next big plan, and arguably the most ambitious in the subway system's history, was the [...] "Second System." [...] The 1929 plan by the Independent Subway to construct new subway lines, the Second System would take over existing subway lines and railroad right-of-ways. This plan would have expanded service throughout the city with 100 miles of subway lines. A major component of the plan was {{the construction of the}} Second Avenue Subway. However, the Stock Market Crash of 1929 put a halt to the plan, and subway expansion was limited to lines already under construction by the IND.|$|E
6000|$|... "Continue, if you please," [...] said Klesmer, <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{lips and}} shaking his long fingers, while {{he went on}} with a smothered {{articulation}} quite unintelligible to the audience.|$|R

500|$|With this statement, {{all of the}} Æsir look to one another, finding {{themselves}} in a dilemma. Everyone refused to place their hand in Fenrir's mouth until Týr <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> right hand and placed it into the wolf's jaws. When Fenrir kicked, Gleipnir caught tightly, and the more Fenrir struggled, the stronger the band grew. At this, everyone laughed, except Týr, who there lost his right hand. When the gods knew that Fenrir was fully bound, they took a cord called Gelgja (Old Norse [...] "fetter") hanging from Gleipnir, inserted the cord through a large stone slab called Gjöll (Old Norse [...] "scream"), and the gods fastened the stone slab deep into the ground. After, the gods took a great rock called Thviti (Old Norse [...] "hitter, batterer"), and thrust it even further into the ground as an anchoring peg. Fenrir reacted violently; he opened his jaws very wide, and tried to bite the gods.|$|E
2500|$|His other {{translation}} work, published independently, covered prose: in 1904, texts by Camille Flammarion; in 1908, Maurice Maeterlinck's Intelligence of Flowers, Guy de Maupassant's Une vie, Henryk Sienkiewicz's Quo Vadis and Hermann Sudermann's Tale of the Idle Millstone; in 1909, book two of Gulliver's Travels. The same year, {{he joined}} the Romanian Writers' Society, then under the presidency of Mihail Sadoveanu. He also <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> translation of Boule de Suif, much criticized by Mihai Codreanu for failing to render Maupassant's meanings and turns of phrase, a [...] "perseverance in bad translation." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Wyatt {{and his men}} approached, the two men ran. Stilwell {{may have}} {{stumbled}} or been wounded, allowing Wyatt to reach him. Wyatt later said he shot Stilwell as Stilwell attempted to push the barrel of Earp's shotgun away. Wyatt, quoted in the Denver Republican, said [...] "I ran straight for Stilwell. It was he who killed my brother. What a coward he was! He couldn't shoot when I came near him. He stood there helpless and trembling for his life. As I rushed upon him he <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hands and clutched at my shotgun. I let go both barrels, and he tumbled down dead and mangled at my feet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nina," [...] he said, <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand, {{and holding}} hers as he spoke, [...] "I hardly {{expected}} you this evening; but I {{am glad to}} see you--very glad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you {{quite well}} this morning, Miss Tulliver?" [...] said Stephen, turning to Maggie with stiff politeness, and <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{hand with the}} air of {{fulfilling}} a social duty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bishop of Barchester, I presume?" [...] said Bertie Stanhope, <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand frankly; [...] "I am {{delighted to}} make your acquaintance. We are in rather close {{quarters}} here, a'nt we?" ...|$|R
2500|$|On 29 June 1613, the Globe Theatre went up {{in flames}} during a {{performance}} of Henry VIII. A theatrical cannon, set off during the performance, misfired, igniting the wooden beams and thatching. According {{to one of the}} few surviving documents of the event, no one was hurt except a man who <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> burning breeches with a bottle of ale. The event pinpoints the date of a Shakespeare play with rare precision. Sir Henry Wotton recorded that the play [...] "was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony". The theatre was rebuilt but, like all the other theatres in London, the Globe was closed down by the Puritans in 1642.|$|E
2500|$|Rundgren's back-up {{band for}} A Wizard, a True Star (1973) {{evolved into the}} first version of Utopia, a larger prog-rock ensemble, which {{included}} multiple keyboards, synthesizers and brass and featured a character completely disguised in a silver suit, [...] "M. Frog Labat" [...] (Jean-Yves Labat de Rossi) on synthesizers, who also <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> own electronics/keyboards-based solo album. This incarnation premiered on Todd Rundgren's Utopia (1974), which was book-ended by the 14-minute [...] "Utopia Theme" [...] (recorded live in concert) and the 30-minute suite [...] "The Ikon", which occupied the whole of Side 2 of the album. Like Wizard, the album also showcased Rundgren's skills as a recording and mastering engineer, clocking in at over 30minutes per side.|$|E
2500|$|Buzdugan {{was working}} on a volume of {{patriotic}} poetry, which came out that year as Țara mea ("My Country"). In October 1918, Sfatul Ţăriis eponymous journal <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> monograph on the history of boyardom and peasantry in Bessarabia. Late that November, he was reelected Secretary of Sfatul, in circumstances that were deemed illegal by the anti-unionist opposition; under his watch, unconditional union (which excluded the regionalist provisions of the March document) was put to the vote. Buzdugan joined Halippa, Pelivan, and Cazacliu on a Sfatul mission to Cernăuți, in Bukovina, and Alba Iulia, in Transylvania, where they were to attend popular assemblies confirming the establishment of Greater Romania. In Bukovina, Buzdugan expressed his enthusiasm for [...] "our national cause, the awakening of the entire nation between the Nistru and the Tisa." [...] However, bedridden with the Spanish flu in Cernăuți, he was unable to follow Pelivan to Alba Iulia, and failed to witness Transylvania's incorporation into Romania on December 1 ("Great Union Day").|$|E
