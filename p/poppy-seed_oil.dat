2500|$|Iodized <b>poppy-seed</b> <b>oil</b> has an {{especially}} {{high rate of}} uptake into the cells of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). [...] This property was soon recognized {{as an opportunity to}} deliver to HCC a variety of highly toxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy agents, and formed the basis of several therapies for HCC not treatable by surgery alone. [...] Injected emulsions of epirubicin in lipiodol are popular, but greater stability is needed.|$|E
5000|$|Oxide of iron is used chiefly {{as a base}} in paints {{used for}} {{covering}} ironwork, the theory being that no destructive galvanic action can be set up, as might {{be the case with}} lead paint when used on iron. A variety of red pigments are made from oxide of iron, varying in hue from a pale to a deep brownish-red. They are quite permanent, and may be used under any conditions. The vehicle is a liquid in which the particles of the base are held in suspension, enabling a thin coat of paint to be formed, uniform in color and consistency, and which on drying forms a kind of skin over the surface to which it is applied. For oil paint the vehicles used are oils; for distemper water is employed. The oils used as vehicles are chiefly linseed oil, raw and boiled, and <b>poppy-seed</b> <b>oil.</b> Nut oils are occasionally used for inferior work because they are much cheaper. Linseed oil, the one most commonly used, is obtained from the seeds of flax by warming it and squeezing out the oil under hydraulic pressure. The resultant, which is of a transparent amber color, is known as [...] "raw oil". It is used principally in interiors for light, bright colors, drying somewhat slowly and giving a firm elastic coat. The oil improves by keeping, and is sometimes refined with acids or alkalis.|$|E
50|$|Boiled oil is the raw {{oil heated}} with driers, such as {{litharge}} or red lead, to a temperature from 350° to 500 °F, {{at which it}} is maintained {{for three or four}} hours. It is thick and much darker in color than the raw oil, drying much more quickly, with a coat hard and glossy but less elastic than that produced by raw oil. <b>Poppy-seed</b> <b>oil</b> is expressed from the seeds of the poppy plant. It does not possess the tenacity and quick-drying powers of boiled linseed oil, but being of a very light color it is used for delicate colors. Turpentine is used as a solvent, diluent, or thinner, to bring the paint to a proper consistency so as to allow it to be spread in a thin even coat. When a flat dull surface is desired, turpentine alone is used with the base and the oil is omitted. The best turpentine comes from the pine forests of America. French turpentine is next in quality. Russian turpentine is the cheapest, and has usually a strong and unpleasant odor that renders it objectionable to work with. In consequence of the high price of turpentine of good quality, and the increasing difficulty of obtaining it, substitutes are coming into general use. Driers are substances usually added to paint to hasten the process of oxidation, i.e. the drying, of the oil. Some pigments possess this quality, as red lead and white lead.|$|E
40|$|Micro-Raman {{spectroscopy}} (MRS) {{allows the}} identification of binding media and varnishes in paintings. This non-destructive micro-analytical method {{has been used for}} the recording of spectra (1800 – 200 cm− 1) of different types of proteinaceous (al-bumin, casein, gelatin, isinglass, fish glue), polysaccharide (starch, gum arabic, tragacanth, cherry gum), fatty acid (beeswax, linseed oil, <b>poppy-seed</b> <b>oil,</b> walnut oil, sunflower oil) and resinous media (shellac, dammar, colophony, sandarac, copal, el...|$|E
40|$|Delivering {{emulsions}} of anthracycline {{drugs in}} Lipiodol, an iodinated <b>poppy-seed</b> <b>oil,</b> via the hepatic artery {{for the treatment}} of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become increasingly popular. However, investigations {{to determine the extent to}} which the Lipiodol sequesters the anthracycline in the liver have been limited. Concern has been expressed that such emulsions are not stable and that the anthracycline is, therefore, released rapidly into the circulation. We studied the pharmacokinetics of epirubicin (50 mg m(- 2)) in five patients with nonresectable primary hepatocellular carcinoma after infusion of an epirubicin/lipiodol emulsion via the hepatic artery. We used a reliable and specific high-performance liquid chromatography assay that allows quantitation of plasma concentrations of epirubicin, epirubicinol, epirubicin glucuronide, and epirubicin aglycone. Although a large interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics was observed, our results were similar to historical data after epirubicin intravenous therapy. Only the results from one patient provided evidence of significant retention of the drug in the liver. It would appear that more stable formulations of epirubicin/Lipiodol are required to increase the efficacy of this form of treatment. We suggest that pharmacokinetic studies should accompany clinical evaluation of emulsions of epirubicin/Lipiodol {{for the treatment of}} HCC...|$|E
40|$|Iodine {{deficiency}} is a {{major cause}} of impaired mental development, goitre, and cretinism {{in many parts of the}} world. Because existing immunization programmes can be used to deliver oral iodized oil (OIO) to infants at risk, it was important to know whether OIO could adversely affect the antibody response to vaccines, such as trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in Subang, West Java, Indonesia, in which 617 eight-week-old infants received either OIO or a placebo (<b>poppy-seed</b> <b>oil)</b> during a routine visit for their first dose of OPV as part of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). The infants received two boosters of OPV at 4 -week intervals after the first dose, and were followed up when 6 months old. Neutralizing antibody titres to poliovirus serotypes 1, 2, and 3 were compared in serum samples that were taken from 478 of these infants just before the first dose of OPV and at 6 months. It was found that oral iodized oil did not reduce the antibody responses to any of the three serotypes of OPV. These results indicate that oral iodine may safely be delivered to infants at the same time as oral poliovirus vaccine according to current EPI immunization schedules...|$|E
40|$|This report {{covers the}} results of an {{investigation}} carried on at the Bureau of Standards under a research authorization from, and with the financial assistance of, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. The choice of a damping liquid for aircraft instruments is difficult owing to the range of temperature at which aircraft operate. Temperature changes affect the viscosity tremendously. The investigation was undertaken with the object of finding liquids of various viscosities otherwise suitable which had a minimum change in viscosity with temperature. The new data relate largely to solutions. The effect of temperature on the kinematic viscosity of the following liquids and solutions was determined in the temperature interval - 18 degrees to + 30 degrees C. (1) solutions of animal and vegetable oils in xylene. These were <b>poppy-seed</b> <b>oil,</b> two samples of neat's-foot oils, castor oil, and linseed oil. (2) solutions of mineral oil in xylene. These were Squibb's petrolatum of naphthene base and transformer oil. (3) glycerine solutions in ethyl alcohol and in mixture of 50 - 50 ethyl alcohol and water. (4) mixtures of normal butyl alcohol with methyl alcohol. (5) individual liquids, kerosene, mineral spirits, xylene, recoil oil. The apparatus consisted of four capillary-tube viscometers, which were immersed in a liquid bath in order to secure temperature control. The method of calibration and the related experimental data are presented...|$|E
40|$|Cardiac {{troponin}} I (cTnI) {{has been}} found to be a sensitive and reliable marker of myocardial damage, and elevated levels of cTnI can indicate high risk for acute coronary syndrome. To determine how to intervene in possible cases of acute coronary syndrome, cTnI levels must be measured by immunoassay. However, cTnI immunoassay results are prone to interference from many substances such as heparin and common drugs. The contrast media used in the coronary angiography might also interfere with results. To explore this possibility, we performed two in vivo and two in vitro studies. In the first in vivo study, we evaluated the effects of contrast media on cTnI immunoassays by collecting blood samples from 45 patients undergoing coronary angiography before and after the procedure. We used the Opus Magnum immunoassay system to measure cTnI levels. In the second in vivo study, we collected 25 blood samples from another group of patients also undergoing angiography at various times before and after the procedure to determine cTnI values by both the Opus Magnum and ACCESS systems. In the first in vitro study, 12 different contrast media were treated as samples to disclose the potential interference of measurement in the two assay systems. In the second in vitro study, we made sequential dilutions of iopromide (Ultravist; Schering) with serum to explore their potential for interfering with the detection of cTnI by the Opus Magnum and ACCESS assays. In the first in vivo study using the Opus Magnum assay, cTnI concentrations in samples taken after angiography were significantly higher at 5 minutes than at 30 minutes, and, at 60 minutes, all cTnI concentrations had dropped below the cutoff point. In the second in vivo study, we found a substantial difference in detection of cTnI by the Opus Magnum and ACCESS assays. All cTnI concentrations checked by ACCESS assay were below the cutoff value. In our first in vitro study, the Opus Magnum assay gave false positive results for all 12 contrast media; the ACCESS assay gave a positive result for only one contrast medium, <b>poppy-seed</b> <b>oil</b> (Lipiodol; Guebert). In our second in vitro study, we found that, in the Opus Magnum assay, the more concentrated the contrast medium, the higher the cTnI value, but not in the ACCESS assay. We conclude that contrast media may cause false-positive results in cTnI assays and that, when contrast media are being used for angiography, cTnI results, especially those based on samples taken within the first hour of the procedure, should be interpreted carefully...|$|E
