50|$|The time {{interval}} between subsequent echolocation calls (or pulses) determines {{two aspects of}} a bat's perception. First, it establishes how quickly the bat's auditory scene information is updated. For example, bats increase the repetition rate of their calls (that is, decrease the <b>pulse</b> <b>interval)</b> as they home in on a target. This allows the bat to get new information regarding the target's location {{at a faster rate}} when it needs it most. Secondly, the <b>pulse</b> <b>interval</b> determines the maximum range that bats can detect objects. This is because bats can only keep track of the echoes from one call at a time; as soon as they make another call they stop listening for echoes from the previously made call. For example, a <b>pulse</b> <b>interval</b> of 100 ms (typical of a bat searching for insects) allows sound to travel in air roughly 34 meters so a bat can only detect objects as far away as 17 meters (the sound has to travel out and back). With a <b>pulse</b> <b>interval</b> of 5 ms (typical of a bat in the final moments of a capture attempt), the bat can only detect objects up to 85 cm away. Therefore, the bat constantly has to make a choice between getting new information updated quickly and detecting objects far away.|$|E

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim was {{to assess}} the value of baroreflex {{sensitivity}} estimates calculated from analyses of spontaneous systolic blood pressure and <b>pulse</b> <b>interval</b> sequences derived from continuous non-invasive finger blood pressure recordings during sitting and active standing. DESIGN: Continuous recordings of digital systolic blood pressure and <b>pulse</b> <b>interval</b> were obtained non-invasively using a Finapres FD 5 during 5 min trials of sitting and standing. SUBJECTS: Subjects were healthy males aged 19 - 28, divided into those with "high" normal (n = 18) and "low" normal (n = 17) blood pressure. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Recordings were scanned for spontaneous sequences of three or more cardiac cycles over which systolic blood pressure increased progressively in conjunction with prolonged <b>pulse</b> <b>interval,</b> or decreased while <b>pulse</b> <b>interval</b> became shorter. Regressions between blood pressure and <b>pulse</b> <b>interval</b> (r greater than 0. 80) provided estimates of cardiac baroreceptor reflex control. Computations were carried out with concurrent blood pressure and <b>pulse</b> <b>interval</b> measurements, and with a delay or lag of one and two cycles between the two variables. <b>Pulse</b> <b>interval</b> was reduced from an average 870. 3 ms sitting to 571. 3 ms on standing. Mean baroreflex sensitivity while sitting averaged 17. 5 ms. mm Hg- 1 at a delay of one cycle, failing to 7. 65 ms. mm Hg- 1 with standing. The decrease in sensitivity was correlated with the change in <b>pulse</b> <b>interval</b> between trials. The number of sequences was also significantly reduced with standing as opposed to sitting. Three cycle sequences were most frequent, with a lesser number of sequences involving 4, 5, and 6 or more cycles. No significant differences between "high" and "low" normal blood pressure groups were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of spontaneous sequences from non-invasive recordings may provide useful information concerning cardiac baroreflex control in different postural and behavioural states. A lag of one cycle between systolic blood pressure and <b>pulse</b> <b>interval</b> may provide the most representative estimates of baroreflex sensitivity...|$|E

Beat-to-beat blood pressure was measured by Finapres during 20 minutes supine and 10 minutes standing. Overall systolic and diastolic blood pressures and <b>pulse</b> <b>interval</b> variability were determined as SD and as coefficient of variation. Also, relative powers of the mid-frequency (0. 08 to 0. 12 Hz) and high-frequency bands (0. 15 to 0. 40 Hz) were determined by spectral analysis. In these subjects no differences in blood pressure variability (either as SD or coefficient of variation) were found between age groups, except for the coefficient of variation of standing diastolic blood pressure, which decreased with aging. <b>Pulse</b> <b>interval</b> variability decreased with aging. Power of the mid-frequency band of systolic and diastolic blood pressures was markedly decreased in the elderly, especially in the standing position. Power of the high-frequency band of <b>pulse</b> <b>interval</b> was also decreased in the elderly. Baroreflex sensitivity calculated by fast Fourier transformation spectral analysis was decreased in the elderly subjects compared with the younger groups. In conclusion, we found no change in the overall variability of blood pressure with aging. Mid-frequency spectral power of blood pressure and mid- and high-frequency spectral powers of <b>pulse</b> <b>interval</b> variability were decreased in the elderly.

In an experiment, 78 observers rated the perceived urgency of uni-, bi-, and/or tri-modal stimuli as function of 25 combinations of pulse duration (range 100 – 1600 ms) and inter <b>pulse</b> <b>interval</b> length (100 – 1600 ms). The results showed that perceived urgency increases with signal rate. Inter <b>pulse</b> <b>interval</b> showed a larger effect than pulse duration and the largest differences in perceived urgency as function of inter <b>pulse</b> <b>interval</b> occurred at the smallest pulse duration (100 ms). The effects of pulse duration and inter <b>pulse</b> <b>interval</b> were universal across modalities. Bi- and tri-modal signals were perceived as more urgent than each of their uni-modal constituents. We conclude that temporal parameters can be deployed to construct integrated, multi-sensory warning signals with a pre-specified degree of perceived urgency. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Correlation figure of average <b>pulse</b> <b>intervals</b> and standard deviation of the intervals showed a tendency that better regulation was performed within shorter intervals and worse in longer intervals in untreated prone position rabbits. 2. Two term components which seemed to reflect the regulation function of each respiration interval, occurred with high frequency under conditions of supine position, trans-π-oxocamphor, and strychnine nitrate administration and acute experimental anemia. The frequency was low in chlorpromazine administration. 3. Pulse and respiration slow rhythms could occur without the nerve centers higher than the upper colliculi of Corpora quadrigemina. 4.

In chlorpromazine administration, there was a tendency for the relatively regular slow rhythms to become apparent and for the longer period component to decrease in both pulse and respiration slow rhythms. 6. In trans-π-oxocamphor administered animals, there was a tendency for the number of components included in a series of <b>pulse</b> <b>intervals</b> to increase; the distribution figure of the period was divided into two groups separating at the point of about 15 sec., and 50 terms. 7.

The aim of our {{study was to explore}} whether, in hypertensive subjects, the degree of autonomic dysfunction and the level of salt sensitivity are correlated even when the latter is only mildly elevated and displays under-threshold values. Salt sensitivity of 34 essential hypertensive subjects was assessed on a continuous basis by the salt sensitivity index after low- and high-sodium diet. Beat-by-beat finger blood pressure was recorded after each diet period. Autonomic cardiovascular control was evaluated by spectral analysis of blood pressure and <b>pulse</b> <b>interval</b> and by assessment of spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (sequence technique). Salt sensitivity and baroreflex sensitivity showed a negative relationship during low and high sodium intake, starting from low values of the salt sensitivity index. All spectral indexes of <b>pulse</b> <b>interval,</b> except the ratio between low- and high-frequency powers, were inversely related to salt sensitivity index after high sodium intake. In subjects with lower salt sensitivity, baroreflex sensitivity and <b>pulse</b> <b>interval</b> power in the high-frequency band were higher after high sodium intake than after low sodium intake. In contrast, subjects with a higher salt sensitivity index showed lower values of baroreflex sensitivity and <b>pulse</b> <b>interval</b> power in the high-frequency band, uninfluenced by salt intake.

We analyze wavelet-denoised burst profiles binned to several resolutions, identifying significant fluctuations between pulse structures and interjacent valleys. When bursts are ranked by peak flux, an interval time-dilation signature is evident, but its magnitude an...|$|R
