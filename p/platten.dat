5|$|Within {{the party}} was {{established}} a Political Bureau ("Politburo") and Organisation Bureau ("Orgburo") to accompany the existing Central Committee; the decisions of these party bodies had to be adopted by Sovnarkom and the Council of Labour and Defence. Lenin was the most significant figure in this governance structure; {{as well as being}} the Chairman of Sovnarkom and sitting on the Council of Labour and Defence, he was on the Central Committee and Politburo of the Communist Party. The only individual to have anywhere near this influence was Lenin's right-hand man, Yakov Sverdlov, who died in March 1919 during a flu pandemic. In November 1917, Lenin and his wife took a two-room flat within the Smolny Institute; the following month they left for a brief holiday in Halia, Finland. In January 1918, he survived an assassination attempt in Petrograd; Fritz <b>Platten,</b> who was with Lenin at the time, shielded him and was injured by a bullet.|$|E

Methods Theory was build up by researching method alongside with studiing technical literature. Testing {{group consisted of}} professional golfers. Weight transfer was measured by two <b>plattens</b> KISTLER a kinematics of movement was observed by kinematic analysartor CODA motion system. The analysis of interindividual and intraindividual stability was based on data collected during the testing of professional golf players. Results High interindiviual and intraindividual stability of execution was proved due to parametres weight transfer and accuracy. It was proved that capability of accuracy and stability of execution weight transfering is decreasing alongside with longer distance. For description of weight transfer critical phazes of movement were estabilished. By the measurement was discovered how the weight is transferred during the putting stroke.

40|$|Fragmentation loads, {{the loads}} under which {{individual}} particles fragment between <b>plattens,</b> were measured for quartz from weathered samples of a granite and from points along a stream system draining the granite surface. Stream transportation caused major destruction of 2 - 5 mm quartz {{in a few}} kilometers. 1 - 2 mm particles were less affected and breakage of 0. 5 - 1. 0 mm quartz was more than compensated by production of new grains created by breakage of coarser ones. Most breakage probably occurs in the bedload zone during floods, particularly {{in the presence of}} mov-ing pebbles. Greater mobility enables small grains to outlast larger, stronger ones in this environment. Not only are small grains more easily kept above the breakage zone in suspension but they are probably much more readily moved away from impending impact points between pebbles by momentary radiating currents generated around such points just before the pebbles impact. Downstream fining of river sediments is due to both hydraulic separation and breakage. The latter is very important in headwater regions but its effectiveness probably wanes downstream in large rivers...|$|R
40|$|The work {{undertaken}} {{in this thesis}} aim at improving the dimensional stability of particleboards caused by water absorption and stress relaxation both of which often occur simultaneously in finished composite board products. Dimensional instability was quantified by measuring the board percent thickness increase resulting from: i) springbuck on press opening; ii) reversible swelling subjected to moisture or solvent absorption and, iii) irreversible swelling due to stress release The reversible swelling was measured after a complete wetting or a humidity cycle from low to high humidity levels. The irreversible swelling was assessed after a complete drying or a humidity cycle from high to low humidity levels. Chemical modification of wood aimed at reducing the reversible swelling due to moisture absorption was attempted after the sequential replacement of water in wood by solvents. P. radiata and E. Obliqua blocks saturated with water were sequentially treated with polar followed by non-polar solvents in order to replace {{the water in the}} woods. Both species showed about 30 % retention of their original (green) volume after the final stage of treatment. The partially swollen P. radiata blocks were then chemically treated with the wood cell wall-bulking and cross-linking agents, i. e. acetic anhydride and paraformaldehyde respectively. Wood thickness swell was monitored through cyclic wetting and drying tests. The results showed that the dimensional stability of neither the acetylated nor the paraformaldehyde treated sample were improved as quantified by the anti-swelling efficiency (ASE). The presence of a catalyst (ferric chloride) was necessary to enhance the cell wall cross-linking and to improve the wood dimensional stability. This work identified that a chemical reaction between the reagents and the wood is necessary for achieving dimensional stability. Stress relaxation from springbuck and irreversible recovery are inherent in wood particles which have been stressed. Much of this work focused on reducing this stress in situ during wood composite panel consolidation. Chemical conditioning of wood materials by ammonia in situ during consolidation was studied using phenolic-based resin systems. Ammonium hydroxide (source for ammonia) was found to accelerate the curing of phenol-resorcinol-formaldehyde (PRF). Accelerated curing was also found for 50 : 50 (w/w) mixtures of PRF and phenol-urea-formaldehyde (PUF) at low temperatures between 45 C and 75 C and in the presence of formaldehyde. The PRF:PUF (50 : 50) resin system showed a significantly faster cure than the PRF resin in the presence of ammonium hydroxide at all levels of temperatures investigated. The resin system also showed shorter gel times than those of the PRF at different weight portions of ammonium hydroxide additions. Preliminary chemical structural analysis of both resin systems catalysed by ammonium hydroxide using Infrared (IR) analyser showed evidence for the presence of an azomethine group which indicated that the ammonia was being incorporated into the resin structure. Single layer particleboards were manufactured at low temperatures using the PRF binder and ammonia. Gaseous injection of ammonia in situ during board consolidation was achieved by using a laboratory press fitted with perforated <b>plattens.</b> An optimum pressing schedule was established whereby the ammonia was injected after the mat had reaching its final thickness in a sealed press system. The effects of pressing temperature, PRF resin loading and gas pressure on board vertical density profile, MOR, MOE, IB and thickness swell were studied. The results showed that the ammonia gas-injected boards consolidated at both temperatures of 50 C and 100 C had more uniform density profiles than those of the hot-pressed boards at the temperature of 180 C, however, the MOR, MOE, IB and thickness swell were less satisfactory. The MOR, MOE, IB and thickness swell of the ammonia gas-injected boards were bench marked against the requirements for standard grade High Moisture Resistant (HIR) particleboards in accordance with the AS/NZS 1859. 1 : Part 1 (1997), and were found to be below the acceptable standard. Particleboards bonded with PRF:PUF 50 : 50 (w/w) resin catalysed by ammonia gas were also produced. The board MOR, MOE, lB and thickness swell were less superior than those bonded with PRF, although ammonia was found to accelerate the cure of both resin systems. This was thought to be attributable to a curing reaction that was too rapid between the ammonia and the resin system. The pressing time and temperature may need to be shortened and lowered respectively for board property improvement. The effect of wood particle size on the properties of ammonia gas-injected particleboards was investigated. Large size particles were found to increase the MOR and MIE irrespective of pressing methods. However, boards made from small size particles were found to have higher lB's than those of large size particles. This was thought to be due to better gas penetration. Recommendations are provided for further work to enhance the properties of ammonia-catalysed PRF boards. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R

25|$|The lake has had {{a history}} of water level changes. Originally, it was {{essentially}} two lakes connected via a broad channel flowing through a marshy area along the north end. Prior to the dam and flooding much of area was forest and swamp land. The lake was flooded approximately ten feet when William Purdy and his sons dammed the Scugog River at Lindsay (Upstream from the current dam and locks) in 1834 to power his grist mill. During this period of high water levels through the mid-thirties, today's so-called islands of Washburn, Nonquon (now Seven Mile), Ball, <b>Platten,</b> and the enormous centrally located Scugog came into existence as islands. Today, these form part of the mainland, with the exception of Scugog Island, which is generally maintained as an island by man-made channels around the swampy south end of the island.|$|E

2500|$|Newer wood drying {{technologies}} {{have included the}} use of reduced atmospheric pressure to attempt {{to speed up the}} drying process. [...] A variety of vacuum technologies exist, varying primarily in the method heat is introduced into the wood charge. [...] Hot water <b>platten</b> vacuum kilns use aluminum heating plates with the water circulating within as the heat source, and typically operate at significantly reduced absolute pressure. [...] Discontinuous and SSV (super-heated steam) use atmosphere to introduce heat into the kiln charge. [...] Discontinuous technology allows the entire kiln charge to come up to full atmospheric pressure, the air in the chamber is then heated, and finally vacuum is pulled. [...] SSV run at partial atmospheres (typically around 1/3 of full atmospheric pressure) in a hybrid of vacuum and conventional kiln technology (SSV kilns are significantly more popular in Europe where the locally harvested wood is easier to dry versus species found in North America). [...] RF/V (radio frequency + vacuum) kilns use microwave radiation to heat the kiln charge, and typically have the highest operating cost due to the heat of vaporization being provided by electricity rather than local fossil fuel or waste wood sources.|$|E
