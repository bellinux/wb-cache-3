5|$|In 1847 Staunton {{published}} {{his most famous}} work, The Chess-Player's Handbook, which is still in print. It contained over 300 <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> opening analysis, and almost 100 <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> endgame analysis. Modern endgame tablebases confirm Staunton's assessments of both endgames. Staunton's Handbook was based on Bilguer and von der Lasa's Handbuch des Schachspiels (first published in 1843), but enhanced by many variations and analyses of Staunton's own. His book The Chess-Player's Companion followed in 1849.|$|E

5|$|The lavish {{illumination}} programme is {{far greater}} than any other surviving Insular Gospel book. There are ten surviving full-page illuminations including two evangelist portraits, three pages with the four evangelist symbols, a carpet page, a miniature of the Virgin and Child, a miniature of Christ enthroned, and miniatures of the Arrest of Jesus and the Temptation of Christ. There are thirteen surviving full <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> decorated text including pages {{for the first few}} words of each of the Gospels. Eight of the ten <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> the canon tables have extensive decoration. It is highly probable that there were other <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> miniature and decorated text that are now lost. In addition to these major pages, there are a host of smaller decorations and decorated initials throughout the text; in fact only two pages have no decoration.|$|E
5|$|The {{publication}} of works on archaeology and art {{followed the same}} pattern as with works on physical and natural sciences: that of an itinerary with descriptions of the roads travelled, noteworthy monuments along these routes and descriptions of their destinations. Hence, volume I of Expédition de Morée. Section des Beaux Arts describes Navarino (pp.1–7) with six <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> plates (fountains, churches, the fortress of Navarino and the palace of Nestor at Pylos); then on pages 9–10, the Navarino-Methoni road is detailed with four <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> plates (a church in ruins and its frescoes, but also bucolic landscapes reminding the reader that the scene is not so far from Arcadia); and finally three pages on Methoni and four <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> plates. The bucolic landscapes were rather close to the “norm” that Hubert Robert had proposed for depictions of Greece.|$|E

5|$|Drake is a playable {{character}} in PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.
