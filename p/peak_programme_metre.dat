50|$|True <b>peak</b> <b>programme</b> meter. This {{shows the}} peak {{level of the}} {{waveform}} no matter how brief its duration.|$|R
50|$|A <b>peak</b> <b>programme</b> meter (PPM) is an {{instrument}} used in professional audio {{to indicate the}} level of an audio signal.|$|R
50|$|Over-sampling <b>peak</b> <b>programme</b> meter. This is {{a sample}} PPM {{in which the}} signal has first been over-sampled, {{typically}} {{by a factor of}} four, to alleviate the problem with a basic sample PPM.|$|R
50|$|In {{broadcasting}} equipment, this is {{termed the}} Maximum Permitted Level, which {{is defined by}} European Broadcasting Union standards. These devices use <b>peak</b> <b>programme</b> meters instead of VU meters, which gives the reading a different meaning.|$|R
50|$|Sample <b>peak</b> <b>programme</b> meter (SPPM). This is a PPM {{for digital}} audio—which shows only peak sample values, not the true {{waveform}} peaks (which may fall between samples and {{be up to}} 3 dB higher in amplitude). It may have either a 'true' or a 'quasi' integration characteristic.|$|R
50|$|Quasi <b>peak</b> <b>programme</b> meter (QPPM). This only {{shows the}} true {{level of the}} peak if it exceeds a certain duration, {{typically}} a few milliseconds. On peaks of shorter duration, it indicates less than the true peak level. The extent of the shortfall {{is determined by the}} 'integration time'.|$|R
50|$|Loudness {{monitoring}} of programme levels {{is needed in}} radio and television broadcasting, {{as well as in}} audio post production. Traditional methods of measuring signal levels, such as the <b>Peak</b> <b>programme</b> meter and VU meter, do not give the subjectively valid measure of loudness that many would argue is needed to optimise the listening experience when changing channels or swapping disks.|$|R
50|$|Programme level {{refers to}} the signal level that an audio source is {{transmitted}} or recorded at, and is important in audio if listeners of Compact Discs (CDs), radio and television are {{to get the best}} experience, without excessive noise in quiet periods or distortion of loud sounds. Programme level is often measured using a <b>peak</b> <b>programme</b> meter or a VU meter.|$|R
50|$|The {{department}} {{as it stands}} today was formed in 1993 from the merger of the BBC Designs Department and the BBC Research Department. From 2006 to 2008 it was known as Research and Innovation but has since reverted to its original name. BBC Research & Development has made major contributions to broadcast technology, carrying out original research in many areas, and developing items like the <b>peak</b> <b>programme</b> meter (PPM) which {{became the basis for}} many world standards.|$|R
5000|$|In about 1936 and 1937, German {{broadcasters}} {{developed a}} <b>peak</b> <b>programme</b> meter with a mirror galvanometer {{known as a}} [...] "Lichtzeigerinstrument" [...] (light pointer) for the display. The system consisted of a drive amplifier (e.g., ARD types U21 and U71) and a separate display unit (e.g., ARD types J47 and J48). A stereo version, known as a [...] "Doppel-Lichtzeigerinstrument" [...] contained two mirror galvanometer displays in a single housing. Such displays were still used until the 1970s, when solid-state bargraph displays became the norm.|$|R
50|$|In {{audio quality}} measurement, {{quasi-peak}} rectifiers are specified in several standards. For example ITU-R 468 noise weighting uses a special rectifier incorporating two cascaded charging time constants. The PPM or <b>peak</b> <b>programme</b> meter {{used to measure}} programme levels is actually a quasi-peak reading meter, again with precisely defined dynamics. Flutter measurement also involves a standardised quasi-peak reading meter. In every case the dynamics are chosen to reflect the sensitivity of human hearing to brief sounds, ignoring those so brief {{that we do not}} perceive them, and weighting those of intermediate duration according to audibility.|$|R
50|$|In {{professional}} usage, where consistent level {{measurements are}} needed across an industry, audio level meters often {{comply with a}} detailed formal standard. This ensures that all compliant meters indicate the same level for a given audio signal. The principal standard for PPMs is IEC 60268-10. It describes two different quasi-PPM designs that have roots in meters originally developed in the 1930s for the AM radio broadcasting networks of Germany (Type I) and the United Kingdom (Type II). The term <b>Peak</b> <b>Programme</b> Meter usually refers to these IEC-specified types and similar designs. Though originally designed for monitoring analogue audio signals, these PPMs are now also used with digital audio.|$|R

30|$|Under its mandate, the Ecotox Centre organizes further {{education}} courses—mostly two 2 -day courses per year. Topics range from “Introduction to Ecotoxicology” to “Science for the Regulation of Nanomaterials” and “Multiple Stressors—Effects of Chemicals and Environmental Factors on Organisms and Ecosystems”. Recently, 1 -day training courses were established to transfer specific skills (e.g. deriving environmental quality standards) to environmental professionals, and the Centre regularly contributes to advanced education programmes at universities, especially universities of applied sciences. In this, it collaborates frequently with its “sister institution”, the Swiss Centre for Applied Human Toxicology (SCAHT 7). The courses are advertised {{directly by the}} Ecotox Centre, {{as well as through}} Eawag’s <b>PEAK</b> <b>programme</b> and the {{further education}} programme at the University of Lausanne. Depending on the topic, the majority of course participants come from private industry, cantonal agencies, federal agencies and academia. The remaining contingent consists of members of professional and non-profit (primarily environmental) organizations and private persons.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} non-Olympic {{distances}} will be raced, {{in addition to}} a full Olympic <b>programme.</b> The 50 <b>metre</b> sprint in backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly will be held for both genders, the 800 metre freestyle for men, the 1500 metre freestyle for women and mixed gender 4 x 100 metre relays, both freestyle and medley.|$|R

50|$|The men's 100 metre {{freestyle}} {{was one of}} six swimming {{events on}} the swimming at the 1908 Summer Olympics programme. It was the shortest of the three individual freestyle events, as the 50 yard freestyle had been dropped after its one appearance on the 1904 Summer Olympics <b>programme.</b> The 100 <b>metre</b> event was contested {{for the third time}} after it had been held at the 1896 and 1906 Olympics. The 1904 Olympics saw a 100-yard event. The competition was held on Friday July 17, 1908 and Monday July 20, 1908.|$|R

5000|$|The {{film was}} heavily {{promoted}} by ITV before its first broadcast at 9:00pm on 9 September 2002, but attracted {{a relatively small}} audience for a <b>peak</b> time <b>programme.</b> Overnight figures suggested 6 million viewers had tuned in to watch A Is for Acid, a figure beaten by an episode of Waking the Dead {{which appeared in the}} same time slot on BBC One. A review in the Manchester Evening News the day after the film was shown was generally favourable: [...] "Clunes might seem an unlikely choice for this sinister and demanding role...but he acquitted tremendously in his portrayal of the beaming, oily trickster with a murderous heart...Clunes made the killer plausible, disarming and businesslike as he went about murdering for profit." [...] However, the reviewer was critical of the film's lack of tension and its failure to analyse Haigh's psyche.|$|R

5|$|Dumped {{received}} {{relatively low}} viewing figures for a <b>peak</b> time <b>programme</b> on a terrestrial channel. The first {{episode of the}} programme received just 2.4 million viewers, 10% of the audience, compared to the television premiere of The Queen on ITV1 which was watched {{by an average of}} 7.9 million people and attracted a 36% audience share. Coming Down the Mountain, also airing at the same time on BBC One, was watched by 4.7 million and a 20% share. The second episode was watched by 1.7 million, compared to the 3.6 million that watched the opening episode of the third series of ITV1's Hell's Kitchen. The penultimate episode was viewed by 1.5 million viewers and had a 7% audience share, while Hell's Kitchen received 3.4 million viewers and a 15% audience share. The final episode of the programme attracted 1.9 million viewers and an audience share of 8%, while 4.2 million viewed Hell's Kitchen, a 19% audience share. Both programmes were beaten in their slot by BBC One's Traffic Cops, which attracted 5.5 million and a 25% share of the audience.|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of psychological skills for athletes’ performance {{has been a}} major focus in the field of sport psychology the last decades. This study has aimed to investigate the effects of an internetbased psychological skills programme on coactive elite athletes. The <b>programme,</b> <b>PEAK,</b> was based on CBT techniques with six different modules including thoughts, mindfulness and goal-setting. 70 athletes were randomized into two groups, PEAK (n= 35) and waitlist (n= 35). No significant results were found on the outcome variables ASCI- 28, OMSAT- 3, mCSAI- 2 (conf), PSQ and MAAS. However, a trend was found on the subscales mCSAI- 2 (cog) and mCSAI- 2 (som). The qualitative data showed positive attitudes towards the programme.

40|$|Health, housing, {{and energy}} {{policies}} to address hot weather and heatwaves are typically based on divided &# 039;technical&# 039; and &# 039;behavioural&# 039; strategies {{and tend to}} be developed in isolation. This approach results in conflicting outcomes both within and across public policies, potentially leaving households more vulnerable to heat. The cooling practices of Australian householders are analysed using social practice theory to highlight inherent contradictions and tensions in current policies. A range of successful adaptive strategies is identified in participants of a dynamic <b>peak</b> pricing electricity <b>programme</b> or residents of an eco-living development without air-conditioning. The findings demonstrate how householders&# 039; {{ability to respond to}} heat is shaped by the elements of cooling practices, including common understandings about air-conditioners, practical knowledge and available housing infrastructures. There is a critical need to move towards a coordinated, multi-pronged and flexible public policy response framed around the dynamic cooling practices of households. This requires policies that prioritize and support adaptive cooling infrastructures, and that recognize, support and share householders&# 039; existing adaptive capacity to respond to heat...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{examined}} the relationship between GH concentrations and free insulin concentrations, used as an index of insulin sensitivity, before and after recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (RhIGF-I) administration in adolescents with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Growth hormone concentrations were assessed by a <b>peak</b> detection <b>programme</b> (Pulsar) on a control night (2000 h- 0800 h) and a night when rhIGF-I administered in a subcutaneous dose of 40 micrograms/kg at 1800 h to 16 adolescent subjects. Stable euglycaemia was maintained by a continuous intravenous insulin infusion and changes in free insulin levels on the two nights were compared with growth hormone data. RESULTS: Mean overnight GH concentrations (2000 h- 0800 h) on the control night were positively related to glycated haemoglobin (Hba 1) concentrations (r = 0. 63; P < 0. 01) and were reduced following rhIGF-I administration (24. 9 +/- 3. 6 mU/I on the control night versus 17. 4 +/- 2. 2 mU/I after administration, P = 0. 01). The mean GH pulse amplitude on the control night was related to the change in GH levels after rhIGF-I (rs = - 0. 66, P < 0. 001). Multiple regression analysis revealed that mean GH pulse amplitude was the only determinant of free insulin concentrations (0500 h- 0700 h on both study nights (P < 0. 01). The percentage change in mean growth hormone pulse amplitude between the two nights was related to the percentage reduction in free insulin concentrations (r = 0. 53, P = 0. 03). CONCLUSIONS: Growth hormone pulse amplitude is related to early morning insulin sensitivity in adolescents with IDDM on control nights and after rhIGF-I administration. The reduction in insulin levels following rhIGF-I may be linked to the change in GH pulse amplitude and not just to direct insulin-like actions. Individuals with the higher GH (and thus HbA 1 levels) were most sensitive to the GH-suppressive effects of rhIGF-I...|$|R
40|$|Objective LV {{longitudinal}} strain, a recognised {{marker of}} LV function, has been recently {{applied to the}} evaluation of the athlete's heart. At present, {{little is known about the}} influence of training on LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) in athletes. The aim of this study was to prospectively investigate the impact of training on LV longitudinal strain and twist mechanics in a cohort of competitive athletes. Methods Ninety-one competitive athletes, practising team sports and competing at national or international level, were analysed. Echocardiographic evaluation was performed at the beginning of the season (low training) and after 18 ± 2 weeks of a supervised, intensive training <b>programme</b> (<b>peak</b> training). Results A significant increase in LV mass (p< 0. 0001), LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume (p= 0. 0001 and < 0. 0001, respectively) was found at peak training. LV basal and apical torsion (p= 0. 59 and 0. 43, respectively) and LV twisting (p= 0. 78) did not change, and only a mild increase in LV GLS was evident after training (p= 0. 044). Resting heart rate was identified as the only independent predictor of LV GLS after training (β= 0. 30, p= 0. 005). Conclusions A 18 -week, intensive training programme induced only a slight increase in LV GLS despite marked changes in cardiac morphology, suggesting a physiological adaptation of the LV to exercise conditioning...|$|R
40|$|Peak {{demand has}} been a growing problem for both {{security}} of supply and cost of generation and transmission. International research has attributed a significant influence of human behaviour on home energy for homes with similar households and appliances. Demand side management has had many successful programmes aimed at managing demand growth and load shape. The energy management strategy, “Demand Response”, aims to achieve peak energy demand reduction by eliciting behaviour change. Demand Response management encompasses energy needs analysis, information provision to customers, behaviour induction, smart meter technology, and new signalling and feedback concepts for residential customers. There is concern that pricing mechanisms alone may impact negatively on lower-socio economic households. This paper reviews the two main strategies {{that have been used}} to reduce residential demand for electricity at peak times, direct load control and variable pricing. The current research program studies residential energy activities during winter morning and evening peaks and possible behaviour modifications to manage peak demand. This paper reports the demand response to three different signals: price, environmental impact, and risk of black-outs. The results show that demand response could effectively be achieved by focusing on normal energy use activities at peak times and the behaviour of the members of households during <b>peak</b> hours. A <b>programme</b> to develop the necessary technology and provide credible information and understandable signals about risks and consequences could reliably provid...|$|R
