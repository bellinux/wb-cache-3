500|$|The Analecta Ordinis Fratrum Praedicatorum {{claims that}} he was [...] "a Scot by birth", {{and that he was}} {{admitted}} into the Dominican Order of Paris in 1219. The latter source, however, is often highly unreliable, and cannot be fully trusted. The historian Archie Duncan was cautious about a date as firm and early as 1221, and wrote that Clement [...] "had entered the Dominican order by the later 1220s". Although [...] "Clement" [...] is neither a Scottish nor an English name, the large number of French-speakers in both Scotland and England during this <b>period</b> <b>means</b> that this consideration carries limited weight; indeed [...] "Clement" [...] need not even have been his birth-name. The diocese of Dunblane was entirely Gaelic-speaking in Clement's day, and in this era it was often frowned upon for a bishop to be ignorant of the language of his diocese. If this had been a consideration in Clement's later appointment, then this would strongly suggest that Clement was in fact a Scot. It is worth adding that Clement was later noted for his skill in languages. Clement received his university education at either the University of Oxford or the University of Paris, perhaps at both of these institutions. There is a possibility that he can be identified more fully as [...] "Clement Rocha". A [...] "Father Clement Rocha" [...] was the owner of a manuscript from the period now held in Edinburgh. This, however, says nothing more about his background.|$|E

However, the limited choice of metals in this <b>period</b> <b>means</b> {{that he has}} to use copper as the braking medium acting on the disc. The poor state of the roads at this time — no more than dusty, rough tracks — means that the copper wears quickly, making the disc brake system non-viable. It is not until 1929, in the same city that manufacturers Girling and New Hudson further develop disc brakes, which are very successful on racing cars from the early 1950s to the 1970s. Girling brakes have the quirk of using natural rubber (later nitrile) seals. Girling still manufacture disc brakes in Birmingham today.|$|E
2500|$|Lyric in European {{literature}} of the medieval or Renaissance <b>period</b> <b>means</b> a poem written {{so that it could}} be set to music—whether or not it actually was. A poem's particular structure, function, or theme might all vary. The lyric poetry of Europe in this period was created by the pioneers of courtly poetry and courtly love largely without reference to the classical past. The troubadors, travelling composers and performers of songs, began to flourish {{towards the end of the}} 11th century and were often imitated in successive centuries. [...] Trouvères were poet-composers who were roughly contemporary with and influenced by the troubadours but who composed their works in the northern dialects of France. The first known trouvère was Chrétien de Troyes (fl.1160s–80s). The dominant form of German lyric poetry in the period was the minnesang, [...] "a love lyric based essentially on a fictitious relationship between a knight and his high-born lady". Initially imitating the lyrics of the French troubadours and trouvères, minnesang soon established a distinctive tradition. There was also a large body of medieval Galician-Portuguese lyric. Hebrew singer-poets of the Middle Ages included Yehuda Halevi, Solomon ibn Gabirol, and Abraham ibn Ezra.|$|E

2500|$|Given {{the fact}} that these pieces have not been found {{elsewhere}} in Hunnic domains, we can infer that they were not considered acceptable currency outside of the Kashmir Smast region. [...] However, imitating the coins of the contemporary rulers of Gandhara, and employing certain of their dynastic symbols and portraits, alongside a totally new set of portraits, names / titles, and symbols, may indicate that while they were issued independently for use in the local kingdom, the local rulers must have paid homage to and acknowledged their Hunnic overlords. [...] The fact that they were allowed to use some of their own tamghas and titles and that the greater chiefs gave them the privilege of minting their own currency strengthens this argument. [...] The minting of coins was a prerogative of the rulers, and carried with it a certain degree of governing authority. [...] Numismatically speaking, this can be likened to the period of Hephthalite and Turk Shahi sovereignty over Sogdiana, during which civic bronze coinage circulated alongside of silver drachms referencing a Hunnic or Turkic overlord (the Bukharkhoda).

The animals were offered a concentrate mixture (CM) along with wheat straw (WS), ammoniated wheat straw (AWS) (4 % urea at a 50 % moisture level) and hydrochloric acid treated ammoniated wheat straw (HCl-AWS) (4 % urea at a 50 % moisture level and HCl added to trap 30 % of NH 3 evolved) in groups I, II and III, respectively for an average daily gain (ADG) of 500 g. All the diets were made iso-nitrogenous by preparing three types of concentrate mixtures of different CP levels. The blood was collected from the jugular vein randomly from three animals of each group initially after 8 months post feeding and subsequently after two months interval up to 14 months of experimental feeding. Due to urea ammoniation, the CP content of WS increased from 3. 66 to 8. 51 and was further increased to 11. 35 due to the addition of HCl during urea-ammoniation of wheat straw. The cumulative <b>period</b> <b>mean</b> plasma glucose values (mg %), in group II (53. 13) were significantly (P < 0. 001) higher than those in groups I (48. 44) and III (50. 60).

The cumulative <b>period</b> <b>mean</b> values of serum albumin: globulin ratio and total protein values were not significantly different among the different groups. Serum urea and creatinine values were significantly (P < 0. 001) higher in group III (58. 66 and 2. 24) as compared to groups I and II. The cumulative <b>period</b> <b>mean</b> values of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (KA units) did not differ significantly, but serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) values (units*mL- 1) were significantly (P < 0. 001) higher in groups II and III than in group I. The cumulative <b>period</b> <b>mean</b> values of T 3 (ng*mL- 1) did not differ significantly among the groups, but T 4 values were significantly (P < 0. 001) higher in group III (22. 74) than in groups I (21. 41) and II (20. 89), respectively.
