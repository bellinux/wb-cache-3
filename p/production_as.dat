5|$|As a governor, Rodríguez Saá {{attracted}} huge {{investments to}} the province, {{which led to}} the growth of local industries, public works, social services and tourism. Levels of employment and industrial <b>production,</b> <b>as</b> well as measures of scholastic achievement and crime-fighting success were higher than those of the country at large. He was a populist and authoritarian governor who was accused of nepotism, corruption and restricting freedom of the press. He united the governors of the smaller Argentine provinces in a front, called Frente Federal Solidario.|$|E

By August 2014 this has increased to 1,473 MW, accounting for 27 per cent of electricity <b>production.</b> <b>As</b> of late 2015 {{there are a}} large range of new wind farms {{in various stages of}} planning but only one under construction, the Hornsdale Wind Farm.

5|$|Composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz {{began working}} on writing songs for the film from the {{beginning}} of the film's <b>production.</b> <b>As</b> the story evolved, he continued to write songs that would serve both to entertain and help move the story along. Composer Hans Zimmer arranged and produced the songs and then eventually wrote the film's score. The film's score was recorded entirely in London, England.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{budgetary}} constraints, {{the production}} {{was not able}} to shoot the remounted scenes of episode one in the north-east, and they instead had to be filmed in and around Watford. Beach-set scenes were shot at Folkestone rather than Whitley Bay, which was obvious to locals on screen due to the presence of pebbles on the beach, which are not present at Whitley. This led to some critics mockingly referring to the <b>production</b> <b>as</b> Our Friends in the South.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the production style of contemporary R at the time, which featured predominant casting of well-known record producers for an artist's project, D'Angelo handled most of the album's <b>production,</b> <b>as</b> well as contributing all of the vocals.

5|$|In {{order to}} measure {{well-being}} more generally, Amartya Sen, Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, and other feminist economists helped develop alternatives to Gross Domestic Product, {{such as the}} Human Development Index. Other models of interest to feminist economists include the labor theory of value, which was most thoroughly developed in Das Capital by Karl Marx. That model considers <b>production</b> <b>as</b> a socially constructed human project and redefines wages as means to earning a living. This refocuses economic models on human innate desires and needs as opposed to monetary incentives.|$|E
