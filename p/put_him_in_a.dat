5|$|Tange's {{interest}} in urban studies <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{good position to}} handle post war reconstruction. In the summer of 1946 he was invited by the War Damage Rehabilitation Board to put forward a proposal for certain war damaged cities. He submitted plans for Hiroshima and Maebashi. His design for an airport in Kanon, Hiroshima was accepted and built, but a seaside park in Ujina was not.|$|E
5|$|After he {{announced}} {{the building of}} the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia. He was also going blind and needed younger people to read his letters and the newspaper to him.|$|E

5|$|In November 1944 Duff Cooper was {{appointed}} British ambassador to France and was provided accommodation at the Hôtel Le Bristol, where the Wodehouses were living. Cooper {{complained to the}} French authorities, and the couple were moved to a different hotel. They were subsequently arrested by French police and placed under preventive detention, despite no charges being presented. When Muggeridge tracked them down later, {{he managed to get}} Ethel released straight away and, four days later, ensured that the French authorities declared Wodehouse unwell and <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nearby hospital, which was more comfortable than where they had been detained. While in this hospital, Wodehouse worked on his novel Uncle Dynamite.|$|E
5|$|Senator Powell favored Kentucky's {{neutrality}} policy {{during the}} Civil War, but nationally, the conflict <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tenuous political situation. On one hand, he favored a strong national {{government and a}} strict interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. On the other hand, he was an opponent of coercion, and due to Kentucky's proximity to the Southern states, maintained a more sympathetic view of the southern cause than legislators from more northern states. During his term as governor, Powell had been critical of Northern states that refused {{to abide by the}} Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Brown was {{successful}} in the tour matches when he played as an opener. He ended the tour with eight centuries {{and a total of}} 1,448 first-class runs at an average of 57.92, behind only Bradman, Hassett and Morris in the runs and averages, with a highest score of 200 against Cambridge University. Brown's tally of eight centuries was second only to Bradman, and took his tally on English soil to 18 first-class tons. Excluding the matches against Worcestershire, the MCC and the first two Tests, in which Brown had scored 25, 26, 17, 24 and 32 batting in the middle order while Barnes and Morris opened, Brown scored 1,324 runs at 66.20 while opening in the other matches, which would have <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> clear fourth place on the batting averages. Following his omission from the Test team midway through the tour, Brown batted in a slow and conservative manner in order to score more runs and regain his position, much to the chagrin of the crowds.|$|E

5|$|The {{return of}} Bond in 1981 saw media {{reports on the}} more {{politically}} correct Bond and his choice of car—a Saab 900 Turbo; Gardner later <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Bentley Mulsanne Turbo. Gardner also updated Bond's firearm: under Gardner, Bond is initially issued with the Browning 9mm before changing to a Heckler & Koch VP70 and then a Heckler & Koch P7. Bond is also revealed to have taken part in the 1982 Falklands War. Gardner updated Fleming's characters and used contemporary political leaders in his novels; he also used the high-tech apparatus of Q Branch from the films, although Jeremy Black observed that Bond is more reliant on technology than his own individual abilities. Gardner's series linked Bond to the Fleming novels rather than the film incarnations and referred to events covered in the Fleming stories.|$|E
5|$|One day at Emain Macha, Cú Chulainn overhears Cathbad {{teaching}} his pupils. One {{asks him}} what that day is auspicious for, and Cathbad replies that any warrior who takes arms that day will have everlasting fame. Cú Chulainn, though only seven years old, goes to Conchobar {{and asks for}} arms. None of the weapons given to him withstand his strength, until Conchobar gives him his own weapons. But when Cathbad sees this he grieves, because he had not finished his prophecy—the warrior who took arms that day would be famous, but his life would be short. Soon afterwards, {{in response to a}} similar prophecy by Cathbad, Cú Chulainn demands a chariot from Conchobar, and only the king's own chariot withstands him. He sets off on a foray and kills the three sons of Nechtan Scéne, who had boasted they had killed more Ulstermen than there were Ulstermen still living. He returns to Emain Macha in his battle frenzy, and the Ulstermen are afraid he will slaughter them all. Conchobar's wife Mugain leads out the women of Emain, and they bare their breasts to him. He averts his eyes, and the Ulstermen wrestle him into a barrel of cold water, which explodes from the heat of his body. They <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> second barrel, which boils, and a third, which warms to a pleasant temperature.|$|E

25|$|Congress did {{not deal}} with the problem of what to do if a President were alive but {{incapacitated}} as Garfield was. Nor did the Congress take up the question 38 years later, when Woodrow Wilson suffered a stroke that <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> coma for days and left him partially paralyzed and blind in one eye for {{the last year and a}} half of his Presidency. It was not until the Twenty-fifth Amendment was ratified in 1967 that there was an official procedure for what to do if the president became incapacitated.|$|E

This <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small group of spinners whose career averages were {{inferior}} to their performances against India, generally regarded as the best players of spin in the world. At this stage of his career, he had yet to perform consistently with bat and ball simultaneously, apart from his breakthrough series in the Caribbean. He had managed, in the 14 Tests since then, 559 runs at 27.95 and 67 wickets at 24.98.|$|E

In October 1972, the Screen Directors Guild staged a tribute to Ford and in March 1973 the American Film Institute honored him with its first Lifetime Achievement Award at a ceremony which was telecast nationwide, with President Richard Nixon promoting Ford to full Admiral and presenting him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.|$|E
