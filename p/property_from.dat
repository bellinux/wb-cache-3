GFI instead licensed the intellectual <b>property</b> <b>from</b> now-owner Codemasters.|$|E
5|$|Construction in Norway {{has always}} been {{characterized}} {{by the need to}} shelter people, animals, and <b>property</b> <b>from</b> harsh weather, including predictably cold winters and frost, heavy precipitation in certain areas, wind and storms; and {{to make the most of}} scarce building resources. Until modern times, transportation infrastructure was also primitive, and builders largely had to rely on locally available materials.|$|E

5|$|The {{demographic}} decline due to {{the plague}} had economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30 to 40% {{in most parts of}} Europe between 1350 and 1400. Landholders faced a great loss, but for ordinary men and women it was a windfall. The survivors of the plague found not only that the prices of food were cheaper but also that lands were more abundant, and many of them inherited <b>property</b> <b>from</b> their dead relatives.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Ernest Thompson {{exercised}} an option of his lease allowing him to buy Craigiehall from Lord Rosebery. However, the army had still not moved out, and in 1948 offered to purchase the <b>property</b> <b>from</b> Thompson, finally completing the sale in 1951. Through the early 1950s the Army made alterations to Craigiehall. The original roof was replaced in 1953 due to woodworm, and extra rooms added in the attic. This resulted {{in the loss of}} Bruce's chimneys, and Burn's dining room pediment. Internally the house was redecorated, it being considered that there was too little of the original scheme remaining to allow restoration. Another extension was added, this time to the north-west, to house the staff of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC) in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th century, Dinefwr Castle {{was built}} by Lord Rhys.

The family were elevated to the peerage of Great Britain as Baron Dynevor. Mary I is documented to have restored some of the land back to the Rhys family, {{but it was not}} until the reign of Charles I that the family fully regained their properties.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} 14th century, a {{house by the}} name of Capell's Court stood on the site of Linton Park. It took its name from a family of local landowners named de Capell who held the <b>property</b> <b>from</b> the late 14th century to the mid-15th century. It was then sold to the Baysden family who held it until the late 16th century, when it was sold to Sir Anthony Mayney. Mayney's {{grandson}} sold the estate to the judge Sir Francis Wythen. Wythen's daughter, Catherine, inherited the estate and, following her second marriage to Brigadier-General Sir George Jocelyn, the estate was sold to London merchant Sir Robert Mann.|$|E

Between 1977 and 1984, he accrued six more convictions {{and was sentenced}} to a care order until the age of 18 for robbery in August 1978. In January 1980 he was convicted of two further crimes including theft of <b>property</b> <b>from</b> his lodgings the night before De Simone's murder. He was subsequently convicted of a series of burglaries committed in Portsmouth for which he received an 18-month custodial sentence of which he served 9months.

5|$|In 2012 Syngenta bought Belgian RNAi firm Devgen for $522 {{million and}} Monsanto paid $29.2 {{million for the}} {{exclusive}} rights to intellectual <b>property</b> <b>from</b> Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. The International Potato Center in Lima, Peru is looking for genes to target in the sweet potato weevil, a beetle whose larvae ravage sweet potatoes globally. Other researchers are trying to silence genes in ants, caterpillars and pollen beetles. Monsanto will likely be first to market, with a transgenic corn seed that expresses dsRNA based on gene Snf7 from the western corn rootworm, a beetle whose larvae annually cause one billion dollars in damage in the United States alone. A 2012 paper showed that silencing Snf7 stunts larval growth, killing them within days. In 2013 the same team showed that the RNA affects very few other species.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to improving the}} economy, the lower social classes also had to {{be integrated into the}} new body politic, although they often got few rewards from independence. The political debate seeking answers to these questions was marked by a clash—at times on the battlefield—between liberalism and conservatism. Conservatives sought to maintain the traditional social structures in order to ensure stability; liberals sought to create a more dynamic society and economy by ending ethnically-based social distinctions and freeing <b>property</b> <b>from</b> economic restrictions. In its quest to transform society, liberals often adopted policies that were not welcome by Native communities, who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them by traditional Spanish law.|$|E
5|$|Josceline Percy, {{the last}} Percy earl, died in 1670. Two years later his widow allowed the keep's {{materials}} {{to be reused}} to build Chirton Hall. A total of 272cart-loads {{were taken from the}} keep. Josceline Percy's property passed to the Duke of Somerset through marriage. In 1698, the owners decided not to renovate Warkworth Castle after the estimate to add battlements, floors and new windows came in at £1,600. Elizabeth Seymour inherited the <b>property</b> <b>from</b> her father in 1750. Her husband, Hugh Smithson, changed his name to Hugh Percy, and the castle then descended through the Dukes of Northumberland, a dynasty he founded.|$|E
5|$|Like most of {{the smaller}} Cistercian houses, {{comparatively}} {{little is known about}} the internal history of the abbey. In its early years Cleeve received grants of land and <b>property</b> <b>from</b> local lords and the Crown to supplement its initial endowment and in the prosperous years of the thirteenth century grew steadily, reaching 26monks in 1297. The abbey held various local churches, including those at Cleeve, Queen Camel, Woolavington while also holding the rectory of Lundy. The abbey was also responsible for the chapel of Our Lady between Old Cleeve and what is now Blue Anchor; however although this has since disappeared, the inn for pilgrims attending the chapel has been expanded into the present Chapel Cleeve Manor.|$|E
