25|$|On 2 October 2014, P1 {{achieved}} a milestone {{for the project}} when it conducted its maiden flight from Mollis Airport. This first flight, lasting 20 minutes, was flown by chief test pilot Dwayne Williams. Stucki announced that the first flight had confirmed <b>preliminary</b> <b>flight</b> characteristics of the SH09. Commenting shortly after P1's maiden flight, the company stated that it was on schedule to receive EASA certification within the next 12-16 months. In summer 2015, Marenco halted flight tests after 100 flight hours to focus on producing the second prototype, P2, which incorporated a modified bearingless rotor head and new rotor blades to reduce vibrations. By September 2015, it was recognised that the original development timeline had been optimistic and that certification would take longer to achieve than had been originally announced. On 26 February 2016, P2 performed its first flight, piloted by new chief test pilot Richard Trueman. At this point, certification {{was expected to be}} achieved near to the end of 2016 or during early 2017.|$|E

2500|$|A three-part pilot {{training}} program was implemented beginning with {{two months of}} ground school, followed by <b>preliminary</b> <b>flight</b> training teaching student pilots to fly solo, and advanced flight training to qualification as a naval aviator with a commission in the Naval Reserve Flying Corps. The first ground school for pilot training was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The first class of fifty student pilots arrived on 23 July 1917 for an eight-week program covering electricity, signals, photography, seamanship, navigation, gunnery, aeronautic engines, theory of flight, and aircraft instruments. Later classes received an initial period of indoctrination and preliminary training aboard a receiving ship before assignment to ground school. Those who successfully completed ground school were transferred to naval air stations for flight training. In July 1918 parallel ground school programs began at the University of Washington in Seattle and at Dunwoody Institute in Minneapolis; but few graduates of these schools could be counted among the 18,000 naval aviation personnel who reached Europe before the war ended.|$|E
6000|$|There {{were two}} {{peculiar}} features {{in this second}} ascent. It had been doubted whether the balloon, which {{was said to be}} capable of raising four-and-a-half tons, could carry more than thirteen men. In order to set this question at rest, a short <b>preliminary</b> <b>flight</b> was made with a rope attached to restrain the [...] "Giant." [...] About thirty soldiers were then put into the car, who mounted to the extent of the rope, and were pulled down again. The other feature was that a balloon of more ordinary dimensions was let fly along with the [...] "Giant," [...] to give, by contrast, a better idea of its size. The balloon used for this purpose was the [...] "Godillot," [...] which had been used by the Emperor in the Italian campaign for reconnoitring the enemy.|$|E

40|$|Vertical {{take-off}} {{and landing}} (VTOL) aircraft has good flight characteristics and system performance without runway. The multirotor {{system has been}} tried to expand into larger size for longer endurance or higher payload. But the motor power to endurance ratio has been limited. Due to the specific energy of gasoline being much higher than battery, introducing gasoline engine into multirotor system can be considered. This paper proposes a dual power multirotor system to combine a quadrotor using gasoline engines to provide major lift in shorter arm with another quadrotor using brushless DC motors to offer most controllable force with longer arm. System design, fabrication, and verification of the proposed dual power multirotor system development are presented. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>flights</b> have achieved 16 [*]kg payload for long endurance flight.

40|$|Unmanned Aerial Vehicles {{will have}} a safe access to the Civil Airspace only when {{they will be able}} to avoid {{collisions}} even with non cooperative flying obstacles. Thus, they need to replace the capability of human eye to detect potential mid-air collisions with other airframes and the pilot expertise to find an adequate voidance trajectory. This paper deals with sensors and logics equired on-board to achieve the necessary situational awareness. n particular, it refers to the research activities carried out by the Department of Aerospace Engineering of the university of Naples “Federico II” in collaboration with the Italian Center for Aerospace Research in the framework of TECVOL project. An integrated multi-sensor system is described which is comprised of a Ka-band radar, two visible and two thermal infrared cameras, and two processing units.
