6000|$|The wood-cutter, an old man, {{was busy}} {{splitting}} a large tree into planks {{by means of}} wedges when our traveller came up. This wasteful method of obtaining planks is still practised by some natives of the South Sea Islands. Formerly the Malagasy never thought of obtaining more than two planks out of a single tree, however large the tree might be. They merely split the tree down the middle, and then chopped away the outside of each half until it was reduced to the thickness required. The advent of the English missionaries, however, {{in the early part}} of this century, introduced light in regard to the things of time as well as those of eternity-among other things, the <b>pit-saw,</b> which has taught the natives to [...] "gather up the fragments so that nothing be lost." [...] Thick planks are still however sometimes procured in the old fashion.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the first}} place, {{he was on}} what is {{sometimes}} styled a [...] "savage island"--an island that lay far out of the usual track of ships, that had only been discovered {{a little more than}} a year at that time, and was inhabited by a blood-thirsty, savage, cruel, and ignorant race of human beings, who had renounced idolatry and embraced Christianity only a few months before. They knew no more of ship-building than the celebrated man in the moon, and their methods of building canoes were quite inapplicable to vessels of large capacity. Besides this, Mr Williams was the only white man on the island, and he had no suitable implements for shipbuilding, except axes and augurs, and a few of the smaller of the carpenter's tools. In the building of a vessel, timbers and planks are indispensable, but he had no <b>pit-saw</b> wherewith to cut these. It is necessary to fasten planks and timbers together, but he had no nails to do this. Heavy iron forgings were required for some parts of the structure, but, although he possessed iron, he had no smith's anvil, or hammer, or tongs, or bellows, wherewith to forge it. In these circumstances he commenced one of the greatest pieces of work ever undertaken by man--greatest, not only because of the mechanical difficulties overcome, but because of the influence for good that the ship, when completed, had upon the natives of the Southern Seas, as well as its reflex influence in exciting admiration, emulation, and enthusiasm in other lands.|$|E

5000|$|A pit saw was {{a two-man}} rip saw. In parts of early colonial North America, {{it was one of}} the {{principal}} tools used in shipyards and other industries where water-powered sawmills were not available. It was so-named because it was typically operated over a saw pit, either at ground level or on trestles across which logs that were to be cut into boards. The pit saw was [...] "a strong steel cutting-plate, of great breadth, with large teeth, highly polished and thoroughly wrought, some eight or ten feet in length" [...] with either a handle on each end or a frame saw. A <b>pit-saw</b> was also sometimes known as a whipsaw. It took 2-4 people to operate. A [...] "pit-man" [...] stood in the pit, a [...] "top-man" [...] stood outside the pit, and they worked together to make cuts, guide the saw, and raise it. <b>Pit-saw</b> workers were among the most highly paid laborers in early colonial North America.|$|E
50|$|During the 1880s Somerset {{managed a}} New South Wales {{pastoral}} station and meatworks {{before returning to}} Queensland to purchase a property of his own. In 1888 he secured approximately 20,000 acres in the Mount Stanley area of the Brisbane Valley as a grazing farm, intending to erect his family home there. He engaged a brickmaker to start making bricks for the chimneys, and employed men to <b>pit-saw</b> pine logs brought down from the ranges. However, respecting the McConnels' wish that the two families should avoid the 19 river crossings between Cressbrook and Mount Stanley, Somerset agreed to exchange 10,000 acres of his Mount Stanley land for 5,000 acres of freehold Cressbrook land at the junction of the Brisbane and Stanley Rivers. Somerset called this property Caboonbah, derived from the Aboriginal Cabon gibba meaning big rock, describing the steep, 120 feet high bank of the Brisbane River on which Caboonbah homestead was built. The property, mostly comprising rich alluvial flats, was divided into 7 paddocks and was devoted to fattening bullocks, dairying and horse-breeding. Some sheep were also run, but eventually these were replaced by goats. In 1892 the first cattle to cross the d'Aguilar Range were a mob of fat bullocks from Caboonbah.|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{investigation was}} undertaken {{of the techniques}} (materials and technologies) used to construct the shell of the New Zealand house (envelope and interior linings) between 1792 and 1982. Using census, manufacturing and import statistics with analysis of local and international archives and publications, principal techniques were selected and documented. A review of local construction and building publications provide a background {{to the development of}} construction education and training, as well as the speed of change. Analysis of census data showed that from 1858 to 1981 the majority of dwelling walls in terms of construction (appearance) were timber, brick, board or concrete, while the structure was timber frame. Analysis of import data for seven materials (galvanised iron, asbestos cement, cement, window glass, wood nails, gypsum and roofing slate) from 1870 to 1965 found the UK was a majority supplier until 1925, except for USA gypsum. For the rest of the period, the UK continued to play a preeminent role with increasing Australian imports and local manufacture. Examination of archival and published information on techniques used for the sub-floor, floor, wall (construction and structure), fenestration, roof and thermal insulation provide an overview of country of orign, decade of arrival, spread of use and, if relevant, reasons for failure. Forty materials (including earth and brick, stone, cement and concrete, timber and ferrous metals) and twenty-four technologies are documented. Revised dates of first NZ use are provided for eight of these e. g. the shift from balloon to platform framing occurred in the early 1880 s rather than 1890 s. Three case studies examine different aspects of the techniques (nails 1860 to 1965, hollow concrete blocks 1904 to 1910 and camerated concrete 1908 to 1920). The research shows that timber was the predominant structural (framing) material from 1792 to 1982. From the 1930 s there was a shift away from timber construction (external appearance) to a wider range of products, including brick, board (asbestos- and more recently fibre-cement) and concrete. A new chronological classification of house development is proposed. These techniques travelled {{in a variety of ways}} and at speeds which indicate over this time New Zealand was technologically well connected and supported an innovative construction sector. The techniques covered are: Boards: asbestos, and cellulose fibre-cement, particle, plywood, pumice, softboard, and hardboard; Bricks: double and veneer; Building paper; Cement and lime: local and imported; Concrete: hollow block, monolithic, reinforced, Camerated, Oratonu and Pearse patents; Fired earth: bricks and terracotta roof tiles; Floors: concrete slab, suspended, and terrazzo; Framing: balloon, braced, light steel, and platform; Insulation: cork, fibreglass, macerated paper, perlite, pumice, foil, and mineral wool; Iron and Steel: cast and wrought iron, steel; Linings: fibrous plaster, plasterboard and wet; metal tile, shingles and slates; Nails: cut, hand-made, wire and plates; Piles: concrete, native timber and stone; Roof: strutted and truss rafter; Roofing: aluminium, corrugated iron,; Sub-floor: vapour barrier, walls and ventilation; Timber: air and kiln drying, glulam, native, <b>pit-saw</b> and preservative treatments; Wall constructions: earth, log, slab, solid timber, raupo and stone; Weatherboards; and Windows: glass, aluminium, steel and timber frames...|$|E

40|$|A unique {{forested area}} survives on the Usambara {{mountains}} of north-eastern Tanzania. These forests have been {{isolated from the}} Guinea-Congo rainforests {{for a very long}} period and, as a result, 25 - 30 % of plant species are endemic to the area. The forests are also home to several endemic birds, mammals and a remarkably large number of amphibians. However, many of these plant and animal species are threatened with extinction by extensive forest clearance for agriculture and timber extraction. Much of the forest was cleared in the colonial period, firstly for coffee and later for tea cultivation. Recently the tea estates have suffered from poor management and many people have abandoned work on them and have cleared forest land to practice low-grade agriculture. A particular problem has come with the growing of cardamom. The ground storey of the forest is cleared to cultivate the cardamom under the canopy. This cultivation prevents regeneration of the forest trees and when, after seven or eight years, the yields of the cardamom begin to decline, the people clear the canopy trees to plant maize, sugar cane and cassava. Large areas of forest are being destroyed in this way. Further problems have come from pit-sawers who illegally cut timber in the forests for sale, both in near-by markets and across the border in Kenya. The forest had also been the subject of industrial logging by a parastatal cooperation but this was stopped recently {{when it became clear that}} the logging was unsustainable. Since 1986 IUCN has had a project in the Usambaras funded by the EEC, which has been attempting to give more effective protection to the forest, whilst helping the local people to develop agricultural systems which will be less destructive. The project is based on a process of consultation with local communities. A locally recruited staff member is assigned to each of the thirteen villages in the East Usambaras to encourage the formation of a village development committee. Through the village coordinators the project is able to engage in a dialogue with the villagers, both to ascertain their needs and aspirations and to explain to them the long term environmental problems that will result if the forests are lost. The village committees have been encouraged to come up with their own ideas on solutions to the problem and if these ideas are felt by the project staff to be viable, support is available to help implement them. This support takes the form of the provision of agricultural tools, tree seeds and seedlings, plastic bags for tree growing, earth moving equipment to build fish ponds and fish fry to stock them, and help with transporting building materials and agricultural produce. Attempts have been made to bring the artisanal pitsawing of timber under proper control. The intention was to license villagers to <b>pit-saw</b> timber in forests adjacent to their village land. So far the difficulties in preventing outsiders from logging the forests have been so great that it has been found necessary to put a total ban on all timber extraction. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that the forest could support a moderate yield of valuable timber, which is much in demand in local towns; this could provide an incentive to the villagers to maintain forest areas. In its first three years of operation the villagers working with the project have planted 100 kilometres of boundary strips around the forest reserves and 30 hectares or communal plantations, a total of half a million trees. Five central and 168 village tree nurseries have been established. The project has helped villagers put in contour strips on a thousand farms, over an average of 1 - 2 hectares per farm and 40 fish ponds have been constructed and stocked. More importantly/here have been changes in the attitudes of the farmers. They are adopting contour terracing on a wide scale and many farmers have started to plant cloves, pepper and coffee as a source of cash. The forests of the East Usamabaras are still very much under threat. The number of people in the area is simply too great for the land resources available. But working with the villagers has resulted in increased sensitivity to conservation problems, law enforcement is much better tolerated and there is now a genuine effort being made on the part of everybody, from the small farmer to the national administration, to find ways of reconciling the needs of the peoples of me Usambaras and the need to conserve its rich flora and fauna.
