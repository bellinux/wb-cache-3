5|$|As {{knowledge}} has increased, paleontology has developed specialised subdivisions. Vertebrate paleontology concentrates on fossils of vertebrates, {{from the earliest}} fish to the immediate ancestors of modern mammals. Invertebrate paleontology deals with fossils of invertebrates such as molluscs, arthropods, annelid worms and echinoderms. Paleobotany focuses {{on the study of}} fossil plants, but traditionally includes the study of fossil algae and fungi. <b>Palynology,</b> the study of pollen and spores produced by land plants and protists, straddles the border between paleontology and botany, as it deals with both living and fossil organisms. Micropaleontology deals with all microscopic fossil organisms, regardless of the group to which they belong.|$|E
5|$|Remains of Ferugliotherium {{come from}} two {{formations}} in the Late Cretaceous of southern Argentina, the Los Alamitos and La Colonia Formations. These and the Allen Formation (which has yielded Trapalcotherium) are all dated to the Campanian (84–71 million years ago) and/or Maastrichtian (71–66 million years ago), the penultimate and ultimate {{stages of the}} Cretaceous. The La Colonia Formation may be somewhat younger than the other two, while the Los Alamitos Formation has been considered Campanian, and can be dated to the Campanian or Maastrichtian {{on the basis of}} <b>palynology.</b> The Allen Formation is likely Maastrichtian, but not latest Maastrichtian.|$|E
5|$|<b>Palynology</b> (the {{study of}} pollen), {{as well as}} studies of fossil megaflora and invertebrates, had {{initially}} suggested that the uppermost Cedar Mountain Formation – including the Mussentuchit – dated to the Albian stage. A 1997 argon-argon dating of sanidine crystals recovered from a volcanic ash layer in the upper Cedar Mountain Formation by Cifelli and colleagues indicated an age of 97 ± 0.1 million years, which was then considered to be just after {{the boundary between the}} Albian and Cenomanian stages. This is similar to the early Cenomanian age reported for the overlying Dakota Formation. Subsequently, in 2007, James Garrison and colleagues dated the volcanic ash layer passing through the Cifelli #2 Quarry – which is likely the same layer dated previously by Cifelli and colleagues – to 96.7 ± 0.5 million years ago. At an approximate level, the Cifelli and Garrison estimates agree with each other, thus indicating a Cenomanian age for Eolambia. Garrison and colleagues also re-analyzed the pollen assemblage from localities throughout the Mussentuchit, concluding that the assemblage spans the Albian-Cenomanian boundary.|$|E
25|$|<b>Palynology</b> is an {{interdisciplinary}} science {{and is a}} branch of earth science (geology or geological science) and biological science (biology), particularly plant science (botany). Stratigraphical <b>palynology</b> is a branch of micropalaeontology and paleobotany, which studies fossil palynomorphs from the Precambrian to the Holocene.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>palynology</b> was {{introduced}} by Hyde and Williams in 1944, following correspondence with the Swedish geologist Antevs, {{in the pages of}} the Pollen Analysis Circular (one of the first journals devoted to pollen analysis, produced by Paul Sears in North America). Hyde and Williams chose <b>palynology</b> on the basis of the Greek words paluno meaning 'to sprinkle' and pale meaning 'dust' (and thus similar to the Latin word pollen).|$|E
25|$|HF {{is often}} used in <b>palynology</b> to remove {{silicate}} minerals, for extraction of dinoflagellate cysts, acritarchs and chitinozoans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Palynology</b> can {{be applied}} to {{problems}} in many fields including geology, botany, paleontology, archaeology, pedology (soil study), and physical geography.|$|E
25|$|Other {{researches}} also {{cover the}} fields of <b>palynology</b> (pollen study), geochemistry, hydrogeology and the physical conditions prevailing in the Cave of Crystals.|$|E
25|$|Palaeoecology {{and climate}} change. <b>Palynology</b> {{can be used}} to {{reconstruct}} past vegetation (land plants) and marine and freshwater phytoplankton communities, and so infer past environmental (palaeoenvironmental) and palaeoclimatic conditions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Palynology</b> {{also allows}} {{scientists}} to infer the climatic conditions from the vegetation present {{in an area}} thousands or millions of years ago. This is a fundamental part of research into climate change.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{distribution}} of acritarchs, chitinozoans, dinoflagellate cysts, pollen and spores provides evidence of stratigraphical correlation through biostratigraphy and palaeoenvironmental reconstruction, one common and lucrative application of <b>palynology</b> is in oil and gas exploration.|$|E
25|$|<b>Palynology</b> is {{the study}} of {{contemporary}} and fossil palynomorphs, including pollen. <b>Palynology</b> is used to infer the geographical distribution of plant species, which vary under different climate conditions. Different groups of plants have pollen with distinctive shapes and surface textures, and since the outer surface of pollen is composed of a very resilient material, they resist decay. Changes in the type of pollen found in different layers of sediment in lakes, bogs, or river deltas indicate changes in plant communities. These changes are often a sign of a changing climate. As an example, palynological studies have been used to track changing vegetation patterns throughout the Quaternary glaciations and especially since the last glacial maximum.|$|E
25|$|Micropaleontology can {{be roughly}} {{divided into four}} areas of study {{on the basis of}} {{microfossil}} composition: (a) calcareous, as in coccoliths and foraminifera, (b) phosphatic, as in the study of some vertebrates, (c) siliceous, as in diatoms and radiolaria, or (d) organic, as in the pollen and spores studied in <b>palynology.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Blytt-Sernander {{classification}}, or sequence, is {{a series}} of north European climatic periods or phases based on the study of Danish peat bogs by Axel Blytt (1876) and Rutger Sernander (1908). The classification was incorporated into a sequence of pollen zones later defined by Lennart von Post, {{one of the founders of}} <b>palynology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tan {{lines on}} her upper body led {{investigators}} {{to believe that}} she had come to the Caledonia area from a distant, warmer locale. While most evidence at the scene had been washed away by heavy rain that night, forensic <b>palynology,</b> or the analysis of pollen on her clothing, suggested she had spent time in Florida, southern California, Arizona or northern Mexico prior to her death. Later analysis of isotopes in her bones lent further support to this geographic clue.|$|E
25|$|At a {{basic level}} of analysis, {{artifacts}} found are cleaned, catalogued and compared to published collections. This comparison process often involves classifying them typologically and identifying other sites with similar artifact assemblages. However, {{a much more}} comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through archaeological science, meaning that artifacts can be dated and their compositions examined. Bones, plants, and pollen collected from a site can all be analyzed using the methods of zooarchaeology, paleoethnobotany, and <b>palynology,</b> while any texts can usually be deciphered.|$|E
25|$|Pollen's sporopollenin {{outer sheath}} affords it some {{resistance}} to the rigours of the fossilisation process that destroy weaker objects; it is also produced in huge quantities. There is an extensive fossil record of pollen grains, often disassociated from their parent plant. The discipline of <b>palynology</b> {{is devoted to the}} study of pollen, which can be used both for biostratigraphy and to gain information about the abundance and variety of plants alive — which can itself yield important information about paleoclimates. Pollen is first found in the fossil record in the late Devonian period and increases in abundance until the present day.|$|E
25|$|Developments {{in other}} fields of science: DNA {{analysis}} has had an impact in various areas of history either confirming established historical theories or presenting new evidence that undermines the current established historical explanation. Professor Andrew Sherratt, a British prehistorian, was responsible for introducing the work of anthropological writings on the consumption of currently legal and illegal drugs {{and how to use}} these papers to explain certain aspects of prehistoric societies. Carbon dating, the examination of ice cores and tree rings, <b>palynology,</b> SEM analysis of early metal samples, and measuring oxygen isotopes in bones, have all provided new data in the last few decades with which to argue new hypotheses. Extracting ancient DNA allows scientists to argue whether or not humans are partly descended from Neanderthals.|$|E
25|$|Pollen {{is a fine}} to coarse powdery {{substance}} comprising pollen grains which are male microgametophytes of seed plants, which produce male gametes (sperm cells). Pollen grains have a hard coat made of sporopollenin that protects the gametophytes {{during the process of}} their movement from the stamens to the pistil of flowering plants or from the male cone to the female cone of coniferous plants. If pollen lands on a compatible pistil or female cone, it germinates, producing a pollen tube that transfers the sperm to the ovule containing the female gametophyte. Individual pollen grains are small enough to require magnification to see detail. The study of pollen is called <b>palynology</b> and is highly useful in paleoecology, paleontology, archaeology, and forensics.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, {{the sixteen}} natural history {{collections}} at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge were {{designated by the}} state legislature as the Louisiana Museum of Natural History. Together, these collections hold {{a total of more}} than 2.8 million specimens, objects, and artifacts that document the rich natural history of Louisiana. These collections are dispersed among six independently administered units on campus, and include the Vascular Plant Herbarium, the Mycological Herbarium, the Lichen Herbarium, the Louisiana State Arthropod Museum, the <b>Palynology</b> Collection, the Mineralogy and Petrology Collections, the Textile and Costume Museum, the Louisiana Geological Survey Log Library and Core Repository, and, within the LSU Museum of Natural Science, the Collection of Amphibians and Reptiles, the Collection of Birds, the Collection of Fishes, the Collection of Genetic Resources, the Collection of Mammals, the Vertebrate Paleontology Collection, the Collection of Microfossils and Invertebrates, and the Anthropological and Ethnological Collections.|$|E
500|$|Besides DNA testing, {{authorities}} conducted efforts into forensic <b>palynology</b> {{as well as}} isotope {{examination of}} water found at the scene. Results of the testing indicated that the child had spent time in the local, urban area, most likely in Boston, as traces of both pine and soot were found through the tests. Eventually, it was also determined {{that she may have}} spent time in [...] "any [...] New England" [...] state and possibly others. The hair and enamel tests also indicated she could have [...] "moved across the country." ...|$|E
500|$|Plant {{responses}} to climate {{and other environmental}} changes can inform {{our understanding of how}} these changes affect ecosystem function and productivity. For example, plant phenology can be a useful proxy for temperature in historical climatology, and the biological impact of climate change and global warming. <b>Palynology,</b> the analysis of fossil pollen deposits in sediments from thousands or millions of years ago allows the reconstruction of past climates. Estimates of atmospheric [...] concentrations since the Palaeozoic have been obtained from stomatal densities and the leaf shapes and sizes of ancient land plants. Ozone depletion can expose plants to higher levels of ultraviolet radiation-B (UV-B), resulting in lower growth rates. Moreover, information from studies of community ecology, plant systematics, and taxonomy is essential to understanding vegetation change, habitat destruction and species extinction.|$|E
500|$|The Romans' {{part in the}} {{clearances}} of {{the once}} extensive Caledonian forest remains a matter of debate. That these forests were once considerably more extensive {{than they are now}} is not in dispute, but the timing and causes of the reduction are. The 16th-century writer Hector Boece believed that the woods in Roman times stretched north from Stirling into Atholl and Lochaber and was inhabited by white bulls with [...] "crisp and curland mane, like feirs lionis". Later historians such as P. F. Tytler and W. F. Skene followed suit as did the 20th-century naturalist Frank Fraser Darling. Modern techniques, including <b>palynology</b> and dendrochronology suggest a more complex picture. Changing post-glacial climates may have allowed for a maximum forest cover between 4000 and 3000 and deforestation of the Southern uplands, caused both climatically and anthropogenically, was well underway by the time the legions arrived. Extensive analyses of Black Loch in Fife suggest that arable land spread at the expense of forest from about 2000 until the 1st-century Roman advance. Thereafter, there was re-growth of birch, oak and hazel for a period of five centuries, suggesting the invasions had a very negative impact on the native population. The situation outside the Roman-held areas is harder to assess, but the long-term influence of Rome may not have been substantial.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Palynology</b> is {{used for}} a diverse range of applications, related to many {{scientific}} disciplines: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{study of}} organic microfossils is called <b>palynology.</b> Organic microfossils include pollen, spores, chitinozoans (thought {{to be the}} egg cases of marine invertebrates), scolecodonts ("worm" [...] jaws), acritarchs, dinoflagellate cysts, and fungal remains.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, {{after the}} 2005 {{exhumation}} of the body, forensic <b>palynology</b> {{was conducted on}} the clothing worn by the victim. Paul Chambers, a recently hired investigator in the Monroe County, New York medical examiner's office asked for and received permission to send her clothing to the <b>Palynology</b> Laboratory at Texas A University. Among the types of pollen found on the clothing by the Texas A University researchers were grains from Casuarina (Australian pine, or [...] "she oak"), Quercus (oak), Picea (spruce), and Betula (birch). The clothing pollen grains were compared to a control sample of pollen grains taken directly from the rural New York site where the body had been found in 1979.|$|E
2500|$|Archaeological <b>palynology</b> {{examines}} human uses {{of plants}} in the past. This can help determine seasonality of site occupation, {{presence or absence of}} agricultural practices or products, and 'plant-related activity areas' within an archaeological context. [...] Bonfire Shelter is one such example of this application.|$|E
2500|$|Truswell's {{career has}} focused on the field of <b>palynology,</b> with a large part devoted to {{understanding}} Antarctica’s floral history. She developed several novel methods for investigating sub-ice geology via the distribution of recycled pollen spores, [...] leading to her election as a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 1985.|$|E
2500|$|A palynofacies is the {{complete}} assemblage {{of organic matter}} and palynomorphs in a fossil deposit. The study of the palynofacies of a [...] depositional environment of sediments {{can be used to}} learn about the depositional palaeoenvironments of sedimentary rocks. The term palynofacies was introduced by the French geologist André Combaz in 1964. Palynofacies studies are often linked to investigations of the <b>palynology</b> and organic geochemistry of sedimentary rocks.|$|E
2500|$|Dickinson Hall, {{opened in}} 1971, {{is located on}} Museum Road.

It also houses a state-of-the-art Molecular Systematics and Evolutionary Genetics lab.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Palynology</b> is the [...] "study of dust" [...] (from Greek παλύνω, palunō, [...] "strew, sprinkle" [...] and -logy) or [...] "particles {{that are}} strewn". A classic {{palynologist}} analyses particulate samples {{collected from the}} air, from water, or from deposits including sediments of any age. The condition and identification of those particles, organic and inorganic, give the palynologist clues to the life, environment, and energetic conditions that produced them.|$|E
2500|$|The term is {{sometimes}} narrowly {{used to refer}} to a subset of the discipline, which is defined as [...] "the study of microscopic objects of macromolecular organic composition (i.e., compounds of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen), not capable of dissolution in hydrochloric or hydrofluoric acids". It is the science that studies contemporary and fossil palynomorphs, including pollen, spores, orbicules, dinocysts, acritarchs, chitinozoans and scolecodonts, together with particulate organic matter (POM) and kerogen found in sedimentary rocks and sediments. <b>Palynology</b> does not include diatoms, foraminiferans or other organisms with siliceous or calcareous exoskeletons.|$|E
