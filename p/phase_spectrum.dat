50|$|According to the duplex theory, ITDs have {{a greater}} {{contribution}} to the localisation of low frequency sounds (below 1 kHz), while ILDs {{are used in the}} localisation of high frequency sound. These approaches can be applied to selective reconstructions of spatialized signals, where spectrotemporal components believed to be dominated by the desired sound source are identified and isolated through the Short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Modern systems typically compute the STFT of the incoming signal from two or more microphones, and estimate the ITD or each spectrotemporal component by comparing the phases of the STFTs. An advantage to this approach is that it may be generalized to more than two microphones, which can improve accuracy in 3 dimensions and remove the front-back localization ambiguity that occurs with only two ears or microphones. Another advantage is that the ITD is relatively strong and easy to obtain without biomimetic instruments such as dummy heads and artificial pinnae, though these may still beused to enhance amplitude disparities.HRTF phase response is mostly linear and listeners are insensitive to the details of the interaural <b>phase</b> <b>spectrum</b> as long as the interaural time delay (ITD) of the combined low-frequency part of the waveform is maintained.|$|E

The three main points of the review are: (i) a signal can be reconstructed to within a scale factor from its <b>phase</b> <b>spectrum,</b> (ii) a signal cannot be reconstructed to within a scale factor from its magnitude spectrum, and (iii) a signal can be reconstructed to within a scale factor from its magnitude spectrum when the phase-sign (i. e., one bit of <b>phase</b> <b>spectrum</b> information) is known. Through a number of illustrative examples, we first demonstrate how the algorithms work when the spectral information is determined over the entire duration of the signal.
