The conditions measured for the single-rotation tractor configuration include two different blade angles and two propeller advance ratios, and for the counter-rotation propeller configuration include both <b>pusher</b> and <b>tractor</b> mounts. The measurements show the increasing slipstream velocities and contraction with increasing blade angle and with decreasing advance ratios.

5000|$|... "E" [...] series engines were {{designed}} for remote gearbox applications using crankshaft-speed extension shafts and remote 1.8:1 gearboxes with SAE #60 hollow propeller shafts. The military models were V-1710-6, -17, -31, 35, -37, -47, -59, -63, -83, -85, -93, -103, -109, -117, -125, -127, -129, -133,-135 and -137, producing [...] at 3000 rpm. Supercharger gear ratios were: 6.44:1, 7.48:1, 8.10:1, 8.80:1 and 9.6:1 depending on altitude rating. These engines were a complete redesign, and did not share many components with the earlier engine series. Almost all components were interchangeable with later series engines and the V-3420, and could be assembled as right hand or left hand turning engines in either <b>pusher</b> or <b>tractor</b> applications.|$|R
50|$|The AC-3 was a high-wing semicantilever {{monoplane}} {{of mixed}} construction. It was fabric {{covered with a}} conventional tail unit. It had three open cockpits, one in the nose for a gunner or observer, one forward of the wing for a pilot, {{and one on the}} upper rear fuselage for a rear gunner. An unconventional engine layout had two 447 kW (600 hp) Hispano-Suiza inline piston engines in tandem supported on eight struts above the fuselage. The installation had to be high enough to allow clearance for the two (one <b>pusher,</b> one <b>tractor)</b> propellers above the fuselage. A hatch in the port side allowed cargo or troops to be carried in the main cabin.|$|R
50|$|Typical ballast tractor {{configurations}} employ {{an independent}} drawbar trailer, modular wheel-trailer units, or dolly trailer. An advantage of using ballast tractors {{is the ability}} to push-steer a trailer around a corner. A girder trailer, for example, is double-articulated so the front tractor can pull the load around a corner while the rear <b>tractor</b> <b>pushes</b> it through, thereby making the load more manoeuvrable than a simple towing configuration. Use of a following tractor also can increase control and brake force descending an incline.|$|R
50|$|One Voisin Type V was {{transformed}} into a twin-engine aircraft in 1916 by adding a second Salmson {{in the front of the}} fuselage driving a tractor propeller. It is believed that the intention was to test a possible twin <b>pusher</b> and <b>tractor</b> propellor configuration for a new bomber planned by Voisin. The twin-engine Voisin Type 5 first flew in early 1916 but appears not to have been developed further. The first Voisin Type V came into operational use in 1915 and not long after replaced the Voisin Type III on the production lines. However, the Voisins 150 hp (as they were referred to at the Western Front) were held in low regard by their crews. Despite the more powerful engine, the Voisin Type Vs' payload was only marginally better and the maximum speed was only 13 km/h faster.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} power loading {{on the far}} field noise spectra and {{directivity}} of counter-rotating propellers (CRP) were studied using a model scale SR- 2 propeller in a low-speed anechoic wind tunnel. Approximately 264 far field noise measurements were obtained for each CRP configuration (<b>pusher</b> and <b>tractor)</b> and operating conditions covering from 30 to 140 deg to the flight direction and up to 340 deg circumferentially. Data indicated that the CRP tractor produced higher levels {{in the second and}} third harmonics which propagated axially; in effect, the noise exposure time increased over that of a single single-rotation propeller. The effects of pylon-to-propeller spacing, type of pylon attachment and reduced rear-blade row radius are considered and it is found that the 0. 3 chord radial pylon produces less additional noise than the 0. 1 chord radial pylon and that the 0. 2 chord tangential pylon is the quietest pusher configuration...|$|R

Due to the large scale of the test model (1 : 7. 5 of the actual dimension), to its elasticity and to the fully powered propulsive system, it was considered mandatory to address aeroelastic instability analyses in order to assure tests safety. Rational approaches were implemented in order to simulate the effects induced by variations of design stiffness and damping values, especially for the engines/pylons connection; reliable aeroelastic models and advanced computational strategies were properly implemented to enable fast flutter analyses covering several configuration cases in terms of power plant installation and tail empennages layout. Flutter and divergence clearance was finally demonstrated up to four times the maximum flow speed expected during wind tunnel test campaign...|$|R
50|$|Increases in bore {{and stroke}} gave the D.4 {{more than twice the}} swept volume of the C.4 and roughly doubled its power. The cast-steel cylinders, {{individually}} machined inside and out, were mounted separately onto a flat-sided aluminium crankcase. They were fastened down by long bolts between them, which reached into the crankcase to support the four inner crankshaft bearings. The main bearings were in the crankcase ends, and the ball race was designed to allow either <b>pusher</b> or <b>tractor</b> operation. A flywheel was fitted to the output shaft. Thin cylindrical copper water jackets surrounded the cylinders almost to their base, where a rubber ring, located by a circumferential groove in the cylinder, provided a sliding water seal that allowed for the differential thermal contraction of copper and steel. Cooling water was fed to these jackets by an engine-driven pump via a horizontal tube on the low right side of the engine, assuming a tractor orientation, and fed to the radiator by another tube on the top left.|$|R
40|$|Farmers try {{to reduce}} steps of soil {{preparation}} by using subsoiler and then following by equipment for soil pulverization such as a rotary tiller and a power harrow which take advantage of using a power take-off of a tractor.

The results showed that both the rotary tiller and the power harrow had negative slip, indicating that they generated force to <b>push</b> a <b>tractor.</b> The rotary tiller created negative vertical force to lift up the tractor whereas opposite result was found when using the power harrow. Since working depths were different, vertical forces, torques and PTO powers for two equipment types were significantly different.

40|$|Noise from {{contra-rotating}} open rotors is a {{major obstacle}} {{to the adoption of}} this fuel efficient technology as a viable aircraft propulsion system. A better understanding of both contra-rotating open rotor noise generation and reduction has been achieved due to ongoing extensive research. One of the most recent research activities is the WENEMOR (wind tunnel tests for the evaluation of the installation effects of Noise EMissions of an open rotor advanced regional aircraft) project, which has been developed in response to the requirements described in the Clean Sky-Integrated Technology Demonstrators under the heading of Green Regional Aircraft. The project investigates the airframe installation effects of a 1 / 7 th scale model of a regional aircraft equipped with two contra-rotating open rotors of the same rotor diameter, the same rotational speed and equal blade number. For this case, the blade passing frequency of rotor-alone tones and the frequency of relevant interaction tones cannot be distinguished due to the equal blade count of the two rotors. This study presents the tone directivity plots up to 4 √ó blade passing frequency of the isolated WENEMOR single pylon contra-rotating open rotor engine in both <b>pusher</b> and <b>tractor</b> configurations at various angles of incidence and flow velocities. A linear array of 13 microphones is deployed for the far field sound measurements. The tone directivity trends show the efficient on-axis acoustic radiation at all blade passing frequency tones with the contra-rotating open rotor tone at 2 √ó blade passing frequency dominating {{in the vast majority of}} the tests. The main objective is to compare the acoustic emission of <b>pusher</b> and <b>tractor</b> configurations tested under the same flow velocities and angles of incidence. The results suggest that the pusher configuration of the isolated contra-rotating open rotor tends to be slightly louder than the tractor at 2 √ó blade passing frequency. However, it is shown that the acoustic performance of the isolated contra-rotating open rotor is complicated and sensitive to any change in the flow velocity and the angle of incidence. The increasing flow velocity and the increasing angle of incidence show limited consistency in proportional trends in the directivity plots of sound pressure levels. It is anticipated that the findings will be different for a more realistic case of installed-on-model contra-rotating open rotor. ¬© The Author(s) 201...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{kinematic}} {{model of}} a <b>tractor</b> <b>pushing</b> an airplane without rod on the flat ground was established.

In this paper, we investigate the effects of different kinematic parameters on the manoeuvring stability of the system in backward-motion. The handling and stability of the reversing operation has been simulated with a steering wheel angle step input. A tractor driver‚Äôs operation of correcting steering angle has been proposed according to the experiment results. Theoretical verification and experimental results indicates that it is referential to study the handling and stability of the non-rod tractor-aircraft system in backward-motion...|$|R
50|$|The {{harvester}} is a slow-moving machine <b>pushed</b> by a <b>tractor,</b> which {{lifts the}} material {{off the ground}} and separates the nuts from the leaves, empty husks, and twigs. As the harvester drives over the rows, a rotating cylinder with hundreds of tines, rakes the material onto a belt. The belt takes the material over a blower and under a powerful vacuum that sucks any lightweight soil and leaves from the nuts, and discharges them into the orchard. The remaining nuts are conveyed into a nut cart that is pulled behind the harvester. Once a tote is filled with nuts, the forklift hauls away the full totes and bring empty ones back to the harvester to maximize the harvester's time.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanics}} of a tractor-trailer system {{moving up and}} down sloping ground under different operating conditions was theoretically simulated. A computer program was developed to analyze the system to predict the effect of both the trailer loading weight and the slope angle on the tractor stability, traction ability, and drawbar loading. The program was used to analyze a tractor-trailer system moving at uniform motion up and downhill. The results of this analysis showed that the tractor becomes unstable when towing a 3750 kg trailer uphill at 28 ¬∞ slope angle. Insufficient traction occurred at slope angles ranging from 15 ¬∞ to 18 ¬∞ corresponding to trailer weight of 3750 to 750 kg. The parallel component of drawbar pull reached a maximum value of 17318 N when the trailer was <b>pushing</b> the <b>tractor</b> downhill at 30 ¬∞ slope angle. The normal component (normal to the tractive surface) showed similar maximum values for both uphill and downhill motions of the system. The use of computer analysis in this study provided a significant improvement in predicting the effect of different parameters on stability and control of tractor-trailer combination on sloping ground...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the key objectives from an European Union funded collaborative project investigating the noise installation effects for novel regional advanced aircraft concepts using Open Rotor (OR) propulsion systems. The consortium for the project:WENEMOR, {{will address the}} topic by carrying out aero-acoustic measurements in the open test section of a large low speed wind tunnel using a complete reduced scale modular model of different configurations of an aircraft with installed counter rotating open rotor systems operating in both <b>pusher</b> and <b>tractor</b> modes. The principal goal of the project is to assess experimentally the noise shielding effectiveness of classic airframe components for different Open Rotor aircraft configurations. A complete 1 / 7 th scale aircraft has been designed and built for installation in the Pininfarina Aerodynamic and Aeroacoustic Research Center Wind Tunnel.

40|$|This work {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} the effect of an installed propeller slipstream on a wing boundary layer. The main objective was to analyse through wind tunnel experiments the effect of the propeller slipstream on the wing boundary layer characteristics such as: laminar flow extension and transition, laminar separation bubbles and reattachment and turbulent separation. Two propeller/wing configurations were studied: <b>pusher</b> and <b>tractor.</b> Experimental work was performed using two different models: a two-dimensional wing with a central cylindrical nacelle for the tractor configuration, and a simple two-dimensional wing with a downstream propeller for the pusher tests. The relative position between propeller and wing could be changed in the pusher model, and a total of 7 ¬†positions were analysed. For the tractor tests the relative propeller/wing was fixed, but three different propellers: two, three and four bladed were tested. Measurements included pressure distribution, hot wire anemometry and boundary layer characteristics by flow visualisation. The results showed that the pusher propeller inflow affects the wing characteristics by changing the lift, drag, and also delays the boundary layer transition and separation. These effects are highly dependent on the relative position of the wing/propeller. On the other hand, the tractor propeller slipstream induces transition and its effect is dependent on the number of blades...|$|R
