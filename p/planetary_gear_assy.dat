For example, <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> trains can be designed for following functions: gear reducers for power machinery, internal gear hubs for bicycle, gear increasers for wind generator, gear reducers for robot. In general, the reduction of non-coupled <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> train is less than 10.

40|$|A <b>Planetary</b> <b>gear</b> can {{transmit}} high torque ratio stably and, therefore, the gear {{is widely used}} in industrial applications, i. e., wind turbines, automobiles, helicopters. Unexpected failure of the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> results in substantial economic loss and human casualties.

This is mainly because understanding of complex dynamic behaviors of a <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> is lacking, such as multiple gear contacts, non-stationary axis of rotation, etc. This study thus proposes model-based fault diagnostics for a <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> that is based upon its dynamic analysis. Instead of vibration signals, this study uses transmission error (TE) signals for fault diagnostics of the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> because TE signals (a) are directly related to the dynamic behaviors of gear mesh stiffness and (b) increase as damages on a gear mesh reduce the gear mesh stiffness. A lumped parameter model was used for modeling dynamic behaviors of the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear.</b> For more precise modeling, mesh phase difference–between sun, ring, and planet gear – and contact ratio were taken into account in the lumped parameter model.
