5000|$|The term stand, {{as it is}} used to {{describe}} furniture such as a <b>plant</b> <b>stand</b> or music stand, generally implies a relatively small surface area supported at the required height, most usually by a turned leg or support known as a standard. Any inclined surface {{that can be used for}} supporting music may be thought of a music stand, although generally this function is divided between two types of furniture: a music stand proper and a music desk. The music stand, as the name suggests, consists of a support for the music raised upon a freestanding column or tripod, which, in addition to being movable may also be adjustable with regard to its height and the angle at which it may be tilted. A music desk generally implies a similar, tiltable support for the music, but rather than being raised on a stand, instead forms part of a table. In as much as the term [...] "desk" [...] originally implied a sloping-topped table for reading or writing, the slight adjustment necessary to turn a desk into a music desk was a relatively simple matter.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) {{variation in}} 78 oak stands {{of an important}} forest complex (the Veluwe) in The Netherlands. Based on historical maps and information oak stands were classified as planted or autochthonous. A genetic study by means of cpDNA haplotype characterisation was carried out to describe (i) genetic diversity within and among stands; (ii) to investigate whether the stands originated from the same haplotypes; (iii) to relate haplotype distribution {{to the status of}} the <b>stands.</b> The <b>planted</b> <b>stands</b> were all polytypic, comprising a mixture of the four haplotypes that are common for The Netherlands. In addition, a fifth, non-autochtonous haplotype was detected in these stands. Of the putative autochthonous oak stands ca. 50 % were monotypic and in all stands only the four autochthonous haplotypes were detected. These stands also showed lower intra-population diversity (h(S) = 0. 259) than the <b>planted</b> <b>stands</b> (h(S) = 0. 610). Moreover, a significant positive correlation between genetic differentiation and geographic distance was observed among the autochthonous stands, while this spatial genetic structure was absent among the <b>planted</b> <b>stands.</b> This study indicates substantial human influence on the distribution of genetic diversity in oak stands across the Veluwe. The occurrence of a non-autochthonous haplotype in 25 % of the <b>planted</b> <b>stands</b> suggests long-distance seed transfer. In the remaining 75 % of the <b>planted</b> <b>stands</b> long-distance seed transfer cannot be proven. However, the high genetic diversity and lack of spatial genetic structure in the <b>planted</b> <b>stands</b> suggests the use of mixtures of (local) seed material of various origins.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Since corn <b>plant</b> <b>stand</b> {{density is}} {{important}} for optimizing crop yield, several researchers have recently developed ground‐based systems for automatic measurement of this crop growth parameter. Our objective was to use data from such a system to assess the potential for estimation of corn <b>plant</b> <b>stand</b> density using remote sensing images. Aerial hyperspectral remote sensing imagery was collected on three dates over three plots of corn in central Iowa during the 2004 growing season. The imagery had a spatial resolution of 1 m and a spectral resolution of 3 nm between 498 nm and 855 nm. A machine vision system for early‐season measurement of corn <b>plant</b> <b>stand</b> density was also used to map every row of corn within the three plots, and a complete inventory of corn plants was generated as a rich ground reference dataset. A principal component regression {{analysis was used to}} assess relationships between <b>plant</b> <b>stand</b> density measurements and principal components of hyperspectral reflectance for each plot, on each image collection date, and at three different spatial resolutions (2, 6, and 10 m).

40|$|Introduction <b>Plant</b> <b>stand</b> {{sampling}} is {{an important}} method for monitoring plant growth and production. To do the sampling, the user typically goes to a field, manually records the data, and then comes back and types this data into the computer. This procedure is timeconsuming and {{requires a lot of}} effort by the user. Also, the user needs to enter the data twice, once on the data sheet and again on the computer. This increases the potential error rate. The purpose of this project is to design a software system (SampleTalk) to facilitate the sampling process. <b>Plant</b> <b>stand</b> sampling is a typical hand/eye busy application. Speech interfaces allow users to interact with a computer by voice. In the <b>plant</b> <b>stand</b> sampling case, the goal is to allow the user to enter data directly into the computer using voice while doing the sampling in the field. 1. 1 Speech Enabled Applications Speech is the most natural and widely-distributed human communication method.

The imagery had a spatial resolution of 1 m and a spectral resolution of 3 nm between 471 nm and 828 nm. A machine vision corn plant population sensing system {{was also used}} to map every row of corn within the three plots, and a complete inventory of corn plants was generated as a rich ground reference dataset for remote sensing image analysis. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to estimate corn <b>plant</b> <b>stand</b> density using reflectance in combinations of three wavebands, and R 2 s of up to 0. 82 were found. Estimates of corn <b>plant</b> <b>stand</b> density were best when using imagery collected at the later vegetative growth stage. Quantization effects due to row width complicated corn <b>plant</b> <b>stand</b> density estimates at 2 m spatial resolution, and better estimations were typically seen at resolutions of 6 m and 10 m. For the best-case scenarios, the first predictor variable in the regression model typically fell in the blue reflectance region (473 to 492 nm). The second predictor variable was typically in the longer green and shorter red wavelengths (584 to 635 nm), and reflectance for the third predictor variable was typically at the red edge (729 nm) or in the near-infrared region. Because results for {{the second and third}} predictor variables tended to straddle between important regions of typical vegetative reflectance spectra, it is expected that multiple linear regressions using a greater number of bands would improve the distinction between important spectral ranges for estimating corn <b>plant</b> <b>stand</b> density...|$|E

40|$|The southernmost European {{natural and}} planted pine forests {{are among the}} most {{vulnerable}} areas to warming-induced drought decline. Both drought stress and management factors (e. g., stand origin or reduced thinning) may induce decline by reducing the water available to trees but their relative importances have not been properly assessed. The role of stand origin - densely planted vs. naturally regenerated stands - as a decline driver can be assessed by comparing the growth and vigor responses to drought of similar natural vs. <b>planted</b> <b>stands.</b> Here, we compare these responses in natural and planted Black pine (Pinus nigra) stands located in southern Spain. We analyze how environmental factors - climatic (temperature and precipitation anomalies) and site conditions - and biotic factors - stand structure (age, tree size, density) and defoliation by the pine processionary moth - drive radial growth and crown condition at stand and tree levels. We also assess the climatic trends in the study area over the last 60 years. We use dendrochronology, linear mixed-effects models of basal area increment and structural equation models to determine how natural and <b>planted</b> <b>stands</b> respond to drought and current competition intensity. We observed that a temperature rise and a decrease in precipitation during the growing period led to increasing drought stress during the late 20 th century. Trees from <b>planted</b> <b>stands</b> experienced stronger growth reductions and displayed more severe crown defoliation after severe droughts than those from natural stands. High stand density negatively drove growth and enhanced crown dieback, particularly in <b>planted</b> <b>stands.</b> Also pine processionary moth defoliation was more severe in the growth of natural than in <b>planted</b> <b>stands</b> but affected tree crown condition similarly in both stand types. In response to drought, sharp growth reduction and widespread defoliation of <b>planted</b> Mediterranean pine <b>stands</b> indicate that they are more vulnerable and less resilient to drought stress than natural stands. To mitigate forest decline of <b>planted</b> <b>stands</b> in xeric areas such as the Mediterranean Basin, less dense and more diverse stands should be created through selective thinning or by selecting species or provenances that are more drought tolerant.

To study their potential in Northern growing conditions PGRs and their application time impacts on <b>plant</b> <b>stand</b> structure and yield formation in tall and short statured cultivars of barley, oat, and wheat were studied in the field. Crop stands were sprayed with the gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitors CCC [chlormequat chloride CCC], Moddus [Trinexapac-ethyl TE], or with ethylene-releasing Cerone [ethephon ETH] at the recommended times or at an earlier growth stage. CCC applied at Zadoks growth scale (ZGS) 13 - 14 increased and ETH applied at ZGS 39 - 40 reduced grain yield of oat by 370 kg ha- 1 and 270 kg ha- 1, respectively. In wheat, CCC applied at ZGS 31 - 32 reduced grain yield by 480 kg ha- 1. This yield reduction was associated with lower grain yield production by the main head and particularly lower single grain weight. In barley cv.
