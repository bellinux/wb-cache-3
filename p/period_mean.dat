40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the relative efficiency of rotating-panel designs in analysis-of-variance models. Throughout {{we assume that the}} parameter of interest is a linear combination of <b>period</b> <b>means</b> in the analysis-of-variance model. Results from spectral theory are used to obtain manageable expressions for the variance of the BLUE of this parameter. Relative efficiencies of the BLUE for rotating panels with different rotation periods are presented, e. g., for the <b>period</b> <b>means</b> themselves, of differences, or of averages of means. Moreover we present bounds on the relative efficiency which are valid irrespective of the parameter of interest. The analysis shows that the gains from choosing an optimal rotation design can be quite substantial, even if the cost of a reinterview equals the cost of a first observation. In many cases either the smallest or the highest possible rotation period is optimal. The analysis is illustrated with an empirical example concerning monthly consumer expenditures on food and clothing. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTwenty-four growing male buffalo calves (one year of age; 88. 54 ± 3. 81 kg average body weight) {{were divided}} into three {{comparable}} groups (I, II and III) {{on the basis of}} their body weight (BW) in a completely randomised design to study the effect of long term feeding of ammoniated wheat straw (AWS) and hydrochloric acid treated ammoniated wheat straw (HCl-AWS) on blood biochemical changes. The animals were offered a concentrate mixture (CM) along with wheat straw (WS), ammoniated wheat straw (AWS) (4 % urea at a 50 % moisture level) and hydrochloric acid treated ammoniated wheat straw (HCl-AWS) (4 % urea at a 50 % moisture level and HCl added to trap 30 % of NH 3 evolved) in groups I, II and III, respectively for an average daily gain (ADG) of 500 g. All the diets were made iso-nitrogenous by preparing three types of concentrate mixtures of different CP levels. The blood was collected from the jugular vein randomly from three animals of each group initially after 8 months post feeding and subsequently after two months interval up to 14 months of experimental feeding. Due to urea ammoniation, the CP content of WS increased from 3. 66 to 8. 51 and was further increased to 11. 35 due to the addition of HCl during urea-ammoniation of wheat straw. The cumulative <b>period</b> <b>mean</b> plasma glucose values (mg %), in group II (53. 13) were significantly (P < 0. 001) higher than those in groups I (48. 44) and III (50. 60). The cumulative <b>period</b> <b>mean</b> values of serum albumin and globulin (g %) were not significantly different and were comparable among the groups I (3. 33 and 3. 06), II (3. 53 and 2. 97) and III (3. 49 and 2. 94). The cumulative <b>period</b> <b>mean</b> values of serum albumin: globulin ratio and total protein values were not significantly different among the different groups. Serum urea and creatinine values were significantly (P < 0. 001) higher in group III (58. 66 and 2. 24) as compared to groups I and II. The cumulative <b>period</b> <b>mean</b> values of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (KA units) did not differ significantly, but serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) values (units*mL- 1) were significantly (P < 0. 001) higher in groups II and III than in group I. The cumulative <b>period</b> <b>mean</b> values of T 3 (ng*mL- 1) did not differ significantly among the groups, but T 4 values were significantly (P < 0. 001) higher in group III (22. 74) than in groups I (21. 41) and II (20. 89), respectively. Since the mean values of all the blood parameters were within the normal range, it may be concluded that feeding of ammoniated wheat straw treated with and without HCl to growing male buffalo calves for fourteen months has no adverse effect on the blood biochemical parameters...|$|E
