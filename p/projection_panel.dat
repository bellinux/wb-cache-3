The <b>projection</b> <b>panel</b> {{sits on the bed}} of the overhead projector, and acts like a piece of transparency. The panels have a VGA input, and sometimes Composite (RCA) and S-Video input. Later models have remotes, with functions such as 'freeze' which lets you freeze the image, useful for when you want to leave something on the screen whilst you do other things. Earlier models only had 640x480 resolution, while newer ones had up to SVGA resolution. Proxima, one maker of the panels, included a magic wand and sensor, which worked with the sensor detecting where you put the wand, to create and interactive effect, the equivalent of today's smart boards.|$|E

Study focusFuture climate change models were used to drive a hydrologic model of the UCRB to evaluate future water resources and hydropower potential of the basin, using three different climate <b>projections.</b> The Intergovernmental <b>Panel</b> on Climate Change (IPCC) emission scenarios, the A 2 -business as usual, and the B 1 -reduced emissions scenarios were evaluated. More than 4500 water diversions and 17 reservoirs were incorporated into the hydrologic model. New hydrological insights for the regionPrecipitation projections from climate models vary up to 16 %; flow projections revealed greater differences, up to 50 %. The climate models projected increase in temperature at low elevations with extreme seasonality at high elevations, although summer temperatures increased at all elevations. The models projected a 60 % decline in precipitation at lower elevations and a 74 % increase at high elevations, although precipitation declined during the summer months at all elevations. Using the A 2 scenario an overall decrease in annual flow was predicted, attributed to a reduction in precipitation and increasing temperature trends; however, this was not consistent during the winter months, which showed an increase in precipitation at high elevations and a modest temperature increase during the winter and resulted in an increase in stream flow. The responses to climate change on reservoir levels varied basin-wide due to variability in precipitation, evapotranspiration, and stream flow. Simulations indicated that water levels in Blue Mesa Reservoir (the largest reservoir in the UCRB) would decline by more than 70 % with increasing annual temperatures. Reservoirs with smaller surface areas to the volume ratio were not significantly impacted by evapotranspiration. Our results indicate that hydropower management strategies in the UCRB must adapt to potential climate change, but the required adaptations are dependent on several factors including reservoir size and location...|$|R
40|$|Propulsion, while {{conventionally}} {{included on}} the list of important aeronautical disciplines along with aerodynamics, structures, etc., is in itself a systems endeavor, analogous to the engineering of the entire vehicle; indeed propulsion encompasses important aspects of all the other disciplines. In recognition of this fact, the panel focused its discussion on those aspects of the key disciplines that are especially or uniquely important to propulsion. From the initial development of the airplane, the propulsion system has been {{recognized as one of the}} pacing technologies. It is perhaps because of the technological disparity between the reciprocating engine and the primitive airframe that the two remained relatively and separate, were developed somewhat independently, usually by different organizations. In recent years, the maturing of the gas turbine power plant and the advance in high-speed airframes have rendered this separation somewhat artificial. The power plant and the airframe now share common structural and aerodynamic elements; as the flight Mach number rises, the degree of interaction increases. By the year 2000, this interdependence will have increased in many respects to a point where independent design may not be practical or possible. During the period since the initiation of the aircraft gas turbine, the solid propellant rocket and the liquid propellant rocket, a vast array of other novel engines have been studied, covering the full spectrum of flight conditions from low subsonic to hypersonic and transatmospheric flight. In each instance, performance limits have been investigated under the assumption that current technology or reasonably foreseeable technology would be available for their development. Among the extensive list of advanced, high-performance concepts and cycles examined are the hypersonic ramjet, the variable cycle, runway-to-orbit airbreathing engine, the ram rocket (airbreathing and rich solid propellant rocket), and the air turborocket. At various times, these systems have come relatively close to meriting development and application. In many instances, limitations of materials and technologies curtailed development. As important and with almost equal frequency, the lack of commercial or military utility of the concept precluded the necessary funding. It is instructive to note that two former items on this list, the turbofan (bypass engine) and the high-speed turboprop, are respectively a mainstay engine and a promising development. In the case of the turbofan, its full potential could not be realized until turbine cooling technology had been developed and new materials developed to permit the construction of transonic fans. In the case of the highspeed turbopropeller engine, not only were the material and turbine technologies needed, but, in addition, the rise in fuel costs provided the impetus to take advantage of its favorable fuel consumption characteristic. As the basic technologies progress and as new missions become attractive, the engines in the foregoing list become candidates for new feasibility studies and further technology development. At the present time, the ram rocket is the prime contender to augment the range of small missiles. Of interest also is the hypersonic ram jet and its logical extension, the runway-to-orbit airbreathing engine. Much of this report deals with the development of current or near-future power plant concepts. First, the motivating factors for aeronautical propulsion research are reviewed as a reminder of the importance of continued effort in a field that has often been characterized as mature. Next, technical areas are discussed in which the panel feels additional research effort is warranted and would lead to the realization of the technological potentials between now and the year 2000. Under these guidelines, new cycles (e. g., isothermal energy exchange) were not considered by the panel. Finally, although facility requirements were not a prime consideration in the current <b>projections,</b> the <b>panel</b> believes that the increasing complexity of propulsion systems; the need for more refined interaction between propulsion system, airframe, and controls; and increasing operation in adverse weather will require test capabilities beyond those now available (see appendix).

40|$|Forests play three central {{roles in}} the carbon cycle. Forests act as sinks and sources of carbon. Second, {{harvested}} wood products (HWP) from forests store carbon over their life cycle. Third, wood products conserve fossil fuels through energy substitution and by their lower fossil-fuel usage during their manufacture. International governmental bodies have recognized these {{roles in the}}ir discussions. The current United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) methodology used to prepare national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories provides the suggested default assumption that all forest biomass harvested be recorded as an immediate source. Additionally, the convention also recognizes that the wood product sink can be included {{if it can be}} documented that existing stocks are increasing. Our study focuses on the second role [...] HWP and their function in forest carbon accounting. Past studies estimated carbon additions and emissions under alternate accounting approaches and analyzed their impacts using case studies. We calculated the emissions associated with three alternative approaches for 30 regions comprising the global forest sector and reported results for the globe and regions. We briefly investigated alternative methods to calculate the additions and emissions under alternate approaches by examining the sensitivity of alternative assumptions on landfill pools. We also investigated economic implications associated with the alternative approaches by imposing costs on the global forest products industry for national emissions of the forest carbon account. Three approaches to calculate stock changes and estimated emissions associated with HWP proposed by IPCC are the stock change approach, the production approach and the atmospheric flow approach. The stock change approach estimates the net annual change in carbon stocks in the forest and wood products pool within national boundaries. Briefly stated, stock changes in the forest pool are accounted for in the producing country. Stock changes in HWP pool are accounted for in the consuming country. The production approach also estimates net annual changes in the forest and HWP carbon stocks. Producing nations account for forest stock changes and the changes in carbon from HWP that came from domestic harvests including exported wood products. The atmospheric flow approach estimates carbon flows between the atmosphere and the forest and HWP pools within the national boundary. Producing nations account for forest growth carbon and consuming countries count emissions from wood and wood products. We examined the overall effect of the approaches on national emissions to compare the results to those obtained using the IPCC default. For sake of clarity, we divided the national account into the forest account and the HWP account. All that we were interested in the forest account was that portion of emissions calculated by measuring stock changes affected by the HWP accounting approaches. Within each accounting approach there may be more than one estimation method that can be applied with different levels of complexity, depending on data availability. Two examples are alternative assumptions on the fraction of wood product leaving the in-use pool every year and degrading half lives. We examined the sensitivity of IPCC good practice guidelines default assumptions changing the default parameters associated with half-lives of discarded products. Other sensitivities are possible given the data base created but not pursued for this study. We used an economic model of global forest sector to extend the calculations of carbon emissions under the different approaches to 2016. Economic equilibria to production, consumption, traded volumes and prices were calculated for coniferous and non-coniferous sawn wood and plywood. We maintained industrial roundwood material balances in the production of these products using estimated input/output coefficients such that equilibrium amounts produced, consumed and traded for saw logs were also calculated for the years 2004 to 2016. <b>Projections</b> of other <b>panels</b> and paper and paperboard products and their use of industrial roundwood were required as input by the economic model so as to maintain material balances at the roundwood level. Paper and paperboard projections were made using estimated income elasticities and gross domestic product (GDP) projections differentiated regionally. Scenario assessment was employed to examine the trade and competitiveness implications associated with alternative approaches. We imposed a cost in the country {{in the form of an}} emission tax. The tax level was determined by using the calculated forest sector removals/emissions for the default and three alternative approaches. The impact of the emission tax for each approach was then compared with the IPCC default approach. We chose to limit the analysis of economic impacts to the softwood lumber sector since other wood product sectors accounted for in the model do not use equilibrium methods to determine stock inflows in response to a cost increase. We investigated a carbon price of $ 10 and $ 35 per tonne of CO 2. We summarize our conclusions as follows. • Using available forestry data and IPCC accounting methods that consider carbon in HWP, it is demonstrated that HWP pools are increasing globally. By 2002, global carbon stocks in products in use had accumulated to approximately 4, 508 Tg C, and were increasing at a rate of 1. 2 % per year. Global carbon stocks in landfills were estimated to be 3, 447 Tg C and were increasing at 2. 4 % per year. • Different accounting approaches (i. e. the current IPCC default, stock change, production, and atmospheric flow) led to different national accounts of emissions. Compared to alternative approaches, the IPCC default approach resulted in higher national emissions for all nations, with the possible exception of a few regions where much of the harvest is used for fuel wood. The stock change approach produced lower emissions for large net importers of HWP. The production and atmospheric flow approaches led to lower emissions for large net exporters of HWP. • If the forest products industry became financially responsible for HWP carbon emissions, the selection of an accounting approach could significantly affect the industry. In particular, the current IPCC default approach could result in lower global industry output and higher lumber prices than the three alternatives (i. e. stock change, production, and atmospheric flow). The differences between the three alternative approaches, do not appear to be significant at the global level (differences in wood costs of $ 0. 25 per m 3 or less). In some countries, however, the differences between the three alternatives can be more than $ 10 per m 3 of wood. • The stock change approach can give rise to the elimination of accounted HWP emissions when import levels lead to increasing HWP pools that are greater than domestic harvest emissions. • Calculating the land-filled pool using alternative values of half-lives led to relatively small changes in emission accounts. These changes were relatively constant across accounting approaches. • The economic impact of emission changes depended on the level of these charges • High carbon prices led to persistent change in coniferous sawlog harvest levels and higher prices in softwood lumber markets. We expect similar responses in other forest product markets including pulp and paper. Their raw material costs would increase since the emission tax increases harvesting costs, and lower output by the softwood lumber sector reduces residual supply to pulp mills. • Low carbon prices led to higher price in these markets as consumption levels recovered. • Higher prices under both low and high carbon values could signal product substitution...|$|R
