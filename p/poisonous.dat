5|$|Although not <b>poisonous,</b> M.galopus and the {{varieties}} candida and nigra are inedible.|$|E
5|$|Lepidella {{section of}} Amanita also {{contains}} several <b>poisonous</b> species.|$|E
5|$|Litvinenko had {{ingested}} polonium-210, a <b>poisonous</b> radioactive isotope.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} Lepidoptera {{sequester}} or manufacture toxins which {{are stored in}} their body tissue, rendering them <b>poisonous</b> to predators; examples include the monarch butterfly in the Americas and Atrophaneura species in Asia. Predators that eat <b>poisonous</b> lepidopterans may become sick and vomit violently, and so learn to avoid those species. A predator who has previously eaten a <b>poisonous</b> lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Toxic butterflies and larvae tend to develop bright colours and striking patterns as an indicator to predators about their toxicity. This phenomenon is known as aposematism.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} plants are <b>poisonous</b> to guinea pigs, {{including}} bracken, bryony, buttercup, charlock, deadly nightshade, foxglove, hellebore, hemlock, lily of the valley, mayweed, monkshood, privet, ragwort, rhubarb, speedwell, toadflax (both Linaria vulgaris and Linaria dalmatica), and wild celery. Additionally, any plant which grows from a bulb (e.g., tulip or onion) is normally considered <b>poisonous,</b> as well as ivy and oak tree leaves.|$|E
5|$|Ants prey on P. fimbriata while P. fimbriata {{does not}} stalk ants, {{regarding}} them as <b>poisonous</b> or very unpleasant. P. fimbriata is also preyed upon by birds, frogs, and mantises.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Morchella elata group of black morels, M.importuna is sought after as a choice edible mushroom. Raw morels are <b>poisonous</b> and should always be cooked.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 19th century the {{practice}} fell into decline, {{when it was}} discovered that the principal active agent in tobacco smoke, nicotine, is <b>poisonous.</b>|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth I of England: The aging Queen of England. Already {{close to}} death, she is {{killed by a}} <b>poisonous</b> gas device {{constructed}} by Otto Von Doom.|$|E
5|$|Horses have an {{advanced}} sense of taste, which {{allows them to}} sort through fodder and choose what they would most like to eat, and their prehensile lips can easily sort even small grains. Horses generally will not eat <b>poisonous</b> plants, however, there are exceptions; horses will occasionally eat toxic amounts of <b>poisonous</b> plants even when there is adequate healthy food.|$|E
5|$|Mycologist Roger Phillips {{claims that}} L.blennius is edible when cooked, but not recommended, while others {{describe}} it as inedible or even <b>poisonous.</b> The milk tastes very hot and acrid.|$|E

5|$|The boranes (boron {{hydrogen}} compounds) {{and similar}} gaseous compounds are quite <b>poisonous.</b> As usual, {{it is not}} an element that is intrinsically <b>poisonous,</b> but their toxicity depends on structure. The boranes are also highly flammable and require special care when handling. Sodium borohydride presents a fire hazard owing to its reducing nature and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid. Boron halides are corrosive.|$|E
5|$|The {{metabolic}} {{system of}} a particular organism determines which substances it will find nutritious and which <b>poisonous.</b> For example, some prokaryotes use hydrogen sulfide as a nutrient, yet this gas is <b>poisonous</b> to animals. The speed of metabolism, the metabolic rate, influences how much food an organism will require, and also affects how {{it is able to}} obtain that food.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{considered}} <b>poisonous,</b> P.fusiformis {{is not recommended}} for consumption. Some related species such as Phallus impudicus or Mutinus caninus {{are considered to be}} edible (or even delicacies) in the immature egg stage; however, the foul smell of stinkhorns at maturity would likely deter most individuals from eating them.|$|E
5|$|Although the edibility of S.amygdalinus is {{not known}} with certainty, {{authorities}} often recommend to avoid consuming blue-staining, red-pored boletes, as several are <b>poisonous.</b> The species was implicated in one group of poisonings in California in 1996–97, {{but because of the}} nature of the symptoms experienced, there was probably more than one type of mushroom consumed.|$|E
5|$|As it is {{difficult}} to accurately identify a safe mushroom without proper training and knowledge, it is often advised to assume that a wild mushroom is <b>poisonous</b> and not to consume it.|$|E
5|$|Avata-nirodhana (confined in a hole): People who imprison {{others in}} dark wells, crannies or {{mountain}} caves are pushed into this hell, a dark well engulfed with <b>poisonous</b> fumes and smoke that suffocates them.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} another {{important}} defense found among species of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, usually being advertised by bright colors, such as the monarch butterfly. They obtain their toxicity by sequestering the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues. Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins. Predators that eat <b>poisonous</b> butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently, learning not to eat those types of species; this is actually the basis of Müllerian mimicry. A predator who has previously eaten a <b>poisonous</b> lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Some ground beetles of the Carabidae family can spray chemicals from their abdomen with great accuracy, to repel predators.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, <b>poisonous</b> or distasteful {{animals that}} {{advertise}} their presence with warning coloration (aposematism) use patterns that emphasize rather than disrupt their outlines. For example, skunks, salamanders and monarch butterflies all have high-contrast patterns that display their outlines.|$|E
5|$|Coprinopsis atramentaria, {{commonly}} known as the common ink cap or inky cap, is an edible (but sometimes <b>poisonous,</b> when combined with alcohol) mushroom found in Europe and North America. Previously known as Coprinus atramentarius, it is the second best known ink cap and previous member of the genus Coprinus after C.comatus. It is a widespread and common fungus found throughout the northern hemisphere. Clumps of mushrooms arise after rain from spring to autumn, commonly in urban and disturbed habitats such as vacant lots and lawns, as well as grassy areas. The grey-brown cap is initially bell-shaped before opening, after which it flattens and disintegrates. The flesh is thin and the taste mild. It can be eaten but is <b>poisonous</b> when consumed with alcohol – hence another common name, tippler's bane.|$|E
5|$|<b>Poisonous</b> species {{often use}} bright {{colouring}} to warn potential predators of their toxicity. These warning colours {{tend to be}} red or yellow combined with black, with the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) being an example. Once a predator has sampled one of these, {{it is likely to}} remember the colouration next time it encounters a similar animal. In some species, such as the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.), the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked, exhibiting their bright colours to the predator. The frog Allobates zaparo is not <b>poisonous,</b> but mimics the appearance of other toxic species in its locality, a strategy that may deceive predators.|$|E
5|$|South American giant {{cockroaches}} of {{the genus}} Lucihormetica {{were believed to be}} the first known example of defensive mimicry, emitting light in imitation of bioluminescent, <b>poisonous</b> click beetles. However, doubt has been cast on this assertion, and there is no conclusive evidence that the cockroaches are bioluminescent.|$|E
5|$|The more distantly related ascomycete {{mushrooms}} of {{the genus}} Verpa, such as V. bohemica and V. conica, are also known as false morels, early morels or thimble morels; like the Gyromitra, they are eaten by some and considered <b>poisonous</b> by others.|$|E
5|$|The most <b>poisonous</b> {{of these}} frogs, the golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis), has enough toxin on average to kill ten to twenty men or about ten {{thousand}} mice. Most other dendrobatids, while colorful and toxic enough to discourage predation, pose far less risk to humans or other large animals.|$|E
5|$|The <b>poisonous</b> fruit bodies cause {{neurotoxic}} symptoms if ingested, {{an effect}} {{attributable to the}} compound polyporic acid, which is present in high concentrations. When an alkaline solution {{is placed on the}} fungus, the flesh turns violet. The fungus is used in mushroom dyeing to produce purple colors.|$|E
5|$|Toxins of type I {{systems are}} small, {{hydrophobic}} proteins that confer toxicity by damaging cell membranes. Few intracellular targets of type I toxins have been identified, possibly {{due to the}} difficult nature of analysing proteins that are <b>poisonous</b> to their bacterial hosts.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many civilizations, {{records of}} Egyptian {{knowledge}} {{and use of}} poisons can only be dated back to approximately 300 BC. However, {{it is believed that}} the earliest known Egyptian pharaoh, Menes, studied the properties of <b>poisonous</b> plants and venoms, according to early records.|$|E
5|$|While {{members of}} the Liliaceae s.s. {{have been used as}} food sources in humans, the bulbs of some species are <b>poisonous</b> to {{household}} pets (bulb toxicosis) if eaten and may cause serious complications, such as renal failure in cats from Lilies, particularly Lilium longiflorum (Easter Lily). Dogs may develop less serious effects such as gastrointestinal problems and central nervous system depression. Most Fritillaria (e.g. Fritillaria imperialis, Fritillaria meleagris) bulbs contain <b>poisonous</b> neurotoxic alkaloids such as imperialin (peiminine), which may be deadly if ingested in quantity, while other species such as Fritillaria camschatcensis and Fritillaria affinis are edible. Tulips can cause skin irritation due to the presence of tuliposides and tulipalins, which are also found in the flowers, leaves and stems of Fritillaria. These are also toxic to a variety of animals.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of species of {{families}} Saturniidae, Limacodidae and Megalopygidae have stinging caterpillars which have <b>poisonous</b> setae, also called urticating hairs, {{and in the case}} of Lonomia – a Brazilian saturniid genus – can kill a human due to its potent anticoagulant poison. Caterpillars of many taxa that have sequestered toxic chemicals from host plants or have sharp urticating hair or spines, display aposematic colouration and markings.|$|E
5|$|All {{members of}} Cicuta except C.bulbifera contain {{high levels of}} the <b>poisonous</b> {{principle}} cicutoxin, an unsaturated aliphatic alcohol that is structurally {{closely related to the}} toxin oenanthotoxin found in the plant hemlock water dropwort. Cicutoxin is present at all stages of growth and {{in all parts of the}} plant, but is most concentrated in the roots which appear to be the most toxic in the early spring. Its primary toxic effect is to act as a stimulant in the central nervous system. It is a non-competitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist. Cicutoxin acts on the GABAA receptor causing a block of the chloride channel which results in neuronal depolarization. In the presence of cicutoxin this depolarization continues unabated causing cell overactivity. The hyperactivity in brain cells results in seizures. Cicutoxin is highly <b>poisonous</b> and water hemlock is considered one of North America's most toxic plants. Ingestion of Cicuta can be fatal in humans and there are reports in the medical literature of severe poisoning and death as early as 1670. A number of people have also died following ingestion of the plant in the 20th and 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Baorangia bicolor, {{also known}} as the two-colored bolete or red and yellow bolete after its {{two-tone}} coloring scheme of red and yellow, is an edible fungus in the genus Baorangia. It inhabits most of eastern North America, primarily east of the Rocky Mountains and in season during the summer and fall months but can be found across the globe in China and Nepal. Its fruit body, the mushroom, is classed as medium or large in size, which helps distinguish it from the many similar appearing species that have a smaller stature. A deep blue/indigo bruising of the pore surface and a less dramatic bruising coloration change in the stem {{over a period of several}} minutes are identifying characteristics that distinguish it from the similar <b>poisonous</b> species Boletus sensibilis. There are two variations of this species, variety borealis and variety subreticulatus, and several other similar species of fungi are not <b>poisonous.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bees are {{themselves}} Müllerian mimics of other aposematic insects {{with the same}} colour scheme, including wasps, lycid and other beetles, and many butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) which {{are themselves}} distasteful, often through acquiring bitter and <b>poisonous</b> chemicals from their plant food. All the Müllerian mimics, including bees, benefit from the reduced risk of predation that results from their easily recognised warning coloration.|$|E
5|$|Corn (USA), or maize (British English), is {{the second}} most {{palatable}} grain. It provides twice as much digestible energy as an equal volume of oats and is low in fiber. Because of these characteristics, it is easy to over-feed corn, causing obesity, so horses are seldom fed corn all by itself. Nutritionists caution horse owners that moldy corn is <b>poisonous</b> if fed to horses.|$|E
