5000|$|In telecommunications, a <b>pulse</b> <b>link</b> <b>repeater</b> (PLR) is {{a device}} that {{interfaces}} concatenated E and M signaling paths.|$|R
50|$|Many amateurs {{have found}} the 33 {{centimeter}} band to be ideal for <b>linking</b> <b>repeaters</b> together. Some of the biggest <b>linked</b> <b>repeater</b> systems in the United States use the 33 centimeter band as their link backbone.|$|R

50|$|The loss of Internet {{does not}} degrade the local {{operation}} of a D-STAR repeater system. Over the Internet linking and routing of traffic may be degraded. Some groups are using microwave based systems, such as HamWAN, to <b>link</b> <b>repeaters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Far West Repeater Association {{maintains}} 5 <b>linked</b> <b>repeaters</b> in Humboldt County, California. The repeaters have an autopatch function {{which allows}} users to make local telephone calls in the Humboldt Bay region. The autopatch also allows users a direct link to the 9-1-1 operator for emergency messages.|$|R
25|$|<b>Linked</b> <b>repeater</b> systems, however, {{can allow}} {{transmissions}} of VHF and higher frequencies across hundreds of miles. Repeaters are usually located on heights of land or tall structures and allow operators to communicate {{over hundreds of}} miles using hand-held or mobile transceivers. Repeaters can also be linked together by using other amateur radio bands, landline, or the Internet.|$|R
50|$|<b>Repeaters</b> may be <b>linked</b> {{together}} {{in order to}} form {{what is known as}} a <b>linked</b> <b>repeater</b> system or <b>linked</b> <b>repeater</b> network. In such a system, when one repeater is keyed-up by receiving a signal, all the other repeaters in the network are also activated and will transmit the same signal. The connections between the repeaters are made via radio (usually on a different frequency from the published transmitting frequency) for maximum reliability. Some networks have a feature to allow the user being able to turn additional <b>repeaters</b> and <b>links</b> on or off on the network. This feature is typically done with DTMF tones to control the network infrastructure. Such a system allows coverage over a wide area, enabling communication between amateurs often hundreds of miles (several hundred km) apart. These systems are used for area or regional communications, for example in Skywarn nets, where storm spotters relay severe weather reports. All the user has to know is which channel to use in which area.|$|R
50|$|For ham/amateur radio operators, two <b>linked</b> <b>repeaters</b> {{are near}} the top of the mountain.The {{frequencies}} are 146.74 MHz, with a 600 kHz negative offset (the 2 meter repeater), and 53.75 MHz, with a 1.7 MHz negative offset, and a PL Tone of 100 Hz (the 6 meter repeater). The repeaters are also part of Washington State's Evergreen Intertie, a statewide amateur radio repeater/emergency communications linking system.|$|R
5000|$|The system {{today is}} capable of <b>linking</b> <b>repeaters</b> {{together}} locally and through the Internet utilizing callsigns for routing of traffic. Servers are linked via TCP/IP utilizing proprietary [...] "gateway" [...] software, available from Icom. This allows amateur radio operators to talk to any other amateurs participating in a particular gateway [...] "trust" [...] environment. The current master gateway in the United States is operated by the K5TIT group in Texas, who {{were the first to}} install a D-STAR repeater system in the U.S.|$|R
50|$|The Intermountain Intertie is {{the biggest}} <b>linked</b> <b>repeater</b> system {{in the state of}} Utah. The Intermountain Intertie covers areas west of the Wasatch Front, from Saint George to Tremonton. The Intermountain Intertie also covers areas in the {{northwest}} of Utah up to Boise, Idaho and to the northeast to Rock Springs, Wyoming. The Intertie reaches into parts of Wyoming, Montana, and Arizona. There are no Intermountain Intertie repeaters headed east from I-15 on I-70; in this area, the Sinbad Desert Amateur Radio Club Intertie has substantial coverage.|$|R

5000|$|Radio signals have a {{limitations}} due {{to distance}} and terrain. If two radios are far apart, {{or there is}} a mountain in the way, {{they will not be}} able to communicate. To alleviate this, radio repeaters are installed on mountaintops to repeat the signal from one radio to another, or group of others. This is a standard repeater site. The signal is received by the repeater from the originating radio and re-broadcast so the receiving radio(s) can receive the radio signal. A repeater site gives approximately a 50-mile radius of coverage. Trunk ed radio is a method of using a bank of channels (frequencies) to repeat for multiple [...] "Talk Groups" [...] or fleet of radios. Many Talk Groups can share the channels, without hearing each other's conversation. A Passport system combines both of these technologies as a network of <b>linked</b> <b>repeaters</b> over a wide area that repeat the signal from several mountaintops simultaneously.|$|R

50|$|Auto-negotiation uses similar pulses labeled as NLP. NLP {{are still}} unipolar, positive-only, {{and of the}} nominal {{duration}} of 100 ns; but each LIT {{is replaced by a}} pulse burst consisting of 17 to 33 pulses sent 125 Âµs apart. Each such pulse burst is called a fast <b>link</b> <b>pulse</b> (FLP) burst. The time interval between the start of each FLP burst is the same 16 milliseconds as between normal <b>link</b> <b>pulses</b> (variation tolerance of 8 ms).|$|R
50|$|A <b>link</b> {{radio or}} <b>repeater</b> {{is needed to}} {{interface}} to the IRLP board. The radio's COS (carrier operated squelch) and PTT lines must {{be available to the}} IRLP board.

50|$|Under Cisco's pre-standard scheme, the PSE (switch) {{will send}} a Fast <b>Link</b> <b>Pulse</b> (FLP) on the {{transmit}} pair. The PD (device) connects the transmit line to the receive line via a low pass filter. And thus the PSE gets the FLP in return. And a common mode current between pair 1 and 2 will be provided resulting in 48 V DC and 6.3 W default of allocated power. The PD has then to provide Ethernet link within 5 seconds to the auto-negotiation mode switch port. A later CDP message with a type-length-value tells the PSE its final power requirement. A discontinued <b>link</b> <b>pulses</b> shuts down power.|$|R
5000|$|Auto-negotiation (formerly [...] "NWay") {{is based}} on pulses {{similar to those used}} by 10BASE-T devices to detect the {{presence}} of a connection to another device. These connection present pulses are sent by Ethernet devices when they are not sending or receiving any frames. They are unipolar positive-only electrical pulses of a nominal duration of 100 ns, with a maximum pulse width of 200 ns, generated at a 16 ms time interval (with a timing variation tolerance of 8 ms). These <b>pulses</b> are called <b>link</b> integrity test (LIT) pulses in the 10BASE-T terminology, and are referred to as normal <b>link</b> <b>pulses</b> (NLP) in the auto-negotiation specification.|$|R
25|$|Modern {{personal}} computers have encouraged {{the use of}} digital modes such as radioteletype (RTTY) which previously required cumbersome mechanical equipment. Hams led the development of packet radio in the 1970s, which has employed protocols such as AX.25 and TCP/IP. Specialized digital modes such as PSK31 allow real-time, low-power communications on the shortwave bands. EchoLink using Voice over IP technology has enabled amateurs to communicate through local Internet-connected repeaters and radio nodes, while IRLP has allowed the <b>linking</b> of <b>repeaters</b> to provide greater coverage area. Automatic link establishment (ALE) has enabled continuous amateur radio networks to operate on the high frequency bands with global coverage. Other modes, such as FSK441 using software such as WSJT, are used for weak signal modes including meteor scatter and moonbounce communications.|$|R

40|$|Proceedings of the 2003 Georgia Water Resources Conference, held April 23 - 24, 2003, at the University of Georgia. The {{objective}} of this on-going study {{is to develop a}} theoretical framework to explain the graded change of invertebrate assemblages in riverine floodplain wetlands from the headwaters to the lower river reaches. We predict that floodplains in {{the upper reaches of the}} watershed will have flood <b>pulses</b> <b>linked</b> to local storm events and will be short in duration, and thus invertebrate assemblages will be dominated largely by movements of opportunistic riverine or terrestrial organisms into the wetlands. Downstream communities will consist increasingly of obligate wetland invertebrates since inundation periods become longer and more predictable in the lower reaches of the watershed, allowing sufficient time for wetland communities to develop. To test this hypothesis, we are examining invertebrate populations at nine floodplain sites in the Oconee/Altamaha River Watershed along a continuum of streams and rivers from low to high discharge. Floodplain invertebrates are essential in modifying, storing and transporting organic matter in and between wetland and riverine systems. Unfortunately, the wetland habitats upon which these invertebrates depend are among Georgiaâs most threatened. The information developed from this study will contribute towards informing management decisions affecting invertebrates and other animals in floodplains of the Southeast...|$|R
