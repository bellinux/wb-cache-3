40|$|This work {{reports the}} design of a live-cell {{monitoring}} platform based on a macroporous scaffold of a conducting polymer, poly(3, 4 -ethylene dioxythiophene) :poly(styrenesulfonate). The conducting polymer scaffolds support 3 D cell cultures due to their biocompatibility and tissue-like elasticity, which can be manipulated by inclusion of biopolymers such as collagen. Integration of a media <b>perfusion</b> <b>tube</b> inside the scaffold enables homogenous cell spreading and fluid transport throughout the scaffold, ensuring long term cell viability. This also allows for co-culture of multiple cell types inside the scaffold. The inclusion of cells within the porous architecture affects the impedance of the electrically conducting polymer network and, thus, is utilized as an in situ tool to monitor cell growth. Therefore, while being {{an integral part of the}} 3 D tissue, the conducting polymer is an active component, enhancing the tissue function, and forming the basis for a bioelectronic device with integrated sensing capability...|$|E
40|$|We used a flow {{method for}} Ca 2 + {{activation}} of sheep cardiac and rabbit skeletal ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels in lipid bilayers, which activated RyRs in < 20 ms and maintained a steady [Ca 2 +] for 5 s. [Ca 2 +] was rapidly altered by flowing Ca(2 +) -buffered solutions containing 100 or 200 microM Ca 2 + from a <b>perfusion</b> <b>tube</b> {{inserted in the}} cis, myoplasmic chamber above the bilayer. During steps from 0. 1 to 100 microM, [Ca 2 +] reached 0. 3 microM (activation threshold) and 10 microM (maximum Po) in times consistent with predictions of a solution exchange model. Immediately following rapid RyR activation, Po was 0. 67 (cardiac) and 0. 45 (skeletal) at a holding voltage of + 40 mV (cis/trans). Po then declined (at constant [Ca 2 +]) in 70 % of channels (n = 25) with time constants ranging from. 5 to 15 s. The mechanism for Po decline, whether it be adaptation or inactivation, was not determined in this study. cis, 2 mM Mg 2 + reduced the initial Po for skeletal RyRs to 0. 21 and marginally slowed the declining phase. During very rapid falls in [Ca 2 +] from mM (inhibited) to sub-microM (sub-activating) levels, skeletal RyR did not open. We conclude the RyR gates responsible for Ca(2 +) -dependent activation and inhibition of skeletal RyRs can gate independently...|$|E

40|$|Whole-cell {{recording}} is {{the most}} widely used configuration of the patch recording technique, mainly because it allows to manipulate the intracellular environment while recording membrane current. However, the patch pipette tapered shank and the small tip opening give high access resistances and preclude efficient exchange between pipette solution and cell cytosol. Independently by the recording configuration, another problem of this technique is to gain consistently tight seals. Here it is described a method to enlarge the pipette shank without affecting the tip opening diameter, through the calibrated combination of heat and air pressure, with a custom made inexpensive set-up. These pressure polished pipettes give small access resistances, and allow the accommodation of pulled quartz or plastic <b>perfusion</b> <b>tubes</b> very close to the pipette tip (to deliver exogenous molecules into the cytosol with a controlled timing).

40|$|The phototransduction {{enzymatic cascade}} in cones is less {{understood}} than in rods, and the zebrafish {{is an ideal}} model with which to investigate vertebrate and human vision. Therefore, here, for the first time, the zebrafish green cone photoresponse is characterized also to obtain a firm basis for evaluating how it is modulated by exogenous molecules. To this aim, a powerful method was developed to obtain long-lasting recordings with low access resistance, employing pressure-polished patch pipettes. This method also enabled fast, efficient delivery of molecules via a perfusion system coupled with pulled quartz or plastic <b>perfusion</b> <b>tubes,</b> inserted {{very close to the}} enlarged pipette tip. Sub-saturating flashes elicited responses in different cells with similar rising phase kinetics but with very different recovery kinetics, suggesting the existence of physiologically distinct cones having different Ca 2 + dynamics. Theoretical considerations demonstrate that the different recovery kinetics can be modelled by simulating changes in the Ca 2 +-buffering capacity of the outer segment. Importantly, the Ca 2 +-buffer action preserves the fast response rising phase, when the Ca 2 +-dependent negative feedback is activated by the light-induced decline in intracellular Ca 2 +...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} the human jejunal permeability of cimetidine and ranitidine using a regional jejunal perfusion approach, and to integrate such determinations with previous efforts {{to establish a}} baseline correlation between permeability and fraction dose ab-sorbed in humans for soluble drugs. Methods. A sterile multi-channel <b>perfusion</b> <b>tube,</b> Loc-I-Gut®, was inserted orally and positioned in the proximal region of the jejunum. A solution containing cimetidine or ranitidine and phenylalanine, propranolol, PEG 400, and PEG 4000 was perfused through a 10 cm jejunal segment in 6 and 8 subjects, respectively. Results. The mean Peff (± se) of cimetidine and ranitidine averaged over both phases were 0. 30 (0. 045) and 0. 27 (0. 062) × 10 − 4 cm/s, respectively, and {{the differences between the}} two were found to be statistically insignificant. The mean permeabilities for propranolol, phenylalanine, and PEG 400 averaged over both phases and studies were 3. 88 (0. 72), 3. 36 (0. 50), and 0. 56 (0. 08) × 10 − 4 cm/s, respectively. The differences in permeability for a given marker were not signifi-cant between phases or between the two studies. Conclusions. The 10 -fold lower permeabilities found for cimetidine and ranitidine in this study, compared to propranolol and phenylal-anine, appear to be consistent with their less than complete absorp-tion in humans.

40|$|Background: Enteric {{microorganisms}} {{are responsible}} for {{a significant proportion of}} post-surgical infections. Intestinal mucosal injury may permit translocation of bacteria and endotoxin. This study investigates translocation in peritonitis and ischemia/reperfusion by inoculating different bacterial species into the small intestine. Methods: Twenty-five pigs were monitored hemodynamically and divided into three groups: controls (C), ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), and peritonitis (P). Intramucosal pH (pHi) was calculated tonometrically. A <b>perfusion</b> <b>tube</b> was positioned in the ileum for inoculation of the bacterial strains. In a first study period a non-pathogenic bacterium was used, whereas Escherichia coli strains with known ability to translocate were used in a second. Blood and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were obtained for bacterial culture and endotoxin analyses. Results: Mesenteric arterial blood flow and pHi decreased in groups I/R and P. Endotoxin levels increased in these groups in period 1, whereas in period 2 an increase over time was only observed in group P. No bacterial translocation to blood or MLNs occurred in period 1. In period 2 bacteria translocated to MLNs in all animals, including controls. Translocation to central and/or mesenteric venous blood was found in all groups, but mainly in I/R and P. The incidence of mucosal injury was similar in the two periods. Conclusions: Since positive blood and MLN samples were only found in period 2, we conclude that translocation of bacteria seems to be more dependent on the presence of translocating strains in the intestinal bacterial flora than on the mucosal insult...|$|E
30|$|Given {{the poor}} {{outcomes}} associated with MVCs, identifying {{the risk factors}} and actively preventing MVCs are very important for these patients. It {{is worth noting that}} obesity, concomitant IABP, and SOFA score at 24  h post-ECMO appeared to be significant risk factors for severe limb ischemia. Intriguingly, peripheral arterial disease was not associated with limb ischemia (p[*]=[*] 0.38) in this study. The peripheral arterial disease and absence of a distal perfusion catheter {{has been found to be}} predictors of severe limb ischemia in previous studies [10, 11]. All PCS patients receiving VA-ECMO support were implanted by surgical cut-down and conventional placement of a distal perfusion catheter in this study. Therefore, for the patients with femoral artery stenosis (moderate to severe), surgical cut-down combined with a distal <b>perfusion</b> <b>tube</b> for implantation of VA-ECMO is recommended. Although the incidence of limb ischemia was generally low, IABP has the risk of increasing the risk of limb ischemia [26]. A total of 246 patients (56.9 %) received VA-ECMO combined with IABP support. A total of 235 of these patients (95.5 %) received IABP first but were still unable to maintain hemodynamic stability, and were then given VA-ECMO. The other 11 patients (4.5 %) underwent VA-ECMO first, and received IABP for that opening of the aortic valve were restricted. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the occurrence of limb ischemia when the combined with IABP support is needed. It is worth noting that obesity was a significant risk factor for severe limb ischemia. Although the severe limb ischemia affects the clinical prognosis of those patients, there is still no suitable time for surgical decompression and drainage. In the present study, we found that higher SOFA score at 24  h post-ECMO was associated with increased incidence of MVCs. The clinical conditions of patients with higher SOFA score were more severe, and distal tissue hypoperfusion and thrombocytopenia seemed to be more common in those patients, which might account for our findings. In addition, we also demonstrated that the hemostasis disorders were independently associated with bleeding/hematoma in cannulation site during VA-ECMO support. Further research should focus on prevention and early management of MVCs to avoid devastating consequences.|$|E

This effect was not due to an artefact produced by the entry of secretin-stimulated, bicarbonate-rich, pancreatic juice into the test segment. Absorption of sodium chloride and water was stimulated rather than inhibited by higher bicarbonate concentrations and the effect of secretin was obvious even when this factor was controlled by adjusting the bicarbonate concentrations of the test fluids. Secretin did not influence ion transport in the mid-jejunum. It is suggested that the effects described may indicate a physiological role for secretin in the intestine where it could prevent the too rapid dehydration of upper jejunal contents which might interfere with adequate mixing and digestion...|$|R
40|$|An {{absorption}} {{screen was}} performed in 10 chronic alcoholic patients {{within a few days}} of admission due to an acute alcoholic episode. Impaired absorption of d-Xylose was noted in three patients and low leucocyte ascorbic acid and serum folate levels in five. No abnormality was detected in jejunal histology. The absorption of water and electrolytes from the jejunum was studied in these patients using a triple-lumen <b>tube</b> <b>perfusion</b> system. The mean rate of absorption of water in the alcoholic subjects (50 - 0 +/- 2 - 3 ml/h) was significantly lower (P less than 0 - 001) than the mean value in 14 healthy control subjects (205 +/- 15 - 9 ml/h). A significant reduction of Na+ and Cl-absorption was also demonstrated in the alcoholic subjects. These results indicate that patients with acute-on-chronic alcoholism may have a function impairment of water and electrolyte absorption from the jejunum.

Using a steady state, triple lumen <b>tube</b> <b>perfusion</b> system the absorption of water and electrolytes was measured before and 48 h after administration of the cytotoxic agents.

Brush border disaccharidases did not change at 48 h after chemotherapy, while mature enterocytes appeared normal by both light and electron microscopy. Crypt cells and immature enterocytes, however, showed focal vacuolation by light microscopy, corresponding to the occurrence of large residual bodies (secondary lysosomes) containing partially degraded fragments of damaged crypt cells.

D-xylose absorption after a 25 g oral load was determined in them, and also in 18 additional patients (11 had megaloblastic and seven either hypochromic or haemolytic anaemia). Xylose absorption tests were significantly impaired in the patients with megaloblastic compared with hypochromic or haemolytic anaemia (P less than 0 - 001); those with untreated megaloblastic anaemia had a greater abnormality {{than those who had}} started treatment. Mean glucose, glycine, and folic acid absorption rates were similar to those in controls, and the rates in patients with megaloblastic and hypochromic anaemia were not significantly different. Correlation between glucose absorption rate and xylose excretion was, however, significantly (P less than 0 - 02). If more patients had been studied it seems likely therefore that a significant impairment of glucose absorption rate in the presence of megaloblastic anaemia would also have been demonstrated. In this investigation anaemia per se did not affect glucose, glycine, or folic acid absorption rates or xylose absorption, but xylose absorption was reduced in patients with megaloblastic anaemia. That abnormality was probably related to folate deficiency, and the underlying mechanism seems to be different from that causing impairment of monosaccharide absorption in patients with systemic bacterial infections. Mean glycine and folic acid absorption rates were not altered by megaloblastic anaemia, indicating that folate deficiency does not cause a general depression of absorption...|$|R
40|$|Effect of {{systemic}} bacterial infection on absorption rates of L-histidine and glycyiglycine {{from the human}} jejunum in vivo 1 G. C. Cook, 2 M. D., D. Sc., F. R. C. P. ABSTRACT Jejunal absorption rates of L-histidine (from a 100 mmole/liter solution) and glycylglycine (from a 50 mmole/liter solution) were determined with a double-lumen <b>tube</b> <b>perfusion</b> system in vivo in 12 Zambian African men; six had acute bacterial pneumonia (infection group) and six had no clinical evidence of a bacterial infection (control group). With this experimental design the mean rate of histidine absorption was significantly higher in the infection compared with the control group, but mean rates for glycine absorption from glycylglycine were not significantly different. During the glycylglycine infusions, the luminal disappearance rate of the intact peptide was significantly greater than the total glycine absorption rate. The correlation between individual histidine and glycylglycine absorption rates was significant. That is probably because after intracellular hydrolysis and efflux to the lumen, some glycylglycine is reabsorbed as free glycine by the amino-acid transfer mechanism, {{and the rate of}} that has previously been shown to be increased in subjects with systemic bacterial infections. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 30 : 1994 - 1998, 1977. Acute systemic bacterial infections not involving the intestine have been shown to increase, significantly, the rate of glycine absorption from the human jejunum (1). However, using the same experimental de-sign the absorption rate of glycine from the di-peptide glycylglycine, {{did not seem to be}} altered by similar infections (2). Those find-ings are consistent with the recently ac-cepted concept of separate transfer mecha-nisms for glycine and glycylglycine in man (3 - 5). In the present investigation the ab-sorption rates of another amino acid, L-histidine, and the di-peptide glycylglycine have been compared in 12 Zambian Afri-cans, six of whom had an acute bacterial infection that did not involve the gastroin-testinal tract...|$|R

40|$|Background Small bowel {{obstruction}} (SBO) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common emergent complications of general surgery. Intra-abdominal adhesions are the leading cause of SBO. Because surgery can induce new adhesions, non-operative management is preferred in the absence of signs of peritonitis or strangulation. Oral traditional Chinese herbal medicine has long been used as a non-operative therapy to treat adhesive SBO in China. Many controlled trials have been conducted to investigate its therapeutic value in resolving adhesive SBO. Objectives The aim of this review was to assess the efficacy and safety of oral traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for adhesive small bowel obstruction. Search methods We searched the following databases, without regard to language or publishing restrictions: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure/Chinese Academic Journals full-text Database (CNKI), and VIP (a full-text database of Chinese journals). The searches were conducted in November 2011. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing Chinese medicines administered orally, via the gastric canal, or both with a placebo or conventional therapy in participants diagnosed with adhesive SBO were considered. We also considered trials of TCM (oral administration, gastric <b>tube</b> <b>perfusion,</b> or both) plus conventional therapy compared with conventional therapy alone for patients with adhesive SBO. Studies addressing the safety and efficacy of oral traditional Chinese medicinal agents in the treatment of adhesive SBO were also considered. Data collection and analysis Two authors collected the data independently. We assessed the risk of bias according to the following methodological criteria: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias. Dichotomous data are presented as risk ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI); continuous outcomes are presented as mean differences (MD) and 95 % CIs. The data analyses were carried out using Review Manager 5. 1. For cases in which necessary information was not reported in the paper, we contacted the primary authors for additional information. Main results Five randomised trials involving 664 participants were analysed. Five different herbal medicines were tested in these trials, including Huo-Xue-Tong-Fu decoction, Xiao-Cheng-Qi-Tang decoction, a combination of Xiao-Cheng-Qi-Tang and Si-Jun-Zi-Tang decoctions, Chang-Nian-Lian-Song-Jie-Tang decoction, and Fufang-Da-Cheng-Qi-Tang decoction. There were variations in the tested herbal compositions and methods of medicine administration. The main outcomes reported in the trials were effects on abdominal pain, abdominal distension, constipation defection, time of first defecation after treatment, and reoperation rate during the course of the disease. Secondary outcomes selected for this review were not available, including complications such as small bowel perfusion (bowel resection, system complications, and other possible complications), length of hospital stay, cost of hospitalisation, and time from admission to surgical intervention. The results of five trials showed that patients receiving TCM combined with conventional therapy seemed to have improved outcomes compared with patients receiving conventional treatment alone (OR 4. 24, 95 % CI 2. 83 to 6. 36). However, we cannot conclusively determine the efficacy of TCM in this review due to inadequate reporting, low methodological quality, and the prevalence of various biases in the reviewed studies. Furthermore, because none of the reviewed trials discussed adverse events, we could not evaluate the safety of TCM for adhesive SBO patients. All trials were conducted and published in China. Authors' conclusions Although many studies have assessed the use of TCM products for adhesive SBO, most were excluded from this review due to their methodological limitations. This systematic review did not find sufficient evidence to support the objective efficacy and safety of TCM for patients with adhesive SBO. The positive evidence should be interpreted with caution given the insufficient number of studies with large sample sizes, the absence of well-designed, high-quality trials, and the lack of safety information. Therefore, further studies with larger sample sizes and high-quality, randomised, and controlled trials are necessary to produce more accurate and meaningful data on the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicines for adhesive SBO...|$|R

Enquist Corresponding author ([lenquist@princeton. edu](lenquist@princeton. edu)). ### INTRODUCTION Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a neuroinvasive virus of the herpes {{family that}} has a broad host range but does not infect higher-order primates. PRV {{characteristically}} travels along chains of synaptically connected neurons and has been used extensively for elucidating neural circuits in the peripheral and central nervous system in vivo. The recombinant virus PRV 369 is an attenuated retrograde tracer that encodes G-CaMP 2, a fluorescent calcium sensor protein that is stable at physiological pH and mammalian temperature. This protocol describes the use of PRV 369 to express G-CaMP 2 in a neuronal circuit and to monitor its activity in a living animal, specifically in the submandibular ganglia (SMG), the peripheral parasympathetic ganglia that innervate the salivary glands. The procedure describes the delivery of PRV 369 to the glands and shows how SMG neurons can then be imaged post-inoculation to explore connectivity and activity. ### RELATED INFORMATION Additional information {{on the use of}} PRVs for tracing neural circuitry in vivo is described in Song et al. (2005). Specific information on the recombinant PRV 369 is available in Granstedt et al. (2009). Background on the properties and uses of G-CaMP 2 is also available (Nakai et al. 2001; Ohkura et al. 2005; Tallini et al. 2006; Hoogland et al. 2009). PRV has a broad host range, infecting almost all mammals and some avian embryos (except higher primates including humans). Therefore, this technology is expected to work in any species susceptible to PRV infection. For an example of an SMG infected by PRV 369 and spontaneous calcium transients imaged with two-photon microscopy, see Figure 1. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. Example of an SMG infected by PRV 369. Spontaneous calcium transients were imaged with two-photon microscopy 48 hours post-inoculation (hpi). Scale bar = 20 μm.

Anesthetize the animal by injecting intraperitoneally with 16 μL ketamine/xylazine per gram of body weight. - *Wait until the animal is anesthetized by checking paw-pinch withdrawal and corneal reflexes before continuing*. - Lay the animal on its back on a piece of cardboard. Immobilize the limbs with tape. Stretch back the nose by securing a rubber band across the mouth. - Monitor the animal during the entire surgical procedure and test the depth of anesthesia regularly (e. g., by controlling respiratory rate and paw-pinch withdrawal reflex). - Using an alcohol swab, wet the neck area {{from the base of the}} chin to just above the ribcage. - Use a razor blade to shave away the hair, exposing the skin. - Use cotton-tipped applicators to apply disinfectant solution/surgical scrub to the shaved area. Finish by swabbing with 70 % ethanol. - Grasp the skin with forceps. Use a sterile scalpel to make a shallow incision ~ 1. 5 -cm long from the ribcage to the chin. - Gently detach the glands from the skin using tissue separator scissors. - The salivary glands are located immediately below the skin, and adhere to it via layers of connective tissue. - Rinse the Hamilton syringe with DPBS before drawing up PRV inoculum. - Using the Hamilton syringe, inject 5 μL of the PRV 369 into each side of the salivary glands: - i. Inject PRV into one side of the salivary gland by making two to three separate injections in the center. - ii. Keep the syringe in place for ~ 10 sec at each injection site. - iii. Repeat with the other side. - Injecting in both the left and right glands doubles the chance of finding infected cells and reduces the number of animals used. - Close the incision with silk sutures. Apply disinfectant solution to the sutured area. - For post-operative analgesia, inject 5 μL of the diluted buprenorphine per gram of body weight intraperitoneally. - Keep the mouse on a heating blanket at 37 °C until it recovers. Put the animal in a new cage by itself. **In Vivo Imaging of Fluorescent Indicator in SMG Neurons** 13. At the desired time post-inoculation, anesthetize the animal for ~ 10 min in an isoflurane chamber using 2 % isoflurane. 14. Place the animal on its back on the imaging stage. Position the animal’s nose in the isoflurane cone. Tape down all limbs. 15. Insert the rectal temperature probe. Turn on the heating blanket to keep the animal’s temperature at 37 °C. 16. Under a dissection microscope, use stitch scissors to remove the sutures. 17. Use tissue-separator scissors to separate the glands from the skin. With the aid of retractors, pull open the skin to better expose the glands. - *Healthy glands have lobules and appear pinkish gray. It is rare to detect any damage in the glands from the first surgery. Even if some inflammation occurs in the glands, it does not affect imaging in the submandibular neurons*. 18. Using fine forceps to cut connective tissue, locate the SMG anterior to one of the salivary glands. - *The SMGs are located along the salivary duct and surrounded by connective tissue. They appear as small translucent beads. Healthy ganglia should have detectable capillaries with blood flow*. 19. Lift the ganglion onto a small metal platform that is controlled by a micromanipulator. - *Apply some tension so that the ganglion stays in place*. 20. Move the stage from the dissection microscope to an upright imaging microscope. Perfuse the area with warm mammalian Ringer’s solution. 21. Image calcium transients with a one-photon wavelength of 480 nm (or two-photon excitation at 920 nm) and with a 500 - to 550 -nm bandpass emission filter. - *Labeled cells will have dim background fluorescence that fills the soma compared with nonlabeled cells. Transients are bright and can be seen in the raw movies. See Troubleshooting*. ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: Fluorescence intensity of infected cells is low. **[Step 21]** - **Solution**: The fluorescence quantum efficiency of G-CaMP 2 is only in the range of wild-type green fluorescent protein (GFP) at typical intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations. As a result, infected cells might be hard to find because they are only slightly brighter than autofluorescent cells. Because excessive excitation leads to bleaching, take averaged images without increasing excitation intensity. Search for cells that are brighter than the average cell. Typical calcium signals in vivo increase the intensity by 40 % and last longer than a second, making them easily detectable. Note that bleaching accelerates when calcium (and therefore fluorescence) is elevated. ### DISCUSSION PRV 369 provides the capability to reliably detect neuronal activity by expression of a fluorescent calcium indicator protein in intact circuits in living animals. It is isogenic with PRV Bartha strains encoding GFP (PRV 152; Smith et al. 2000) and red fluorescent protein (PRV 614; Banfield et al. 2003), two of the most frequently used PRV-based viral circuit tracers. PRV 369 should therefore be useful in circuits previously elucidated by these tracers. The endogenous activity of PRV 369 -labeled neurons can be monitored early on with minimal effects caused by infection. However, at later time points in infection, the number of infected cells and calcium transient frequency increases significantly, perhaps indicating cell and tissue responses to infection (Granstedt et al. 2009). The described approach for labeling and monitoring activity in the SMGs can be generalized to other circuits. Although not all types of circuits have been explored with PRV, to our knowledge PRV has labeled every circuit tested. However, for each circuit the precise time window for reliable imaging must be determined empirically by measuring the time course of infection spread through the|$|R
