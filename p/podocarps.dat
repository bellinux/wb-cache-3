5|$|New Zealand's {{geographic}} isolation for 80 million years and island biogeography has influenced {{evolution of the}} country's species of animals, fungi and plants. Physical isolation has not caused biological isolation, and this {{has resulted in a}} dynamic evolutionary ecology with examples of very distinctive plants and animals as well as populations of widespread species. About 82% of New Zealand's indigenous vascular plants are endemic, covering 1,944 species across 65 genera and includes a single endemic family. The number of fungi recorded from New Zealand, including lichen-forming species, is not known, nor is the proportion of those fungi which are endemic, but one estimate suggests there are about 2,300 species of lichen-forming fungi in New Zealand and 40% of these are endemic. The two main types of forest are those dominated by broadleaf trees with emergent <b>podocarps,</b> or by southern beech in cooler climates. The remaining vegetation types consist of grasslands, the majority of which are tussock.|$|E
25|$|Australia and New Guinea are {{portions}} of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana, which started to break into smaller continents in the Cretaceous era, 66–130million years ago. Australia finally broke free from Antarctica about 45million years ago. All the Australasian lands are home to the Antarctic flora, descended from the flora of southern Gondwana, including the coniferous <b>podocarps</b> and Araucaria pines, and the broadleafed southern beech (Nothofagus). These plant families are still present in Papua New Guinea.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the clay}} soil {{is not very}} fertile, the high {{rainfall}} and warm weather mean that the island is densely forested throughout. Native plants include the world's southernmost dense forest of <b>podocarps</b> (southern conifers) and hardwoods such as rātā and kāmahi in the lowland areas with mānuka shrubland at higher elevations. The trees {{are thought to have}} become established here since the last ice age from seeds brought across the strait by seabirds, which would explain why the beech trees that are so common in New Zealand, but whose seeds are dispersed by the wind rather than birds, are not found on Stewart Island.|$|E
50|$|Podocarpus spinulosus, the Dwarf Plum Pine or Spiny-leaf <b>Podocarp,</b> is {{a species}} of <b>podocarp</b> native to the warm-temperate coastal regions of New South Wales and {{southern}} Queensland. It is generally an understorey shrub, rarely growing more than 2 m tall.|$|R

25|$|Millions {{of years}} ago, Antarctica was warmer and much wetter, and {{supported}} the Antarctic flora, including forests of <b>podocarps</b> and southern beech. Antarctica was {{also part of the}} ancient supercontinent of Gondwanaland, which gradually broke up by continental drift starting 110 million years ago. The separation of South America from Antarctica 30-35 million years ago allowed the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to form, which isolated Antarctica climatically and caused it to become much colder. The Antarctic flora subsequently died out in Antarctica, but is still {{an important component of the}} flora of southern Neotropic (South America) and Australasia, which were also former parts of Gondwana.|$|E
500|$|It {{seems that}} the kakapo – like many of New Zealand's bird species – has evolved to occupy an {{ecological}} niche normally filled by various species of mammal (the only non-marine mammals native to New Zealand are [...] ). Before the arrival of humans, the kakapo was distributed throughout the three main islands of New Zealand. It lived {{in a variety of}} habitats, including tussocklands, scrublands and coastal areas. It also inhabited forests dominated by <b>podocarps</b> (rimu, matai, kahikatea, totara), beeches, tawa, and rata. In Fiordland, areas of avalanche and slip debris with regenerating and heavily fruiting vegetation – such as five finger, wineberry, bush lawyer, tutu, hebes, and coprosmas – became known as [...] "kakapo gardens".|$|E
500|$|The Catlins {{features}} dense temperate rainforest, {{dominated by}} <b>podocarps.</b> This {{is the largest}} area of native forest remaining on the South Island's east coast, with over [...] of forest and neighbouring subalpine areas being protected in Catlins Conservation Park. The forest is thick with trees such as rimu, totara, silver beech, matai and kahikatea. Of particular note are the virgin rimu and totara forest remaining in those areas which were too rugged or steep to have been milled by early settlers, and an extensive area of silver beech forest close to the Takahopa River. This is New Zealand's most southerly expanse of beech forest. Many native species of forest plant {{can be found in}} the undergrowth of the Catlins forest, including young lancewoods, orchids such as the spider orchid and perching Easter orchid, and many different native ferns.|$|E
50|$|Podocarpus nubigenus (also {{known as}} Podocarpus nubigena) is {{a species of}} <b>podocarp,</b> endemic to the Valdivian {{temperate}} rain forests of southern Chile and adjacent southwestern Argentina. It is the southernmost <b>podocarp</b> in the world, It grows from 38° to Ultima Esperanza (53° South latitude), It grows in wet and swampy soils. It can settle clear grounds, with a faster growth than the other Chilean podocarpaceae.|$|R

25|$|At {{the time}} of the Treaty of Waitangi being {{negotiated}} and signed in January and February 1840, Calton Hill was probably by then a mosaic of tussock grassland and bracken shrubland with pockets of <b>podocarp</b> and broadleaf forest in steep gullies. Botanical records indicate the Calton Hill area that once was covered in dense <b>podocarp,</b> broadleaf forest had been displaced by human-lit fires. In the years prior to this it is unlikely the area would have been used by the small number of Europeans who inhabited the country.|$|R
2500|$|The arid, {{continental}} conditions {{characteristic of}} the Triassic steadily eased during the Jurassic period, especially at higher latitudes; the warm, humid climate allowed lush jungles to cover much of the landscape. Conifers dominated the flora, as during the Triassic; {{they were the most}} diverse group and constituted the majority of large trees. Extant conifer families that flourished during the Jurassic included the Araucariaceae, Cephalotaxaceae, Pinaceae, Podocarpaceae, Taxaceae and Taxodiaceae. The extinct Mesozoic conifer family Cheirolepidiaceae dominated low latitude vegetation, as did the shrubby Bennettitales. Cycads were also common, as were ginkgos and tree ferns in the forest. Smaller ferns were probably the dominant undergrowth. Caytoniaceous seed ferns were another group of important plants during this time and are thought to have been shrub to small-tree sized. Ginkgo-like plants were particularly common in the mid- to high northern latitudes. In the Southern Hemisphere, <b>podocarps</b> were especially successful, while Ginkgos [...] and Czekanowskiales were rare.|$|E
50|$|Nageia, {{like many}} <b>podocarps,</b> {{can usually be}} found {{scattered}} throughout the forest mixed with other trees, and is rarely if ever found growing in pure stands. The wood is yellowish, typical of <b>podocarps,</b> and a few species are locally important for lumber.|$|E
50|$|The <b>podocarps</b> are {{associated}} with the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana, where they were characteristic of the cool, moist southern Gondwana flora. Gondwana broke up into the continents of South America, Africa, India, Australia, and Antarctica between 160 and 30 million years ago. As Africa drifted north, it became hotter and drier, and the <b>podocarps</b> generally retreated to the cool, moist highlands of eastern and southern Africa.|$|E
50|$|Nageia is a genus of {{conifers}} {{belonging to}} the <b>podocarp</b> family Podocarpaceae. Nageia includes evergreen shrubs and trees, from one to 54 meters in height. A 2009 treatment of the genus recognized five species. Some authors consider Nageia formosensis to be a separate species from Nageia nagi, thus recognizing six species. The <b>podocarp</b> genera have been reshuffled by various botanists. Most recently, several species formerly classed as Nageia were moved to the new genus Retrophyllum, while Nageia falcata and Nageia mannii were moved to the new genus Afrocarpus.|$|R

40|$|The growth {{response}} of Pinus radiata D. Don seedlings was measured for 3 {{years after the}} clearfelling and harvesting of a Nothofagus spp. forest using the following treatments: <b>podocarp</b> logging only; <b>podocarp</b> logging and burning; logging of all tree species to chipwood standard (1 (} cm dbh); chip wood logging and burning; with or without fertiliser and/or herbicide treatments. Seedling mortality 3 years after planting exceeded 55 % in the unburned treatments but was less than 39 % in the burned treatments. Height and diameter growth was better in the burned than the unburned treatments, and in the chipwood rather than with the <b>podocarp</b> logged plots. Fertiliser application produced no measurable effect on seedling growth rates but herbicide application induced a small growth increase. Nutrient levels in the soil and foliage were adequate {{for the needs of}} P. radia,ta. Few of the interactions between burning, logging method, fertiliser, and herbicide application were significant...|$|R
50|$|The {{temperate}} rainforests of New Zealand {{occur on}} the western shore of the South Island and on the North Island. The forests {{are made up of}} coniferous <b>podocarps</b> and broadleaf evergreen trees. The <b>podocarps</b> are abundant at lower elevations, while southern beech (Nothofagus) can be found on higher slopes and in the cooler southernmost rainforests. Ecoregions include the Fiordland temperate forests and Westland temperate rainforests.|$|E
50|$|The history, {{climate and}} geology of New Zealand {{have created a}} great deal of {{diversity}} in New Zealand's vegetation types. The main two types of forest have been dominated by <b>podocarps</b> and southern beech. <b>Podocarps</b> (Podocarpaceae), an ancient evergreen gymnosperm family of trees, have changed little in the last 190 million years. Forests dominated by <b>podocarps</b> form a closed canopy with an understory of hardwoods and shrubs. The forests of southern beeches, from the genus Nothofagus, comprise a less diverse habitat, with the beeches of four species dominating the canopy and allowing a single understory. In the north of New Zealand the podocarp forests were dominated by the ancient giant kauri. These trees are amongst the largest in the world, holding the record for the greatest timber volume of any tree. The value of this was not lost on early European settlers, and most of these trees were felled.|$|E
50|$|An example {{occurrence}} of L. juniperina {{is in the}} red and silver beech forests admixed with rimu and miro <b>podocarps</b> on northern South Island, New Zealand; associate understory species in this South Island forest include Blechnum discolor.|$|E
2500|$|Commonly used {{synonyms}} for {{the species}} are Carpocapsa saltitans or Laspeyresia saltitans [...] carpo indicating that it lives within a seed (see <b>podocarp),</b> and saltitans referring to its jumping behavior.|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} <b>podocarp</b> forest contains 500- to 600-year-old matai, totara and kahikatea {{trees as}} well as fruit and flowering species such as kowhai, ribbonwood, mahoe, cabbage trees, kanuka and fuchsia.|$|R
50|$|Prumnopitys is a genus of {{conifers}} {{belonging to}} the <b>podocarp</b> family Podocarpaceae. The eight recognized species of Prumnopitys are densely branched, dioecious evergreen trees up to 40 metres in height.|$|R
50|$|The {{fourth and}} last type is the Northern Patagonian forests, which {{dominate}} the southern {{half of the}} ecoregion, with evergreen species such as the broadleaf Nothofagus dombeyi and Drimys winteri and the coniferous <b>podocarps,</b> including Podocarpus nubigenus.|$|E
50|$|The fossilised {{remains of}} a forest from the Pleistocene era are located at Titahi Bay and form an {{intertidal}} reef. The forest was dominated by <b>podocarps</b> and tree-ferns and dates from the last interglacial period 150,000-70,000 years ago.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} {{bush has}} some very large trees such as rimu and rata, which {{are estimated to be}} between 400 and 800 years old. Large conifers (<b>podocarps)</b> such as rimu, totara, miro and matai can be viewed from the Canopy Walkway or the Nature Trail.|$|E
40|$|Leaf floras in fluvial-lacustrine sediments of the Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian-Turonian) {{portion of}} the Winton Formation suggest a {{community}} with co-dominance of angiosperms, conifers, ginkgo and other seed plants. To date wood floras associated with the Winton Formation have not been examined in detail. Winton Formation wood has been presumed to comprise araucarian, <b>podocarp</b> and taxodiaceous components, but this has been based largely on the identification of other plant macro and microfossils. Here we describe a new species of <b>podocarp</b> fossil wood from the genus Protophyllodadoxylon based on eleven specimens of silicified wood found as surface material at two broadly coeval sites in the Cenomanian-Turonian {{portion of the}} Winton Formation: QM L 311 and Bladensburg National Park. The new species is characterised {{by the presence of}} araucaroid tracheid pitting and phyllodadoid oopores, the absence of oculipores, and the paired arrangement of the oopores within the crossfields. The recognition of Protophyllocladoxylon in the Winton Formation supports previous palynological frequency counts that suggest a dominance of <b>podocarp</b> conifers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.
