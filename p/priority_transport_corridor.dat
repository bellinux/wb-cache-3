Based on the analytic hierarchy process, this paper established the dry port index system to evaluate the potential location of dry ports linked to the port system in the Pearl River Delta, in a case study covering 115 cities in the Pan - Pearl River Delta. The results show that it is optimal to locate 21 dry ports in the research region, and each dry port serves different areas. There are 4 optimal <b>transport</b> <b>corridors</b> for the dry port logistic network, including Guangzhou- Kunming <b>transport</b> <b>corridor,</b> Guangzhou-Chengdu <b>transport</b> <b>corridor,</b> Guangzhou-Changsha <b>transport</b> <b>corridor</b> and Shenzhen-Nanchang <b>transport</b> <b>corridor...</b>|$|R

40|$|After half {{a century}} of {{corridor}} development in Europe, the corridor concept is well-established in the academic discourse on transportation. <b>Transport</b> <b>corridors</b> have also been common practice in European transport policy since the creation of a borderless Europe in the 1990 s. What is largely lacking in present-day research on European <b>transport</b> <b>corridors</b> is a consideration of a sectortranscendent and comprehensive spatial approach. We argue that adopting such an approach is beneficial to a valued analysis of European <b>transport</b> <b>corridors,</b> especially in the light of EU cohesion policy, agglomeration effects and place-based development. Also, negative external effects of persisting bottlenecks on welfare and quality of life in <b>transport</b> <b>corridors</b> should be better assessed and contextualised. This paper therefore suggests that policy can and should capitalise more on spatiality in corridors...|$|R
