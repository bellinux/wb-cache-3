40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{of an active}} control landing gear (ACOLAG) was developed and programmed for operation on a digital computer. The {{mathematical model}} includes theoretical subsonic aerodynamics; first-mode wing bending and torsional characteristics; oleo-pneumatic shock strut with fit and binding friction; closed-loop, series-hydraulic control; empirical tire force-deflection characteristics; antiskid braking; and sinusoidal or random runway roughness. The mathematical model was used to compute the loads and motions for a simulated vertical drop test and a simulated landing impact of a conventional (passive) main landing gear designed for a 2268 -kg (5000 -lbm) class airplane. Computations were also made for a simply {{modified version of the}} <b>passive</b> <b>gear</b> including a series-hydraulic active control system. Comparison of computed results for the <b>passive</b> <b>gear</b> with experimental data shows that the active control landing gear analysis is valid for predicting the loads and motions of an airplane during a symmetrical landing. Computed results for the series-hydraulic active control in conjunction with the simply modified <b>passive</b> <b>gear</b> show that 20 - to 30 -percent reductions in wing force, relative to those occurring with the modified <b>passive</b> <b>gear,</b> can be obtained during the impact phase of the landing.

40|$|To {{implement}} {{an ecosystem}} approach to fisheries management, {{there is a}} need to characterize the total pressure exerted by fisheries at the community level. French onboard observer data were used to derive catch metrics and compare fishing distribution across community components between two sites in the Southern Bay of Biscay. Sample-based rarefaction curves were used to standardize metrics across different active and <b>passive</b> <b>gears,</b> and correct for sample size differences. Six metrics for species, length and functional catch composition were tested. Length and functional metrics were found the most relevant metrics to highlight differences in catches between gears, sites, and gear-site interactions. Significant differences were found between gears, mainly in mean length and proportion of piscivores. None of the gears had the most diverse catch across all metrics. Small differences were found between sites, mainly in length range and species richness...|$|R
40|$|Skeletal muscles change {{length and}} develop force both passively and actively. Gearing allows muscle fiber length changes to be {{uncoupled}} {{from those of}} the whole muscle-tendon unit. During active contractions this process allows muscles to operate at mechanically favorable conditions for power or economical force production. Here we ask whether gearing is constant in passive muscle; determining the relationship between fascicle and muscle-tendon unit length change in the bi-articular medial gastrocnemius and investigating the influence of whether motion occurs at the knee or ankle joint. Specifically, the same muscle-tendon unit length changes were elicited by rotating either the ankle or knee joint whilst simultaneously measuring fascicle lengths in proximal and distal muscle regions using B-mode ultrasound. In both the proximal and distal muscle region, <b>passive</b> <b>gearing</b> values differed depending on whether ankle or knee motion occurred. Fascicle length changes were greater with ankle motion, likely reflecting anatomical differences in proximal and distal passive tendinous tissues, as well as shape changes of the adjacent mono-articular soleus. This suggests that there is joint-dependent dissociation between the mechanical behavior of muscle fibers and the muscle-tendon unit during passive joint motions that may be important to consider when developing accurate models of bi-articular muscles...|$|R
40|$|Seals {{and humans}} often target the same food resource, leading to competition. This is of {{mounting}} concern with fish stocks in global decline. Grey seals were tracked from southeast Ireland, {{an area of}} mixed demersal and pelagic fisheries, and overlap with fisheries on the Celtic Shelf and Irish Sea was assessed. Overall, there was low overlap between the tagged seals and fisheries. However, when we separate active (e. g. trawls) and <b>passive</b> <b>gear</b> (e. g. nets, lines) fisheries, a different picture emerged. Overlap with active fisheries was no different from that expected under a random distribution, but overlap with passive fisheries was significantly higher. This suggests that grey seals may be targeting the same areas as passive fisheries and/or specifically targeting <b>passive</b> <b>gear.</b> There was variation in foraging areas between individual seals suggesting habitat partitioning to reduce intra-specific competition or potential individual specialisation in foraging behaviour. Our findings support other recent assertions that seal/fisheries interactions in Irish waters are an issue in inshore passive fisheries, most likely at the operational and individual level. This suggests that seal population management measures would be unjustifiable, and mitigation is best focused on minimizing interactions at nets...|$|E

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{discipline of}} gear selectivity research {{has a long}} tradition that can be traced back hundreds of years. This note aims at giving a short review of central aspects of size selectivity analysis of data from experiments with towed fishing gears. It is thus not intended as a technical introduction to the analysis. More detailed descriptions can be found elsewhere in the literature. SINGLE HAUL ANALY SES Experiments with towed can be conducted by different methods. The most commonly used are covered codend and paired gear techniques. These are characterized by collecting fish in two compartments one of which is assumed virtually non-selective. The purpose of the non-selective compartment is to collect information about the local abundance of fish that entered the combined gear. With the appearance of more complicated gear with multiple selective devices (e. g. grids or panels) the experimental gears have also developed into more complex designs. The most important advancement in the analysis of single hauls was done by Millar in 1992, when he developed the SELECT method. The method is very general and covers not only all types of size selectivity experiments with towed gears but also experiments with <b>passive</b> <b>gears,</b> i. e. hooks, set-net...|$|R

40|$|Inter-Research 2014. Catchability, a key {{parameter}} {{in stock}} assessment, is often considered constant {{in time and}} space. However, when fishing with <b>passive</b> <b>gears</b> like traps or gillnets, fish behavior determines the odds of encounter with the fishers and thus catchability. Few studies have presented comprehensive empirical evidence {{of the link between}} behavior measured in the wild and catchability from a life-history strategy perspective. Here, a suite of different variables, including environmental cues, physiological states, fish activity, home range and catchability, were modeled using a sinusoidal function to describe their seasonality over the year and the degree of coupling among them in a sedentary coastal fish (Labrus bergylta). All the variables except the home range size showed a significant variation over the year, following a sinusoidal pattern. The models showed a tight match between the seasonality of catchability and fish activity, with high values of both variables occurring in late spring to early summer, when the highest levels of feeding and the period of reproductive inactivity occurred. Lower catchability values were predicted in late autumn to early winter, coinciding with the spawning season and the associated reduced activity. This integrative research shows that the spatio-temporal dimension of fish life-history strategy has a key role in shaping catchability even in highly sedentary species. Time-varying catchability needs to be incorporated into stock assessment models that aim to accurately describe fish population health and to estimate abundance indices. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Anticipating fisher {{behaviour}} {{is necessary}} for successful fisheries management. Of the different concepts {{that have been developed}} to understand individual fisher behaviour, random utility models (RUMs) have attracted considerable attention in the past three decades, and more particularly so since the 2000 s. This study aimed at summarizing and analysing the information gathered from RUMs used during the last three decades around the globe. A methodology has been developed to standardize information across different studies and compare RUM results. The studies selected focused on fishing effort allocation. Six types of fisher behaviour drivers were considered: the presence of other vessels in the same fishing area, tradition, expected revenue, species targeting, costs, and risk-taking. Analyses were performed using three separate linear modelling approaches to assess {{the extent to which these}} different drivers impacted fisher behaviour in three fleet types: fleets fishing for demersal species using active gears, fleets fishing for demersal species using <b>passive</b> <b>gears</b> and fleets fishing for pelagic species. Fishers are attracted by higher expected revenue, tradition, species targeting and presence of others, but avoid choices involving large costs. Results also suggest that fishers fishing for demersal species using active gears are generally more influenced by past seasonal (long-term) patterns than by the most recent (short-term) information. Finally, the comparison of expected revenue with other fisher behaviour drivers highlights that demersal fishing vessels are risk-averse and that tradition and species targeting influence fisher decisions more than expected revenue. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Small-scale {{fisheries}} {{are characterized}} by a high diversification of fishing strategies and a highly dynamic pattern of their use {{in time and space}} that complicate data collection and management. Ignoring this variability can produce an incomplete image of the fisheries dynamics and thus can lead to the implementation of inappropriate regulations. In the present study we analyzed the fishing dynamics of the small-scale fleet operating around the Cíes Islands, situated in the marine National Park of Illas Atlánticas (Galicia, NW Spain). In spite of this protection figure created in 2002, no spatially-explicit information on the fishing system in the area is currently available and no specific management is applied. Fishery information systems in Galicia are related only to the landing ports, and the spatial aspects of the fishing operations are not available despite their importance for assessment and management. We carried out interviews with the fishers to first identify the fleet from nearby base ports operating in the Cíes Islands, and then to obtain temporal patterns of effort and catch data. A series of hierarchical cluster analyses of the individual monthly catch profiles was performed to identify the fishing strategies and to study their temporal dynamics. The Cíes fleet was composed of 565 boats coming from 11 ports of the South of Galicia. Although purse seine vessels were present in the park, the fishing effort was mainly exerted by the artisanal segment (vessels less than 12 m long using mobile and <b>passive</b> <b>gears)</b> because it was the largest sector in terms of number of boats. We identified 19 active and <b>passive</b> fishing <b>gears</b> operating in the Cíes Islands. Eight of them were selective gears (traps, clam rakes, and manual harvesting) which were specialized in capturing a single target species. In contrast, the remaining gears were multispecies (trammel nets, purse seine nets, gillnets, longlines, trawl) with a different catch species composition depending on the season, mesh size and the fishing zone. Thus, we identified up to 7 fishing strategies practiced with the same gear and aimed to catch different target species. In total 33 fishing strategies operating in Cíes Islands were described, being the most used ones: pots targeting common octopus and velvet crab; gillnet targeting hake and pouting; trammel net targeting either European spider crab or Ballan wrasse; clam rakes; and manual harvesting for goose-barnacles and razor shells. The main season in which each fishing strategy was used changed according to the fishing policy (e. g. closed seasons for target species or fishing gears), the fish prices, and the temporal variation in the abundance of target species...|$|R

Also, mean catches decreased in the months of February and August, corresponding to the peak of dry season and the so-called 'August break', respectively. Catches from active gears (seine, push net) varied among the moon phases too, with a main peak during full moon, and the minimum catch was recorded during the first moon quarter.

Using 7 years of Long-Term Resource Monitoring Program (LTRMP) data collected from the unimpounded upper Mississippi River, we investigated assemblages in two main-channel-border physical hab-itats—those with wing dikes and those without wing dikes. Fishes were captured using daytime electrofishing, mini-fyke netting, large hoop netting, and small hoop netting. Our objectives were to (1) assess associations among fish species richness, physical measurements, and main-channel-border physical habitats using stepwise multiple regression and indicator variables; (2) identify abundant adult and young-of-year (age- 0) families in both physical habitats to further investigate assemblage composition; and (3) calculate standardized species richness estimates within each physical habitat for adult and age- 0 fishes to provide additional information on community struc-ture. We found species richness was greater at wing dikes for both adult and age- 0 fishes when compared with main channel borders.

40|$|The {{profitability}} of groups of {{vessels in the}} Baltic Sea cod fisheries is studied regarding two theoretical future cod availabilities. The main scenarios are: future cod quotas according to ICES forecasts and future cod quotas according to historic high records {{at the level of}} all time high landings in the 1980 ´s. The main scenarios are combined with three alternative number of days at sea as well as with or without capacity change. Capacity is illustrated by number of vessels. The 2008 catches of these vessels resulted in a low gross value added per vessel that does not cover investments and a decent wage. This situation will be changed with increasing cod quotas, however the level might not be satisfactory for all segments, especially the ones fishing with <b>passive</b> <b>gears.</b> The outcome of this analysis demonstrates that historic high landings would lead to increased gross value added per vessel in most scenarios and groups of vessels, even with an increased capacity. If the capacity is kept at the level of 2008 the number of days at sea needs to increase more or less dramatically in all groups of vessels to be able to fish the entire quota at the ICES forecast. With a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) at a level of historic high landings, the number of days at sea would have to increase dramatically if capacity is to be kept unchanged. This means that for some groups of vessels it would be practically impossible to use that many days at sea. To achieve a reasonable gross value added (profitability), and a reasonable wage, a reallocation of fishing opportunities is necessary...|$|R

Few incidental catch data were available for most species, although {{a substantial amount of}} information has recently become available for species in the North Pacific Ocean and the Northwest Atlantic Ocean off Eastern Canada. Incidental catches in <b>passive</b> <b>gear</b> appear to be of sufficient magnitude to have contributed to population declines of northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) and Kuril seals (Phoca vitulina stejnegeri) in the North Pacific and harp seals (P. groenlandica) from the Barents Sea.

40|$|Harvesting {{wild animals}} may exert size-independent {{selection}} pressures {{on a range}} of morphological, life history, and behavioral traits. Most work so far has focused on selection pressures on life history traits and body size as morphological trait. We studied here how recreational fishing selects for morphological traits related to body shape, which may correlate with underlying swimming behavior. Using landmark-based geometric morphometrics, we found consistent recreational fishing-induced selection pressures on body shape in two recreationally exploited marine fish species. We show that individuals with larger-sized mouths and more streamlined and elongated bodies were more vulnerable to passively operated hook-and-line fishing independent of the individual's body size or condition. While the greater vulnerability of individuals with larger mouth gapes {{can be explained by the}} direct physical interaction with hooks, selection against streamlined and elongated individuals could either involve a specific foraging mode or relate to underlying elevated swimming behavior. Harvesting using <b>passive</b> <b>gear</b> is common around the globe, and thus, size-independent selection on body shape is expected to be widespread potentially leaving behind individuals with smaller oral gapes and more compact bodies.

40|$|Feeding {{habits of}} many animals {{have been used}} widely in animal classifications. This is so, because the type of diet an {{organism}} requires demands structural specialisation which will utilise the available resource. Many animals may however have many structural modifications {{to enable them to}} be described as omnivourous or generalised feeders such as H. empodisma and H. riponianus (GREENWOOD 1960) which may show varying degrees of structural and adaptational intermediacy between two trophic groups. Generally, however, the diet of many animals including fish changes as the animal grow larger. The change in structural modifications is usually correlated with changes in the diet. In fishes the change may involve change from tricuspid to biscuspid and finally to unicuspid type of teeth. The degree of modification in the structure depends on the diet, thus Haplochromis that feeds on soft tissues of snails only requires modifications in oral dentition while Haplochromis that feeds on both soft tissues and shells of snails require modification in the lower pharyngeal bone for grinding purposes. Other modifications connected with food utilisation may be located in the alimentary canal. (I) The fish species that are commercially exploited are Protopterus aethiopicus, Clarias mossambicus, Tilapia esculenta, Tilapia amphimelas and Tilapia hybrids. The other fish species present in the lake but not commercially exploited are: Gnathonemus sp. Alestes sp. Labeo sp., Barbus paludinoses, Barbus jacksoni, Barbus lineomaculatus, Barbus regersi, Leptogrlanis sp., Schilbe sp., Haplochromis spp. and Hemihaplochromis sp. (2) Protopterus sp. and Clarias sp. are mostly caught with hooks on long lines. There has been a steady increase in number of hooks on the lake. Since the stocks of Protopterus and C/arias in the lake have a limit, we should control the number of hooks used by each of the fishermen in order to avoid overharvesting. (3) All the previous studies on Lake Kitangiri fisheries suggested the use of gill nets with mesh size greater than 88. 9 mm {{in order to avoid the}} capture of immature Ti/apia spp. But if the fishermen are to obtain economic gains from the fishery, the optimum mesh size for use is 88. 9 - 101. 6 mm. (4) The gillnet is a <b>passive</b> <b>gear</b> with very beneficial selective characteristics. Unfortunately the drive-in fishery which exists on Lake Kitangiri more or less destroys the gillnet selectivity characteristics. It is therefore recommended that the beating of water with poles be discouraged and stopped. (5) There is need for provision of stable fishing canoes to replace the unstable bottle palm dug-out canoes which are currently being used and which are very risky to operate. (6) The fish processing facilities on Lake Kitangiri are still inadequate. Most of the fish is sun dried, Since sun drying is very difficult during the rainy season, most fishermen carry out intensive fishing during the dry season, Concentrating most of the fishing effort in anyone season instead of spreading evenly this effort over the whole year could damage the age structure of the exploitable stocks. (7) There are considerable fluctuations in the volume of water of the lake. The feasibility of regulating the water loss through the effluent Sibiti river should be investigated by the Water Development Department. (8) Damming the Sibiti river is an expensive undertaking and therefore, the Rural Development Bank of Tanzania should be asked to assess the economic feasibility of such a project...|$|E
40|$|The NASA roadmap {{outlining}} future {{deep space}} missions to Europa and other outer planetary destinations calls for continued {{reductions in the}} mass and volume of the spacecraft avionics. Spacecraft power electronics, including the power switches and converters, remain difficult to miniaturize due {{to the need for}} large numbers of discrete passive components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors and transformers. As part of the System-on-a-chip program at the Center for Integrated Space Microsystems and at the University of Arkansas, we are working to develop integrated or embedded <b>passive</b> components <b>geared</b> specifically for use in power management and distribution (PMAD) in future avionics over the next five to ten years. This will not only enable a scaling down of the power subsystems, but will make possible new architectures such as "distributed" PMAD.

40|$|Abstract. When {{designing}} a landing gear damper, it is well-known that damper characteristics required for good handling {{are not the}} same as those required for good ride comfort. Semi-active control landing gear damper, as their name implies, fill the gap between purely passive damper and fully active control Langing gear-control systems and offer the reliability of passive systems, yet maintain the versatility and adaptability of fully active devices. During recent years there has been considerable interest towards theoretical study and practical practical implementation of this semi-active control landing gear damper for their low energy requirement and cost. For this reason, The basic theoretical for semi-active landing gear damper design and implementation has been briefly reviewed, mathematical model of semi-active control landing gear is established. A state feedback semi-active controller is designed. At last, the <b>passive</b> control landing <b>gear</b> model and semi-active control landing gear model are simulated. Simulation result shows that the vibration of <b>passive</b> control landing <b>gear</b> is vehement, and the system stable time is long. But in the simi-active control landing gear system the impact load and vibraton can be reduced, the aircraft can reach the stability state in a few seconds. Using linear quadratic optimal control effect is good. Intorductio...|$|R

Tests included landing impact and traversal of simulated runway roughness. It is shown that the active gear is feasible and very effective in reducing the force transmitted to the airframe. Preliminary validation of a multidegree of freedom active gear flexible airframe takeoff and landing analysis computer program, which {{may be used as}} a design tool for active gear systems, is accomplished by comparing experimental and computed data for the <b>passive</b> and active <b>gears...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractSemi-active {{landing gear}} can provide good {{performance}} of both landing impact and taxi situation, {{and has the}} ability for adapting to various ground conditions and operational conditions. A kind of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control algorithm (NMPC) for semi-active landing gears is developed in this paper. The NMPC algorithm uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) as the optimization technique and chooses damping performance of landing gear at touch down to be the optimization object. The valve's rate and magnitude limitations are also considered in the controller's design. A simulation model is built for the semi-active landing gear's damping process at touchdown. Drop tests are carried out on an experimental <b>passive</b> landing <b>gear</b> systerm to validate {{the parameters of the}} simulation model. The result of numerical simulation shows that the isolation of impact load at touchdown can be significantly improved compared to other control algorithms. The strongly nonlinear dynamics of semi-active landing gear coupled with control valve's rate and magnitude limitations are handled well with the proposed controller...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{aircraft}} applications, {{ensuring the}} power {{quality of the}} electrical system {{is one of the}} critical constraints during network equipment design. This task must be done in accordance with additional constraints like the global weight, cost and volume. In order to prevent high level disturbances in aircraft networks, international standards have fixed the conducted EMI levels that power converters are allowed to emit. On the other hand, respecting these standards at the design step requires analytical and semi-analytical models that are able to achieve a real system analysis and to develop optimized equipments adapted to the network requirements. In this paper we paved the way towards an anticipatory estimation of low frequency harmonics in a typical electrical actuator topology (Filter+Converter+Motor+Reductor). Several models (Three-phase PMW inverter, <b>passive</b> filter, <b>gear</b> reducers and a permanent magnet synchronous machine) were implemented in CADES software in order to find an optimal harmonics/weight Pareto solution using a deterministic or hybrid optimization approach allowing fast optimizations with a high number of parameters and constraints...|$|R
