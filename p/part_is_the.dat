5|$|Geologically the East Riding {{district}} is split into three parts. The western <b>part</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> eastern {{section of the}} Vale of York with the southern extension into the Humberhead Levels. In this area there is a belt of sandstones overlain by glacial and lake deposits formed {{at the close of}} the last ice age. The middle <b>part</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Yorkshire Wolds, a chalk formation which extends from the Humber at North Ferriby to the coast at Flamborough Head, a chalk headland. The south-east of the {{district is}} the low-lying coastal plain of Holderness, which faces east to the North Sea, and to the south drains into the Humber estuary. South of Flamborough Head is Bridlington, which features several beaches, and at the far south-east of the district is the Spurn peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Fish have a {{closed-loop}} circulatory system. The heart pumps {{the blood}} in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit. The first <b>part</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part, the atrium, which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, ventricle. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta, through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} two distinctive {{modes of}} play - a single player campaign and multiplayer matches. In both modes, players {{are put into}} a first-person perspective from within the cockpit of a starfighter and have full control over their craft, but the only visible <b>part</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> interface - the head-up display (HUD) - which can be customised with different colours and by what information is displayed. Outside of these modes, the main menu {{of the game is}} designed around the interior of a ship's quarterdeck, with various elements (mostly doors) leading to different options, such as starting a new game, configuring the game, reviewing the crafts featured in the game and various story elements, and replaying completed single player missions.|$|E

The gondolas also spin freely on a circular rotation just like the arms that hold the gondolas. <b>The</b> fourth <b>parts</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> fountains.

5|$|The oldest {{residence}} in Cluj-Napoca is the Matthias Corvinus House, originally a Gothic structure that bears Transylvanian Renaissance characteristics {{due to a}} later renovation. Such changes feature on other Hungarian townspeople's residences, built from the mid-15th century mostly of stone and wood with a cellar, ground floor and upper storey, in the Late Gothic and Renaissance styles; although the late medieval houses have often been considerably altered, the street façades of the old town are mostly preserved. St. Michael's Church, {{the oldest and most}} representative Gothic-style building in the country, dates back to the 14th century. The oldest of its sections is the altar, dedicated in 1390, while the newest <b>part</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> clock tower, which was built in Gothic Revival style (1860).|$|E
5|$|A termite nest can be {{considered}} as being composed of two parts, the inanimate and the animate. The animate is all of the termites living inside the colony, and the inanimate <b>part</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> structure itself, which is constructed by the termites. Nests can be broadly separated into three main categories: subterranean (completely below ground), epigeal (protruding above the soil surface), and arboreal (built above ground, but always connected to the ground via shelter tubes). Epigeal nests (mounds) protrude from the earth with ground contact and are made out of earth and mud. A nest has many functions such as providing a protected living space and providing shelter against predators. Most termites construct underground colonies rather than multifunctional nests and mounds. Primitive termites of today nest in wooden structures such as logs, stumps and the dead parts of trees, as did termites millions of years ago.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{contains}} {{a total of}} 58 Grade II listed buildings, including a Grade II* listed barn, and the Church of the Holy Cross, a Grade I listed building. The church dates from the late 12th century with early 13th and 15th century additions, {{as well as a}} substantial restoration in 1863. The building itself consists of stone walls, a tiled roof, and a stone slated porch. The oldest <b>part</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> chancel, which dates from the 12th century with 15th century extensions. The north chapel was altered in 1331, and in its churchyard is the grave of famed Second World War Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery (Viscount Montgomery of Alamein). Other listed buildings include Barnfield House – three houses which were once separated all dating from 1550 with 20th century restorations. The house itself has a timber frame with a tiled roof, including a late medieval hall. Mill Court, another Grade II listed building, is a large house dating from the early 19th century with a low pitched roof and yellow brickwork, and became a listed building on 15 August 1985.|$|E

5|$|Unlike other Academy Awards, the Best Foreign Language Film Award is not {{presented}} {{to a specific}} individual. It is accepted by the winning film's director, but is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole. Over the years, the Best Foreign Language Film Award and its predecessors have been given almost exclusively to European films: out of the 68 awards handed out by the Academy since 1947 to foreign language films, 56 have gone to European films, six to Asian films, three to African films and three to films from the Americas. The late Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini directed four Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award-winning motion pictures during his lifetime, {{more than any other}} director. If Special Awards are taken into account, then Fellini's record is tied by his fellow countryman Vittorio De Sica. The Soviet epic War and Peace (1966–67), for its <b>part,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> longest motion picture to have won the Best Foreign Language Film Award. Filmed from 1962 to 1966, it ran for more than seven hours.|$|E
