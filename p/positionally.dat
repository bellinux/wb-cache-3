25|$|Trenches seem <b>positionally</b> stable over time, but {{scientists}} believe that some trenches—particularly those associated with subduction zones where two oceanic plates converge—move backward into the subducting plate.

25|$|Korchnoi was {{comfortable}} playing {{with or without}} the initiative. He could attack, counterattack, play <b>positionally,</b> and was a master of the endgame. He became known as the master of counterattack, and he was the most difficult opponent of Mikhail Tal, an out-and-out attacker. He had a large lifetime plus score against Tal (+13−4=27), and also had plus scores against world champions Petrosian and Spassky. He had equal records against Botvinnik (+1−1=2) and Fischer (+2−2=4). He defeated nine undisputed world champions from Botvinnik through to Garry Kasparov, and Magnus Carlsen.|$|E
25|$|Most jurisdictions permit rear {{fog lamps}} to be {{installed}} either singly or in pairs. If a single rear fog is fitted, most jurisdictions require it to be located at or to the driver's side of the vehicle's centreline—whichever side is the prevailing driver's side {{in the country in}} which the vehicle is registered. This is to maximize the sight line of following drivers to the rear fog lamp. In many cases, a single reversing lamp is mounted on the passenger side of the vehicle, <b>positionally</b> symmetrical with the rear fog. If two {{rear fog lamps}} are fitted, they must be symmetrical with respect to the vehicle's centreline.|$|E
25|$|Staal is an {{excellent}} skater, adept shot blocker and regular penalty killer with the Rangers. Offensively, he is a smart passer who makes the intelligent plays to his teammates and generally plays <b>positionally.</b> Due to his skating ability, he periodically joins the offensive rush despite being a defenceman. He has a very accurate wrist shot and a hard slapshot that has improved in accuracy since his NHL debut. His improving offence led him to see more ice time on the power play beginning in the 2010–11 season, where he can apply those offensive skills more directly in the scoring effort. Upon entering the NHL, the Rangers coaching staff have primarily used him in a defensive role. However his point totals improved steadily his first few years in the NHL, and each year from 2007–08 to 2009–10, he established new career highs in goals, assists and points.|$|E

Harry Haddon, a soldier stationed at Lichfield, set up a goal for Mobley, but by then the home side were 3–0 up against a struggling defence. Small Heath put out a strong side against Blackburn Rovers– the Leicester Chronicle believed that [...] "at no period of the season have they had such a representative team". While Corinthian back Lewis Vaughan Lodge's long-expected first appearance for the club– which proved to be his last– was marred {{by a lack of}} discipline <b>positionally,</b> Haddon enhanced his reputation at centre-forward and contributed to Wheldon's fine winning goal after debutant Bill Robertson had scored from a penalty kick.

2500|$|Critics have doubted {{both the}} {{feasibility}} of self-replicating nanorobots and {{the feasibility of}} control if self-replicating nanorobots could be achieved: they cite the possibility of mutations removing any control and favoring reproduction of mutant pathogenic variations. [...] Advocates address the first doubt {{by pointing out that}} the first macroscale autonomous machine replicator, made of Lego blocks, was built and operated experimentally in 2002. [...] While there are sensory advantages present at the macroscale compared to the limited sensorium available at the nanoscale, proposals for <b>positionally</b> controlled nanoscale mechanosynthetic fabrication systems employ dead reckoning of tooltips combined with reliable reaction sequence design to ensure reliable results, hence a limited sensorium is no handicap; [...] similar considerations apply to the positional assembly of small nanoparts. [...] Advocates address the second doubt by arguing that bacteria are (of necessity) evolved to evolve, while nanorobot mutation could be actively prevented by common error-correcting techniques. Similar ideas are advocated in the Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology, and a map of the 137-dimensional replicator design space recently published by Freitas and Merkle provides numerous proposed methods by which replicators could, in principle, be safely controlled by good design.|$|E
