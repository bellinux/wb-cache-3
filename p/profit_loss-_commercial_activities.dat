Starting from {{the observation that}} donations to individual non-profits are often highly volatile, we show how investment in <b>commercial</b> <b>activity</b> can constitute a form of insurance for mission activity. Although investment in <b>commercial</b> <b>activity</b> has an opportunity cost in terms of capacity to produce mission output, if donations {{turn out to be}} low the commercial revenue will enable cross-subsidization of mission output.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we use tereke records of Manisa and Kayseri, and compare wealth {{distributions}} between 1700 - 1720 and 1780 - 1800 periods. We first checked whether rise in wealth of non-Muslims was {{more significant than}} of Muslims in both cities. We found that in Manisa, as is expected because it had strong commercial relationship with Europe, non-Muslims economically improved more than Muslims. However, a rapid economic decline of non-Muslims is observed in Kayseri. Then we tried to examine <b>commercial</b> <b>activities</b> of Muslims and non-Muslims through commercial properties in the tereke records. We observed that <b>commercial</b> <b>activities</b> of non-Muslims also expanded in comparison with <b>commercial</b> <b>activities</b> of Muslims in Manisa, and <b>commercial</b> <b>activities</b> of non-Muslims reduced in Kayseri. Therefore we rejected the claim {{that there was a}} general ascendance of non-Muslims in the 18 th century. Non- Muslims seem to develop only in regions which had strong commercial relationship with Europe, but in regions like Kayseri, where domestic trade was strong, both general wealth level and vitality of <b>commercial</b> <b>activities</b> of non-Muslims left behind Muslims...|$|R
