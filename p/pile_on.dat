5|$|Luton {{came close}} to scoring their second goal of the match when Harford got away from Caesar and ran towards the left byline. His cross into the penalty area was met by Brian Stein's head, but Lukic made a crucial save, tipping the ball wide. Both {{managers}} brought on substitutes after the hour mark – Mark Stein came on for Harford, while Martin Hayes replaced Groves. The latter substitution worked to Arsenal's advantage, as it brought about their equaliser in the 72nd minute. Davis' free kick delivered in was only half cleared by Foster and amongst the scramble, Hayes drove {{the ball in the}} net. Arsenal continued to <b>pile</b> <b>on</b> pressure, and took the lead three minutes later, when Smith received a pass from Thomas to score.|$|E

Some ground-dwelling species have dispensed with this, either depositing their eggs in an underground chamber or pushing them into {{the wall of a}} burrow. The short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus) excavates a burrow with chambers and a defecating area, lays its eggs in a <b>pile</b> <b>on</b> a chamber floor, and after the eggs have hatched, feeds the juveniles for about a month.|$|E

25|$|Stratovolcanoes or {{composite}} volcanoes are tall conical mountains {{composed of}} lava flows and other ejecta in alternate layers, the strata that {{gives rise to}} the name. Stratovolcanoes are also known as composite volcanoes because they are created from multiple structures during different kinds of eruptions. Strato/composite volcanoes are made of cinders, ash, and lava. Cinders and ash <b>pile</b> <b>on</b> top of each other, lava flows on top of the ash, where it cools and hardens, and then the process repeats.

However, once again, the all-rounders fought back. Australian Shane Watson made 82, while Pothas added 74, and number 11 Chris Tremlett made an unbeaten 44 to ensure that Hampshire set a competitive target of 271, despite Kirtley's five for 67. Ian Ward made 60 and Murray Goodwin an unbeaten 51 as Sussex cruised to 167 for 3 after only 38 overs on day three, needing 104 more to win on the fourth day.|$|E

Taufeeq was dismissed the next morning, leg before wicket to Mahmudullah; Hafeez went on to score his fourth Test century, eventually falling for 143 runs. Pakistan continued to <b>pile</b> <b>on</b> the runs with another large partnership, a fifth-wicket stand of 259 runs between Younus Khan and Asad Shafiq over the Test's second and third days. Shafiq scored his first Test century before being dismissed for 104; Younus scored his third Test double century.

25|$|Rogers was retired hurt for 49 early {{during the}} morning session of the fourth day {{but that did not}} halt the Australian onslaught. Australia batsmen {{continued}} to <b>pile</b> <b>on</b> quick runs as they attacked the England bowlers, increasing the lead. Warner was dismissed for 83, before an aggressive 48-ball 58 from Smith and quickfire cameos from Clarke and Mitchell Marsh had taken the visitors' total to 254/2 in just 49 overs when Clarke decided to declare. Being set an improbable target of 509 runs to be scored in five sessions, England started poorly with none of the top-order batsmen reaching 15. England were eventually bowled out in just 37 overs for 103. Australia thus leveled the series 1–1 with a 405-run victory and Smith was named player of the match.|$|E
25|$|Each team {{consisted}} of 40 to 50 men. The best players were highly prized, and villages gave them houses, planted their fields for them, and overlooked their misdeeds {{in an effort}} to keep such players on their teams. Players scored one point if they hit the goalpost with the ball, and two points if the ball landed in the nest. Eleven points won the game. Play was rough: players would <b>pile</b> <b>on</b> fallen players, walk on them, kick them, including in the face, pull on arms and legs and stuff dirt in each other's mouths. Players were told to die before letting go of the ball. They would try to hide the ball in their mouths; other players would choke them or kick them in the stomach to force the ball out. Arms and legs were broken. Players laid out on the ground would be revived by a bucket of cold water. There were occasional deaths. According to Father Paiva, five games in a row had ended in riots.|$|E
25|$|On March 3, 1995, Hug {{entered the}} 1995 Grand Prix at {{the round of}} sixteen {{qualifier}} where his rivalry with Mike Bernardo began. Both fighters traded heavy shots with Bernardo seemingly getting the better until Hug dropped him with a high kick {{towards the end of}} the first round. The South African boxer continued to <b>pile</b> <b>on</b> the pressure, however, and in the third, knocked Hug down with a left hook shortly followed by a standing eight count. Finally, he forced Hug into a corner and delivered a relentless beating on the Swiss karateka until referee Nobuaki Kakuda finally stopped the bout after a prolonged barrage of unanswered punches. Hug had a quick turnaround, as he was back in the ring on May 4, 1995, scoring a forty-five second knockout over Peter Kramer in a K-1 World Grand Prix 1995 non-tournament affair. On June 10, 1995, Hug made the first defence of his UKF title against Dennis Lane at K-1 Fight Night in Zurich, the first K-1 event held in Switzerland. In a rather one-sided fight, Andy Hug knocked Lane down twice in the first two rounds before the American quit on his stool.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} {{synchronize}} the samples, The Bomb Squad used SMPTE timecodes and arranged and overdubbed particular bits of backing tracks, {{which had been}} inspected by the members for snare, bass, and hi-hat sounds. Chuck D said of their production and sampling, [...] "Our music is all about samples in the right area, layers that <b>pile</b> <b>on</b> each other. We put loops on top of loops on top of loops, but then in the mix we cut things away". Their production was innovative, according to journalist Jeff Chang. [...] "They're {{figuring out how to}} jam with the samples and to create these layers of sound", Chang said. [...] "I don't think it’s been matched since then." [...] After the tracks were completed, The Bomb Squad began sequencing what was at first a seemingly discontinuous album, amid internal disputes among its members. The final mixing took place at Greene St. Recording and lasted until February 1990. According to Sadler, [...] "a lot of people were like, 'Wow, it's a brilliant album'.

500|$|Hines {{discovered}} {{a way to}} escape from the Ohio Penitentiary. He had been reading the novel Les Misérables and was said to be inspired by Jean Valjean and Valjean's escapes through the passages underneath Paris, France. Hines noticed how dry the lower prison cells felt and how they were lacking in mold, even though sunlight never shined there. This caused him to believe that escape by tunneling down was possible. [...] After discovering an air chamber underneath them, which he had deduced, Hines begun the tunneling effort. The tunnel was only eighteen inches wide, which was just large enough for him to enter the four foot by four foot air chamber that was surrounded by heavy masonry. As Hines and the six others who accompanied Hines and John Hunt Morgan worked on the tunnel, a thin crust of dirt was used to hide the tunneling from the prison officials. They tunneled for six weeks, with the tunnel's exit coming between the inner and the [...] outer prison walls, near a coal <b>pile.</b> <b>On</b> the day of escape, November 26, 1863, Morgan switched cells with his brother, Colonel Richard Morgan. The day was chosen as a new Union military commander was coming to Columbus, and Morgan knew that the prison cells would be inspected at that time. Together, after the daily midnight inspection, Hines, John Hunt Morgan and five captains under Morgan's command used the tunnel to escape. Aided {{by the fact that the}} prison sentries sought shelter from the raging storm occurring at the time, the Confederate officers climbed the [...] wall effortlessly, using metal hooks to effect their escape.|$|E

PopCultureShock also praised the background art, which [...] "bring the streets of Hiroshima to vivid life". Manga News described the apparently simplistic art as beautiful, which emphasizes the story's depth without ever going over-the-top or into excess morality.
