Objective and an non-objective measures must be associated to fit within a strategic framework (Drucker, 1990; Mcnair and Mosconi, 1987). The empirical literature reports a high diversity of performance indicators (Combs, Crook & Shook, 2005) and the common distinctions are objective and subjective measures.|$|R

Results from regression analysis indicates that the CEO pay-performance relation is substantially lower when firm <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> adjusted for the effect of earnings management than when firm <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> measured as reported <b>performance.</b> That <b>is,</b> {{the positive effect of}} executive compensation on firm performance disappears when firm <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> measured as adjusted firm performance excluding earnings management in Chinese listed firms, and as a result, we can identify that the evident executive pay-performance relation is largely cosmetic. We also find that the proportion of independent directors on board is significantly positively associated with firm performance only when the firm <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> adjusted for the effect of earnings management. Similar results are found in ownership concentration too. These results suggest that independent directors are shown as more effective governance mechanism in Chinese listed firms when true firm <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> considered while the positive effect of CEO compensation disappears concerning true firm performance...|$|R
