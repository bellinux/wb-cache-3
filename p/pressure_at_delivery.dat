40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objectives}} were {{to assess the}} quality of health management information system (HMIS) data needed for assessment of local area variation in pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) incidence and to describe district and regional variations in PIH incidence. METHODS: A retrospective review of antenatal and delivery records of 2, 682 pregnant women in ten district hospitals in the Greater Accra and Upper West regions of Ghana was conducted in 2013. Quality of HMIS data was assessed by completeness of reporting. The incidence of PIH was estimated for each district. RESULTS: Key variables for routine assessment of PIH such as blood pressure at antenatal visits, weight and height were 95 % to 100 % complete. Fundal height, gestational age and blood <b>pressure</b> <b>at</b> <b>delivery</b> were not consistently reported. The incidence of PIH differed significantly between Greater Accra region (6. 1 %) and Upper West region (3. 2 %). Prevalence of obesity among pregnant women in Greater Accra region (13. 9 %) {{was significantly higher than}} that of women in Upper West region (2. 2 %). CONCLUSIONS: More attention needs to be given to understanding local area variations in PIH and possible relationships with urbanization and lifestyle changes that promote obesity, to inform maternal and newborn health policy. This can be done with good quality routine HMIS data. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. This study {{reviewed}} {{the course of}} pregnancies in terms of impact on renal function and delivery-related data among women who received kidney transplants in our unit. Methods. We {{reviewed the}} medical records of women transplanted between 1982 and 2002 who became pregnant. We recorded the data of medical, obstetrical, and transplant-related complications, plasma creatinine levels, and blood <b>pressures</b> <b>at</b> baseline, <b>delivery,</b> and 12 months after delivery. Results. Thirty women had 37 pregnancies. Immunosuppressive protocols included cyclosporine, ketoconazole, azathioprine, and prednisone in 22 patients or azathioprine and prednisone in 15. Renal function decreased significantly: mean creatinine levels <b>at</b> baseline, <b>delivery,</b> and after 1 year were: 1. 19 &PLUSMN; 0. 38 mg/dL; 1. 44 &PLUSMN; 0. 70 mg/dL; and 1. 38 &PLUSMN; 0. 53 mg/dL, respectively (P =. 023 and P =. 004 vs baseline respectively). Systolic and diastolic blood <b>pressures</b> <b>at</b> <b>delivery</b> were higher than at baseline (134 &PLUSMN; 19 and 86 &PLUSMN; 14 mm Hg vs 126 &PLUSMN; 21 and 79 &PLUSMN; 13 mm Hg (P =. 029 and P =. 053, respectively). These values normalized 1 year later (128 &PLUSMN; 21 and 80 &PLUSMN; 16). Decreased use of antihypertensive drugs were the cause of poor blood pressure control (1. 8 &PLUSMN; 1. 3 vs 0. 9 &PLUSMN; 0. 7, P <. 01). Blood pressure control improved following delivery. The most frequent complications were preeclampsia (18, 9 %), intrahepatic cholestasis (13. 5 %), and urinary tract infections (13. 5 %). There were five rejection episodes. Seven miscarriages took place and one mole. Eleven pregnancies were uncomplicated. Conclusion. Renal transplantation is the best treatment for fertile women with end-stage renal disease who want to become pregnant. However, pregnancy is risky for the mother, fetus, newborn, and allograft...|$|R
