5|$|Słowacki {{was not a}} {{very popular}} figure in Paris, nor among his contemporaries. He wrote many dramas, which can be seen as his {{favorite}} genre, yet he was a playwright who never saw any of his work performed on stage (only Mazepa was staged during his lifetime, and not in his presence). His works, written in Polish, dense with Slavic myths, philosophy and symbols, were difficult to translate to other languages. Słowacki's unpopularity among other Polish émigrés can be attributed to his unwillingness to <b>pander</b> to contemporary tastes; and in particular, his refusal to comfort his compatriots, shaken by the loss of Polish statehood and the failure of the November Uprising. Słowacki's ironic and sometimes pessimistic attitude was not appreciated by his contemporaries, nor was his denial of Polish uniqueness.|$|E

50|$|United States v. Panfil, 338 F.3d 1299, 1300 (11th Cir. 2003).“Pandering” {{is defined}} as the {{catering}} to or exploitation of the weaknesses of others, especially “to provide gratification for others’ desires.” As a legal concept, <b>pandering</b> is most commonly associated with prostitution. In that context, <b>pandering</b> provisions are statutes penalizing various acts by intermediaries who engage in the commercial exploitation of prostitution and are aimed at those who, as agents, promote prostitution rather than against the prostitutes themselves. The term <b>pandering,</b> in some instances, is applied by Congress and the courts to the promotion of obscenity. See, e.g., 39 U.S.C. § 3008 (prohibiting <b>pandering</b> advertisements of sexually provocative materials by mail), Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463, 86 S. Ct. 942, 16 L.Ed.2d 31 (1966) (considering obscene nature of erotically advertised publications). Congress has characterized both the child pornography regulation at issue in this case (18 U.S.C. 2252A(a)(3)(B)) and its unconstitutional predecessor (18 U.S.C. § 2256(8)(D) (1996)) as “pandering” provisions. imprisonment for the <b>pandering</b> charge and sixtymonths for the possession charge, to be served concurrently.|$|R

25|$|Designed by Theo Slot, who was {{responsible}} for all of <b>Pander</b> & Sons original designs, the Multipro is variously described as a side-by-side two-seat or three-seat light aircraft.

The fuselage was a rounded, plywood-skinned structure, contemporaries remarking, as they had with other Panders, {{on the quality of the}} finish.|$|E

25|$|Attempts {{have been}} made in the U.S. to charge pornographic-film {{producers}} with <b>pandering</b> under state law. The case of California v. Freeman in 1989 is one of the most prominent examples where a producer/director of pornographic films was charged with <b>pandering</b> under the argument that paying porn actors to perform sex on camera was a form of prostitution covered by a state anti-pandering statute. The State Supreme Court rejected this argument, finding that the California <b>pandering</b> statute was not intended to cover the hiring of actors who would be engaging in sexually-explicit but non-obscene performances. It also stated that only in cases where the producer paid the actors for the purpose of sexually gratifying themselves or other actors, could the producer be charged with <b>pandering</b> under state law. This case effectively legalized pornography in the State of California. In 2008, the New Hampshire Supreme Court would issue a similar ruling (New Hampshire v. Theriault) which declared that producing pornography was not a form of prostitution under state law.|$|R

25|$|Socrates {{responds}} to the death-penalty verdict by first addressing the jurors who voted for his death. He says that their condemnation of him resulted not {{from a lack of}} arguments, but from a lack of time — and an unwillingness to <b>pander</b> for pity, as expected of a man condemned to death. Socrates repeats that the prospect of death does not absolve him from following the path of goodness and truth. He prophesies that younger and harsher critics shall follow in his stead, philosophers who will spur ethical conduct from the citizens of Athens, in a manner more vexing than that of Socrates (39d).|$|E
