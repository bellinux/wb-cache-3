5|$|Teller {{was one of}} {{the strongest}} and best-known advocates for {{investigating}} non-military uses of nuclear explosives, which the United States explored under Operation <b>Plowshare.</b> One of the most controversial projects he proposed was a plan to use a multi-megaton hydrogen bomb to dig a deep-water harbor more than a mile long and half a mile wide to use for shipment of resources from coal and oil fields through Point Hope, Alaska. The Atomic Energy Commission accepted Teller's proposal in 1958 and it was designated Project Chariot. While the AEC was scouting out the Alaskan site, and having withdrawn the land from the public domain, Teller publicly advocated the economic benefits of the plan, but was unable to convince local government leaders that the plan was financially viable.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{moldboard}} iron plow: Although use of {{the simple}} wooden ard in China must have preceded it, the earliest discovered Chinese iron plows date to roughly 500 BC, during the Zhou Dynasty (1122–256 BC) and were flat, V-shaped, and mounted on wooden poles and handles. By the 3rd century BC, improved iron casting techniques {{led to the development}} of the heavy moldboard plow, seen in Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) artwork such as tomb carved bricks. The moldboard allowed the Chinese to turn farm soil without clogging the <b>plowshare</b> with dirt, which was flung off the wheelbarrow via slanted wings on both sides. While the frame of excavated plowshares dating to the Warring States period (403–221 BC) were made mostly of perishable wood except for the iron blade, the frame of excavated plowshares dating to the Han Dynasty were made entirely of solid iron with the moldboard attached to the top to turn the soil.|$|E
5|$|The thicker {{end of the}} log, the {{end that}} was nearest to the tree's roots, may have a special significance. In Montenegro {{it is called the}} head of the badnjak; the main log is laid on the fire with its head {{pointing}} east. In central Serbia the badnjak is laid with its thicker end sticking out from the ognjište. The household's shepherds would kiss over it to ensure an abundance of lambs in the coming year. In Gruža it is coated with honey which is then licked by children. At the side of ognjište where the thicker end is situated, the family may place a <b>plowshare,</b> a round loaf of bread, a glove filled with wheat, sugar, or a sieve containing grain, honey, cakes, wine, salt, prunes, walnuts, and apples. The cut surface of the thicker end is in Čečava kissed by all the family members after the badnjak is laid on the fire.|$|E

25|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} agricultural innovations {{such as the}} iron <b>plowshare,</b> {{as well as the}} growing use of metal as a building material, was also a driving force in the tremendous growth of the iron industry during this period. Inventions like the arrastra were often used by the Spanish to pulverize ore after being mined. This device was powered by animals and used the same principles used for grain threshing.|$|E
25|$|Storax Sedan was {{a shallow}} {{underground}} nuclear test conducted in Area 10 of Yucca Flat at the Nevada National Security Site on July 6, 1962 {{as part of}} Operation <b>Plowshare,</b> a program to investigate {{the use of nuclear}} weapons for mining, cratering, and other civilian purposes. The radioactive fallout from the test contaminated more US residents than any other nuclear test. The Sedan Crater is the largest man-made crater in the United States, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Plowshare</b> project {{developed}} the Sedan test {{in order to}} determine the feasibility of using nuclear detonations to quickly and economically excavate large amounts of earth and rock. Proposed applications included the creation of harbors, canals, open pit mines, railroad and highway cuts through mountainous terrain and the construction of dams. Assessment of the full effects of the Sedan shot showed that the radioactive fallout from such uses would be extensive. Public concerns about the health effects and a lack of political support eventually led to abandonment of the concept. No such nuclear excavation has since been undertaken by the United States, though the Soviet Union continued to pursue the concept through their program Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy, particularly with their 140 kiloton Chagan (nuclear test), which created an artificial lake reservoir (see Lake Chagan).|$|E

25|$|Whilst {{elements}} with atomic numbers {{expected for}} the island of stability have been produced, the total nucleon count of these nuclides has been too low. These synthesised nuclides have contained too few neutrons to reach the supposed stable region. It is possible that these elements possess unusual chemical properties and, if they have isotopes with adequate lifespans, would be available for various practical applications (such as particle accelerator targets and as neutron sources as well). In particular, the very small critical masses of transplutonic elements (possibly as small as grams) implies that if stable elements could be found, they would enable small and compact nuclear bombs either directly or by serving as primaries to help ignite fission/fusion secondaries; this possibility motivated much of the early research in the 1960s and multiple nuclear tests by the United States (including Operation <b>Plowshare)</b> and the Soviet Union aimed at producing such elements.|$|E
25|$|Project <b>Plowshare</b> “was named {{directly}} from the Bible itself, specifically Micah 4:3, which states that God will beat swords into ploughshares, and spears into pruning hooks, so that no country could lift up weapons against another”. Proposed uses included widening the Panama Canal, constructing a new sea-level waterway through Nicaragua nicknamed the Pan-Atomic Canal, cutting paths through mountainous areas for highways, and connecting inland river systems. Other proposals involved blasting underground caverns for water, natural gas, and petroleum storage. It was proposed to plant underground atomic bombs to extract shale oil in eastern Utah and western Colorado. Serious consideration was also given to using these explosives for various mining operations. One proposal suggested using nuclear blasts to connect underground aquifers in Arizona. Another plan involved surface blasting on the western slope of California's Sacramento Valley for a water transport project. However, there were many negative impacts from Project Plowshare’s 27 nuclear explosions. Consequences included blighted land, relocated communities, tritium-contaminated water, radioactivity, and fallout from debris being hurled high into the atmosphere. These were ignored and downplayed until the program was terminated in 1977, {{due in large part}} to public opposition, after $770 million had been spent on the project.|$|E
500|$|Donald B. Wagner {{writes that}} most {{domestic}} iron tools and implements produced during the Han {{were made of}} cheaper and more brittle cast iron, whereas the military preferred to use wrought iron and steel weaponry due to their more durable qualities. During the Han dynasty, the typical [...] bronze sword found in the Warring States period was gradually replaced with an iron sword measuring roughly [...] in length. The ancient dagger-axe (ge) made of bronze was still used by Han soldiers, although it was gradually phased out by iron spears and iron ji halberds. Even arrowheads, which were traditionally made of bronze, gradually only had a bronze tip and iron shaft, {{until the end of}} the Han when the entire arrowhead was made solely of iron. Farmers, carpenters, bamboo craftsmen, stonemasons, and rammed earth builders had at their disposal iron tools such as the <b>plowshare,</b> pickaxe, spade, shovel, hoe, sickle, axe, adze, hammer, chisel, knife, saw, scratch awl, and nails. Common iron commodities found in Han dynasty homes included tripods, stoves, cooking pots, belt buckles, tweezers, fire tongs, scissors, kitchen knives, fish hooks, and needles. Mirrors and oil lamps were often made of either bronze or iron. Coin money minted during the Han was made of either copper or copper and tin smelted together to make the bronze alloy.|$|E

40|$|The {{failure of}} the cutting {{elements}} of farm machinery {{is due to the}} blunting of cutting edges (increase of their radius) till the limit values. The most effective method for increasing the wear resistance of farm machinery is the realization of self-sharpening effect of the cutting elements.
