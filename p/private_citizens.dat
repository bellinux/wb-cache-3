5|$|Licinius and Martinianus {{surrendered}} to Constantine at Nicomedia {{on the promise}} their lives would be spared: they were sent to live as <b>private</b> <b>citizens</b> in Thessalonica and Cappadocia respectively, but in 325 Constantine accused Licinius of plotting against him and had them both arrested and hanged; Licinius's son (the son of Constantine's half-sister) was also killed.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} flag code of India did {{not allow}} <b>private</b> <b>citizens</b> to fly the national flag except on national days such as Independence Day or Republic Day. In 2001, Naveen Jindal, an industrialist used to the more egalitarian use of the flag in the United States where he studied, flew the Indian flag on his office building. The flag was confiscated and he was warned of prosecution. Jindal filed a public interest litigation petition in the High Court of Delhi; he sought to strike down the restriction {{on the use of}} the flag by <b>private</b> <b>citizens,</b> arguing that hoisting the national flag with due decorum and honour was his right as a citizen, and a way of expressing his love for the country.|$|E

5|$|Usage of {{the flag}} is governed by the Flag Code of India and other laws {{relating}} to the national emblems. The original code prohibited use {{of the flag}} by <b>private</b> <b>citizens</b> except on national days such as the Independence day and the Republic Day. In 2002, on hearing an appeal from a private citizen, Naveen Jindal, the Supreme Court of India directed the Government of India to amend the code to allow flag usage by <b>private</b> <b>citizens.</b> Subsequently, the Union Cabinet of India amended the code to allow limited usage. The code was amended once more in 2005 to allow some additional use including adaptations on certain forms of clothing. The flag code also governs the protocol of flying the flag and its use {{in conjunction with other}} national and non-national flags.|$|E

5|$|In the 3rd century, {{imperial}} mausolea {{began to}} be built as domed rotundas rather than tumulus structures or other types, following similar monuments by <b>private</b> <b>citizens.</b> Pagan and Christian domed mausolea from this time can be differentiated in that the structures of the buildings also reflect their religious functions. The pagan buildings are typically two story, dimly lit, free-standing structures with a lower crypt area for the remains and an upper area for devotional sacrifice. Christian domed mausolea contain a single well-lit space and are usually attached to a church.|$|E
5|$|London {{was also}} full of black powder, {{especially}} {{along the river}} front. Much of it {{was left in the}} homes of <b>private</b> <b>citizens</b> from the days of the English Civil War, as the former members of Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army still retained their muskets and the powder with which to load them. Five to six hundred tons of powder was stored in the Tower of London. The ship chandlers along the wharves also held large stocks, stored in wooden barrels.|$|E
5|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{gun control}} advocates have voiced {{concern over the}} {{perceived}} loophole in legislation, and campaigned to require background checks and record-keeping for all gun sales. Contrarily, gun rights advocates have stated {{that there is no}} loophole, that current laws provide a single, uniform set of rules for commercial gun sellers regardless of the place of sale, and that no part of the United States Constitution empowers the federal government to regulate non-commercial, intrastate transfers of legal firearms types between <b>private</b> <b>citizens.</b>|$|E

Prior to Canadian Confederation, the college was financially supported by the Presbyterian Church in Scotland, the Canadian government and <b>private</b> <b>citizens.</b> After Confederation, the college faced ruin {{when the federal government}} withdrew its funding and the Commercial Bank of the Midland District collapsed, a disaster which cost Queen's two-thirds of its endowment. The college was rescued after Principal William Snodgrass and other officials created a fundraising campaign across Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of private {{buildings on the}} boulevards and surrounding areas took place later. The middle class continued to prefer living in new suburbs rather than the cramped {{areas of the city}} center. The high prices of the land (expected to finance part of the construction costs) and the high rents were not within the means of the lower classes. Life in apartments was no longer desirable for residents of Brussels, who preferred to live in single family homes. The buildings constructed by <b>private</b> <b>citizens</b> had difficulty finding buyers.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the appeals}} process, the case was heard by the Supreme Court of India; the court ruled in Jindal's favour, asking the Government of India to {{consider}} the matter. The Union Cabinet of India then amended the Indian Flag Code with effect from 26 January 2002, allowing <b>private</b> <b>citizens</b> to hoist the flag on any day of the year, subject to their safeguarding the dignity, honour and respect of the flag. It is also held that the code was not a statute and restrictions under the code ought to be followed; also, the right to fly the flag is a qualified right, unlike the absolute rights guaranteed to citizens, and should be interpreted in the context of Article 19 of the Constitution of India.|$|E
5|$|By September 1954, the PBHistory {{agents had}} only {{managed to find}} {{a small number of}} top secret {{documents}}. Some of the documents gathered showed that government officials and communist party leaders had been able to dispose of most of the sensitive material before they left. In the period of uncertain leadership that followed Árbenz's overthrow and preceded Castillo Armas' taking power, a member of one of the ruling juntas had prevented the Comité from searching the homes of <b>private</b> <b>citizens,</b> and from arresting them, which potentially reduced the number of sensitive documents the CIA had access to. Additionally, Castillo Armas stated after taking power that the intelligence information of the army had been completely destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Slave labour was {{prevalent}} in mines and quarries, which had large slave populations, often leased out by rich <b>private</b> <b>citizens.</b> The strategos Nicias leased a thousand slaves to the silver mines of Laurium in Attica; Hipponicos, 600; and Philomidès, 300. Xenophon indicates {{that they received}} one obolus per slave per day, amounting to 60 drachmas per year. This {{was one of the}} most prized investments for Athenians. The number of slaves working in the Laurium mines or in the mills processing ore has been estimated at 30,000. Xenophon suggested that the city buy a large number of slaves, up to three state slaves per citizen, so that their leasing would assure the upkeep of all the citizens.|$|E
5|$|Stossel {{has criticized}} {{government}} programs for being inefficient, wasteful, and harmful. He has also criticized the American legal system, opining {{that it provides}} lawyers and vexatious litigators the incentive to file frivolous lawsuits indiscriminately. Stossel contends that these suits often generate more wealth for lawyers than for deserving clients, stifle innovation and personal freedoms, and cause harm to <b>private</b> <b>citizens,</b> taxpayers, consumers and businesses. Although Stossel concedes that some lawsuits are {{necessary in order to}} provide justice to people genuinely injured by others with greater economic power, he advocates the adoption in the U.S. of the English rule as one method to reduce the more abusive or frivolous lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|The Italian naval ensign {{comprises}} the national flag defaced with {{the arms of}} the Marina Militare; the Marina Mercantile (and <b>private</b> <b>citizens</b> at sea) use the civil ensign, differenced by the absence of the mural crown and the lion holding open the gospel, bearing the inscription PAX TIBI MARCE EVANGELISTA MEVS, instead of a sword. The shield is quartered, symbolic of the four great thalassocracies of Italy, the repubbliche marinare of Venice (represented by the lion passant, top left), Genoa (top right), Amalfi (bottom left), and Pisa (represented by their respective crosses); the rostrata crown was proposed by Admiral Cavagnari in 1939 to acknowledge the Navy's origins in ancient Rome.|$|E
