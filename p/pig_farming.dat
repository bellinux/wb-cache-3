The eco-efficiency degrees and trends were assessed by World Business Council for Sustainable Development recommendation and Snapshot graph plot, respectively. The results showed that the highest and lowest eco-efficiency degrees of Thai growing-fishing <b>pig</b> <b>farms</b> were drug and energy consumptions, respectively. The eco-efficiency of Thai growing-fishing <b>pig</b> <b>farms</b> snapshot showed that most eco-efficiency indicators were located in Fully-Eco-Efficiency.

40|$|Background: <b>Pig</b> <b>farm</b> {{environmental}} factors, such as temperature, humidity, light, {{harmful gas}} content like ammonia and carbon dioxide, {{as well as}} pigs’ daily behavioral data, such as sit and walk, feed intake, make up <b>pig</b> <b>farm</b> big data, which is important basis for accurate control of pigs’ health. The precise acquisition of such data becomes an urgent. Currently data collection in <b>pig</b> <b>farm</b> is of poor real-time performance and persistence, especially for video data in collaborative collection applications. Methods: Based on Internet of things technology, this paper builds up a <b>pig</b> <b>farm</b> big data acquisition system, designs a detailed IOT topology architecture, a network communication protocol and an intelligent processing gateway system, implements an integrated big data acquisition system for large-scale <b>pig</b> <b>farms.</b> Results: As a result, <b>pig</b> <b>farm</b> environmental factors, pigs’ feeding data and life monitoring video data, etc., can be comprehensively coordinated acquired. The experiment {{has been carried out}} in a <b>pig</b> <b>farm</b> in Guangdong province. One month consecutive experiment shows that our system can on-line monitor the farm environment information, pigs’ feeding and living conditions. It can catch the changes of <b>pig</b> <b>farm</b> environment and pigs’ growing status in time. Discussion: The relationship between environment and pigs’ activity can be explored through the experimental data. Conclusion: Our system has a broad application prospect. Farmers can take corresponding measures to cope with different scenarios according to the result of real-time monitoring. It is of great significance to the pig production industry...|$|R

25|$|A {{major factor}} {{contributing}} to the appearance of new zoonotic pathogens in human populations is increased contact between humans and wildlife. This can be caused either by encroachment of human activity into wilderness areas or by movement of wild animals into areas of human activity. An {{example of this is}} the outbreak of Nipah virus in peninsular Malaysia in 1999, when intensive <b>pig</b> <b>farming</b> began on the habitat of infected fruit bats. Unidentified infection of the pigs amplified the force of infection, eventually transmitting the virus to farmers and causing 105 human deaths.|$|E

Tattooing with a 'slap mark' {{on the shoulder}} or on the ear is the standard identification method in commercial <b>pig</b> <b>farming.</b> Branding is used for similar reasons and is often performed without anesthesia, but is different from tattooing as no ink or dye is inserted during the process, the mark instead being caused by permanent scarring of the skin. Pet dogs and cats are sometimes tattooed with a serial number (usually in the ear, or on the inner thigh) via which their owners can be identified.

25|$|In the 1930s and 40s, {{there was}} a second wave of migration. This new group, mostly landless peasants, is known as the Zabbaleen. The {{descendants}} of subsistence farmers, the Zabbaleen originate from the El Badari district in Asyut, a rural region in Upper Egypt, which is the southern part of Egypt. As farming ceased to be a viable way of life, the Zabbaleen faced economic hardships which prompted them to migrate to Cairo in search of work. Henceforth, the Wahiya collaborated with the Zabbaleen, who purchased waste from the Wahiya for use as fodder for <b>pig</b> <b>farming.</b> Initially, the Zabbaleen settled in the Imbaba district of the Giza governorate, but were given a four-day eviction notice from the governor of Giza in 1970. Thereafter, the Zabbaleen settled mainly in an abandoned quarry {{at the foot of the}} Mokattam hills, east of Cairo, which is under the jurisdiction of the Cairo Governorate. Although the governor of Cairo granted the Zabbaleen administrative permission to settle in the area, he did not issue a lease or legal tenure. Thus, because of their precarious situation, the Zabbaleen initially lived in makeshift settlements of tin huts, made mostly of barrels that the Zabbaleen found amongst the waste that they collected. This Zabbaleen community later emerged as the informal garbage collectors and recyclers of Cairo. The literal meaning of the word Zabbaleen is garbage-men (singular: Zabbal). The Zabbaleen are also known as Zarraba (singular: Zarrab), which means pig pen operators, because they raise pigs that eat the organic components of the waste that they collect.|$|E

40|$|Before {{setting up}} or {{changing}} a <b>pig</b> <b>farm</b> operation, {{the consequences of}} the farm set up must be explored and changes planned. To calculate technical and economic consequences a farm manager model for pig production systems, the <b>Pig</b> <b>Farm</b> Manager, has been developed. The <b>Pig</b> <b>Farm</b> Manager estimates the effects of various farm designs as well as farm management on production, environmental and economical parameters. The <b>Pig</b> <b>Farm</b> Manager includes simulations for sow <b>farms</b> and finisher <b>pig</b> <b>farms.</b> In the model the user enters farm data on e. g. farm size, housing system or farm management (e. g. feeding strategy), which the model uses to calculate output-parameters. The <b>Pig</b> <b>Farm</b> Manager estimates cost price, profits, gross margins, costs and income per farm, per sow or finisher place. To evaluate the analytical capacities of the model a comparison between a standard sow farm and a high-health-status farm was made. The high-health-farm (HHF) had better growth of piglets, lower mortality rate and better fertility traits for sows compared to a standard farm. However, the HHF had higher investment costs and required more labour. Overall, on the HHF, cost price per piglet was 3. 19 lower and yearly farm income about 21, 000,- higher compared to the standard sow farm. Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

In the south of the Netherlands, in recent years, the black rat (Rattus rattus) has emerged as a prominent rodent on livestock farms. From March till May 2008, a survey on MRSA in rats living on livestock farms in the south of The Netherlands and the north of Belgium was conducted. In total, 40 black rats (R. rattus) and 3 brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) were collected on 12 <b>farms</b> including five <b>pig</b> <b>farms,</b> five poultry <b>farms,</b> one mixed <b>pig</b> and veal <b>farm</b> and one goat farm.

2500|$|Transition of {{an indoor}} {{production}} system to an outdoor system may present obstacles. [...] Some breeds of pig {{commonly used in}} intensive farming have been selectively bred to suit intensive conditions.

[...] In certain environmental conditions – for example, a temperate climate – outdoor <b>pig</b> <b>farming</b> of these breeds is possible. However, {{there are many other}} breeds of pig suited to outdoor rearing, as they have been used in this way for centuries, such as Gloucester Old Spot and Oxford Forest. Following the UK ban of sow stalls, the British Pig Executive indicates that the <b>pig</b> <b>farming</b> industry in the UK has declined. The increase in production costs has led to British pig-products being more expensive than those from other countries, leading to increased imports and the need to position UK pork as a product deserving a price premium.|$|E
2500|$|Intensive piggeries {{have been}} {{increasingly}} criticized in preference of free range systems. Such systems usually refer {{not to a}} group-pen or shedding system, but to outdoor farming systems. Those that support outdoor systems usually do so {{on the grounds that}} they are more animal friendly and allow pigs to experience natural activities (e.g., wallowing in mud, relating to young, rooting soil). Outdoor systems are usually less economically productive due to increased space requirements and higher morbidity, (though, when dealing with the killing of piglets and other groups of swine, the methods are the same.) [...] They also have a range of environmental impacts, such as denitrification of soil and erosion. [...] Outdoor <b>pig</b> <b>farming</b> may also have welfare implications, for example, pigs kept outside may get sunburnt and are more susceptible to heat stress than in indoor systems, where air conditioning or similar can be used. [...] Outdoor <b>pig</b> <b>farming</b> may also increase the incidence of worms and parasites in pigs.
