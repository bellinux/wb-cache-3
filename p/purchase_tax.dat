25|$|The car proved {{popular in}} the UK market, where its three-wheel {{configuration}} meant that it qualified for a lower rate of <b>purchase</b> <b>tax,</b> lower vehicle excise duty and cheaper insurance than comparable four-wheel cars.

25|$|In April 1962 the <b>purchase</b> <b>tax</b> rate of 55 percent, {{which had}} been applied to all four-wheeled cars sold in the UK since the war was reduced to 45 per cent. In November 1962, it was reduced by another 20 per cent to 25 per cent – {{the same rate as}} that applied to three-wheelers. This rapid change meant that at the point of sale, some three-wheelers became more {{expensive}} than four-wheeled cars like the Mini. In response, Tom Gratrix, head of Sharp's sent a telegram to the Chancellor warning that unless a similar tax cut were given to the <b>purchase</b> <b>tax</b> rate for three-wheelers, there would be 300 redundancies and possibly the closure of the Sharp's factory. No cut was forthcoming, sales of Minicars declined rapidly from this point and the final Minicar was produced in 1966. At the end of production 24,482 had been made.|$|E
25|$|In October 1958, TVR's debt {{with the}} bank was nearing £10,000. At that point in the year, the factory had {{completed}} as few as ten cars, and orders from the United States had almost ceased {{due to the lack}} of sales success there. All of this was of little concern to TVR director and financier Fred Thomas, as he had apparently intended to close TVR and use the failure as a tax loss to benefit his own engineering firm. In actuality, the directors decided on 30 October that the company would be dissolved and re-formed as Layton Sports Cars Ltd. When the new company began trading in December 1958, the directors voted to immediately inject £15,000 to expand the workforce and build stocks of car components. In February 1959, a sister company was formed under the name Grantura Engineering Ltd. to avoid incurring the UK's <b>Purchase</b> <b>Tax</b> on sales of the cars (which were then still being offered as kits); <b>Purchase</b> <b>Tax</b> would not be applied to kit cars that were purchased from a different company than that which supplied the mechanical components.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{response}} of real wages and hours worked to an exogenous shock in fiscal policy. We identify this shock with the dynamic response of government <b>purchases</b> and <b>tax</b> rates to an exogenous increase in military purchases.

We assess the ability of standard Real Business Cycle models to account for these facts. They can [...] but only {{under the assumption that}} marginal income tax rates are constant, a standard assumption in the literature. Once we abandon this counterfactual assumption, RBC models cannot account for the facts. We argue that our empirical findings pose a challenge to a wide class of business cycle models. ...|$|R

Several prototypes were built in 1963, one of which is still known to exist in Pinner just outside London, England. The Moke was launched onto the British market in 1964. The British Customs and Excise department decided that the Moke should be classified as a passenger car rather than as a commercial vehicle, which meant that it attracted <b>purchase</b> <b>tax,</b> reducing sales in its intended commercial market.|$|E
25|$|By 1928 {{the company}} had become a PLC. Its retail {{activities}} were highlighted in a 1929 report to shareholders, with the company noting that its retail presence via its own stores helped to maintain even output in manufacturing, overcoming the traditional footwear-market problem of fixed 'seasons' followed by downturns in wholesale trade. In 1936 – {{during the height of}} the Depression – the company sought to raise additional share capital in order to fund expansion of manufacturing capacity and capitalise on an agreement with Delman of New York. In 1951, the shareholders' meeting reported increased profits of £72,070, despite difficult world trading conditions and rumours of a proposed reduction in UK <b>purchase</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|E

He also pressed for an increase in pensions payable to the disabled, saying that anything less than 90s. per week would be regarded as an instalment by the Royal British Legion in Northern Ireland.

40|$|Least-squares {{estimates}} of the response of gasoline consumption {{to a change in}} the gasoline price are biased toward zero, given the endogeneity of gasoline prices. A seemingly natural solution to this problem is to instrument for gasoline prices using gasoline taxes, but this approach tends to yield implausibly large price elasticities. We demonstrate that anticipatory behavior provides an important explanation for this result. Gasoline buyers increase <b>purchases</b> before <b>tax</b> increases and delay <b>purchases</b> before <b>tax</b> decreases, rendering the tax instrument endogenous. Including suitable leads and lags in the regression restores the validity of the IV estimator, resulting in much lower elasticity estimates...|$|R

The protocol regulates the relationship and interaction between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in six major areas: customs, taxes, labor, agriculture, industry and tourism.

25|$|The {{damage was}} {{relatively}} short-lived. Macmillan's position improved {{within a few}} months of the affair. Butler was moved from the position of Home Secretary and appointed First Secretary of State. Macmillan made out that it was the equivalent of Deputy Prime Minister, a post that had lapsed after 1955. It was in actuality a demotion. Butler was tasked with overseeing the Central African Office, which moved him away from the more powerful state offices. With Lloyd replaced as Chancellor by Maudling, Macmillan pushed ahead with reflation. The more cautious Lloyd had rejected reflation because of the risk of ultimately damaging the economy with a balance of payments crisis. Maudling however was prepared to accept the devaluation of sterling and the placement of controls on imports to stave off this eventuality. By the time of the party conference Macmillan's popularity within his party had largely recovered. Maudling reversed Lloyd's austerity measures that November, following this up with cutting the tax on motor cars, and reducing the bank rate and <b>purchase</b> <b>tax.</b> In the Spring 1963 budget he abolished the Schedule A tax, one of the main causes of dissatisfaction with the Conservatives, and a move which Lloyd had resisted. Liberal fortunes, which rested largely on the unpopularity of these policies, declined thereafter. Labour recovered by early 1963 as the exceptionally harsh winter that year drove up unemployment and the economy unexpectedly faltered.|$|E

The retail price for the lavishly packaged triple album was set at $12.98 in America and an extraordinarily high £5.50 in the UK, due to the <b>purchase</b> <b>tax</b> surcharge there. The prices drew some criticism, from Harrison for one, {{even if it was}} accepted that the proceeds were going to those in desperate need – or, as Beatles Forever author Nicholas Schaffner wrote in 1977, to [...] "a nation still viewed as the worst pocket of misery on earth".

2500|$|The Parliament of Norway set {{the goal}} to reach 50,000 zero {{emission}} vehicles by 2018. Among the existing incentives, all-electric cars are exempt in Norway from all non-recurring vehicle fees, including <b>purchase</b> <b>taxes,</b> which are extremely high for ordinary cars, and 25% VAT on purchase, together making electric car purchase price competitive with conventional cars. As an example, by early 2013 {{the price of the}} top selling Nissan Leaf is 240,690 kroner (around [...] ) while the purchase price of the 1.3-lt Volkswagen Golf is 238,000 Krone (about [...] ).

5000|$|The other {{important}} aspect of the multiplier is that to the extent that government spending generates new consumption, it also generates [...] "new" [...] tax revenues. For example, when money is spent in a shop, <b>purchases</b> <b>taxes</b> such as VAT are paid on the expenditure, and the shopkeeper earns a higher income, and thus pays more income taxes. Therefore, although the government spends $1, it is likely that it receives back a significant proportion of the $1 in due course, making the net expenditure much less than $1. Indeed, in theory, it is possible, if the initial expenditure is targeted well, that the government could receive back more than the initial $1 expended.|$|R
