5000|$|There are a {{great many}} good films that are {{currently}} funded by idealism and proactive resourcefulness, which could easily fill entire <b>programme</b> <b>sections</b> - in fact, much more cheaply than any series. Claas Danielsen … has calculated that: „The costs of only one 43 minutes long episode of a weekly fictional series significantly exceed the entire annual budget of a weekly ducumentary programme slot. Three episodes of such a series would last just over two hours and cost an estimated 1 Million Euros. Take the same amount as the annual budget for a documentary slot, and you would get 78 programme hours for an audience of millions.” ...|$|R

50|$|When, on April 30, 1991, the Franco-German {{television}} channel Arte was established, Sabine Rollberg followed the programming policies {{of this new}} binational channel focusing on the arts and Europe with keen interest. From 1994 to 1997, she was the editor-in-chief of Arte at the channel's Strasbourg headquarters.Amongst others, the new live news programme 7 1/2 was established under her leadership. Thereby, she clearly emphasised the significance of pluralism and opinion forming in a common Europe: „We {{are more than just}} an arts channel. The second string to our bow, and our other major concern, is Europe. (…) In this day and age, our home is Europe. Unfortunately, our programme is not in line with current trends, as all countries are showing a propensity towards national egotism. International issues, regrettably, find less favour, but we are deliberately swimming against the current, since Europe is close to our hearts.“In 1999 (after two years of maternity leave in Moscow), she returned to Cologne as the WDR's Arte Commissioner and Managing Editor of Arte/3Sat in the WDR. From October 2005 to the end of 2009, she managed the department of the <b>programme</b> <b>section</b> Arts Channels (Programmgruppe Kulturkanäle) in the WDR and helped set up the satellite TV channel Einsfestival.
