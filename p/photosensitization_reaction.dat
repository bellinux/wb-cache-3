In situ photosensitizer fluorescence measurements {{confirmed that the}} <b>photosensitization</b> <b>reaction</b> proceeds by an electron transfer process. Transient phosphorescence studies demonstrated that electron transfer occurred from the triplet excited state of anthracene to the initiator, with an intrinsic kinetic rate constant of 2 108 L/mol s.

Finally, numerical solution of the photophysical kinetic equations indicated that the triplet state concentration was approximately three orders of magnitude higher than that of the singlet state, and that 94 - 96 % of the active cationic centers are produced by reaction of the initiator with the triplet state.

40|$|An {{increasingly}} popular theory ascribes UVA (> 320 – 400 nm) carcinogenicity {{to the ability}} of this wavelength to trigger intracellular <b>photosensitization</b> <b>reactions,</b> thereby giving rise to promutagenic oxidative DNA damage. We have tested this theory both at the genomic and nucleotide resolution level in mouse embryonic fibroblasts carrying the lambda phage cII transgene. We have also tested the hypothesis that inclusion of a cellular photosensitizer (riboflavin) can intensify UVA-induced DNA damage and mutagenesis, whereas addition of an antioxidant (vitamin C) can counteract the induced effects. Cleavage assays with formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg) coupled to alkaline gel electrophoresis and ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) showed that riboflavin treatment (1 μM) combined with UVA 1 (340 – 400 nm) irradiation (7. 68 J/cm 2) or higher dose UVA 1 irradiation alone induced Fpg-sensitive sites (indicative of oxidized and/or ring-opened purines) in the overall genome and in the cII transgene, respectively. Also, the combined treatment with riboflavin and UVA 1 irradiation gave rise to single-strand DNA breaks in the genome and in the cII transgene determined by terminal transferase-dependent PCR (TD-PCR). A cotreatment with vitamin C (1 mM) efficiently inhibited the formation of the induced lesions. Mutagenicity analysis showed that riboflavin treatment combined with UVA 1 irradiation or high-dose UVA 1 irradiation alone significantly increased the relative frequency of cII mutants, both mutation spectra exhibiting significant increases in the relative frequency of G:C → T:A transversions, the signature mutations of oxidative DNA damage. The induction of cII mutant frequency was effectively reduced consequent to a cotreatment with vitamin C.

The mechanism for photodynamic therapy involves singlet oxygen (1 O 2) generated by energy transfer from photosensitizers. 1 O 2 can react with 3, 7 -dihydro- 6 -{ 4 -{ 2 -(N′-(5 -fluoresceinyl) thioureido) ethoxy}phenyl}- 2 -methylimidazo{ 1, 2 -a}pyrazin- 3 -one sodium salt (FCLA), {{which is a}} Cypridina luciferin analog and a specific chemiluminescence probe for detecting 1 O 2 and superoxide (O 2 −). The reaction of FCLA and 1 O 2 can give emission with peak wavelength at about 532 nm. In the present study, FCLA was chosen as an optical reporter of 1 O 2 produced from the <b>photosensitization</b> <b>reaction</b> of hematoporphyrin derivative in model solution and in nude mice with transplanted mammary cancer. Photosensitized chemiluminescence from the reaction of FCLA with 1 O 2 was detected by a highly sensitive Intensified Charge-Coupled Device detector.

Based on these studies, we would expect the viscosity change during polymerization to {{have a profound effect on}} the rate of photosensitization due to a marked decrease in the rates of the diffusion-controlled bimolecular reactions.

Several porphyrins and psoralens, as model compounds representing examples of endogenous and exogenous photosensitizers, were examined {{for their ability to}} (a) produce singlet oxygen and superoxide anions, (b) induce damage to membranes and associated microsomal P- 450, (c) promote lipid peroxidation of microsomal lipids of liver and epidermal cells, and (d) induce skin <b>photosensitization</b> <b>reactions</b> in vivo. Dose-response study in vitro of singlet oxygen production in H 2 O and D 2 O and inhibition studies involving the production of singlet oxygen and superoxide anion by specific quenchers indicated significant production of singlet oxygen by porphyrins, about 5 - 20 times higher than psoralen at 10 - 5 M and 10 - 6 M concentration and irradiation dose of 1 - 5 J/cm 2 of UVA (> 320 - 400 nm radiation). The comparative studies on aerobic photodegradation of microsomal P- 450 of guinea pig epidermis and liver indicated a significantly greater destruction of P- 450 with porphyrins than with psoralens. A membrane-lipid peroxidation study involving malondialdehyde production, using liver and epidermal microsomal fractions with and without porphyrins, psoralens, and UVA radiation, indicated 10 - 20 times increased production of malondialdehyde with UVA and porphyrins than with psoralens. Porphyrins did not produce superoxide anion. Psoralens, however, produced both 1 O 2 and O 2 -. In vivo photosensitization by psoralens in guinea pig skin (erythema and edema) could be selctively inhibited by the topical application of sodium azide, 1, 4 -diazabicyclo-[2, 2, 2]-octane, β-carotene, sorbitols, and superoxide dismutase, indicating a major role of singlet oxygen and also superoxide anion in psoralen-induced skin photosensitization. This study indicates that porphyrin photosensitization is primarily an oxygen-dependent, type II, photodynamic reaction targeted to lipid-rich membranes and heme protein P- 450 associated therein and involves the production of singlet oxygen as a major intermediate but not superoxide anion.

By means of optical microscopy and electro-deformation experiments, the physical damage on the vesicle membrane was followed and the phospholipids oxidation was evaluated in terms {{of changes in the}} membrane surface area and permeability. As expected, oxidation modifies structural characteristics of the phospholipids that lead to remarkable membrane alterations. By comparing DOPC- with POPC-made membranes, we observed that the rate of pore formation and vesicle degradation as a function of methylene blue concentration follows a diffusion law in the case of DOPC and a linear variation in the case of POPC. We attributed this scenario to the nucleation process of oxidized species following a diffusion-limited growth regime for DOPC {{and in the case of}} POPC a homogeneous nucleation process. On the basis of these premises, we constructed models based on reaction-diffusion equations that fit well with the experimental data.

These compounds were also examined {{for their ability to}} produce singlet oxygen and in vivo <b>photosensitization</b> <b>reaction.</b> Fluorescence and equilibrium dialysis measurements show that the complexation ability of benzoderivatives is remarkably high. Binding is less effective in the case of tetrahydrocongeners. All compounds photoreact quite effectively to DNA. The photoadducts were obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis of drug-modified DNA and were characterized by high performance liquid chromatographic elution techniques. The 3, 4 position represents the unique photoreactive site for the benzopsoralens. Denaturation-renaturation experiments confirm that the benzoderivatives are purely monofunctional, while the tetrahydrocongeners form interstrand cross-links, even though to a remarkably lesser extent than 8 -methoxypsoralen (8 -MOP). The new compounds, in the presence of long-wavelength ultraviolet radiation, are very moderately effective in forming reactive oxygen species; they are ineffective in promoting oxidation of tyrosine and 3 -(3, 4 -dihydroxyphenyl) alanine to dopachrome and melanin. Skin photosensitizing experiments on guinea pigs indicate that benzo- and tetrahydrobenzo-psoralens are almost devoid of any phototoxic effects.

40|$|Phototoxicity {{occurs when}} a {{substance}} is toxic only under the action of light, and can, depending on the mechanism of toxic action, be divided into type I and type II phototoxicity. Other types are sometimes recongnized, and sometimes toxicity occurs through more than one mechanism. Plants often use phototoxins for their defense. They may be harmful to man, but also exploited for medical treatments. On the other hand, drugs selected for other properties may show unwanted phototoxicity. Some fungi produce phototoxins. Due to other kinds of poisoning or to disease even the human or animal body may produce phototoxins and be harmed by them. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), widespread environmental contaminants, have a potential to become toxic or acquire increased toxicity when they inter-act with natural or simulated sunlight. Because of their chemical structure numerous PAHs absorb energy in the UV waveband. Phototoxicity of PAHs occurs mainly via photosensitiza-tion and/or photomodification reactions: <b>photosensitization</b> <b>reactions</b> of bioaccumulated PAHs in biological matrices are regarded as important mechanisms for phototoxicity, but PAHs may also be photomodified into more toxic form e. g. via photooxidation.

The quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) described in the companion paper predicted, in theory, that photosensitization and photomodification additively contribute to toxicity. To substantiate this QSAR modeling exercise {{it was necessary to}} show that toxicity can be described by empirically derived parameters. The {{toxicity of}} 16 PAHs to the duckweed Lemna gibba was measured as inhibition of leaf production in simulated solar radiation (a light source with a spectrum similar to that of sunlight). A predictive model for toxicity was generated based on the theoretical model developed in the companion paper. The photophysical descriptors required of each PAH for modeling were efficiency of photon absorbance, relative uptake, quantum yield for triplet-state formation, and the rate of photomodification. The photomodification rates of the PAHs showed a moderate correlation to toxicity, whereas a derived photosensitization factor (PSF; based on absorbance, triplet-state quantum yield, and uptake) for each PAH showed only a weak, complex correlation to toxicity. However, summing the rate of photo modification and the PSF resulted in a strong correlation to toxicity that had predictive value. When the PSF and a derived photomodification factor (PMF; based on the photomodification rate and toxicity of the photo modified P AHs) were summed, an excellent explanatory model of toxicity was produced, substantiating the additive contributions of the two factors.

The photoinhibitory efficiency of saturating xenon flashes {{was found to be}} directly proportional to flash energy and independent of the time interval between the flashes.

Furthermore, the relationship between the rate constant of photoinactivation and photon flux density was similar for flashes and continuous light when Fv/Fm was used to quantify photoinactivation, suggesting that continuous-light photoinactivation has a mechanism in which the quantum yield does not depend on the mode of delivery of light. A similar quantum yield of photoinhibition for flashes and continuous light is compatible with the manganese-based photoinhibition mechanism and with mechanisms in which singlet oxygen, produced via a direct <b>photosensitization</b> <b>reaction,</b> is the agent of damage.

A typical azo disperse dye (CI disperse yellow 7 -DY 7) and an anthraquinone disperse dye (CI disperse orange - DO 11) were used as the probe compounds.

40|$|International audienceBoth UV and {{ionizing}} radiations damage DNA.

The direct effect of radiation corresponds to direct ionization of DNA (one electron ejection) whereas indirect effects are produced by reactive oxygen species generated through water radiolysis, including the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals, which damage DNA. UV (and visible) light damages DNA by again two distinct mechanisms. UVC and to a lesser extend UVB photons are directly absorbed by DNA bases, generating their excited states that are at the origin of the formation of pyrimidine dimers. UVA (and visible) light by interaction with endogenous or exogenous photosensitizers induce the formation of DNA damage through <b>photosensitization</b> <b>reactions.</b> The excited photosensitizer is able to induce either a one-electron oxidation of DNA (type I) or to produce singlet oxygen (type II) that reacts with DNA. In addition, through an energy transfer from the excited photosensitizer to DNA bases (sometime called type III mechanism) formation of pyrimidine dimers could be produced. Interestingly it has been shown recently that pyrimidine dimers are also produced by direct absorption of UVA light by DNA, even if absorption of DNA bases at these wavelengths is very low. It should be stressed that some excited photosensitizers (such as psoralens) could add directly to DNA bases to generate adducts.

In order to elucidate the type of ROS produced by the photosensitizaion reaction in relation to the proposed CL reaction, we investigated the quenching effect of selective ROS scavengers in the luminol CL. Although several ROS were generated, superoxide anion was the most effective ROS for the generated CL. Moreover, the enhancement mechanism of DHPA for luminol CL was confirmed. The enhancement was found to be through the formation of stabilized semiquinone anion radical that provided long-lived CL. The generation of the semiquinone radical was confirmed by electron spin resonance technique.

Proto IX-sensitized and singlet oxygen (1 O 2) -mediated oxidative stress caused by AF-Na treatment impaired photosystem I (PSI), photosystem II (PSII) and whole chain electron transport reactions. As compared to controls, the Fv/Fm (variable to maximal chlorophyll a fluorescence) ratio of treated samples was reduced. The PSII electron donor NH 2 OH failed to restore the Fv/Fm ratio suggesting that the reduction of Fv/Fm reflects the loss of reaction center functions. This explanation is further supported by the practically near-similar loss of PSI and PSII activities. As revealed from the light saturation curve (rate of oxygen evolution {{as a function of}} light intensity), the reduction of PSII activity was both due to the reduction in the quantum yield at limiting light intensities and impairment of light-saturated electron transport. In treated cotyledons both the Q (due to recombination of QA− with S 2) and B (due to recombination of QB− with S 2 /S 3) band of thermoluminescence decreased by 50 % suggesting a loss of active PSII reaction centers. In both the control and treated samples, the thermoluminescence yield of B band exhibited a periodicity of 4 suggesting normal functioning of the S states in centers that were still active. The low temperature (77  K) fluorescence emission spectra revealed that the F 695 band (that originates in CP- 47) increased probably due to reduced energy transfer from the CP 47 to the reaction center. These demonstrated an overall damage to the PSI and PSII reaction centers by 1 O 2 produced in response to <b>photosensitization</b> <b>reaction</b> of protoporphyrin IX in AF-Na-treated cucumber seedlings...|$|E

Limited information is available in elucidating the mode of action of CCT in clearing psoriasis or causing skin photosensitization reactions. The production of singlet oxygen (1 O 2) and superoxide radicals (O· 2 - or HO 2), the formation of interstrand cross-links (ICL) in DNA, and the skin <b>photosensitization</b> <b>reaction</b> caused by CCT or the ingredients present in tar preparations have been examined. Both type I (oxygen-independent) and type II (sensitized reactions requiring molecular oxygen) reactions are induced by CCT. Our data show that CCT and some of the photoreactive ingredients present in CCT produce 1 O 2, 0 · 2 -, and ICL in DNA upon exposure to UVA radiation. Based on the equivalent concentration, the efficiency of various agents to produce 1 O 2 was of the following order: hematoporphyrin > phenanthridine > acridine > methylene blue > CCT > fluoranthrene > anthracene > pyrene > 8 -methoxypsoralen > anthralin > chloroquine > anthralin dimer. The 0 · 2 - formation with CCT and its ingredients was also of the same order except for anthracene which was found to be a strong producer of 0 · 2 -.

The transparency of the lens is important for proper vision. Because there is little protein turnover in the lens, modification to the protein accumulates over many years and may lead to cataract formation. Approximately 95 % of Americans over 65 years old have some type of cataract formation. Cataracts are also the cause of 42 % of blindness worldwide. During aging, the lens protein undergoes yellowing, cleavage, an increase in fluorescence, and a decrease in solubility. Concomitantly, the concentrations of several antioxidants and the tryptophan metabolites, kynurenine, 3 -hydroxykynurenine (3 -HK) and 3 -hydroxykynurenine glucoside (3 -HKG), decrease. Several groups have proposed that 3 -HK or 3 -HKG, which protect the retina by absorbing UV light, may become covalently attached to the protein. The yellowed protein may cause further damage in the lens through <b>photosensitization</b> <b>reactions.</b> The mechanisms of lens protein modification are not known, but likely reactions involve light, reactive oxygen species, protein glycation, and decreases in enzyme activity. The mechanisms involved in aging of the lens are complex; therefore, simple models have been used in this work. alpha-Crystallin, the most abundant lens protein, and 3 -HK have been irradiated with UV light under conditions similar to those in the lens to study the mechanisms of photochemical damage. Changes in absorption, fluorescence and of the transient excited states of photochemically modified alpha-crystallin are similar to those found in cataractous lens protein. An absorbed dose of light has been correlated with an apparent age of the model and protein yellowing allowing lenticular aging to be quantified for the first time. The 3 -HK mediated photolysis of alpha-crystallin has been found to lead to cleavage of the protein backbone and amino acid side chains which may contribute to the formation of degraded forms of the crystallins and the high molecular weight aggregates observed in vivo. Photochemical damage of glutathione reductase, an enzyme responsible for protection against oxidative damage, may also occur via excited states of its cofactors. Cleavage of 3 -HKG by a beta-glucosidase may contribute to damage of the lens nucleus. Once the mechanisms of damage in the lens are better understood, cataract formation may be slowed or prevented...|$|R

30|$|To {{investigate}} whether photo-oxidation of Type I or II are the predominant action mechanisms; d-mannitol, a quencher of hydroxyl radical (Type I) and tryptophan or sodium azide, quenchers of singlet oxygen (Type II) were used (Street et al. 2009). The results, resumed in Table  2, show that under these conditions, sodium azide (10  mM), {{which is known}} to react especially with singlet oxygen (Costa et al. 2013) and mainly as a physical quencher of 1 O 2 (Bancirova 2011), failed to show any bacteria protection as the same survival fraction (20 %) for the RB alone was obtained. As shown in Table  2, l-Trp, used as singlet oxygen trapping agent (Street et al. 2009), protected significantly S. aureus against photoactivated RB by 78 % (its survival is more than 99 %; 0.69 log units reduction on bacteria photoinactivation rate) after 10  min of phototreatment (ANOVA, p[*]<[*] 0.05). The same extent of S. aureus protection as obtained by l-Trp, occurred {{in the presence of}} d-mannitol, as an alcoholic sugar which has an antioxidant effect; it reacts especially with hydroxyl free radical (Liang et al. 2008; Al-Omari and Ali 2009). Accordingly, this substance {{is considered to be a}} strong free radical scavenger (Sagone et al. 1983; Kamat et al. 2000). Some experiments have shown that it can prevent enzymes inactivation such as glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD), nitrate-reductase and sulphite oxidase by ionizing radiations (Eichler et al. 1987). d-mannitol can protect supercoiled DNA from hydroxyl radical damage due to ionizing radiation (Peak et al. 1995). The rate of photoprotection powered by l-Trp and d-mannitol was significant (ANOVA, p[*]<[*] 0.05) during the first 10  min of illumination (Table  2). These results prove that the RB <b>photosensitization</b> <b>reaction,</b> was especially proceeded by the Type I pathway generating predominantly hydroxyl radicals (.OH) and Type II (1 O 2 production). For sodium azide as singlet oxygen quencher, there is no bacterial protection than that obtained in the presence of l-Trp which was comparable to that obtained with d-mannitol, used as free radical scavenger. The results obtained for sodium azide and l-Trp with the RB are unexpected since both are considered in the literature, as singlet oxygen quenchers (Tavares et al. 2011). The results obtained show that the selection of l-Trp as singlet oxygen quencher can give, depending on the PS, erroneous information about the type of mechanism involved in the photodynamic inactivation process. Thirty minutes after treatment by RB and light, the sensitized S. aureus lost more than 90 % of its viability (reduction of 1 log unit). The same rate of killing occurred in the presence of quenchers which failed to show any protection (Table  2). On the other hand, the quenchers that proved their protective ability showed that the killing rate in their presence was reduced to almost the same extent as the protection provided by them. We propose two possible explanations. The first one is that RB molecules, in the absence of culture media (in saline), might be in close contact with the bacteria, ROS produced mainly HO. and 1 O 2, might not be stopped efficiently by quenchers with increasing contact time. Consequently, a high percentage of the bacteria population is killed. Similar explanation was reported by Nitzan et al. (1989) under their own experimental conditions. The second explanation concerns the concentration used of the quenchers. In fact, in all the protection experiments, the amount of the proposed quenchers was 500 -fold higher than the amount of the RB added to the culture. According to authors, a plausible explanation can be the use of low quencher concentrations. The choice of the folding between PS and quenchers used was inspired from the work of Nitzan et al. (1989), in all their protection experiments, the amount of the proposed quencher was 70 – 700 -fold higher than the amount of the overall PS added to the culture.|$|E
30|$|According to author knowledge, {{little is}} known about the effect of xanthenes dyes on {{bacterial}} membrane functions. Recently, Kato et al. (2012) showed the amounts of the dye bound to S. aureus cells estimated to be 54 % at 1  µM. This amount was correlated with the potency of dye-induced photoinactivation of bacterial membrane functions. Demidova and Hamblin (2005) showed that the anionic dye RB had no detectable binding to S. aureus but was nevertheless highly efficient in mediating PDI killing. Most common, Gram-positive species lack a barrier comparable to the outer Gram-negative-bacteria cell wall. For this reason, Dahl et al. (1988) moved forward that anionic compounds, such as RB, which are excluded from the Gram-negative bacterial cell interior, may penetrate the Gram-positive exterior more readily. This is in agreement with our result referring to the absorption spectrum change (particularly bathochromic effect) when S. aureus was irradiated for 10  min in the presence of RB. In its presence, two distinct behaviours were observed when l-Trp and NaN 3 were used as singlet oxygen quenchers. In fact, the presence of l-Trp (10  mM) led to a bacterial protection similar to the one observed with d-mannitol; while in the presence of sodium azide, no protection was detected. The high inhibition of the PS activity by l-Trp would not only be due to its singlet oxygen quencher ability but also to the interaction between RB and l-Trp as witnessed by spectrophotometric study. Many available literature data have shown that RB was well-known to operate via the Type II photosensitization mechanism (Redmon and Gamlin 1999; Gracanin et al. 2009) which were associated to the environment of the PS, and to the absence of pre-defined parameters for using PDI according to their experimental conditions (Rossoni et al. 2010). This paper represents a report of the mechanisms of RB photodynamic inactivation of S. aureus in phosphate buffer solution (PBS). The main objective was to determine which ROS is more effective for S. aureus using RB that tend to undergo Type I and/or Type II mechanisms (OH. and 1 O 2, respectively), as the two highly active oxidizing agents involved in photodynamic inactivation or phototherapy (Huang et al. 2012; Wen et al. 2017). The obtained data suggested that the RB <b>photosensitization</b> <b>reaction,</b> was especially proceeded by the Type I pathway (hydroxyl radicals (OH.) quenched by mannitol) and Type II (1 O 2 quenched by Trp). Surprisingly, nonquenchable 1 O 2 was detected in the presence of sodium azide (NaN 3), as a well-known singlet oxygen quencher. In agreement with the results obtained and aforementioned, an explanation of mechanisms of the RB photodynamic action against S. aureus is that a possible quenching of the RB excited triplet state (3 RB*) by l-Trp has been proposed, as a concomitant consequence of interaction between 3 RB* and l-Trp and it found to give rise to a large absorption change near 410  nm, and may compete with reaction between Trp and singlet oxygen (1 O 2) in aqueous solution. Although, the precise nature of this interaction, products generated and their contribution have not been elucidated, it has been reported by Seret and Van de Vorst (1990) that the quenching of triplet excited state of RB (3 RB*) by Trp in aqueous solution, generated semireduced RB as a product obtained through this interaction, but no information about rate constants was given in their research (Criado et al. 1996). Therefore, this interaction between RB and l-Trp would be the cause of reduction of the RB microbial killing not as a reactive product. This explains the lack of correlation between RB photoinactivation efficiency and its interaction capability with Trp shown by our study. In summary, not only the use of singlet oxygen quenchers and of the free radical scavengers as simple approach to determine which pathway(s) is (are) involved in PDI (Nitzan et al. 1989; Song et al. 1999; Huang et al. 2012) but also the spectroscopic study of possible interaction between the PS and some quenchers such as Trp, used in this study, in the presence of bacteria, are important characteristics for determining photochemical mechanisms involved in the photodynamic process. Spectral studies can be a simple and useful screening gate to understand more of the mechanisms action of PSs used for wastewater disinfection.|$|E
40|$|Non-melanoma skin cancers {{are among}} the most common {{malignancies}} with an incidence increasing worldwide at a rate of 3 % to 8 % per year. Generally, these tumors have a favorable prognosis when treated early. Due to the easy access of the skin to light-based therapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a particularly well-suited treatment option for such skin diseases. PDT is a relatively new treatment modality that combines the administration of a photosensitizer and subsequent targeted irradiation with visible light to generate an oxygen dependent destruction of the diseased tissue. Topically applied photosensitizers are preferred for dermatological PDT because of the reduced risk for prolonged skin photosensitivity, which is often the case after systemic administration. Yet, fundamental for a successful topical application is an adequate penetration of the molecule in the skin. Hereby, the impermeability of the skin, especially of the outermost stratum corneum (SC), is a considerable problem. Early preliminary tests investigating the topical application of hypericin, a photosensitizer present in Hypericum perforatum, had shown promising results as hypericin was found to penetrate sufficiently into the skin of hairless mice to induce a <b>photosensitization</b> <b>reaction.</b> The former results in mind, the therapeutic potential of topical hypericin-PDT targeted to certain skin diseases like actinic keratosis (AK) and disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) was explored comprehensively. The starting point of this thesis was the development and optimization of a topical formulation for the delivery of hypericin in the skin. The in vivo penetration of hypericin in the skin was investigated using a hairless mouse model. By means of fluorescence microscopy of treated skin sections, the characteristics of the hypericin skin penetration and relative delivery efficiency were evaluated using ten well-tried semisolid vehicles from pharmacopoeias and compounding formularies. After a 4 -h application of 0. 1 % hypericin in PEG ointment, white petrolatum or unguentum emulsificans, analysis revealed penetration to be confined to the SC. On the contrary, cremor non ionicus, ung. sorbatis 100 but especially Beeler base caused penetration of hypericin in the viable epidermis, considered the main target site for PDT. From this first study it also became clear that a hypericin depot was formed within the SC. Phototoxicity experiments furthermore showed that hypericin (and its acetate ester) is an effective photosensitizer after topical application. Moreover, we found that phototoxicity can be evoked up to one week after topical application of hypericin (acetate) and that, after irradiation, phototoxicity lasts for about 2 - 3 weeks. The delivery of hypericin in the skin was then further improved by refinement of the best formula (Beeler base) and application conditions. Experiments with different hypericin concentrations and application times indicated that application of 0. 1 % hypericin for 12 to 24 h maximized the accumulation of hypericin related-fluorescence in the skin. Incorporation of ethanol (40 %, integrated in a gel for addition to Beeler base) increased the fluorescence levels in all skin layers dramatically. Subsequently, the optimized conditions were used to investigate the penetration of hypericin into UV induced skin tumors. It was found that application under occlusion of hypericin formulated in the gelcream during 24 h, enabled the penetration of hypericin in the entire skin lesions resulting in a relatively homogenous distribution. In search for the most favorable vehicle for the delivery of hypericin in the skin, our results suggested the potential of 0. 1 % hypericin in a gelcream with ethanol for topical PDT of skin lesions. Using these optimized conditions, a second part of the thesis covered an efficacy study of topical hypericin-PDT in an animal model for AK. To place the results with hypericin into perspective, similar experiments were conducted with a clinically used photosensitizer precursor, methyl aminolevulinic acid (Me-ALA). Our results demonstrated that longer application times were needed with hypericin and even then skin penetration was lesser than with Me-ALA. Moreover, after topical application of hypericin, the tumor selectivity (as evaluated by the lesional/non-lesional skin surface fluorescence ratio) was limited and is likely more dependent on the SC characteristics than on the tumor features. The efficacy of topical hypericin-PDT (44 % total lesional clearance) was also found to be limited as compared to Me-ALA-PDT (80 % total lesional clearance). Most likely, the poor outcome observed is due to the failure of the formulation to deliver hypericin sufficiently into the deeper layers of the epidermal lesions. Hypericin-PDT was also trialed in 2 DSAP patients, who were unresponsive to other treatments. No clearance of the lesions was achieved after 3 hypericin-PDT treatments. A partial response was obtained in one patient yet the occurrence of hyperpigmentation was a complicating factor for the use of hypericin-PDT. In conclusion, our results suggest that topical hypericin-PDT does not emerge as a promising treatment for skin pathology. The reason for this is most likely the poor penetration of hypericin in the viable skin layers. The affinity of hypericin for the SC and the resulting accumulation therein will be a returning problem for the topical delivery of hypericin. However, physical methods, removing or circumventing the SC, might improve the skin penetration of hypericin. status: publishe...|$|E

Excessive exposure to solar UVA is a known contributor to skin photoaging and photocarcinogenesis, associated with increased incidence rates and a significant health burden imposed by skin cancer worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying UVA-induced skin photodamage remain largely undefined. UVA radiation has been shown to cause cutaneous oxidative stress and <b>photosensitization</b> <b>reactions</b> involving the light-driven photochemistry of specific skin chromophores upstream of reactive oxygen species formation, recognized as key players in skin photooxidative damage. Consequently, there has been significant interest in the identification of endogenous compounds that facilitate these reactions serving as endogenous photosensitizers. In my graduate research, we assessed the potential of selected endogenous chromophores, pyridoxal and 6 -formylindolo[3, 2 -b]carbazole (FICZ), to elicit UVA-induced photo- and genotoxicity in relevant models of human skin, and further identified the underlying molecular mechanisms involved. We demonstrated {{for the first time that}} the B 6 -vitamer pyridoxal, previously shown to contain the phototoxic 3 -hydroxypyridine moiety, is a micromolar sensitizer of UVA-induced genotoxicity in human primary keratinocytes and human epidermal reconstructs, which may be relevant to human skin exposed to high concentrations of B 6 -vitamers. Additionally, we have demonstrated that FICZ, a tryptophan photoproduct and endogenous high-affinity aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist, as the most potent endogenous UVA- and visible light-activated photosensitizer identified as of today. FICZ potentiates photooxidative stress, an effect that occurs independent of AhR ligand activity. Given the extraordinary photodynamic potency of FICZ, which surpasses that of any known endogenous photosensitizer, including protoporphyrin IX, and its rapid metabolic turnover, we tested the feasibility of using FICZ for the photodynamic elimination of malignant skin cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Indeed, light photoactivation of FICZ-induced phototoxidative damage and cytotoxicity in a panel of cultured human malignant skin cells, and furthermore suppressed post-UVB tumorigenic progression in high-risk SKH- 1 mice. Based on these pilot studies, follow up experiments will further optimize FICZ-based photodynamic interventions targeting human skin malignancies in relevant model systems. In pursuit of minimizing the need for invasive therapeutic methods, exploitation of stress response pathways has become a topic of interest for interventions aimed at the eradication of skin cancer at early or late progressional stages. Therefore, we tested feasibility of harnessing the cellular metal stress response for the elimination of skin cancer cells using the zinc-ionophore and FDA-approved microbicidal agent zinc pyrithione (ZnPT). Indeed, in a panel of cultured malignant skin cancer cells it was observed that ZnPT treatment caused rapid intracellular zinc overload and redox dysregulation, followed by a loss of genomic integrity and induction of caspase-independent cell death. In a murine photocarcinogenesis model, chronic topical ZnPT-administration post-UV caused epidermal zinc-overload and stress response gene expression with pronounced blockade of tumorigenic progression. These data suggest the feasibility of repurposing a topical OTC-drug for zinc-directed photochemoprevention of solar UV-induced nonmelanoma skin cancer. In summary, these studies contribute to our mechanistic understanding of photosensitizer- and zinc-induced stress responses in human skin, and furthermore provide the molecular basis for innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at the elimination of skin cancer cells...|$|R
