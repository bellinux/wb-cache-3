5|$|Wife selling {{persisted in}} England {{in some form}} until the early 20th century; {{according}} to the jurist and historian James Bryce, writing in 1901, wife sales were still occasionally taking place during his time.

5|$|Consequent to {{his defense}} of an African American who was forced into a form of {{commercial}} slavery after incarceration, Black was befriended by A. O. Lane, a judge connected with the case. When Lane {{was elected to the}} Birmingham City Commission in 1911, he asked Black to serve as a <b>police</b> <b>court</b> judge, an experience that would be his only judicial experience prior to the Supreme Court. In 1912, Black resigned that seat in order to return to practicing law full-time. He was not done with public service; in 1914, he began a four-year term as the Jefferson County Prosecuting Attorney.|$|E

5|$|Identity parades {{were held}} at Bishopsgate police station on 23 December. Isaac Levy, who had seen the group leaving Exchange Buildings, {{identified}} Peters and Dubof as the two he had seen carrying Gardstein. It was also ascertained that Federoff had been witnessed at the events. The following day Federoff, Peters and Dubof all appeared at the Guildhall <b>police</b> <b>court</b> where they were charged with being connected {{to the murder of}} the three policemen, and with conspiracy to burgle the jewellery shop. All three pleaded not guilty.|$|E
5|$|On 27 December {{the poster}} bearing Gardstein's picture {{was seen by}} his landlord, who alerted police. Wensley and his colleagues visited the lodgings on Gold Street, Stepney and found knives, a gun, ammunition, false {{passports}} and revolutionary publications. Two days later there was another hearing at the Guildhall <b>police</b> <b>court.</b> In addition to Federoff, Peters and Dubof, present in the dock were Milstein and Trassjonsky. With some of the defendants having a low standard of English, interpreters were used throughout the proceedings. At {{the end of the}} day the case was adjourned until 6 January 1911.|$|E

5|$|As a boy, Jinnah {{lived for}} a time in Bombay with an aunt and may have {{attended}} the Gokal Das Tej Primary School there, later on studying at the Cathedral and John Connon School. In Karachi, he attended the Sindh-Madrasa-tul-Islam and the Christian Missionary Society High School. He gained his matriculation from Bombay University at the high school. In his later years and especially after his death, a large number of stories about the boyhood of Pakistan's founder were circulated: that he spent all his spare time at the <b>police</b> <b>court,</b> listening to the proceedings, and that he studied his books by the glow of street lights for lack of other illumination. His official biographer, Hector Bolitho, writing in 1954, interviewed surviving boyhood associates, and obtained a tale that the young Jinnah discouraged other children from playing marbles in the dust, urging them to rise up, keep their hands and clothes clean, and play cricket instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Hastings became {{involved}} in the Savidge Inquiry. Sir Leo Chiozza Money was a noted journalist, economist and former Liberal MP. On 23 April 1928, he and Miss Irene Savidge were sitting in Hyde Park in London when they were arrested by two plain-clothes police officers and taken to the nearest police station, where they were charged under the Parks Regulation Act 1872 with committing an indecent offence. The next morning, they were remanded for a week at Great Marlborough Street <b>Police</b> <b>Court.</b> At the next hearing a week later, the case was dismissed by the magistrate, who criticised the police for failing to contact a man seen running through the park to establish some kind of corroborative evidence, and failing to report at once to Scotland Yard to avoid having to charge the defendants immediately.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, 1904, Barkley {{declared}} his candidacy for county attorney of McCracken County {{well before the}} March 1905 Democratic primary. The Republicans did not nominate a candidate, so the Democratic primary was the de facto general election. Barkley faced two opponents in the primary – two-term incumbent Eugene A. Graves and Paducah <b>Police</b> <b>Court</b> Judge David Cross. He organized his own campaign and made speeches across the county, showcasing his eloquence and likeability. Graves received more votes than Barkley in Paducah, but McCracken County's rural farmers gave Barkley the victory, 1,525 votes to 1,096; Cross came in third with 602 votes. This {{was the only time}} Barkley ever challenged an incumbent Democrat.|$|E

His brother's {{wife and his}} adopted daughter also received shares. Every servant received £5, as did each teacher in the school. Every factory employee received £2. Several individuals received monthly incomes of £1 or £2 a month. Croydon General Hospital, the Croydon Natural History Society, The British Home and Hospital for Incurables, Croydon <b>Police</b> <b>Court</b> Relief Fund and Croydon Society for the Protection of Women and Children all received shares, as did the Croydon Corporation, although these were {{to be used for}} the purchase of books annually to be used as prizes for students in Croydon.|$|E

25|$|Stewart {{apparently}} {{made good}} on this claim as he was found hanged in his cell {{half an hour later}} by one of the police doorman.

However, Kisch was released on bail when his lawyer took an appeal to High Court Justice Evatt, who again ruled that Kisch be set free.

25|$|Dana {{made the}} Sun a Democratic newspaper, {{independent}} and outspoken in {{the expression of}} its opinions respecting the affairs of either party. His criticisms of civil maladministration during General Grant's terms as president led to a notable attempt {{on the part of}} that administration, in July 1873, to take him from New York on a charge of libel, to be tried without a jury in a Washington <b>police</b> <b>court.</b> Application was made to the United States District Court in New York for a warrant of removal, but in a memorable decision Judge Blatchford, later a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, refused the warrant, holding the proposed form of trial to be unconstitutional. Perhaps {{to a greater extent than}} in the case of any other conspicuous journalist, Dana's personality was identified in the public mind with the newspaper that he edited.|$|E

He also taught part-time at the Faculty of Law of the University of Singapore when it was started in 1956. In 1961, he represented Singapore at the Seminar on the Protection of Human Rights in the Administration of Criminal Justice organised by the United Nations in Wellington, New Zealand. With effect from 1 September 1963, he became the Solicitor-General, succeeding T. Kulasekaram who had been appointed a Supreme Court judge. He was then appointed Acting Attorney-General from 1 February 1967 to 31 December 1968, and as Attorney-General from 1 January 1969 to 30 April 1992. Tan was 39 {{years old when he}} became Attorney-General, and {{is believed to have been}} the youngest person to hold this post.
