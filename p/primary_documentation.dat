25|$|Lake {{attributed}} {{the gun to}} Wyatt Earp, but modern researchers have not found any supporting evidence from secondary sources or in available <b>primary</b> <b>documentation</b> of the gun's existence prior to the publication of Lake's book. After its publication, various Colt revolvers with long (10-inch or 16-inch) barrels were called Colt Buntlines or Buntline Specials. Colt manufactured the pistol among its second-generation revolvers produced after 1956. A number of other manufacturers, such as Uberti, Navy Arms, and Cimarron Arms, have made their own versions of this long-barreled revolver.|$|E
25|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>documentation</b> for {{attributions}} {{comes from}} the Venetian collector Marcantonio Michiel. In notes dating from 1525 to 1543 he identifies twelve paintings and one drawing as by Giorgione, of which five of the paintings are identified virtually unanimously with surviving works by art historians: The Tempest, The Three Philosophers, Sleeping Venus, Boy with an Arrow, and Shepherd with a Flute (not all accept the last as by Giorgione however). Michiel describes the Philosophers as having been completed by Sebastiano del Piombo, and the Venus as finished by Titian (it is now generally agreed that Titian did the landscape). Some recent art historians also involve Titian in the Three Philosophers. The Tempest is therefore {{the only one of}} the group universally accepted as wholly by Giorgione. In addition, the Castelfranco Altarpiece in his home-town has rarely, if ever, been doubted, nor have the wrecked fresco fragments from the German warehouse. The Vienna Laura is the only work signed and dated by Giorgione (on the back). The early pair of paintings in the Uffizi are usually accepted.|$|E

2500|$|Kingsley {{took three}} younger slave women as common-law wives and fathered mixed-race {{children}} {{with at least}} two of them, totaling nine children in all. All three women were slaves whom he eventually freed: they were named Flora Kingsley, Sarah Kingsley, who brought her son Micanopy; and Munsilna McGundo, who brought her daughter Fatima. The Kingsley family was, according to historian Daniel Stowell, [...] "complex at best". In his will, the only woman Kingsley named as his wife was Anna. <b>Primary</b> <b>documentation</b> by Kingsley is scarce, but historians consider Flora, Sarah, and McGundo as [...] "lesser wives", or [...] "co-wives" [...] with Anna. Stowell suggests [...] "concubines" [...] is a more accurate description of their status. Kingsley lavished all his children with affection, attention, and luxury. They were educated with the best European teaching he could afford. When he entertained visitors at his Fort George plantation, Anna sat [...] "at the head of the table"; they were [...] "surrounded by healthy and handsome children" [...] in a parlor decorated with portraits of African women.|$|E
