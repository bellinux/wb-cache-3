British distributor Manga Entertainment announced in January 2010 they had licensed Summer Wars for the United Kingdom, and {{was released}} in March 2011. In North America, Funimation released Summer Wars on DVD and Blu-ray on February 15, 2011. The North American DVD and Blu-ray releases included previews, and the interviews with Hosoda, Kamiki, Sakuraba, Fuji, Tanimura and Saitō. The first <b>press</b> <b>copies</b> included art cards. To get out enough copies to meet demand some did not ship with the OZ O-card (cardboard slip-cover), as it required specialty printing that takes longer to produce {{than the rest of}} the product. Funimation offered to send out the O-Card to customers who did not receive one as soon as they are available if they fill out a request form on their official website.|$|E
25|$|Laguna fired O'Brien {{at the end}} of the tour, {{and upon}} {{returning}} to the States, Jett, Ryan, and Ambel moved to Long Beach, New York. Auditions were set up and Lee Crystal, formerly of the Boyfriends and Sylvain Sylvain, became the new drummer. The band then toured throughout the US, slowly building a fan base but struggling to remain financially afloat. Throughout 1980, the band was able to keep touring solely due to Laguna drawing on advances from outside projects. Jett and Laguna used their personal savings to <b>press</b> <b>copies</b> of the Joan Jett album and set up their own system of distribution, sometimes selling the albums out of the trunk of Laguna's Cadillac {{at the end of}} each concert. Laguna was unable to keep up with demand for the album. Eventually, old friend and founder of Casablanca Records, Neil Bogart, made a joint venture with Laguna and signed Jett to his new label, Boardwalk Records and re-released the Joan Jett album as Bad Reputation.|$|E
500|$|The book {{continued}} to garner positive reviews and comments. In 1998, Amanda Foreman wrote for The Sunday Times of London, [...] "I want to shout about The Phantom from the rooftops.

Whether you are 8 or 88 Juster's mixture of allegorical wisdom and logical whimsy will take you on a journey of the spirit. The Phantom is a mappa mundi of our hearts, proving once again that in laughter and simplicity lies the truth of life". In a 2011 article written for the book's fiftieth anniversary, Adam Gopnik wrote, [...] "The book is made magical by Juster's and Feiffer's gift for transforming abstract philosophical ideas into unforgettable images." ...|$|E

50|$|Cuz We Can is {{an album}} by the band Rehab. Originally {{available}} online in 2002, a <b>pressed</b> <b>copy</b> was released March 13, 2007. It {{is the last}} album to feature rapper Brooks Buford as he parted ways soon after this album was released online by him.|$|R
500|$|When {{he creates}} new scripts, Davies {{considers}} the dénouement {{of a story}} to {{be representative of the}} work. He often formulates both the scene and its emotional impact early in the process, but writes the scenes last due to his belief that [...] " [...] can't exist if they aren't informed by where they've come from". Davies is a strong advocate for the continued use of the cliffhanger ending and opposes advertising that sacrifices the impact of storytelling. In pursuit of his quest, he instructs editors to remove scenes from <b>press</b> <b>copies</b> of episodes he writes; cliffhangers were removed from the review copies of the Doctor Who episodes [...] "Army of Ghosts", [...] "The Stolen Earth", and the first part of The End of Time, and Rose Tyler's unadvertised appearance in [...] "Partners in Crime" [...] was excised. His most noted cliffhanger was in the script of [...] "The Stolen Earth", which created a public sense of [...] "Doctor Who fever" [...] in the week preceding its conclusion. In an interview with BBC News shortly after the episode's transmission, he argued that the success of a popular television series is linked to how well producers can keep secrets and create a [...] "live experience": ...|$|E

2500|$|In public {{testimony}} before HUAC on Tuesday, May 21, 1952, Hellman answered preliminary {{questions about her}} background. When asked about attending a specific meeting {{at the home of}} Hollywood screenwriter Martin Berkeley, she refused to respond, claiming her rights under the Fifth Amendment and she referred the committee to her letter by way of explanation. The Committee responded that it had considered and rejected her request to be allowed to testify only about herself and entered her letter into the record. Hellman answered only one additional question: she denied she had ever belonged to the Communist Party. She cited the Fifth Amendment in response to several more questions and the committee dismissed her. Historian John Earl Haynes credits both Rauh's [...] "clever tactics" [...] and Hellman's [...] "sense of the dramatic" [...] for what followed the conclusion of Hellman's testimony. As the committee moved on to other business, Rauh released to the <b>press</b> <b>copies</b> of her letter to HUAC. Committee members, unprepared for close questioning about Hellman's stance, offered only offhand comments. The press reported Hellman's statement at length, its language crafted to overshadow the comments of the HUAC members. She wrote in part: ...|$|E

6000|$|A second Fourth Edition (1052 lines), {{published}} by [...] "James Cawthorn and Sharp & Hailes, 1811," [...] and printed by [...] "Cox, Son, & Baylis," [...] was certainly recognized by Byron as a genuine Fourth Edition, {{and must have}} passed through his hands, or been subject to his emendation, before it was sent to <b>press.</b> <b>Copies</b> of this edition bear his MS. emendations of 1811-1812, and marginal notes of 1816. Genuine copies (e.g. Leigh Hunt's copy, now in the Forster Collection at the South Kensington Museum) are printed on paper bearing a water-mark, [...] "J. Whatman, 1805." [...] There was, however, another issue of the Fourth Edition of 1811, printed on plain paper. Mr. Redgrave notes certain minute differences between these two issues. In the edition on plain paper there is a hyphen to [...] "Cockspur-Street" [...] on the title-page, and the word [...] "Street" [...] {{is followed by a}} comma instead of a semicolon. Again, in the plain-paper copies [...] "Lambe" [...] is spelt with an e, and in the water-mark copies the word is correctly spelt [...] "Lamb." [...] In the plain-paper copies the misprint [...] "Postcript" [...] for [...] "Postscript" [...] is repeated, and in the copies bearing a water-mark the word is correctly spelt [...] "Postscript."

50|$|Sneak Preview is an {{independently}} released album by {{the future}} members of King's X going {{by the name}} of Sneak Preview. Reportedly, only about 1,000 <b>copies</b> were <b>pressed.</b> The band was not very impressed with the results and may have personally destroyed about half of the <b>pressed</b> <b>copies,</b> making this album a very rare item.|$|R
50|$|A new {{teletype}} machine {{allowed the}} Evergreen to start using Associated <b>Press</b> <b>copy</b> in 1952.

50|$|Today, white labels discs are {{commonly}} used to promote new artists or upcoming albums by veteran artists. In some cases white labels are issued to conceal artist identities (examples of this include songs by Traci Lords and La Toya Jackson, whose record companies issued white labels so that DJs would have no pre-conceived notions about the music just by seeing who the artist was). Many dance music producers <b>press</b> <b>copies</b> of white labels {{in order to test}} crowd response in dance clubs to their own musical productions.|$|E
