60|$|So far as her <b>pecuniary</b> <b>resources</b> were concerned, she {{was equally}} removed from hope and fear. Twice {{a year the}} same income flowed in {{regularly}} from the same investments. What she could pay at any future time was far more plainly revealed to her than what she might owe. With tact and management {{it would be possible}} to partially satisfy creditors, and keep up appearances for six months more.

60|$|For {{the next}} five years, when once The Tragic Muse was off his hands, Henry James gave himself up with persevering {{determination}} to the writing of plays. He speaks very plainly, in his letters of the time, concerning the motives which urged him to the theatre, {{and there is no}} doubt that the chief of them was the desire for a kind of success which his fiction failed to achieve. He puts it simply that he wished to make money, that his books did not sell, and that he regarded the theatre solely as a much-needed <b>pecuniary</b> <b>resource.</b> But such belittling of his own motives--out of a feeling that was partly pride and partly shyness--was not unusual with him; and it seems impossible to take this language quite literally. For a man of letters with moderate tastes and no family, Henry James's circumstances were more than easy, even if his writings should earn him nothing at all; and he had no reason to doubt that his future was sufficiently assured. Moreover, though his work might have no great popular vogue--it had had a measure of that too, at the time of Daisy Miller--it still never wanted its own attentive circle; so that he had not to complain of the utter indifference that may wear upon the nerves of even the most disinterested artist. The sense of solitude that began to weigh upon him was perhaps more a matter of temperament than of fact; it never for a moment meant that he had lost faith in himself and his powers, but there mingled with it his inveterate habit of forecasting the future in the most ominous light. As he looked forward, he saw the undoubted decline of his popularity carrying him further and further away from recognition and its rewards; and the prospect, once the thought of it had taken root in his imagination, distressed and dismayed him. All would be righted, he felt, by the successful conquest of the theatre; there lay the way, not only to solid gains, but to the reassurance of vaguer, less formulated anxieties. With such a tangible gage of having made his impression he would be relieved for ever from the fear of working in vain and alone.|$|R

60|$|Again Lysbeth sat silent. Montalvo, {{watching}} her with genuine interest, saw signs of rebellion, perchance of despair.

Unless he was much mistaken {{she was about to}} defy him, which, as a matter of fact, would have proved exceedingly awkward, as his <b>pecuniary</b> <b>resources</b> were exhausted.

60|$|But Charley was {{not only}} {{surprised}} at the proposed arrangement, but apparently also unwilling to enter into, it. He argued {{that in the first}} place no girl in her senses would accept him. To this Alaric replied that as Clementina had not much sense to speak of, that objection might fall to the ground. Then Charley expressed an idea that Miss Golightly's friends might probably object when they learnt what were the exact <b>pecuniary</b> <b>resources</b> of the expectant husband; to which Alaric argued that the circumstances of the case were very lucky, inasmuch as some of Clementina's natural friends were already prepossessed in favour of such an arrangement.|$|E
60|$|Any man, {{even in our}} time, {{who makes}} an {{imprudent}} marriage, knows how he has to run the gauntlet of the family, and undergo the abuse, the scorn, the wrath, the pity of his relations.

60|$|Once {{provided}} with <b>pecuniary</b> <b>resources,</b> Zack felt himself {{at liberty to}} indulge forthwith in a holiday of his own granting. He opened the festival by a good long ride in a cab, {{with a bottle of}} pale ale and a packet of cigars inside, to keep the miserable state of the weather from affecting his spirits. He closed the festival with a visit to the theater, a supper in mixed company, total self-oblivion, a bed at a tavern, and a blinding headache the next morning. Thus much, in brief, for the narrative of his holiday. The proceedings, on his part, which followed that festival, claim attention next; and are of sufficient importance, in the results to which they led, to be mentioned in detail.|$|E

She shows a morbid distrust of writing her name at the bottom of any document which I present to her, and roundly declares she will sign nothing. As long as it is her interest to provide herself with <b>pecuniary</b> <b>resources</b> for the future, she verbally engages to go on. When it ceases to be her interest, she plainly threatens to leave off at a week's notice. A difficult girl to deal with; she has found out her own value to me already.

I believe I am not using too strong an {{expression}} when I say that Another was hard up. However, he married the young lady, and {{they lived in a}} humble dwelling, probably possessing a porch ornamented with honeysuckle and woodbine twining, until she died. I must refer you to the Registrar of the District in which the humble dwelling was situated, for the certified cause of death; but early sorrow and anxiety may have had to do with it, though they may not appear in the ruled pages and printed forms.

60|$|He soon, {{by these}} means, not only {{exhausted}} {{all his own}} <b>pecuniary</b> <b>resources,</b> but plunged himself enormously into debt. It was not difficult for such a man in those days to procure an almost unlimited credit for such purposes as these, for every one knew that, if he finally succeeded in placing himself, {{by means of the}} popularity thus acquired, in stations of power, he could soon indemnify himself and all others who had aided him. The peaceful merchants, and artisans, and husbandmen of the distant provinces over which he expected to rule, would yield the revenues necessary to fill the treasuries thus exhausted. Still, Caesar's expenditures were so lavish, and the debts he incurred were so enormous, that those who had not the most unbounded confidence in his capacity and his powers believed him irretrievably ruined.|$|E
6000|$|As some {{compensation}} for this second matrimonial disaster, Godfrey had soon afterwards found himself {{the object of}} fond pecuniary remembrance, {{on the part of}} one of his many admirers. A rich old lady--highly respected at the Mothers' Small-Clothes-Conversion-Society, and a great friend of Miss Clack's (to whom she left nothing but a mourning ring)--had bequeathed to the admirable and meritorious Godfrey a legacy of five thousand pounds. After receiving this handsome addition to his own modest <b>pecuniary</b> <b>resources,</b> he had been heard to say that he felt the necessity of getting a little respite from his charitable labours, and that his doctor prescribed [...] "a run on the Continent, as likely to be productive of much future benefit to his health."

60|$|After {{all it is}} a {{question}} of money, and a contest for that power and influence which money gives. At present, men have the position of the Lower House of Parliament--they have to do the harder work, but they hold the purse. Even in England there has grown up a feeling that the old law of the land gives a married man too much power over the joint <b>pecuniary</b> <b>resources</b> of him and his wife, and in America this feeling is much stronger, and the old law has been modified. Why should a married woman be able to possess nothing? And if such be the law of the land, is it worth a woman's while to marry and put herself in such a position? Those are the questions asked by the friends of the rights of women. But the young women do marry, and the men pour their earnings into their wives' laps.|$|E
60|$|It {{would be}} endless {{to point out}} the oddities and incongruities which result from this classification. Whether we take the words wealth and {{production}} in the largest, or in the most restricted sense in which they have ever yet been employed, nobody will dispute that roads, bridges, and canals, contribute in an eminent degree, and in a very direct manner, to the increase of production and wealth. The labour and <b>pecuniary</b> <b>resources</b> employed in their construction would, according to the above theory, be considered productive, if every occupier of land were compelled by law to construct so much of the road, or canal, as passes through his own farm. If, instead of this, the government makes the road, and throws it open to the public toll-free, the labour and expenditure would be, on the above system, clearly unproductive. But if the government, or an association of individuals, made the road, and imposed a toll to defray the expense, we do not see how these writers could refuse to the outlay the title of productive expenditure. It would follow, that the very same labour and expense, if given gratuitously, must be called unproductive, which, if a charge had been made for it, would have been called productive.|$|E

60|$|Like {{his younger}} brother Henry, he had {{increased}} his <b>pecuniary</b> <b>resources</b> by his own enterprise and ingenuity; with this difference, that his speculations were connected with the Arts. He had made money, in the first instance, by a weekly newspaper; and he had then invested his profits in a London theatre. This latter enterprise, admirably conducted, had been rewarded by the public with steady and liberal encouragement. Pondering over {{a new form of}} theatrical attraction for the coming winter season, Francis had determined to revive the languid public taste for the ballet by means of an entertainment of his own invention, combining dramatic interest with dancing. He was now, accordingly, in search of the best dancer (possessed of the indispensable personal attractions) who was {{to be found in the}} theatres of the Continent. Hearing from his foreign correspondents of two women who had made successful first appearances, one at Milan and one at Florence, he had arranged to visit those cities, and to judge of the merits of the dancers for himself, before he joined the bride and bridegroom. His widowed sister, having friends at Florence whom she was anxious to see, readily accompanied him. The Montbarrys remained at Paris, until it was time to present themselves at the family meeting in Venice. Henry found them still in the French capital, when he arrived from London on his way to the opening of the new hotel.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Moreton {{was better}} able to {{accomplish}} the task. He knew the Duke's mind.

Comfort and Criball. The Duke had been nervously afraid of such men of business as Comfort and Criball, and from the earliest days of his son's semi-manhood had been on his guard against them. Let any sacrifice be made so that his son might be kept clear from Comforts and Criballs. To Mr. Moreton he had been very explicit. His own <b>pecuniary</b> <b>resources</b> were so great that they could bear some ravaging without serious detriment. It was for his son's character and standing in the world, for his future respectability and dignity, that his fears were so keen, and not for his own money. By one so excitable, so fond of pleasure as Lord Silverbridge, some ravaging would probably be made. Let it be met by ready money. Such had been the Duke's instructions to his own trusted man of business, and, acting on these instructions, Mr. Moreton was able to tell the heir that the money should be forthcoming.|$|E

Controlling for both pre- and post-divorce family characteristics and unobserved heterogeneity, divorce involving young children are found to be most detrimental for child long-term educational attainments, with the effects being slightly larger for males than females. The results also suggest that family disruptions affect the edu-cational attainment of male and female children through different channels.

A special Government commission was nominated with the task to study the difficult problem of socio-economic relations in the province, owing to the growing movement of smail farmers in Split and its neighbourhood in 1908 - 1909 against the antiquated land lease system, but no importat interventions were made during the Austrian rule.

40|$|This book {{offers a}} {{critical}} analysis of consumer credit markets {{and the growth of}} outstanding debt, presenting in-depth interview material to explore the phenomenon of mass indebtedness through the life trajectories of self-identified debtors struggling with the pressures of owing money. A rich and original qualitative study of the close relationship between financial capitalism, consumer aspirations, social exclusion and the proliferation of personal indebtedness, The Dark Side of Prosperity examines questions of social identity, subjectivity and consumer motivation in close connection with the socio-cultural ideals of an ‘enjoyment society’ that binds the value of the lives of individuals to the endless acquisition and disposal of <b>pecuniary</b> <b>resources</b> and lifestyle symbols. Critically engaging with the work of Giddens, Beck and Bauman, this volume draws on the thought of contemporary philosophers including Žižek, Badiou and Rancière to consider the possibility that the expansion of outstanding consumer credit, despite its many consequences, may be integral to the construction of social identity in a radically indeterminate and increasingly divided society. A ground-breaking work of critical social research this book will appeal to scholars of social theory, contemporary philosophy and political and economic sociology, as well as those with interests in consumer credit and cultures of indebtedness.
