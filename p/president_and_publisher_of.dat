500|$|The paper {{distinguished}} {{itself in}} {{the coverage of the}} Korean War; Bigart and Marguerite Higgins, who engaged in a fierce rivalry, shared a Pulitzer Prize with Chicago Daily News correspondent Keyes Beech and three other reporters in 1951. [...] The Tribunes cultural criticism was also prominent: John Crosby's radio and television column was syndicated in 29 newspapers by 1949, and Walter Kerr began a successful three-decade career as a Broadway reviewer at the Tribune in 1951. [...] Its Paris edition, still profitable after the war, published the first columns by Art Buchwald. However, the paper's losses were continuing to mount. [...] Whitelaw Reid was gradually replaced by his brother, Ogden R. Reid, nicknamed [...] "Brown", to take charge of the paper. [...] As <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>publisher</b> <b>of</b> the paper, Brown Reid tried to interject an energy his brother lacked and reach out to new audiences. [...] In that spirit, the Tribune ran a promotion called [...] "Tangle Towns", where readers were invited to unscramble the names of jumbled up town and city names in exchange for prizes. [...] Reid also gave more prominent play to crime and entertainment stories. [...] Much of the staff, including Whitelaw Reid, felt there was too much focus on circulation {{at the expense of the}} paper's editorial standards, but the promotions initially worked, boosting its weekday circulation to over 400,000.|$|E
