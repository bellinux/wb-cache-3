"Part-time cowboy and {{full-time}} drinker" [...] Womack found gold {{float in}} 1879, which {{led him to}} digging countless <b>prospecting</b> <b>holes</b> {{in an attempt to}} find its lode, earning him the name [...] "Crazy Bob". His efforts finally paid off in 1890, when he found the El Paso lode. Winfield Scott Stratton discovered what became his Portland Mine at the site of Victor. By 1893, 10,000 miners working the district, produced one third of Colorado's gold output. Gold cyanidation was introduced in 1895, and used alongside chlorination in the mills for gold extraction. By 1895, half of Colorado's gold production of 660,000 ounces came from the district. In 1897, half a million Troy ounces of gold was produced, and in 1900, 900,000 troy ounces, two thirds of the US output. By 1920, 41 mines were active, and cumulative gold production was over 500 tons.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{progress}} report on analysis of thermal data from the Black Rock Desert of northwest Nevada. Hot springs at Soldier Meadows, Fly Ranch, Gerlach, and Pinto Mountains were mapped, and water flows and temperatures measured, by G. W. Berry and G. R. Downs in 1965 and 1966. These data have been studied further by Frank Hadsell (geophysicist) and L. T. Grose (geologist) at the Colorado School of Mines and with the computer facilities of the School of Mines Graduate Research Center, {{in an effort to}} determine geothermal power potentials. Power generation by hypothetical Carnot engines has been calculated for the four thermal areas. Data from seven <b>prospect</b> <b>holes</b> at Pinto Mountains have been exploited in plotting geothermal gradients and computing heat flows. It is emphasized that this report is to a large extent an exercise in arithmetic and thermodynamics, fraught with assumptions that may not endure. All of the conclusions are tentative. However, they consider this a valid line of practical research. To the extent that the figures and conclusions are applicable, they are generally encouraging in themselves and in comparison with those of developed geothermal areas, as to the geothermal power potential of Sun acreage in the Black Rock Desert areas...|$|R

Everywhere the earth was torn and rent as though by a Titan's struggles. Where there were no upthrown mounds of gravel, great holes and {{trenches}} yawned, and chasms where the thick rime of the earth had been peeled to bed-rock. There was no worn channel for the creek, and its waters, dammed up, diverted, flying through the air on giddy flumes, trickling into sinks and low places, and raised by huge water-wheels, were used and used again a thousand times. The hills had been stripped of their trees, and their raw sides gored and perforated by great timber-slides and <b>prospect</b> <b>holes.</b> And over all, like a monstrous race of ants, was flung an army of men--mud-covered, dirty, dishevelled men, who crawled {{in and out of the}} holes of their digging, crept like big bugs along the flumes, and toiled and sweated at the gravel-heaps which they kept in constant unrest--men, as far as the eye could see, even to the rims of the hilltops, digging, tearing, and scouring the face of nature.|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Forest Service has {{published}} {{the final version}} of regulations on the surface use of National Forest lands under the amended mining laws of 1872. These regulations became effective September 1, 1974. Although the Mining Law of 1872 is still largely intact, the new regulations place some requirements in the path of prospectors and miners operating within the boundaries of the National Forests. The Mining Law of 1872 generally gives the prospector and miner the right to enter upon the public domain, and to search for, develop, and extract a wide variety of mineral resources. The Forest Service, charged with the protection and disposition of the vegetative resources and general management of wildlife and other surface resources, has become increasingly concerned with the activities of prospectors and miners. The present regulations are aimed at better control of access roads to the mine, <b>prospect</b> <b>holes,</b> open pits, mill effluent, solid waste disposal, control of erosion and landslides, and the eventual reclamation of the site following completion of the operation. In the 49 numbered paragraphs that follow are answers to many of the questions the Forest Service anticipates will be asked by persons wanting to know about the regulations it now administers. Copies of these regulations may be obtained from the U. S. Forest Service, Portland, Oregon 97208, or from any District Ranger Station...|$|R
40|$|The work {{covers the}} <b>prospecting</b> <b>holes</b> in the {{conditions}} of the Northern Caucasus and also the vibratory systems of aerohydrodynamic and mechanical action. The aim is to analyse the driling technology indices and to substantiatedthe application fields of the face check and control aids; to investigate theoretically and experimentally the vibratory systems in the drilling tool - hole system for constructing transducers and automatic control systems of face parameters. The verivied analytical relation of the mechanical vibratory system balance x spiral with changing spiral length has been obtained. The characteristics of the different mechanical and aerodynamic frequency transducers of face parameters have been found. The conditions at which the automatic control system of the drilling fluid pressures in face keeps the stability have been determined, and the control quality parameters have been found. The automatic control system of drilling fluid pressure in face and also the automatic control system of space hole shaft position have been developed. The physical-technical effects according to the author's certificate have been entered into the data bank of the system INTELLEKT-A. The tests of 20 mock-ups of the different type face transducers protected by author's certificates have been performed.

5000|$|Pioneer Creek heads {{against the}} Baker-Minook divide, flows around {{the head of}} the Eureka, and then, at a {{distance}} of 1 - 2 mi, flows parallel to the main course of that creek. After traversing 7 - 8 mi, it joins Eureka Creek and they are said to lose themselves on Baker Flats. Pioneer Creek never carries less than three or four sluice-heads of water, and its gradient along its lower course is about 60 ft per mile. The valley's northwest side has a gentle slope running back for about a mile, and the southeast side is of almost precipitous steepness. On the gentle slope of the northwest side there are perceptibly flatter places or benches, but only one of these is persistent. This bench is traceable along Pioneer Creek for over 4 mi. Its northeast end is but little above the present level of the creek while its southwest end is about 250 ft above the creek. Over this bench and covering much of the slope below is a deposit of auriferous gravel left by the creek as it moved to the southeast. The different diggings upon it are known as [...] "bars". Five small tributaries, Doric, Boothby, Seattle Junior, Skookum, and Joe Bush, flow across this bench at right angles to the course of Pioneer Creek. Near {{the upper end of the}} bench at Joe Bush Creek, <b>prospecting</b> <b>holes</b> showed a well-defined old stream channel.|$|R
40|$|The {{algorithm}} permitting {{to solve}} the problem of finding boundary points in the given set of the points S in the d-dimensional Euclidean space E* 99 d without finding edges of the vortical shell in the set of the points S has been developed. The analysis of each point is performed by means of solving linear programming problem. The algorithm is parallelized ligthly, by means on it the localization of the point can be performed, i. e. one can be determined, the point is inner or out vortical shell of the set S and also a number of the probabilistic and statistical problems can be solved. The preliminary finding of the end points simplifies the finding of the vortical shell. The algorithm based on the introduction of the additional constructions for obtaining Voronoi diagram of the points set on the plane with limitation has been developed. The special features and novelty of this algorithm are that the boundaries of the Voronoi diagram cells of initial points set represent the vortical polygons the apex of which are contained inner polygon with beforehand known finite size. The proposed algorithm is used for solution of the problems applied for geological modelling of the properties in the oil and gas deposits and optimization of the deposit prospecting: interpolation of geological-geophysical signs; construction of maps; modelling of surfaces; optimization in arrangement of <b>prospecting</b> <b>holes.</b> The program realization has been carried out on the programming language C++.

60|$|Fortune La Pearle swore like a woman, weakly, {{with the}} hint of tears that comes of exhaustion, and plunged deeper into the maze of heaped ice, tents, and <b>prospect</b> <b>holes.</b> He {{stumbled}} over taut hawsers and piles of dunnage, tripped on crazy guy-ropes and insanely planted pegs, and fell again and again upon frozen dumps and mounds of hoarded driftwood. At times, when he deemed he had drawn clear, his head dizzy with the painful pounding of his heart and the suffocating intake of his breath, he slackened down; and ever the shadow leaped out of the gloom and forced him on in heart-breaking flight. A swift intuition lashed upon him, leaving in its trail the cold chill of superstition. The persistence of the shadow he invested with his gambler's symbolism. Silent, inexorable, not to be shaken off, he took it as the fate which waited at the last turn when chips were cashed in and gains and losses counted up. Fortune La Pearle believed in those rare, illuminating moments, when the intelligence flung from it time and space, to rise naked through eternity and read {{the facts of life}} from the open book of chance. That this was such a moment he had no doubt; and when he turned inland and sped across the snow-covered tundra he was not startled because the shadow took upon it greater definiteness and drew in closer. Oppressed with his own impotence, he halted {{in the midst of the}} white waste and whirled about. His right hand slipped from its mitten, and a revolver, at level, glistened in the pale light of the stars.|$|R
40|$|The Hungarian {{petroleum}} industry has always {{participated in the}} utilization of favourable geothermal conditions in the country. Most of the Hungarian geothermal wells were drilled by the MOL Ltd. as CH <b>prospect</b> <b>holes.</b> Accordingly, the field of geothermics belonged to the petroleum engineering, although marginally. It was therefore a surprise to hear of the decision of MOL Ltd. to build a geothermal power plant of about 2 - 5 MW. The tender was published in 2004. The site selected for the geothermal project is near the western border of an Hungarian oilfield, close to the Slovenian border. The location of the planned geothermal power plant was chosen after an analysis of suitable wells owned by the MOL Rt. The decision was made on the bases of different reservoir data. The existence of a reservoir of the necessary size, temperature, permeability, productivity and the water chemistry data was proved. The wells provide an enough information to understand {{the character of the}} reservoir and will be the production wells used by the planned power plant. The depth of the wells is about 2930 - 3200 m. The Triassic formation is reached at around 2851 m. The production and the reinjection wells are planned. The primary objective of the evaluation is to further learn the nature of the geothermal system. First a one-day discharge test is carried out. If this short-term test is successful, a six-months long-term discharge test will follow. The first period of the test is a transient phenomenon. Within the well test, the wellhead pressure, the flow rate, the outflowing water temperature, the dynamic fluid level, and the chemical components will be measured. The heat transfer around the bore-hole is influenced by the flow rate and the time. For the right appreciation of the measured data, {{it is very important to}} analyse the hea...|$|R
