While research has been focused mainly on non-neuronal cancers – for example, breast, lung and more recently pancreas and skin – tumours arising in the central nervous system, in particular in the brain, have not been studied at the NICB until recently. Malignant <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> are one of the most virulent forms of cancer.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Increased {{brain tumour}} {{incidence}} over recent decades may reflect improved diagnostic methods and clinical practice, but remain unexplained. Although estimated doses are low {{a relationship between}} radon and brain tumours may exist. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the long-term effect of exposure to residential radon on the risk of <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>tumour</b> in a prospective Danish cohort. METHODS: During 1993 - 1997 we recruited 57, 053 persons. We followed each cohort member for cancer occurrence from enrolment until 31 December 2009, identifying 121 <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>tumour</b> cases. We traced residential addresses from 1 January 1971 until 31 December 2009 and calculated radon concentrations at each address using information from central databases regarding geology and house construction. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate incidence rate-ratios (IRR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the risk of primary brain tumours associated with residential radon exposure with adjustment for age, sex, occupation, fruit and vegetable consumption and traffic-related air pollution. Effect modification by air pollution was assessed. RESULTS: Median estimated radon was 40. 5 Bq/m(3). The adjusted IRR for <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>tumour</b> associated with each 100 Bq/m(3) increment in average residential radon levels was 1. 96 (95 % CI: 1. 07; 3. 58) and this was exposure-dependently higher over the four radon exposure quartiles. This association was not modified by air pollution. CONCLUSIONS: We found significant associations and exposure-response patterns between long-term residential radon exposure radon in a general population and risk of primary brain tumours, adding new knowledge to this field.

Patients were aged between 18 – 35 years (median 27. 4 years). 5 patients had radical surgical tumour removal. 4 patients had tumour in cerebellar hemispheres and 3 in cerebellar vermis. 1 patient was irradiated with Co 60 beams (the whole neuraxis); {{the others had}} irradiation of the whole brain and boost in posterior fossa with X 6 MV up to 56 Gy and spinal cord with 18 – 24 MeV electrons. In the same time 11 children with medulloblastoma (8 boys, 3 girls) were irradiated. During this time we had 101 children with all <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> aged between 2 – 16 years (median 8. 5 years). Two of them were older then 14 years.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether the peri-tumoural choline/N-acetyl- aspartate ratio {{can be used to}} differentiate solitary primary intra-axial brain tumour and metatasis. Methods: In this retrospective study, 18 treatment-naïve adults presenting with a solitary intra-axial mass underwent conventional contrast-enhanced and proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging. The images were interpreted retrospectively by an experienced neuroradiologist and a radiology fellow with 6 years' experience. The radiologists were blinded to the clinicopathological and demographic data. The choline/N-acetyl-aspartate ratio was measured over the area of peri-tumoural oedema, which was defined by T 2 hyperintensity and non-enhancing areas immediately adjacent to the enhancing portion of the tumour. A peri-tumoural choline/N-acetyl-aspartate ratio of > 1 was classified as positive, meaning <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>tumour.</b> Statistical analysis was performed using a 2 x 2 contingency table. The interclass correlation coefficient (alpha) was calculated as the index of concordance exceeding chance for inter-rater reliability. Results: Of 18 patients, four were excluded from the study owing to absence of peri-tumoural cerebral oedema. Of the remaining 14 patients, nine had a solitary intra-axial high-grade gliomas confirmed pathologically, of whom eight had a peri-tumoural choline/N-acetyl-aspartate ratio of > 1. The remaining five patients were classified as having a solitary brain metastasis with no known primary.

40|$|Research {{examining}} psychological {{outcomes of}} people diagnosed with primary brain tumours indicates that distress is common. However, research demonstrates mixed findings {{with regards to}} those factors associated with psychological distress. This thesis explores factors that relate to psychological outcomes in this group, using the self regulation model as a specific framework for understanding the individuals' experience. In section one, a narrative review examines research pertaining {{to the experience of}} living with a <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>tumour</b> and explores the relevance of the self regulation model to this population. The review suggests a number of illness perception dimensions are linked to psychological distress, specifically, illness coherence, consequences and causal attributions. However, the review highlights that the field of psychosocial brain tumour research has yet to fully exploit the potential of the self regulation model. Section two reports findings from a quantitative study carried out using a sample of 74 adult participants from the UK who have been diagnosed with a low grade <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>tumour.</b> The relationship between the domains of the self regulation model and psychological outcomes is investigated. Other, more established variables, which have been shown to predict psychological distress, are also investigated. Findings indicate a biopsychosocial causal attribution predicts both anxiety and depression in this group. In addition, the illness perceptions variables of illness coherence and illness identity contributed to the prediction of anxiety and depression, respectively. Furthermore, cognitive difficulties were found to predict scores on all three psychological outcomes.

40|$|Background - <b>Primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> {{are rare}} among adults, but {{patients}} often experience physical, cognitive, neurological and psychosocial morbidity. Research has documented {{high rates of}} unmet supportive care needs among subgroups, such as patients receiving specific treatments or those receiving palliative care, but the needs of patients in the period soon after diagnosis are not known. Aim - To describe the unmet supportive care needs of adults recently diagnosed with <b>primary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>tumours</b> and change in needs over the early diagnosis/treatment period. Methods - A representative population-based sample of 40 patients was recruited approximately three months after diagnosis through a state cancer registry in Queensland, Australia. Patients or carer proxies completed surveys of supportive care needs in six domains (physical/daily living, psychological, patient care and support, sexuality, health system and information needs, and brain tumour-specific needs) at baseline and three months later. Mean supportive care needs scores (scale 0 - 100, with higher scores indicating higher levels of need) were calculated and compared over time. Results - The highest mean supportive care needs score {{at each time point}} was for physical needs (baseline 47. 9, SD 26. 3), closely followed by psychological needs (baseline 45. 8, SD 35. 6). Mean scores for other domains ranged from 30. 4 to 37. 9. Mean scores in all domains except for sexuality significantly declined over time, with the greatest decline for the patient care and support needs domain (mean 15. 9 point decrease).
