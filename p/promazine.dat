5000|$|One of {{the more}} unusual {{incidents}} of West's career came in August 1962, when he and two co-workers attempted to investigate the phenomenon of musth by dosing Tusko, a bull elephant at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Oklahoma City, with LSD. They expected that the drug would trigger a state similar to musth; instead, the animal began to have seizures 5 minutes after LSD administration. Beginning twenty minutes after the LSD, West and his colleagues decided to administer the antipsychotic <b>promazine</b> hydrochloride {{and a total of}} 2800 mg was injected over 11 minutes. This large <b>promazine</b> dose was not effective and may even have contributed to the animal's death, which occurred an hour and 40 minutes after the LSD was given. [...] Later, many had theories about why Tusko had died. One prominent theory was that West and his colleagues had made the mistake of scaling up the dose in proportion to the animal's body weight, rather than its brain weight, and without considering other factors, such as its metabolic rate. [...] Another theory was that while the LSD had caused Tusko distress, it was the drugs administered in an attempt to revive him that actually caused death. Attempting to prove that the LSD alone had not been the cause of death, Ronald K. Siegel of UCLA repeated a variant of West's experiment on two elephants; he administered to two elephants equivalent doses (in milligrams per kilogram) to that which had been given to Tusko, mixing the LSD in their drinking water rather than directly injecting it as had been done with Tusko. Neither elephant expired or exhibited any great distress, although both behaved strangely for a number of hours.|$|E

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have thrown light on the {{metabolism}} of the phenothiazine “tran-quilizers, ” especially chlorpromazine and pro-mazine. Urinary excretion {{of some of the}} metabolites of <b>promazine</b> (unchanged <b>promazine,</b> <b>promazine</b> sulfoxide, monomethylpromazine and monomethylpromazine sulfoxide) has now been quantified in dogs (Walkenstein and Seifter, 1959). Goldenberg and Fishman (1961) report that they can detect about 24 metabolites of chlorpromazine by paper chromatography. They have quantified several of the metabolites (un-changed chlorpromazine, chlorpromazine sulf-oxide and two demethylated chlorpromazine sulfoxides) in both dog and human urine. The sum of the metabolites for each of the drugs, however, still totals only 5 to 10 % of the admin-istered dose. Evidence has been obtained for the formation of phenolic glucuronide metabolites of chlorpromazine (Lin et al., 1959; Posner, 1959) and <b>promazine</b> (Posner, 1959).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{identify}} human cytochrome P- 450 isoforms (CYPs) involved in 5 -sulphoxidation and N-demethylation of the simplest phenothiazine neuroleptic <b>promazine</b> in human liver. The experiments were performed in the following in vitro models: (A) a study of <b>promazine</b> metabolism in liver microsomes—(a) correlations between the rate of <b>promazine</b> metabolism and the level and activity of CYPs; (b) the effect of specific inhibitors on the rate of <b>promazine</b> metabolism (inhibitors: CYP 1 A 2 —furafylline, CYP 2 D 6 —quinidine, CYP 2 A 6 +CYP 2 E 1 —diethyldithiocarbamic acid, CYP 2 C 9 —sulfaphenazole, CYP 2 C 19 —ticlopidine, CYP 3 A 4 —ketoconazole); (B) <b>promazine</b> biotransformation by cDNA-expressed human CYPs (Supersomes 1 A 1, 1 A 2, 2 A 6, 2 B 6, 2 C 9, 2 C 19, 2 E 1, 3 A 4); (C) <b>promazine</b> metabolism in a primary culture of human hepatocytes treated with specific inducers (rifampicin—CYP 3 A 4, CYP 2 B 6 and CYP 2 C inducer, 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlordibenzeno-p-dioxin (TCDD) —CYP 1 A 1 / 1 A 2 inducer). In human liver microsomes, the formation of <b>promazine</b> 5 -sulphoxide and N-desmethylpromazine was significantly correlated with the level of CYP 1 A 2 and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase and acetanilide 4 -hydroxylase activities, as well as with the level of CYP 3 A 4 and cyclosporin A oxidase activity. Moreover, the formation of N-desmethylpromazine was correlated well with S-mephenytoin 4 ′-hydroxylation. Furafylline (a CYP 1 A 2 inhibitor) and ketoconazole (a CYP 3 A 4 inhibitor) significantly decreased the rate of <b>promazine</b> 5 -sulphoxidation, while furafylline and ticlopidine (a CYP 2 C 19 inhibitor) significantly decreased the rate of <b>promazine</b> N-demethylation in human liver microsomes. The cDNA-expressed human CYPs generated different amounts of <b>promazine</b> metabolites, but the rates of CYP isoforms to catalyse <b>promazine</b> metabolism at therapeutic concentration (10 μM) was as follows: 1 A 1 > 2 B 6 > 1 A 2 > 2 C 9 > 3 A 4 > 2 E 1 > 2 A 6 > 2 D 6 > 2 C 19 for 5 -sulphoxidation and 2 C 19 > 2 B 6 > 1 A 1 > 1 A 2 > 2 D 6 > 3 A 4 > 2 C 9 > 2 E 1 > 2 A 6 for N-demethylation. The highest intrinsic clearance (Vmax/Km) was found for CYP 1 A subfamily, CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 2 B 6 in the case of 5 – sulphoxidation, and for CYP 2 C 19, CYP 1 A subfamily and CYP 2 B 6 in the case of N-demethylation. In a primary culture of human hepatocytes, TCDD (a CYP 1 A subfamily inducer), as well as rifampicin (mainly a CYP 3 A 4 inducer) induced the formation of <b>promazine</b> 5 -sulphoxide and N-desmethylpromazine. Regarding the relative expression of various CYPs in human liver, the obtained results indicate that CYP 1 A 2 and CYP 3 A 4 are the main isoforms responsible for 5 -sulphoxidation, while CYP 1 A 2 and CYP 2 C 19 are the basic isoforms that catalyse N-demethylation of <b>promazine</b> in human liver. Of the other isoforms studied, CYP 2 C 9 and CYP 3 A 4 contribute to a lesser degree to <b>promazine</b> 5 -sulphoxidation and N-demethylation, respectively.

40|$|Abstract-The {{clinically}} important phenothiazine drugs, particularly chlorpromazine, often elicit phototoxic and photoallergic reactions. We {{have used}} the spin traps 2 -methyl- 2 -nitrosopropane (MNP) and 5,s-dimethyl-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) to define the radical photolysis pathways of chlorpromazine and <b>promazine.</b> In the absence of oxygen the dechlorination product of chlorpromazine is trapped by MNP.

This effect is interpreted as being the result of a stimulation of DA autoreceptors, mediating a decrease of dopaminergic activity in the central nervous system. The use of apomorphine as an EEG activating agent is suggested...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} certain drugs on {{metabolism}} of ammonia by {{the liver and}} kidneys in dogs were investigated by a technique in which both hepatic inflow and outflow bloods could be repeatedly sampled in unanesthetized healthy animals. Specific representatives of the classes of the drugs studied included thiopental (barbiturates), morphine (opiates and analgesics), <b>promazine</b> (tranquillizers), and chlorothiazide (oral diuretics) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the influence of classic and atypical neuroleptics on the activity of rat CYP 2 C 6 measured as a rate of warfarin 7 -hydroxylation. The reaction was studied in control liver microsomes in the presence of neuroleptics, as well as in microsomes of rats treated intraperitoneally for one day or two weeks (twice a day) with pharmacological doses (mg/kg) of the drugs (<b>promazine,</b> levomepromazine, thioridazine, perazine 10, chlorpromazine, haloperidol 0. 3, risperidone 0. 1, sertindole 0. 05), in the absence of the neuroleptics in vitro. Some of the neuroleptics added in vitro to control liver microsomes decreased the activity of CYP 2 C 6. Sertindole and levomepromazine (KE = 25 and 31 µM, respectively) were the most potent inhibitors of the rat CYP 2 C 6 among the drugs studied. Their effects were more pronounced than those of the other phenothiazines tested: thioridazine and chlorpromazine (K E = 88 and 91 µM, respectively), <b>promazine</b> and perazine (...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} elderly {{patients}} undergoing intraocular surgery were premedicated {{with a combination}} of <b>promazine</b> 50 mg. and meperidine 50 mg. Superior sedation and a smoother postoperative course were noted as compared to a control group premedicated with the usual high dosages of opiates and barbiturates. The incidence of nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, and postoperative disorientation was less than 20 %. Hypotension was not a problem...|$|E
