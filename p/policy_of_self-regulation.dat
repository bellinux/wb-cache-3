40|$|The <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation,</b> {{which is}} central to {{occupational}} safety and health law in the United. Kingdom, is reviewed {{in the context of the}} catering industry. The influence of service and service quality on selfregulation and safety climate is considered. Some previously unpublished fiudings from a larger study on the factors affecting safety behaviour in lecturer chefs are reported and examined in terms of the above. It is suggested that the traditional autonomy and autocracy of chefs in catering organisations give them a pivotal role in self-regulation. In addition, the pursuit of service quality influences the chefs in certain ways, some of which may be negative in terms of safety management. It is argued that the pivotal role of chefs in delivering service quality can potentially adversely affect his or her role in safety management. Finally, it is proposed that the conflict between safety and production in the service industries may be more acute than in manufacturing because of the need for worker and, more particularly. supervisor concurrence rather than mere compliance with service quality strategies...|$|E
40|$|An {{emerging}} {{feature of}} the modern regulatory state in Britain and elsewhere is the promotion <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation.</b> This paper examines {{the relationship between the}} state and self-regulation {{in the context of the}} challenge of meeting public interest objectives. It draws on research on the <b>policy</b> and practice <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation</b> in recent years in Britain. The paper argues that the institutions, processes and mechanisms of the modern regulatory state and the ‘better regulation’ agenda in Britain, notably those that aim to foster transparency and accountability, can assist in the achievement of public interest objectives in self-regulatory schemes. We conclude that a ‘new regulatory paradigm’ can be put forward which involves a form of regulatory ‘subsidiarity’, whereby the achievement of regulatory outcomes can be delegated downwards to the regulated organizations and self-regulatory bodies while being offset by increasing public regulatory oversight based on systems of accountability and transparency...|$|R
40|$|In {{the vast}} {{majority}} of jurisdictions in the United States, a business may protect its confidential information and customer goodwill by conditioning employment on an employee’s acceptance of a covenant not to compete. These covenants are beneficial to the marketplace because they allow employers to provide employees with necessary skills, knowledge, and proprietary information without any fear of misappropriation. Accordingly, noncompete agreements are upheld by courts so long as they pass a fact-specific “reasonableness” test. Notwithstanding the widespread acceptance of reasonable noncompete agreements for all other professionals—including doctors and corporate executives—forty-eight states, following the American Bar Association’s lead, prohibit all noncompete agreements among lawyers. This prohibition is purportedly designed to protect both an attorney’s professional autonomy and a client’s right to choose his counsel. Despite legal commentators’ criticism of the prohibition, several state bar associations have recently extended it beyond the traditional law-firm context to agreements between companies and their in-house counsel. This expansion has transformed a questionable <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> professional <b>self-regulation</b> into an unjustifiable infringement on the legitimate interests of corporate employers. In addition to providing an analysis of the history and ethical norms that justify rejection of the ban’s application to in-house counsel, this Note argues that bar committees that issue opinions supporting the ban’s extension may be susceptible to antitrust liability under the Supreme Court’s new Dental Board standard pertaining to state-action immunity...|$|R

We can frequently observe the symptoms of institutionalisation in these groups of children and adolescents, which is a major obstacle to their functional <b>self-regulation</b> <b>of</b> behaviour and to their return to the natural social environment. The research sample was comprised of 2, 776 children and adolescents from the natural and institutional environment in the Czech Republic (children and adolescents living in total institutions such as correctional institutions for children and minors and children's homes). The Self-regulation Questionnaire (SRQ) used in the study contained 12 items aimed at 3 areas <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation</b> <b>of</b> behaviour: Affect, Awareness and Empowerment. The results have shown that the level <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation</b> <b>of</b> behaviour is lower among children in the institutional environment. We recorded the most significant differences between children from the institutional and natural environment in the area of Affect (i. e. the regulation of emotions). It means that children and adolescents from institutional environments have more trouble controlling their emotions than children from a natural environment. We also found that the level <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation</b> <b>of</b> behaviour is dependent on the perceived level of problematic behaviour of children and adolescents. A higher level of problematic behaviour of children and adolescents indicates a lower level <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation</b> <b>of</b> their behaviour. We also found that differences in the level <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation</b> <b>of</b> behaviour, depending on the perceived degree of problematic behaviour, are not significant in either type of environment.

The demand for safe and effective dietary supplement in the US market has grown exponentially and consumers, the government, and the media, which has been a major force in the market, have each begun to seriously question the quality of dietary supplements. Given the consumer-driven nature of the dietary supplements industry and the regulatory framework in the US, the quality control standards for botanical products are still found lacking and/or unevenly implemented, despite major gains achieved by the industry as the private sector seeks to improve quality and meet governmental expectations under the current <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> largely <b>self-regulation.</b> While major accomplishments continue to be achieved by industry to ensure improved quality of the product including packaging, GMP issues, improved labeling clarity, the addition of product expiration dates and claims, and more, for those standardized botanical extracts, many problems still remain.

Latent factors derived from self-regulation task performance during the three childhood age periods were robust and stable over time, indicating that individuals’ rank-order <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation</b> was largely consistent across childhood. Adolescent measures were more problematic. Self-regulation during early and middle childhood differentially predicted adolescent adjustment. Early childhood self-regulation was related to positive attitudes toward school, and aggressive and antisocial behavior a decade later. Self-regulation in middle childhood, on the other hand, predicted academic achievement in adolescence. Very early indicators <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation</b> predicted both adaptive and maladaptive adjustment. Early childhood self-regulation explained unique variance in positive attitudes towards school and aggressive and antisocial behavior, beyond what was explained by self-regulation at later points in development. However, early childhood self-regulation was highly correlated with background characteristics. After accounting for the direct effect of gender, ethnicity, school readiness, and family income on adjustment, early childhood self-regulation did not explain additional variance in adolescent outcomes. Thus, individual variability in early self-regulation is meaningful for predicting later adjustment, but not more so than background characteristics that likely contribute to a child’s preparedness as he/she transitions to formal schooling. Findings illustrate the cascading effect <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation</b> skills from early childhood through adolescence, while also identifying the relative impact <b>of</b> <b>self-regulation</b> across development for predicting adolescent adjustment. Results highlight the importance of early childhood, as early self-regulation lays the foundation for later self-regulation skills, and ultimately, for successful functioning...|$|R
