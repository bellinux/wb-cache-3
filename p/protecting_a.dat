5|$|As {{part of this}} scheme, in 1283 Edward {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of new castles and walled towns across the occupied territories, in part to encourage substantial migration to the region from England. Amongst these were the future World Heritage sites of Caernarfon Castle and its walled town, overlooking the River Seiont; Conwy Castle and its walled town, controlling a crossing point over the River Conwy; and Harlech Castle, <b>protecting</b> <b>a</b> sea port and newly established English town. Plans were probably made to establish a castle and walled settlement near the strategically important town of Llanfaes on Anglesey – the future Beaumaris – but were postponed due to the costs of the other projects.|$|E

The ponies share a hug before remembering that Ponyville is still under Discord's influence.|$|E
5|$|In {{nineteenth century}} China, Jungle Village {{is home to}} several warring clans. The village {{blacksmith}} creates deadly weapons for the clans, intending to use his payments to purchase the freedom of his lover Lady Silk, and leave the village. The region's governor tasks the Lion Clan's leader, Gold Lion, with <b>protecting</b> <b>a</b> large shipment of gold that must pass through the village. Gold is betrayed by his lieutenants Silver Lion and Bronze Lion, who plan to steal the gold. They use the chaos ensuing from a fight with the Hyena Clan to allow their co-conspirator Poison Dagger—the governor's aide—to assassinate Gold, after which Silver becomes the Lions' leader. Gold's son Zen-Yi learns of his father's murder and sets off to the village to seek revenge.|$|E

5|$|In the {{earliest}} {{stage of the}} revolt, in the early summer, al-Hajj Muhammad's fighters primarily operated in the Wadi al-Sha'ir area between Nablus and the coastal plain. Most of their actions consisted of attacks against British Army and police patrols between Tulkarm and Nablus. On 21 June in the Battle of Anabta, al-Hajj Muhammad and his fasa'il ambushed a British Army force <b>protecting</b> <b>a</b> Jewish convoy passing near the village. Three British bomber planes were dispatched to aid the ambushed convoy. The ensuing battle lasted about seven hours and ended with the deaths of ~10 rebels and 2 British soldiers. A further 21 rebels and two British soldiers were wounded. The authorities consequently issued an arrest warrant for al-Hajj Muhammad.|$|E
5|$|It is {{one thing}} to say that a bird has a {{property}} right in its nest, or that a wolf has a property right in its den – specific bits of territory used exclusively by one animal family. But the habitat that animals need to survive extends far beyond such specific and exclusive bits of territory – animals often need to fly or roam over vast territories shared by many other animals. <b>Protecting</b> <b>a</b> bird’s nest is of little help if the nearby watering holes are polluted, or if tall buildings block its flight path. It’s not clear how ideas of property rights can help here.|$|E
5|$|On the {{defensive}} line, defensive tackle Jonathan Lewis {{was considered a}} key player. Though limited by a cast <b>protecting</b> <b>a</b> broken pinky finger suffered during Virginia Tech's game against Virginia, Lewis was expected to continue to perform well. Heading into the Sugar Bowl, Lewis had 38tackles, including 10tackles for loss and foursacks.

5|$|The Castle Doctrine {{incorporates}} {{elements of}} puzzle, strategy, stealth, and roguelike games, viewed from a 2D perspective. It focuses on maintaining and <b>protecting</b> <b>a</b> vault of money stored in one's house from intruders. These intruders are actually other {{players of the}} game; likewise, the player can invade others' houses and steal their money—presented in a list rather than found through exploration—in the same way. This list shows a pre-determined three-name pseudonym of each player, the number of dollars contained in their vault, how many others have tried to rob it, and how many {{have died in the}} process. All deaths in the game are permanent; upon dying, the player must create a new character.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Calais was {{the first}} cable ship port in Europe and is the fourth largest port in France and the largest for {{passenger}} traffic. The port {{accounts for more than}} a third of economic activity of the town of Calais. Cargo traffic has tripled over the past two decades. In 2007 more than 41.5 million tonnes of traffic passed through Calais with some 11.52 million passengers, 1.4 million trucks and trailers, 2.249 million cars and 4,700 crossings a year. On average, ships sail from the port every 30 minutes. A new 400 million euro project is underway at the port to create a breakwater <b>protecting</b> <b>a</b> pool of 700 meters long, thus allowing virtually all types of ships to stop at Calais.|$|E
5|$|The keep was {{surrounded}} by a curtain wall with probably four flanking towers and a fortified gatehouse <b>protecting</b> <b>a</b> relatively small bailey; these outer defences, rather than the keep, probably represented the main defences of the castle. The marshes nearby were drained turning the village of Orford into a sheltered port. The castle, including the surrounding ditch, palisade and stone bridge, cost £1,413 to build, with the work possibly being conducted by the master mason Alnoth. Some of the timbers were brought {{from as far away as}} Scarborough, and the detailed stonework being carved from limestone from Caen in Normandy, the remainder of the stone being variously from local mudstone and coralline, as well as limestone from Northamptonshire.|$|E

5|$|A fresh wave of {{concerns}} about France followed in the 1880s, accompanied {{by the introduction of}} still more powerful naval artillery and fast warships and torpedo boats, resulting in a fresh wave of modernisation. An electronically-operated minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885, jointly controlled from St Mawes and Pendennis. New, quick-firing guns were installed at Hurst to enable the castle to engage the newer vessels. Calshot was brought back into service as a coastal fort, with a new battery of quick-firing guns <b>protecting</b> <b>a</b> boom across the estuary. The original 16th-century parts of fortifications such as Southsea and Calshot were too small and unsuitable for modern weapons, however, and were instead used for mounting searchlights, range and direction finding; in some cases their fabric was left to slowly decline.|$|E
5|$|As {{a student}} at Carnegie Mellon University in 2004, Druckmann was tasked with {{creating}} a video game concept to present to film director George A. Romero, who would select a winner. Druckmann's idea was to merge the gameplay of Ico (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968), with a lead character similar to John Hartigan from Sin City (1991–2000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with <b>protecting</b> <b>a</b> young girl; however, due to the lead character's heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. Though the idea did not win, Druckmann later developed it when creating the story of The Last of Us. An early idea for the game was that the infection only spread to women, though this was later deemed misogynistic.|$|E

5|$|At de Launay's request, an {{additional}} force of 32 {{soldiers from the}} Swiss Salis-Samade regiment {{had been assigned to}} the Bastille on 7 July, adding to the existing 82 invalides pensioners who formed the regular garrison. De Launay had taken various precautions, raising the drawbridge in the Comté tower and destroying the stone abutment that linked the Bastille to its bastion to prevent anyone from gaining access from that side of the fortress. The shops in the entranceway to the Bastille had been closed and the gates locked. The Bastille was defended by 30 small artillery pieces, but nonetheless, by 14 July de Launay was very concerned about the Bastille's situation. The Bastille, already hugely unpopular with the revolutionary crowds, was now the only remaining royalist stronghold in central Paris, in addition to which he was <b>protecting</b> <b>a</b> recently arrived stock of 250 barrels of valuable gunpowder. To make matters worse, the Bastille had only two days' supply of food and no source of water, making it impossible to withstand a long siege.|$|E
5|$|Ramsay's request {{arrived at}} RAF Kenley. Two {{experienced}} pilots, Group Captain Francis Victor Beamish (10 victories) and Wing Commander Finlay Boyd (14 victories), were sent on patrol to investigate. Flying over the channel in Spitfires, {{they ran into}} large numbers of Bf 109s <b>protecting</b> <b>a</b> large fleet of warships and dived away. Holding radio silence they kept their discovery until they landed. They sighted the ships at 10:42 and landed at 11:09. It was another 16 minutes before Bomber Command was alerted and Ramsay {{did not know of}} the situation until 11:30. Soon afterwards, at around 12:16 GMT, the first naval actions began between escorting Schnellboots and British Motor Torpedo Boats (MTBs) and the British were alerted. Galland ordered all low flying to cease and allowed Max Ibel and his team aboard Scharnhorst to break radio silence. Ibel then began directing Fw 190 and Bf 109s toward RAF units heading to the area. As luck would have it, as the first outnumbered British units entered the airspace over the ships, the German vessels were now at their closest point to German airfields. It allowed the Luftwaffe to offer maximum protection.|$|E
5|$|The first {{defensive}} walls at Worcester {{were built}} after the Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43. Although a settlement existed {{on the site}} during the Iron Age, {{there is no evidence}} that walls were ever built around it. The Roman town was probably preceded by the construction a Roman fort, both located on the south side of the modern city and protected by the River Severn to the west. There are relatively few historical details or archaeological evidence from this period, but archaeological investigations of the Roman town walls suggest that it had wooden ramparts and was protected by an 89-foot (27 m) wide ditch. As with other Roman towns, the walls would have enclosed a rectangular town, <b>protecting</b> <b>a</b> settlement with a grid-like network of streets.|$|E
