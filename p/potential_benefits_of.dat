5|$|Following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, {{which ended}} {{the war on}} the Eastern Front between Imperial Russia and Imperial Germany, {{the main focus of}} the Ottoman Army turned to the Anatolian provinces and territories lost in 1877–1878 during the Russo-Turkish War. The Ottoman Army {{embarked}} on a series of territorial conquests in the Caucasus beginning in northern Persia. Erzerum which had been captured by the Russians in 1916, was retaken on 24 March 1918, followed by Van on 5 April and later Batum, Kars and Tiflis. Reoccupation of these former possessions brought little strategic advantage to the Ottoman Empire, compared with the <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> military success in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Among sharks, the porbeagle's {{capacity}} for elevating body temperature {{is second only}} to the salmon shark's. Its red muscles are located deep within the body, adjacent to the spine, and its lateral rete is composed of over 4,000 small arteries arranged in bands. It {{has one of the highest}} core temperatures within its family, 8–10°C (14–18°F) warmer than that of the surrounding water. Being warm-bodied may allow this shark to maintain higher cruising speeds, hunt in deep water for extended periods of time, and/or enter higher latitudes during winter to exploit food resources not available to other sharks. The orbital retia of the porbeagle can raise the temperature of its brain and eyes by 3–6°C (5–11°F), and likely serve to buffer those sensitive organs against the large temperature shifts that accompany changes in depth; <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> this include increased visual acuity and reduced response times.|$|E
5|$|The {{focus of}} the Ottoman Army's war effort in 1918 turned from Palestine to Anatolia, to the provinces and territories lost by their empire between 1877 and 1878 during the Russo-Turkish War. This change of {{direction}} was heavily influenced by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, signed in March 1918 which ended the war on the Eastern Front between Imperial Russia and the Central Powers. As a result, the Ottoman Army embarked {{on a series of}} territorial conquests in the Caucasus. Erzerum, which had been captured by the Russians during the Erzerum Offensive in 1916, was retaken on 24 March 1918, followed by Van on 5 April and later Batum, Kars and Tiflis. The reoccupation of these former Ottoman possessions, however, brought little strategic advantage, compared with the <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> military success in Palestine.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} that the native blue crab in eastern North America, Callinectes sapidus, is able to control populations of C.maenas; numbers of the two species are negatively correlated, and C.maenas is not found in the Chesapeake Bay, where Callinectes sapidus is most frequent. On the west coast of North America, C.maenas appears to be limited to upper estuarine habitats, in part because of predation by native rock crabs (Romaleon antennarium and Cancer productus) and competition for shelter with a native shore crab, Hemigrapsus oregonensis. Host specificity testing has recently been conducted on Sacculina carcini, a parasitic barnacle, as a potential biological control agent of C.maenas. In the laboratory, Sacculina settled on, infected, and killed native California crabs, including the Dungeness crab, Metacarcinus magister (formerly Cancer magister), and the shore crabs Hemigrapsus nudus, Hemigrapsus oregonensis and Pachygrapsus crassipes. Dungeness crabs were the most vulnerable of the tested native species to settlement and infection by the parasite. Although Sacculina did not mature in any of the native crabs, developing reproductive sacs were observed inside a few Metacarcinus magister and Hemigrapsus oregonensis. Any <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> using Sacculina to control C.maenas on the west coast of North America would need to be weighed against these potential non-target impacts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} a {{consensus}} {{in the scientific community}} about how it was possible for the brain's neural circuitry to change through experience, the potential effect of web technologies on the brain's neural circuitry was unknown. On the topic of the Internet's effect on reading skills, Guinevere F. Eden, director of the Center for the Study of Learning at Georgetown University, remarked that the question was whether or not the Internet changed the brain {{in a way that was}} beneficial to an individual. Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited the <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> computer software that specifically targets learning disabilities, stating that among some neuroscientists {{there was a}} belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving receptive language disorders. Olds mentioned neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and the elderly. In 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called Fast ForWord that offered seven brain exercises that improved language impairments and learning disabilities in children. Feedback on Fast ForWord showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected spillover effect that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of Fast ForWord specifically designed for autism. At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, Fast ForWord-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of sharpening the brains of elderly people by retaining the plasticity of their brains.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 1925, Roosevelt {{spent most}} of his time in the Southern United States on his houseboat, the Larooco. Intrigued by the <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> hydrotherapy, he {{established}} a rehabilitation center at Warm Springs, Georgia, in 1926. To create the rehabilitation center, Roosevelt assembled a staff of physical therapists and used most of his inheritance to purchase the Merriweather Inn.

In December 2013, ten days after Judge Leon's ruling, Judge William H. Pauley III came to the {{opposite}} conclusion. In ACLU v. Clapper, although acknowledging that privacy concerns are not trivial, Pauley found that the <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> surveillance outweigh these considerations and ruled that the NSA's collection of phone data is legal.|$|E
25|$|Education held special {{significance}} for a socialist of Wilson's generation, {{in view of}} its role in both opening up opportunities for children from working-class backgrounds and enabling Britain to seize the <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> scientific advances. Under the first Wilson government, {{for the first time}} in British history, more money was allocated to education than to defence. Wilson continued the rapid creation of new universities, in line with the recommendations of the Robbins Report, a bipartisan policy already in train when Labour took power.|$|E
25|$|In SCNT, {{not all of}} {{the donor}} cell's genetic {{information}} is transferred, as the donor cell's mitochondria that contain their own mitochondrial DNA are left behind. The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg. As a consequence, clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus. This fact may also hamper the <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> SCNT derived tissues/organs for therapy, as there may be an immunoresponse to the non-self mtDNA after transplant.|$|E

30|$|Introduction: Despite {{advances}} in post-resuscitation care, cardiac arrest mortality remains high, {{mainly because of}} severe neurological injury. Recently, clinical studies have reported a <b>potential</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> permissive hypercapnia following cardiac arrest on survival and neurological outcome.|$|R
25|$|Prostate cancer {{screening}} is controversial. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing increases cancer detection {{but does not}} decrease mortality. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening using the PSA test, due {{to the risk of}} overdiagnosis and overtreatment, as most cancer diagnosed would remain asymptomatic. The USPSTF concludes that the <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> testing do not outweigh the expected harms. While 5α-reductase inhibitors appear to decrease low-grade cancer risk they do not affect high-grade cancer risk and thus are not recommended for prevention. Supplementation with vitamins or minerals does not appear to affect the risk.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of water stress {{is an area}} of continuing research in viticulture. Of particular focus is the connection between yield size and the <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> water stress. Since the act of stressing the vine does contribute to reduce photosynthesis-and by extension, reduce ripening since the sugars produced by photosynthesis is needed for grape development-it is possible that a stressed vine with high yields will only produce lots of under ripe grapes. Another interest of study is the potential impact on white grape varieties with enologists and viticulturists such as Cornelius Van Leeuwen and Catherine Peyrot Des Gachons contending that white grape varieties lose some of their aromatic qualities when subjugated to even mild forms of water stress.|$|E
25|$|These {{materials}} were {{very difficult for}} others to copy or otherwise reproduce, and many included information that was essential to completing the game. Seeing the <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> both aiding game-play immersion and providing a measure of creative copy-protection, in addition to acting {{as a deterrent to}} software piracy, Infocom and later other companies began creating feelies for numerous titles. In 1987, Infocom released a special version of the first three Zork titles together with plot-specific coins and other trinkets. This concept would be expanded as time went on, such that later game feelies would contain passwords, coded instructions, page numbers, or other information that would be required to successfully complete the game.|$|E

25|$|During his 2002 campaign, Romney {{had said}} he backed age-appropriate, {{comprehensive}} sex education in public schools. In 2005, against {{the will of the}} state legislature, he introduced federally funded abstinence-only education programs developed by a subsidiary of a Christian anti-abortion organization into some public schools. Romney said that adoption of the programs would be voluntary for individual school districts and that the programs would supplement rather than replace existing comprehensive sex education curricula. Opponents argued that funding pressure would lead to schools dropping comprehensive sex education programs for the freely available abstinence-only ones, which under federal law were required to teach that any sexual activity outside of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects, and which were prohibited from discussing the <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> contraception.|$|E
25|$|The Somali {{diaspora}} is inter-connected via {{information exchange}} and informal money transfer systems. Somalis in the UK operates various business networks, with the Somaliland Chamber of Commerce having an office locally. Another Somali business network, the Midlands Somali Business Association, a non-profit organisation centered in Birmingham, offers commercial advice to Somali businesses {{based in the}} city. It also publishes a quarterly newsletter and runs workshops and conferences for the local Somali business community. Additionally, the number of Somali businesses in the UK is increasing, ranging from restaurants, remittance companies, hairdressing salons and travel agencies to, especially, internet cafés. Although some of these businesses cater to mainstream British society, most are aimed at a Somali clientele. However, the Midlands Somali Business Association has recognised the <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> penetrating the larger British business community, and is encouraging stakeholders to tap into this sector. The organisation is also exploring opportunities for transnational businesses.|$|E
25|$|Human {{epidemiology}} {{is used as}} a {{basis for}} risk estimation for cancer, acute radiation risks, and cataracts. This approach is not viable for estimating CNS risks from space radiation, however. At doses above a few Gy, detrimental CNS changes occur in humans who are treated with radiation (e.g., gamma rays and protons) for cancer. Treatment doses of 50 Gy are typical, which is well above the exposures in space even if a large SPE were to occur. Thus, of the four categories of space radiation risks (cancer, CNS, degenerative, and acute radiation syndromes), the CNS risk relies most extensively on experimental data with animals for its evidence base. Understanding and mitigating CNS risks requires a vigorous research program that will draw on the basic understanding that is gained from cellular and animal models, and on the development of approaches to extrapolate risks and the <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> countermeasures for astronauts.|$|E
