A cross-sectional study of pesticide handling practices and self-perceived symptoms of acute pesticide poisoning was conducted using questionnaire-based interviews with 89 pesticide sprayers in Boeung Cheung Ek (BCE) Lake, Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The study showed that 50 % of the pesticides used belonged to WHO class I + II and personal protection among the farmers were inadequate. A majority of the farmers (88 %) had experienced symptoms of acute pesticide poisoning, and this was significantly associated with the number of hours spent spraying with OPs/CMs (OR = 1. 14, CI 95 %: 1. 02 – 1. 28). The higher educated farmers reduced their risk of poisoning by 55 % for each extra <b>personal</b> <b>protective</b> <b>measure</b> they adapted (OR = 0. 45, CI 95 %: 0. 22 – 0. 91). These findings suggest that improving safe pesticide management practices among the farmers and enforcing the effective banning of the most toxic pesticides will considerably reduce the number of acute pesticide poisoning episodes...|$|E

Clear dose response relationships were established with the highest dose of 10 % tuber extract evoking 100 % repellency. Percent protection obtained against An. culicifacies Giles species A 100 % repellency in 4 hours, 6 hours, An. stephensi 100 % repellency in 6 hours and Cx. quinquefasciatus was 100 % repellency in 6 hours at the 10 % concentration. Against DEET- 2. 5 % An. culicifacies A 100 % repellency in 1 hour, 2 hours, 6 hours, An. stephensi have shown 100 % repellency in 6 hours, and Culex quinquefasciatus have shown 100 % repellency in 1 hour, 2 hours, 6 hours. The consolidated data of the repellency observed in different species is given and it is evident that the over all repellency rates varied between 80 and 100 % for different repellents concentrations (2. 5 %, 5 %, and 10 %).

40|$|Abstract Background Malaria {{remains the}} most {{important}} public health problem in tropical and subtropical areas. Mothers' or caregivers' ability to recognize childhood malaria-related morbidity is crucial as knowledge, attitudes and health seeking behavior of caregivers towards childhood malaria could influence response to signs of the disease. Methods A total of 1, 003 caregivers in 'at-risk' villages {{in close proximity to}} the Gilgel-Gibe hydroelectric dam in south-western Ethiopia, and 953 caregivers in 'control' villages further away from the dam were surveyed using structured questionnaires to assess their knowledge, perceptions and health seeking behaviour about childhood malaria. Results Malaria (busa) was ranked as the most serious health problem. Caregivers perceived childhood malaria as a preventable ('at-risk' 96 %, 'control' 86 %) and treatable ('at-risk' 98 % and 'control' 96 %) disease. Most caregivers correctly associated the typical clinical manifestations with malaria attacks. The use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) was mentioned as a <b>personal</b> <b>protective</b> <b>measure,</b> whereas the role of indoor residual spraying (IRS) in malaria prevention and control was under-recognized. Most of the caregivers would prefer to seek treatment in health-care services in the event of malaria and reported the use of recommended anti-malarials. Conclusion Health education to improve knowledge, perceptions and health-seeking behaviour related to malaria is equally important for caregivers in 'at risk' villages and caregivers in 'control' villages as minimal differences seen between both groups. Concluding, there may be a need of more than one generation after the introduction of the dam before differences can be noticed. Secondly, differences in prevalence between 'control' and 'at-risk' villages may not be sufficient to influence knowledge and behaviour. </p...|$|E
40|$|Summer-weight {{clothing}} articles impregnated with permethrin {{are available}} as a <b>personal</b> <b>protective</b> <b>measure</b> against human-biting ticks in the United States. However, very few studies have addressed the impact of contact with summer-weight permethrin-treated textiles on tick vigor and behavior. Our aim was to generate new knowledge of how permethrin-treated textiles impact nymphal Ixodes scapularis ticks, the primary vectors in the eastern United States of the causative agents of Lyme disease, human anaplasmosis, and human babesiosis. We developed a series of bioassays designed to: (i) clarify whether permethrin-treated textiles impact ticks through non-contact spatial repellency or contact irritancy; (ii) evaluate the ability of ticks to remain in contact with vertically oriented permethrin-treated textiles, mimicking contact with treated clothing on arms or legs; and (iii) determine the impact of timed exposure to permethrin-treated textiles {{on the ability of}} ticks to move and orient toward a human finger stimulus, thus demonstrating normal behavior. Our results indicate that permethrin-treated textiles provide minimal non-contact spatial repellency but strong contact irritancy against ticks, manifesting as a "hot-foot" effect and resulting in ticks actively dislodging from contact with vertically oriented treated textile. Preliminary data suggest that the contact irritancy hot-foot response may be weaker for field-collected nymphs as compared with laboratory-reared nymphs placed upon permethrin-treated textile. We also demonstrate that contact with permethrin-treated textiles negatively impacts the vigor and behavior of nymphal ticks for > 24 h, with outcomes ranging from complete lack of movement to impaired movement and unwillingness of ticks displaying normal movement to ascend onto a human finger. The protective effect of summer-weight permethrin-treated clothing against tick bites merits further study.

30|$|Mosquito bites {{can give}} an {{unpleasant}} feeling and may transmit the vector disease such as dengue or malaria to humankind. Mosquitoes {{are attracted to}} human blood containing protein to develop their eggs, biting human to another human, thereby transmitting the vector disease to human. The genus Aedes mosquitoes are responsible to transmit the vector of dengue all over the worlds with billion people suffer from the disease and also death cases reported (Division of Vector-Borne Disease 2012). There {{are only a few}} vaccines to treat the virus caused by mosquito bites, however, in the case of dengue, researchers are yet to find the vaccines for it (Farag et al. 2011) the best way is for people to avoid mosquito bites. Repellents are practical products and economical means to prevent the transmissions of the mosquito vector disease (Yang and Ma 2005). Hence, <b>personal</b> <b>protective</b> <b>measure</b> must be taken to protect human from mosquito bites. Applying mosquito repellents either on their skin, house, even on their clothing or upholsteries may help in protecting human against mosquito bites. Repellents that applied to skin or clothing produce a vapor layer that has an offensive smell or taste and makes a person unattractive for feeding and therefore repels the mosquito (Brown and Hebert 1997; Fradin and Day 2002) several studies showed that most repellents was developed in the form of lotions, cream, essential oils, spray, or solution where in most cases require direct application to the human skin (Amer and Mehlhorn 2006; Ariffin et al. 2012; Fei and Xin 2007; Fradin and Day 2002; Snodgrass 1992; Yates et al. 2005). Treating the garment fabrics with repellent agent is another way to avoid mosquito bites as the big proportion of the human skin is covered by the treated garment thus, avoiding it to be exposed to the blood sucking mosquitoes. Imparting the mosquito repellents onto the textile and cloth impregnating laundry emulsions application is one of the innovatory and practical approach in daily routine to driving away the blood sucking arthropods from people (Brown and Hebert 1997; Maheshwari and Ramya 2014). The present inventions of mosquito repellents to be imparted into the fabric can be produced using various techniques such as addition during rinse cycle, direct coating, finishing like cloth impregnating laudry emulsions and others (Anitha et al. 2011; Anuar and Yusof 2016; Farag et al. 2011; Fei and Xin 2007; Snodgrass 1992; Sumithra and Vasugi Raja 2012; Troutman 2009; Van Winkle 2002). The textiles with mosquito repelling features exhibit a character that can drive the mosquito away from the treated textile, or by knocking down the mosquitoes when it is in contact with the treated textiles. The applications of the mosquito repellent feature must not damage the original characteristic of the textile materials itself. The value added of repellent properties also for textile material is a novel approaches as it by means can help to reduce the statistics of vector disease cases without giving a side effect to the wearer. According to a study by (Stajkovic and Milutinovic 2013), the recommendation regarding usage of repellent product for textile materials is “the product should be applied in a thin layer on the skin surface, clothing or both, it should not be applied under clothing”.|$|E

We describe the current knowledge of tick-borne rickettsioses {{as they relate}} to international travel, their microbiological diagnosis, treatment, possible prevention, and future prospects. Methods: Literature-based review and personal observations. Results: During the last decade, some 400 cases of tick-borne rickettsioses have been reported in international travellers, the vast majority being African tick bite fever caused by Rickettsia africae and Mediterranean spotted fever caused by Rickettsia conorii. Only a minority of infected travellers can recall a preceding tick bite. Most patients present with a mild-to-moderately severe flu-like illness typically accompanied by a cutaneous rash and an inoculation eschar {{at the site of the}} tick bite, but potentially life-threatening disease with disseminated vaculitis is occasionally seen. Definite microbiological confirmation of tick-borne rickettsioses by isolation or antigen detection is only available at reference laboratories and diagnosis must in most cases rely on clinical and epidemiological data supported by serology. Doxycycline is the recommended treatment for tick-borne rickettsioses and prevention is based on <b>personal</b> <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> against tick bites when travelling in endemic areas.

50|$|Vector control measures, {{especially}} mosquito control, {{are essential}} to reducing the transmission of disease by arboviruses. Habitat control involves draining swamps and removal of other pools of stagnant water (such as old tires, large outdoor potted plants, empty cans, etc.) that often serve as breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Insecticides can be applied in rural and urban areas, inside houses and other buildings, or in outdoor environments. They are often quite effective for controlling arthropod populations, though use {{of some of these}} chemicals is controversial, and some organophosphates and organochlorides (such as DDT) have been banned in many countries. Infertile male mosquitoes have been introduced in some areas {{in order to reduce the}} breeding rate of relevant mosquito species. Larvicides are also used worldwide in mosquito abatement programs. Temefos is a common mosquito larvicide.People can also reduce the risk of getting bitten by arthropods by employing <b>personal</b> <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> such as sleeping under mosquito nets, wearing protective clothing, applying insect repellents such as permethrin and DEET to clothing and exposed skin, and (where possible) avoiding areas known to harbor high arthropod populations. Arboviral encephalitis can be prevented in two major ways: <b>personal</b> <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> and public health measures to reduce the population of infected mosquitoes. Personal measures include reducing time outdoors particularly in early evening hours, wearing long pants and long sleeved shirts and applying mosquito repellent to exposed skin areas.

Use of protective clothing was 40 % effective; routine use of tick repellents on skin or clothing was 20 % effective. Checking one’s body for ticks and spraying property with acaricides were not effective. We concluded that use of protective clothing and of tick repellents (on skin or clothing) are effective in preventing LD...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Bicycles {{are used}} for transportation, {{exercise}} and recreation. In this study we aimed to investigate the epidemiological, clinical and economic aspects of bicycle injuries. Material and Method: We {{included in the study}} who admitted to the Emergency Department with a bicycle accident between January 2008 and July 2012. Patient age and sex, accident pattern, presence of <b>personal</b> <b>protective</b> <b>measures,</b> injured body part, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, Revised Trauma Score (RTS), radiological findings, requested consultations, duration of hospital stay, season of injury, and average cost rates were recorded. The study population was divided into 2 age groups as 0 - 14 years and over 14 years. Results: A patients were 238 (81. 2 %) male and their mean age was 31. 5 ± 14. 1 years. Fifty-five (18. 8 %) patients were female and their mean age was 34. 5 ± 15. 9 years. Males had significantly higher rate of bicycle injury (...|$|R
40|$|Even if an {{effective}} vaccine against Ebola virus disease (EVD) becomes available, the challenges posed by this disease are complex. Certain socioeconomic and cultural {{factors have been}} linked to recent outbreaks of EVD in West Africa. The outbreaks revealed widespread ignorance by laypersons of EVD etiology, mode of transmission, and <b>personal</b> <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> that can be taken. Lack of trust in the authorities, virus infection during the preparation of “bushmeat” for human consumption, traditional funerary practices, and relatively free flow of goods and people between regions and across international borders may have facilitated the spread of EVD and hindered outbreak control efforts. Inadequacy in health systems of the most seriously affected countries, such as Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, is also an important factor. The objectives of this article are to argue that EVD should be evaluated in a systematic and holistic manner and that this can be done through the use of the modified Haddon Matrix...|$|R
40|$|Doxycycline {{probably}} {{remains the}} malaria chemoprophylaxis of choice prescribed for Australians visiting multiple drug resistant malarious areas. Over the past 10 years, {{there has been}} a marked drop in the prescription of less useful antifolate drugs, such as pyrimethamine combination antimalarial drugs, as well as chloroquine, with a rise in prescription of mefloquine and proguanil. Newer drugs, such as Malarone® and tafenoquine may displace these antimalarials in the future, particularly in the prevention of P. falciparum infection. The issuing of updated guidelines for malaria chemoprophylaxis has probably been the most effective means of influencing the prescription of antimalarials, particularly with the reduction in the use of antifolate drugs. Continuing medical education, compliance with the national travel medicine guidelines and regulation of antimalarial use, especially through restricted access and withdrawal from the market, may be useful in maintaining appropriate prescription of antimalarial drugs. Where appropriate, advice concerning <b>personal</b> <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> against malaria and other vector-borne diseases should continue to be given...|$|R
50|$|Currently, {{there is}} no vaccine for WNV. The best method to reduce the rates of WNV {{infection}} is mosquito control {{on the part of}} municipalities, businesses and individual citizens to reduce breeding populations of mosquitoes in public, commercial and private areas via various means including eliminating standing pools of water where mosquitoes breed, such as in old tires, buckets, sagging gutters, and unused swimming pools. On an individual basis, the use of <b>personal</b> <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> to avoid being bitten by an infected mosquito, via the use of mosquito repellent, window screens, avoiding areas where mosquitoes are more prone to congregate, such as near marshes, and areas with heavy vegetation, and being more vigilant from dusk to dawn when mosquitoes are most active offers the best defense. In the event of being bitten by an infected mosquito, familiarity of the symptoms of WNV on the part of laypersons, physicians and allied health professions affords the best chance of receiving timely medical treatment, which may aid in reducing associated possible complications and also appropriate palliative care.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{investigate}} whether Australian soldiers {{were exposed to}} filarial parasites that cause lymphatic filariasis during a 6 -month deployment to Timor-Leste, antifilarial antibody levels were measured in 907 soldiers using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Initial testing using Dirofilaria immitis antigen demonstrated that 49 of 907 (5. 4 %) soldiers developed antifilarial antibodies of the IgG 1 subclass after deployment, whereas 1 of 944 (0. 1 %) seroconverted to the IgG 4 subclass. When a sub sample of 88 D. immitis-reactive sera was subject to testing with an antifilarial antibody test using Brugia malayi antigen, 46 had elevated IgG antibodies, whereas 5 had elevated antibodies of the IgG 4 subclass. A total of 24 soldiers seroconverted to B. malayi, as measured by parasite-specific IgG, whereas 1 seroconverted to IgG 4. The relatively low number of seroconversions indicates a low but measurable risk of exposure to human filarial parasites among Australian soldiers deployed to Timor-Leste. However, {{to reduce the risk}} of exposure to these parasites, soldiers deploying to endemic areas should practice strict adherence to <b>personal</b> <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> against mosquito bites...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundJapanese {{encephalitis}} (JE) {{virus is}} the leading vaccine-preventable cause of encephalitis in Asia. Although the risk for JE for most travelers to Asia is low, it varies based on the destination, season, trip duration, and activities. MethodsWe present case reports for three US adults who were infected with JE virus while traveling or residing in Asia. ResultsAmong the three JE cases, one case had a 10 -day trip to mainland China and participated in outdoor activities in a rural area, a second case had been resident in Taiwan for 4 months, and a third, fatal case was an expatriate living in South Korea. ConclusionsJE {{should be considered in}} the differential diagnosis for any patient with an acute neurologic infection who recently has been in a JE-endemic country. Health-care providers should assess the itineraries of travelers to JE-endemic countries, provide guidance on <b>personal</b> <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> to prevent vector-borne diseases, and consider recommending JE vaccine for travelers at increased risk for JE virus infection.

40|$|Arboviruses {{present an}} ongoing {{challenge}} to Oceanic nations. Viruses including Ross River, Barmah Forest and Murray Valley encephalitis are endemic {{to the region}} and are responsible for occasional outbreaks. Recent epidemics of chikungunya, Zika and dengue viruses across many nations demonstrate the vulnerability of this region to globally emergent arboviruses. In addition to global disease trends, the emergence of these viruses is largely driven by human influences such as water and waste management, air travel and land use. Limited public health resources and infrastructure, dispersed populations and the complexity of arbovirus ecologies complicate mitigation and management strategies in the Western Pacific. A regional collaborative approach augments the surveillance and response capability of individual nations, but the challenge of managing arbovirus risk with limited resources remains. In the absence of specific disease treatments and feasible vaccination solutions, mosquito control and <b>personal</b> <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> are the mainstay of management programmes, albeit with variable success. In the long term, the development and integration of novel surveillance, diagnostic and mosquito control technologies will improve the capacity to prevent and respond to arbovirus threats...|$|R
