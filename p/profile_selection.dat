40|$|This study uses three {{periods of}} {{airborne}} laser scanning (ALS) {{digital elevation model}} (DEM) data to analyze the short-term erosional features of the Tsaoling landslide triggered by the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan. Two methods for calculating the bedrock incision rate, the equal-interval cross section selection method and the continuous swath <b>profiles</b> <b>selection</b> method, {{were used in the}} study after nearly ten years of gully incision following the earthquake-triggered dip-slope landslide. Multi-temporal gully incision rates were obtained using the continuous swath <b>profiles</b> <b>selection</b> method, which is considered a practical and convenient approach in terrain change studies. After error estimation and comparison of the multi-period ALS DEMs, the terrain change in different periods can be directly calculated, reducing time-consuming fieldwork such as installation of erosion pins and measurement of topographic cross sections on site. The gully bedrock incision rate calculated by the three periods of ALS DEMs {{on the surface of the}} Tsaoling landslide ranged from 0. 23 m/year to 3. 98 m/year. The local gully incision rate in the lower part of the landslide surface was found to be remarkably faster than that of the other regions, suggesting that the fast incision of the toe area possibly contributes to the occurrence of repeated landslides in the Tsaoling area...|$|R

5000|$|A new {{approach}} to vocationalization of secondary schooling has been introduced {{within the framework of}} general educational reform.

Vocationalization in the Russian Federation refers to the introduction of profile education at the upper-secondary level (the last two years of schooling, grades 10 and 11) and the process of preparation for <b>profile</b> <b>selection.</b> Profile education provided students with the opportunity to study a chosen area in depth, usually one that would be related to their further study (TVET or academic). Schools could design their own profiles, e.g science, socio-economics, humanities, and technology, or keep a general orientation curriculum.

In order to provide data with high bit-rates and maintain performance {{as close as possible}} to traditional networks, the 3 GPP (The 3 rd Generation Partnership Project) worked on a high performance standard for mobile called Long Term Evolution (LTE).
