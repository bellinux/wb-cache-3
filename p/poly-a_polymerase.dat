25|$|As Pol II {{reaches the}} end of a gene, two protein {{complexes}} carried by the CTD, CPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor) and CSTF (cleavage stimulation factor), recognize the poly-A signal in the transcribed RNA. Poly-A-bound CPSF and CSTF recruit other proteins to carry out RNA cleavage and then polyadenylation. <b>Poly-A</b> <b>polymerase</b> adds approximately 200 adenines to the cleaved 3’ end of the RNA without a template.

2500|$|Pathway {{preference}} {{may differ}} between organisms, as well. [...] While human cells utilize both short- and long-patch BER, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was long thought to lack a short-patch pathway {{because it does}} not have homologs of several mammalian short-patch proteins, including pol β, DNA ligase III, XRCC1, and the kinase domain of PNKP. [...] The recent discovery that the <b>poly-A</b> <b>polymerase</b> Trf4 possesses 5' dRP lyase activity has challenged this view.|$|E
50|$|Chandipura {{virus is}} an enveloped RNA virus with an {{approximate}} genome length of ~11 kb. Viral genome codes for five polypeptides, namely, Nucleocapsid protein N, Phosphoprotein P, Matrix protein M, Glycoprotein G and Large protein L in five monocistronic mRNAs. N protein encapsidates genome RNA into a nuclease-resistant form to protect in from cellular RNAse function. L and P protein together forms viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase; where catalytic functions for RNA polymerization, Capping and <b>Poly-A</b> <b>polymerase</b> resides within the L protein and P {{acts as a}} transcriptional activator. Matrix protein glues the encapsidated genome RNA, also known as nucleocapsid, with the outer membrane envelop. G protein spikes out of the membrane and acts as a major antigenic determinant.|$|E
5000|$|As Pol II {{reaches the}} end of a gene, two protein {{complexes}} carried by the CTD, CPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor) and CSTF (cleavage stimulation factor), recognize the poly-A signal in the transcribed RNA. Poly-A-bound CPSF and CSTF recruit other proteins to carry out RNA cleavage and then polyadenylation. <b>Poly-A</b> <b>polymerase</b> adds approximately 200 adenines to the cleaved 3’ end of the RNA without a template. The long poly-A tail is unique to transcripts made by Pol II. In the process of terminating transcription by Pol I and Pol II, the elongation complex does not dissolve immediately after the RNA is cleaved. The polymerase continues to move along the template, generating a second RNA molecule associated with the elongation complex. Two models have been proposed to explain how termination is achieved at last. [...] The allosteric model states that when transcription proceeds through the termination sequence, it causes disassembly of elongation factors and/or an assembly of termination factors that cause conformational changes of the elongation complex. [...] The torpedo model suggests that a 5' to 3' exonuclease degrades the second RNA as it emerges from the elongation complex. Polymerase is released as the highly processive exonuclease overtakes it. It is proposed that an emerging view will express a merge of these two models.|$|E
40|$|SummaryRNA import into {{mammalian}} mitochondria {{is considered}} essential for replication, transcription, and {{translation of the}} mitochondrial genome but the pathway(s) and factors that control this import are poorly understood. Previously, we localized polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPASE), a 3 ′ → 5 ′ exoribonuclease and <b>poly-A</b> <b>polymerase,</b> in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, a location lacking resident RNAs. Here, we show a new role for PNPASE in regulating the import of nuclear-encoded RNAs into the mitochondrial matrix. PNPASE reduction impaired mitochondrial RNA processing and polycistronic transcripts accumulated. Augmented import of RNase P, 5 S rRNA, and MRP RNAs depended on PNPASE expression and PNPASE–imported RNA interactions were identified. PNPASE RNA processing and import activities were separable and a mitochondrial RNA targeting signal was isolated that enabled RNA import in a PNPASE-dependent manner. Combined, these data strongly support an unanticipated role for PNPASE in mediating the translocation of RNAs into mitochondria...|$|E
40|$|We {{performed}} whole {{genome sequencing}} of a cidofovir {[(S) - 1 -(3 -hydroxy- 2 -phosphonylmethoxy-propyl) cytosine] [HPMPC]}-resistant (CDV-R) strain of Monkeypoxvirus (MPV). Whole-genome {{comparison with the}} wild-type (WT) strain revealed 55 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one tandem-repeat contraction. Over one-third of all identified SNPs were located within genes comprising the poxvirus replication complex, including the DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase, mRNA capping methyltransferase, DNA processivity factor, and <b>poly-A</b> <b>polymerase.</b> Four polymorphic sites were found within the DNA polymerase gene. DNA polymerase mutations observed at positions 314 and 684 in MPV were consistent with CDV-R loci previously identified in Vaccinia virus (VACV). These data suggest the mechanism of CDV resistance may be highly conserved across Orthopoxvirus (OPV) species. SNPs were also identified within virulence genes such as the A-type inclusion protein, serine protease inhibitor-like protein SPI- 3, Schlafen ATPase and thymidylate kinase, among others. Aberrant chain extension induced by CDV may lead to diverse alterations in gene expression and viral replication that may result in both adaptive and attenuating mutations. Defining the potential contribution of substitutions in the replication complex and RNA processing machinery reported here may yield further insight into CDV resistance and may augment current therapeutic development strategies...|$|E
40|$|RNA {{processing}} and turnover {{plays an important}} role in RNA maturation, metabolism and quality control, which contribute to gene regulation and cell health. The TRAMP complex, composed of an RNA binding protein Air 2 p, a <b>poly-A</b> <b>polymerase</b> Trf 4 p, and a RNA helicase Mtr 4 p, assist nuclear exosome-dependent RNA {{processing and}} degradation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, like tRNAiMet turnover, 52 ̆ 7 ETS degradation and rRNA processing. Mtr 4 p structure reveals a novel protruding arch domain, which contains the recognizable KOW domain and a stalk domain. Except for the two conserved RecA-like helicase domains, the helicase core contains two other structural domains, a winged helix that connects arch to the core and a ratchet domain of unknown function. The role of how structural domains assist Mtr 4 p function remains unclear. In this study, I created a library of Mtr 4 p structural domain mutants that were defective in tRNAiMet turnover. KOW domain mutations K 700 N, P 731 S, S 672 N and P 802 S, winged helix mutation K 904 N, and ratchet domain mutation R 1030 G were characterized in cells and biochemically. Mtr 4 - 904 p and Mtr 4 - 1030 p showed significant defects in tRNAiMet turnover in vivo, while the arch domain mutants didn 2 ̆ 7 t cause detectable growth phenotypes. Consistently, Mtr 4 - 904 p and Mtr 4 - 1030 p exhibited decreased in vitro unwinding activities. However, the modest unwinding defect of K 700 N was not reflected in cell. It suggests that structural domains in helicase core are more essential for Mtr 4 p function than that of the arch domain. KOW domain and ratchet domain contributed to RNA binding activities of Mtr 4 p in vitro. Winged helix mutant K 904 N had modest effects on RNA binding in vitro, but showed greater effects on protein stability. Structural domain mutants affected ATPase activities. K 700 N and R 1030 G mutations reduced Mtr 4 p ATP affinity. Overall, the results revealed that residues in structural domains affect Mtr 4 p enzymatic activities from different aspects. In addition, I showed that single-stranded RNA is a preferred substrate for Mtr 4 p binding, and activates higher enzymatic activity of Mtr 4 p. My results also demonstrate that, as a helicase, Mtr 4 p is able to modulate the balance between unwinding and re-annealing in a concentration and ATP dependent manner...|$|E
