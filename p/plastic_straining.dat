These materials feature 40 – 60 vol. pct reinforcement homogeneously distributed in a pore-free matrix. Their tensile behaviour is studied {{as a function of}} reinforcement size and shape. Internal damage, in the form of particle fracture and matrix voiding, occurs from the onset of <b>plastic</b> <b>straining.</b> Its evolution with strain is monitored through changes in (i) stiffness and (ii) peak stress after incremental <b>plastic</b> <b>straining</b> and annealing. The influence of damage on the flow curves of the composites can be accounted for using basic postulates of continuum damage mechanics. Failure strains vary between 2 and 4 %, and are a function of the rate of damage accumulation.

Calculations are per-formed with the finite element software CAST 3 M, using a polycrystalline mesh where the individual grains are modeled as cubes, having random crystallographic orientations. At the grain scale, the constitutive law parameters are adjusted using single crystal cyclic stress strain curves (CSSCs) from literature. Calculations are performed for different loadingconditions (uniaxial tension-compression, biaxial tension-compression and alternated torsion) {{and a large}} range of three remote <b>plastic</b> <b>strain</b> amplitudes. We obtained 3 close macroscopic CSSCs. Somewhat lower stresses are obtained in torsion, particularly at high <b>plastic</b> <b>strain</b> amplitude.

High variability in fatigue life was observed, and abnormally short lifetimes were systematically observed {{to be due to}} crack initiation at (sub) -surface non-metallic inclusions. However, crack initiation within (sub) -surface non-metallic inclusions did not necessarily lead to short fatigue life. The macro- to micro-mechanical mechanisms of deformation and damage have been examined by means of detailed microstructural characterization, tensile and fatigue mechanical tests, and in situ tensile testing. The initial stages of crack micro-propagation from cracked non-metallic particles into the surrounding metallic matrix occupies a large fraction of the fatigue life and requires extensive local <b>plastic</b> <b>straining</b> in the matrix adjacent to the cracked inclusions.
