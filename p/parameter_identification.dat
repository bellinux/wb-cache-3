40|$|Electronic {{throttle}} control (ETC) system has {{worked its way}} to becoming a standard subsystem in most of the current automobiles as it has contributed much to the improvement of fuel economy, emissions, drivability and safety. Precision control of the subsystem, which consists of a dc motor driving a throttle plate, a pre-loaded return spring and a set of gear train to regulate airflow into the engine, seems rather straightforward and yet complex. The difficulties lie in the unknown system parameters, hard nonlinearity of the pre-loaded spring that pulls the throttle plate to its default position, and friction, among others. In this paper, we extend our previous results obtained for the modeling, unknown system <b>parameters</b> <b>identification</b> and control of a commercially available Bosch’s DV-E 5 ETC system.
