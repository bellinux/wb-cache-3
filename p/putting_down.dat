5|$|With {{the goal}} of <b>putting</b> <b>down</b> Bengali nationalism, the Pakistan Army {{launched}} Operation Searchlight on 25 March 1971. According to Eric Heinze the Pakistani forces targeted both Hindus and Bengali-speaking Muslims. In the ensuing 1971 Bangladesh genocide, the army caused the deaths of up to 3million people, created up to 10million refugees who fled to India, and displaced a further 30million within East Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the primary}} {{role of the}} British Army was to protect the colonies against {{external}} attack, no actual threat ever materialised. The British Army was instead used in policing, guarding convicts at penal institutions, combating bushranging, <b>putting</b> <b>down</b> convict rebellions—as occurred at Bathurst in 1830—and to suppress Aboriginal resistance to the extension of European settlement. Notably British soldiers {{were involved in the}} battle at the Eureka Stockade in 1854 on the Victorian goldfields. Members of British regiments stationed in Australia also saw action in India, Afghanistan, New Zealand and the Sudan.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} game round, the first to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> a card is {{the winner of the}} first bid, next is the player to his left, and so on. In the {{subsequent}} rounds, the winner of the previous round plays first.

5|$|Führer Begleitbattalion ("Führer Escort Battalion"; FBB) was a {{military}} protection unit set up just before war began. It had the task of protecting Hitler's military headquarters and accompanying him when visiting battlefronts. It also was responsible for all luggage that travelled with Hitler and his staff. It was originally commanded by then infantry colonel Erwin Rommel.

Notable amongst the early operations of the Company's forces were the defence of the city from Mughal and Maratha invaders and from the incursions of the Nawab of Carnatic.

5|$|The Greek city-states of Athens and Eretria had {{supported}} the unsuccessful Ionian Revolt against the Persian Empire of Darius I in 499–494BC. The Persian Empire was still relatively young {{and prone to}} revolts by its subject peoples. Moreover, Darius was an usurper and had to spend considerable time <b>putting</b> <b>down</b> revolts against his rule. The Ionian Revolt threatened the integrity of his empire, and he thus vowed to punish those involved (especially those not already part of the empire). Darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece.|$|E

One hundred Indian auxiliaries were also sent, with one thousand native porters. Further supplies were forthcoming from the embattled residents of San Miguel.

Eventually, all 20 men of the patrol returned to the UN lines, but a third of them were wounded. Bleak was credited with saving the patrol, both by promptly treating the wounded and by aggressively attacking and killing or neutralizing five Chinese soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Concord resumed her patrol {{on station}} in August 1898, but {{returned}} to the Philippines on 19 December to assist in <b>putting</b> <b>down</b> the insurrection. Her duty consisted of patrolling the coast to restrict insurgent movements and shipping; bombarding various strongholds; and aiding United States Army operations. Except for a voyage to Guam in March 1900 to deliver stores, and a brief voyage to Hong Kong for repairs, Concord remained in Philippine waters until June 1901, when she sailed by way of Alaskan waters to San Francisco, arriving 28 September 1901. She cruised with the Fleet in Mexican waters, then went out of commission on 26 February 1902 at Mare Island.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to lack of}} needed equipment, the Smurfs don't {{manage to}} put out the fire of a bench, so they decide to organise as firemen in case of a really serious fire. Tailor Smurf makes the uniforms, while Handy Smurf builds both a pump vehicle and an alarm bell. Papa Smurf {{installs}} a weather vane he claims is magical. The firemen take their task very seriously: they <b>put</b> <b>down</b> a chimney fire (destroying a house in the process), they <b>put</b> <b>down</b> the fire of Handy Smurf's forge, they <b>put</b> <b>down</b> the fire of Papa Smurf's just-lit candle, and they even <b>put</b> <b>down</b> Poet Smurf's poem to the Smurfette because it claims his love is a flame. However, they cannot <b>put</b> <b>down</b> a barbecue fire because it's just outside the Smurf Village, so it's beyond their surveillance. Gargamel smells the barbecue and tries to follow it to the village, but he fails and, in anger, puts the forest in fire. While the firemen Smurfs try to <b>put</b> the fire <b>down,</b> Papa Smurf uses the magic weather vane to make wind that sends the fire towards Gargamel, and then some rain to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> the fire. A Smurf asks Papa Smurf who gave him the magic weather vane, and he answers it was a certain Aeolus.|$|R
5|$|For a time, Arsaces {{consolidated}} {{his position}} in Parthia and Hyrcania {{by taking advantage of}} the invasion of Seleucid territory in the west by Ptolemy III Euergetes (r.246–222BC) of Egypt. This conflict with Ptolemy, the Third Syrian War (246–241BC), also allowed Diodotus I to rebel and form the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom in Central Asia. The latter's successor, Diodotus II, formed an alliance with Arsaces against the Seleucids, but Arsaces was temporarily driven from Parthia by the forces of Seleucus II Callinicus (r.246–225BC). After spending some time in exile among the nomadic Apasiacae tribe, Arsaces led a counterattack and recaptured Parthia. Seleucus II's successor, Antiochus III the Great (r.222–187BC), was unable to immediately retaliate because his troops were engaged in <b>putting</b> <b>down</b> the rebellion of Molon in Media.|$|E
5|$|Frakes {{believes}} that the main themes of First Contact—and Star Trek as a whole—are loyalty, friendship, honesty and mutual respect. This {{is evident in the}} film when Picard chooses to rescue Data rather than evacuate the ship {{with the rest of the}} crew. The film makes a direct comparison between Picard's hatred of the Borg and refusal to destroy the Enterprise and that of Captain Ahab in Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick. The moment marks a turning point in the film as Picard changes his mind, symbolized by his <b>putting</b> <b>down</b> his gun. A similar Moby-Dick reference was made in , and although Braga and Moore did not want to repeat it, they decided it worked so well they could not leave it out.|$|E

A year later, returning from the Sejm and from the engagement ceremony with Gryzelda, he gathered a 4,000 strong division that participated in <b>putting</b> <b>down</b> of the Ostrzanin Uprising and arrived at the region affected by the unrest in June that year. Together with Hetman Potocki he defeated the insurgents at the Battle of Żownin, which turned into a rather difficult siege of the Cossack camp that lasted from 13 June till the Cossack relief forces were defeated on 4 August, and the Cossacks capitulated on 7 August.|$|E

60|$|But, indeed, the dictum {{that truth}} always triumphs over persecution, {{is one of}} those {{pleasant}} falsehoods which men repeat after one another till they pass into commonplaces, but which all experience refutes. History teems with instances of truth <b>put</b> <b>down</b> by persecution. If not suppressed for ever, it may be thrown back for centuries. To speak only of religious opinions: the Reformation broke out at least twenty times before Luther, and was <b>put</b> <b>down.</b> Arnold of Brescia was <b>put</b> <b>down.</b> Fra Dolcino was <b>put</b> <b>down.</b> Savonarola was <b>put</b> <b>down.</b> The Albigeois were <b>put</b> <b>down.</b> The Vaudois were <b>put</b> <b>down.</b> The Lollards were <b>put</b> <b>down.</b> The Hussites were <b>put</b> <b>down.</b> Even after the era of Luther, wherever persecution was persisted in, it was successful. In Spain, Italy, Flanders, the Austrian empire, Protestantism was rooted out; and, most likely, would have been so in England, had Queen Mary lived, or Queen Elizabeth died. Persecution has always succeeded, save where the heretics were too strong a party to be effectually persecuted. No reasonable person can doubt that Christianity might have been extirpated in the Roman Empire. It spread, and became predominant, because the persecutions were only occasional, lasting but a short time, and separated by long intervals of almost undisturbed propagandism. It is a piece of idle sentimentality that truth, merely as truth, has any inherent power denied to error, of prevailing against the dungeon and the stake. Men are not more zealous for truth than they often are for error, and a sufficient application of legal or even of social penalties will generally succeed in stopping the propagation of either. The real advantage which truth has, consists in this, that when an opinion is true, it may be extinguished once, twice, or many times, but in the course of ages there will generally be found persons to rediscover it, until some one of its reappearances falls on a time when from favourable circumstances it escapes persecution until it has made such head as to withstand all subsequent attempts to suppress it.|$|R
