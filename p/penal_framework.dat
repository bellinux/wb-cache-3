40|$|This article {{examines}} the cultural significance of some new ’signs and symbols ’ of punishment {{that are to be}} found taking place (albeit in uneven measure) across English-based jurisdictions at the present time. What I want to suggest is that these developments may be pointers to {{the emergence of a new}} penal culture, which makes possible a set of arrangements and strategies that are different from those which had been in the forefront of the modernist <b>penal</b> <b>framework.</b> Some of the values on which this structure had been founded, particularly during the welfare era of the 20 th century, bear correspondence to trends seen by Norbert Elias (1939; 1982) as central to the ’civilizing ’ of modern Western societies. For him, the ’civilizing ’ process was not a naturally occurring phenomenon, but a social construction based on contingent historical developments- which at any time could be thrown into a ’decivilizing’ reverse by such phenomena as war, natural disaster and economic collapse (Garland, 1990). Under such circumstances, there is likely to be a resurrection of practices and behaviour from different cultural eras (Mennell, 1990). This theoretical framework will be used here to analyse current penal trends and their implications...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the legal rules governing the time limits of application of criminal legislation in adjudicating international crimes before {{the courts in}} Bosnia and Herzegovina. The author points out {{to the existence of}} two different criminal law regimes which are used against the criminal offenders: the first one is used by the courts of the B&H Entities and the Brčko District, where these rules are applied consistently and the criminal offenders are awarded prison sentences within the <b>penal</b> <b>framework</b> envisaged in earlier criminal codes, including the so-called interim laws; the second one is applied by the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina which, in compliance with the B&H Criminal Code of 2003, may award long-term imprisonment of up to 45 years for the commission of these criminal offences even though this penalty did not exist in the B&H criminal law at the time when the acts were committed. In particular, the paper focuses on the legal issue arising from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) judgment in Maktouf and Damjanovic vs. Bosnia and Herzegovina (18 July 2013), where the Court established a violation of Article 7, paragraph 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The author {{discusses the}} common standpoint that the judgment removed all misunderstandings concerning the application of these rules; considering that such conception is unjustified, the author identifies a number of other outstanding problems which occurred in the application of these rules after rendering the above judgment. The author specifically considered the criminal provision on Crimes against Humanity as envisaged in Article 172 of the B&H Criminal Code, which the B&H Court regards as a new criminal offence which is envisaged in Article 7, paragraph 2 of the ECHR. The author believes that such application of this criminal offence is unjustified. Upon providing an analysis of the elements of crime constituting the legal nature of this criminal offence, the author concludes {{that it is not a}} completely new criminal offence; for this reason, it may not be subject to this provision, i. e. the punishment shall not be imposed by relying on the basis of general principles of international law...|$|E

40|$|The legal {{regime of}} contraventions, {{along with the}} <b>penal</b> {{normative}} <b>framework</b> represents for the law enforcement agencies, the main tools for ensuring, maintaining and restoring law and order. The lawframework in contravention matters in Romania, the Government Ordinance No. 2. July 12 th 2001 on the legal regime of contraventions, with all subsequent amendments, {{are now in a}} situation where they are not longer able to cover the practical needs of the domain, lacking the activity efficiency of different assertingagents. Thus, on the one hand, the asserting and punishing activities of contraventions lead to spending important human and financial resources, and it does not have the purpose provided by law, on the other hand, this situation determines an unduly large load on the court with complaints against the contravention report and the multiplication of cases solved by the courts through admission judgments of complaints and the annulment of contravention asserting reports and the appliance of contravention sanctions. Also, in caseswhen the contravention sanctions remain final and enforceable, their simply record "in flow" is not likely to correct the offender, the standing evidence being the increasing number of imposed fines, which are marked on local public administration records as unfulfilled. Replacing the laws relating to contravention imprisonment with the provision of community service activities were not likely to lead offenders to refrain from committing such acts, or to pay voluntarily the imposed fines, whereas according to the current regulatory provision of an activity of community service cannot be put into repossession. In conclusion, we consider necessary the intervention as urgent as possible of the legislator to correct, supplement and improve the contravention normative framework which leads us to several proposals...|$|R
