40|$|Under the {{compressed}} wage structure and generous family policies, Nordic {{countries have been}} regarded as leaders of gender equality in terms of low gender <b>pay</b> <b>gaps</b> and high rates of female labor force participation; after the fundamental restructuring of the economic system in Eastern European countries, women have experienced a remarkable change {{with respect to the}} labor market positions and economic status facing the increased wage inequality and significant declines in labor force participation rates. The cross-country comparison of gender <b>pay</b> <b>gaps</b> is investigated using ESS 2 (European Social Survey second round) data sets and econometric techniques for the selected Nordic countries and Eastern European countries. The results indicate the different characteristics in terms of the gender <b>pay</b> <b>gaps</b> and labor market situations in these countries. Some significant difference in gender <b>pay</b> <b>gaps</b> between countries has been found; however, the systematic pattern of significant difference in gender <b>pay</b> <b>gaps</b> between the two groups of countries does not exist. Besides, the negative correlation between gender wage gaps and female employment rates cannot be strongly supported by the evidence in this study and the positive relation between the wage distributions and the gender wage gaps can only be applied to the adjusted wage gaps between single men and women. The gender <b>pay</b> <b>gaps</b> in Nordic countries remain low level, but the negative effects of family-friendly policies and over-crowded public sector may have led to the relatively high family wage gaps in these countries. On the other hand, modest increases in wage inequality and the improved rewards to skills in the competitive markets which favor women employed in the labor markets perhaps keep the gender <b>pay</b> <b>gaps</b> modest level in the selected Eastern European countries. In addition, unexplained factors still account for a non-negligible proportion in gender <b>pay</b> <b>gaps,</b> which raises the consideration about the discrimination against women in the labor market among all the selected countries...|$|R
40|$|This is the {{accepted}} {{version of the}} following article: Multiple disadvantage and wage growth: the effect of merit <b>pay</b> on <b>pay</b> <b>gaps.</b> Human Resource Management, 2015, which has been published in final form at [URL] article concerns rates of wage growth among women and minority groups {{and their impact on}} <b>pay</b> <b>gaps.</b> Specifically, it focuses on the pay progression of people with more than one disadvantaged identity, and on the impact of merit pay. Recent research indicates that <b>pay</b> <b>gaps</b> for people in more than one disadvantaged identity category are wider than those with a single-disadvantaged identity. It is not known whether these gaps are closing, at what rate, and whether all groups are affected equally; nor is it known whether merit pay alleviates or exacerbates existing <b>pay</b> <b>gaps.</b> In addressing these issues, the analysis draws on longitudinal payroll data from a large UK-based organization. Results show that <b>pay</b> <b>gaps</b> are closing; however, the rate of convergence is slow relative to the size of existing pay disparities, and slowest of all for people with disabilities. When the effect of merit pay is isolated, it is found to have a small positive effect in reducing <b>pay</b> <b>gaps,</b> and this effect is generally larger for dual/multiple-disadvantaged groups. These findings run counter to the well-established critique of merit pay in relation to equality outcomes.

40|$|Although pay {{differences}} between men and women with comparable characteristics are generally smaller in the nonprofit than in the for-profit sector, gender <b>pay</b> <b>gaps</b> in the nonprofit sector vary widely across industries. In some industries, gender <b>pay</b> <b>gaps</b> are as large as in the for-profit sector, but in others, women make more than comparably qualified men. Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling on the combined 2001 - 2006 American Community Surveys, we test nonprofit labor motivation theories against a gendered-job hypothesis to explain this variation. We find that gender <b>pay</b> <b>gaps</b> in the nonprofit sector are smaller in industries where nonprofits outnumber for-profits and where higher proportions of female-dominated occupations exist...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} both {{a theoretical}} and an empirical {{investigation into the}} impact of job skill types on the black/white pay differentials. The theoretical analysis derives that the more intensively soft/hard skills are used in an occupation, the greater/smaller the black/white pay differential is there in that occupation. Moreover, {{in response to the}} differential <b>pay</b> <b>gaps</b> across jobs requiring different levels of soft/hard skills, blacks are more likely to self-select themselves into the jobs that use hard skills more intensively, ceteris paribus. Using NLSY data, we find consistent empirical evidence to our theoretical predictions. Hence, the paper bridges the existing literature on racial <b>pay</b> <b>gaps</b> and cognitive vs. non-cognitive skills by explicitly testing the impact of job skill types on racial <b>pay</b> <b>gaps...</b>|$|R

We find that openness to experience is the most relevant personality trait followed by neuroticism, agreeableness and extroversion. Openness and extroversion are rewarded while agreeableness and neuroticism are penalized. ...|$|R

We analyse data for about 45, 000 PhD graduates in Bulgaria from the NSI survey Career development of PhD degree holders run in 2007, 2009, and 2010. An attempt is made to measure <b>pay</b> <b>gaps</b> in terms of gender and major of study. Using Mincerian equations, we calculate these <b>pay</b> <b>gaps,</b> and thus we answer the question whether there are any income differences among doctoral degree holders. We find out that a doctoral degree holder in natural or technical science has a significantly higher return than a degree holder in social or humanitarian studies. Another finding is that the greatest gender <b>pay</b> <b>gaps</b> are observed in social and humanitarian studies while the smallest gap is in natural and technical sciences. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effect of {{incentive}} pay on gender <b>pay</b> <b>gaps</b> in Finland, Norway and Sweden among professionals and managers within MNCs. Mercer 2009 Total Remuneration Survey data is utilised. Uniform job ladder, occupation, industry and wage definitions enable consistent cross-country comparisons. In addition to the between-country variation, the within-country variation of gender gap with respect to incentive pay is analysed. The results indicate that gender <b>pay</b> <b>gaps</b> differ among the Nordics and that occupation and industry controls have dissimilar effects across countries. Irrespective of wage element, Finland and Norway are characterised by higher gender gaps than Sweden. Incentives tend to accentuate gender <b>pay</b> <b>gaps.</b> In intention to alleviate the absence of job performance data, this study utilises a rudimentary, promotion-based measure for job performance. In Finland it does affect the gender gap. However, irrespective of gender, high-performers are penalised in Sweden but not in Finland or Norway. The Finnish data also allows the identification of low-performers. Low job performance is rewarded in Finland. Nonetheless, the job performance findings should be interpreted with cautions. ...|$|R

25|$|According to {{a report}} by the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee, the gender <b>pay</b> <b>gap</b> jeopardizes women's {{retirement}} security. Of the multiple sources of income Americans rely on later in life, many are directly linked to a worker's earnings over his or her career. These include Social Security benefits, based on lifetime earnings, and defined benefit pension distributions that are typically calculated using a formula based on a worker's tenure and salary during peak-earnings years. The persistent gender <b>pay</b> <b>gap</b> leaves women with less income from these sources than men. For example, older women's Social Security benefits are 71% of older men's benefits ($11,057 for women versus $15,557 for men in 2009). Incomes from public and private pensions based on women's own work were just 60% and 48% of men's pension incomes, respectively.|$|E
