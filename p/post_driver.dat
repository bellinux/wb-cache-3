5000|$|A {{camouflet}} set is used {{to describe}} a system used in the British Army for cratering tracks and other routes. A tube is driven into the ground using a manual <b>post</b> <b>driver.</b> The end of the tube is a disposable steel point. A small charge connected to a detonator is lowered down the tube. The tube is then removed, and the hole tamped. The charge is then blown, leaving a void and a hole to the surface. This void is then filled with a much larger charge, which is also tamped, and then blown when required to create a crater as an obstacle. A refinement {{was introduced in the}} 1980s, {{with the use of a}} shaped charge to create the initial hole.|$|E

The company began as a manufacturer of heavy equipment snowblowers and grain hitch elevators before changing its name to Erskine Attachments when it began manufacturing a line of Skid Steer Attachments for the Ingersoll Rand Bobcat company. Now private, Erskine Attachments manufactures more than 40 skid steer attachments including brush mowers, snowblowers, blades, buckets, grapples, <b>post</b> <b>drivers,</b> stump grinders, tree shears, and others that fit all skid steers and some front end loaders that utilize the skid steer style quick attach mechanism. Erskine Attachments was used as a pilot for the Minnesota JOBZ incentive program to revitalize Minnesota's manufacturing opportunities and has been referenced for its continuance as a viable success story.|$|R

40|$|A common {{assessment}} of many Pacific Northwest streams {{is that they}} have low instream complexity due to reduced large woody debris (LWD) and degraded riparian areas. A traditional approach to addressing this problem has been to use heavy machinery to install expensive LWD structures (3 ̆e 50 - 100 /m) that are engineered to be stable. In contrast, we are testing a hand-based approach called high density large woody debris (HDLWD) for adding LWD in high densities (e. g., 20 - 50 m between structures) that is inexpensive (3 ̆c 5 - 10 /m), and can be built with minimal disturbance to recovering riparian areas. We use a hydraulic <b>post</b> <b>driver</b> to drive 4 - 6 cm diameter x 1. 5 m long, non-treated, wooden fence posts into the stream bottom and banks to secure hand-placed LWD in place. In contrast to many traditional engineered structures, we expect LWD to remain on these structures for 1 - 5 years, making them dynamic by design. We have built almost 550 structures covering 12 km in wadeable streams within an Intensively Monitored Watershed in southeast Washington. We developed a set of a priori hypotheses about the hydraulic and geomorphic responses the HDLWD would create and are testing these with a variety of survey methods including topographic surveys and rapid habitat surveys. We are still assessing the long-term effectiveness of the structures but we have already observed many of our hypothesized responses including: the creation of eddy pools, scour pools, undercut banks, a variety of bar types, and wood movement and trapping by the structures.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{utilisation}} of the Driver Attitude Questionnaire (DAQ) to examine the self-reported behaviours of a sample of Australian fleet drivers (N = 416). Surveys were <b>posted</b> to <b>drivers</b> who {{agreed to participate in}} the study. Univariate analyses of the four DAQ subscales revealed that respondents were least concerned about speeding, followed by risky overtaking manoeuvres. In contrast, attitudes regarding the seriousness of close following behaviours and drink driving were significantly higher. Additional analyses revealed the speeding factor was associated with self-reported traffic offences, and was predictive of demerit point loss at a multivariate level, even after controlling for driving exposure (i. e., kms driven each year). This paper will further highlight the major findings of the study as well as possible implications regarding the predictive utility of self-reported questionnaires to investigate driving behaviours. 1.

5000|$|For {{most of the}} 1990s and 2000s, {{the track}} boasted the highest speeds on the NASCAR circuit, with a typical {{qualifying}} lap speed of about 193 mph (311 km/h), first <b>posted</b> by <b>driver</b> Breton Roussel on June 22, 1990, and a record lap speed of over 197 mph (317 km/h). In 2004 and 2005, the similarly designed Texas Motor Speedway saw slightly faster qualifying times, and as the tracks' respective racing surfaces have worn, qualifying speeds at Texas have become consistently faster than at Atlanta. The NASCAR circuit has two tracks, the longer Talladega Superspeedway and Daytona International Speedway, that were once faster than Atlanta or Texas, with lap speeds usually exceeding 200 mph (322 km/h), but restrictor plates were mandated for use on those tracks in 1988 after Bobby Allison's violent crash at Talladega the year before, reducing average lap speeds to about 190 mph (306 km/h).

40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{utilisation}} of the Manchester Driving Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ) and the Driving Attitude Questionnaire (DAQ) to examine the self-reported aberrant driving behaviours and safety attitudes of a sample of Australian fleet drivers (N = 443). Surveys were <b>posted</b> to <b>drivers</b> who {{agreed to participate in}} the study. Univariate analyses of the subscales revealed that participants were least concerned about speeding, followed by risky overtaking manoeuvres, while attitudes regarding the seriousness of close following and drink driving were significantly higher. In regards to behaviours, participants were most likely to report engaging in speeding and aggressive violations, and least likely to report making driving errors. Importantly, additional bi-variate analyses revealed that individuals who engaged in regular speeding behaviours and reported risky overtaking manoeuvres were most likely to incur demerit point losses. The results indicate that fleet interventions designed to improve road safety may benefit from focusing on attempting to reduce speeding infringements and the possible "speeding culture" that may exist within the fleet industry. This paper will further outline the major findings of the study, highlight the limitations and provide direction for future fleet safety research...|$|R
