40|$|AbstractA generic {{method for}} the reverse {{processing}} of dry photoresist is proposed. The technique {{is based on}} the lamination of prepatterned polymeric structures on the pre-existing devices. The concept is illustrated with the encapsulation at the foil level of gas sensors made on <b>plastic</b> <b>foil.</b> This polymeric-based technique can be either applied on <b>plastic</b> <b>foils</b> but also on conventional substrates such as silicon or glass. It can be used when standard packaging techniques might not be suitable or when they can represent a significant cost. Using the lamination of a foil, the low-temperature and dry process presented here is compatible with large scale fabrication techniques, such as roll-to-roll processing, and aims at reducing the global fabrication cost of sensing devices made on <b>plastic</b> <b>foil...</b>|$|R

In a reel-to-reel process, metallized <b>plastic</b> <b>foil</b> is patterned by laser ablation and stacked. Foil-to-foil joints are established by heating the foil stack under pressure. Expansion of the foil stack {{perpendicular to the}} plane of the foils yields a multichannel structure.

40|$|The {{intertidal}} reef flat {{surrounding the}} Island Barrang Lompo in the Spermonde Archipelago / Indonesia {{is covered by}} an extensive seagrass meadow dominated by Enhalus acoroides and Thalassia hemprichii. In this study three methods for estimating the diversity and abundance of macrozoobenthic organisms were compared: 18 replicate sediment cores (16 cm diameter, to 30 cm depth) were taken and the content was sieved over a 1 mm screen. All organisms living (partly) {{on top of the}} sediment or leaving visible signs of their presence (e. g. burrow openings, sediment expulsion mounds) were counted within three replicate circles of 6 m diameter. Three replicate <b>plastic</b> <b>foils</b> (3 * 4 m) were installed on top of the sediment and their surface covered with a thin layer of sand. Subsequently, all organisms that either lived on the surface or were found emerging under the <b>plastic</b> <b>foil</b> in search of oxygen were collected after 24, 48 and 72 hours. The by far largest number of species (ca. 250) was found using the <b>plastic</b> <b>foil</b> method, followed by the corer (ca. 75) and the counting circles (ca. 30). Estimates for the abundance of small species that live on or near the surface were highest with the corer method. Larger and deep burrowing species were only caught with the <b>plastic</b> <b>foil</b> and their numbers were much higher than estimated from surface signs. It is concluded that the <b>plastic</b> <b>foil</b> method has a high potential to enhance studies of both diversity and abundance, especially regarding large and deep burrowing organisms which have no surface activity, are impossible or very difficult to catch using other methods, and therefore often underreported...|$|R

On all muscles, 24 h after slaughtering, sensory evaluation was carried out and the following parameters determined: pH value, colour, water binding ability, cooking loss and tenderness (initial values). The remaining part of each muscle was divided into 6 parts, 3 were packaged in <b>plastic</b> <b>foil</b> (control samples), and other 3 were soaked in solution containing 0, 4 % CaCl 2 and 0, 4 % NaCl and packaged in <b>plastic</b> <b>foil.</b> Pieces of meat prepared in this way were left on temperature of + 4 0 C 7, 14 and 21 days to mature.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} physics-based {{cruising}} speed model for biomimetic robotic fish propelled by the passive <b>plastic</b> <b>foil</b> actuator.

Experimental results have shown that the proposed model is able to predict the steady-state cruising speed of the robotic fish under a periodic actuation input. Since most of the model parameters are expressed in terms of fundamental physical properties and geometric dimensions, the model is expected to be beneficial in optimal design of the robotic fish...|$|R

50|$|The {{inner cover}} {{provides}} a barrier between the telescoping cover and the bees. In more temperate climates, a <b>plastic</b> <b>foil</b> {{may be used}} as an inner cover. <b>Plastic</b> <b>foil</b> should not be used to winter bees under, as trapped condensation would cause the hive to become wet, and bees can be lost due to freezing when temperatures fall during the night. In areas with a hot summer, a solid inner cover with a communication hole provides dead-air space for insulation against both heat and cold. This prevents the bees from gluing the top cover to the top bars of the super under it. When an inner cover is used, the top cover is more easily removed from the hive. Notches in the frame of the solid inner cover and telescoping cover can serve as an upper entrance for the bees. A communication hole in the middle allows bees to reach emergency food placed above by the beekeeper if it becomes required.|$|R
