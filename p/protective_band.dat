The CRE called on bookshops to remove the comic, stating that it contained [...] "hideous racial prejudice" [...] by depicting Congolese who [...] "look like monkeys and talk like imbeciles." [...] Responding that it was committed to letting its [...] "customers make the choice", Borders moved the book to an area reserved for adult graphic novels. UK bookseller Waterstone's followed suit. [...] Another British retailer, WHSmith, said that the book was sold on its website, but with a label that recommended it for readers aged 16 and over. The CRE's attempt to ban the book was criticised by Conservative Party politician Ann Widdecombe, who remarked that the organisation had more important things to do than regulate the availability of historical children's books. The media controversy increased interest in the book, and Borders reported that its sales of Tintin in the Congo had been boosted 4,000%, while it also rose to eighth on the Amazon.com bestseller list. Publisher Egmont UK also responded to racism concerns by placing a <b>protective</b> <b>band</b> around the book with a warning about its content and writing an introduction describing its historical context.|$|E
40|$|AbstractUsing the way {{of driving}} and filling by solid wastes to replace parts of coal is an {{important}} technical path for solving protective coal pillar of "under three" coal mining and industry square in our coal mine, and the key depends on whether the new bearing structure formed by backfill and residual pillars can effectively substitute for the original large coal pillars or not. We obtained the influencing factors from stable dual bearing structure by the establishing mathematical model and researching on mechanism of overlying strata of dual bearing structure. Combined with the actual condition of <b>protective</b> <b>band</b> coal pillar of filling and recovery, some elements which are important to coal pillar stability have been researched, such as {{the width of the}} middle pillar, quantity of filling roadway, size of filling roadway, and grade of filling roadway. The results are successfully applied to the recovery of <b>protective</b> <b>band</b> coal pillar in the 4 th region of the 1300 mining area that its surface is stability and some parts of coal pillars are recovered, and thus obtain a well engineering application purpose and economy benefit...|$|E

50|$|Rustin {{developed}} his ideas from 1908 with his colleague, Jean Larroque, registering a first patent, number 397 424, on December 15, 1908. Research {{ended with the}} start of World War I in 1914. Rustin fought in the army, {{then returned to the}} tyre industry after demobilisation, opening a workshop at 16 rue du Bois in Clichy (now the rue Henri Barbusse). It was there that he made the first modern puncture patch, a thin circular patch of flexible rubber that was already coated with a gum that {{did not need to be}} heated. He patented his invention, offering “ instant repair of inner tubes without solutions, without petrol, without anything ” The patent covered the patch, the dry fixative attached to it, and the <b>protective</b> <b>bands</b> which kept the patch clean until they were removed just before the repair.|$|R
40|$|To examine which component(s) of soy {{proteins}} are diabetogenic, {{studies were}} designed to look at diabetes-related soy protein fractions. In a study of diabetes-prone and control BB (BioBreeding) rats, sera from BBc (non-diabetes-prone), BBdp (diabetes-prone), BBd-U (diabetic untreated) and BBd-T (diabetic insulin-treated) rats at different risk of developing diabetes were tested against the proteins extracted from different soy protein sources. A diabetes-related protein designated S 10 was identified and reactivity against two <b>protective</b> <b>bands</b> designated S 6 and S 13 was associated with less risk of developing diabetes. Two separate cross sectional and prospective (blood samples collected at 45 d, 70 d and 149 d or at diagnosis) studies were carried out. Western blotting results in both studies confirmed that high S 10 reactivity in the pre-diabetic period was associated with diabetes. Overall Western blot analyses showed interestingly that two soy protein-fractions, S 6 and S 13, were related to resistance and reactivity against these two fractions may be protective and the S 10 soy protein fraction appears to be highly diabetes-related and associated with diabetes. In studies using human serum, two sets of blood samples from newly diagnosed diabetic children showed the same association for the S 10 soy protein fraction. Early oral dosing with soybean meal delayed the onset of diabetes and protected some of the animals from developing the disease. Pre-absorption studies showed there was an overall reduction in reactivity to soy antigens using pre-absorbed sera. This indicated some cross reactivity between food antigens and RIN cell proteins.

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{application}} of methods of landscape planning {{in order to maintain the}} sustainable state of the coastal south-western part of the Crimean peninsula. There are many protected landscapes in this territory, including reserves and other specially protected landscapes. However, the network of such specially protected natural resources can not fully satisfy the resources they consume and simultaneously maintain a favorable ecological situation in the region. The results of studies of the prospects and prerequisites for the formation and preservation of the landscape-ecological framework of the South-Western Crimea have been presented. Various groups of factors that negatively affect the ecological state of the region are analyzed, among them construction in coastal <b>protective</b> <b>bands,</b> recreational digression of soils and vegetation, pollution with industrial wastewater, illegal sand sampling, etc. Assessment of nature use structures has shown that the existing system needs landscape-ecological justification and planning. The structure of the landscape-ecological framework of the South-Western Crimea has been developed. Its elements have been identified, which contain natural “cores” subject to special protection, ecological corridors and buffer zones. In the course of the study, a mapping of the landscapeecological planning organization of the coastal territory of the Crimean coast has been carried out. The map-scheme shows the elements of the landscape-ecological framework, landscape zones and belts and types of anthropogenic landscapes. In the conditions of limited economic development of the territory, the landscape-ecological framework must include transformed anthropogenic landscapes. Landscape planning should be carried out taking into account regional features of the Black Sea coast, for this purpose the article gives a brief description of the landscape diversity and stability of landscape geosystems. The most important tasks that can be solved in the ecological design of the territory have been investigated. The recommendations listed in the article make it possible to provide the analysis not only with respect to the situation in the country, but also can be put into effect with the aim of improving territorial organization of the region...|$|R
2500|$|As Led Zeppelin's {{popularity}} soared {{throughout the}} 1970s, Peter Grant became increasingly notorious for being brutally <b>protective</b> of his <b>band</b> and their finances. [...] The Song Remains the Same captures one such exchange {{between him and}} a concert promoter. [...] When Warner Bros. approved the film they did so on the proviso that expletives would be 'bleeped' out. Clifton took the optical print and bleeped the words, meaning the words were inaudible and the film was given an appropriate rating. However, on every other print the words were retained and were fully audible.|$|R
5000|$|The aim {{of these}} <b>protective</b> forest <b>bands</b> was to {{increase}} the yield of an important area of steppe territory belonging to the Imperial Estates. It was planned to repopulate these areas, providing the inhabitants with water (ponds) and forest. These plantations were intended also to ease the harsh climate of the steppes, the pernicious action of hot winds and droughts, as well as preventing formation of ravines. In the arid steppes of the Samara, Volgograd and Voronezh governorates, some 13 thousand hectares of protective forest belts were planted by 1902. These forest belts were known as [...] "Genko Forests". For economic consideration, {{the width of the}} forest belts was to be 400 to 600 meters. These strips were located mainly on [...] "black earth" [...] along the watersheds, which in the steppes are the most suitable for a forest. The primary orientation was from southwest to northeast, that is, perpendicular to the predominant summer dry winds.|$|R
500|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured from aluminium or steel alloys, and are normally fitted {{with one of}} two common types of cylinder valve for filling and connection to the regulator. Other accessories such as manifolds, cylinder <b>bands,</b> <b>protective</b> nets and boots and carrying handles may be provided. Various configurations of harness {{may be used to}} carry the cylinder or cylinders while diving, depending on the application. Cylinders used for scuba typically have an internal volume (known as water capacity) of between [...] and a maximum working pressure rating from [...] Cylinders are also available in smaller sizes, such as 0.5, 1.5 and 2 litres, however these are often used for purposes such as inflation of surface marker buoys, drysuits and buoyancy compensators rather than breathing. Scuba divers may dive with a single cylinder, a pair of similar cylinders, or a main cylinder and a smaller [...] "pony" [...] cylinder, carried on the diver's back or clipped onto the harness at the sides. Paired cylinders may be manifolded together or independent. In some cases, more that two cylinders are needed.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Climate {{warming is}} causing {{environmental}} change making both marine and terrestrial organisms, and even humans, {{more susceptible to}} emerging diseases. Coral reefs {{are among the most}} impacted ecosystems by climate stress, and immunity of corals, the most ancient of metazoans, is poorly known. Although coral mortality due to infectious diseases and temperature-related stress is on the rise, the immune effector mechanisms that contribute to the resistance of corals to such events remain elusive. In the Caribbean sea fan corals (Anthozoa, Alcyonacea: Gorgoniidae), the cell-based immune defenses are granular acidophilic amoebocytes, which are known to be involved in wound repair and histocompatibility. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We demonstrate {{for the first time in}} corals that these cells are involved in the organismal response to pathogenic and temperature stress. In sea fans with both naturally occurring infections and experimental inoculations with the fungal pathogen Aspergillus sydowii, an inflammatory response, characterized by a massive increase of amoebocytes, was evident near infections. Melanosomes were detected in amoebocytes adjacent to <b>protective</b> melanin <b>bands</b> in infected sea fans; neither was present in uninfected fans. In naturally infected sea fans a concurrent increase in prophenoloxidase activity was detected in infected tissues with dense amoebocytes. Sea fans sampled in the field during the 2005 Caribbean Bleaching Event (a once-in-hundred-year climate event) responded to heat stress with a systemic increase in amoebocytes and amoebocyte densities were also increased by elevated temperature stress in lab experiments. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The observed amoebocyte responses indicate that sea fan corals use cellular defenses to combat fungal infection and temperature stress. The ability to mount an inflammatory response may be a contributing factor that allowed the survival of even infected sea fan corals during a stressful climate event...|$|R
