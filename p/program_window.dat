2500|$|New {{insight into}} the {{testicular}} descent mechanism has been hypothesized by {{the concept of a}} male <b>programming</b> <b>window</b> (MPW) derived from animal studies. According to this concept, testicular descent status is [...] "set" [...] during the period from 8 to 14 weeks of gestation in humans. Undescended testis is a result of disruption in androgen levels only during this <b>programming</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
40|$|Becoming a {{phenotypic}} male {{is ultimately}} determined by androgen-induced masculinization. Disorders of fetal masculinization, resulting in hypospadias or cryptorchidism, are common, but their cause remains unclear. Together with the adult-onset disorders low sperm count and testicular cancer, they can constitute a testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS). Although masculinization is well studied, no unifying concept explains normal male reproductive development and its abnormalities, including TDS. We exposed rat fetuses to either anti-androgens or androgens {{and showed that}} masculinization of all reproductive tract tissues was programmed by androgen action during a common fetal <b>programming</b> <b>window.</b> This preceded morphological differentiation, when androgen action was, surprisingly, unnecessary. Only within the <b>programming</b> <b>window</b> did blocking androgen action induce hypospadias and cryptorchidism and altered penile length in male rats, all of which correlated with anogenital distance (AGD). Androgen-driven masculinization of females was also confined to the same <b>programming</b> <b>window.</b> This work has identified in rats a common <b>programming</b> <b>window</b> in which androgen action is essential for normal reproductive tract masculinization and has highlighted that measuring AGD in neonatal humans could provide a noninvasive method to predict neonatal and adult reproductive disorders. Based on the timings in rats, we believe the <b>programming</b> <b>window</b> in humans {{is likely to be}} 8 – 14 weeks of gestation...|$|R

Heavy ion irradiation has no or negligible immediate effects on the nanocrystal MOSFET characteristics, and on the <b>programming</b> <b>window</b> of the cells. By electrically stressing irradiated device, we see accelerated oxide breakdown similar to that previously observed on conventional thin gate oxide MOS capacitors, but no appreciable change of the degradation kinetics in terms of <b>programming</b> <b>window</b> closure and shift. The accelerated breakdown is ascribed to the degradation of the oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) layer used as control oxide after exposure to ionising irradiation...|$|R

5000|$|Comedy Central Germany was {{licensed}} by the Media Authority of North Rhine-Westphalia (LfM), {{which is also the}} supervising state media authority for the channel. On 24 November 2006, the license of the previous music-oriented interest channel VIVA Plus was changed to entertainment channel Comedy Central. By decision, made by the LfM, dated 19 November 2004, Comedy Central got a license for a period until 20 March 2010.Viacom initially tried to establish the channel independently and as a 24-hour program. Since 15 December 2008, Comedy Central has divided the frequency with its sister program Nickelodeon and therefore transmits only between 8:15pm and 5:45am. Viacom already held a similar designed <b>program</b> <b>window</b> named NICK Comedy from 2005 to 2006, which was discontinued in favor of Comedy Central Germany.Until 1 January 2009 there was a simulcast broadcast of the program on the own and on the shared frequency. Thereafter, until 17 January 2009 at the old time slot, an alternative program scheme was spread before it was briefly replaced by a loop with program notes. During this time, the cable operators have been able to coordinate the frequencies in favor of the new mixed program.From 25 July 2009 to 13 October 2010, Comedy Central used the slogan [...] "TV und lustig" [...] (TV and funny). With this claim, Comedy Central accompanied the viewers through the program. Then the claim was [...] "Enjoy Daily" [...] and was in use by 1 October 2011.Since 1 March 2010 Comedy Central Germany has broadcast only in 16:9 format, with the exception of programs that have been or are produced in 4:3 (American Dad, Roseanne, Comedy Street, Genial Daneben, etc.)On 1 October 2011, the station design was adapted to the new international design used by Comedy Central.Early 2012, the image format of old 4:3 programs were adapted, they are now - as from the beginning to the HD version - scaled to 14:9 format, thus parts of the image at the top and bottom are lost. Since mid-2012, opening credits of most shows are often omitted, the transmission time of a program has thus not changed, it has been adapted to the length of the advertising blocks.Since 29 September 2012, the website is no longer accessible via comedycentral.de. The domain redirected to the new station's website, comedycentral.tv.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a physics-based compact {{model for the}} <b>program</b> <b>window</b> in HfOx {{resistive random access memory}} devices, defined as the ratio of the resistances in high resistance state (HRS) and low resistance state (LRS). This model allows extracting the characteristics of the conductive filament (CF) in HRS. For a given forming current compliance limit, the <b>program</b> <b>window</b> is shown to be correlated to the thickness of the reoxidized portion of the CF in HRS, which can be modulated by the reset voltage amplitude. On the other hand, the statistical distribution of the memory window depends exponentially on the barrier thickness variations that points to the critical role of reset conditions for the performance optimization of RRAM devices...|$|E
40|$|A {{program can}} be refined either by {{transforming}} the whole program or by refining one of its components. The refinement of a component is, for the main part, independent of {{the remainder of the}} program. However, refinement of a component can depend on the context of the component for information about the variables that are in scope and what their types are. The refinement can also take advantage of additional information, such as any precondition the component can assume. The aim {{of this paper is to}} introduce a technique, which we call <b>program</b> <b>window</b> inference, to handle such contextual information during derivations in the refinement calculus. The idea is borrowed from a technique, called window inference, for handling context in theorem proving. Window inference has been incorporated into the proof development tool Ergo, and this tool has been adapted to support <b>program</b> <b>window</b> inference for program refinement...|$|E
