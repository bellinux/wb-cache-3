2500|$|The wing which {{finally brought}} the mansion to its present-day {{appearance}} {{is no better}} documented {{than the rest of}} the house. Opinion on the exact date of construction of the south wing is divided ("L" [...] on plan), given dates between 1670 and 1680 or suggested to have been started as early as 1636 and completed in the early years of the Restoration of 1660. Dating the wing is essential in identifying the architect: the south wing, if considered to date in the 1630s, was often attributed to Inigo Jones—many English houses make this claim, some like Wilton House with more plausibility than others — until Christopher Hussey debunked the myth in 1927. Hussey's claim was largely based on the assumption that the south wing was completed in 1680, at a time when Jones would have been dead for 20 years. The most noticeable similarity between Jones's documented work and Brympton d'Evercy is the use of alternating triangular and segmental window pediments, but Jones only ever used this motif to give importance to the windows of the piano nobile, at Brympton d'Evercy the alternating pediments give both floors equal value. At Brympton the piano nobile is most unusual in being on the ground floor. It is doubtful a master architect who had designed for the Royal family, and the highest echelons of the aristocracy, would have considered such a siting. Also typical of Jones, but a common feature of the time, is the balustrade parapet hiding a hipped roof. However, the greatest architectural clues which suggest Jones had no hand in the design of the mansion are basic: the architect of Brympton d'Evercy gave the facade 10 bays, which meant the windows begin with a segmental pediment and end with a triangular one, and no master architect would have permitted such an affront to balance. Finally, as the house is of ten bays, there is no central focal point: this is not an architectural crime, but what is an architectural crime is that the South front in its centre does have a focal <b>point–</b> a drain pipe, which has been sited there since the building's completion. The evidence seems to suggest that the South facade was probably inspired by Hinton House, at nearby Hinton St George, (the childhood home of Sir John Posthumous Sydenham's wife) completed in 1638. These two houses together with Long Ashton House were most probably designed and built by the same local family of architects and masons, working from drawings by Serlio's treatise on architecture published in five volumes in London in 1611.|$|E
