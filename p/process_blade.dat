40|$|Mechanical surface {{treatments}} that introduce {{a layer of}} residual surface compression improve high cycle fatigue (HCF) performance. If the depth of compression extends through the thickness of blade or vane edges, foreign object damage (FOD) tolerance can be dramatically improved. The effect of low plasticity burnishing (LPB) on the HCF performance and FOD tolerance of a first stage Ti- 6 Al- 4 V turbine engine vane have been investigated in both tension-tension (R= 0. 1) and fully revered bending (R=- 1). Actual vanes from fielded engines and blade-edge feature samples were fatigue tested with FOD simulated by EDM notches. The fatigue strength for LPB <b>processed</b> <b>blades</b> increased over 4 -fold for both vanes and vane-edge feature specimens with FOD 0. 020 in. deep, and was undiminished by 0. 030 in. deep FOD. Assuming a Kt = 3 HCF performance criteria, LPB provided tolerance of FOD up to 0. 10 in. deep. The beneficial through-thickness compression was retained even for compressive loading in fully reversed bending.

However, it is important to analyse in detail the stress distribution in each blade and to consider the mechanical and metallurgical characteristics of the airfoil geometry, weld configuration and filler metal strength. Stress profiles and life predictions are calculated for weld repaired turbine blades, comparing low strength and high strength filler metal welds. The stress levels in the tip repaired region and in the hole region of a blade with a lashing wire are calculated using finite element analysis.

This concept is considered as the basis of the dominant position of the Danish wind industry through the following decades.In 1990, Stiesdal had overall responsibility for Vindeby Offshore Wind Farm, the world’s first offshore wind farm, including the first offshore adaptation of wind turbines. The wind farm, comprising 11 450 kW turbines, was installed in 1991. From 1995 onwards, Stiesdal was responsible for the development of the proprietary IntegralBlade® manufacturing technology. [...] In this manufacturing <b>process,</b> <b>blades</b> are cast in one piece, eliminating weak spots of known technologies.In 1996, Stiesdal developed the CombiStall® blade regulation system which was fully implemented in the company’s megawatt-range turbines. Two years later in 1998, Stiesdal designed the first variable-speed turbine for Bonus Energy A/S. The technology was tested commercially in 2002 and from 2005 onwards, it has been used in all of Siemens’ new products. From 1999 onwards, Stiesdal was in charge of the development of Siemens’ Direct Drive technology, eliminating the gearbox which is the classical weak spot of traditional wind turbine design. Stiesdal is involved in around 175 inventions, including thermal storage.|$|R
