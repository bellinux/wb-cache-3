40|$|Higher {{education}} displays {{characteristics of}} {{both private and}} public goods and there is a trend worldwide to expect individuals to pay more of the costs of their higher education. In South Africa public funding of higher education decreased from 0. 86 % of GDP in 1986 to only 0. 66 % in 2006. Due to the decrease in state appropriations, student tuition fees had to be increased to compensate for this loss of income. In the process staff numbers were kept relatively constant, while student numbers increased at a much faster rate. Two future scenarios, based on public higher education expenditure as a percentage of GDP and on real state allocation per WFTES, are included. Although the qualifications awarded per FTE academic staff member increased over time, the graduation rates of the higher education institutions in South Africa are worsening. High-level research, measured in <b>publication</b> <b>units</b> per FTE academic staff member, shows a disturbing decreasing trend since 1997. Higher education, education financing, qualifications...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} two decades state funding of higher {{education}} in South Africa has decreased substantially (especially if public expenditure of HE as a percentage of GDP is used as a yardstick). HE institutions were forced to increase tuition fees and rely more on the third income stream to balance their books. In the process increases in instruction/research staff did not keep up with the increase in student numbers. During the period 1986 - 2003 qualifications awarded to students per full-time equivalent instruction/research staff member increased over time – indicating greater efficiency of the HE sector in delivering more teaching output. High-level research in the form of <b>publication</b> <b>units</b> in accredited journals, however, stagnated during this period. In recent years until 2007, however, publications in accredited journals increased substantially. This was mainly the result of broadening the number of accredited journals by the Department of Education. In this paper two indicators, linked to the current funding formula for higher education, to measure academic output of HEIs are defined and applied to the output of institutions for the period since 2002. It is concluded that there is large variability between HEIs as far as teaching and research output are concerned. A cause for concern is {{that the majority of the}} research is conducted by just a few HE institutions. Higher education, Financing, Subsidy formula, Education output...|$|E
40|$|From Introduction] Rhodes University {{maintained}} and improved its {{track record of}} research performance in 2009, a very pleasing trend given that it came directly after a large increase of accredited publication outputs in 2008 of 20. 3 %, and a flattening of the growth curve was expected. The increase in accredited <b>publication</b> <b>units</b> for 2009 of 6. 4 % (from 330. 02 units to 350. 99 units) {{is closer to the}} growth rate for the sector as a whole. This continued increase in research publications was achieved against the backdrop of substantial financial constraints and changes in the funding programmes of the National Research Foundation, a primary source of funding for researchers at Rhodes, which produced significant discontinuities in funding for several established researchers. Our journal output, (which accounts for 86 % of our total accredited publishing output for higher education subsidy purposes) grew by 5. 1 % from 2008 to 2009 (from 287. 82 units to 302. 64 units). The previous year’s growth was 11. 3 % in this category. Coupled with Rhodes’s high volume of accredited journal outputs in relation to its size, a very pleasing quality measure was that 81. 6 % of Journal outputs (amongst the highest proportions in the sector) appeared in international accredited journals. Our output from accredited conference proceedings, (which in 2009 amounted to 7 % of our total accredited publishing output) shrunk by 27. 5 % (from 33. 22 units down to 24. 07 units) from 2008 to 2009 – but from a small base where more year-on-year variance can be expected. This category had grown by 202 % in the preceding year, so the 2009 reduction cannot be taken to represent a trend. The book outputs (which in 2009 amounted to 7 % of our total accredited publishing output) increased by 170 % – again from a very small base (from 8. 89 units up to 24. 28 units), where year-on-year variance is expected. This category had grown by 91 % in the previous year, but had seen a negative growth of 83 % in the year before that. The 2009 growth in this category is a combination of increased submissions, and an improved acceptance rate. The staff responsible for this process in the Research Office, and the researchers who made the submissions, are to be warmly congratulated. I add my warm thanks and congratulations to all of our researchers, funders, collaborators and partners who contributed to the excellent research results of 2009...|$|E
