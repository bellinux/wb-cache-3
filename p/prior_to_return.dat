You must tell Walls this, unless he would have the business a secret from you: in that case only say I did all I could with Ned Southwell, and it can't be done; for it must be laid before Lord Treasurer, etc., who will not do it; and besides, it is not worth troubling his lordship.

50|$|Due to routing {{arrangements}} and track usage agreements, gondola {{cars and other}} rolling stock are often used to transport goods {{on more than one}} railroad before reaching the end customer. Under the laws governing railway transport, individual railroads paid a fee, called demurrage, for the excess time other railroads held these cars (whether laden or not) <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to their owning road. The demurrage fees were thought to promote the rapid return of rolling stock, since delays equated to extra money spent.|$|E

After refit on the River Thames, Banff escorted convoys OS 3, SL 86, OS 9, SL 92, OS 14 and SL 97 prior to installation of HF/DF. Banff then escorted convoys OS 19, SL102, OS 30, SL 114, OS 36 and SL 120 prior to assignment to Operation Torch. Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar was installed during refit at Immingham following escort of North African invasion convoys.

After a trip to Chesapeake Bay escorting convoys GUS 10X and UT 1, Banff completed refit at HMNB Devonport and joined the Kilindini Escort Force in November 1943.

40|$|Background: Knee reinjury after {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is common and {{increases the risk of}} osteoarthritis. There is sparse evidence to guide return to sport (RTS) decisions in this population. Objectives: To assess the relationship between knee reinjury after ACL reconstruction and 1) return to level I sports, 2) timing of return to sports, and 3) knee function <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>return.</b> Methods: 106 patients who participated in pivoting sports participated in this prospective two year cohort study. Sports participation and knee reinjury were recorded monthly. Knee function was assessed with the Knee Outcome Survey–Activities of Daily Living Scale, global rating scale of function, and quadriceps strength and hop test symmetry. Pass RTS criteria was defined as scores > 90 on all tests, failure as failing any. Results: Patients who returned to level I sports had 4. 32 (p= 0. 048) higher reinjury rate than those who did not. The reinjury rate was significantly reduced by 51 % for each month RTS was delayed until 9 months after surgery, after which no further risk reduction was observed. 38. 2 % of those who failed RTS criteria suffered reinjuries versus 5. 6 % of those who passed (HR: 0. 16, p= 0. 075). More symmetrical quadriceps strength <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> significantly reduced the knee reinjury rate. Conclusion: Returning to level I sports after ACL reconstruction leads to a more than 4 -fold increase in reinjury rates over 2 years. Return to sport 9 months or later after surgery and more symmetrical quadriceps strength <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> substantially reduces the reinjury rate...|$|E
