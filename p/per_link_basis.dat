40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] article presents capacity planning rules for the control plane of all-optical networks featuring GMPLS and RSVP-TE as a connection setup protocol. As per RSVP standard, a refresh message mechanism is incorporated to RSVP such {{that the state is}} periodically refreshed on a link <b>per</b> <b>link</b> <b>basis.</b> We provide analytical expressions for the bandwidth and buffer sizes to be provided such that no flows are torn down due to lack of refresh messages. Our findings show that small buffers (several KBytes) suffice to sustain the signaling load for as much as 400 RSVP flows per link, with the simplest RSVP refresh mechanism (neither using link bundling nor acknowledgments). On the other hand, we also find the packet drop probability per link for a given network topology for the case that the flow survival probability is larger than a given threshold. We provide numerical examples based on the COST 239 european network topology and real RSVP traffic traces from early-commercial switching equipment.

Routing and wavelength allocation models generally assume that the optical network is uniform and that the number of wavelengths <b>per</b> <b>link</b> is a constant. In practice however, some nodes and links carry heavy traffic and additional wavelengths are needed in those links. We study a wavelength-routed optical network based on the UK JANET topology where traffic demands between nodes are assumed to be non-uniform. We investigate how network capacity can be increased by locating congested links and suggesting cost-effective upgrades. Different traffic demands patterns, hop distances, number of wavelengths <b>per</b> <b>link,</b> and routing algorithms are considered. Numerical results show that a 95 % increase in network capacity is possible by overlaying fibre on just 5 % of existing links. We conclude that non-uniform traffic allocation can be beneficial to localize traffic in nodes and links deep in the network core and provisioning of additional resources there can efficiently and cost-effectively increase network capacity...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} {{problem in}} multifiber WDM networks {{is to decide}} how many fibers <b>per</b> <b>link</b> are required to guarantee high network performance. The fiber requirement may depend on many factors, e. g., the network topology, traffic patterns, the number of wavelengths per fiber, and the routing algorithm employed in the network. We study the fiber requirement under dynamic traffic in different topologies with alternate path routing (APR) in this paper. A new analytical model is developed to evaluate the blocking performance of such networks. Our analytical and simulation {{results show that the}} number of required fibers <b>per</b> <b>link</b> to provide high network performance is slightly higher in the APR than the fixed-path routing (FPR).

40|$|Abstract — Optical {{amplifiers}} are {{key elements}} of any fiber-optic communication system. Even though modern optical fibers have losses below 0. 2 dB/km, a repeated amplification of the transmitted signal to its original strength becomes necessary at long enough distances. One solution for signal regeneration is {{the conversion of the}} optical signal into the electrical domain and subsequent re-conversion into a fresh optical signal. This paper has proposed the investigation of the soliton and MTDM techniques to be processed to handle both bit rate and product either <b>per</b> <b>link</b> or <b>per</b> channel for cables of multi-links (40 - 240 links/core). Two multiplexing techniques are applied, ultra wide wavelength division multiplexing (UW-WDM) and ultra wide space division multiplexing (UW-SDM), where maximum number of transmitted channels is processed to handle the product of bit rate either per channel or <b>per</b> <b>link</b> for cables of multi-links. The soliton and MTDM transmission bit rates and products either <b>per</b> <b>link</b> or <b>per</b> channel are also treated over wide range of the affecting parameters. The amplification process is essentially independent of the details of the spectral channel layout, modulation format or data rate of the transmission...|$|R

40|$|Published {{data for}} the {{operational}} energy consumption, and related emissions, of a given type of train can be extremely variable. This is thought in part {{to be due to}} a reliance on limited empirical data and simulations which require a number of assumptions, but some variation in practice is still to be expected. Factors which affect the operational energy consumption of a train include driving style, features of the route and service and temporal factors such as the time of day and the time of year. In Great Britain, a number of Train Operating Companies (TOCs) have fitted meters to the electric trains they operate, in order to better monitor electricity consumption. Two such operators have provided sets of recorded energy data, along with related data about the operations and schedules of the trains. It has been possible to generate a set of energy consumption data on a <b>per</b> seat-km <b>basis,</b> <b>linked</b> with a number of known routes and services. In some cases, sufficient data were also available to make inferences about the influence of the driver. This comprehensive dataset, comprising over 45, 000 sample journeys, has enabled the relative importance of the possible factors which can lead to variation in operational energy consumption to be investigated. It is found that aspects of the route and service are important, especially the stopping density of suburban services. This might help enhance modal comparisons, and rail planners may be able to optimise the service patterns to reduce energy consumption accordingly...|$|R
