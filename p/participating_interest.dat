The major gas filed in the block, Muda, is about 260 km from Songkhla in Southern Thailand and about 380 km from Kemaman supply base in East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia.

40|$|The oil {{industry}} {{is no doubt}} facing challenges following the low crude price that since mid 2014 have affected the market. This has likely increased the need to monetize assets, vertically integrate businesses or seek other companies (even competitors) {{for the purpose of}} deepen market and technical expertise and grow market share. As a consequence, mergers and acquisitions in the {{oil industry}} have increased. <b>Participating</b> <b>interest</b> in petroleum projects are also transferred among actors through sale, assignment, encumbrance or other disposition of rights and obligations. Successfully managing a transfer of a <b>participating</b> <b>interest</b> can be very challenging. Recognizing some specific issues early on in a deal will simplify the process and drive these deals for success. One of the key elements to address is rights of pre-emption. This preferential mechanism is commonly found in Joint Operating Agreements (JOAs) in order to grant existent parties to the petroleum project a preferential right to acquire the interest being transferred by one of their co-venturers. However, the inclusion of pre-emption clauses requires careful considerations by the parties to the JOA about the risks associated with pre-emption rights. It may very well be that standardised clauses do not cover innovative methods of transferring interests to parties outside of the JOA. In addition, the interference of the governing law in the construction and interpretation of the contract as well as the hindrances associated with political contexts where the contract area resides will be of most importance when a transfer of interest is to take place...|$|E

40|$|The Supreme Court of the United States has {{during a}} long time held an {{important}} role in forming the application of American public policy. This study aims to answer the question of what ideological conflict dimensions is present in the context of interest groups attempting to influence the court using amicus curiae briefs. Also, it examines if the participation of interest groups is part of a pattern over several cases or rather isolated to individual issues. Although there exists earlier research concerned with the influence of interest groups on the Supreme Court, the ideological dimensions to their activities has been left unexplored. This study aims to remedy that shortcoming. The conflict of petitioner against respondent is used as an ideological benchmark, affiliations are distributed to the <b>participating</b> <b>interest</b> groups by categorization of their submitted briefs. The ideological dimensions of liberal and conservative, as well as a second dimension of libertarian and authoritarian is investigated. It is concluded that the interest groups submitting amicus curiae is primarily focused on the individual issues of the cases rather than their participation being part of a strategy to influence the court on a wider range of issues. However, among those interest groups participating in more than one case a conflict dimension of liberal and conservative is identified. The result of the study leads to the conclusion that further research with regards to the ideological dimensions of interest groups and the Supreme Court should primarily focus on the context of individual cases...|$|E
40|$|Community {{benefits}} agreements (CBAs) are {{hailed by}} land use reform advocates as an effective, flexible, inclusive tool for making land use decision-making processes {{more responsive to}} traditionally underserved communities. Using the power of community organizing to gain leverage over developers as they navigate zoning and other regulatory chokepoints, CBAs allow traditionally disorganized residents and businesses to extract benefits and conditions directly from developers. This value capture process, reformists argue, helps reduce {{the negative impact of}} diffuse economic and social externalities that either cannot or will not be mitigated by the traditional land use regulatory apparatus. The reformist narrative, however, fails to account for the overriding strength of one particular subset of <b>participating</b> <b>interest</b> groups—that of organized labor—in leading the charge for community benefits. Those interests, this paper argues, often wield disproportionate power in the informal negotiations underlying the formation of a CBA, and have structured CBAs so as to avoid the preemptive effects of federal labor law. In so doing, labor’s preeminent interests may undermine the very goals of efficiency, inclusion, and equity in distribution of developers’ rents that CBAs purport to advance. This paper evaluates this claim by telling the story of one particular deal in New Haven: a CBA negotiated in advance of a public land sale to an independent charter school management organization. By analyzing the deal against both the historical development of CBAs and the normative criteria against which scholars have evaluated other land use controls, this paper aims to shed light on whether the structural incentives built into CBAs may underserve interests that the existing regulatory regime is designed to protect...|$|E
40|$|Public {{participation}} {{has become}} an important component to many decision-making processes. It has many benefits, both for the participant {{as well as the}} decision-maker. It provides education and raises public awareness on important issues. It can reduce conflict between competing interest groups. It increases the willingness to accept programs to which participation is contributed. As part of the Fisheries Reform Act of 1997, the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries (DMF) is developing an integrated approach to coastal management. The North Carolina Coastal Habitat Protection Plan (CHPP) will be the first attempt at regulatory co-management of commercially important coastal fish habitats. Within the scope of this project, DMF has included a public participation aspect to the writing and researching process. To increase the level of cooperation and support to this new management approach, DMF and the North Carolina Coastal Federation began an outreach campaign that started with the distribution of educational materials and resulted in the execution of 10 public meetings. I conducted a survey of participants who attended the ten public meetings. I assessed the representation of <b>participating</b> <b>interest</b> groups, the distribution tactics of the publications, and the effectiveness of the educational portion of the meetings. I also evaluated the respondents’ satisfaction with the level of knowledge gained from the outreach materials and the meetings. Anticipated future involvement in the process was an indicator {{of the success of the}} campaign. The results of this project indicate that the meetings and public outreach campaign succeeded in many ways. They provided education for the participating citizens, and they increased interest for future involvement in environmental issues. However, representation of target populations, such as fishermen and developers, did not meet the expressed goals of NCCF and DMF. Distribution tactics and outreach procedures should be reanalyzed to further increase the interest of the CHPP process for broader involvement of interest groups. As this is an ongoing process, it is important to see how public participation benefits citizens so that the decision-makers can work to maintain, or increase citizens’ level of interest in the CHPP process...|$|E
