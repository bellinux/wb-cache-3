This assessment based on on-road measurements along a specified route on selected days during different seasons in 2001 / 2002, covering urban, suburban and rural regions. Special focus {{was put on the}} investigation and characterization of particles in the fine (? 3), while corresponding mean background values for urban and freeway-influenced areas were typically 35 000 cm ? 3 and > 80 000 cm ? 3, respectively.

40|$|Phototoxicity {{consists}} in {{the capability of}} certain innocuous molecules to become toxic when subjected to suitable illumination. In order to discover new photoactive drugs or characterize phototoxic pollutants, it would be advantageous to use simple biological tests of phototoxicy. In this work, we present a pilot screening of 37 dyes to test for phototoxic effects in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. Populations of this nematode were treated with different dyes, and subsequently exposed to 30 min of white light. Behavioral outcomes were quantified by recording the global motility using an infrared tracking device (WMicrotracker). Of the tested compounds, 17 dyes were classified as photoactive, being phloxine B, primuline, eosin Y, acridine orange and rose Bengal the most phototoxic. To assess photoactivity after uptake, compounds were retested after washing {{them out of the}} medium before light irradiation. Dye uptake into the worms was also analyzed by staining or fluorescence. All the positive drugs were incorporated by animals and produced phototoxic effects after washing. We also tested the stress response being triggered by the treatments through reporter strains. Endoplasmic reticulum stress response (hsp- 4 ::GFP strain) was activated by 22 % of phototoxic dyes, and mitochondrial stress response (hsp- 6 ::GFP strain) was induced by 16 % of phototoxic dyes. These results point to a phototoxic perturbation of the protein functionality and an oxidative stress similar to that reported in cell cultures.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the mathematical formulations used for contaminant fate and transport in the groundwater pathway of the Multimedia Environmental <b>Pollutant</b> <b>Assessment</b> System (MEPAS). It {{is one in}} a series of reports that collectively describe the components of MEPAS. The groundwater component of the MEPAS methodology models solute transport through the groundwater environment (i. e., partially saturated and saturated zones). Specifically, this component provides estimates of groundwater contaminant fluxes at various transporting medium interfaces (e. g., water table or aquifer/river interface) and contaminant concentrations at withdrawal wells. Contaminant fluxes at transporting medium interfaces represent boundary conditions for the next medium in which contaminant migration and fate is to be simulated (e. g., groundwater contamination entering a surface-water environment). Contaminant concentrations at withdrawal wells provide contaminant levels for the exposure assessment component of MEPAS. A schematic diagram illustrating the groundwater environment is presented. The migration and fate of contaminants through the groundwater environment are described by the three-dimensional, advective-dispersive equation for solute transport. The results are based on semianalytical solutions (i. e., solutions that require numerical integration) that are well established in the scientific literature. To increase computational efficiency, limits of integration are also identified...|$|E

The rise in air transport activity {{has been accompanied}} by an increase in the amount of energy used to provide air transportation services. It is also assumed to increase environmental impacts, in particular pollutant emissions. Traditionally, the environmental impacts of atmospheric emissions from aircraft have been addressed in two separate ways; aircraft pollutant emissions occurring during the landing and take-off (LTO) phase (local pollutant emissions) which is the focus of this study, and the non-LTO phase (global/regional pollutant emissions). Aircraft pollutant emissions are an important source of pollution and directly or indirectly harmfully affect human health, ecosystems and cultural heritage. There are many methods to asses pollutant emissions used by various countries. However, using different and separate methodology will cause a variation in results, some lack of information and the use of certain methods will require justification and reliability that must be demonstrated and proven.

40|$|This {{mathematical}} model for contaminant transport in rivers provides a preliminary {{assessment of the}} contaminant mass and concentration using environmental partitioning. First, the model uses the advection-dispersion equation to model the river flow and contaminant transport in the water. Second, the model uses compartment modeling to partition the contaminant mass into water, sediment, bed sediment, air, fish, vegetation and free product environmental compartments. Finally, the model calculates contaminant concentration in each environmental compartment. As long as this approach is applied {{with an understanding of}} its assumptions and limitations, it can be very useful as a preliminary assessment model for contaminant transport in rivers. The purpose of developing this approach was to provide a simple {{mathematical model}} that accounts for the time-varying partitioning of contaminant concentration at a given location along the river. This approach is intended to be used as part of the Multimedia Environmental <b>Pollutant</b> <b>Assessment</b> System (MEPAS). Currently MEPAS, and other multimedia contaminant environmental transport and exposure risk assessment methodologies, assumes that once the contaminant enters the water, it is instantaneously and completely dissolved.

40|$|A {{model has}} been {{developed}} to estimate the source quantity of UXO {{for use as a}} source term model within the Army Risk Assessment Modeling System (ARAMS). ARAMS is based on the widely accepted risk paradigm, where exposure and effects assessments are integrated to characterize risk. ARAMS allows the UXO model to be readily used as a component in human and/or ecological health risk characterizations for estimating the mass of explosives that is needed as information to drive media fate/transport models, such as leaching through the vadose zone and runoff into surface waters. Calculated temporal media concentrations are then used within ARAMS to compute exposure and assess effects both current and future. The UXO model provides an estimate of the source quantity of UXO using data from firing range records and other sources. The model is an enhancement of the Multimedia Environmental <b>Pollutant</b> <b>Assessment</b> System (MEPAS) Computed Source Term Release Model. The output from the UXO model can be used with other components of the ARAMS modeling system to compute human and/or ecological health risk from exposure to the UXO and therefore allows site planning and management to be adjusted for range sustainment and future training needs. An added benefit of using ARAMS is that it inherently allows uncertainty to be performed on the UXO model’s input parameters. This paper describes both the development of a model to predict the source quantity of UXO and an example human health risk characterization that shows how the model can be readily used to characterize human health risks associated with exposure to UXO which range management could then use to plan future training activities...|$|E

The common objective of the PEIS and the BEMR is to provide the public with information about the environmental contamination problems associated with major DOE facilities across the country, and to assess the relative risks that radiological and hazardous contaminants pose to the public, onsite workers, and the environment. Environmental setting information consists of the site-specific data required to model (using the Multimedia Environmental <b>Pollutant</b> <b>Assessment</b> System) the atmospheric, groundwater, and surface water transport of contaminants within and near the boundaries of the installations. The environmental settings data describes the climate, atmospheric dispersion, hydrogeology, and surface water characteristics of the installations.

MEPAS analyzes pollutant behavior in various media (air, soil, groundwater and surface water) and estimates transport through and between media and exposure and impacts to the environment, to the maximum individual, and to populations. MEPAS includes 25 exposure pathway models, a database with information on more than 650 contaminants, and a sensitivity module that allows for uncertainty analysis. Four major transport pathways are considered in MEPAS: groundwater, overland, surface water, and atmospheric. This report describes the exposure pathway and health impact assessment component of MEPAS, which provides an estimate of health impacts to selected individuals and populations from exposure to pollutants. The exposure pathway analysis starts with pollutant concentration in a transport medium and estimates the average daily dose to exposed individuals from contact with the transport medium or a secondary medium contaminated by the transport medium. The average daily dose is then used to estimate a measure of health impact appropriate {{to the type of}} pollutant considered. Discussions of the exposure pathway models include the assumptions and equations used to convert the transport medium concentrations to exposure medium concentrations. The discussion for a given exposure pathway defines the transport pathways leading to the exposure, the special processes considered in determining the pollutant concentration in the exposure medium, and the exposure model used to estimate the average daily dose. Models for the exposure pathway and health impact assessments require definition of several parameters. A summary of the notation used for these parameters is provided...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{home is the}} {{predominant}} environment for exposure to many environmental irritants such as air pollutants and allergens. Exposure to common indoor irritants including volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde and nitrogen dioxide, may {{increase the risk of}} snoring for children. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate domestic environmental factors associated with snoring in children. Methods A school-based respiratory survey was administered during March and April of 2002. Nine hundred and ninety six children from four primary schools within the Perth metropolitan area were recruited for the study. A sub-group of 88 children aged 4 – 6 years were further selected from this sample for domestic air <b>pollutant</b> <b>assessment.</b> Results The prevalences of infrequent snoring and habitual snoring in primary school children were 24. 9 % and 15. 2 % respectively. Passive smoking was found to be a significant risk factor for habitual snoring (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 77; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 20 – 2. 61), while having pets at home appeared to be protective against habitual snoring (OR = 0. 58; 95 % CI: 0. 37 – 0. 92). Domestic pollutant assessments showed that the prevalence of snoring was significantly associated with exposure to nitrogen dioxide during winter. Relative to the low exposure category (3), the adjusted ORs of snoring by children with medium (30 – 60 μg/m 3) and high exposures (> 60 μg/m 3) to NO 2 were 2. 5 (95 % CI: 0. 7 – 8. 7) and 4. 5 (95 % CI: 1. 4 – 14. 3) respectively. The corresponding linear dose-response trend was also significant (P = 0. 011). Conclusion Snoring is common in primary school children. Domestic environments may play a significant role in the increased prevalence of snoring. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide in domestic environment is associated with snoring in children. </p...|$|E

The steady influx of acute cases were managed effectively and involved all neighboring hospitals, without evoking any "Major Incident Plan". Three groups of factors are implicated as causes of TAA: pollutants (aerobiologic or chemical) and meteorological conditions. Aerobiological pollutants include air-borne allergens: pollen and spores of molds. Their asthma-inducing effect is augmented during thunderstorms. Chemical pollutants include greenhouse gases, heavy metals, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, fumes from engines and particulate matter. Their relation to rain-associated asthma is mediated by sulfuric and nitric acid. Outbreaks of non-epidemic asthma are associated with high rainfall, drop in maximum air temperature and pressure, lightning strikes and increased humidity. Thunderstorm can cause all of these {{and it seems to}} be related to the onset of asthma epidemic. Patients in epidemics of TAA are usually young atopic adults not on prophylaxis steroid inhalers. The epidemic is usually their first known attack. These features are consistent with the hypothesis that TAA is related to both aero-allergens and weather effects. Subjects allergic to pollen who are in the path of thunderstorm can inhale air loaded with pollen allergen and so have acute asthmatic response. TAA runs a benign course Doctors should be aware of this phenomenon and the potential outbreak of asthma during heavy rains. A & E departments and ICU should be alert for possible rush of asthmatic admissions and reinforce ventilators and requirements of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. Scientific approach should be adopted to investigate such outbreaks in the future and must include meteorological, bio-aerosole pollutants and chemical <b>pollutant</b> <b>assessment.</b> Regional team work is mandatory...|$|E

40|$|A lot of {{emphasis}} {{has been placed}} on the safety of drinking water from biological contamination with little consideration on the chemical quality although there are well known health risks associated with the consumption of groundwater with high levels of chemical <b>pollutants.</b> An <b>assessment</b> of the chemical quality of groundwater was done in Kachindamoto Traditional Authority area, in Dedza district of Malawi. The area was chosen because of the reported occurrence of salty water in some places. The main {{purpose of the study was}} to determine the chemical quality of groundwater and to compare it to the Malawi Bureau of Standards (MBS) and the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Development (MoIWD) Standards and identify critical areas and possible interventions. Samples were collected from 48 groundwater points and analysed for selected water quality parameters. Field tests were carried out for pH, conductivity and temperature while TDS, carbonate, bicarbonate, chloride, sulphates, nitrate, fluoride, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese, total hardness, total alkalinity and silica were analysed in a laboratory. It was found out that most parameters (75...|$|R
