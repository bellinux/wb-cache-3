OpenSSL is a candidate {{to become the first}} recipient of the initiative's funding.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{rebuilt the}} defence for 1993–94, signing right-back Brian Mitchell and centre-back David Thompson, and oversaw a mixed {{start to the}} season. City won four {{straight}} home matches but also lost 5–1 to West Ham, 5–0 at Newcastle, and most significantly 4–0 to local rivals Bristol Rovers at Twerton Park. He {{found it difficult to}} control the club's talented and popular players, as Dziekanowski regularly got into trouble in his social life and skilled left-winger Junior Bent was unwilling to deliver crosses as regularly as Smith demanded. He tried to sell Bent but was unable to have the deal sanctioned by the club's directors. His relationship with the board was poor and he found himself regularly undermined and sensitive boardroom discussions were leaked. He also tried to sell Cole in order to <b>provide</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> restructure the first team but again the board refused to sanction the deal. He was dismissed on 21 January 1993 following a run of 10 matches without a victory, and his assistant Russell Osman was appointed as his successor.|$|E

Her wealth enabled her to give financial support to struggling writers, including Joyce and Edith Sitwell. She also helped with finance for Sylvia Beach's bookshop Shakespeare and Company and certain publishing ventures, and started a film company Pool Group.

25|$|The CBA {{agreed upon}} in 1993 was {{extended}} again in 2006 after the team owners agreed {{to include more}} revenues in the salary cap and to increase benefits, including the first ever plan to <b>provide</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> players for medical expenses after their post-career medical insurance ran out. This extension of the CBA included an option for either party to opt out before November 8, 2008, which {{would have resulted in}} a termination of the CBA on March 1, 2011 if either side chose to exercise it. The team owners voted unanimously to opt out in May 2008.|$|E
25|$|Military {{expenses}} {{placed a}} considerable {{strain on the}} King's revenues. In response, Richelieu raised the gabelle (salt tax) and the taille (land tax). The taille was enforced to <b>provide</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> raise armies and wage war. The clergy, nobility, and high bourgeoisie were either exempt or could easily avoid payment, so the burden fell on the poorest segment of the nation. To collect taxes more efficiently, and to keep corruption to a minimum, Richelieu bypassed local tax officials, replacing them with intendants (officials in the direct service of the Crown). Richelieu's financial scheme, however, caused unrest among the peasants; there were several uprisings in 1636 to 1639. Richelieu crushed the revolts violently, and dealt with the rebels harshly.|$|E

25|$|Some {{historians have}} alleged that Tayloe {{may have been}} a spy for the Confederate States of America during the Civil War. William Tidwell and others point out that he was a noted Southern sympathizer, and that he had the education, skill, connections, and opportunity. Tidwell has even alleged that Tayloe met with John B. Magruder and George Washington Custis Lee (son of Robert E. Lee), both men later to be generals in the Confederate States Army, on April 21, 1861—the day before Robert E. Lee left Washington, D.C., to join the rebel armies. This left Tayloe in charge of a secret espionage ring in the city, it is claimed. Tayloe may also have helped <b>provide</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> Confederate prisoners housed at the Old Capitol Prison in the city. It is even claimed that Tayloe may have helped {{conceive}} the kidnapping plot which later became a plan to kill President Lincoln.|$|E
25|$|Dizengoff became head of {{the town}} {{planning}} in 1911, a position that he held until 1922. When Tel Aviv was recognized as a city, Dizengoff was elected mayor. He remained in office until his death, apart from a three-year hiatus in 1925-1928. During World War I, the Ottomans drove out {{a large part of}} the population and Dizengoff was the liaison between the exiles and the Ottoman authorities. In this position he dealt with aid sent to the exiles of Tel Aviv and received the nickname Reish Galuta. He widely circulated and publicised the plight of the exiles, mainly via newspapers, and succeeded in convincing the rulers to agree to a regular supply of food and provisions to the exiles. In 1917, after having received funding from Nili, Dizengoff refused not only to <b>provide</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> free Nili member Yosef Lishansky, but even funds to provide the succor that Dizengoff provided other prisoners and even anti-Zionists, despite having received the money from Nili.|$|E
25|$|On March 12, 2014, U.S. Senator Robert Menendez {{introduced}} the Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014 (S. 2124; 113th Congress), {{a bill that}} would <b>provide</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> implement a U.S. quota increase at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), rescind other funds previously appropriated for the IMF, and provide or authorize various forms of assistance to Ukraine and the surrounding region. It would require sanctions on individuals responsible for violence, corruption, human rights abuses, or undermining stability in Ukraine, and would authorize sanctions on certain individuals in Russia. On March 24, 2014, the Senate voted 78-17 to advance the bill to floor consideration. Consideration of the bill was withdrawn, however, the next day, after a decision by Majority Leader Harry Reid. Instead of continuing with this bill and it's controversial International Monetary Fund provisions, the Senate was to take up a House-passed bill already offering Ukraine loan guarantees, amending it to add sanctions provisions.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{his arrival}} in the Colony of New South Wales at the {{beginning}} of 1810, Governor Macquarie discovered that the Sydney Cove's hospital was an affair of tents and temporary buildings. Macquarie set aside land on {{the western edge of the}} Government Domain for a new hospital and created a new road – Macquarie Street – to provide access to it. Plans were drawn up but the British Government refused to <b>provide</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> build the hospital. Consequently, Macquarie entered into a contract with a consortium of businessmenGarnham Blaxcell, Alexander Riley and, later, D'Arcy Wentworthto erect the new hospital. They were to receive convict labour and supplies and a monopoly on rum imports from which they expected to recoup the cost of the building and gain considerable profits. The contract allowed them to import 45,000 (later increased to 60,000) gallons of rum to sell to colonists and was signed on 6 November 1810. In the event, the hospital did not turn out to be very profitable for the contractors. Convict patients were transferred to Governor Macquarie’s new hospital in 1816.|$|E

500|$|North was {{approached}} by King Leopold II of Belgium at a horse racing event to <b>provide</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> establish a concession company to extract rubber from the Congo Free State. [...] North agreed and provided GBP£40,000 of the BEF250,000 initial investment {{to set up the}} Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company (ABIR) at Antwerp on 6 August 1892. [...] ABIR had exclusive rights to all forest products from the Maringa-Lopori basin for 30 years and had police powers within the limits of the concession to enforce the collection of rubber as a tax. [...] The company was initially very successful but by 1898, two years after North's death, his heirs had sold his shares in the company. [...] The company later became infamous for human rights abuses of the inhabitants of its concession and fell into financial troubles.|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1843, the Tyler {{administration}} had sent executive agent Duff Green to Europe to gather intelligence and arrange territorial treaty talks with Great Britain regarding Oregon; he also worked with American minister to France, Lewis Cass, to thwart efforts by major European powers to suppress the maritime slave trade. Green reported to Secretary Upshur in July 1843 that he had discovered a [...] "loan plot" [...] by American abolitionists, in league with Lord Aberdeen, British Foreign Secretary, to <b>provide</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> the Texas {{in exchange for the}} emancipation of its slaves. Minister Everett was charged with determining the substance of these confidential reports alleging a Texas plot. His investigations, including personal interviews with Lord Aberdeen, concluded that British interest in abolitionist intrigues was weak, contradicting Secretary of State Upshur's conviction that Great Britain was manipulating Texas. Though unsubstantiated, Green's unofficial intelligence so alarmed Tyler that he requested verification from the US minister to Mexico, Waddy Thompson.|$|E

Furthermore, the [...] vaccine had to be made to a patient's exact needs, making it more labour-intensive, time-consuming and expensive.|$|E

2500|$|Modern Monetary Theory (MMT or Modern Money Theory, {{also known}} as Neo-Chartalism) is a {{macroeconomic}} theory that describes and analyses modern economies in which the national currency is fiat money, established and created by the government.
