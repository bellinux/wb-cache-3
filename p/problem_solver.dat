40|$|The {{critical}} thinking skills of chemistry students are usually inferred from their ability to solve problems. Thus, {{a better understanding of}} {{critical thinking}} skills is achieved through studying problem-solving behavior. An essential component of problem solving is the construction of a mental representation of the problem statement. This study was primarily concerned with the characterization of the representations constructed by successful and unsuccessful <b>problem</b> <b>solvers.</b> ^ A mixed-methodology (qualitative and quantitative data) approach was taken. Analysis of the data revealed that successful <b>problem</b> <b>solvers</b> tended to construct significantly more representations (n = 72, t = 2. 01, p 3 ̆c. 05) than unsuccessful <b>problem</b> <b>solvers.</b> The representations constructed by the two groups were also different. Successful <b>problem</b> <b>solvers</b> tended to construct verbal-symbolic representation; unsuccessful <b>problem</b> <b>solvers</b> tended to construct verbal-propositional representations. The representations constructed by successful <b>problem</b> <b>solvers</b> more closely resembled the information presented in the instruction, contained less superfluous information, and were usually more complete than the representations constructed by unsuccessful <b>problem</b> <b>solvers.</b> ...|$|R

We suffer from numerous biases, shortcomings, and constraints (Dawes 1988 and Nisbett and Ross 1980). Yet, we often locate good, or even optimal decisions to difficult, i. e. multi [...] dimensional and highly nonlinear, problems.

40|$|We {{construct}} {{a model of}} problem solving by heterogeneous agents with limited abilities. Heterogeneity refers not to variations in preferences but to differences in how individual <b>problem</b> <b>solvers</b> perceive <b>problems</b> and in how they attempt to solve them. These differences enable a collection of diverse <b>problem</b> <b>solvers</b> to outperform individuals. The main result of the paper addresses the benefits of diversity: agents possessing limited abilities can collectively locate optimal solutions to difficult problems. We also arrive at some uncomfortable conclusions about returns to adding additional <b>problem</b> <b>solvers.</b> We find that arbitrary returns to additional <b>problem</b> <b>solvers</b> are possible and that a team of people of "equal ability" applied to a single problem might exhibit increasing returns or decreasing returns depending upon {{the order in which}} they are hired.

2500|$|Simon was {{a pioneer}} in the field of {{artificial}} intelligence, creating with Allen Newell the Logic Theory Machine (1956) and the General <b>Problem</b> <b>Solver</b> (GPS) (1957) programs. GPS may possibly be the first method developed for separating problem solving strategy from information about particular problems. Both programs were developed using the Information Processing Language (IPL) (1956) developed by Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Simon. Donald Knuth mentions the development of list processing in IPL, with the linked list originally called [...] "NSS memory" [...] for its inventors.

40|$|The way {{knowledge}} is organized in memory is generally expected {{to relate to}} the degree of success in problem solving. In the present study, we investigated whether good novice <b>problem</b> <b>solvers</b> have their knowledge arranged around problem types {{to a greater extent than}} poor <b>problem</b> <b>solvers</b> have. In the subject of physics (electricity and magnetism), 12 problem types were distinguished according to their underlying physics principles. For each problem type, a set of elements of knowledge containing characteristics of the problem situation, declarative knowledge, and procedural knowledge was constructed. All of the resulting 65 elements were printed on cards, and first-year university students in physics (N = 47) were asked to sort these cards into coherent piles shortly after they had taken an examination on electricity and magnetism. Essentially, good novice <b>problem</b> <b>solvers</b> sorted the cards according to problem types; the sorting by the poor <b>problem</b> <b>solvers</b> seemed to be determined to a greater extent by the surface characteristics of the elements. We concluded than an organization of knowledge around problem types might be highly conducive to good performance in problem solving by novice <b>problem</b> <b>solvers...</b>|$|R
