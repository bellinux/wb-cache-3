The office regularly conducted soft skill workshops and pre-placement training programmes. Computer labs were available for conducting <b>pre-placement</b> <b>tests</b> for around 300 students at a time.|$|E

Dispatchers must pass <b>pre-placement</b> <b>testing</b> and a vigorous background check. Training is conducted within the district which they are assigned to.|$|R
40|$|Spirometry, or {{pulmonary}} function testing (PFT), involves {{measuring the}} breathing ca-pacity of the lungs. It is particularly useful in determining {{the presence or absence}} of ob-structive lung disease among exposed work-ers. Decreased lung function has occurred in fla-voring exposed workers before the onset of symptoms of bronchiolitis obliterans. For that reason, diminished breathing capacity, particularly among younger workers in the plant population, should serve as a signal to further investigate potential problems associ-ated with exposure to volatile butter flavor-ings in the work environment. Since decreased PFT serves as an important identifying factor of the pres-ence of the disease, it is recommended that all newly hired employees be asked to complete a health questionnaire. It should focus on respiratory symptoms or airway obstruction and serve as baseline information for sub-sequent annual evaluation. You may choose to develop one locally or use the model questionnaire found at the end of this document. This question-naire was the one employed by NIOSH in its Missouri study. Baseline PFT should be provided for all new workers before starting work. New workers who have pre-existing lung diseases or abnormal spirometry on <b>pre-placement</b> <b>testing</b> should be evaluated by a physician to determine the risk of exacerbating their lung disease from volatile flavorings or their ingredients. It is recommended that PFT be repeated on an annual basis, at least, for all exposed workers. Tests should include the ratio of the 1 -second forced ex-piratory volume (FEV 1) to the forced vital capacity (FVC). Workers should be encouraged to report respiratory symptoms or symptoms of eye, nose, throat, or skin irritation...|$|R
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this {{research}} work was developing and evaluating a model for supporting electrical engineering with e-learning. The model development {{was based on the}} survey data collected from representative teachers and students in Turkey whereas the model evaluation was conducted in the relevant HEIs in Turkey and the United Kingdom. To develop the model, the study investigated the attitudes of representative key stakeholders towards e-learning in Turkey by administrating questionnaires and interviews with teachers and students. Then the responses of the teachers and students were compared. Based on the results, I proposed a model with a multi-dimensional approach to e-learning: (1) self-directed learning by studying e-book, (2) self-assessment by solving e-exercises, (3) teacher-directed learning by attending classroom sessions {{as an integral part of}} the blended learning (4) teacher-assessment by solving e-exercises, (5) computer-directed learning by playing e-games and (6) computer-assessment by solving e-exercises. To evaluate the applicability of the model in different conditions, a case-control study was conducted to determine whether the model had the intended effect on the participating students in HEIs in Turkey and the United Kingdom. As the result of the case-control study, the effects of e-learning, blended learning and traditional learning were verified. However, there were significant differences among the groups. The overall scores indicated that e-learning and blended learning was more effective as compared to the traditional learning. The results of our study indicated that the knowledge increase in e-learners seemed to be gradual because they tended to study daily by completing each activity on time. However, the traditional learners did not have the same pattern because they usually did not read the core text and did not solve e-exercise regularly before the classroom sessions. The results of <b>pre-placement,</b> post-placement <b>tests</b> and middle tests also justified these assumptions...|$|R
