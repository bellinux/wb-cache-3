The popula-tion was high schoolboys and girls in Damghan city in Iran. Participants were randomly selected using a multi-stage cluster method (513 boys and girls) and they simultaneously completed three questionnaires: academic engagement, the <b>psycho-social</b> <b>climate</b> {{of the classroom and}} personality characteristics. Path analysis was used to analyze data. The results showed that the direct effects of personality characteristics and <b>psycho-social</b> <b>climate</b> of the classroom on academic achieve-ment were not significant. The direct effects of openness, conscientiousness and <b>psycho-social</b> <b>climate</b> of classroom on academic engagement were significant. The indirect effects (with media-tion of academic engagement) and overall effects of openness, conscientiousness and psycho-so-cial climate of classroom on academic achievement were significant, also the effect of academi...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to explain social relation based on <b>psycho-social</b> <b>climate,</b> psychological wellbeing components, and emotional intelligence among undergraduates of Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ogun State, Nigeria. The statistical population consisted of all undergraduates of Olabisi Onabanjo University. Participants were randomly selected with a multi-stage method. Finally a total of two thousand (2000) respondents participated in the study. The selection cut across all various levels in each faculty. The age range of the respondents is between 16 - 27 years with mean age of 21. 37 and standard deviation of 8. 33. The respondents consist of 1021 (52. 4 %) males and 926 (47. 6 %) females. Four validated instruments were used for data collection. The multiple regression method and correlation coefficient was used to analysis data. The result has established that psychological wellbeing (control of self and events, happiness, social involvement, self-esteem, mental balance, sociability), emotional intelligence and psychosocial climate were significant in explaining undergraduates ’ social relation. Also, It was found out that 18. 6 % of the total variance in students ’ social relation is accounted for by the combination of psychological wellbeing components, emotional intelligence and <b>psycho-social</b> <b>climate</b> of the university. This study concluded that when individual’s sense about connection with a positive social context is ‘ideal’, he or she is more likely to exhibit appropriate social behaviours...|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{and chaotic}} changes in market environments have caused {{business}} organizations {{to modify their}} organizational structures and social relationships. This paper examines the change in relationship between management and employees, which is shifting from an adversarial and controlling role to facilitation and employee empowerment. This paper's research question concerns how classical sociological theory would explain power redistribution within organizations {{and the formation of}} an associative and collaborative relationship which contradicts traditional paradigms. Traditional bureaucratic and contemporary organizational forms are compared and contrasted. Organizational <b>climate,</b> <b>psycho-social</b> components of underlying assumptions and group ethics are seen to be the mechanisms impelling transformation. Organizational change is driven by an emerging secular ethic. This ethic is embodied in an applied model of leadership and examined as an ideal type. The common ethic impelling organizational change is seen to be the same as that causing social transformation in both national and international spheres...|$|R

40|$|The {{authors of}} the article present the {{findings}} of the research conducted in a social organisation. The main findings reveal that cases of mobbing in employees’ interrelations have been recorded in the organisation. Moreover, the correlation (from strongest to weakest) of relations of mobbing in the employees’ relations and management culture have also been determined. The research revealed the mistakes in organization of management culture processes which prevent the achievement of a higher level of management culture within the organization. According to the authors of this article, after the implementation of changes in management culture, the management quality of all processes would also improve. On the basis {{of the results of the}} research, the authors provide the developed model intended for social organizations. The purpose of this model is preventive: it is designed to reduce the number of interpersonal conflicts, and also to facilitate conflict resolution and to improve <b>psycho-social</b> <b>climate.</b> The increase of the social competence of employees provided for in the model can be identified as a certain instrument, which allows the potential victim to avoid conflict, to resolve it independently, or deal with it with the help of the organization, which would spend less resources in this case and could allocate greater efforts for the implementation of its mission...|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} {{of social work}} at school existed in the Republic of Slovenia in the past (the period of the SFRY). This paper presents the findings arising from that period, the reasons for abandoning that practice (the problems of management and the achieved educational level of the social workers at that time), {{as well as the}} theoretical assumptions forming the basis for reconsidering the possibility of its reintroduction both to primary and secondary schools. This paper presents the different theoretical models and paradigms they rely on (traditional or conservative, reformist, radical, system-ecological and social-constructivist), with special reference to the social-constructivist model of social work, which is also author's own orientation. The suggested models and theoretical assumptions that social work rests on are associated with the domains of work common to social work and school, and those are: on micro-level, the realm of socialization (socialization process) and educational work related to pupils (common both to school work and social work), on the level of school - work on establishing the <b>psycho-social</b> <b>climate,</b> especially within peer groups, youth subcultures, the relation towards authority, the presence of violence and offender's behavior at school. Also, significant common ground in the paper stems from the concept of decentralization, on the one hand, and the fact that school is an institution that develops numerous functions through meaningful connections with the context of the local community and the society...|$|E
40|$|A {{juncture}} of interrelated motives decides {{always about}} {{the behavior of}} people in their working environment, their professional activity and the tendency to the effective performance, this forms their motivation understood as a process governing the selection made by an individual from among various forms of activity aiming at {{the achievement of the}} goals resulted from the values appreciated by the said individual. It is precisely that motivation nursing presently the fondest hopes. Filling it with the new contents and functions has to be the key to solving various problems brought about by the economic reform: it is expected to activate human attitudes, their efficiency and effectiveness, support initiative and ingeniousness of employees. Therefore enterprises are seeking those solutions which would be simple {{and at the same time}} stimulating to the efficient work. Those solutions concern mostly the material motivation i. e. improvements in wage policies and comprise such wage issues as: methods of qualifying and regulating labor,, forming the internal structure of wages, awarding wage promotions, and the selection of rational wage forms, relating the results of work evaluation to wages and conditions of their increase. These are the trends in enterprises, but no satisfactory results are encountered. Proper control of motivation calls for considering not only reactions of employees for pecuniary values and for improving wage policies and technics, but also for under taking paralel activities, aiding stimulation of the will to work and facilitating the use of human talents and resources, i. e. having regard for the conditions in which people live and work, which affect them creating given motivational situations (encouraging or discouraging). As regards an enterprise the said activities are: endowing work contents with intellectual values and autonomous functions, improving conditions of the material working environment, eliminating their burden and generating favorable <b>psycho-social</b> <b>climate</b> effecting a high culture of cooperation and mutual consensus among the people.

40|$|Four studies {{report on}} {{outcomes}} for long-term unemployed individuals who attend occupational skills/personal development training courses in Australia. Levels of distress, depression, guilt, anger, helplessness, {{positive and negative}} affect, life satisfaction and self esteem were used as measures of well-being. Employment value, employment expectations and employment commitment were used as measures of work attitude. Social support, financial strain, and use of community resources were used as measures of life situation. Other variables investigated were causal attribution, unemployment blame, levels of coping, self efficacy, the personality variable of neuroticism, the <b>psycho-social</b> <b>climate</b> of the training course, and changes to occupational status. Training courses were (a) government funded occupational skills-based programs which included some components of personal development training, and (b) a specially developed course which focused exclusively on improving well-being, and which utilised the cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Data for all studies were collected longitudinally by having subjects complete questionnaires pre-course, post-course, and (for 3 of the 4 studies) at 3 months follow-up, in order to investigate long-term effects. One of the studies utilised the case-study methodology and {{was designed to be}} illustrative and assist in interpreting the quantitative data from the other 3 evaluations. The outcomes for participants were contrasted with control subjects who met the same sel tion criteria for training. Results confirmed earlier findings that the experiences of unemployment were negative. Immediate effects of the courses were to improve well-being. Improvements were greater for those who attended courses with higher levels of personal development input, and the best results were obtained from the specially developed CBT program. Participants who had lower levels of well-being {{at the beginning of the}} courses did better as a result of training than those who were already functioning at higher levels. Course participants gained only marginal advantages over control subjects in relation to improving their occupational status. Many of the short term well-being gains made as a result of attending the courses were still evident at 3 months follow-up. Best results were achieved for the specially designed CBT program. Results were discussed in the context of prevailing theories of Ynemployment (Fryer, 1986, 1988; Jahoda, 1981, 1982; Warr, 1987 a, 1987 b) ...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to changes}} in {{education}} and schooling, {{with an emphasis on}} greater individualisation as a didactic principle and multicultural considerations, childcare workers are faced with new challenges. The theoretical part of this thesis presents the onset of the humanisation of children's hospital treatment in the territory of Slovenia, the hospital work concept based on aligning the educational and schooling objectives of the kindergarten curriculum and the specific adjustments of educational and schooling approaches to sick children. It presents the role of a childcare worker upon the admission of a child to a hospital in terms of identifying adjustment problems and mitigation of the consequences of hospitalisation, their role in the hospital ward and the importance of cooperation with parents. To perform high-quality work at a hospital, a childcare worker must have a clearly defined role. Therefore, through an empirical assignment, we strived to determine the experience, viewpoints and expectations of children, parents, healthcare professionals and childcare workers in Slovenian hospitals in relation to a childcare worker’s role in the hospital treatment of children. We used a survey questionnaire to research the opinions and perceptions of hospitalised children parents' regarding a childcare worker's role in a hospital kindergarten. The survey included parents who directly or indirectly participated in the child's treatment. The results revealed that before coming to the hospital, parents were not familiar with the educational and schooling kindergarten programme at the hospital {{and the role of the}} childcare worker. The comparison between respondents in terms of the similarity of their opinions and the perceptions of a childcare worker’s role in a hospital shows no statistically significant difference. Parents believe that the presence of a childcare worker in a hospital is very welcome and their role is to find a suitable way to console children in emotional distress and to include parents in activities and play that has a positive impact on psycho-social development. Parents expect a childcare worker’s role in the process to be understanding and supporting them as companions to a sick child, to consider the special situations of life that parents go through during child hospitalisation and to enrich the relationship between the parents and the child. The survey questionnaire for healthcare professionals was used to research the opinions of doctors, graduate health technicians and health technicians and their perceptions of a childcare worker’s role. The survey results show that a childcare worker is an important member of the professional team. Through the educational and schooling programme of the hospital kindergarten, childcare workers impact the humanisation of hospitalisation by identifying the adjustment problems of a sick child and influencing the <b>psycho-social</b> <b>climate</b> of the hospital ward. The healthcare professionals included in the sample believe that a childcare worker's role involves monitoring the child's emotional experience and ensuring the child's emotional stability, offering support for the child to mitigate distress due to illness and hospitalisation, and including parents in play with the child. Healthcare professionals have a varied opinion on the relevance of including all children from the ward in the educational and schooling programme. On the contrary, the parents of sick children believe that a childcare worker should include all children from the ward in the educational and schooling programme, even though a hospital school service is organised in the ward as well. The opinions and expectations concerning a childcare worker's familiarity with the specifics of the diseases treated at the hospital ward and the provision of various decorative items to create a child-friendly hospital differ in a statistically significant way among healthcare professionals. The doctors and graduate health technicians believe that the role of a childcare worker requires responsibility, the ability of autonomous action and the willingness to undergo lifelong learning. A standardised interview of hospitalised children revealed that the entire population of children treated in the ward takes part in the educational and schooling programme of the hospital kindergarten. The children perceive a childcare worker as a person they can confide in about how they feel and what they are thinking about the disease. The survey showed that children are keen to voluntarily take part in the educational and schooling programme of the hospital kindergarten. They feel good in the interactive relationship with the childcare worker despite the disease and not feeling well. This is confirmed by the opinion of the children who said that the things they liked most in the hospital were the play room, playing with other children and the childcare worker and the childcare worker's story-telling and creative activities using various materials. Open questions were used to obtain an in-depth insight from the hospital kindergarten childcare workers into their perception of the educational and schooling approach to sick children. The results showed that childcare workers base their educational and schooling approach on the job position – the approach in general paediatrics differs from that in specialised wards. Thus they indicated the differences in the educational and schooling work of childcare workers in kindergartens with healthy children. Their approach to a sick child is based on adjustment to the child's needs that arise from the illness and treatment process, and that impact the child's psycho-social development. The explanation of the specific nature of the educational and schooling approach adopted by the childcare workers indicates that their work is also tailored to the needs of the ward. The childcare workers consider the cooperation of professional staff in the ward a very important factor for achieving the common goals to humanise the treatment of children. They also believe that childcare workers in hospitals should be trained in efficient cooperation with healthcare professionals that require them to autonomously take part in team research aiming to improve the hospital stay for the children. One special area of a childcare worker’s activity that is subject to different rules than when working with children and represents an important factor in co-creating the organisational culture of the hospital kindergarten is cooperation with parents. In the opinion of the childcare workers, the high-quality and professional work performance of a hospital kindergarten childcare worker is influenced by adequate qualifications of the childcare worker based on a willingness to undergo lifelong training. The qualifications of a childcare worker in the interactive relationship with a sick child are based on the knowledge that arises from an awareness of the efficiency of educational and schooling effects in this relationship. The process and development model of planning requires a childcare worker to be professionally autonomous. That is reflected in their qualification to plan activities for hospitalised children. ...|$|E
