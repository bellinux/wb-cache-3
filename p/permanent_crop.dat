50|$|In Canada, {{the history}} of CI (Crop Insurance) begins in 1939 with the {{introduction}} of the Prairie Farm Assistance Act by the Canadian Government. This act provided <b>permanent</b> <b>crop</b> loss disaster assistance for grain producers in the Prairies and the Peace River area. In 1959, the CI Act was passed to replace the Prairie Farm Assistance Act and provide more adequate protection to farmers in all provinces. CI has been a key federal support program since 1959 aimed at helping to stabilize farm incomes against production related risks. The reason governments got involved in CI was because the market failed to provide risk management tools for farmers to deal appropriately with production risk. CI has varied little over the years in that it was designed on the basis of participation by both levels of government (federal and provincial) and producers, shared program costs, voluntary participation, provincial administration, and actuarial soundness in the long run.|$|E

40|$|In {{agriculture}} (in {{the context}} of this paper, the terms “agriculture” and “farming” refer to only the farming of crops and exclude the farming of animals), smart farming and automated agricultural technology have emerged as promising methodologies for increasing the crop productivity without sacrificing produce quality. The emergence of various robotics technologies has facilitated the application of these techniques in agricultural processes. However, incorporating this technology in farms has proven to be challenging because of the large variations in shape, size, rate and type of growth, type of produce, and environmental requirements for different types of crops. Agricultural processes are chains of systematic, repetitive, and time-dependent tasks. However, some agricultural processes differ based on the type of farming, namely <b>permanent</b> <b>crop</b> farming and arable farming. <b>Permanent</b> <b>crop</b> farming includes permanent crops or woody plants such as orchards and vineyards whereas arable farming includes temporary crops such as wheat and rice. Major operations in open arable farming include tilling, soil analysis, seeding, transplanting, crop scouting, pest control, weed removal and harvesting where robots can assist in performing all of these tasks. Each specific operation requires axillary devices and sensors with specific functions. This article reviews the latest advances in the application of mobile robots in these agricultural operations for open arable farming and provide an overview of the systems and techniques that are used.

Sewage sludge occasionally even contains traces of endocrine disruptors and other harmful organic substances or their metabolites which finally led to the ban of application of sewage sludge as a fertiliser in Germany within the next 10  years.

40|$|AbstractEconomic {{development}} in low income settings is {{often associated with}} an expansion of higher-value agricultural activities. Since these activities often bring new risks, an understanding of cropland decisions and how these interact with shocks is valuable. This paper uses data from Mozambique to examine the effect of weather shocks on cropland decisions. We account for the bounded nature of land shares and estimate a Pooled Fractional Probit model for panel data. Our results show that crop choice is sensitive to past weather shocks. Farmers shift land use away from cash and permanent crops one year after a drought and from horticulture and <b>permanent</b> <b>crop</b> after a flood. However, this reallocation seems temporary as farmers devote less land to staples after two periods.

40|$|European rural landscapes are {{currently}} {{going through a}} process of degradation. In some regions, degradation arises via the intensification and industrialization of agricultural practices. On others, it results from the extensification of farming or even from its abandonment. This process, which leads to environmental and cultural loss, has been raising concerns about the preservation of European rural landscapes. But, while some conservation measures have already been enacted, the preservation of European rural landscapes faces several problems. One of the main difficulties results from the lack of knowledge about the process of landscape change, as this knowledge is fundamental to control landscape evolution. Within this context, this work brings some knowledge about the evolution of rural landscapes in Interior Alentejo, a region located in southern Portugal. Interior Alentejo is currently going {{through a process of}} landscape degradation via the extensification and abandonment of farming practices. The main rural landscapes identified in the region are: forest, montado, <b>permanent</b> <b>crop</b> landscapes, and open fields. Under <b>permanent</b> <b>crop</b> landscapes are classified orchards, olive groves, vineyards, mixed farming areas and tree coplanted fields. This dissertation describes the historic evolution of Interior Alentejo rural landscape from pre-history to present times. This study reveals the emergence of each landscape type and their main changes throughout history. At the same time, it allows the identification of the main anthropogenic factors of landscape change, and corresponding rules of action. To evaluate the effect of the interaction between anthropogenic factors and the main ecological factor varying in the region (soil fertility), the landscape evolution in counties with low and high soil fertility has been studied separately. Cultural heritage, political stability, the market, policies, social structure, population density, and technology have been the main anthropogenic factors of landscape change in Interior Alentejo. Knowledge about their rules of action, i. e., about their effect on the landscape, might be used to predict landscape changes and to control the process of landscape evolution...|$|E

Basically, the methodology aggre-gates to the traditional land-use types the concept of patterns of use which includes the technological levels em-ployed in agriculture and animal raising and seeks to identify all productive activity in the rural zone, employing the association of different uses to define the mapping units. The results of Landsat image interpretation and statistic data analysis showed the predominance of maize and manioc among the temporary crops and the out-spreading of rice as a commercial crop. Banana is the main <b>permanent</b> <b>crop</b> and, in the planted pastures, the cattle raising predominates.
