5|$|Hanneman used a black Gibson Les Paul {{modified}} with a Kahler Pro tremolo and a Joe Barden Two/Tone Humbucker bridge {{pickup in}} Slayer's early days {{and through the}} Show No Mercy and Hell Awaits era. In mid 1985 he began playing B.C. Rich guitars, notably a Rich Bich model he bought off his band colleague Kerry King, which he subsequently applied various graphics to. His first Bich had a 3x3 headstock, chrome hardware (including the Kahler Pro bridge) and the <b>pickups</b> were DiMarzio Super Distortions. He and King can both also be seen with {{a second set of}} B.C. Rich's around 1986-1987, which had 6-in-line headstocks, black hardware and DiMarzio <b>pickups.</b> He also used a B.C. Rich Ironbird model more rarely. From 1987, he was seen using a custom made B.C. Rich Gunslinger with similar specs as his '86-'87 era Bich, shortly after he had the <b>pickups</b> replaced with two active EMG 81 humbuckers. In 1988 he began playing the famous Jackson Soloist that he would use constantly as his main guitar for songs played in E-flat tuning until 2001. It was originally shipped to him with passive Jackson <b>pickups</b> (probably a J-50 and J-80) and a JE-1200 mid-boost circuit, but the <b>pickups</b> were soon changed for EMG 81 <b>pickups</b> and the mid-boost circuit was removed as well. Around 1990-1991 Hanneman began using ESP guitars, he mostly used as backup for this Jackson Soloist and other tunings. He had his own signature model made, based on the specs of his original Jackson Soloist. In 2000, Hanneman switched to ESP guitars, which he used exclusively until he stopped touring in early 2011. ESP also gave Hanneman his own signature model (see below), which is still available for purchase. When touring, Hanneman carried six guitars due to the different tunings he utilized. Most albums such as Haunting the Chapel – Divine Intervention and World Painted Blood have E-flat tuning. However, albums such as Diabolus in Musica – Christ Illusion feature alternate tunings such as Drop B and utilizing seven string guitars. The first album, Show No Mercy, was recorded in standard tuning, while live performances of those songs were played in E-flat since about 1984.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} applications of samarium is in samarium–cobalt magnets, which have a nominal composition of SmCo5 or Sm2Co17. They have high permanent magnetization, which is about 10,000 times that of iron and is second only to that of neodymium magnets. However, samarium-based magnets have higher resistance to demagnetization, as they are stable to temperatures above 700°C (cf. 300–400°C for neodymium magnets). These magnets are found in small motors, headphones, and high-end magnetic <b>pickups</b> for guitars and related musical instruments. For example, they are used in the motors of a solar-powered electric aircraft, the Solar Challenger, and in the Samarium Cobalt Noiseless electric guitar and bass <b>pickups.</b>|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{with their}} {{previous}} albums, the group produced Sons of Soul entirely themselves. They utilized both vintage and contemporary recording gear in the album's production, including a Hammond B-3, Clavinet, ARP String Ensemble, and Korg and Roland synthesizers. Riley viewed that hearing music played {{from the older}} instruments affected their songwriting. For his vocals, Raphael recorded with Neumann U87 and AKG C12A condensor microphones, {{as well as a}} vintage RCA Type77-DX microphone. He used a custom five-string bass from a guitar and bass repair shop in San Francisco, as well as a Minimoog analog synthesizer for other bass lines on the album. D'wayne used a Microtech Gefell UM70 for his lead vocals and an AKG 414 for his background vocals. He played a vintage Gibson L6-S and a Fender Coronado guitar, modified with Gibson burst bucker <b>pickups.</b> Aside from his drumming, Riley played both Wurlitzer and Fender Rhodes electric pianos.|$|E
5|$|With Harrison's entry, the Quarrymen now {{had four}} guitarists. Lennon and McCartney {{suggested}} to Griffiths that he instead buy a bass guitar, but Griffiths refused {{because of the}} expense. The two subsequently convinced Nigel Walley, still acting as the group's manager, to fire Griffiths. Walley regretted the incident, {{and as a result}} gradually severed his ties with the Quarrymen. Around this same time, Len Garry contracted tubercular meningitis, and spent seven months in the hospital, never playing with the group again. This left Colin Hanton as the last of the group of Lennon's Quarry Bank classmates that originally comprised the group. In March, McCartney bought an Elpico amplifier with two inputs, and he and Harrison added <b>pickups</b> to their guitars, giving the Quarrymen an electric sound for the first time.|$|E

5|$|The basic {{component}} {{sound of a}} Hammond organ comes from a tonewheel. Each one rotates {{in front of an}} electromagnetic pickup. The variation in the magnetic field induces a small alternating current at a particular frequency, which represents a signal similar to a sine wave. When a key is pressed on the organ, it completes a circuit of nine electrical switches, which are linked to the drawbars. The position of the drawbars, combined with the switches selected by the key pressed, determines which tonewheels are allowed to sound. Every tonewheel is connected to a synchronous motor via a system of gears, which ensures that each note remains at a constant relative pitch to every other. The combined signal from all depressed keys and pedals is fed through to the vibrato system, which is driven by a metal scanner. As the scanner rotates around a set of <b>pickups,</b> it changes the pitch of the overall sound slightly. From here, the sound is sent to the main amplifier, and on to the audio speakers.|$|E
5|$|There were {{attempts}} to revive garage rock and elements of punk in the 1980s and 1990s, and by 2000, scenes {{had grown up}} {{as part of the}} alternative and indie music scenes in several countries. The Detroit rock scene included the White Stripes, the Von Bondies, Electric Six, the Dirtbombs, the Go, the Muggs, the Hard Lessons, Tally Hall and the Detroit Cobras. The city was also a crucial stomping ground for Ohio's the Black Keys. New York's scene included the Strokes, Interpol, Radio 4, Liars, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, TV on the Radio and the Rapture. In Los Angeles & San Francisco, the scene was centered around Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, the Brian Jonestown Massacre, the Dandy Warhols and the Warlocks (most of whom would later be more associated with underground psychedelic rock than the mainstream garage rock bands of the era), while bands like Silversun <b>Pickups</b> delivered a more poppy take on post-punk. Billy Childish and the Buff Medways from the United Kingdom, the (International) Noise Conspiracy from Sweden, and the 5.6.7.8's from Japan enjoyed underground, regional or national success.|$|E

25|$|The P-90's {{reign as}} the Gibson {{standard}} pickup was short-lived, {{as a new}} design of pickup, the humbucker, was introduced in 1957. Equipped with double coils, the new pickup boasted greater output and less hum, although with less high end response. This new pickup, occasionally named PAF, very quickly took over as the preferred choice for all Gibson models, relegating the P-90 to budget models such as the ES-330, the Les Paul Junior and Special, and the SG Junior and Special, such as those used by Pete Townshend and Carlos Santana. This trend continued throughout the 1960s {{and particularly in the}} early 1970s, where the P-90 all but disappeared from the entire Gibson range. By the 1970s, smaller single-coil <b>pickups,</b> mini-humbucking <b>pickups,</b> and uncovered humbucking <b>pickups</b> began replacing the P-90 <b>pickups</b> on Gibson's budget and lower-end models.|$|E

5000|$|The use of <b>pickup</b> in this context, {{slang for}} making a casual {{acquaintance}} with a stranger in anticipation of sexual relations, dates from at least World War II, as attested by antiprostitution posters.
