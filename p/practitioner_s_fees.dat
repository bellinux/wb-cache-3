40|$|Private {{attorneys}} are entering into contingency-fee based special counsel agreements with states, territories and tribes, to bring public natural resource damage (NRD) claims. Under this agreement, special counsel brings a NRD action {{on behalf of}} the public and fronts the litigation costs, but deducts a percentage of the public 2 ̆ 7 s damage recovery to pay the attorney 2 ̆ 7 s contingency fee; the remainder goes into a fund to be allocated by the government 2 ̆ 7 s NRD trustee. Because NRD claims implicate gargantuan damage awards, the legality of depleting such a damage award by a substantial percentage to pay an attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fee</b> is a significant issue that compels public discourse and judicial review. This article concludes that such contingency-fee arrangements violate the express language of, and legislative intent underlying, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). Congress included fee shifting provisions permitting recovery for litigation-related attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fees</b> in other parts of CERCLA; however, Congress did not similarly provide a fee shift for litigation-related attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fees</b> when bringing a NRD claim. Such fees are simply not part of CERCLA 2 ̆ 7 s natural resource damage measurement. Moreover, Section 107 (f) (1) of CERCLA mandates that [s]ums recovered by the [...] . trustee [...] . shall be retained by the trustee, without further appropriation, for use only to restore, replace, or acquire the equivalent of such natural resources. Because contingency-fee agreements divert a significant percentage of the NRD recovery away from its intended purpose - natural resource restoration - to instead pay an attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fee,</b> such arrangements violate CERCLA 2 ̆ 7 s use restriction. Additionally, the legislative history of CERCLA reflects that CERCLA 2 ̆ 7 s NRD provisions are part of tightly-woven congressional design that contemplates a damage award sufficient to accomplish actual restoration of the injured natural resource. However, because litigation-related attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fees</b> {{are not part of the}} damage measurement, when governments bring NRD claims and improperly deplete the recovery to pay such attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fees,</b> the remainder is likely insufficient to accomplish natural resource restoration. For these same reasons, any attempt by special counsel to avoid CERCLA by bringing NRD claims under, and drawing the attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fee</b> from, state, territorial and/or common NRD laws, undermines Congress 2 ̆ 7 s carefully-crafted NRD scheme, and is therefore preempted by CERCLA. While this article concludes that contingency-fee arrangements are illegal under CERCLA as currently structured, the author recognizes that CERCLA is flawed because it fails to provide the appropriate financial incentives to facilitate government efforts to bring NRD claims. Thus, the author proposes legislative reform to permit the recovery of the government 2 ̆ 7 s reasonable litigation-related attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fees</b> and costs when prosecuting CERCLA NRD actions. Such reform will enable governments to bring NRD claims, and to lawfully recoup the litigation costs from the NRD award. Because CERCLA 2 ̆ 7 s present scheme does not permit payment of litigation-related attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fees,</b> however, the current use of contingency-fee attorneys to prosecute such actions must cease. Pending reform, NRD actions must be prosecuted by either salaried government counsel or, alternatively, special counsel paid a comparable salary or a reasonable fee, drawn from a lawful government appropriation...|$|R

40|$|Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is {{the only}} rule of {{procedure}} devoted exclusively to encouraging settlement. The basic operation of Rule 68 is simple. A defendant (but not a plaintiff) may make an offer under Rule 68 to settle a case for a specified dollar amount or other relief. If the plaintiff accepts the offer, the Rule 68 offer and a notice of acceptance are filed and the clerk enters judgment according {{to the terms of}} the offer. If, however, the offer is not accepted, and the judgment obtained by the plaintiff at trial is not more favorable than the offer, the plaintiff 2 ̆ 2 must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer. 2 ̆ 2 In short, if a plaintiff rejects a Rule 68 settlement offer and fails to beat the offer at trial, the plaintiff is responsible for paying the costs accruing after the offer is made. This mandatory sanction deprives a prevailing plaintiff of costs to which he would normally be entitled 2 ̆ 2 as of course 2 ̆ 2 under Rule 54 (d). Unfortunately, despite its unique status as a rule encouraging settlement, Rule 68 is seldom used and is widely considered a failure. There are three major reasons for Rule 682 ̆ 7 s present ineffectiveness. First, the rule can be invoked only by parties defending against claims. Second, the sanction of costs has generally been considered too small to encourage defendants to make Rule 68 offers or to encourage plaintiffs to accept them. Third, even when Rule 68 has been used, it has not led to early settlements because defendants generally have a greater incentive to earn interest on their money than to avoid plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 costs. Thus, many Rule 68 offers are not made until shortly before trial. All of this may be about to change. On December 5, 1984, the United States Supreme Court heard oral argument in Marek v. Chesny. 2 ̆ 2 In Marek, the Court is considering whether the term 2 ̆ 2 costs 2 ̆ 2 in Rule 68 includes civil rights attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fees,</b> which are defined in 42 U. S. C. § 1988 as 2 ̆ 2 part of the costs. 2 ̆ 2 Specifically, the Court will decide whether a civil rights plaintiff who rejects a Rule 68 offer and ultimately obtains a less favorable judgment at trial must be denied attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fees</b> for all work performed after the Rule 68 offer was made. Although Marek v. Chesny superficially involves only the relationship between Rule 68 and section 1988, the case may have a much broader impact. At least ninety federal statutes in addition to section 1988 allow courts to award prevailing parties reasonable attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fees</b> as part of the costs. If the Court decides that Rule 68 in effect incorporates the definition of costs used in the attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fees</b> statutes, Rule 68 will become an enormously powerful settlement tool in cases involving fee-shifting statutes. One third or more of all federal litigation will thus be affected by the decision in Marek v. Chzesny. Indeed, the issue is important enough for the Solicitor General of the United States to have filed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to hold that Rule 68 costs include attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fees</b> in cases involving any of the ninety-plus fee award statutes. The court of appeals 2 ̆ 7 holding in Marek that Rule 68 costs do not include attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fees</b> in civil rights cases rested on two grounds. First, the court of appeals concluded that defining Rule 68 costs to include civil rights attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fees</b> would have violated the Rules Enabling Act by abridging the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s substantive right to attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fees</b> under section 1988. Second, the court of appeals concluded that construing Rule 68 costs to include civil rights attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fees</b> would contradict the policies underlying section 1988.

The Senate Report on the Civil Rights Attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Fees</b> Awards Act of 1976 claimed that numerous pieces of civil rights legislation 2 ̆ 2 depend heavily upon private enforcement, and fee awards have proved an essential remedy if private citizens are to have a meaningful opportunity to vindicate the important Congressional policies which these laws contain. 2 ̆ 2 Noting that 2 ̆ 2 [i]n many cases arising under our civil rights laws, the citizen who must sue {{to enforce the law}} has little or no money with which to hire a lawyer, 2 ̆ 2 those citizens and their lawyers, acting as private attorneys general, 2 ̆ 2 must have the opportunity to recover what it costs them to vindicate these rights in court. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 The award of attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fees</b> is particularly important for those plaintiffs who win only nominal damages - a frequent occurrence in civil rights lawsuits-and therefore cannot pay attorneys out of their compensatory or punitive damage awards...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} 2 ̆ 2 American Rule 2 ̆ 2 regarding attorney fees did {{not allow}} for prevailing parties to collect attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fees</b> from the unsuccessful party.

Wilderness Society, which reaffirmed the American Rule and its limited exceptions, Congress passed the Civil Rights Attorneys Fees Award Act of 1976. In its wake, courts began awarding attorneys fees to prevailing parties. The Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Hensley v.

40|$|The tax {{treatment}} of contingent attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fee</b> arrangements {{has been the}} subject of much recent debate and litigation. Some courts and commentators conclude that a plaintiff must include the entire settlement amount, including attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fees,</b> in her gross income, while other courts and commentators conclude that a plaintiff must include only her recovery net of attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fees.</b> Because of the alternative minimum tax, the resolution of this issue may have a significant effect on the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s tax liability. In analyzing the issue, courts and commentators have focused on the assignment of income doctrine by inquiring whether, upon execution of a contingent fee agreement, the plaintiff should be treated as transferring merely the income from the attorney fee portion of the claim (the fruit) or the attorney fee portion of the claim itself (the tree). This Article explains that this focus on the assignment of income doctrine is misplaced because that doctrine does not apply to commercial arm 2 ̆ 7 s length transactions, such as contingent fee arrangements.

40|$|One of {{the most}} active {{disputes}} in tax law today is the question of the proper tax consequences for a successful plaintiff, a portion of whose taxable damage award is paid to his or her attorney pursuant to a contingent fee arrangement. At issue is whether the plaintiff is taxable on the portion of the award that is payable to the attorney. One aspect of this problem was resolved prospectively by the adoption of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, but the problem continues to exist in other areas. The United States Supreme Court resolved a split in the United States Circuit Courts of Appeals with respect to the taxation of contingent attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fees</b> in Commissioner v. Banks, but that decision provides no comfort for the plight of taxpayers because the government prevailed. Moreover, the attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fee</b> dispute is only one small example of a much larger problem. Instead of dealing with the root cause of the problem, the focus (both in the courts and in Congress) has been on whether to provide a 2 ̆ 2 fix 2 ̆ 2 for the specific plight of the taxpayers who have raised issues in court. The courts and Congress, like the Little Dutch Boy, may be willing to plug one hole, but the broader problem is a structural fault in the 2 ̆ 2 dam 2 ̆ 2 of the tax law system-namely, the improper classification of a significant number of expenditures as itemized deductions. This Article argues that the current list of nonitemized deductions wrongly excludes a number of items, especially some that are directly connected to the production of income. This erroneous exclusion imposes an unwarranted and severe tax burden in far more circumstances than the attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fee</b> problem on which Congress exclusively focused in the American Job Creation Act of 2004. The harsh consequences resulting from the misclassification of a number of items are exacerbated by the stringent limitations currently imposed on many itemized deductions; but even a repeal of those limitations, which is unlikely to occur, will not cure all of the harm that a wrongful classification causes. This author hopes that highlighting several examples of misclassification will induce Congress to implement a commission to study the entire classification system, rather than to rest on its laurels for solving one small part of the problem in the American Job Creation Act of 2004...|$|R
