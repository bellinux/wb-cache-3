5000|$|Reduce fan speed. For newer computers, {{the speed}} of fans can be varied automatically, {{depending}} on how hot {{certain parts of the}} computer get. Lowering a DC fan motor's supply voltage will reduce its speed while making it quieter and lowering the amount of air the fan moves. Doing this arbitrarily could lead to components overheating; therefore, whenever performing hardware work it is advised to monitor the temperature of system components. Fans with Molex connectors can be modified easily. With 3-pin fans, either fixed inline resistors or diodes, or commercial fan controllers, such as the Zalman Fanmate, can be used.

50|$|Changing {{the square}} wave as {{described}} above {{is an example of}} pulse-width modulation (PWM). Modulating, or regulating the width of a square-wave pulse is often used as a method of regulating or adjusting an inverter's output voltage. When voltage control is not required, a fixed pulse width can be selected to reduce or eliminate selected harmonics. Harmonic elimination techniques are generally applied to the lowest harmonics because filtering is much more practical at high frequencies, where the filter components can be much smaller and less expensive. Multiple pulse-width or carrier based <b>PWM</b> <b>control</b> schemes produce waveforms that are composed of many narrow pulses. The frequency represented by the number of narrow pulses per second is called the switching frequency or carrier frequency. These control schemes are often used in variable-frequency motor control inverters because they allow a wide range of output voltage and frequency adjustment while also improving the quality of the waveform.|$|E

The motors are newly developed three-phase asynchronous induction motors, rather than synchronous motors as in the KTX-I. [...] The motors are supplied by traction converters with integrated gate-commutated thyristor (IGCT) rather than silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) components as in the KTX-I. [...] IGCT was the most advanced version of the Gate turn-off thyristor (GTO) used for control of high-power applications at the time, {{and the use of}} ABB-supplied IGCTs as the switching element in the rectifier and inverter modules of HSR-350x converters was a world's first in rail vehicles. [...] However, testing found limited improvements in efficiency and noise levels, and problems with reliability. [...] Each traction converter consists of two parallel-switched four-quadrant converters, which function as rectifier modules by converting single-phase alternating current (AC) from one main transformer winding each to direct current (DC), a 2,800 V DC intermediate circuit, one inverter module converting the DC supply to the three-phase AC supply for traction motors, an auxiliary inverter for the supply of motor and converter cooling fans, and resistors for rheostatic braking that are also connected to the DC circuit. [...] The variable voltage variable frequency (VVVF) inverters are voltage-sourced with pulse-width modulation (<b>PWM)</b> <b>control,</b> rather than current-sourced with phase fired control (PFC) as in the KTX-I.
