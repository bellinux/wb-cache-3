40|$|In {{this article}} we {{describe}} a new method for investing in commodities. This method combines a macro approach designed for generating long-term returns to hedge expected inflation with a fundamental view on how commodities should perform on a relative basis. The macro based allocation strategically weights commodities by their risk contribution and targets optimal diversification, and these weights vary depending upon the changing risk environment and the business cycle at the macro level. In the near-term, fundamental views based upon the long accepted “Theory of Storage ” increase <b>positions</b> <b>in</b> <b>commodities</b> {{that are expected to}} outperform and reduce weight in those expected to lag. In addition, the very structure of the futures markets influences the way we need to trade. We make a compelling case for this Commodities Total Return (CTR) method as a far more investor appropriate construct than other commodity portfolios because it approaches commodity investing from all levels and from a market perspective. CTR seeks a total return that improves upon the long-term expected inflation hedging goal rather than accepting an arbitrarily developed index, and can add value from nearer-term inefficiencies in the commodity futures markets themselves. CTR is designed with the goal of offering these risk and return characteristics while still providing the same, if not better, expecte...|$|E
40|$|Objectives of {{the study}} In this thesis, I study the impact of financialization of {{commodity}} futures to their index and momentum investing strategies. I test if the return characteristics of long-only and momentum investing strategies correlate differently with equities, and if there exists time variation in these correlations. I also analyze the prediction power of equities volatility to the increase of equities and commodities cross-asset correlation. Data and methodology My sample covers the daily returns of the S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI), its sub-sectors and 24 individual commodities from Jan 1, 1991 to Dec 31, 2015. The sample is collected from Datastream. Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) process is used in estimating the conditional volatilities of commodities, and dynamic conditional correlation model is used in estimating time varying conditional correlations between S&P 500 index and commodities. The impact of stock market volatility to cross-asset correlation between equities and commodities is analyzed with OLS regression. Sensitivity analysis is used to recognize the high market stress during post-Lehman collapse period as an additional explaining variable. Findings {{of the study}} The {{findings of this study}} indicate that commodity futures returns have considerable time variation, where time-series and cross-sectional momentum strategies produce statistically significant returns during the whole sample period. Moreover, momentum strategies have less downside risk than GSCI, its sub-sectors and individual commodities. Momentum strategies do not take consistently <b>positions</b> <b>in</b> <b>commodities</b> with steep future curves and high roll returns, which indicates to the generic decrease of the roll-return component due to the financialization of commodities. The correlation between industrial metals, energy commodities and equities increased significantly from Sep 2008, and was exceptionally high till the end of 2012. During this period, their cross-asset correlation with equities became sensitive to uncertainty in the stock market implied by its volatility. These findings support the view that the financialization of energy and industrial metal futures has made them a satellite market of equities...|$|E
40|$|This article {{studies the}} {{relation}} between the skewness of commodity futures returns and expected returns. A trading strategy that takes long <b>positions</b> <b>in</b> <b>commodity</b> futures with the most negative skew and shorts those with the most positive skew generates significant excess returns that remain after controlling for exposure to well-known risk factors. A tradeable skewness factor explains the cross-section of commodity futures returns beyond exposures to standard risk premia. The impact that skewness has on future returns is explained by investors’ preferences for skewness under cumulative prospect theory and selective hedging practices...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at {{addressing}} the contingent sales price risk mitigation {{problem of a}} risk-averse firm which procures some kind of commodity from the spot market as the major input for production. The downstream buyer pays the firm following a contingent payment rule by which the exact amount depends on the input commodity spot price when the product is physically delivered. In {{order to reduce the}} volatility originating from the contingent payment, a multistage financial hedging strategy using commodity futures contracts is proposed. This approach allows the firm to adjust the <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>commodity</b> futures market dynamically. The close-form optimal hedging strategies are presented when the firm adopts the exponential or mean-variance utility to characterize the risk-averse attitude. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I {{examine the}} {{variation}} in the net cost of storage for five different commodities by using an ANCOVA model, based on arguments derived from the theory of storage. The net cost of storage is in this thesis defined as the interest adjusted relative basis, between the spot price and a futures price. The variation in this variable is particularly interesting, as it {{is assumed to be}} highly correlated with the convenience yield. Furthermore, I conduct a test for a structural break in the model after 1999, to see whether the increase of speculative <b>positions</b> <b>in</b> <b>commodity</b> markets have influenced the valuation of the convenience yield. This thesis also includes a discussion on the possible behavioral and economical incentives that different market participators might have to store commodities at a negative return. The <b>commodities</b> included <b>in</b> this study are CBOT corn, CBOT soybeans, CBOT wheat, NYMEX WTI and COMEX copper. The data set consists of monthly observations from March 1990 to December 2012. This paper contributes to the field of commodity analysis by presenting empirical proof concerning the validity of the theory of storage. As predicted by the theory, I find that changes in the inventory level clearly affects the relationship between the spot price and the futures price <b>in</b> <b>commodity</b> markets. The inventory’s effect on the net cost of storage is also found to be affected by seasonal cycles <b>in</b> the <b>commodity’s</b> supply. Further, I also present results indicating that the total composition of market participants influences the behavior of the convenience yield.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Until mid- 2008, prices for {{a broad range of}} physical commodities, from crude oil to crops such as wheat, had increased dramatically for several years [...] raising concerns and leading to a debate over the possible causes. Some market participants and observers have attributed the price increases to fundamental economic factors related to supply and demand. Others have suggested that the price increases resulted from speculation in the futures contracts by hedge funds and investors <b>in</b> <b>commodity</b> indexes. Like stock indexes, commodity indexes track the composite price of a basket of long futures <b>positions</b> <b>in</b> physical <b>commodities.</b> The indexes' investment strategy is passive, remaining the same regardless of whether prices are falling, rising, or flat. Two commonly referenced commodity indexes are the Standard & Poor's Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (S&P GSCI) and Dow Jones-American International Group Commodity Index (DJ-AIGCI), which are based on a broad range of physical commodities, including energy products, agricultural products, and metals. Since around the mid- 2000 s, pension plans, endowments, and other institutional investors increasingly have used investments <b>in</b> <b>commodity</b> indexes to obtain exposure to commodity prices as an asset class, typically to diversify their portfolios or hedge inflation risk. To prevent excessive speculation that could cause unwarranted changes in futures prices, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and futures exchanges place limits on the size of futures positions [...] the number of contracts [...] that a trader may hold. In agreement with your office, this report addresses (1) whether the federal law governing futures trading prohibits investors from using the futures markets to gain an exposure to commodity indexes, (2) whether the federal law governing pension plans prohibits them from investing <b>in</b> <b>commodities</b> through the futures markets, (3) how margins have affected the ability of investors to obtain exposures to commodity indexes, and (4) how position limits have affected the ability of investors to obtain exposures to commodity indexes. ...|$|R
40|$|Companies producing, {{processing}} and consuming <b>commodities</b> <b>in</b> {{the production process}} often hedge their commodity expositions using derivative strategies based on different, highly correlated underlying commodities. Once the open <b>position</b> <b>in</b> a <b>commodity</b> is hedged using a derivative position with another underlying commodity, the appropriate hedge ratio must be determined in order the hedge relationship {{be as effective as}} possible. However, it is questionable whether the hedge ratio determined at the inception of the risk management strategy remains stable over the whole period for which the hedging strategy exists. Usually it is assumed that in the short run, the relationship (say, correlation) between the two commodities remains stable, while {{in the long run it}} may vary. We propose a method, based on statistical theory of stability, for on-line detection whether market movements of prices of the <b>commodities</b> involved <b>in</b> the hedge relationship indicate that the hedge ratio may have been subject to a recent change. The change in the hedge ratio decreases the effectiveness of the original hedge relationship and creates a new open position.

40|$|Investment <b>in</b> long-only <b>commodity</b> {{index funds}} soared {{over the last}} five years. Some refer to this surge and its {{attendant}} impacts as the “financialization ” of <b>commodity</b> futures markets. <b>In</b> view of the scale of this investment—in the hundreds of billions of dollars—it is not surprising that a world-wide debate has ensued about the role of index funds <b>in</b> <b>commodity</b> futures markets. A flurry of studies has been completed recently in an attempt to sort out which side of the debate is correct. Some of these studies find evidence that commodity index funds have impacted commodity futures prices. However, the data and methods used in these studies are subject to a number of important criticisms that limits the degree of confidence one can place in the results. Several studies find little evidence of a relationship between index fund <b>positions</b> and movements <b>in</b> <b>commodity</b> futures prices and this constitutes a rejection of the first theoretical requirement for speculative impacts. The most recent evidence in crude oil markets also indicates a rejection the second theoretical requirement for speculative impacts—a zero or near zero price elasticity of demand.

40|$|Most {{studies on}} {{smallholder}} market participation decisions analyze crop or livestock market participation separately. However, in mixed crop-livestock farming systems, smallholders’ participation decisions in crop and livestock markets {{may not be}} separate as a household’s <b>position</b> <b>in</b> one market {{may be influenced by}} its <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the other. Where there is limited income from off-farm and/or non-farm activities, household cash requirements for crop production or household consumption are usually met by selling livestock. Similarly, livestock purchase is usually financed by income from crop sales. However, to what extent the <b>position</b> <b>in</b> one market influences the other is still not well explored in the literature. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the interactions of crop and livestock output market participation of smallholders, by analyzing the determinants of household market participation <b>positions</b> <b>in</b> both <b>commodities</b> simultaneously. Household level data collected in 2009 from 1075 sample households in ten districts of the four major regions of Ethiopia is used for the analyses. Using simultaneous equation models, we test whether the position of being a net seller in crop market is affected by the position of being a net buyer in the livestock market, and vice versa. Results show that the decision to be a net buyer in crop market is associated positively with the decision to be a net seller in livestock market. Similarly, the decision to be a net seller in crop market is associated positively with the decision to be a net buyer in livestock market. This implies that crop purchase is financed by livestock sale and excess income from crop sale is saved in the form of livestock asset. Thus, policies/strategies enhancing smallholders’ participation in crop and livestock markets in mixed crop-livestock system should pay attention to the production and marketing of both commodities simultaneously. market participation, market position, crop-livestock system, smallholder, Ethiopia, Farm Management,...|$|R

It is shown how regression techniques {{can be used to}} test for spanning for more general classes of utility functions, in case some as- sets are nontraded, and in case some of the assets are zero-investment securities such as futures contracts. We then implement these tech- niques to test whether a basic set of three international stock indices, the S&P 500, the FAZ (Germany), and the FTSE (UK), span a set of commodity and currency futures contracts. Depending on whether mean-variance, logarithmic, or power utility functions are considered, the hypothesis of spanning can be rejected for most futures contracts considered. If an investor has a <b>position</b> <b>in</b> a nontraded <b>commodity,</b> then the hypothesis of spanning can almost always be rejected for fu- tures contracts on that commodity for all utility functions considered. For currency futures this is only the case for a power utility function that re ects a preference for skewness. Finally, if we explicitly take into account net futures positions of large traders that are known to have predictive power for futures returns, the hypothesis of spanning can be rejected for most futures contracts. ...|$|R
