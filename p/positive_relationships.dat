A 2010 study found <b>positive</b> <b>relationships</b> between job satisfaction and life satisfaction, happiness at work, positive affect, {{and the absence of}} negative affect which may also be interrelated with work motivation. Since it may be hard for an employee to achieve a similar level of trust in a new organization, increased autonomy may also help improve retention.|$|E
25|$|Research on 'protective factors', {{which are}} {{characteristics}} of children or situations that particularly help {{children in the}} context of risk has helped developmental scientists to understand what matters most for resilient children. Two of these that have emerged repeatedly in studies of resilient children are good cognitive functioning (like cognitive self-regulation and IQ) and <b>positive</b> <b>relationships</b> (especially with competent adults, like parents). Children who have protective factors in their lives tend to do better in some risky contexts when compared to children without protective factors in the same contexts. However, this is not a justification to expose any child to risk. Children do better when not exposed to high levels of risk or adversity.|$|E

25|$|According to {{a popular}} science book by the {{journalist}} Daniel Goleman, emotional intelligence accounts for more career success than IQ. Similarly, other studies argued that employees high on EI perform substantially better than employees low in EI. This measured by self-reports and different work performance indicators, such as wages, promotions and salary increase. According to Lopes and his colleagues (2006), EI contributes to develop strong and <b>positive</b> <b>relationships</b> with co-workers and perform efficiently in work teams. This benefits performance of workers by providing emotional support and instrumental resources needed to succeed in their roles. Also, emotional intelligent employees have better resources to cope with stressing situations and demanding tasks, which enable them to outperform in those situations. For instance, Law et al. (2004) found that EI was {{the best predictor of}} job performance beyond general cognitive ability among IT scientist in computer company in China. Similarly, Sy, Tram, and O’Hara (2006) found that EI was associated positively with job performance in employees from a food service company.|$|E
25|$|Zeffirelli filmed his Romeo and Juliet {{shortly after}} {{completing}} {{work on his}} 1967 film The Taming of the Shrew, and had learned from his experience on that project {{that it was better}} not to include speeches made redundant by his vivid images. He played around 35% of Shakespeare's script, enhancing the focus on the two central characters and making them more sympathetic, while simplifying their roles to make them less tricky for his young leads to play. He tellingly juxtaposes the betrothal of Juliet and Paris with the Capulets' crumbling marriage. Yet the film is often noted for its zest for life and for love: the former epitomised by John McEnery's Mercutio, the latter by Leonard Whiting's Romeo. In contrast to Renato Castellani's 1954 version, Zeffirelli highlighted Romeo's <b>positive</b> <b>relationships</b> with the Friar, Balthazar and Mercutio. The way in which Mercutio physically collapses onto Romeo after the Queen Mab speech, and again when mortally wounded, has been credited with introducing homosexual overtones into the public perception of their relationship.|$|E

25|$|The Buffy series became {{extremely}} popular {{and earned a}} devoted fanbase; Willow's intelligence, shy nature, and vulnerability often resounded strongly with viewers in early seasons. Of the core characters, Willow changes the most, becoming a complex portrayal of a woman whose powers force her to seek balance between {{what is best for}} the people she loves and what she is capable of doing. Her character stood out as a positive portrayal of a Jewish woman and at the height of her popularity, she fell in love with another woman, a witch named Tara Maclay. They became one of the first lesbian couples on U.S. television and one of the most <b>positive</b> <b>relationships</b> of the series. Despite not being a titular character, Willow Rosenberg holds the distinction of having the second largest number of appearances on episodes of Buffy and the spin-off series Angel. Alyson Hannigan appeared as Willow in all 144 episodes of Buffy, as well as guest appearances in three episodes of the spinoff Angel, for a total of 147 on screen appearances over the course of both series. She is also featured in an animated series and video game, both of which use Hannigan's voice, and the comics Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight (2007–2011), Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine (2011 - 2013), and Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten (2014), which use Hannigan's likeness and continues Willow's storyline following the television series.|$|E

500|$|The {{benefits}} {{for children to}} maintain relationships with both parents have been repeatedly shown in research. [...] Children in joint custody arrangements often report greater levels of satisfaction with the division of time between their parents and children are also less likely to feel torn between their parents when compared with children who are in sole custody arrangements. In addition, children in joint custody arrangements report feeling closer to both parents than children in sole custody arrangements. Joint custody arrangements also appear to benefit the parents. Not only do parents in joint custody arrangements report lower levels of conflict with one another, when compared to those in sole custody arrangements, but joint custody is frequently related to more <b>positive</b> <b>relationships,</b> effective parenting, and lower inter-parental conflict; key factors that ensure a child’s well-being following divorce. However, {{it is important to}} point out that children are far less likely to do well with joint custody and sole custody arrangements when their parents used them as pawns or when they consistently witness their parents' frequent, intense, and ongoing conflict.|$|E

A <b>positive</b> <b>relationship</b> between plant diversity and productivity arose in the second year and increased until the fifth year. This relationship persisted throughout the remainder of the experiment, but the slope of the relationship remained constant at approximately 50 g/m 2 /log 2 [richness].

She discovers, as Cudjoe puts it, that her stereotypes of Whites were developed to protect herself from their cruelty and indifference. As McPherson states, [...] "Conditioned by earlier experiences, Angelou distrusts everyone, especially whites. Nevertheless, she is repeatedly surprised by the kindness and goodwill of many whites she meets, and, thus, her suspicions begin to soften into understanding". Cudjoe states that in Singin' and Swingin' , Angelou effectively demonstrates [...] "the inviolability of the African American personhood", as well as her own closely guarded defense of it. In order for her to have any <b>positive</b> <b>relationships</b> with whites and people of other races, however, McPherson insists that Angelou [...] "must examine and discard her stereotypical views about Whites". Lyman agrees and points out that Angelou must re-examine her lingering prejudices when faced with the broader world full of whites. As Hagen also states, however, this is a complex process, since most of Angelou's experiences with whites are positive during this time. Cudjoe states that as the book's main protagonist, Angelou moves between the white and Black worlds, both defining herself as a member of her community and encountering whites in [...] "a much fuller, more sensuous manner".|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} factor influencing a child's well-being and adjustment after divorce is exposure to positive parenting and relationships, followed closely by family economic stability. Children that come from families with low or contained parental conflict, effective and cooperative parenting, <b>positive</b> <b>relationships,</b> and economic stability {{are more likely to}} benefit psychologically following divorce, when compared to average children. A study that specifically supports this theory has found that adolescents assigned to a joint custody arrangement scored higher in behavioral, emotional, and academic functioning when compared to children who have been placed in sole custody arrangements. [...] Furthermore, children in joint custody report higher self-esteem and lower levels of behavioral issues and greater overall post-divorce adjustment as opposed to children in sole custody arrangements. However, a child's temperament and age have also been shown to have a strong impact on the child's development. Children that have easygoing, adaptable temperaments {{are much more likely to}} benefit from the transitions that they will inevitably experience from a joint custody arrangement. Furthermore, some commentators believe that infants and preschoolers are not likely to benefit from joint custody arrangements due to the importance of a consistent routine and the security of a primary attachment figure at that age. This belief is not the accepted and settled view of mainstream scholars according to the Warshak consensus report published in an American Psychological Association journal with the endorsement of 110 researchers and practitioners, many of whom are prominent international authorities on attachment, early child development, and divorce.|$|E
