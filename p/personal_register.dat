50|$|The system {{followed}} in government office is called “ Tottanham’s System”. There {{will be an}} office Manager who is otherwise called as “The Sarishtadar” will exercise supervision and control over all sections and the heads of sections. He must periodically inspect the Personal Registers and {{see that they are}} punctually, neatly and properly maintained. The Office Manager must check any tendency to delay and bring it to the notice of superior officer. He must also find out whether there is any indication that any member of the establishment is obviously unsuited for his work. If any serious delay or other irregularity comes to light, it is not a sufficient excuse for the supervisor to say that he repeatedly warned the offender or urged to deal promptly with the file that has been delayed. The supervisor's duty in such cases is to report immediately to superior officer as soon as he found that his own admonitions are not proving effective. Should he fail to do so, he cannot be held to have discharged his responsibility.The office system {{followed in}} government offices is called “ Tottanham’s System” It deals with all arrangements with regard to “routine work” i.e., to such branches of work as the opening letters, registering, indexing, fair copying and dispatching of correspondence, the receipt of papers into the record room, their arrangement in the record room to store in safe custody, retrieval when required and destruction when no longer required and so on. The manual describes various registers to be maintained in government offices. Some of the important registers are : Distribution Register, <b>Personal</b> <b>Register,</b> New Case Register, Fair copy Register, Special registers etc. All letters received in any government office are serially numbered and they are registered in the distribution register, duly indicating to whom and to which staff members such a letter is assigned for initiating action. <b>Personal</b> <b>Register</b> is to be maintained by every staff member, which will have complete details of all the letters he has received and the dates of action taken by him. Finally how this letter is disposed off is also indicated in the <b>personal</b> <b>register.</b> This is an important register to assess the performance of every staff member. Periodical Register is another register which is helpful in monitoring whether the reports to be sent to various superior officers are promptly sent. This register has the details of the periodical reports, their subjects, the periodicity and to whom they are to be sent. The special register will have details of important references marked as Special by Head of Office and to be dealt with separately.|$|E

40|$|Background: In 2002 Folkehelseinstituttet in Norway {{started a}} {{relatively}} large study of all the reported cases of malaria in Norway the last 25 years, between 1978 and 2002. As medical students {{we wanted to make}} a presentation of malaria as well as some preliminary results from this ongoing study. Material and methods: By analyzing data from The Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS) from 1978 to 2002, and the <b>Personal</b> <b>Register</b> System in Norway, we gathered information on patients´ birthcountry and date of arrival in Norway, the type of Plasmodium giving rise to infection, and in which country they have been infected. Background information on malaria was gathered from Norwegian and international literature and studies. Results: During the 25 years 1527 cases of malaria was imported into Norway. Vivax has been the most commonly reported plasmodium species (44. 4 %). Pakistan had a total number of 252 cases of malaria, being the largest single country of infection in the study. Other significant countries: Kenya, Tanzania, India, Ghana, Nigeria. A group of 45 immigrants were registered with malaria less than three months after their first arrival in Norway. 266 was registered with malaria more than one year after arrival. A total of 342 immigrants were registered with malaria after registration in the Norwegian <b>Personal</b> <b>Register.</b> Interpretation: Immigrants constitute {{a relatively large}} group of malaria patients in Norway. Emphasis should be put on further investigation on the use of prophfylaxis in this population and on more information given on risks during visits to immigrants endemic home countries...|$|E

As a writer his primary claim to fame is his Christian apologetics, {{in spite of the}} fact that he is well thought of in literary circles and produced several scholarly works. In the light of his considered Christian convictions, one would expect his poetry to voice a strong faith and confidence in God However, somewhat ironically, certain of his poems reflect his struggles and doubts concerning faith in an intensely <b>personal</b> <b>register.</b> Nevertheless, in spite of his ambivalent feelings towards God, he retains the certainty that God is able to transcend his human frailty and difficulties. The problem of faith is relevant in our own time, and it therefore seems fitting that we should examine certain of C. S. Lewis's poems in commemoration of the centenary year of his birth...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to study a {{possible}} social gradient for testicular cancer in Norway, and assess whether the gradient has changed since 1960. Testicular cancer has traditionally been considered a cancer of the affluent. The previous register-based studies are conflicting on whether there is a gradient, if the gradient is shifting and if there is a difference between seminomas and non-seminomas. We have used a linked file with data regarding social status from the censuses and data from the Cancer Registry of Norway regarding the occurrence of testicular cancer. We conducted a Cox-regression analysis of testicular cancer among all men >= 25 years when participating in the censuses of 1960, 1970 and 1980 and data extracted from the <b>Personal</b> <b>register</b> in 1990. For 1990, we did not have occupational data. The analysis was done for the following ten year intervals after each census. We found an increased risk associated with higher education during all periods in our study with an odds ratio over two when comparing the highest and lowest educated. Using occupational status we did only find an increased risk during the period 1981 - 1990, the period with both a large number of cases and occupational data. Even during that period, the effect of education was far more pronounced than occupation. The results were similar for seminomas and non-seminomas...|$|E

40|$|The witness seminar ”Fastighetsdatasystemet” [the Land Data Bank System] {{was held}} at Tekniska museet [The National Museum of Science and Technology] in Stockholm on 30 September 2008 and led by Sture Hallström. The seminar dealt with the {{establishment}} of the Land Data Bank System and the rationalization in the handling of data on real properties and land. The main focus was directed towards the computerization of the real property register [fastighetsregistret] and the land register [inskrivningsregistret] and the different challenges this computerization of the manual registers faced. The organisation to carry this out was the Central Board for Real Estate Data, which started its work in 1968. A number of important inquiries supported the development of the Land Data Bank System, mainly two Governmental reports: the Real Estate Registration by the Swedish Register Committee in 1966 and EDP and Land Registration by the Land Register Committee in 1969. In finding the final design of the system, there were some political and emotional disagreements. The reformation of the property unit designations posed a particular concern. Another issue {{was the fact that the}} system came to be a <b>personal</b> <b>register</b> and questions of integrity arose. The technical matters caused some problems as new technologies like database management systems and the use of terminals and data communication were introduced. However, the core of the system has been stable and adaptable to changes over time. A legally binding start of the system could take place in Uppsala county in 1976, followed by Gävleborg and Stockholm county. The complete changeover took longer than anticipated, about 20 years, but was agreed to be well worth it. Suggestions to why the process could run so smoothly are that the Central Board for Real Estate data was a small, manageable and independent organisation, as well as having strong and open minded leaders. The coordinate system and its applications have expanded rapidly, for example in the use of the Global Positioning System, GPS. The Swedish Land Data Bank System has attracted great interest from all over the world and staff from the Central Board for Real Estate Data has assisted other countries in improving their systems for real property and land registration...|$|E
40|$|Self-presentation {{through the}} {{creation}} of profiles and pages on digitally networked spaces is becoming ever more ubiquitous. In order to develop greater depth of understanding of the place of social media in our self-identification practice, my dissertation investigates the experiences of online persona creation by eight artists. Drawing on sociological and cultural studies approaches to understanding identity as performance, I tie current artists’ presentational and representational practices to historically grounded, socio-culturally constructed discourses of ‘artistness’. Through this connection, I argue that the creation of online persona has not radically changed notions {{of what it means to}} be an artist, or how artistness is represented and understood by audiences of fans or followers, but rather that digital technology has allowed for renegotiation of the boundaries of artistness that still draws from historical understandings of the role and persona of the artist. This shifting of boundaries, allowing for more inclusivity within the art world, is demonstrated by my focus on ‘fringe’ artists: those whose creative practice places them outside of the traditional art world and its existing structures of representation, distribution and consumption. The eight fringe artists who participated in this study are drawn from street art, performance poetry, craftivism and tattoo. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis drives the methodological focus on the experiences of the artists. Rather than a consideration of behaviour and habit, or what the artists do, this phenomenological approach allowed me to instead focus on what it is like for the artists to create persona, what drives particular types of representational practices. Using unstructured interviews, and online listening as an extension of participant observation, the artists’ narratives of experience are expressed through transcript extracts and screenshots: both are necessary to fully explore the nature of online persona creation. My analysis of the artists experiences has demonstrated that there are three somewhat distinct registers of performance with which an artist’s persona can engage: the professional register, where one demonstrates ones proficiency, experience, popularity, and professionalism; the <b>personal</b> <b>register,</b> where one connects with wider social and political interests and activities; and the intimate register, where one allows the audience in to one’s private world. These three registers occupy the same performance space, but are implicitly or explicitly for different segments of the digitally networked audience of fans, followers, friends and family. The complexity of the performance and reception of these registers is influenced by the shared nature of the performance space – where previously different roles would be performed for different audiences without reference to one another, the networked nature of online social media influences decisions of how much, and when, to share with whom. Interpreted here using themes of strategy|happenstance, specialisation|diversification, visibility|self-protection, self|others and work|play, the professional, personal and intimate registers of performance enable us to see the consideration and care with which each participant creates their artists persona. The experiences of performing the self in these three registers, as presented here, provides an insight into the complexities involved in creating online persona, while also demonstrating that this type of presentation of self is, in itself, no different from the types of role play and performance of self that has arguably always occurred in our physical world. Despite focusing on the role and performance of artistness, this dissertation speaks to the creation and performance of online persona more broadly.  ...|$|E

Subjects and Methods.  Data of 6, 588 new TB patients, detected in Moscow in 2014 - 2015 were analyzed, as well as CTs of 118 of TB/HIV patients, which were performed in 2014 - 2016. Results.  In Moscow, the absolute number of extrapulmonary tuberculosis patients went down by 67. 5 % from 2012 to 2016 (140 persons). In Russia and in Moscow, {{the number of new}} extrapulmonary tuberculosis patients tends to decrease and currently makes approxamtely 3 % versus  4 - 5 % in 2011 - 2012. Among HIV negative TB patients the part of those with lesions within pulmonary parenchyma made 94 %, and among the HIV positive it made 74. 8 % (p <  0, 05). As expected HIV infected patients prevailed among those suffering from extrapulmonary tuberculosis (4. 6 % versus 2. 1 %).
