40|$|To obtain {{information}} {{on the importance of}} psychrophiles in nature, 95 samples of soil, water, mud, and various foods were quantitatively assayed for their content of <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>bacteria</b> and fungi and also for mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria and fungi. Thousands to millions of <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>bacteria</b> were present per gram of soil and represented 0. 5 to 86 % of the bacterial population. Also, about 25 % of the fungi in uncultivated soil were psychrophilic. In stream and river water, <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>bacteria</b> constituted 16 to 47 % of the bacterial population; in lake water, 41 to 76 %; and in lake mud, 11 to 33 %.

30|$|In this study, the <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>bacterium</b> Shewanella livingstonensis Ac 10 was {{selected}} as a host for the simple biocatalyst. Ac 10 isolated from Antarctic sea shows optimum growth at 18 ˚C but cannot grow above 30 ˚C (Miyake et al. 2007). A gene expression system using the broad-host-range plasmid RSF 1010 and its derivatives are available in Ac 10, and proteins expressed at low temperatures have been revealed by proteomics analysis (Kawamoto et al. 2007; Kawamoto et al. 2009). We constructed the innovative psychrophile-based simple biocatalyst for efficient bio-conversion by recombinant mesophilic enzymes expressed in a <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>bacterium</b> S. livingstonensis Ac 10 whose basic metabolism was inactivated by heat treatment. We evaluated the activity of recombinant E. coli β-galactosidase expressed in S. livingstonensis Ac 10 and basic metabolism of Ac 10 when cells were treated by heat, and applied it to the simple biocatalyst for 3 -HPA production from glycerol by using Klebsiella pneumoniae dhaB genes. Although the conversion from glycerol to 3 -HPA is not multistep enzymatic reaction (pathway) but single step reaction, psychrophile-based simple biocatalyst will be applicable to in vitro metabolic pathway if it succeeds in efficient production.|$|E
40|$|The gene (icl) {{encoding}} cold-adapted isocitrate lyase (ICL) of a <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>bacterium,</b> Colwellia psychrerythraea, was cloned and sequenced. Open {{reading frame}} of the gene was 1, 587 bp in length and corresponded to a polypeptide composed of 528 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence showed high homology with that of cold-adapted ICL from other <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>bacterium,</b> C. maris (88 % identity), but the sequential homology {{with that of the}} Escherichia coli ICL was low (28 % identity). Primer extension analysis revealed that transcriptional start site for the C. psychrerythraea icl gene was guanine, located at 87 bases upstream of translational initiation codon. The expression of this gene in the cells of an E. coli mutant defective in ICL was induced by not only low temperature but also acetate. However, cis-acting elements for cold-inducible expression known in the several other bacterial genes were absent in the promoter region of the C. psychrerythraea icl gene. The substitution of Ala 214 for Ser in the C. psychrerythraea ICL introduced by point mutation resulted in the increased thermostability and lowering of the specific activity at low temperature, indicating that Ala 214 is important for psychrophilic properties of this enzyme...|$|E

Bacteriol. 85 : 177 – 185. 1963. —A temperature-sensitive formic hydrogenlyase {{has been}} found in a <b>psychrophilic</b> <b>bacterium,</b> strain 82. The enzyme was most active at 30 C, but {{completely}} inactive at 45 C. In contrast, formic hydrogenlyase in mesophilic Escherichia coli was most active at 45 C, and completely inactivated only at 70 C. The hydrogenlyase-forming system in psychrophile strain 82 also was unusually heat-sensitive. It was inactivated at temperatures above 20 C; whereas, in mesophilic E. coli, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella oranienburg, hydrogenlyase was formed even at 45 C. This heat sensitivity of the enzyme-forming system accounted fully for the inability of strain 82 to produce gas from carbohydrates above 20 C. Psychrophile hydrogenlyase resembled the mesophilic variety in several respects. It was most active at pH 5. 0. It was not formed by cells grown aerobically. It could be induced in resting-cell suspensions by use of glucose, formate, and casein hydrolysate as supplements, although several times as much glucose was required as for enzyme induction in strains of E. coli and Salmonella. The enzyme was formed best at pH 7. 5, which was somewhat higher than the pH of 6 to 7 for mesophile hydrogenlyase, and by cells taken {{from the beginning of the}} stationary phase of growth...|$|E
