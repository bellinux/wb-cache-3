30|$|These {{multi-port}} converters can {{be classified}} as electrically-coupled and magnetically-coupled structures. The electrically-coupled types are usually implemented with non-isolated topologies such as buck, boost, and buck-boost switching cells [9, 10, 12]. In these topologies, {{in order to avoid}} large buck/boost conversion ratios and to effectively handle the ports, the operating voltage of different <b>power</b> <b>ports</b> need to be close to each other. This constraint is the main drawback of electrically-coupled multiple-port converters [13]. In magnetically-coupled topologies, the energy sources are coupled through magnetic coupling (mainly high frequency ac-link), which provide electrical isolation between the <b>power</b> <b>ports</b> [9, 11]. In these topologies, because of the use of multi-winding transformers, DGs with different operating voltage levels can be connected to <b>power</b> <b>ports.</b> These converters can handle quite different operation levels of DGs and energy storage units, but with relatively complex structures and control systems.|$|R

5000|$|For the 2001 US {{model year}} (2000 {{calendar}} year), the VE was eliminated and the S model was introduced. The CE became the new base model offered in 5 speed manual or 4 speed automatic transmission and the sporty S replaced the Touring Package. The 2001 model year {{also got a}} slight refresh with the new front headlights, redesigned front bumper, auxiliary DC <b>power</b> <b>port</b> with a higher armrest (LE 4 speed automatic models), inside trunk release for accidental lockouts in the trunk, new controls for the air conditioner that had the rear glass defrost button relocated with a button for the recirculation of air, and round reverse lights. The 'sportiness' of the S model built upon the CE models with a gauge cluster with tachometer in a red/black theme with an outside temperature gauge, a charcoal gray and black interior, standard front fog lamps, color matched side skirts, color matched rear mudflaps, a color matched front grill, a trunk release lever next to the gasoline cap door lever (but not on the remote fob), power mirrors, a trunk light, 14" [...] 'S' model wheel covers, and lighted map lights on the rear view mirror. The S model lacked the 60/40 folding rear seat, or tilt steering of the LE model. The 'S' model had no performance advantage over the other models: it was purely an appearance package.

50|$|For the 1996 model year, the Grand Cherokee {{received}} a minor restyling {{to keep up}} with competitors such as the Ford Explorer and the Toyota 4Runner, both of which had been improved. The Grand Cherokee featured new front and rear bumpers, dual front SRS airbags, upgraded seatbelt safety devices, steering wheel-mounted sound system controls for some models, and revised steering wheel, now three-spoke with integrated cruise control buttons, a new dual-note horn, and the horn buttons were deleted in favor of a single horn pad which allowed the driver to press anywhere {{in the center of the}} steering wheel to sound the vehicle's horn. It was also given upgraded seats, an upgraded interior with new door panels and interior trim panels, a glove box that had more storage space, new tires and wheels, revised headlamps, fog lamps that were directly integrated into the vehicle's front bumper on some models, a new keyless entry remote, and faux wood interior trim standard on all models. An optional rear lift glass (first introduced with the 1995 Orvis edition where production tailgates manufactured after January 3, 1995 have both provisions for both fixed and lift glass) for the Laredo and Limited were added to the options list (the fixed glass came standard). The base SE model was dropped for 1996, in favor of new features being added to the Laredo (now base) model. The Grand Cherokee now offered standard power windows, power door locks, rear door child locks, cool blasting, keyless entry, A/M-F/M radio with cassette player and compact disc player and four standard speakers, cloth seating surfaces, and more. The manual transmission was no longer offered after the 1994 model year Grand Cherokee sold in North America but remained as the base transmission for European ZJs (ZG) sold in Europe with the diesel motor. New front door designs got new side body cladding strips, and the 'Laredo' subtext on the Laredo model was moved down to the cladding. The 'Grand Cherokee' badge was relocated to the front lower doors, and was now larger (using a font style similar to other Chrysler products), replacing the 1974-era American Motors font style used on Jeep vehicles. On V8-equipped Grand Cherokees, there was a new V8 badge on the rear liftgate. The 4X4 badge, on four-wheel-drive-equipped Grand Cherokees, was also changed to raised metal letters instead of the 4X4 decals offered before. A combination cassette player and CD player was available for the first time as an option, and the vehicle featured an OBD II diagnostics port under the dashboard on the driver's side, required for all 1996 model year and newer vehicles, a digital odometer and trip odometer, a 120 miles per hour speedometer rating on some models, and the vehicle now included some user-programmable features such as if the headlamps and tail lamps flashed when a button was pressed on the keyless entry remote, how many miles until service intervals, whether the horn sounded when a button was pressed on the keyless entry remote, and more. The overhead console was somewhat redesigned for the 1996 model year to improve storage space and feature availability. In addition to the cigarette lighter port, a 12-volt <b>power</b> <b>port</b> was added for cellular telephones, coolers, computers, and other devices. The ashtray was also removed from the rear doors, replaced by a solid area. The Limited model and Orvis Edition model both got chrome interior door handles.|$|E

In contrast, defects introduce uncorrelated local variations across these measurements that can be detected as anomalies in the cross-correlation pro-file derived (using regression analysis) from the <b>power</b> <b>port</b> measurements of defect-free chips.

40|$|Abstract—This work {{addresses}} {{the construction of}} a four-wheel, nonlinear vehicle dynamic bond graph model and its implementation in the 20 sim modeling and simulation environment. Nonlinear effects arising from the coupling of vertical, longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics, as well as geometric nonlinearities coming from the suspension system are taken into account. Transmission and (a simplified) engine models are also included. The modeling task is supported by a multibody representation where the parts are handled as rigid bodies linked by joints. The first step is the 3 D-modeling of each, chassis, suspension units, tires and joints, as bond graph elements equipped with <b>power</b> <b>ports</b> for physical interconnection. This is done with the help of vector or multibond graphs in order to exploit their compactness and simplicity of representation. These 3 D-units are later programmed as 20 sim bond graph subsystems whose assembling through the <b>power</b> <b>ports</b> allows for an automated, modular approach to the construction of the overall vehicle model.
