500|$|The Cure's primary musical traits {{have been}} listed as [...] "dominant, melodic bass lines; whiny, strangulated vocals; and a lyric {{obsession}} with existential, almost literary despair." [...] Most Cure songs start with Smith and Gallup writing the drum parts and bass lines. Both record demos {{at home and}} then bring them into the studio for fine-tuning. Smith said in 1992, [...] "I think when <b>people</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> 'Cure sound', they mean songs based on six-string bass, acoustic guitar and my voice, plus the string sound from the Solina." [...] On top of this foundation is laid [...] "towering layers of guitars and synthesisers". Keyboards have been {{a component of the}} band's sound since Seventeen Seconds, and their importance increased with the instrument's extensive use on Disintegration. During Roger O'Donnell's absence between 2005 and 2011, keyboards were not used at all during their live shows, and were not as prominent on their 2008 album 4:13 Dream.|$|E
500|$|Hunt played several instruments, {{including}} guitar, keyboards, drums, bass synthesizer, and {{the electronic}} drum. When he finished writing and recording the demos, Hunt began the album's primary recording sessions at Santa Fe Tracking Station in Los Angeles. With What Were You Hoping For?, Hunt pursued a [...] "harder edge" [...] and rawer aesthetic than featured on his previous work. He {{also wanted to}} explore a self-described [...] "gnarly" [...] guitar sound inspired {{by the work of}} Muddy Waters and The Stooges' 1973 album Raw Power. Hunt attempted the sound in the past, but encountered discouragement from management. He discussed his direction for the album in an interview for The Boombox, stating [...] "t wasn't necessarily punk music. It was more about trying to capture the growl of a cello. That to me is as nasty as it can get. That's a beautiful sound to me. When <b>people</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> distortion on the guitar, I hear the same thing with that growl of a cello." [...] Hunt wanted to take advantage of his newfound feeling of artistic freedom and lack of concern over marketability.|$|E
500|$|The {{cast and}} crew of The X-Files reacted {{positively}} to the episode. Gillian Anderson cited the episode as being among her highlights of the third season. She said the episode was like dessert, adding [...] "That's what kept it fun and that's what kept it worth doing all the time." [...] Chris Carter said of writer Darin Morgan, [...] "It's been a wonderful coincidence of timing, talent, {{and the success of}} the show, allowing it to stretch in a direction it would never have been able to {{if it had been a}} less successful or if it had been a younger show. Darin is a truly original comic mind. I don't know anybody in the world working in film, and that's what we work in here even though it appears on television, who has the voice Darin has. He is one in many million." [...] Co-Producer Paul Rabwin said of the episode [...] "An instant classic. One of those seminal episodes. You know, when <b>people</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>The</b> Twilight Zone, they say 'Remember [...] "Eye of the Beholder"?' Or [...] "Trouble With Tribbles" [...] on the original [...] 'Jose Chung' is going to be one of those episodes that is immediately revered." [...] Assistant director Tom Braidwood appreciated Charles Nelson Reilly's presence, saying that he captivated virtually everyone and gave everyone a lift, nicknaming everyone on the crew. Executive Producer Robert Goodwin said that the casting of Reilly was the most fun of the episode.|$|E

2500|$|One {{image from}} his Facebook page depicts Roof wearing a jacket {{decorated}} with two emblems that are popular among American white supremacists: {{the flag of}} the former Rhodesia (now known as Zimbabwe) and the flag of apartheid-era South Africa. Roof reportedly told friends and neighbors of his plans to kill people, including a plot to attack the College of Charleston, but his claims were not taken seriously. On June 20, a website was discovered called The Last Rhodesian (www.lastrhodesian.com); it had been registered to a [...] "Dylann Roof" [...] on February 9, 2015. The website included what appeared to be an unsigned manifesto containing Roof's opinions of [...] "Blacks", [...] "Jews", [...] "Hispanics" [...] and [...] "East Asians", as well a cache of photos, including an image of Roof posing with a handgun and a Confederate Battle Flag. In this manifesto, Roof says he became [...] "racially aware" [...] {{as a result of the}} 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, writing that because he kept hearing <b>people</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> incident, he [...] "decided to look him up" [...] and read the Wikipedia article about it. He concluded that George Zimmerman had been in the right, and he was unable to comprehend why the case had gained national attention. He said he then searched for [...] "black on White [...] crime" [...] on Google and found the website of the Council of Conservative Citizens, where he read [...] "pages upon pages" [...] of cases involving black people murdering white people.

What strikes me is the stupidity of England in supposing that she is dealing with a small nationality; when she is really dealing with a very large nationality. She is dealing with a nationality that often threatens, even numerically, to dominate all the other nationalities of the United States. The Irish are not decaying; they are not unpractical; they are scarcely even scattered; they are not even poor.

[...] Then everybody applauds, as a matter of course, and agrees that it must be so.
