If an energy recovery scheme is not employed, the inductor energy will also be dissipated in the resistance of the active circuit components. A circuit analysis has been performed in order to calculate the current profile from the PFN. A higher fidelity solution was achieved by accounting for the temperature dependent resistance of the rails. This information along with individual component resistance and inductance was used to calculate the distribution of energy subsequent to a single pulse. Detailed component heating information is important when considering the overall thermal management of the system.
