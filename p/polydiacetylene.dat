Four distinct diphenyl <b>polydiacetylene</b> polymers are produced from the crystal-phase topochemical polymerization of their corresponding diphenyl- 1, 4 -butadiynes. These <b>polydiacetylene</b> polymers are transformed into spectroscopically indistinguishable N= 8 armchair graphene nanoribbons via simple heating in the bulk, solid-state. The stepwise transformation of polydiacetylenes to graphene nanoribbons is examined in detail {{by the use of}} complementary spectroscopic methods, namely solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The final morphology and width of the nanoribbons is established through the use of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.

For these applications, high-quality thin <b>polydiacetylene</b> films are required. We have discovered a novel technique for obtaining such films of a <b>polydiacetylene</b> derivative of 2 -methyl- 4 -nitroaniline using photodeposition from monomer solutions onto UV transparent substrates. This heretofore unreported process yields amorphous <b>polydiacetylene</b> films with thicknesses {{on the order of}} I micron that have optical quality superior to that of films grown by standard crystal growth techniques. Furthermore, these films exhibit good third-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities; degenerate four-wave mixing experiments give x(3) values on the order of 10 (exp - 8) - 10 (exp - 7) esu. We have conducted masking experiments which demonstrate that photodeposition occurs only where the substrate is directly irradiated, clearly indicating that the reaction occurs at the surface. Additionally, we have also been able to carry out photodeposition using lasers to form thin polymer circuits. In this work, we discuss the photodeposition of <b>polydiacetylene</b> thin films from solution, perform chemical characterization of these films, investigate the role of the substrate, speculate on the mechanism of the reaction, and make a preliminary determination of the third-order optical nonlinearity of the films.

The monomeric diacetylenes are of general formula X-(CH 2) 9 -C triple bond C-C triple bond C-(CH 2) 9 -X, with X being a sulfate (1 a), phosphate (2) or pyridinium (3) head group.
