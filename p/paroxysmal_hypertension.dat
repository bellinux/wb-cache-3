5000|$|<b>Paroxysmal</b> <b>hypertension</b> is episodic and {{volatile}} high blood pressure, {{which may be}} due to stress of any sort, or from a pheochromocytoma, a type of tumor involving the adrenal medulla. Patients with <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>hypertension</b> who test negative for pheochromocytoma are said to be suffering from a clinical entity called [...] "pseudopheochromocytoma." [...] This disorder is due to episodic dopamine discharge and has been observed predominantly in hypertensive women, that had episodes that shared similar characteristics of pheochromocytoma but testing proved negative and had ruled out the tumor. In patients with pseudopheochromocytoma dopamine was found to be significantly increased post-paroxysm. The paroxysm is said to be similar to the hypertensive episodes described by Page. These episodes commonly occur after diencephalic stimulation. Therefore, pseudopheochromocytoma, shares many characteristics of [...] "Page's syndrome." ...|$|E

40|$|Recognition of the {{association}} of <b>paroxysmal</b> a <b>hypertension</b> with phaeochromocytomata, actively I secreting tumours of the chromaffin tissue of the i adrenal medulla, has resulted in the need for more d careful scrutiny of hypertensive patients for evidence of this disease which, if found, may be cured by surgical removal of the growth. Much help in diagnosis may be obtained by the trial of provocative agents such as histamine, or of blocking, adrenolytic drugs like " rogitine, " but false results are not uncommon and the diagnosis may be left in doubt. Following the demonstration by Holton (1949) that noradrenaline is present in the adrenal medullary tumours, Engel and von Euler (1950) reported that the excretion of the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline in the urine is markedly increased {{in the presence of a}} phaeo-chromocytoma and this is now the most reliable diagnostic method. Unfortunately, the com-plexity of the methods for determining these sub-stances in the urine has put them beyond the capacity of most clinical laboratories, and it was with the object of evolving a relatively simple clinical method that this work was undertaken. Two methods for the determination of catechol-amines are available: bio-assay, which is satis-factory but involves the use of an animal prepara-tion as a test-object for the pressor activity of urine extracts, and the fluorimetric, for which a fluorimeter of sufficient sensitivity has not, until recently, been commercially available in this country.

40|$|Pheochromocytoma {{occurs with}} a {{frequency}} estimated at 2 - 7 per 100 000 pregnant women. Unrecognized, and thus untreated pheochromocytoma {{is associated with}} very high (40 - 50 %) maternal and fetal mortality. Pheochromocytoma occurs sporadically or as a family trait. Its presence should be suspected in women with <b>paroxysmal</b> or established <b>hypertension,</b> especially before the 20 th week of pregnancy, accompanied by headaches and palpitations, and excessive sweating, muscle tremors, vomiting, anxiety, vasomotor disturbances and blurred vision. The variety of clinical presentations and rarity are the cause of not including the disease in differential diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy. Biochemical tests are essential in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, and involving the assessment of methoxycatecholamine urinary excretion. The second step in the diagnostics is magnetic resonance imaging of adrenal glands.

40|$|Catecholamine-producing tumors {{may arise}} in the adrenal medulla (pheochromocytomas) or in extraadrenal chromaffin cells (secreting paragangliomas). Their {{prevalence}} is about 0. 1 % in patients with hypertension and 4 % in patients with a fortuitously discovered adrenal mass. An increase {{in the production of}} catecholamines causes symptoms (mainly headaches, palpitations and excess sweating) and signs (mainly hypertension, weight loss and diabetes) reflecting the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine on α- and β-adrenergic receptors. Catecholamine-producing tumors mimic <b>paroxysmal</b> conditions with <b>hypertension</b> and/or cardiac rhythm disorders, including panic attacks, in which sympathetic activation linked to anxiety reproduces the same signs and symptoms. These tumors may be sporadic or part of any of several genetic diseases: familial pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndromes, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, neurofibromatosis 1 and von Hippel-Lindau disease. Familial cases are diagnosed earlier and are more frequently bilateral and recurring than sporadic cases. The most specific and sensitive diagnostic test for the tumor is the determination of plasma or urinary metanephrines. The tumor can be located by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy. Treatment requires resection of the tumor, generally by laparoscopic surgery. About 10 % of tumors are malignant either at first operation or during follow-up, malignancy being diagnosed by the presence of lymph node, visceral or bone metastases. Recurrences and malignancy are more frequent in cases with large or extraadrenal tumors. Patients, especially those with familial or extraadrenal tumors, should be followed-up indefinitely...|$|R
40|$|Background: Pheochromocytomas {{are rare}} catecholamine-producing tumours arising from chromaffin {{cells of the}} adrenal medulla or from extra-adrenal chromaffin tissue. About one fourth of {{patients}} with pheochromocytomas are carriers of germline mutations. The excessive release of catecholamines leads {{to a wide variety}} of symptoms. Pheochromocytomas are discovered due to the classical symptom triad of headache, sweating and palpitations combined with a persistent or <b>paroxysmal</b> arterial <b>hypertension,</b> which might also be missing. Imaging techniques and biochemical evidence of catecholamine overproduction help finding the correct diagnosis. Surgery is the core of an appropriate therapy. Methods and objective: An increasing proportion of pheochromocytomas seems to be discovered incidentally. Four German endocrine centres participated in this retrospective study. Finally, medical records of 137 patients with pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma who were diagnosed between 1973 and 2008 were analyzed. This study aims at investigating the circumstances of the discovery of adrenal and extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma and trying to specify the frequency and contributing factors of incidental finding. Results: There were no gender-related differences regarding age, time of diagnosis and clinical presentation among 134 patients with pheochromocytoma (49. 3 % women; average age 48. 5 ± 14. 8 years). The typical triad of symptoms was only found in 11. 6 % of cases. 8. 3 % of patients presented were without any clinical symptoms and 8. 5 % were normotensive. 36. 5 % of patients with arterial hypertension were without antihypertensives at presentation. Documented blood pressure peaks occurred in two-thirds of cases. Before 1985, 12. 5 % of cases were incidentally discovered, whereas thereafter the frequency was around 40 % (38. 6 % of the total study population). Patients with incidentally detected pheochromocytoma were significantly older (53. 0 ± 13. 4 vs. 46. 0 ± 14. 3 years, p= 0. 007) and often had less blood pressure peaks (38. 8 % vs. 73. 1 %, p= 0. 0002) than patients whose diagnosis was suspected on clinical grounds. There was no significant difference concerning clinical presentation, size and location of the tumour, as well as endocrine activity even if incidentalomas seem to be associated with lower levels of urinary catecholamines. Conclusions: Owing to better availability and accessibility of imaging procedures like CT and MRI, the number of incidentally discovered pheochromocytomas is increasing during the last decades. There is no significant difference in the prevalence of arterial hypertension compared to the suspected tumours. The lack of paroxysmal blood pressure peaks seems to influence the finding of the correct diagnosis negatively. Due to the potential malignant degeneration, every adrenal incidentaloma should be investigated concerning the presence of pheochromocytoma...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundParoxysmal atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) patients have a reduced quality-of-life (QoL) {{despite the fact}} that the majority of AF episodes are asymptomatic. Asymptomatic AF is likely to be associated with substantial morbidity and mortality rates similar to those with symptomatic AF, whereas its effect on the QoL has not yet been clarified. PurposeWe studied the specific contribution of asymptomatic AF episodes to reducing the QoL. MethodsWe assessed the QoL in 233 patients with <b>paroxysmal</b> AF and <b>hypertension</b> (age 64. 9 ± 9. 7 years, 71 % male) enrolled in the Japanese Rhythm Management Trial II for Atrial Fibrillation (J-RHYTHM II study) using an AF-specific QoL questionnaire (AFQLQ). The AFQLQ comprised 3 components: AFQLQ 1, the frequency and duration of symptoms; AFQLQ 2, severity of symptoms; and AFQLQ 3, limitations in daily activities and mental anxiety. Higher scores indicated a better QoL. Each patient transmitted electrocardiograms for 30 s daily at a predetermined time as well as whenever arrhythmia-related symptoms were experienced. We examined the relationship between the 3 AFQLQ components and frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic AF episodes (days/month) during 12 months of follow-up. ResultsThe symptomatic and asymptomatic AF frequencies were 0. 9 ± 3. 1 days/month and 1. 5 ± 3. 5 days/month, respectively. AFQLQ 1 negatively correlated with the symptomatic AF frequency (Spearman's correlation coefficient: r=− 0. 332, p< 0. 001). AFQLQ 2 and AFQLQ 3 correlated with both the symptomatic AF frequency (r=− 0. 27, p< 0. 001 and r=− 0. 265, p< 0. 001, respectively) and asymptomatic AF frequency (r=− 0. 197, p< 0. 01 and r=− 0. 229, p< 0. 005, respectively). ConclusionThe asymptomatic AF episode frequency correlates with a reduced QoL in patients with paroxysmal AF, suggesting that there would be psychological benefits to its reduction...|$|R
