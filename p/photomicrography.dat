25|$|Description: The goal of {{this study}} was to perform a {{comparative}} study of living and fixed cytoplasm using the eggs at different stages. Strobell and Foot were able to study live eggs of Allolobophora foetida under high magniication using a Bausch and Lomb compressor, a feat that Foot had been attempting since 1894. The purpose of this particular paper was to discuss the <b>photomicrography</b> techniques using a broad overview of their work with the eggs. Three plates at different stages labeled A, B, and C are discussed in detail with 6 accompanying photographs each to show different perspectives.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the bacterial abundance and biomass, samples of 10  ml were preserved with formaldehyde borato-buffered (2 % final concentration) and stored in dark at 4 °C. From each sample, 1  ml were stained in the dark with 4, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI; 1.8  mg l− 1 final concentration) (Porter and Feig [1980]) and filtered on 0.22  mm black polycarbonate filters. The filters that contain the samples were mounted on slides and stored frozen until analysis. The bacterial enumeration was done using the <b>photomicrographies</b> taken under UV excitation in an Olympus BX- 50 epifluorescence microscope (Olympus Corporation, Shinjuku-ku, Japan) and a Lumenera camera (Ottawa, ON, Canada). For each filter, 20 random fields of 250  μm− 2 were analyzed in the Image Pro Plus 7.1. All cells were counted and measured to calculate cell volumes (μm 3) and then were converted to cell carbon (pg C cell− 1) using conversion carbon of 0.35  pg C μm 3 for heterotrophic bacteria (Bjørnsen [1986]). The carbon biomasses were estimated by multiplying the cell carbon by their abundances.|$|R
40|$|Leishmanias can be {{produced}} by inoculation in conditioned McCoy cell culture growth medium (CGM). Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi (100 parasites) grown in NNN medium was inoculated in 2. 5 mL CGM, kept in plates (24 wells) and its multiplication was observed for five days (120 hours). After day 5, the medium was saturated with the flagellate forms of the parasite (promastigotes). The reproduction of the leishmanias was observed every 24 hours {{and the number of}} parasites was calculated by counting the parasites in a drop of 10 µ L and <b>photomicrographied.</b> So the number of Leishmanias was adjusted to 1 mL volume. The advantage of the technique by isolation of Leishmania in CGM demonstrated in this study is its low cost and high efficacy even with a small quantity of parasites (10 ² promastigotes) used as inoculum. Additionally, isolation of the leishmania can be obtained together with an increase in their density (180 times) as observed by growth kinetics, within a shorter time. These results justify the use of this low-cost technique for the isolation and investigation of the behavior and multiplication of Leishmania both in vertebrates and invertebrates, besides offering means of obtaining antigens, whether whole antigens (leishmanias) or the soluble antigens produced by the parasites which may be useful for the production of new diagnostic kits...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} laser etching on dentin are studied by microenergy-dispersive x-ray {{fluorescence}} spectrometry (μ-EDXRF) and {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) to establish the correlation of data obtained. Fifteen human third molars are prepared, baseline μ-EDXRF mappings are performed, and ten specimens are selected. Each specimen received four treatments: acid etching (control-CG) or erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG) laser irradiation (I- 100 mJ, II- 160 mJ, and III- 220 mJ), and maps are done again. The Ca and P content are significantly reduced after acid etching (ρ < 0. 0001) and increased after laser irradiation with 220 mJ (Ca: p < 0. 0153 and P: ρ < 0. 0005). The Ca/P ratio increased and decreased after CG (ρ = 0. 0052) and GI (p = 0. 0003) treatments, respectively. CG treatment resulted in lower inorganic content (GI: ρ < 0. 05, GII: ρ < 0. 01, and GIII: ρ < 0. 01) and higher Ca/P ratios than laser etching (GI: ρ < 0. 001, GII: ρ < 0. 01, and GIII: ρ < 0. 01). The SEM <b>photomicrographies</b> revealed open (CG) and partially open dentin tubules (GI, GII, and GIII). μ-EDXRF mappings illustrated that acid etching created homogeneous distribution of inorganic content over dentin. Er:YAG laser etching (220 mJ) produced irregular elemental distribution and changed the stoichiometric proportions of hydroxyapatite, as showed by an increase of mineral content. Decreases and increases of mineral content in the μ-EDXRF images are correlated to holes and mounds, respectively, as found in SEM images. FAPESP (05 / 50811 - 9) CNPq (302761 / 2009 - 8...|$|R

40|$|Os autores adaptaram ao estudo da citologia do LCR o liqüido diluidor de Anguiano e Ancira, proposto para realização do hemograma em câmara de contagem. O procedimento técnico varia {{conforme}} o aspecto do LCR e de acordo com o número global de células. A morfologia das células à técnica de coloração supravital (TCSV) é descrita pormenorizadamente. Utilizando a técnica de Moraes-Rêgo e Fernandes os autores determinaram os desvios padrões para cada tipo de células e tabularam o percentual de células determinado na lâmina corada em cada caso. Demonstraram que os valores obtidos pela TCSV caíram dentro dos limites de tolerância calculados sendo, portanto, os valores das contagens equivalentes aos encontrados nas contagens feitas em lâminas, tomadas,) estas, como padrão. Com a experiência adquirida durante 5 anos de utilização da TCSV, os autores a recomendam como técnica de eleição para a contagem diferencial da célula do LCR. The authors {{adapted to}} the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) the staining technic developed by Anguiano and Ancira to perform differential leucocyte counts in the counting chamber. The formula they used is the following: methyl alcohol 1 ml, destilled water 2 ml. To this mixture are added: 6 drops of Leishman stain filtered in Whatman paper number 42; toluidine blue 0. 25 % aqueous solution (filtered in the same manner), 1 drop; acetate buffer 0. 1 M, pH 5. 4, 1 drop. The technic varies according to the intensity of pleocytosis. If the CSF is turbid or contains more than 100 cells per c. m. 1 drop is dripped in the botton of a 10 X 75 test tube and then 2 drops of the staining fluid are added; the mixture is then snaked; after one or two minutes 1 drop {{is placed in the}} Fuchs-Rosenthal counting chamber. If the number of total cells is less than 100 per c. m. (Table 1), different CSF volumes are centrifuged at the rate of 2000 r. p. m., during 6 minutes; the supernatant fluid is poured off and the sedimented cells are suspended in 2 drops of the staining fluid. The morphology of the cells as they appear after they are stained by the supravital staining technic (SVST) is described and illustrated in <b>photomicrographies.</b> By using the technic described by Moraes-Rêgo and Fernandes the authors enumerated the first 200 cells encountered in each of 10 smears of the same samples of CSF containing 250 cells per c. m., and calculated the standard desviation (SD) for each (Table 2). In another experiment they counted 200 cells in 10 samples of CSF with different levels of pleocytosis, by both technics. By applying the SD to the cell counts in stained smears they determined the accetable superior and inferior limits for each count (Table 3). There one verifies that the corresponding counting by SVST fell between the maximum and minimum accetable values. With the experience acquired in 5 years of intensive countings by the SVST the authors consider this technic the most adequate for differential counts of leucocytes in the CSF...|$|R
