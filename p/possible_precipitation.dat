50|$|The mineralogic {{composition}} of carbonate platforms may be either calcitic or aragonitic. Seawater is oversaturated in carbonate, so {{under certain conditions}} CaCO3 <b>precipitation</b> is <b>possible.</b> Carbonate <b>precipitation</b> is thermodynamically favoured at high temperature and low pressure. Three types of carbonate precipitation are possible: biotically controlled, biotically induced and abiotic. Carbonate precipitation is biotically controlled when organisms (such as corals) are present that exploit carbonate dissolved in seawater to build their calcitic or aragonitic skeletons. Thus they may develop hard reef structures. Biotically induced precipitation takes place outside the cell of the organism, thus carbonate is not directly produced by organisms, but precipitates because of their metabolism. Abiotic precipitation involves little or no biological influence.|$|R

Alternately, the spectra become more complex, when ZrOCl 2 concentration decreases (compare data for CR- 3 and CR- 6). This is probably caused by H 3 PO 4 capsulation with ZHP nanoparticles. No leaching of acid occurs during washing of the samples with deionized water.

A microwave imager is proposed for scanning ahead of the satellite in order to identify areas of precipitation, and then an on-board antenna controller can reposition the scanning antenna to obtain reflectivities for use in rainfall-reflectivity relationships.

The Ustka is a typical tourist town and Czołpino is located in the Slovinski National Park away from urban or rural areas. The beach sediments in Ustka contain much more organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus compounds as well as calcium carbonate than analogous deposits in Czołpino. The effect of sea water was manifested in the high content of organic matter in places having permanent contact with sea water. The content of the organic matter increased together with with the depth of settlings in these places.

40|$|Radar {{polarization}} {{measurements of}} precipitation at 16. 5 GHz are analyzed {{with reference to}} the ambient temperature profile of the atmosphere.

In this work, the coprecipitation of polyvinylpyrrolidone/nimesulide (PVP/NIM) nanostructured microparticles using Supercritical Antisolvent (SAS) was proposed. The effects of the main process parameters, such as polymer/drug ratio, overall concentration, operating pressure and temperature were investigated to identify successful operating conditions for SAS coprecipitation.

40|$|This {{experimental}} work aims {{to better understand}} the hardening process of limestone tuff after compaction when water content varies. Indeed, the pavements built with wet calcareous crust or tuff are hardened by the effect of compaction followed by water evaporation but this cohesion after compaction disappears completely by total saturation. In order to classify the materials according to geotechnical specifications related to limestone crusts, tuff from Faidh el Botmaarea was studied by following the change of compressive strength measured on specimens prepared at different water contents and stored for several days either under air (for fast drying) or in nonhermetic bags (for slow drying).

40|$|Carbonation of {{industrial}} alkaline residues {{can be used}} as a CO 2 sequestration technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In this study, steel slag samples were carbonated to a varying extent. Leaching experiments and geochemical modeling were used to identify solubility-controlling processes of major and trace elements, both with regard to carbonation mechanisms and the environmental properties of the (carbonated) steel slag. Carbonation was shown to reduce the leaching of alkaline earth metals (except Mg) by conversion of Ca-phases, such as portlandite, ettringite, and Ca-(Fe) -silicates into calcite, possibly containing traces of Ba and Sr. The leaching of vanadium increased substantially upon carbonation, probably due to the dissolution of a Ca-vanadate. The reactive surface area of Al- and Fe-(hydr) oxides increased with the carbonation degree, which tends to reduce the leaching of sorption-controlled trace elements. Sorption on Mn-(hydr) oxides was found to be required to adequately model the leaching of divalent cations, but was not influenced by carbonation. Consideration of these three distinct reactive surfaces and <b>possible</b> (surface) <b>precipitation</b> reactions resulted in adequate modeling predictions of oxyanion and trace metal leaching from (carbonated) steel slag.
