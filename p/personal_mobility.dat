Fins have a large blade area and use the more powerful leg muscles, so are much more efficient for propulsion and manoeuvring thrust than arm and hand movements, but require skill to provide fine control.

The number of railway passengers trebled in just eight years between 1842 and 1850: traffic volumes roughly doubled in the 1850s and then doubled again in the 1860s.|$|E

One can either use public or private transport to meet others and talk face to face, or {{use a variety of}} communication networks, like mobile or fixed telephones or the Internet, to travel virtually. "Personal Mobilities" provides a systematic study of personal movement focusing on the dimensions of space, individuals, societies and technologies. Kellerman examines a variety of <b>personal</b> <b>mobilities,</b> including air transportation, through several perspectives, examining the human need for movement, their anchoring within wider societal trends, commonalities and differences among mobility technologies and international differences. Although spatial mobility seems geographical by its very nature, the topic has been so far treated only partially, and mainly by sociologists. "Personal Mobilities" highlights geographical as well as sociological aspects and is the first book to focus solely on <b>personal</b> <b>mobilities...</b>|$|R

40|$|Social {{activities}} {{are an important}} aspect of health and quality of life of the aging population. They are key elements in the prevention of loneliness. In order to create living environments that stimulate older adults to engage in social activities, more insight is needed in the social activity patterns of the aging population. This study therefore analyzes the heterogeneity in older adults’ preferences for different social activity location types and the relationship between these preferences and <b>personal</b> and <b>mobility</b> characteristics. This is done using a latent class multinomial logit model based on two-day diary data collected in 2014 in Noord-Limburg in the Netherlands among 213 respondents aged 65 or over. The results show that three latent classes can be identified among the respondents who recorded social activities in the diary: a group that mainly socializes at home, a group that mainly socializes at a community center and a group that is more likely to socialize at public ‘third’ places. The respondents who did not record any interactions during the two days, are considered as a separate segment. Relationships between segment membership and <b>personal</b> and <b>mobility</b> characteristics were tested using cross-tabulations with chi-square tests and analyses of variance. The results suggest that both <b>personal</b> and <b>mobility</b> characteristics {{play an important role in}} social activity patterns of older adults...|$|R

40|$|Tourism mobilities {{have long}} been spatialized as {{circular}} structures emanating from a primary home that is opposed to a space of ‘away’. Increasingly complex <b>personal</b> <b>mobilities</b> and experiences with multiple homes, however, challenge the assumptions on which this spatialization of tourism rests. This article utilizes an analysis of travel memoir narratives of return home and second home mobilities to deconstruct the oppositions within traditional spatializations of tourism, revealing in the process {{the way in which}} the everyday and tourism are entangled and interactive. Memoir authors construct complex relationships between spaces and places, wherein second homes can inspire new tourism practices at both unfamiliar locations and primary homes, and returning to previous homes can involve tourism of and at home. A consideration of these relationships reveals the difficulty of labeling mobilities as essentially touristic and suggests possibilities for new spatializations, ontology and methodologies that leave room for many homes for tourism...|$|R
