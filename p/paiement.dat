500|$|Flyers' coach Bob McCammon {{argued that}} McCrimmon had been [...] "intimidated" [...] by playing with fellow 1979 Bruins pick and all-star, Ray Bourque, {{and that he}} could be a better overall defenceman. McCrimmon's offence {{improved}} in his first two seasons in Philadelphia – 25 points in 1982–83 and 24, though without a goal scored, in 1983–84 – but he established himself as a top shutdown defenceman with the Flyers. He recorded 43 points in 1984–85 and posted a plus-minus rating of +52, fifth best in the NHL. McCrimmon was ruled out of the 1985 Stanley Cup Playoffs in the third game of the league semi-final against the Quebec Nordiques when he suffered a third-degree separation of his left shoulder following a hard hit by Wilf <b>Paiement,</b> an injury that required surgery to repair. The Flyers reached the final without McCrimmon, but were defeated by the Edmonton Oilers for the Stanley Cup. McCrimmon returned to start the 1985–86 season, in which he had his best season statistically. [...] He appeared in all 80 games for the Flyers and set career highs of 13 goals, 43 assists, 56 points and his plus-minus rating of +83 was second only to defensive partner Mark Howe.

2500|$|The {{two main}} characters, [...] "Guy et Sylvie", are {{named after the}} actors who play them. Guy likes to tease Sylvie {{on a variety of}} subjects, and hates her mother. His father is {{remarried}} to a young, good-looking stripper, Mélanie, played by Mahée <b>Paiement,</b> and had a child with her. The attention the child receives makes Guy jealous, his father having spent little time with him when he was a child. Unlike Guy, Sylvie dreams of having a baby. She is jealous of Geneviève, Guy's sexy, and promiscuous, office colleague with whom he had a one-time affair years ago. She is also obsessed with cleanliness and resents Guy for being untidy. A curious running gag from the show involves Guy surprising Sylvie by grabbing her breasts from behind while shouting [...] "Road Runner!", followed by the cartoon character's emblematic honking [...] "beeb beeb" [...] sound. While she ostensibly loves it, she pretended the exact opposite when it was obliquely brought up by Guy in front of her mother. This joke was developed on the set by the two actors. The last season saw notable developments: a marriage, and a trip to Vietnam to adopt a little girl.|$|E

In the NHL Expansion Draft, {{most of the}} players available were either aging veterans or career minor-leaguers before expansion occurred. Among the Flyers' 20 selections were Bernie Parent, Doug Favell, Bill Sutherland, Ed Van Impe, Joe Watson, Lou Angotti, Leon Rochefort and Gary Dornhoefer. Having purchased the minor-league Quebec Aces, the team had a distinctly francophone flavor in its early years, with Parent, Rochefort, Andre Lacroix, Serge Bernier, Jean-Guy Gendron, Simon Nolet and Rosaire <b>Paiement</b> among others. Beginning play in 1967–68, the Philadelphia Flyers made their debut on October 11, 1967, losing 5–1 {{on the road to the}} California Seals. They won their first game a week later, defeating the St. Louis Blues on the road, 2–1. The Flyers made their home debut in front of a crowd of 7,812, shutting out their intrastate rivals, the Pittsburgh Penguins, 1–0 on October 19. Lou Angotti was named the first captain in Flyers history, while Rochefort was the Flyers' top goal scorer after netting a total of 21 goals. With all six expansion teams grouped into the same division, the Flyers were able to win the division with a sub-.500 record despite being forced to play their last seven home games on the road due to a storm blowing parts of the Spectrum's roof off. Playoff success, however, did not come so quickly, as the Flyers were upset by St. Louis in a first round, seven-game series.|$|E

40|$|QA, La Questione AgrariaThe aim of {{this paper}} is to reconsider the {{objectives}} of European farm policy taking a long-term view to assessing the instruments currently in place and advancing some suggestions for the design of the future Cap due in 2013. The pro- posed guidelines for reforms include defining targeting instruments on clear objectives, guaranteeing social return for public money and replacing assistance with incentives. Measures are suggested to make EU agriculture more competitive by adapting instruments and regulations to that purpose. It is proposed to amend the current complex payment schemes, which could be simplified with a set of payments based on "contracts for services" only, including potentially three basic levels of services (basic husbandry of the countryside preserving farming landscapes; territorial services; environmentally sensitive measures). Regarding market management, it is proposed to reform but maintain public intervention to guarantee a floor price (or "safety net") restricted to exceptional circumstances. Sharing financial responsibility between the EU and the Member States according to the principle of subsidiarity would imply some co-financing of the first pillar. Les réformes récentes de la Politique Agricole Commune (PAC) ont permis de réduire de nombreux problèmes. La nouvelle PAC reste cependant soumise à plusieurs critiques dont il faut tenir compte dans la définition des futurs instruments. En particulier, les problèmes de capitalisation du soutien dans des actifs, de protection de l'environnement ou de répartition budgétaire imposent des choix tels que les aides directs doivent à l'avenir être davantage orientées vers la fourniture de biens publics.

40|$|URL] EMU or the {{question}} of central banks' independence raise questions centered on the privilege of minting money. In this perspective, it seems important to study Neochartalism, {{in so far as}} it extends the analysis initiated by Knapp, and investigates specifically the links between money and the State. This text is a critical analysis, based on both historical and theoretical arguments. Neochartalism first assumes that there is a link between fiscal policy and the collective acceptability of money. However, as argued by Aglietta and Orlean, focusing exclusively on the power of the State to impose taxes does not seems sufficient to appraise all of this phenomenon's characteristics. When Neochartalists focus on the way money is integrated into the economy, they again establish a link between fiscal policy and monetary emission. Nevertheless, the analysis of our modern systems of payments shows {{that it is difficult to}} consider that the State can initiate the process of money creation. Within our current banking and monetary economies, money seems to be created by the banks rather than by the State. La dollarisation de certaines économies, la création de l'euro ou la question de l'indépendance des banques centrales soulèvent des interrogations centrées sur le privilège de « battre monnaie ». A cet égard, la thèse néo-chartaliste, qui développe l'analyse initiée par Knapp, mérite une attention toute particulière, puisqu'elle aborde spécifiquement les liens entre monnaie et État. Nous en proposons dans ce texte une lecture critique, basée sur des éléments historiques et théoriques. L'approche néo-chartaliste suppose tout d'abord un lien entre fiscalité et acceptabilité collective de la monnaie. Or, en s'appuyant notamment sur les travaux d'Aglietta et Orléan, il apparaît que le seul recours à l'État n'est pas suffisant pour appréhender dans toute sa complexité ce problème. Lorsqu'ils s'intéressent aux phénomènes d'intégration de la monnaie dans l'économie, les néo-chartalistes établissent de nouveau un lien entre fiscalité et émission monétaire. Toutefois, l'analyse du système des <b>paiements</b> actuel montre qu'il est délicat de conférer à l'État un rôle moteur en matière de création monétaire. Au sein de nos économies monétaires et bancaires, la monnaie semble ainsi bien plus une créature des banques que de l'État...|$|R
