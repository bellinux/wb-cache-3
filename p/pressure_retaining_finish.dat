40|$|The <b>pressure</b> <b>retaining</b> door is {{obviously}} a sensible part of an aircraft, and the design criteria is much more critical than for the fuselage, so a problem caused by this critical criteria is the heavy weight of the door structure because it should {{be strong enough to}} withstand loads and stiff enough to meet the sealing requirements. In spite of the <b>pressure</b> <b>retaining</b> door being so important, it is difficult to find design references. So, in this thesis, the <b>pressure</b> <b>retaining</b> door is investigated first, and then a typical structure of a type A door is selected as the study case using both metallic and composite material, in order to generate a standard method for door structure design, and to identify the key factors which can affect the structure weight. The study indicates that the structure weight of a type A door can be kept in a range for different combinations of beams and stringers, and the composite door structure can be 20 % lighter than the metallic door while the stiffness of the two doors remains similar. It is found that the skin contributes much more weight to the door structure than other components and the skin thickness is affected by the short edge of the skin panel divided by beams and stringers. The results also found that it is much more serious when the end stop fails than when the middle stops fail. Therefore, it appears that the composite door is a good material as an alternative to aluminium. Also the method of door structure design is reasonable for the composite door, although {{it would be better to}} consider the stiffness of beams while in the theory design period. Besides IRP, the Group Design Project (GDP) is another important part of the MSc study; it lasts nearly half a year and we complete the Fly-wing concept design. The main contribution of the author to the GDP is the arrangement of doors, and also includes the family issues, cabin layout arrangement and a 3 D model construct, which can be seen in APPENDIX B.

40|$|Pressure {{evolution}} Elastic model a b s t r a c t Quartz inclusion thermobarometry utilizes the pressure- and temperature-sensitive Raman peak {{shifts of}} quartz inclusions in garnet to determine formation pressure and temperature (PT) conditions. The measured Raman shift indicates the <b>pressure</b> currently <b>retained</b> in the inclusions at ambient external conditions, such that entrapment PT conditions (i. e., P and T of garnet growth) {{can be determined}} by elastic modeling. Most generally, trapping P is obtained with this method, based on an independent estimate of T. Here we describe QuIB Calc, a MATLABs program that iteratively solves for garnet growth conditions using the <b>pressure</b> <b>retained</b> in quartz inclusions (as revealed by Raman peak shifts). The program explicitly accounts for the anomalous effects of the quartz lambda transition on the thermal expansivity, and utilizes a mixing subroutine {{to account for the}} physical properties of garnet solid solutions.

50|$|Racing engines {{often fail}} at high {{rotational}} speeds because mechanical springs {{are unable to}} retract the valves quickly enough to provide clearance for the piston. Renault's pneumatic valve technology replaced steel springs with light weight compressed air bellows. These could retract valves more quickly and reduce the possibility of piston-valve interference, as long as pressure could be maintained. Additionally, the amount of seat tension required to keep a coil sprung valve under control results in greater peak lift loading, with added stress to the entire valvetrain as a result. Pneumatic systems, sharing a common reservoir of <b>pressure</b> <b>retain</b> a more static level of force, controlling the valve effectively, without any attendant peak lift load increase.|$|R
