Students (N = 181, 54. 7 % female, 63. 5 % African American) completed test batteries during their fifth-(age = 10. 7 +/- 0. 7 years), sixth-, and seventh-grade years.

Fitness measures included the PWC 170 cycle ergometer test, strength tests, triceps skinfold thickness, and BMI. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for VPA, MVPA, and after-school EE ranged from 0. 63 to 0. 78. ICCs ranged from 0. 49 to 0. 71 for measures of inactivity and from 0. 78 to 0. 82 for the fitness measures.

It tries to catch state of <b>physical</b> activity (<b>inactivity)</b> in representative file of population. The goal of authors was find dependencies between demographic data (age, gender, education, occupation, [...] .) {{and degree of}} physical activity.

Because the whole concept lattice was very large and contained number of concepts not interesting for expert that evaluated data from questionnaire, we used binary relations to constrain it.

25|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>inactivity</b> as a {{child could}} result in <b>physical</b> <b>inactivity</b> as an adult. In a fitness survey of 6,000 adults, {{researchers}} discovered that 25% {{of those who were}} considered active at ages 14 to 19 were also active adults, compared to 2% of those who were inactive at ages 14 to 19, who were now said to be active adults. Staying physically inactive leaves unused energy in the body, most of which is stored as fat. Researchers studied 16 men over a 14-day period and fed them 50% more of their energy required every day through fats and carbohydrates. They discovered that carbohydrate overfeeding produced 75–85% excess energy being stored as body fat and fat overfeeding produced 90–95% storage of excess energy as body fat.|$|E

30|$|A {{review of}} genetic and {{lifestyle}} factors {{of the performance}} of the East Africans distance runners concluded that the findings on candidate genes linked to performance of Caucasian populations were not confirmed in East Africans showing research methods’ limitations and the polygenic nature of performance (Tucker et al. 2013). This was in agreement with another review showing that distance running success of East Africans was not based on a unique genetic profile (Wilber and Pitsiladis 2012). Another parameter that has not been studied previously as much as the abovementioned parameters might be the <b>physical</b> activity and <b>inactivity</b> levels when athletes did not practise their sport. Surprisingly, a study in marathon and half-marathon runners showed that these athletes trained for 6.5  h weekly, but they also spent much more time sitting (Whitfield et al. 2014). The aforementioned study found no relationship between sitting time and performance. However, potential differences in non-sport <b>physical</b> activities and <b>inactivity</b> levels between East Africans and Europeans should be examined in future studies.|$|R

40|$|Background: Participation in {{organised}} {{youth sports}} (OYS) has been recommended {{as an opportunity}} to increase young peoples’ moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) levels. Participants, however, spend a considerable proportion of time during OYS inactive. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to investigate whether coaches who attended coach education sessions (where education on increasing MVPA and decreasing inactivity during training was delivered) can increase players’ MVPA during training sessions over a 5 -day basketball program compared to coaches who did not receive coach education sessions. Methods/design: A convenience sample of 80 female players and 8 coaches were recruited into the UWS School Holiday Basketball Program in Greater Western Sydney, Australia. A two-arm, parallel-group randomised controlled trial was employed to investigate whether coaches who attended 2 coach education sessions (compared with a no-treatment control) can increase their players’ MVPA during training sessions over a 5 -day basketball program. Objectively measured physical activity, directly observed lesson context and leader behaviour, player motivation, players’ perceived autonomy support, and coaching information (regarding training session planning, estimations on player physical activity and lesson context during training, perceived ability to modify training sessions, perceived importance of physical activity during training, intention to increase <b>physical</b> activity/reduce <b>inactivity,</b> and likelihood of increasing <b>physical</b> activity/reducing <b>inactivity)</b> were assessed at baseline (day 1) and at follow-up (day 5). Linear mixed models will be used to analyse between arm differences in changes from baseline to follow-up on all outcomes. Discussion: The current trial protocol describes, to our knowledge, the first trial conducted in an OYS context to investigate the efficacy of an intervention, relative to a control, in increasing MVPA. This study’s findings will provide evidence to inform strategies targeting coaches to increase MVPA in OYS, which could have major public health implications, given the high proportion of children and adolescents who participate in OYS globally...|$|R

Methods: <b>Physical</b> activity and <b>inactivity</b> were evaluated in 723 type 1 diabetic subjects, 240 children aged 6 – 10 yr and 483 adolescents aged 11 – 19 yr, using a questionnaire that can estimate total amount of time spent on inactivity and light, moderate and vigorous activity. Results: Overall, 54 % of the participants do not fulfil the international recommendations of 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous activity per day. Girls are less active than boys in childhood (70 vs. 88 min/d, p = 0. 01) and in adolescence (47 vs. 57 min/d, p = 0. 02). Furthermore, this study shows that those who are more active are also those who seldom skip meals (p < 0. 001).

The increased amount of obesity can be contributed to the nutrition transition that describes how people are now increasingly turning to high-fat, sugar, and salt food sources because of their availability and price. [...] This food transition has fueled the obesity epidemic. This nutrition transition tends to start in cities because of [...] "greater availability, accessibility, and acceptability of bulk purchases, convenience foods, and 'supersized' portions" [...] (Dixon et al., 2007). [...] Physical activity and exercise is strongly determined by the design of cities, including density of homes, heterogeneous land uses, {{the extent to which}} streets and sidewalks connect, the walkability, and the provision of and access to local public accommodations and parks for recreation and play. [...] These factors, along with increasing reliance on cars, results in the shift of the population toward <b>physical</b> <b>inactivity,</b> which damages health (Friel, Chopra & Satcher, 2007).|$|E
