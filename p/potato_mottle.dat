40|$|Interactions of viral {{proteins}} play {{an important}} role in the virus life cycle, especially in capsid assembly. Andean <b>potato</b> <b>mottle</b> comovirus (APMoV) is a plant RNA virus with a virion formed by two coat proteins (CP 42 and CP 22). Both APMoV coat protein open reading frames were cloned into pGBT 9 and pGAD 10, two-hybrid system vectors. HF 7 c yeast cells transformed with the p 9 CP 42 construct grew on yeast dropout selection media lacking tryptophan and histidine. Clones also exhibited ß-galactosidase activity in both qualitative and quantitative assays. These results suggest that CP 42 protein contains an amino acid motif able to activate transcription of His 3 and lacZ reporter genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Several deletions of the CP 42 gene were cloned into the pGBT 9 vector to locate the region involved in this activation. CP 42 constructions lacking 12 residues from the C-terminal region and another one with 267 residues deleted from the N-terminus are still able to activate transcription of reporter genes. However, transcription activation was not observed with construction p 9 CP 42 deltaC 57, which does not contain the last 57 amino acid residues. These results demonstrate that a transcription activation domain is present at the C-terminus of CP 42 between residues 267 and 374...|$|E

40|$|We {{found that}} Sweet <b>potato</b> {{feathery}} <b>mottle</b> virus (SPFMV) P 1, a close homologue of Sweet <b>potato</b> mild <b>mottle</b> virus P 1, {{did not have}} any silencing suppressor activity. Remodeling the Argonaute (AGO) binding domain of SPFMV P 1 by the introduction of two additionalWG/GWmotifs converted it to a silencing suppressor with AGO binding capacity. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of the transformation of a viral protein of unknown function to a functional silencing suppressor. RNA silencing is a sequence-specific cellular process that leadsto RNA degradation, inhibition of translation of mRNAs, or heterochromatin formation (10). RNA silencing has several func-tions; {{one of the most important}} is to counteract viruses and transposons. Viruses evolved silencing suppressors to inhibit RNA silencing (1). Cellular proteins possessing WG/GW domains are known to bind Argonaute (AGO) via their tryptophan (W) resi-dues (3, 4, 6, 13, 15). The P 1 protein of Sweet <b>potato</b> mild <b>mottle</b> virus (SPMMV) is a silencing suppressor that is able to counteract the active RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) by binding AGO (5).

40|$|In sub-Saharan Africa, sweetpotato (Impomoea batatas L.) {{production}} is greatly constrained by sweetpotato virus disease (SPVD) complex. This {{study was conducted}} to assess the incidence of viruses in healthy-looking sweetpotato in Uganda and to optimise modern technologies for virus diagnosis. A collection of healthy-looking sweetpotato vines from central Uganda were serologically assayed for sweetpotato viruses and the positive samples were confirmed by RT-PCR. A multiplex RT-PCR assay was optimised for simultaneous detection of Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV), Sweet <b>potato</b> feathery <b>mottle</b> virus (SPFMV) and Sweet <b>potato</b> mild <b>mottle</b> virus (SPMMV). The use of in vitro thermotherapy was also investigated as a means of eliminating sweetpotato viruses. Four viruses namely SPCSV, SPFMV, SPMMV and SPCFV were detected mostly as single infections in the healthy looking plants. SPCSV (70. 6 %) recorded highest incidence followed by co-infection of SPFMV and SPCSV (8. 3 %). Based on shoot survival and effectiveness of virus elimination, the best results were obtained by exposing plantlets to daily temperature regime of 32 oC for 8 hr of darkness and 36 oC for 16 hr of light for four weeks.

40|$|Sweet <b>potato</b> {{feathery}} <b>mottle</b> virus (SPFMV) shares many {{biological and}} cytopathological characteristics with viruses in the potyvirus group. However, the native virion lengths for strains of SPFMV range from 810 to 865 nm. This {{is similar to}} the length attained by other potyvirus virions after reaction with divalent ca ions. In this paper we show that the SPFMV genome is an infective, polyadenylated, probably single-stranded RNA molecule with a molecular weight of 3. 65 x 106 and that the coat protein has a molecular weight of 3. 8 x 10 ~. These properties also resemble those of potyviruses. Sweet <b>potato</b> feathery <b>mottle</b> virus (SPFMV) has elongated particles (810 to 865 nm) (Cali & Moyer, 1981 : Campbell et al., 1974; Moyer & Kennedy, 1978 : Nome et at., 1974), induces cytoplasmic, pinwheel inclusions (Lawson et al., 1971) and is non-persistently transmitted by aphids (Kennedy & Moyer, 1982; McLean, 1959). These properties have led to the suggestion that SPFMV should be classified as a potyvirus (Hollings & Brunt, 1981). Potyvirus particles are filamentous, 680 to 900 nm long and contain polyadenylated, plus-sense, single-stranded RNA with a molecular weight of 3. 0 × 106 to 3. 5 x 106 and a capsid of...|$|R

In eastern Africa, virus-induced diseases rank second to weevils in causing yield reduction. Symptomatic sweet potato cuttings (327) were collected from Nyanza and Western Provinces in western Kenya in 2009. The samples were tested for Sweet <b>potato</b> feathery <b>mottle</b> virus (SPFMV), Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV), Sweet <b>potato</b> mild <b>mottle</b> virus (SPMMV), Sweet potato chlorotic fleck virus (SPCFV), Sweet potato latent virus (SPLV), Sweet potato caulimo-like virus (SPCa-LV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), C- 6, Sweet potato virus G (SPVG) and Sweet potato mild speckling virus (SPMSV) using nitrocellulose membrane enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (NCM-ELISA).

50|$|Since most plant viruses exhibit mild, {{localized}} {{effects and}} generally go either undetected or untreated, the symptoms involved in co-infections such as SPVD are a unique threat.

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} during 2001 – 2003 of sweet potato grown by small-scale farmers in the seven main sweet potato-producing provinces of South Africa to determine the incidence of viral diseases in the field. Based on symptoms observed, disease incidence was relatively low. The highest levels of infection observed were between 9 – 10 % in the Western Cape and Mpumalanga. Symptoms were less prevalent or absent in the Eastern Cape, Limpopo, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and North West. However, grafting onto Ipomoea setosa and subsequent testing by ELISA indicated that 81 %of the sampleswere infected by viruses. Nine viruseswere dentified. Sweet <b>potato</b> feathery <b>mottle</b> virus (SPFMV) {{was the most common}} and occurred in 73 % of the samples tested. Sweet <b>potato</b> mild <b>mottle</b> ipomovirus (SPMMV) and Sweet potato latent potyvirus (SPLV) were detected in 3 % and 5 % of the samples, respectively.

The effect of viral infection on storage root yield of ten sweet potato varieties was also studied over two seasons. Total yield was on average reduced by between 12 and 22 %, and marketable yield by 21 to 38 %. Reduction in marketable yield was mainly due to increased cracking of the storage roots. The new Agricultural Research Council varieties Monate and Ndou, and the 1994 - 5 - 1 breeding line produced marketable yields of 34 – 48 tonnes ha– 1 even when infected with viruses, whereas the established South African varieties Mafutha and Natal Red yielded only 4 – 16 tonnes ha– 1...|$|R

They were serologically detected and results confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing. Nucleotide (nt) sequences of the 3 ´-proximal genomic part of SPFMV and SPMMV and partial HSP 70 h gene of SPCSV isolates from Tanzania and Uganda were determined. Results revealed limited genetic variability among East African (EA) isolates for SPFMV and SPCSV but high variability for SPMMV. Phylogenetic analysis grouped Tanzanian and Ugandan isolates into an EA strain for SPFMV and SPCSV. Phylogenetically, four strains of SPFMV were detected: EA, RC and O, and strain C which is distantly related to them. SPCSV isolates were grouped into two distantly related strains: EA group with only East African isolates, and a non-East African (NEA) group with isolates from West Africa {{and other parts of}} the world. No distinct strain groups could be inferred among the SPMMV isolates from East Africa In Australia, Sweet potato virus Y (SPVY; synonymous to SPV- 2) (family Potyviridae) was found to co-infect sweetpotatoes with strains RC and/or C of SPFMV. Five SPVY and SPFMV isolates were sequence-characterised for their 3 ’-proximal end of the genome and compared with isolates from Asia, Africa, Europe and North America. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Australian SPVY isolates formed a separate clade closest to the North American isolates.

40|$|Viruses infecting wild flora {{may have}} a {{significant}} negative impact on nearby crops, and vice-versa. Only limited information is available on wild species able to host economically important viruses that infect sweetpotatoes (Ipomoea batatas). In this study, Sweet potato chlorotic fleck virus (SPCFV; Carlavirus, Betaflexiviridae) and Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV; Crinivirus, Closteroviridae) were surveyed in wild plants of family Convolvulaceae (genera Astripomoea, Ipomoea, Hewittia and Lepistemon) in Uganda. Plants belonging to 26 wild species, including annuals, biannuals and perennials from four agro-ecological zones, were observed for virus-like symptoms in 2004 and 2007 and sampled for virus testing. SPCFV was detected in 84 (2. 9 %) of 2864 plants tested from 17 species. SPCSV was detected in 66 (5. 4 %) of the 1224 plants from 12 species sampled in 2007. Some SPCSV-infected plants were also infected with Sweet <b>potato</b> feathery <b>mottle</b> virus (SPFMV; Potyvirus, Potyviridae; 1. 3 %), Sweet <b>potato</b> mild <b>mottle</b> virus (SPMMV; Ipomovirus, Potyviridae; 0. 5 %) or both (0. 4 %), {{but none of these}} three viruses were detected in SPCFV-infected plants. Co-infection of SPFMV with SPMMV was detected in 1. 2 % of plants sampled. Virus-like symptoms were observed in 367 wild plants (12. 8 %), of which 42 plants (11. 4 %) were negative for the viruses tested. Almost all (92. 4 %) the 419 sweetpotato plants sampled from fields close to the tested wild plants displayed virus-like symptoms, and 87. 1 % were infected with {{one or more of the}} four viruses. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses of the 3 '-proximal genomic region of SPCFV, including the silencing suppressor (NaBP) - and coat protein (CP) -coding regions implicated strong purifying selection on the CP and NaBP, and that the SPCFV strains from East Africa are distinguishable from those from other continents.

The Nitrocellulose Membrane Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (NCM-ELISA) was used as the method of detection of the virus present. The sutdy showed that SPFMV, SPCalV and C- 6 were the major virus present. Where SPVD -like symptoms occured, the presence of SPFMV and other viral combination were noted.

50|$|As {{with all}} {{of the members of the}} Potyviridae family, the Cassava brown streak virus has a positive, single strand RNA genome. Structurally, viruses in this family are linear, non-segmented, possess helical symmetry. The CBSV genome was {{measured}} to be between 8,900 and 10,818 nucleotides in length. This is characteristic of the average genome length among potyviridae which can be anywhere from 9.3-10.8 kb. Genetic diversity on the nucleotide level among CBSV virus isolates can be anywhere from 79.3-95.5%, showing that the virus has greater genetic diversity than other similar potyviridae or CBSV strains. The Potyvirus genome is monopartite, meaning the genome is made up of a single molecule of nucleic acid, not broken up into multiple pieces. CBSV is believed to be a non-enveloped virus with a capsid protein coat that is most similar to that of the ipomovirus, SPMMV (Sweet <b>potato</b> mild <b>mottle</b> virus). Similar to SPMMV, CBSV was found to have larger than average coat proteins of approximately 45 kDa in size.|$|R

The virus did not infect cowpea (Vigna unguiculata varieties IT 82 E- 10, IT 84 S- 2114, Ife brown, TVU 76 or TVU 2657), but produced chlorotic spots, vein clearing and mottling on soybean (Glycine max cultivars Malayan and Samsoy- 2). Protein-A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) shows that the virus is serologically closely related to Sweet <b>potato</b> feathery <b>mottle</b> virus (SPFMV) genus Potyvirus, Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) genus Potyvirus and Tobacco etch virus (TEV) genus Potyvirus. Comparison of amino acid sequences of the coat protein of the virus with several potyvirus coat protein sequences, using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) analysis, confirmed the relationships. The antiserum raised against the virus had a titre value greater than 1 : 16, 000, using antigen-coated plate ELISA.

High populations of B. afer sensu lato are seasonally associated with sweetpotato in Peru during times of low B. tabaci incidence. The transmission of SPCSV (in single and double infection with SPFMV) by laboratory-reared B. afer sensu lato and B. tabaci biotype B was investigated. For SPCSV transmission efficiency, individual adult insects were allowed 48 h for acquisition and inoculation access periods at both 20 and 25 °C.

DsRNA fractions were extracted from symptomatic leaves and used as templates in single and multiplex RT-PCR assays using previously described specific primers for each analyzed virus. The amplified reaction products for SPVC, SPV 2 and SPFMV were of expected size, and direct sequencing of PCR products revealed that they correspond to the coat protein gene (CP) and showed 98 %, 99 % and 99 % identity, respectively, to those viruses. Comparison of the CP genomic and amino acid sequences of the Portuguese viral isolates recovered here with those of ten other sequences of isolates obtained in different countries retrieved from the GenBank showed very few differences.

40|$|The studies {{presented}} in this thesis contribute to improved understanding of genetic variability and interactions of the most prevalent sweetpotato infecting viruses in Uganda. Sweet <b>potato</b> feathery <b>mottle</b> virus (SPFMV; genus Potyvirus), Sweet <b>potato</b> mild <b>mottle</b> virus (SPMMV; genus Ipomovirus), Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV; genus Crinivirus) and Sweet potato chlorotic fleck virus (SPCFV; genus Carlavirus) were serologically detected, and the positive results were confirmed by RT-PCR and sequence analysis. Molecular phylogenetic studies revealed high genetic variability in SPMMV and SPFMV whereas SPCSV isolates from East Africa seem less variable. At a molecular level, strains are now more recognised in SPFMV and SPMMV. Co-infections of SPCSV with SPFMV and/or SPMMV were associated with persistent and more severe symptoms than infections {{with each of the}} viruses alone, and were responsible for over 90 % of the field diseased plants. Novel and severe symptoms including chlorosis, rugosity, leaf strapping and dark green islands caused by the dual infection of SPMMV and SPCSV were observed. These symptoms could be differentiated from those caused by dual infection of SPFMV and SPCSV that is associated specifically with the sweetpotato virus disease (SPVD), characterised by often severe stunting of the plant, distortion and either chlorotic mottle or vein clearing of the leaves. These observations show SPCSV, SPFMV and SPMMV {{to be the most important}} viruses of sweetpotato in Uganda. The name “sweetpotato severe mosaic disease” (SPSMD) is proposed to describe the disease caused by the dual infection of SPMMV and SPCSV. A comparative analysis of the interaction between the phloem-limited SPCSV and either SPFMV or SPMMV indicated more severe disease symptoms and much higher tuber yield reduction as compared to singly infected plants. Immunohistochemical localisation of SPMMV in sweetpotato plants suggest that it could be exploiting niches (mesophyll, companion and epidermal cells) similar to those of SPFMV. SPMMV and SPFMV RNA accumulation greatly increased by over 32 and 64 fold, respectively, in mixed infection with SPCSV. However, accumulation of SPCSV in mixed infection with SPMMV or SPFMV was reduced by 2 - 4 fold, indicating an antagonistic interaction. Neutral (non-detectable) interactions were observed between SPFMV and SPMMV. The synergistic, antagonistic and neutral interactions were observed in plants of the three sweetpotato cultivars, suggesting that they may represent typical interactions of three viruses. These findings further show the importance of SPCSV in elevating virulence of SPFMV and SPMMV, by suppressing the otherwise high levels of host resistance to single infections in East African sweetpotato cultivars. Efforts to particularly control SPCSV (e. g. through RNA-mediated resistance, use of clean planting materials) and improved knowledge on various aspects of the ecology of sweetpotato viruses in Uganda seem to be the next necessary steps towards better management strategies for sweetpotato viral diseases...|$|R
40|$|Background: The bipartite {{single-stranded}} RNA genome of Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV, genus Crinivirus; Closteroviridae) encodes a Class 1 RNase III (RNase 3), a putative hydrophobic protein (p 7) and a 22 -kDa protein (p 22) from genes {{located in}} RNA 1. RNase 3 and p 22 suppress RNA silencing, the basal antiviral defence mechanism in plants. RNase 3 {{is sufficient to}} render sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas) virus-susceptible and predisposes it to development of severe diseases following infection with unrelated virus. The incidence, strains and gene content of SPCSV infecting wild plant species have not been studied. Methodology/Principal Findings: Thirty SPCSV isolates were characterized from 10 wild Ipomoea species, Hewittia sublobata or Lepistemon owariensis (family Convolvulaceae) in Uganda and compared with 34 local SPCSV isolates infecting sweetpotatoes. All isolates belonged to the East African (EA) strain of SPCSV and contained RNase 3 and p 7, but p 22 was not detected in six isolates. The three genes showed only limited genetic variability and the proteins were under purifying selection. SPCSV isolates lacking p 22 synergized with Sweet <b>potato</b> feathery <b>mottle</b> virus (SPFMV, genus potyvirus; Potyviridae) and caused severe symptoms in co-infected sweetpotato plants. One SPCSV isolate enhanced accumulation of SPFMV, but no severe symptoms developed. A new whitefly-transmitted virus (KML 33 b) encoding an RNase 3 homolog (< 56 % identity to SPCSV RNase 3) able to suppresse...|$|R
40|$|Sweet <b>potato</b> {{feathery}} <b>mottle</b> virus (SPFMV, genus Potyvirus) infects {{sweet potato}} {{wherever it is}} cultivated. In single infections, SPFMV often causes only mild symptoms a situation that changes dramatically when it co-infects the plants with Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV, genus Crinivirus). Co-infection generates the sweet potato virus disease (SPVD), the most devastating viral disease of sweet potato that can cause total loss of yield. Previous studies have described RNase 3 as the SPCSV protein responsible for the occurrence of SPVD. However, attempts to find resistance to SPVD based on this knowledge have failed, suggesting possible SPFMV determinants involved {{in the development of}} SPVD. This study aimed to contribute to the molecular understanding of SPFMV, in particular regarding its phylogenetic relationships, genomic structure, and ability to suppress RNA interference (RNAi). Deployment of adequate control measures requires proper characterization of the pathogen. Phylogenetic relationship of SPFMV isolates and closely related potyviruses was ambiguous due to misidentification of viruses often found in mixed infections, and lack of specific methods of detection. In this study, we sequenced the complete genome of SPFMV strain C and found phylogenetic evidence to support its reclassification as a different species, Sweet potato virus C (SPVC). Furthermore, we demonstrated that Sweet <b>potato</b> feathery <b>mottle</b> virus and Sweet potato virus C together with Sweet potato virus G (SPVG) and Sweet potato virus 2 (SPV 2) were found to cluster into one unique monophyletic subgroup among the potyviruses, the so-called SPFMV-group. Members of the SPFMV-group contain some unique genomic features. Based on pairwise comparisons of partial and complete genome sequences we found recombinant isolates in SPFMV and SPVC. We also identified, novel viral determinants characteristic for the SPFMV-group of potyviruses, mainly in the P 1 cistron, a region known for its high variability among potyviruses. An additional domain at the N terminus of P 1 (P 1 -N) which is not found in other potyvirus, but is found in sweet <b>potato</b> mild <b>mottle</b> virus (genus Ipomovirus) is invariably found in members of the SPFMV-group. The P 1 -N domain is followed by a hypervariable region which contains specific hallmarks for each member of the SPFMV-group, and is becoming a promising region for their rapid detection and characterization. However, perhaps the most remarkable finding was the identification of an extra open reading frame (ORF) overlapping the C-terminal part of P 1, and which was designated as pispo (Pretty Interesting Sweet potato Potyvirus ORF). pispo is translated {{as a result of a}} transcriptional slippage mechanism occurring in the members of the SPFMV-group of potyviruses and results in a novel protein P 1 N-PISPO. Plants rely on RNAi, an antiviral defense machinery, to destroy viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules recognized inside cells, and spread the alert signal to neighboring cells. To evade RNAi, viruses encode proteins termed suppressors. Our analyses revealed that both P 1 and P 1 N-PISPO contain RNAi suppressor (RSS) activity. Hence, SPFMV utilizes novel suppressors expressed from the same P 1 region in different reading frames. The protein P 1 N-PISPO suppresses cell-to-cell movement of silencing, probably by blocking the spread of signaling to neighboring cells. In contrast, P 1 protein suppresses silencing only locally. In both cases, a conserved Glycine/Tryptophan (GW) motif located in the P 1 N part of P 1 plays a crucial role in the RSS activity. On the other hand, HC-Pro, a widely known RSS protein of potyviruses was not able to suppress silencing in SPFMV. This particular arrangement, where the RSS activity resides on P 1 region and not in HC-Pro, is not reported in potyviruses, but is known, e. g., in the members of the genus Ipomovirus of the Potyviridae family. Taxonomic, structural and functional findings of this study will contribute greatly to the understanding of the evolution of SPFMV, and characterization of diseases it causes. Bataatin höyhenlaikkavirus (SPFMV, suku Potyvirus) tartuttaa bataattia kaikkialla, missä bataattia viljellään. Yksinään SPFMV aiheuttaa useimmiten vain lieviä oireita, mutta jos kasveilla on samanaikaisesti bataatin kitukasvuvirus (SPCSV, suku Crinivirus) tartunta, tilanne muuttaa dramaattisesti. Kahden viruksen yhteistartunta johtaa ns. bataatin virustautiin (SPVD-tauti), joka on bataatin pahin virustauti, ja se voi johtaa jopa täydelliseen sadonmenetykseen. Aikaisemmat tutkimukset ovat osoittaneet, että SPCSV:n RNase 3 -proteiini yhdessä SPFMV:n kanssa on riittävä aiheuttumaan SPVD-taudin. Yritykset kehittää kestävyyttä bataatin SPVD-tautia vastaan tämän tiedon perusteella ovat kuitenkin epäonnistuneet, mikä voi johtua siitä, että myös SPFMV tarvitaan SPVD-taudin kehittymiseen. Tämän tutkimuksen tarkoituksena oli lisätä molekyylitason ymmärrystä SPFMV:sta ja erityisesti sen fylogeneettisistä sukulaissuhteista, genomirakenteesta ja kyvystä estää RNA-hiljennystä...|$|R
40|$|A {{subgroup}} 2 rhabdovirus {{was isolated}} in south-east Queensland from black-eyed Susan (Thunbergia alata) with symptoms of vein yellowing, vein clearing and leaf distortion. Bacilliform particles accumulated in the perinuclear space of infected plants and measured 69 +/- 7 x 161 +/- 8 nm in unfixed preparations. The virus was not transmitted mechanically. Purified preparations of the Thunbergia alata rhabdovirus (TaRV) contained four major proteins with molecular weights of 80 kD, 48 kD, 40 kD and 35 kD, {{similar to those}} of datura yellow vein virus (DYVV), a newly described rhabdovirus from Australia. The 80 kD protein was identified as the viral glycoprotein. In immunoblots, the two largest proteins of TaRV reacted strongly with antiserum to DYVV, but were serologically distinct from sonchus yellow net, cereal chlorotic <b>mottle,</b> <b>potato</b> yellow dwarf and lettuce necrotic yellows viruses.

40|$|AbstractWhen infecting alone, Sweet <b>potato</b> {{feathery}} <b>mottle</b> virus (SPFMV, genus Potyvirus) and Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV, genus Crinivirus) cause no or only mild symptoms (slight stunting and purpling), respectively, in {{the sweet}} potato (Ipomoea batatas L.). In the SPFMV-resistant cv. Tanzania, SPFMV is also present at extremely low titers, though plants are systemically infected. However, infection with both viruses results {{in the development of}} sweet potato virus disease (SPVD) characterized by severe symptoms in leaves and stunting of the plants. Data from this study showed that SPCSV remains confined to phloem and at a similar or slightly lower titer in the SPVD-affected plants, whereas the amounts of SPFMV RNA and CP antigen increase 600 -fold. SPFMV was not confined to phloem, and the movement from the inoculated leaf to the upper leaves occurred at a similar rate, {{regardless of whether or not}} the plants were infected with SPCSV. Hence, resistance to SPFMV in cv. Tanzania was not based on restricted virus movement, neither did SPCSV significantly enhance the phloem loading or unloading of SPFMV. It is also noteworthy that SPVD is an unusual synergistic interaction in that the potyvirus component is not the cause of synergism but is the beneficiary. It is hypothesized that SPCSV is able to enhance the multiplication of SPFMV in tissues other than where it occurs itself, perhaps by interfering with systemic phloem-dependent signaling required in a resistance mechanism directed against SPFMV...|$|R
40|$|Among {{diseases}} reported worldwidely for {{sweet potato}} (Ipomoea batatas (L) Lam) crop, {{one of the}} most frequent is the Sweet potato virus disease (SPVD), caused by sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV) and sweet <b>potato</b> feathery <b>mottle</b> virus (SPFMV) co-infection. In Argentina, there exists the sweet potato chlorotic dwarf (SPCD), a sweet potato disease caused by triple co-infection with SPCSV, SPFMV and sweet potato mild speckling virus (SPMSV). Both diseases cause a synergism between the potyviruses (SPFMV and SPMSV) and the crinivirus (SPCSV). Up to date, studies carried out on the interaction among these three viruses have not described their localization in the infected tissues. In single infections, virions of the crinivirus genus are limited to the phloem while potyviral virions are found in most tissues of the infected plant. The purpose of this work was to localize the heat shock protein 70 homolog (HSP 70 h), a movement protein for genus crinivirus, of an Argentinean SPCSV isolate in its single infection and in its double and triple co-infection with SPFMV and SPMSV. The localization was made by in situ hybridization (ISH) for electron microscopy (EM) on ultrathin sections of sweet potato cv. Morada INTA infected tissues. The results demonstrated that viral RNA coding HSP 70 h is restricted to phloem cells during crinivirus single infection, while it was detected outside the phloem in infections combined with the potyviruses involved in chlorotic dwarf disease...|$|R
40|$|Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas) is an {{important}} root crop in Uganda, where yield potential and quality attributes have not been fully exploited due to limited breeding efforts and poor knowledge on the inheritance {{of some of its}} agronomic traits. A study was carried out at Makerere University to phenotypically characterise selected sweetpotato cultivars with special reference to sweet potato virus disease (SPVD) resistance, growth habit, flowering and seed set ability, tuber yield and shape, tuber skin and flesh colour, dry matter, starch, sugar and β-carotene content. Twenty cultivars were selected for use in the assessment of their breeding potential and for improvement of yield and quality attributes. Cultivar Munyeera displayed the highest level of SPVD resistance followed by New Kawogo and Polyster as exhibited by relative area under disease progress curves following natural field infection and graft inoculation with SPVD causing viruses, Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus and Sweet <b>potato</b> feathery <b>mottle</b> virus. Flowering ability was low in some cultivars and a few did not flower at all. Some cultivars e. g. Munyeera, New Kawogo, Silk and Sowola which showed high flowering ability failed to fertilise and set seed when crossed to specific cultivars. Preliminary genetic analysis for yield and quality following crossing elite 7 female and 6 male cultivars in a North Carolina 2 mating design showed wide genetic variability in the F 1 s for the important traits, and heterosis was observed for some traits such as tuber size an...|$|R
40|$|Sweet potato {{chlorotic}} stunt virus (genus Crinivirus) {{belongs to}} the family Closteroviridae, members of which have a conserved overall genomic organization but are variable in gene content. In the bipartite criniviruses, heterogeneity is pronounced in the 3 '-proximal region of RNA 1, which in sweet potato chlorotic stuat virus (SPCSV) encodes two novel proteins, RNase 3 (RNase III endonuclease) and p 22 (RNA silencing suppressor). This study showed that two ugandan SPCSV isolates contained the p 22 gene, in contrast to three isolates of the east african strain from Tanzania and Peru and an isolate of the west african strain from Israel, which were missing a 767 nt fragment of RNA 1 that included the p 22 gene. Regardless {{of the presence of}} p 22, all tested SPCSV isolates acted synergistically with potyvirus sweet <b>potato</b> feathery <b>mottle</b> virus (SPFMV; genus Potyvirus, family Potyviridae) in co-infected sweetpotato plants (Ipomoea batatas), which greatly enhanced SPFMV titres and caused severe sweetpotato virus disease (SPVD). Therefore, the results indicate that any efforts to engineer pathogen-derived RNA silencing-based resistance to SPCSV and SPVD in sweetpotato should not rely on p 22 as the transgene. The data from this study demonstrate that isolates of this virus species can vary in the genes encoding RNA silencing suppressor proteins. This study also provides the first example of intraspecific variability in gene content of the family Closteroviridae and may be a new example of the recombination-mediated gene gain that is characteristic of virus evolution in this virus family.

40|$|Sweet {{potatoes}} (Ipomea batatas L.) {{are grown}} extensively, in tropical and temperate regions, and are important food crops worldwide. In Korea, potyviruses, including Sweet <b>potato</b> feathery <b>mottle</b> virus (SPFMV), Sweet potato virus C (SPVC), Sweet potato virus G (SPVG), Sweet potato virus 2 (SPV 2), and Sweet potato latent virus (SPLV), {{have been detected}} in sweet potato fields at a high (~ 95 %) incidence. In the present work, complete genome sequences of 18 isolates, representing the five potyviruses mentioned above, were compared with previously reported genome sequences. The complete genomes consisted of 10, 081 to 10, 830 nucleotides, excluding the poly-A tails. Their genomic organizations were typical of the Potyvirus genus, including one target open reading frame coding for a putative polyprotein. Based on phylogenetic analyses and sequence comparisons, the Korean SPFMV isolates belonged to the strains RC and O with > 98 % nucleotide sequence identity. Korean SPVC isolates had 99 % identity to the Japanese isolate SPVC-Bungo and 70 % identity to the SPFMV isolates. The Korean SPVG isolates showed 99 % identity to the three previously reported SPVG isolates. Korean SPV 2 isolates had 97 % identity to the SPV 2 GWB- 2 isolate from the USA. Korean SPLV isolates had a relatively low (88 %) nucleotide sequence identity with the Taiwanese SPLV-TW isolates, and they were phylogenetically distantly related to SPFMV isolates. Recombination analysis revealed that possible recombination events occurred in the P 1, HC-Pro and NIa-NIb regions of SPFMV and SPLV isolates and these regions were identified as hotspots for recombination in the sweet potato potyviruses...|$|R
