40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} research on several different projects. The first project is a via-less CPW RF <b>probe</b> <b>pad</b> to microstrip transition; The second, the third, and the fourth one are reconfigurable microwave circuits using RF MEMS switches: an X-band reconfigurable bandstop filter for wireless RF frontends, an X-band reconfigurable impedance tuner for a class-E high efficiency power amplifier using RF MEMS switches, and a reconfigurable self-similar antenna using RF MEMS switches. The first project was developed {{in order to facilitate}} the on-wafer measurement for the second and the third project, since both of them are microstrip transmission line based microwave circuits. A thorough study of the via-less CPW RF <b>probe</b> <b>pad</b> to microstrip transition on silicon substrates was performed and general design rules are derived to provide design guidelines. This research work is then expanded to W-band via-less transition up to 110 GHz. The second project is to develop a low power reconfigurable monolithic bandstop filter operating at 8, 10, 13, and 15 GHz with cantilever beam capacitive MEMS switches. The filter contains microstrip lines and radial stubs that provide different reactances at different frequencies. By electrically actuating different MEMS switches, the different reactances from different radial stubs connecting to these switches will be selected, thus, the filter will resonate at different frequencies. The third project is to develop a monolithic reconfigurable impedance tuner at 10 GHz with the cantilever DC contact MEMS switch. The impedance tuner is a two port network based on a 3 bit- 3 bit digital design, and uses 6 radial shunt stubs that can be selected via integrated DC contact MEMS switches. By selecting different states of the switches, there will be a total of 2 ^ 6 = 64 states, which means 64 different impedances will be generated at the output port of the tuner. This will provide a sufficient tuning range for the output port of the power amplifier to maximize the power efficiency. The last project is to integrate the DC contact RF MEMS switches with self-similar planar antennas, to provide a reconfigurable antenna system that radiates with similar patterns over a wide range of frequencies.

An LC-VCO operating at 180 GHz is connected to a nonlinear buffer, {{which is designed to}} generate the wanted third harmonic at 540 GHz. The third harmonic is coupled via a transformer to the output.

By changing value of the parasitic I-MOS varactors of the LC-VCO (“parasitic tuning”), the output frequency can be tuned from 561. 5 to 539. 6 GHz, resulting in a 21. 9 GHz tuning range, which is the highest reported so far for CMOS THz oscillators. The 3 -dB output bandwidth is 5. 5 GHz.

The models {{are required for}} active devices, like transistors or diodes and passive components, like inductors or capacitors. The device models are obtained by characterization of devices on a wafer; such models are hard to obtain in technologies like CMOS due to high substrate losses and low interconnect conductance. In this thesis, a novel de-embedding approach is proposed to characterize the devices in CMOS technology. The proposed de-embedding procedure is based on (1) using a shield based on-wafer test-fixture, (2) estimation of <b>probing</b> <b>pad</b> parasitics using in-fixture standard measurements and (3) modeling of remaining parasitics using the transmission line models. The method can even be extended to de-embed the parasitics of other similar test-fixtures which hold arbitrarily sized devices. The entire de-embedding method makes use of just one in-fixture standard that has physically to be built on a wafer. Several on-wafer test fixtures and the de-embedding standards are built and measured.

This mass production method allows comparison of results, as well as greater options in device analysis. To analyze SBHs at carbon nanotube - metal contacts, field effect transistor (FET) devices were examined using AFM, low temperature measurements in closed - cycle refrigerator (CCR), and electrical characterization. SBH is measured on carbon nanotubes with multiple metal contacts for comparison purposes, with barriers extracted via low temperature activation energy measurements and nonlinear curve fitting using the program Origin.

40|$|End-to-end network {{measurement}} is used {{to improve}} the precision, efficiency, and fairness {{for a variety of}} Internet protocols and applications. Measurement is typically performed in one of three ways: (1) actively, by injecting specially crafted probe packets into the network, (2) passively, by observing existing data traffic, and (3) customized, where applications use their own traffic to perform customized measurements. All current approaches suffer from drawbacks. Passive techniques are efficient but are constrained by the shape of the existing traffic. Active techniques are faster, more accurate and more flexible but impose a significantly higher overhead. And finally, custom techniques combine flexibility with efficiency, but are so tightly coupled with each application that they are not reusable. To address these shortcomings, we present the Measurement Manager, a practical, modular, and efficient service for performing end-to-end network measurements between hosts. Our architecture introduces a new hybrid approach to network measurement, where applications can pool together their data packets to be reused as <b>padding</b> inside network <b>probes</b> in a transparent and systematic way. We achieve this through the Measurement Manager Protocol (MGRP), a new transport protocol for sending probes that combines data packets and probes on the fly. In MGRP, active measurement algorithms specify the probes they wish to send using a Probe API and applications allow MGRP to use data from their own packets to fill the otherwise wasted <b>probe</b> <b>padding.</b> We have implemented the Measurement Manager inside the Linux kernel and have adapted existing applications and active measurement tools to use our system. Through experimentation we provide detailed empirical evidence that piggybacking data packets on measurement probes is not only feasible but improves source and cross traffic as well as the performance of measurement algorithms while not affecting their accuracy. We show that the Measurement Manager is an architecture with broad applications {{that can be used to}} build a generic measurement overlay network as well as expanding the solution space for estimation algorithms, since every application packet can now act as a potential probe...|$|R
