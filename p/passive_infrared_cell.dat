50|$|Occupancy {{sensors to}} allow {{operation}} for whenever someone {{is within the}} area being scanned can control lighting. When motion {{can no longer be}} detected, the lights shut off. <b>Passive</b> <b>infrared</b> sensors react to changes in heat, such as the pattern created by a moving person. The control must have an unobstructed view of the building area being scanned. Doors, partitions, stairways, etc. will block motion detection and reduce its effectiveness. The best applications for <b>passive</b> <b>infrared</b> occupancy sensors are open spaces with {{a clear view of the}} area being scanned. Ultrasonic sensors transmit sound above the range of human hearing and monitor the time it takes for the sound waves to return. A break in the pattern caused by any motion in the area triggers the control. Ultrasonic sensors can see around obstructions and are best for areas with cabinets and shelving, restrooms, and open areas requiring 360-degree coverage. Some occupancy sensors utilize both <b>passive</b> <b>infrared</b> and ultrasonic technology, but are usually more expensive. They can be used to control one lamp, one fixture or many fixtures.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Unattended ground sensors (UGS) {{are widely}} used to monitor human activities, such as {{pedestrian}} motion and detection of intruders in a secure region. Efficacy of UGS systems is often limited by high false alarm rates, possibly due to inadequacies of the underlying algorithms and limitations of onboard computation. In this regard, this paper presents a wavelet-based method for target detection and classification. The proposed method has been validated on data sets of seismic and <b>passive</b> <b>infrared</b> sensors for target detection and classification, {{as well as for}} payload and movement type identification of the targets. The proposed method has the advantages of fast execution time and low memory requirements and is potentially well-suited for real-time implementation with onboard UGS systems.

40|$|Bicycling {{and walking}} have gained {{increased}} attention recently; however, systematic bicycle and pedestrian counts are still scarce. At intersections, transportation agencies are interested in counting bicycles and pedestrians and leveraging for counting purposes, if possible, existing signal detection equipment. This study evaluated four counting technologies: inductive loops and a thermal camera to count bicycles and <b>passive</b> <b>infrared</b> counters and pedestrian signal actuation data to count pedestrians. The four technologies were tested {{in a parking lot}} (controlled environment) and in an intersection (real-world environment). The findings revealed that while the inductive loops and thermal camera counted bicycles accurately in a controlled environment, the loops and cameras failed to do so at an intersection. <b>Passive</b> <b>infrared</b> counters were found to count pedestrians accurately at the intersection sidewalk, and pedestrian signal actuation data could be a cost-effective surrogate for pedestrian demand at signalized intersections...|$|R
