5|$|The {{success of}} Moo, You Bloody Choir saw Richards {{expected}} by record label Sony BMG {{to produce a}} quality follow-up. He denied being under significant pressure, though {{the persistence of the}} label—"Richo, have you got a single? Do you have singles? <b>Please,</b> <b>do</b> you have singles?"—was noted. Much of the writing for Augie March's fourth album took place while touring the United States, which Richards argued minimised the band's opportunities to be creative. In 2008, Augie March began recording Watch Me Disappear at Neil Finn's Auckland studios; they also recorded in Melbourne, Sydney, and Los Angeles. The band worked primarily in New Zealand {{to get away from the}} distraction of Melbourne, their hometown, thus allowing them to focus solely on recording.|$|E

Kling, an alias he adopted because he knew an Army soldier named Kling with whom he shared physical characteristics, and because {{it reminded him of}} the Klingon warriors of Star Trek. On April16, 1995, he drove to Oklahoma City with fellow conspirator Terry Nichols where he parked a getaway car several blocks away from the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The nearby Regency Towers Apartments' lobby security camera recorded images of Nichols' blue 1984 GMC pickup truck on April 16. After removing the license plate from the car, he left a note covering the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) plate that read, [...] "Not abandoned. <b>Please</b> <b>do</b> not tow. Will move by April 23. (Needs battery & cable)." [...] Both men then returned to Kansas.|$|E
500|$|A cover {{version was}} {{released}} by the cast of season two of the television series Glee. The cast performed it on the show as well.

Series co-creator Ryan Murphy explained to The Hollywood Reporter the use of the viral hit as a tribute to popular culture. He said: [...] "There’s a rule for it that's explained in the show. The Glee Club is hired to perform songs for the prom and they were told by the principal to <b>please</b> <b>do</b> popular songs that the kids know." [...] Murphy noted that Glees [...] "Friday" [...] cover offers a different take since it's sung by males for other 17-year-olds. The show pays tribute to pop culture and, love it or hate it, that song is pop culture." ...|$|E

500|$|From {{the start}} of the {{invasion}} onward, TNI forces engaged in the wholesale massacre of Timorese civilians. At {{the start of}} the occupation, Fretilin radio sent the following broadcast: [...] "The Indonesian forces are killing indiscriminately. Women and children are being shot in the streets. We are all going to be killed.... This is an appeal for international help. <b>Please</b> <b>do</b> something to stop this invasion." [...] One Timorese refugee told later of [...] "rape [...] cold-blooded assassinations of women and children and Chinese shop owners". Dili's bishop at the time, Martinho da Costa Lopes, said later: [...] "The soldiers who landed started killing everyone they could find. There were many dead bodies in the streets – all we could see were the soldiers killing, killing, killing." [...] In one incident, a group of fifty men, women, and children – including Australian freelance reporter Roger East – were lined up on a cliff outside of Dili and shot, their bodies falling into the sea. Many such s took place in Dili, where onlookers were ordered to observe and count aloud as each person was executed. It is estimated that at least 2,000 Timorese were massacred in the first two days of the invasion in Dili alone. In addition to Fretilin supporters, Chinese migrants were also singled out for execution; five hundred were killed in the first day alone.|$|E
500|$|Koussevitzky {{then decided}} to perform all of Sibelius's symphonies in the Boston Symphony's 1932–33 season, with {{the world premiere of}} the Eighth as the culmination. In June 1932 Sibelius wrote to Koussevitzky {{suggesting}} that the Eighth be scheduled for the end of October. A week later he retracted: [...] "I am very disturbed about it. <b>Please</b> <b>do</b> not announce the performance." [...] Further promises, for December 1932 and January 1933, brought forth no scores. Koussevitzky was by now losing hope, yet he inquired once more, in the summer of 1933. Sibelius was evasive; he made no promise of delivery but would [...] "return to the matter at a later date". So far as Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony were concerned, the matter ended there. Sibelius had made agreements with other conductors; he had promised the European premiere to Basil Cameron and the Royal Philharmonic Society, and the first Finnish performance to Georg Schnéevoigt, who had recently taken over direction of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra. These arrangements were, however, subject to the illusory Boston premiere, and thus were stillborn. Later in the decade, Eugene Ormandy, a fervent admirer of Sibelius who directed the Philadelphia Orchestra from 1936, is thought to have lobbied strongly for the right to perform the premiere, should the symphony in due course emerge.|$|E
500|$|I am very {{grateful}} that my show was so well received {{all over the}} world. But {{there seems to be}} many misinterpretations about my appearance on the cross and I wanted to explain it myself once and for all. There is a segment in my show where three of my dancers 'confess' or share harrowing experiences from their childhood that they ultimately overcame. My 'confession' follows and takes place on a Crucifix that I ultimately come down from. This is not a mocking of the church. It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or 'Taking Up the Cross' as it says in the Bible. My performance is neither anti-Christian, sacrilegious or blasphemous. Rather, it is my plea to the audience to encourage mankind to help one another and to see the world as a unified whole. I believe in my heart that if Jesus were alive today he would be doing the same thing. My specific intent is to bring attention to the millions of children in Africa who are dying every day, and are living without care, without medicine and without hope. I am asking people to open their hearts and minds to get involved in whatever way they can. The song ends with a quote from the Bible's Book of Matthew: 'For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was naked and you gave me clothing. I was sick and you took care of me and God replied, [...] "Whatever you did for the least of my brothers... you did it to me.' <b>Please</b> <b>do</b> not pass judgement without seeing my show.|$|E
