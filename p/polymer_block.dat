40|$|Most of {{the roads}} are paved with {{impermeable}} materials such as asphalt concrete and cement concrete, and {{in the event of}} heavy rainfall, rainwater directly flows into river through a drainage hole on the pavement surface. This large quantity of rainwater directly spilled into the river frequently leads to the flooding of urban streams, damaging lowlands and the lower reaches of a river. In recent years there has {{been a great deal of}} ongoing research concerning water permeability and drainage in pavements. Accordingly, in this research, a porous polymer concrete was developed for permeable pavement by using unsaturated polyester resin as a binder, recycled aggregate as coarse aggregate, fly ash and blast furnace slag as filler, and its physical and mechanical properties were investigated.

Although the experimental results were in qualitative agreement with the theory, there was significant quantitative variation. This was attributed {{to the presence of}} solvent in the films prior to and during annealing, a hypothesis supported by new preliminary calculations reported here.

40|$|The {{structures}} of polymer brushes under confinement were measured {{using a combination}} of neutron reflectivity and a surface force type apparatus. The samples were either poly(ethylene oxide), PEO, used to investigate the effect of the grafting density or poly(acrylic acid), PAA, used to determine the effect of charge on the structure of a polymer brushes under confinement. Without confinement both PEO and PAA brushes are found to be highly swollen with water, > 50 % v/v, with the expected parabolic brush structure. Compression of the PEO brushes with as little as 0. 5 bar of confinement is found experimentally to reduce the brush to a <b>polymer</b> <b>block</b> of uniform density that is significantly dehydrated, < 12 % v/v. Further subsequent increases in the confinement pressure only marginally decrease the hydration and thickness of the <b>polymer</b> <b>block.</b> The grafting density of the brush does not significantly influence this behavior. PAA polymer brushes with little (pH 3) or an intermediate level of charging (pH 5. 5) are also found to be compressed into a single uniform density <b>polymer</b> <b>block</b> with a confinement of 5 bar. However, {{with a high level of}} charge (pH 9) the brush structure is believed to be partially retained due to the repulsion between the internal charges. These experimental results are compared against a theoretical model based on numerical self-consistent field (nSCF) theory as well as to osmotic, SFA, and AFM data. While the nSCF model correctly predicts the observed transition from a brush to a block profile, experimentally it occurs at a pressure 2 orders of magnitude lower than the simulations would suggest. The results acquired through simulation are consistent with available osmotic pressure data; however, SFA and AFM measurements are consistent with the neutron reflection experimental data presented here. This significant disagreement between the two data sets indicates that in a confined system the effective osmotic counter pressure to an applied mechanical pressure is much less than the osmotic pressure expected from the local polymer concentration...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of a lubricant layer at the polymer-metal die interface, when a blend of high density polyethylene (HDPE) and a fluoropolymer processing aid (Dynamar) was extruded through a slit die, was verified and investigated in depth. Blends containing 0. 5 and 5 wt% of Dynamar were prepared by a twin-counter-rotating-screw extruder. The viscosity of the blends was measured with a capillary rheometer. A specially made slit die block containing two pieces of insert was used. The inserts which could be taken out from the slit die block {{at the end of}} the measurement were separated from the <b>polymer</b> <b>block</b> by acid etching. The <b>polymer</b> <b>block</b> contains the information about the lubricant layer formed between the extrudate and the die wall. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS), secondary ion mass spectrometric (SIMS), and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analyses of the polymer blocks confirmed the presence of a Dynamar-rich lubricant layer at the interface between the extrudate and the die-wall surface. The thickness of the lubricant layer varied from 5 to 15 mu m depending on the shear rate and the concentration of the Dynamar in the blend. For the Dynamar concentrations and shear rates considered in this study, the efficiency of the viscosity reduction appears to be independent of the lubricant layer thickness...|$|E
40|$|Aqueous {{processing}} of globular protein–polymer diblock copolymers into solid-state materials and subsequent solvent annealing enables kinetic and thermodynamic control of nanostructure formation to produce block copolymer morphologies that maintain {{a high degree}} of protein fold and function. When model diblock copolymers composed of mCherry-b-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) are used, orthogonal control over solubility of the protein block through changes in pH and the <b>polymer</b> <b>block</b> through changes in temperature is demonstrated during casting and solvent annealing. Hexagonal cylinders, perforated lamellae, lamellae, or hexagonal and disordered micellar phases are observed, depending on the coil fraction of the block copolymer and the kinetic pathway used for self-assembly. Good solvents for the <b>polymer</b> <b>block</b> produce ordered structures reminiscent of coil–coil diblock copolymers, while an unfavorable solvent results in kinetically trapped micellar structures. Decreasing solvent quality for the protein improves long-range ordering, suggesting that the strength of protein interactions influences nanostructure formation. Subsequent solvent annealing results in evolution of the nanostructures, with the best ordering and the highest protein function observed when annealing in a good solvent for both blocks. While protein secondary structure was found to be almost entirely preserved for all processing pathways, UV–vis spectroscopy of solid-state films indicates that using a good solvent for the protein block enables up to 70 % of the protein to be retained in its functional form.

40|$|The {{self-assembly}} of globular protein-polymer diblock copolymers {{represents a}} promising technology for protein nanopatterning. The self-assembled materials {{have a high}} density of proteins and internal nanostructures that serve as continuous transport pathways for substrates, products, cofactors, and/or charges. The <b>polymer</b> <b>block</b> {{can act as a}} protective matrix for the protein, improving its stability and longevity in materials. The self-assembly of protein-polymer diblock copolymers is substantially different from that of traditional synthetic diblock copolymers due to the globular and rigid shape, heterogeneous composition, and anisotropic interactions of proteins. This thesis focuses on the control of nanostructures in self-assembled materials with a goal {{to gain a better understanding}} of the governing principles in self-assembly. This thesis presents experimental studies on the effect of modulated interactions between protein and polymers on the self-assembly of globular protein-polymer block copolymers. Bioconjugates composed of a model red fluorescent protein, mCherry, and a synthetic homopolymer with different chemical moieties are synthesized. Modulated interactions between protein and polymer by introducing polymer blocks with different hydrogen bonding capabilities change order-disorder transition concentrations in solution and the type of nanostructures formed. Bioconjugates with a weakly segregating <b>polymer</b> <b>block</b> are found to form a double gyroid structure with Ia 3 d symmetry, as opposed to perforated lamellae of bioconjugates with a strongly segregating <b>polymer</b> <b>block.</b> Common phase behaviors are also revealed, including the order of lyotropic order-order transitions and a re-entrant disordering behavior at high concentrations. Birefringence of the disordered solutions with increasing protein fraction suggests the formation of a nematic liquid crystalline phase arising from protein interactions. Self-assembly of proteinzwitterionic polymer bioconjugates shows that electrostatic segregation of mCherry constitutes one of the major driving forces for microphase separation. Nanostructures of the conjugates are further controlled by changing solvent selectivity. Important considerations in preparing bioconjugate thin films are also presented and discussed. Surface effects as well as kinetics such as solvent evaporation rate and film coating speed are shown to have a large impact on the long-range order of self-assembled nanostructures. by Dongsook Chang.

40|$|Inverse bicontinuous cubic (IBC) {{structures}} {{consisting of}} triply periodic minimal surfaces of block copolymers (BCPs) are emerging as materials of interest owing to their structural characteristics, which {{resemble those of}} their biological counterparts constructed from lipids. Solution self-assembly of amphiphilic BCPs with nonlinear architectures has recently been shown to form colloidal particles (polymer cubosomes) and macroscopic monoliths having mesoporous networks of water channels embedded in the periodic minimal surfaces of the BCP bilayers. Here we report that BCP architectures {{play a crucial role}} in controlling the packing parameter (P) of BCPs; a value greater than unity is a prerequisite for preferential self-assembly into IBC mesophases in solution. We show that the branched architecture of the <b>polymer</b> <b>blocks</b> constituting the BCP critically influences the structural parameters, such as the molecular area and, in particular, the critical length of the hydrophobic domain. Adjusting these structural parameters not only increases the P value of the BCP without depending on the asymmetry of the volume ratio of two <b>polymer</b> <b>blocks</b> (block ratio) but also dictates the lattice and periodicity of the resulting minimal surfaces of the BCPs.

40|$|Bioconjugates of {{the model}} red {{fluorescent}} protein mCherry and synthetic polymer blocks with different hydrogen bonding functionalities show that the chemistry of the <b>polymer</b> <b>block</b> has a large effect on both ordering transitions {{and the type of}} nanostructures formed during bioconjugate self-assembly. The phase behaviours of mCherry-b-poly(hydroxypropyl acrylate) (PHPA) and mCherry-b-poly(oligoethylene glycol acrylate) (POEGA) in concentrated aqueous solution show that changes in polymer chemistry result in increase in the order–disorder transition concentrations (C[subscript ODT]s) by approximately 10 – 15 wt% compared to a previously studied globular protein–polymer block copolymer, mCherry-b-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM). The C[subscript ODT]s are always minimized for symmetric bioconjugates, consistent with the importance of protein–polymer interactions in self-assembly. Both mCherry-b-PHPA and mCherry-b-POEGA also form phases that have not previously been observed in other globular protein–polymer conjugates: mCherry-b-PHPA forms a cubic phase that can be indexed to Ia[bar over 3]d and mCherry-b-POEGA displays coexistence of lamellae and a cubic Ia[bar over 3]d structure over a narrow range of concentration and temperature. Several common behaviours are also revealed by comparison of different polymer blocks. With increasing concentration and temperature, ordered phases always appear in the order lamellar, cubic/PL, and hexagonal, although not all phases are observed in all materials. High concentration solutions (near 80 wt%) also undergo a re-entrant order–disorder transition to form nematic liquid crystalline phases, regardless of the <b>polymer</b> <b>block</b> chemistry.
