50|$|In 1876 la Cour could {{demonstrate}} 12-fold telegraphy {{with his}} system, and the Great Nordic Telegraph Company {{was interested in}} it for some time. However, only the Danish Railroad Company seems to have used his invention in Denmark. After the disappointment on the American market, he produced a new invention, the <b>phonic</b> <b>wheel</b> - a synchronous motor driven by a tuning fork, which used an electromagnet to rotate the cogwheel of the motor by one tooth for each vibration. With two synchronous phonic wheels at a distance, a multitude of telegraphic devices was possible. This time there were no problems with the patent. The invention was produced in August 1875, patented in 1877, and the details {{were published in the}} book The <b>Phonic</b> <b>Wheel</b> in 1878 in a Danish and a French edition. At that time the invention was adopted by the American company The Delany Synchronous multiple Telegraph, and a new fight of priority arose. In 1886 the Franklin Institute awarded la Cour the John Scott Legacy Medal for the <b>phonic</b> <b>wheel</b> {{and at the same time}} presented Delany with the Elliott Cresson Medal for the synchronism, a decision la Cour protested against.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>phonic</b> <b>wheel</b> {{was used}} (in {{the form of}} Delany's {{multiplex}} telegraphy) on some telegraph lines on the East Coast of the U.S.A., and in the London Post Office. It {{was used as a}} chronometer, which was accurate to 0.00004 second in short time measurements. The most modern application was in the mechanical [...] "television" [...] of Paul Gottlieb Nipkow (1884).|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{design of a}} first {{approach}} of a test bench prototype for measuring friction in a piston-cylinder system is presented. The bench consists of a motor, belt and pulley transmission, crank mechanism, a piston, a cylinder and a lubrication system. Friction {{will be determined by}} means of strain gages placed on the connecting rod of the mechanism. The bench also includes a <b>phonic</b> <b>wheel</b> for acquiring angular speed and angular position signals of the crank. In future research, friction will be studied for different surface finishes obtained by means of honing and plateau honing. Honing processes provide a crosshatch pattern that holds oil and helps lubrication of piston and rings. Honing conditions will be selected with the goal of minimizing friction. Friction is directly related to energy consumption of an engine and, thus, to its environmental impact. Keywords: test bench, friction, piston-cylinder system, honing, roughness.

50|$|The Chord Organ {{was first}} {{introduced}} by the Hammond Organ Company in 1950. It was invented primarily by John M. Hanert, who was Hammond's primary musical engineer at the time. He had previously developed the Novachord and Solovox, two instruments which used vacuum-tube circuitry rather than tone or <b>phonic</b> <b>wheels</b> to generate the tones as in a Hammond Organ.|$|R
40|$|The present {{paper offers}} {{the chance to}} {{experimentally}} measure, for the first time, the internal tire strain by optical fiber sensors during the tire rolling in real operating conditions. The phenomena that take place during the tire rolling are in fact far from being completely understood. Despite several models available in the technical literature, {{there is not a}} correspondently large set of experimental observations. The paper includes the detailed description of the new multi-sensing technology for an ongoing vehicle measurement, which the research group has developed {{in the context of the}} project OPTYRE. The experimental apparatus is mainly based on the use of optical fibers with embedded Fiber Bragg Gratings sensors for the acquisition of the circumferential tire strain. Other sensors are also installed on the tire, such as a <b>phonic</b> <b>wheel,</b> a uniaxial accelerometer, and a dynamic temperature sensor. The acquired information is used as input variables in dedicated algorithms that allow the identification of key parameters, such as the dynamic contact patch, instantaneous dissipation and instantaneous grip. The OPTYRE project brings a contribution into the field of experimental grip monitoring of wheeled vehicles, with implications both on passive and active safety characteristics of cars and motorbikes...|$|E
