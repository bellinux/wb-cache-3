On the one hand, the <b>physical</b> <b>part</b> <b>consists</b> {{of a large}} number of subsystems which exhibit predominantly continuous dynamics, sometimes with (infrequent) discontinuities. On the other hand, the distributed computerised control systems constitute complex discretetime and discrete-event systems that require completely different modelling and simulation methods. For an evaluation of the behaviour and the performance of the overall system, both types of models have to be combined and simulated efficiently. This contribution presents the requirements for a modelling environment for such systems and discusses an approach that consists of object-oriented modelling and efficient simulation of the physical part using the physical systems modelling language MODELICA, a software environment for the definition of discrete-event models using various formalisms, and the integration of both parts of the system via model translation. The coordination of both parts is performed by the MODELICA simulator. The modelling environment called DES/M (discrete-event systems for Modelica) supports the interoperation of different domain specific discrete-event formalisms. To illustrate the usage of the environment, a laboratory batch plant model is presented. A more elaborate example is described in another contribution in this volume (Mosterman et al., 2002). ...|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss a}} mapping {{procedure}} from {{a space of}} colorless three-quark clusters into a space of elementary baryons and illustrate {{it in the context}} of a three-color extension of the Lipkin model recently developed. Special attention is addressed to the problem of the formation of unphysical states in the mapped space. A correspondence is established between quark and baryon spaces and the baryon image of a generic quark operator is defined both in its Hermitian and non-Hermitian forms. Its spectrum (identical in the two cases) is found to <b>consist</b> of a <b>physical</b> <b>part</b> containing the same eigenvalues of the quark operator in the cluster space and an unphysical <b>part</b> <b>consisting</b> only of zero eigenvalues. A physical subspace of the baryon space is also defined where the latter eigenvalues are suppressed. The procedure discussed is quite general and applications of it can be thought also in the correspondence between systems of 2 n fermions and n bosons. Comment: 22 pages, LateX, to appear in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
50|$|This book divides {{settlement}} {{into three}} parts and release into two parts. Settlement: The first <b>part</b> <b>consists</b> of a settlement by admission of the defendant. The second <b>part</b> <b>consists</b> of a settlement by denial of the defendant. The third <b>part</b> <b>consists</b> of a settlement by {{the silence of the}} defendant consequent upon the absence of any admission or denial. Release: The first <b>part</b> <b>consists</b> of release by way of renunciation of a right. The second consists of release by admission of payment. This book includes chapters dealing with conclusion of a contract of settlement and release, the consideration and subject matter of the settlement, {{the subject matter of the}} settlement, and fundamental conditions governing settlement and release.|$|R
