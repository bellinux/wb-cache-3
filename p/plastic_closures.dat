40|$|Abstract. Using the PRO-E {{to build}} the 3 D model of <b>plastic</b> <b>closures</b> and analyze the main {{shortages}} of the <b>plastic</b> <b>closures</b> and the corresponding countermeasures; the influencing factors like the polymer injection location, the pressure, the temperature and {{the time in the}} <b>plastic</b> <b>closures</b> molding process are studied in this paper based on Moldflow. The injection closures molding parameters, such as the pressure maintaining, the cooling, and the bucking deformation are optimized with numerical simulation. 1 Introducation The injection molding is an important plastic products molding method which is suitable for mass production of plastic products of complex shapes and accurate sizes. The closures of drinking bottles, as taking plastic as the material, have a certain request on the precision and a big demand of quantity, and they are usually in batch production, so the injection molding is the preferred molding method. In the <b>plastic</b> <b>closures</b> molding process, the technological parameters will directly influence the melt flow conditions in the mould {{and the quality of the}} final products, so the premise of molding high-quality products is to get and keep optimized technological parameters. As CAE technology is applied more frequently in the <b>plastic</b> <b>closures</b> injection molding process, the problem of how to get useful information from the CAE analysis results to optimize the process is important to the products quality [1] Moldflow injection molding CAE software can realize the optimal design of the model cavity size, the polymer injection location and its size, the runner size and the cooling system. To make mould trial and mould repair on the computer can improve the quality of mould, reduce the frequency of mould trial, and help the engineering technical personnel to determine the optimal injection pressure, the clamping force, the mould temperature, the melt temperature, the injection time, the dwell pressure, the dwell time and the cooling time to make the best plastic products by injection molding [2...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{confidential}} until 31 st May 2018. A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial fulfilment {{of the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Integrally moulded hinges and tension bands are important features in packaging components for <b>plastic</b> <b>closures</b> and their function is critically dependent on the flow induced micromorphology in the hinge section. Polymer characteristics and processing of the hinge also have an influence on the hinge properties obtained. This study is aimed at obtaining interrelationships between polymer characteristics, in-cavity flow, microstructure development and hinge properties, to produce hinges with enhanced functional properties. Three different virgin polypropylene (PP) grades were investigated (homopolymer PP-H, random copolymer PP-RC and impact copolymer PP-IC) and injection moulding simulation was carried out using Moldflow software. In-cavity data acquisition {{has been carried out}} for different sets of injection moulding conditions, using high performance transducers and a data acquisition system. A comparison between Moldflow simulation and practical injection moulding data suggests that, for thin wall injection moulded components the real time pressure data are in close agreement during the injection stage. During the packing stage there is some disagreement between these data, since the thickness of hinge and tension band sections are 0. 4 mm and 0. 5 mm respectively, suggesting that these dimensions are extending the capability of the software. An extensive study using a design of experiments (DoE) approach was carried out on both practical and predictive data. Injection velocity and melt temperature were the most influential factors on the component mechanical properties. From the optical micrographs it is observed that PP-RC has a finer micro-structure compared to PP-H and PP-IC and some micrographs confirm Moldflow simulation results in which hesitation effects are evident, as the flow converges into the thin hinge and tension band sections. PP-clay nanocomposites (PP-CN) were prepared using a twin screw compounder. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has shown some evidence of dispersion and exfoliation of the clay particles in the PP matrix. However, X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show a reduction in inter-layer spacing of PPCN s possibly due to clay compaction. The addition of nano-clay however has not resulted in any significant improvements in the mechanical properties of hinges and tension bands. The high degree of molecular orientation induced in the hinge and tension-band sections appears to mask any improvements attributed to the addition of nano-clay. From the reprocessed and post consumer recyclate (PCR) study conducted on hinges and tension bands, it is seen that with an increase in both the re-processing and PCR content there is a decrease in the component strength of around 14...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{evaluate}} {{the efficiency of}} topical negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) compared with standard therapy for the regeneration of the soft tissues of the lower extremities in patients with diabetic foot syndrome. Materials and Methods The effects of negative pressure therapy on the clinical (size, tissue oxygenation), histological (light microscopy) and immunohistochemical (CD 68, MMP- 9, TIMP- 1) aspects of repair of the soft tissue of the lower extremities in patients with diabetes mellitus were {{compared with those of}} standard treatment. Thirty-one patients with diabetic foot ulcers were included in the study from the moment of debridement until the <b>plastic</b> <b>closure</b> of the wound. During the perioperative period, 13 patients received NPWT (- 90 to - 120 mmHg) and 18 patients received standard therapy. Results A reduction of the wound area (26. 6 %± 17. 2 %) and the depth of the defects (40. 5 %± 25. 6 %) were achieved with negative pressure therapy compared with baseline data. In the control group, the corresponding values were 25. 3 %± 19. 4 % and 21. 8 %± 21. 6 %, respectively. The results of transcutaneous oximetry showed a greater increase in the level of local hemodynamics in the study group (p < 0. 04). An important criterion for wound preparation for a <b>plastic</b> <b>closure</b> is filling it with granulation tissue by more than 75 %. In the study group, 95 % of patients had wounds filled with 89. 9 %± 17 % of abundant granulation tissue. The histological data of the study group show a significant reduction of oedema by 80 % (p < 0. 05), improved extracellular matrix organization (p < 0. 05), 90 % (p < 0. 05) dissolution of inflammatory infiltrate and the formation of healthy granulation tissue (p < 0. 05). Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a significant {{decrease in the number of}} macrophages in the dermis (CD 68 expression) (p < 0. 05). In both groups, the level of MMP- 9 was decreased. However, the ratio of MMP- 9 :TIMP- 1 was lower in the study group (p < 0. 05). Conclusion The findings suggest that negative pressure therapy (- 90 to - 120 mmHg) is more efficient compared with standard treatment and achieves more rapid reduction of the area and depth of the wound, increased local microcirculation and decreased inflammation. These findings were confirmed histologically and immunohistochemically. The high efficiency of this method significantly reduced the time required for preparing the wound for the next surgical treatment. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{minimize}} surgical {{trauma in}} patients with head and neck tumors during microsurgical plasty with visceral autografts. Subjects and methods. Clinical experience has been gained {{in the treatment of}} 53 patients with locally advanced craniofascial (n = 27) and oropharyngeal (n = 36) cancers. Abdominal organs were used for <b>plastic</b> <b>closure</b> of extensive defects after surgical resection. Paraumbilical incision allowing for an adequate approach into the abdominal cavity with minimal external trauma in the anterior abdominal wall was chosen as an access procedure. Video-assisted techniques were used to excise the midline aponeurosis. Donor organs, such as the omentum, greater curvature of the stomach, transverse colon, small intestine) were taken through a mini-laparotomic incision to the anterior abdominal wall, then the vascular pedicle was exposed and a visceral autograft was made. After forming and cutting off the autograft, organ anastomoses were created extracorporeally. Results. Mini-access surgery could be completed in 50 of the 53 cases (4 patients had previously undergone abdominal interventions). Omental (n = 26), colo-omental (n = 15), gastro-omental (n = 7), and entero-omental (n = 5) flaps were made and prepared for autografting. No intra- or postoperative abdominal complications were found. Conclusion. Minimally invasive technologies used to create visceral authografts for head and neck tissue repair can minimize surgical trauma and reduce treatment duration. The indications for this access are the debilitating state of a cancer patient or the young age of a patient who does not wish to have an additional scar in the donor region. </p...|$|R
