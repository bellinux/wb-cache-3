5|$|Part of the <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> {{quoted in}} {{an episode of}} Penny Dreadful, when Lucifer appears to Vanessa Ives to tempt her, and quotes the poem in his conversation.|$|E
5|$|Tennyson {{originally}} {{blocked out}} the poem in four paragraphs, broken before lines 6, 33 and 44. In this structure, {{the first and}} third paragraphs are thematically parallel, but may be read as interior and exterior monologues, respectively. However, the <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> often printed with the first paragraph break omitted.|$|E
5|$|The <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> a lyrical {{description}} {{of the life of}} a tribe he was living with along the Amazon river. While it has echoes of Tennyson in the rhymes and rhythms the poem itself is not overly Romantic, serving more as a tool to set the scene and then draw contrast between {{the lives of the people}} living here and those in England. The <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> a comment on savagery and greed, making the point that some in England were more 'savage' than those on the Amazon, either by a greed for gold or by their greed for gold driving others into poverty.|$|E

5|$|Tolkien {{argues that}} the {{original}} poem has almost been lost {{under the weight of}} the scholarship on it; that Beowulf must be seen as a poem, not just as a historical document; and that the quality of its verse and its structure give it a powerful effect. He rebuts suggestions that the <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> an epic or exciting narrative, likening it instead to a strong masonry structure built of blocks that fit together. He points out that the poem's theme is a serious one, mortality, and that the <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> in two parts: the first on Beowulf as a young man, defeating Grendel and his mother; the second on Beowulf in old age, going to his death fighting the dragon.|$|E
5|$|Burnt Norton is {{the first}} poem of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets. He created it while working on his play Murder in the Cathedral and it was first {{published}} in his Collected Poems 1909–1935 (1936). The poem's title refers to a Cotswolds manor house Eliot visited. The manor's garden served as an important image within the poem. Structurally, the <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> based on Eliot's The Waste Land with passages of the poem related to those excised from Murder in the Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|Coleridge {{began work}} on The Eolian Harp in August 1795 during his {{engagement}} to Sara Fricker. It details their future union and was inspired by {{his visit to the}} house in Clevedon that would serve as their home after their wedding.

5|$|In Belgium, the In Flanders Fields Museum in Ypres, {{named after}} the poem and devoted to the First World War, is {{situated}} in one of Flanders' largest tourist areas.

5|$|In {{describing}} the narrator's analysis of his surroundings, Gray employed John Locke's {{philosophy of the}} sensations, which argued that the senses were the origin of ideas. Information described {{in the beginning of}} the <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> reused by the narrator as he contemplates life near the end. The description of death and obscurity adopts Locke's political philosophy as it emphasises the inevitability and finality of death. The end of the <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> connected to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in that the beginning of the poem deals with the senses and the ending describes how we are limited in our ability to understand the world. The poem takes the ideas and transforms them into a discussion of blissful ignorance by adopting Locke's resolution to be content with our limited understanding. Unlike Locke, the narrator of the poem knows that he is unable to fathom the universe, but still questions the matter.|$|E

50|$|Later when Wolfgang grew up, he {{purified}} {{his creation}} by destroying many <b>poems</b> that <b>were</b> irrelevant {{to that time}} period. In Wolfgang’s eyes, {{what was left of}} his <b>poems</b> <b>were</b> not of high quality. Therefore, what survived from his <b>poems</b> <b>were</b> mostly included in his letters to Aline Bussmann, Ruth Hager, Carl Albert Lange and Hugo Seiker. Those <b>poems</b> <b>were</b> not to be published, or at least that was the intention of Borchert. However, in 1960, his mother Hertha Borchert and the American Stanley Tschopp gathered around two hundred <b>poems</b> to <b>be</b> published but that did not happen until 1996 when Allein mit meinem Schattten und dem Mond , a compiled selection of Wolfgang Borchert’s <b>poems,</b> <b>was</b> published.|$|R

5|$|In the manuscript, the <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> called Romans de la Rose (l. 11), {{and hence}} Le Roman de la Rose, {{but it is}} often {{referred}} to as Roman de la Rose, or Guillaume de Dole in order to avoid confusion with Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun's Roman de la Rose; Guillaume de Dole is a subtitle added by Fauchet.|$|E
5|$|Many modern {{scholars}} {{contend that}} the seemingly Christian nature of the <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> due to Virgil referencing Eastern oracles, {{which may have been}} influenced by Jewish texts and prophecies. For instance, Robin Nisbet, after carefully analyzing the work, ultimately concluded that Virgil probably appropriated some elements used in the poem from Jewish mythology by means of Eastern oracles, and later adapted them towards Western (which is to say, Roman) modes of thought.|$|E
5|$|Other images, such as Thalaba {{reclaiming}} his father's magic sword, are {{symbols that}} effectively reinforce Southey's moral themes. However, these events represent the {{minority of the}} plot and are rarely relied on early in the story. To the contrary, the heavily represented magic ring is used to protect Thalaba with little explanation as to how it works {{and there is no}} moral statements tied to its use. As a whole, the <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> able to portray scenery and events in strongly descriptive manners, but the manner in doing this takes away from their meaning and effect. In terms of religious imagery, Islam within the <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> more similar to Zoroastrian thought and morality. Other religious images lose their power as Southey removes any mystical aspects of them, including Simorgh being stripped of it being a symbol of harmony with life. In terms of the divine, there is a dual entity: Allah representing preservation and Eblis representing destruction. However, evil, though an opposite to good, is never explained but merely used to further the plot.|$|E

50|$|Middle Indo-Aryan Languages {{are still}} {{synthetic}} like Old Indo-Aryan Languages but diphthongs and harsh combination of consonants were dropped, {{so much so}} that in the literary development these Prakrits became absolutely fluid.

Sankrit <b>poems</b> <b>are</b> harsh but Prakrit <b>poems</b> <b>are</b> very smooth.|$|R
5|$|Poetry {{is often}} {{separated}} into lines on a page. These lines may {{be based on}} the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone. See the article on line breaks for information about the division between lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{animal was}} {{examined}} by scholars and the curious, and letters describing the fantastic creature {{were sent to}} correspondents throughout Europe.
