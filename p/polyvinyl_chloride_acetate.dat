5000|$|<b>Polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>acetate</b> (PVCA) is a {{thermoplastic}} copolymer of {{vinyl chloride}} and vinyl acetate. [...] It {{is used in}} the manufacture of electrical insulation, of protective coverings (including garments), and of credit cards and swipe cards.|$|E
50|$|It can be {{polymerized}} to give {{polyvinyl acetate}} (PVA). With other monomers {{can be used}} to prepare copolymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), vinyl acetate-acrylic acid (VA/AA), <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>acetate</b> (PVCA), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (Vp/Va Copolymer, used in hair gels). Due to the instability of the radical, attempts to control the polymerization via most 'living/controlled' radical processes have proved problematic. However, RAFT (or more specifically MADIX) polymerization offers a convenient method of controlling the synthesis of PVA by the addition of a xanthate or a dithiocarbamate chain transfer agent.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] {{conservation}} and restoration of vinyl discs {{refers to the}} preventive measures taken to defend against damage and slow degradation, and to maintain fidelity of singles, 12" [...] singles, EP, LP in 45 or 33⅓ rpm disc recordings. LPs are most often in the 12” format, although very early vinyl recordings were 10”. Vinyl LP preservation is generally considered separate from conservation, which refers to the repair and stabilization of individual discs. Commonly practiced in major sound archives and research libraries that house large collections of audio recordings, it is also frequently followed by audiophiles and home record collectors. Because vinyl—a virtually unbreakable light plastic made up of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>acetate</b> copolymer, or PVC—is considered the most stable of analog recording media, {{it is seen as}} less a concern for deterioration than earlier sound recordings made from more fragile materials such as acetate, vulcanite, or shellac. This hardly means that vinyl recordings are infallible, however, and research—both expert and evidential—has shown that the way in which discs are handled and cared for can {{have a profound effect on}} their longevity. Though some 45s (7”s) are also made from vinyl, many of them are actually polystyrene—a more fragile medium that is prone to fracturing from internal stress. Still, many of the recommendations for the care of vinyl LPs can be applied to 45s.|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{knowledge of}} the condensed phase chemistry occurring in polymers exposed to elevated temperatures is crucial to understanding the behaviour of polymers exposed to fire. This is particularly true when trying to reduce polymer flammability by means of promoting char-forming reactions. Until recently, however, structural information on highly crosslinked chars and their precursors {{has been difficult to}} obtain, and as a consequence many degradation workers have merely labelled degradation residues as 'intractable'. However, the application of solid state NMR techniques developed in our laboratories for the structural characterisation of coals has provided a considerable insight into the structure and chemistry of polymer chars formed under both oxidative and non-oxidative conditions. A series of polymers including <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>chloride),</b> <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>acetate),</b> polyurethanes, polychloropene, cis and trans polyisoprene have been studied. These polymers have been used to describe the application of quantitative sup 1 sup 3 C NMR and high temperature broadline sup 1 H NMR to polymer degradation, showing how these techniques can complement more conventional methods such as DSC, FTIR and evolved gas analysis. It was shown that these techniques can provide a striking insight into the condensed phase degradation chemistry occurring in a real fire. It has been shown by sup 1 sup 3 C NMR dipolar dephasing experiments that chars produced from the degradation of <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>chloride)</b> and <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>acetate)</b> are similar in nature in that they are comprised of a network of, on average, di-substituted phenyl rings, while chars produced from polychloroprene degradation are comprised of a network of, on average tri-substituted phenyl rings. For polyurethanes, sup 1 H NMR provided evidence that the fire retardant melamine acted in the condensed phase resulting in increased char yield...|$|R
30|$|Our {{attempt was}} {{to set up}} a {{membrane}} system of adequate chemical, thermal and mechanical stability. So, to acquire such membranes, the selection of binder is also of immense importance. Easily available polystyrene is found to be an appropriate binder as its cross-linked rigid framework provides adequate adhesion to the molecules of cobalt carbonate which accounts for the higher mechanical stability to the membrane over other binders like <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride,</b> cellulose <b>acetate,</b> etc. So, a polystyrene blended cobalt carbonate membrane results in more favourable thermal and mechanical stabilities provided by the inorganic part and furnishes good flexibility due to the organic component, i.e. polystyrene-supported cobalt carbonate nanocomposite membrane can be a potential and better candidate than many conventional membranes which degrade under harsh conditions frequently encountered in various industrial settings. Furthermore, it appears to be efficient and cost-effective material having solvent resistance and thermal resistance characteristics [15].|$|R
40|$|Micrometre-sized {{porous polymer}} {{particles}} were fabricated by amination of chlorinated aliphatic polymer beads (chlorinated polypropylene (CPP), chlorinated polyethylene (CPE), and <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> co-vinyl <b>acetate</b> (PVCVAc)) in aqueous amine (polyethylenimine (PEI) and triethylamine (TEA)) solution. The polymer particles obtained {{were characterized by}} SEM, elemental analysis, titration, N 2 adsorption, FT-IR, solid-state NMR and thermogravimetry (TG). CPP-PEI, CPE-PEI, and PVCVAc-PEI had honeycomb-like pores whereas rugged textures with pores were developed in CPP-TEA, and skeleton-like pores were formed in PVCVAc-TEA. Aminated samples exhibit a BET surface area of 4 - 12 m 2 g- 1 and an anion exchange capacity of 1. 10 to 4. 27 mmol g- 1. The membranes fabricated with CPP-PEI and PVCVAc-PEI exhibited ionic conductivities as high as 4. 5 × 10 - 2 and 0. 48 × 10 - 2 S cm- 1, respectively.

40|$|A {{new kind}} of optical sensor for {{monitoring}} dissolved ammonia uses rhodamines immobilized in thin membranes made from ethylcellulose, <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>chloride)</b> or <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>acetate).</b> The response to ammonia {{is the result of}} a change in the molecular structure of the rhodamine. On exposure to ammonia, the rhodamine is converted to a colorless and non-fluorescent lactone. As a result, fluorescence intensity is reduced. The polymer not only has a strong effect on the limits of detection, but also on the response time. Typical LODs are 0. 1 μg ml− 1 for ethylcellulose and <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>chloride),</b> but as low as 10 μg ml− 1 for poly(vinyl acetate). The last membranes provide highest sensitivity and lowest detection limits, but are not suitable for online monitoring of ammonia because they respond irreversibly.

40|$|The {{miscibility}} behaviour of blends of poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) with <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>chloride)</b> (PVC), <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>acetate)</b> (PVAc) and vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate (VCVAc) copolymer {{has been}} investigated {{on the basis of}} a viscometric approach. PVP is found to be miscible with PVC over the entire composition range, as is evident from the high values observed for the intrinsic viscosity of transfer. This is further supported by the single glass transition temperature observed in differential scanning calorimetry studies of the blend films. Blends of PVP with VCVAc copolymer exhibit microphase separation which is shown clearly in the scanning electron micrographs of the films. PVAc/PVP blends show interaction only at low PVAc contents, but in general are immiscible...|$|R
50|$|When {{selecting}} packaging films (web substrates) for EMAP {{of fruits}} and vegetables the main characteristics to consider are gas permeability, water vapour transmission rate, mechanical properties, transparency, type of package and sealing reliability. Traditionally used packaging films like LDPE (low-density polyethylene), PVC (<b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride),</b> EVA (ethylene-vinyl <b>acetate)</b> and OPP (oriented polypropylene) are not permeable enough for highly respiring products like fresh-cut produce, mushrooms and broccoli. As fruits and vegetables are respiring products, {{there is a need to}} transmit gases through the film. Films designed with these properties are called permeable films. Other films, called barrier films, are designed to prevent the exchange of gases and are mainly used with non-respiring products like meat and fish.|$|R
50|$|The {{composition}} of vinyl used to press records (a blend of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> and <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>acetate)</b> has varied considerably over the years. Virgin vinyl is preferred, {{but during the}} 1970s energy crisis, it became commonplace to use recycled vinyl. Sound quality suffered, with increased ticks, pops and other surface noises. Other experiments included reducing the thickness of LPs, leading to warping and increased susceptibility to damage. Using a biscuit of 130 grams of vinyl had been the standard, but some labels experimented with as little as 90 grams per LP. Today, high fidelity pressings follow the Japanese standard of 160, 180 or 200 grams.Compare these to the original Columbia 12 inch LP's (ml 4001) at around 220 grams each.Besides the standard black vinyl, specialty records are also pressed on different colors of PVC/A or picture discs with a card picture sandwiched between two clear sides. Records in different novelty shapes are also produced.|$|R

40|$|In {{structurally}} participating formworks, a new forming {{technique for}} reinforced concrete, {{referred to as}} stay-in-place formwork has recently emerged as a viable technique. This permanent new formwork system simplifies the construction process and reduces construction time. Two materials that are well-suited for this technique are fiber reinforced polymer and <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride.</b> This research presents a non-linear and three-dimensional finite element model for reinforced concrete walls with and without <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> stay-in-place formwork. There is a variety of commercial programs for three-dimensional finite element modelling, but they lack the ability to model a complex composite material such as reinforced concrete encased in a <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> stay-in-place forming system. For its high performance and extensive range of material modelling capabilities, the ABAQUS finite element package {{was used in the}} current study. Concrete was modelled using a concrete damage plasticity model, and steel bars were modelled using an elastic and perfectly plastic material. Perfect bond was assumed between concrete and steel. The <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> stay-in-place formwork was modelled using an elasto-plastic material. As with the concrete and steel, perfect bond was assumed between the <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> panels and the concrete. Finite element results were validated using experimental results reported by Scott (2014). It was observed from the comparison that the proposed non-linear fine element model is capable of predicting the load capacity for the reinforced concrete walls with and without the <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> stay-in-place formwork. Predicted yield loads were in good agreement with the experimental data, with an average error of 6 % for control walls, 7 % for the <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> encased reinforced concrete walls with flat panels, and 3 % for the walls encased with hollow panels. In addition, finite element ultimate (peak) loads showed good correlation with the experimental data. The average error for the control, flat panel and hollow panel encased walls were 3 %, 3 % and 13 %, respectively. A parametric study was conducted to investigate the effect of concrete compressive strength, thickness of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> stay-in-place formwork, and the strength of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> used in stay-in-place formworks. It was observed that the concrete compressive strength has a significant effect on the flexural strength of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> encased reinforced concrete walls.

40|$|Thermodynamic {{principles}} and some {{applications of the}} temperature gradient interaction chromatography (TGIC) recently developed for the characterization of synthetic polymers are described. TGIC {{is a form of}} high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) that varies column temperature in a programmed manner to control the retention of polymeric species during isocratic elution. The retention of polymers strongly depends on their molecular weights, and the polymers are well separated by TGIC in terms of their molecular weights. TGIC is superior to size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in resolution and sample loading capacity, and has higher sensitivity to molecular weight in the analysis of nonlinear polymers. TGIC has an advantage over solvent gradient HPLC because it permits the use of refractive index sensitive detection method such as differential refractometry and light scattering due to the isocratic elution. In addition, temperature provides finer and more reproducible retention control than the solvent composition, which is important in determining the molecular weight distribution by secondary calibration methods. With TGIC analysis, we found that the molecular weight distribution of anionically polymerized polymers is much narrower than has been generally accepted from SEC analysis. We also found the TGIC separation conditions for polystyrene, polyisoprene, poly(methyl methacrylate), <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>chloride),</b> and <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>acetate)</b> over wide molecular weight range. Because of its sensitivity to the molecular weight alone, TGIC was successfully applied to the characterization of star shaped polystyrene, and the detailed linking kinetics between living polystyrene anions and a chlorosilane linking agent was investigated. open 879...|$|R

Cyclic olefin copolymer is shown to have properties which result in fewer environmental concerns and also can provide the added benefit of an improved barrier to moisture permeation when compared to <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> film. This paper documents a summary of the data on both sides of the <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> environmental debate.
