500|$|Reaction to the [...] "feud" [...] by {{both the}} public and the media was, and still is, nearly uniformly positive. Clips from the feud quickly became popular on the Internet, turning into viral videos that spread across {{numerous}} blogs in various forms, with the sites that offered the videos seeing vast increases in their traffic. The Huckabee brawl became [...] "so popular that polls [...] <b>popping</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> pursuit of the public's opinion to the question, 'Who made Huckabee?'."

500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} [...] "Saw VI is the thinnest, draggiest, and most tediously preachy of the Saw films. It's {{the first one}} that's more or less {{consumed}} by backstory—which is to say, it's one of those hollow franchise placeholders in which far too many fragments from the previous sequels keep <b>popping</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> flashbacks." [...] He said, [...] "If {{your goal is to}} do a quick study for a round of Saw Trivial Pursuit, then this may be the movie for you. If you're looking to be jolted into fear or queasy laughter, skip this sequel and hope that the producers get their sick act together next time." [...] Rob Nelson of Variety wrote, [...] "Squeezing another pint of blood from its torture-porn corpus, Lionsgate slays again with Saw VI, a film so frighteningly familiar it could well be called 'Saw It Already'. At least the requisite moralism is more playful than pious in this edition", but added, [...] "Presumably owing to director Kevin Greutert's work as editor of all five previous Saw pics, the film's juggling of chronology is the franchise's best...." [...] Christopher Monfette of IGN Movies rated Saw VI three out of five and wrote that [...] "while Saw VI certainly offers a redemption for the series and the promise of a coming power struggle for Jigsaw's legacy, Saw Ⅶ will no doubt mark the time to either shake things up or watch this franchise get the ax".|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{campaign}} for Wired.com, Emma Grey Ellis called it [...] "a relentless marketing siege of every platform you would think of—and some you didn’t ... as crazy and unrelenting as it all is, isn’t this exactly what we want from Deadpool?" [...] Bobby Anhalt at Screen Rant called it possibly [...] "the best film marketing campaign {{in the history of}} cinema", and noted that Deadpool's fourth wall breaking allowed [...] "the marketing team [...] make stunts that appear as though the character himself is crafting them." [...] HostGator's Jeremy Jensen attributed {{the campaign}}'s success to Reynolds, as well as Fox embracing the film's R rating. He concluded that, [...] "More than anything the Deadpool marketing campaign managed to create a relationship with the people who ended up going to see it. They were honest, creative, and completely relentless." [...] Alisha Grauso of Forbes felt the campaign's success came from the marketing team understanding the character, having freedom from the usual creative constraints put on film marketers, and not revealing much of the film's actual content. Grauso also praised the marketing team for utilizing Reynolds, and said, [...] "Audiences have been more than ready for the weird and wild, and that's the point—Fox was smart enough to see that and run with it. Most marketing campaigns don't give audiences credit for being all that intelligent or open-minded, but {{the campaign for}} Deadpool didn't hold back ... was just like the character himself. Unpredictable, non sequitur, hilarious, perverse, and <b>popping</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the strangest of places." ...|$|E

2500|$|Danny Dallas (Ted Wass)—Mary Campbell's eldest son. Sweet-natured, good-looking but not {{particularly}} bright, he is a low-level gangster {{due to his}} late father's membership, not due to any aptitude or desire of his own. He is given the task of killing his stepfather Burt, but can't bring himself to, {{and as a result}} spends most of Season 1 on the run, <b>popping</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> ludicrous disguises. It is widely assumed that he is the son of Mary's first husband Johnny Dallas but in later episodes it is revealed that his real father is Chester Tate (born from an illicit affair Chester had with his mother, Mary). He is very protective of his younger half-brother Jodie, but is initially in denial about Jodie's homosexuality. Danny is forced to marry Elaine, the mob boss's daughter. He eventually falls in love with her; she was later kidnapped and killed. Danny later gets involved in a series of failed relationships, including a girlfriend of one of Elaine's kidnappers, an African-American woman, a prostitute, and Chester's new wife, Annie. When Chester finds them [...] in bed together, he plans to shoot them both (this was a series cliffhanger). [...] Danny also becomes Burt's enthusiastic but inept deputy sheriff.|$|E

60|$|He had {{of course}} thus {{left it to}} her and he was {{wondering}} more about it now than he had wondered there in Brook Street. He repeated to himself that if it wasn't {{in the line of}} triumph it was in the line of muddle. This indeed, no doubt, was as a part of his wonder for still other questions. Kate had really got off without meeting his little challenge about the terms of their intercourse with her dear Milly. Her dear Milly, it was sensible, was somehow in the picture. Her dear Milly, <b>popping</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his absence, occupied--he couldn't have said quite why he felt it--more of the foreground than one would have expected her in advance to find clear. She took up room, and {{it was almost as if}} room had been made for her. Kate had appeared to take for granted he would know why it had been made; but that was just the point. It was a foreground in which he himself, in which his connexion with Kate, scarce enjoyed a space to turn round. But Miss Theale was perhaps at the present juncture a possibility of the same sort as the softened, if not the squared, Aunt Maud. It might be true of her also that if she weren't a bore she'd be a convenience. It rolled over him of a sudden, after he had resumed his walk, that this might easily be what Kate had meant. The charming girl adored her--Densher had for himself made out that--and would protect, would lend a hand, to their interviews. These might take place, in other words, on her premises, which would remove them still better from the streets. That was an explanation which did hang together. It was impaired a little, of a truth, by this fact that their next encounter was rather markedly not to depend upon her. Yet this fact in turn would be accounted for by the need of more preliminaries. One of the things he conceivably should gain on Thursday at Lancaster Gate would be a further view of that propriety.|$|E
