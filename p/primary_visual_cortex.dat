This distribution results in complex action of the muscarinic receptors in the integration of visual stimuli. Selective activation of the different subtypes can either strengthen or weaken cortical connectivity (e. g., thalamocortical vs. corticocortical), i. e., it can influence the processing of certain stimuli over others. Moreover, muscarinic receptors differentially modulate some functional properties of neurons during experience-dependent activity and cognitive processes and they contribute to the fine-tuning of visual processing.

25|$|In 2012, Crupi, Pradhan and Tozer {{described}} a {{proof of concept}} design to create neural synaptic memory circuits using organic ion-based memristors. The synapse circuit demonstrated long-term potentiation for learning as well as inactivity based forgetting. Using a grid of circuits, a pattern of light was stored and later recalled. This mimics {{the behavior of the}} V1 neurons in the <b>primary</b> <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> that act as spatiotemporal filters that process visual signals such as edges and moving lines.|$|E
25|$|The ventral stream {{gets its}} main {{input from the}} parvocellular (as opposed to magnocellular) layer of the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. These neurons project to V1 sublayers 4Cβ, 4A, 3B and 2/3a successively. From there, the ventral pathway goes through V2 and V4 to areas of the {{inferior}} temporal lobe: PIT (posterior inferotemporal), CIT (central inferotemporal), and AIT (anterior inferotemporal). Each visual area contains a full representation of visual space. That is, it contains neurons whose receptive fields together represent the entire visual field. Visual information enters the ventral stream through the <b>primary</b> <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> and travels {{through the rest of}} the areas in sequence.|$|E
25|$|This strong {{assumption}} was first studied in 1996 by Boynton and colleagues, who checked {{the effects on}} the <b>primary</b> <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> of patterns flickering 8times a second and presented for 3 to 24seconds. Their result showed that when visual contrast of the image was increased, the HDR shape stayed the same but its amplitude increased proportionally. With some exceptions, responses to longer stimuli could also be inferred by adding together the responses for multiple shorter stimuli summing to the same longer duration. In 1997, Dale and Buckner tested whether individual events, rather than blocks of some duration, also summed the same way, and found they did. But they also found deviations from the linear model at time intervals less than 2seconds.|$|E

In this chapter, we review that framework and we extend it to develop a new model for the computation and representation of velocity information in the visual system.

5000|$|The ocular {{dominance}} columns {{cover the}} <b>primary</b> (striate) <b>visual</b> <b>cortex,</b> {{with the exception}} of monocular regions of the cortical map corresponding to peripheral vision and the blind spot. If the columns corresponding to one eye were colored, a pattern similar to that shown in the accompanying figure would be visible when looking at the surface of the cortex. However, the same region of cortex could also be colored by the direction of edge that it responds to, resulting in the orientation columns, which are laid out in a characteristic pinwheel shape. Similarly, there are columns in the cortex that have high levels of the protein cytochrome oxidase. These are called cytochrome oxidase [...] "blobs" [...] because of their scattered blob-like appearance.|$|R
25|$|The nucleus geniculatus lateralis {{is made up}} of {{different}} cellular strata separated by lamellae, parallel to the surface. The stratae 1 and 2, the most ventral, are magnocellular. The other are mediocellular. From the retina, the axons of the optic nerves go directly to the geniculate nuclei. The nasal component of the optic nerves (the axons issued from the nasal field of the retina of both sides) crosses at the chiasma.The axons of the temporal field do not cross. This is very important in clinical neurology. After the chiasma, axons form the visual tracts turning around the peduncles and arriving into the polar anterior part of the geniculate nucleus. Retinal axons from the controlateral retina end in stratae 1,4 and 6. Those from the ipsilateral retina end in 2,3 and 5. The axons from the lateral geniculate nucleus, through the optic radiation, end in the <b>primary</b> <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> around the calcarine fissure. See visual system.|$|E
25|$|The time {{resolution}} needed depends on brain processing time for various events. An {{example of the}} broad range here is given by the visual processing system. What the eye sees is registered on the photoreceptors of the retina within a millisecond or so. These signals get to the <b>primary</b> <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> via the thalamus in tens of milliseconds. Neuronal activity related to the act of seeing lasts for more than 100ms. A fast reaction, such as swerving to avoid a car crash, takes around 200ms. By about half-a-second, awareness and reflection of the incident sets in. Remembering a similar event may take a few seconds, and emotional or physiological changes such as fear arousal may last minutes or hours. Learned changes, such as recognizing faces or scenes, may last days, months, or years. Most fMRI experiments study brain processes lasting a few seconds, with the study conducted over some tens of minutes. Subjects may move their heads during that time, and this head motion needs to be corrected for. So does drift in the baseline signal over time. Boredom and learning may modify both subject behavior and cognitive processes.|$|E
25|$|The first {{scientific}} studies identifying neurons that responded {{in ways that}} suggested they encode for conditioned stimuli came from work by Mahlon deLong and by R.T. Richardson. They showed that nucleus basalis neurons, which release acetylcholine broadly throughout the cerebral cortex, are activated shortly after a conditioned stimulus, or after a primary reward if no conditioned stimulus exists. These neurons are equally active for positive and negative reinforcers, and {{have been shown to}} be related to neuroplasticity in many cortical regions. Evidence also exists that dopamine is activated at similar times. There is considerable evidence that dopamine participates in both reinforcement and aversive learning. Dopamine pathways project much more densely onto frontal cortex regions. Cholinergic projections, in contrast, are dense even in the posterior cortical regions like the <b>primary</b> <b>visual</b> <b>cortex.</b> A study of patients with Parkinson's disease, a condition attributed to the insufficient action of dopamine, further illustrates the role of dopamine in positive reinforcement. It showed that while off their medication, patients learned more readily with aversive consequences than with positive reinforcement. Patients who were on their medication showed the opposite to be the case, positive reinforcement proving to be the more effective form of learning when dopamine activity is high.|$|E
25|$|Note that {{up until}} now much of the above {{paragraph}} could apply to octopuses, mollusks, worms, insects and things more primitive; anything with a more concentrated nervous system and better eyes than say a jellyfish. However, the following applies to mammals generally and birds (in modified form): The retina in these more complex animals sends fibers (the optic nerve) to the lateral geniculate nucleus, to the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> of the brain. Signals from the retina can also travel directly from the retina to the superior colliculus.|$|R
40|$|Functional {{near-infrared}} spectroscopy (fNIRS) {{allows the}} ability to monitor brain activation by measuring changes in the concentration of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin. Until now no standardized approach for fNIRS data analysis has been established, although {{this has to be}} regarded as a precondition for future application. Hence, we applied the well-established general linear model to optical imaging data. Further, fNIRS data were analyzed in the frequency domain. Two visual tasks were investigated with optical imaging: a checkerboard paradigm supposed to activate the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>visual</b> <b>cortex,</b> and a paradigm consisting of moving colored stimuli (rotating ‘L’s) additionally involving the motion area V 5. Analysis with the general linear model detected the activation focus in the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> during the first paradigm. For the second paradigm, a second laterally localized activated brain region was found, most likely representing V 5. Spatially resolved spectral analysis confirmed the results by showing maxima of power spectral density and coherence in the same respective brain regions. Moreover, it demonstrated a delay of the hemodynamic response in the motion area. In summary, the present study suggests that the general linear model and spatially resolved spectral analysis can be used as standard statistical approaches for optical imaging data, particularly because they are almost independent of the assumed differential path length factors...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the cortical mechanisms of visual-spatial attention while subjects discriminated patterned targets within distractor arrays. Functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) was used to map the boundaries of retinotopic visual areas and to localize attention-related changes in neural activity within several of those areas, including <b>primary</b> <b>visual</b> (striate) <b>cortex.</b> Event-related potentials (ERPs) and modeling of their neural sources, however, indicated that the initial sensory input to striate cortex at 50 − 55 milliseconds after the stimulus was not modulated by attention. The earliest facilitation of attended signals was observed in extrastriate visual areas, at 70 − 75 milliseconds. We hypothesize that the striate cortex modulation found with fMRI may represent a delayed, re-entrant feedback from higher visual areas or a sustained biasing of striate cortical neurons during attention. ERP recordings provide critical temporal information for analyzing the functional neuroanatomy of visual attention...|$|R
25|$|Steady-state {{visually}} evoked potentials (SSVEPs) use potentials {{generated by}} exciting the retina, using visual stimuli modulated at certain frequencies. SSVEP's stimuli are often formed from alternating checkerboard patterns {{and at times}} simply use flashing images. The frequency of the phase reversal of the stimulus used can be clearly distinguished in the spectrum of an EEG; this makes detection of SSVEP stimuli relatively easy. SSVEP {{has proved to be}} successful within many BCI systems. This is due to several factors, the signal elicited is measurable in as large a population as the transient VEP and blink movement and electrocardiographic artefacts do not affect the frequencies monitored. In addition, the SSVEP signal is exceptionally robust; the topographic organization of the <b>primary</b> <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> is such that a broader area obtains afferents from the central or fovial region of the visual field. SSVEP does have several problems however. As SSVEPs use flashing stimuli to infer a user's intent, the user must gaze at one of the flashing or iterating symbols in order to interact with the system. It is, therefore, likely that the symbols could become irritating and uncomfortable to use during longer play sessions, which can often last more than an hour which may not be an ideal gameplay.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{have checked}} the BOLD signal against both signals from {{implanted}} electrodes (mostly in monkeys) and signals of field potentials (that is the electric or magnetic field from the brain's activity, measured outside the skull) from EEG and MEG. The local field potential, which includes both post-neuron-synaptic activity and internal neuron processing, better predicts the BOLD signal. So the BOLD contrast reflects mainly the inputs to a neuron and the neuron's integrative processing within its body, and less the output firing of neurons. In humans, electrodes can be implanted only {{in patients who}} need surgery as treatment, but evidence suggests a similar relationship {{at least for the}} auditory cortex and the <b>primary</b> <b>visual</b> <b>cortex.</b> Activation locations detected by BOLD fMRI in cortical areas (brain surface regions) are known to tally with CBF-based functional maps from PET scans. Some regions just a few millimeters in size, such as the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus, which relays visual inputs from the retina to the visual cortex, have been shown to generate the BOLD signal correctly when presented with visual input. Nearby regions such as the pulvinar nucleus were not stimulated for this task, indicating millimeter resolution for the spatial extent of the BOLD response, at least in thalamic nuclei. In the rat brain, single-whisker touch has been shown to elicit BOLD signals from the somatosensory cortex.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} studies have shown that {{activity}} in primary sensory areas of the brain is not sufficient to produce consciousness: [...] it is possible for subjects to report a lack of awareness even when areas such as the <b>primary</b> <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> show clear electrical responses to a stimulus.

[...] The prefrontal cortex is not the only candidate area, however: [...] studies by Nikos Logothetis and his colleagues have shown, for example, that visually responsive neurons in parts of the temporal lobe reflect the visual perception in the situation when conflicting visual images are presented to different eyes (i.e., bistable percepts during binocular rivalry).|$|E

In many cases direction maps were located within thick stripes and exhibited pinwheel or linear organizations.

2500|$|Mapping of the {{occipital}} cortex has {{possible use}} {{in the development of}} a prosthesis for the blind. Electrical stimulation in the occipital lobe has been found to cause visual illusions called phosphenes such as light, colors, or shadows, which were observed in the early experiments of Penfield and Jasper [...] The first recorded production of artificial sight was in experiments done by Brindley and Dobelle, where they were able to allow blind patients to 'see' small characters through cortical stimulation. Electrical stimulation in the occipital lobe has also been known to produce small colored circles usually in the center of the patient's field of vision. Visual hallucinations, such as moving geometric patterns and moving colored phosphenes have also been observed with cortical stimulation. [...] Electrodes at the occipital cortex surface tend to produce flickering phosphenes, while electrodes inserted deeper within the cortex produce steady colors. [...] The <b>primary</b> <b>visual</b> <b>cortex,</b> which is responsible for generating more complex images, is located deeper within the calcarine fissure of the occipital lobe, so intracortical stimulation is needed to stimulate these areas effectively. Intracortical stimulation uses an electrode that goes deeper into the brain to more effectively stimulate the <b>primary</b> <b>visual</b> <b>cortex,</b> as opposed to trying to work only from the surface of the brain, which can cause unintended visual signals, pain, and damage to the nervous tissue.|$|E
