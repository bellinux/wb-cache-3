5|$|Ricordi {{sent his}} agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to {{negotiate}} with Sardou, who <b>preferred</b> <b>that</b> his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers {{were interested in the}} piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 1780s, a {{large number}} of {{prominent}} Americans called {{for the establishment of a}} central mint to supply the United States with official coinage; all such proposals failed due in large part to lack of funds and opposition from individuals and groups who <b>preferred</b> <b>that</b> coins be struck by the individual states. Since there were no federal coins issued, the needs of the states were fulfilled by a variety of domestic and foreign coins and tokens, including Spanish eight-real coins (popularly known as Spanish dollars or pieces of eight).|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is <b>preferred</b> <b>that</b> benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E
5|$|Gens had {{a dispute}} with a tailor named Weisskopf, who ran a {{tailoring}} workshop in the ghetto. Weisskopf tried to increase his own power base by negotiating directly with the German Army and not going through the ghetto's Labor Department. When Gens ordered all work contracts {{to go through the}} Labor Department, Weisskopf appealed to his German contacts, but the Gebeitskommissar of Vilnius, Hans Hingst, <b>preferred</b> <b>that</b> control of such contracts go through his own office which worked through the ghetto's administration. Hingst thus ruled in Gens' favor. The ghetto police then searched Weisskopf's house, found contraband, arrested him, and jailed him for four days, after which he lost his position running the workshop.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Paterson and Cauty held several {{recording}} {{sessions at}} Cauty's studio, Trancentral. When offered an album deal by Big Life, the Orb found themselves at a crossroads: Cauty <b>preferred</b> <b>that</b> the Orb release their music through his KLF Communications label, whereas Paterson wanted {{to ensure that}} the group did not become a side-project of the KLF. Because of these issues, Cauty and Paterson split in April 1990, with Paterson keeping the name the Orb. As a result of the break-up, Cauty removed Paterson's contributions from the in-progress recordings and released the album as Space on KLF Communications. Also out of these sessions came the KLF album Chill Out, on which Paterson appeared in an uncredited role.|$|E

5|$|In June 2008, Bolt {{responded to}} {{claims that he}} was a lazy athlete, saying that the {{comments}} were unjustified, and he trained hard to achieve his potential. However, he surmised that such comments stemmed from his lack of enthusiasm for the 400 metres event, and chose to not make the effort to train for distance running. Turning his efforts to the 200 m, Bolt proved that he could excel in multiple events—first setting the world-leading time in Ostrava, then breaking the national record for the second time with a 19.67 s finish in Athens, Greece. Although Mills still <b>preferred</b> <b>that</b> Bolt focus on the longer distances, the acceptance of Bolt's demand to run in the 100 m worked for both sprinter and trainer. Bolt was more focused in practice, and a training schedule to boost his top speed and his stamina, in preparation for the Olympics, had improved both his 100 m and 200 m times.|$|E
5|$|The {{open and}} idealistic ethos did not last. The History Division's {{immediate}} supervisors, Joseph Anderson and G. Homer Durham, failed {{to defend the}} division. Spies within the department, under the instruction of Mark E. Peterson, compiled what they believed to be heretical statements and passed them along to the Twelve Apostles and ultimately the offender's bishop (local ecclesiastical authority). In {{a meeting with the}} first presidency in 1973, LDS Church President Harold B. Lee rejected proposals for a student research award and for a Friends of the Church History organization. Lee <b>preferred</b> <b>that</b> researchers clear sensitive archive research topics like polygamy with the first presidency ahead of time. Staff historian D. Michael Quinn published an article in the LDS Church magazine, the Ensign, exploring the origins of the office of presiding bishop, and asserted that Edward Partridge was not the first incumbent. Although Quinn's research was correct, space in the Ensign did not permit a complete documentation of Quinn's research, and some readers felt the article insulted Partridge's memory. Apostle Spencer W. Kimball suggested that Arrington submit an apology to readers; Arrington sent a message to the publisher with his regrets that the article's format was unfortunate.|$|E
5|$|Around 12:00, the Italians {{went over}} to the offensive, with the 3rd Alpine Group tasked to advance to the line Selca–Radovljica, XI Corps to push via Logatec to Ljubljana, VI Corps to drive on Prezid, and V Corps to advance from Fiume towards Kraljevica then Lokve. While one Italian attack south of the Snežnik plateau was stopped by {{elements}} of the Mountain Detachment Rišnajaski and the Italian advance was held up by border troops in some areas, there was little significant resistance, {{and by the end of}} the day they had captured Sušak, Bakar, Delnice, Jesenice, Vrhnika, Logatec and Ljubljana. To assist the Italian advance, the Luftwaffe attacked Yugoslav troops in the Ljubljana region, and the 14th Panzer Division, which had captured Zagreb on 10 April, drove west to encircle the withdrawing 7th Army. The Italians faced little resistance, and captured about 30,000 troops of the 7th Army waiting to surrender near Delnice. When the Italian 14th Infantry Division Isonzo entered Ljubljana, a delegate of the NszS greeted its commander, Generale di Divisione Federico Romero, and symbolically handed him the keys to the city. An official reception was held for Romero that evening, attended by Natlačen and most of the members of the NszS, but because Natlačen and the council <b>preferred</b> <b>that</b> the Germans occupy Ljubljana, he asked Romero for permission to travel to Celje the following day to meet with Lanz.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT), Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PTC), and West Virginia Division of Highways (WVDOH) {{had planned}} on {{submitting}} an {{application to the}} American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) on realigning US 119 onto the Mon–Fayette Expressway south of Uniontown {{all the way to}} the Mon–Fayette's southern terminus with Interstate 68 near Cheat Lake, West Virginia east of Morgantown, where it would briefly run concurrent with I-68 once the West Virginia section of the Mon–Fayette Expressway opened in 2011. As to where US 119 would leave I-68 was a matter of debate, however, as PennDOT and the PTC <b>preferred</b> <b>that</b> US 119 exits I-68 at Exit 1, completely bypassing Downtown Morgantown, while WVDOH <b>preferred</b> <b>that</b> US 119 exited I-68 sooner at Exit 7 so that US 119 would at least continue to run through Downtown Morgantown. (Both exits are to US 119's existing alignment in the area.) As of February 2014, there has been no response back on the AASHTO, and US 119 remains on its current alignment south of Uniontown.|$|E
