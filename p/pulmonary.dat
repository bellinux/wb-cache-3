5|$|A <b>pulmonary</b> {{embolism}} is a {{blood clot}} that becomes lodged in the <b>pulmonary</b> arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs. <b>Pulmonary</b> emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer. <b>Pulmonary</b> hypertension describes an increased pressure {{at the beginning of}} the <b>pulmonary</b> artery that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pulmonary</b> stenosis: Narrowing of the <b>pulmonary</b> artery as it {{exits the}} heart. Other cardiac {{abnormalities}} may be present, including aortic stenosis, or mitral valve prolapse.|$|E
5|$|Hereditary {{recurrent}} pneumothorax or <b>pulmonary</b> cysts {{are associated}} with Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, and cystic fibrosis. Non-hereditary recurrent pneumothorax and/or <b>pulmonary</b> cysts can occur with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. These conditions are differentiated from Birt–Hogg–Dubé through examining the patient history and performing a physical examination. In women suspected to have the disease, ruling out <b>pulmonary</b> or thoracic endometriosis may be necessary.|$|E
5|$|Low oxygen levels lead to hypoxic <b>pulmonary</b> vasoconstriction, the {{tightening}} of small {{blood vessels in}} the lung to create an optimal distribution of blood through the lung. Persistently low oxygen levels causing chronic vasoconstriction leads to increased pressure on the <b>pulmonary</b> artery (<b>pulmonary</b> hypertension), which in turn puts strain on the right ventricle, the part of the heart that pumps blood to the lungs. The right ventricle undergoes remodeling, becomes distended and is less able to remove blood from the veins. When this is the case, raised hydrostatic pressure leads to accumulation of fluid in the skin (edema), and in more severe cases the liver and the abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|Other {{characteristics}} {{seen with}} the syndrome include developmental delay, growth retardation, <b>pulmonary</b> stenosis (an obstruction of blood-flow from the right ventricle of the heart to the <b>pulmonary</b> artery) with associated dyspnea (shortness of breath), and renal agenesis (failure of the kidneys to develop during the fetal period). Undescended testes, hyperactivity and aggressive behavior have also been noted.|$|E
5|$|People with TBI are {{provided}} with supplemental oxygen and may need mechanical ventilation. Employment of certain measures such as Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and ventilation at higher-than-normal pressures may be helpful in maintaining adequate oxygenation. However, such measures can also increase leakage of air through a tear, and can stress the sutures in a tear that has been surgically repaired; therefore the lowest possible airway pressures that still maintain oxygenation are typically used. Mechanical ventilation can also cause <b>pulmonary</b> barotrauma when high pressure is required to ventilate the lungs. Techniques such as <b>pulmonary</b> toilet (removal of secretions), fluid management, and treatment of pneumonia are employed to improve <b>pulmonary</b> compliance (the elasticity of the lungs).|$|E
5|$|<b>Pulmonary</b> oxygen {{toxicity}} is {{an entirely}} avoidable event while diving. The limited duration and naturally intermittent nature of most diving makes this a relatively rare (and even then, reversible) complication for divers. Established guidelines enable divers to calculate when they {{are at risk of}} <b>pulmonary</b> toxicity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pulmonary,</b> or pulmonic {{stenosis}} is {{an often}} congenital narrowing of the <b>pulmonary</b> valve; {{it can be}} present in nasodigitoacoustic-affected infants. Treatment of this cardiac abnormality can require surgery, or non-surgical procedures like balloon valvuloplasty (widening the valve with a balloon catheter).|$|E
5|$|The major {{function}} of the lungs is gas exchange between the lungs and the blood. The alveolar and <b>pulmonary</b> capillary gases equilibrate across the blood–air barrier, a very thin diffusion membrane which is only, on average, about 2μm thick, consisting of {{the walls of the}} <b>pulmonary</b> alveoli, consisting of the alveolar epithelial cells, their basement membranes and the endothelial cells of the <b>pulmonary</b> capillaries. This membrane is folded into about 300 million small air sacs called alveoli (each between 75 and 300µm in diameter) branching off from the bronchioles in the lungs, thus providing an extremely large surface area (estimates varying between 70 and 145m2) for gas exchange to occur.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis may infect {{any part}} of the body, but most {{commonly}} occurs in the lungs (known as <b>pulmonary</b> tuberculosis). Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with <b>pulmonary</b> TB.|$|E
5|$|Water-soluble {{compounds}} of yttrium {{are considered}} mildly toxic, while its insoluble compounds are non-toxic. In experiments on animals, yttrium {{and its compounds}} caused lung and liver damage, though toxicity varies with different yttrium compounds. In rats, inhalation of yttrium citrate caused <b>pulmonary</b> edema and dyspnea, while inhalation of yttrium chloride caused liver edema, pleural effusions, and <b>pulmonary</b> hyperemia.|$|E
5|$|When the {{atrioventricular}} valves (tricuspid and mitral) are open, during {{blood flow}} to the ventricles, the aortic and <b>pulmonary</b> valves are closed to prevent backflow into the ventricles. When the ventricular pressure is greater than the atrial pressure the tricuspid and mitral valves will shut. When the ventricles contract the pressure forces the aortic and <b>pulmonary</b> valves open. As the ventricles relax, the aortic and <b>pulmonary</b> valves will close in response to decreased pressure.|$|E
25|$|Co-administration of {{pentoxifylline}} and thiopental causes {{death by}} acute <b>pulmonary</b> edema in rats. This <b>pulmonary</b> edema was not mediated by cardiac failure or by <b>pulmonary</b> hypertension but {{was due to}} increased <b>pulmonary</b> vascular permeability.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{management}} of acute <b>pulmonary</b> embolism (<b>pulmonary</b> thrombectomy) is uncommon and {{has largely been}} abandoned because of poor long-term outcomes. However, recently, it {{has gone through a}} resurgence with the revision of the surgical technique and is thought to benefit certain people. Chronic <b>pulmonary</b> embolism leading to <b>pulmonary</b> hypertension (known as chronic thromboembolic hypertension) is treated with a surgical procedure known as a <b>pulmonary</b> thromboendarterectomy.|$|E
25|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} theory is that high transmural pressures lead to <b>pulmonary</b> capillary stress failure. There may be contributions from the bronchial circulation. <b>Pulmonary</b> capillary transmural pressure is determined by <b>pulmonary</b> capillary pressure and airway pressure. The horse has very high <b>pulmonary</b> vascular pressures during intense exercise, exceeding 100 mmHg in the <b>pulmonary</b> artery during intense exercise. During expiration the high positive pressures in the <b>pulmonary</b> blood vessels pushing out are opposed by high positive airway pressures pushing back and this does not place undue stress on the thin blood vessel walls. During inspiration, the high positive pressures in the <b>pulmonary</b> blood vessels pushing out are met by negative pressures distending the blood vessel and placing increased stress on the walls.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>pulmonary</b> {{complications}} in {{more advanced}} disease include aspiration pneumonia, <b>pulmonary</b> hemorrhage and pneumothorax.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pulmonary</b> hypertension* is high {{pressure}} in the <b>pulmonary</b> artery. In dogs it {{can be caused by}} heartworm disease, <b>pulmonary</b> thromboembolism, or chronic hypoxemia (low oxygen). It can result in right-sided heart disease (cor pulmonale). Signs include difficulty breathing, cyanosis, and exercise intolerance.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation of the pleurae {{known as}} {{pleurisy}} can rarely {{give rise to}} shrinking lung syndrome. SLE can cause pleuritic pain and also give rise to shrinking lung syndrome, involving a reduced lung volume. Other associated lung conditions include pneumonitis, chronic diffuse interstitial lung disease, <b>pulmonary</b> hypertension, <b>pulmonary</b> emboli, and <b>pulmonary</b> hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|A healing {{laceration}} may {{resemble a}} <b>pulmonary</b> nodule on radiographs, but unlike <b>pulmonary</b> nodules, lacerations decrease in size over time on radiographs.|$|E
25|$|The most {{specific}} test of <b>pulmonary</b> toxicity due to amiodarone is {{a dramatically}} decreased DLCO noted on <b>pulmonary</b> function testing.|$|E
25|$|Oxazepam is {{contraindicated}} in myasthenia gravis, chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> disease, {{and limited}} <b>pulmonary</b> reserve, {{as well as}} severe hepatic disease.|$|E
25|$|Seizures {{may result}} from either opioid or local {{anesthetic}} effects. <b>Pulmonary</b> edema {{may result from}} direct <b>pulmonary</b> toxicity, neurogenic/anoxic effects, or cardiovascular depression.|$|E
25|$|CT <b>pulmonary</b> {{angiography}} (CTPA) is a <b>pulmonary</b> angiogram obtained using {{computed tomography}} (CT) with radiocontrast rather than right heart catheterization. Its advantages are clinical equivalence, its non-invasive nature, its greater availability to people, {{and the possibility}} of identifying other lung disorders from the differential diagnosis in case there is no <b>pulmonary</b> embolism.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{there are}} no {{clinically}} approved agents that can reduce <b>pulmonary</b> and airway cell dropout and avert the transition to <b>pulmonary</b> and /or airway fibrosis.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{in vitro}} show that {{significant}} {{disruption of the}} <b>pulmonary</b> capillaries occurs at pressures of approximately 80 mmHg. In vivo, significant EIPH occurs above a mean <b>pulmonary</b> artery pressure of around 80–95 mmHg. On {{the basis of this}} theory, any factor or disease that would increase <b>pulmonary</b> vascular pressures (e.g. hypervolaemia) or increase the magnitude of the negative pressures in the lung during inspiration (e.g. dynamic upper airway obstruction) would increase the severity of EIPH; however neither experimentally induced laryngeal hemiplegia nor dorsal displacement of the soft palate increase <b>pulmonary</b> capillary transmural pressure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pulmonary</b> edema and <b>pulmonary</b> {{infections are}} {{commonly}} seen {{in patients with}} ALF. Mechanical ventilation may be required. However, positive end-expiratory pressure can worsen cerebral edema.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pulmonary</b> {{hypertension}} (increased {{pressure on}} the <b>pulmonary</b> artery) can lead to strain on the right ventricle and a risk of heart failure; typical symptoms are shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance, and episodes of syncope. 21% of children and 30% of adults have evidence of <b>pulmonary</b> hypertension when tested; this is associated with reduced walking distance and increased mortality.|$|E
25|$|Increased blood {{pressure}} in the capillaries of the lung causes <b>pulmonary</b> hypertension, leading to interstitial edema if the pressure increases to above 20mmHg, and to <b>pulmonary</b> edema at pressures above 25mmHg.|$|E
25|$|A {{chest x-ray}} {{is useful to}} confirm or rule out a pneumothorax, <b>pulmonary</b> edema, or pneumonia. Spiral {{computed}} tomography with intravenous radiocontrast is the imaging study of choice to evaluate for <b>pulmonary</b> embolism.|$|E
25|$|The {{prostaglandin}} iloprost is used {{to manage}} critical ischemia and <b>pulmonary</b> hypertension in RP, and the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan {{is used to}} manage severe <b>pulmonary</b> hypertension and prevent finger ulcers in scleroderma.|$|E
25|$|Lung {{involvement}} is typically {{in the form}} of hemoptysis, pleuritis, cough, or fever, and in severe cases can be life-threatening if the outlet <b>pulmonary</b> artery develops an aneurysm which ruptures causing severe vascular collapse and death from bleeding in the lungs. Nodules, consolidations, cavities and ground glass lesions are common in patients with <b>pulmonary</b> involvement. <b>Pulmonary</b> artery thrombosis may occur.|$|E
25|$|The chest X-ray in {{individuals}} with chronic MI {{is characterized by}} enlargement of the left atrium and the left ventricle. The <b>pulmonary</b> vascular markings are typically normal, since <b>pulmonary</b> venous pressures are usually not significantly elevated.|$|E
25|$|Nitric oxide/oxygen blends {{are used}} in {{critical}} care to promote capillary and <b>pulmonary</b> dilation to treat primary <b>pulmonary</b> hypertension in neonatal patients and post-meconium aspiration related to birth defects. These are often a last-resort gas mixture before the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Nitric oxide therapy {{has the potential to}} significantly increase the quality of life and, in some cases, save the lives of infants at risk for <b>pulmonary</b> vascular disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pulmonary</b> Barotrauma Cases.|$|E
25|$|The {{circulatory system}} of the lungs is {{the portion of the}} {{cardiovascular}} system in which oxygen-depleted blood is pumped away from the heart, via the <b>pulmonary</b> artery, to the lungs and returned, oxygenated, to the heart via the <b>pulmonary</b> vein.|$|E
25|$|Chronic <b>pulmonary</b> {{reactions}} {{caused by}} nitrofurantoin include diffuse interstitial pneumonitis, <b>pulmonary</b> fibrosis, or both. This uncommon reaction may occur 1 month to 6 years after starting {{the drug and}} is usually related to its total lifetime dose. This reaction manifests with progressive shortness of breath. It {{is important to recognize}} nitrofurantoin as possible cause of symptoms and discontinue the drug when the suspicion of <b>pulmonary</b> side effects arises as it can be reversible if the drug is stopped early.|$|E
