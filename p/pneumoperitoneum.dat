An X-ray may reveal this. Pleural effusion, in which there is fluid abnormally present between the two pleurae of the lungs, is detected by an X-ray of the chest, showing fluid collecting in the angle between the ribs and diaphragm. An X-ray may also be used to reveal a <b>pneumoperitoneum,</b> in which there is gas in the abdomen.|$|E

People injured in motor vehicle collisions may present with a [...] "seat belt sign," [...] bruising on the abdomen along {{the site of the}} lap portion of the safety belt; this sign is associated with a high rate of injury to the abdominal organs. Seatbelts may also cause abrasions and hematomas; up to 30 percent of people with such signs have associated internal injuries. Early indications of abdominal trauma include nausea, vomiting, blood in the urine, and fever. [...] The injury may present with abdominal pain, tenderness, distension, or rigidity to the touch, and bowel sounds may be diminished or absent. Abdominal guarding is a tensing of the abdominal wall muscles to guard inflamed organs within the abdomen. <b>Pneumoperitoneum,</b> air or gas in the abdominal cavity, may be an indication of rupture of a hollow organ. In penetrating injuries, an evisceration (protrusion of internal organs out of a wound) may be present.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Pneumoperitoneum</b> is [...] (abnormal {{presence}} of air or other gas) in the peritoneal cavity, a potential space within the abdominal cavity. The {{most common cause}} is a perforated abdominal viscus, generally a perforated peptic ulcer, although {{any part of the}} bowel may perforate from a benign ulcer, tumor or abdominal trauma.

5000|$|In the mid-twentieth century, an [...] "artificial" [...] <b>pneumoperitoneum</b> was {{sometimes}} intentionally administered {{as a treatment}} for a hiatal hernia. This was achieved by insufflating the abdomen with carbon dioxide. The practice is currently used by surgical teams in order to perform laparoscopic surgery.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Chest X-ray of {{the same}} patient as the picture above. A small {{crescent}} of air can be seen under the right part of the diaphragm, caused by Chilaiditi's sign. However, it could easily be mistaken for free intra-abdominal air (<b>pneumoperitoneum)</b> which could mistakenly be attributed to bowel perforation.|$|E
50|$|Normally {{this causes}} no symptoms, {{and this is}} called Chilaiditi's sign. The sign can be {{permanently}} present, or sporadically. This anatomical variant is sometimes mistaken for the more serious condition of having air under the diaphragm (<b>pneumoperitoneum)</b> which is usually an indication of bowel perforation, possibly leading to surgical interventions.|$|E
50|$|Pneumomediastinum is the {{presence}} of air in the mediastinum, which in some cases can lead to pneumothorax, <b>pneumoperitoneum,</b> and pneumopericardium if left untreated. However, that does not always occur and sometimes those conditions are actually the cause, not the result, of pneumomediastinum. These conditions frequently accompany Boerhaave's syndrome, or spontaneous esophageal rupture.|$|E
50|$|The {{football}} sign is {{when the}} abdomen appears as a large oval radiolucency reminiscent of an American football on a supine projectional radiograph. The football sign is most frequently seen in infants with spontaneous or iatrogenic gastric perforation causing <b>pneumoperitoneum.</b> It is also seen in bowel obstruction with secondary perforation, as in Hirschprung disease, midgut volvulus, meconium ileus and intestinal atresia. Iatrogenic causes like endoscopic perforation may also give football sign.|$|E
5000|$|Kelling {{specialized}} in gastrointestinal physiology and anatomy. He {{is credited with}} performing the first laparoscopic examination, a procedure he referred to as [...] "celioscopy". In 1901 he performed the procedure on the abdomen of a dog using a Nitze-cystoscope. Prior to cystoscopic viewing of the abdomen, Kelling insufflated it with filtered air via a device known as a trocar. Insufflation was {{used to create a}} <b>pneumoperitoneum</b> in order to prevent intra-abdominal bleeding.|$|E
50|$|Open {{cholecystectomy}} is occasionally {{performed in}} certain circumstances, such as failure of laparoscopic surgery, severe systemic illness causing intolerance of <b>pneumoperitoneum,</b> or {{as part of}} a liver transplant. In open cholecystectomy, a surgical incision of approximately 10 to 15 cm is typically made below the edge of the right ribcage. The liver is retracted superiorly, and a top-down approach is taken (from the fundus towards the neck) to remove the gallbladder from the liver, typically using electrocautery.|$|E

An X-ray may also be used to reveal a <b>pneumoperitoneum,</b> in which there is gas in the abdomen.|$|E
50|$|Appendectomy may be {{performed}} laparoscopically (in minimally invasive surgery) {{or as an}} open operation. Laparoscopy is often used if the diagnosis is in doubt, {{or if it is}} desirable to hide the scars in the umbilicus or in the pubic hair line. Recovery may be a little quicker with laparoscopic surgery; the procedure is more expensive and resource-intensive than open surgery and generally takes a little longer, with the (low in most patients) additional risks associated with <b>pneumoperitoneum</b> (inflating the abdomen with gas). Advanced pelvic sepsis occasionally requires a lower midline laparotomy.|$|E
50|$|Modern needles are 12 to 15 cm long, with an {{external}} diameter of 2 mm. The outer cannula {{consists of a}} beveled needle point for cutting through tissues of the abdominal wall. A spring-loaded, inner stylet is positioned within the outer cannula. This inner stylet has a dull tip to protect any viscera from injury by the sharp, outer cannula. Direct pressure on the tip—as when penetrating through tissue—pushes the dull stylet into the shaft of the outer cannula. When {{the tip of the}} needle enters a space such as the peritoneal cavity, the dull, inner stylet springs forward. Carbon dioxide is then passed through the Veress needle to inflate the space, creating a <b>pneumoperitoneum.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1964 Ursov {{wrote his}} thesis for Candidate of Medical Sciences degree, {{entitled}} [...] "Repeated x-ray screenings in Klin city and Klin territory of Moscow Region". In 1973 he obtained the Doctor of Medical Science, writing his thesis on the [...] "organizational and epidemiological bases of the tuberculosis elimination.": {{he became a}} professor in 1978. In 1986, he was selected as a Corresponding Member of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences. At the academy, he worked on many projects, such as {{the study of the}} relationship of tuberculosis in humans and farm animals in Siberia, the use of intravenous bactericidal anti-tuberculosis therapy, and the use of artificial pneumothorax and <b>pneumoperitoneum</b> to cure tuberculosis.|$|E
50|$|A {{diagnosis}} of peritonitis is {{based primarily on}} the clinical manifestations described above. Rigidity (involuntary contraction of the abdominal muscles) is the most specific exam finding for diagnosing peritonitis (+ likelihood ratio: 3.9). If peritonitis is strongly suspected, then surgery is performed without further delay for other investigations. Leukocytosis, hypokalemia, hypernatremia, and acidosis may be present, {{but they are not}} specific findings. Abdominal X-rays may reveal dilated, edematous intestines, although such X-rays are mainly useful to look for <b>pneumoperitoneum,</b> an indicator of gastrointestinal perforation. The role of whole-abdomen ultrasound examination is under study and is likely to expand in the future. Computed tomography (CT or CAT scanning) may be useful in differentiating causes of abdominal pain. If reasonable doubt still persists, an exploratory peritoneal lavage or laparoscopy may be performed. In patients with ascites, a {{diagnosis of}} peritonitis is made via paracentesis (abdominal tap): More than 250 polymorphonucleate cells per μL is considered diagnostic. In addition, Gram stain is almost always negative, whereas culture of the peritoneal fluid can determine the microorganism responsible and determine their sensitivity to antimicrobial agents.|$|E

5000|$|Palmer {{was born}} in Paris. His parents, Fritjof Palmer and Signe, née Garling, were from Gothenburg, Sweden. Palmer was trained as a {{gynecologist}} and became {{the head of the}} gynecological research at the Faculty of Medicine in Paris in 1934. His experiments with intraabdominal endoscopy started during World War II in Paris, and in his work he was supported by his wife Elisabeth. Using initially a cystoscope he observed the female genital organs via the transabdominal and transvaginal approach and realized that the former required a controlled <b>pneumoperitoneum</b> during the procedure. He developed instruments for his procedures and established safe criteria for insufflation using CO2 in lieu of oxygen via the Veress needle. Use of the Trendelenburg position and mobilizing the uterus by a transvaginal cannula were introduced by Palmer. [...] In his first report he described his experience with 250 “coelioscopies gynecologiques” using both the transabdominal and the transvaginal approach. Palmer noted the advantages of the transabdominal approach. In 1949, he described the Regular rhythmic contractions of uterus felt as early as 6-8 weeks, now known as the [...] "Palmer's Sign". Procedures were performed at Hospital Broca first under local anesthesia; in 1952 Palmer switched to general anesthesia. New illumination techniques using quartz rods became available in 1952 greatly improving the laparoscopic image. In 1961 Palmer was the first to retrieve a human oocyte form a patient via laparoscopy. In 1962 Palmer performed laparoscopic tubal coagulations and other interventions.|$|E
