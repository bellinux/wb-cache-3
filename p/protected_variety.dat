60|$|Nor is this so {{difficult}} {{a bit of}} evolution as it looks at first sight. Almost all plants {{are more or less}} covered with hairs, and it needs but a slight thickening at the base, a slight woody deposit at the point, to turn them forthwith into the stout prickles of the rose or the bramble. Most leaves are more or less pointed at the end or at the summits of the lobes; and it needs but a slight intensification of this pointed tendency to produce forthwith the sharp defensive foliage of gorse, thistles, and holly. Often one can see all the intermediate stages still surviving under one's very eyes. The thistles, themselves, for example, vary from soft and unarmed species which haunt out-of-the-way spots beyond the reach of browsing herbivores, to such trebly-mailed types as that enemy of the agricultural interest, the creeping thistle, in which the leaves continue themselves as prickly wings down every side of the stem, so that the whole plant is amply clad from head to foot in a defensive coat of fierce and bristling spearheads. There is a common little English meadow weed, the rest-harrow, which in rich and uncropped fields produces no defensive armour of any sort; but on the much-browsed-over suburban commons and in similar exposed spots, where only gorse and blackthorn stand a chance for their lives against the cows and donkeys, it has developed a <b>protected</b> <b>variety</b> in which some of the branches grow abortive, and end abruptly in stout spines like a hawthorn's. Only those rest-harrows have there survived in the sharp struggle for existence which happened most to baffle their relentless pursuers.|$|E

5000|$|The Convention was revised in Geneva in 1972, 1978 and 1991.

Under that provision, for example, a flower breeder who protects their variety in the Netherlands could block importation of cut flowers of that variety into the Netherlands from Egypt, which does not grant plant breeders' rights, because the breeder had no opportunity to exercise any rights in Egypt.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{changing}} survival patterns of cereal crop variety innovations in the UK since {{the introduction of}} plant breeders’ rights in the mid- 1960 s. Using non-parametric, semi-parametric and parametric approaches, we examine the determinants of the survival of wheat variety innovations, focusing on the impacts of changes to Plant Variety Protection (PVP) regime {{over the last four}} decades. We find that the period since the introduction of the PVP regime has been characterised by the accelerated development of new varieties and increased private sector participation in the breeding of cereal crop varieties. However, the increased flow of varieties has been accompanied by a sharp decline in the longevity of innovations. These trends may have contributed to a reduction in the returns appropriated by plant breeders from <b>protected</b> <b>variety</b> innovations and may explain the decline of conventional plant breeding in the UK. It may also explain the persistent demand from the seed industry for stronger protection. The strengthening of the PVP regime in conformity with the UPOV Convention of 1991, the introduction of EU-wide protection through the Community Plant Variety Office and the introduction of royalties on farm-saved seed have had a positive effect on the longevity of <b>protected</b> <b>variety</b> innovations, but have not been adequate to offset the long term decline in survival durations...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} genetic {{conformity}} {{lies at the}} basis of the definition of essential derivation, or the process of using a <b>protected</b> <b>variety</b> (or 'initial variety', IV) as the base to develop another similar variety (the essentially derived variety, EDV). Methods based on morphology, biochemistry or on molecular markers can be used to estimate genetic conformity. In this study, the capability of AFLP(R) (1) markers to provide a reliable and meaningful estimate of genetic conformity of different varieties was investigated in diploid perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne spp.), an allogamous species whose varieties are genetically heterogeneous. Twelve accessions with known breeding lineage, comprising five closely related groups, were included in the study. For the set of test accessions analysed, the AFLP protocol accurately reproduced the same relationships as were evident from examining their morphology and both these results were consistent with the relationships known to exist within the different test groups. Principal components analysis as well as cluster analysis associated unambiguously the IV and the EDV accessions. It was concluded that the methodology developed in this study {{could be used as a}} model from which to create a protocol for evaluating putative cases of essential derivation...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{essential}} derivation {{was introduced by}} UPOV in 1991 to refine the scope of breeders' rights. The intention of the essential derivation concept was to confer breeders protection against fraudulent practices in which `new¿ varieties are produced from current, protected ones without a genuine breeding effort. A new variety that has passed the standard UPOV tests for Distinctness, Stability and Uniformity, and therefore is eligible for receiving breeders' rights, can still largely {{be the same as}} a currently <b>protected</b> <b>variety</b> for a conglomerate of `essential¿, phenotypic traits. Practical implementations of the essential derivation concept entail the definition of a threshold value for genetic conformity between initial and new, putatively derived varieties, beyond which the breeder of the new variety may be asked to prove the genuine nature of his breeding effort. An attractive option for the definition of threshold values for genetic conformity consists in the use of similarities calculated from molecular marker characterizations of varieties. The use of marker based similarities in essential derivation cases raises a number of predominantly statistical questions, such as how to define a reference population of varieties within which potential essential derivation disputes could occur, how many marker loci to use for a required precision, and how to define a threshold value {{on the basis of the}} observed distribution of similarity values.

40|$|To get the {{protection}} for essentially derived variety, the initial variety {{must be a}} protected first, because the dependence can onlyexist in relation to <b>protected</b> <b>variety.</b> While determining whether a variety is EDV or not, {{it is to be}} noted that, an EDV can bedirectly derived from the initial variety or from any variety that itself is predominantly derived from the initial variety. Hencethere can be "cascade" of derivations. In determining the cascade of derivation, {{it should be noted that}} each EDV shall only bedependent on one, the protected initial variety; a cascade of dependence shall not exist. This principle of dependence has beenintroduced to better protect the breeder of the initial variety and not those having made just derivations. More recently, based onthe general opinion of its members, ISF moved to the definition of only one threshold that would divide the scale of conformityinto two parts: below the threshold there would be no presumption of essential derivation, above the threshold there would bepresumption of essential derivation and the burden of proof of non predominant derivation would fall on the breeder of theputative essentially derived variety. The threshold will certainly vary from species to species, depending on the existing geneticvariability within the species and the established breeding procedures. To eliminate the ‘copycat breeding’ or ‘cosmetic breeding’,the concept of ‘essential derivation’ was included in the revised UPOV convention Act (UPOV, 1991).

40|$|The {{institution}} of “agricultural exception” involves the legally permitted possibility of departing from the accepted system of protecting plant varieties {{in order to}} secure the interest of farmers.

However, agricultural exception has a number of properties that make it differ from statutory licences related to industrial property or copyright. The following features make agricultural exception differ from other statutory licences: the specific fundamental nature of the public interest that agricultural exception contributes to (securing the food security of a country), the specific manner of shaping of a limited group of entities the privilege is intended for, resulting from the application of this institution of law (it relates exclusively to farmers), the specific rules related to the direct payment of fees by the entities benefiting from the rule of agricultural exception: the fees are paid directly to the cultivators who are authorised to receive them under their exclusive right to the respective varieties.
