Tony Roark describes Aristotle's view of time as follows:Aristotle defines time as [...] "a number of motion {{with respect to the}} before and after" [...] (Phys. 219b1-2), by which he intends to denote motion’s susceptibility to division into undetached parts of arbitrary length, a property that it possesses both by virtue of its intrinsic nature and also by virtue of the capacities and activities of percipient souls. Motion is intrinsically indeterminate, but perceptually determinable, with respect to its length.

40|$|Presented at the 2012 Global Space Exploration Conference, 22 - 24 May 2012, Washington DC, USA. Slow-changing {{characteristics}} of controlled environmental {{systems and the}} increasing availability of data from sensors and measurements o er opportunities {{for the development of}} computational methods that enhance situation observability, decrease human workload, and support real-time decision making. Some of these methods are known as multi-sensor data fusion; they combine measurements from multiple sources to produce a more concise representation of the information contained therein. Such information can be used to design better user-centered interfaces, allowing human operators to maintain situation awareness. Situation observability enables humans to perceive and comprehend the state the system at a given instant of time, and helps human operators in deciding what actions to take at any given time that may a ect the projection of such state into the near future. This paper presents a multi-sensor data fusion method that makes use of a collection of discrete human-inputs and measurements to generate a granular <b>perception</b> <b>function</b> that supports situation awareness. These human-inputs are situation- rich, meaning that they combine measurements defining the operational condition of the system with a subjective assessment of its situation. As a result, the <b>perception</b> <b>function</b> produces situation-rich signals that may be used in ecological human-interfaces or as a switching mechanism in automation strategies and fail-safe/fail-op mechanisms. The granular <b>perception</b> <b>function</b> is a fuzzy associative memory composed of a number of granules equal to the number situations that may be detected by human observers; its development is based in the interaction of human operators with the system. The human-input data sets are transformed into a fuzzy associative memory by an adaptive method based on particle swarms. The paper describes the multi-sensor data fusion method proposed and its application to a ground-based aquatic habitat working as a small-scale environmental system. Results show how this approach helps to generate signals that enhance the situation observability of the aquatic habitat...|$|E

Previously 1, 2 we presented the choice of suitable contrast metrics, apparatus and laboratory set-up, the stimuli acquisition and manipulation, the methodology employed in the subjective tests and initial findings. Here we present our experimental paradigm, the measurement and modeling of the following visual response functions: i) Isolated Contrast Sensitivity Function (iCSF); Contextual Contrast Sensitivity Function (cCSF); Isolated Visual <b>Perception</b> <b>Function</b> (iVPF); Contextual Visual <b>Perception</b> <b>Function</b> (cVPF). Results indicate that the measured cCSFs are lower in magnitude than the iCSFs and flatter in profile. Measured iVPFs, cVPFs and cCSFs are shown to have similar profiles. Barten’s contrast detection model 3 was shown to successfully predict iCSF. For a given frequency band, the reduction, or masking of cCSF compared with iCSF sensitivity is predicted from the linear amplification model (LAM) 4. We also show that our extension of Barten’s contrast discrimination model 1, 5 is capable of describing iVPFs and cVPFs. We finally reflect on the possible implications of the measured and modeled profiles of cCSF and cVPF to image quality modeling...|$|E
