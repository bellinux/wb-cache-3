40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the optimum design of {{cryogenic}} instruments requires accurate thermal models. The present models are limited by a lack of knowledge of the low temperature thermal conductance of the bolted joints which are typically used in the instrument-to-system interface. In connection with studies of <b>pressed</b> <b>contacts,</b> it has been found that the thermal conductance does not obey the Wiedemann-Franz law. The present investigation is concerned with the characterization of the thermal conductance of <b>pressed</b> <b>contacts</b> at liquid helium- 4 temperatures, taking into account the dependence of thermal contact conductance on applied force and temperature. It is shown that for the 0. 4 micron OFHC copper <b>pressed</b> <b>contact</b> pair, the thermal conductance varies roughly as the second power of the temperature, and increases with increasing applied force...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of cryogenic instruments {{is often a}} function of their operating temperature. Thus, designers of cryogenic instruments often are required to predict the operating temperature of each instrument they design. This requires accurate thermal models of cryogenic components which include {{the properties of the}} materials and assembly techniques used. When components are bolted or otherwise pressed together, a knowledge of the thermal {{performance of}} such joints are also needed. In some cases, the temperature drop across these joints represents a significant fraction of the total temperature difference between the instrument and its cooler. While extensive databases exist on the thermal properties of bulk materials, similar databases for <b>pressed</b> <b>contacts</b> do not. This has often lead to instrument designs that avoid <b>pressed</b> <b>contacts</b> or to the over-design of such joints at unnecessary expense. Although many people have made measurements of contact conductances at cryogenic temperatures, this data is often very narrow in scope and even more often it has not been published in an easily retrievable fashion, if published at all. This paper presents a summary of the limited <b>pressed</b> <b>contact</b> data available in the literature...|$|R
40|$|In battery applications, every {{electrical}} connection of battery cells {{is important because}} it influences functionality, efficiency, and safety. Increased contact resistances generate more heat at the affected terminals and if contact resistances of parallel-connected battery cells differ the current divides unequally. Amongst different techniques, detachable connections are easy to handle and have advantages for service, repair and recycling. Usually, detachable {{electrical connection}}s are based on the functional principle of <b>press</b> <b>contacts.</b> So, <b>press</b> <b>contacts</b> are frequently used for consumer batteries in electronic devices, for pouch battery cells in scientific tests, and for large battery cells with screw connections. This paper focusses on the electrical <b>contact</b> resistance of <b>press</b> <b>contacts</b> for battery cells. A novel measuring method to assess the contact resistance itself is presented. Common terminal and connector metals for battery cells and the dependence of their contact resistances on the contact pressure, surface roughness, and contact area are investigated and compared with welding techniques. Only if these dependencies are considered, contact resistances as low as for welded connections are achieved. Furthermore, due to its hard passivating Al 203 surface film, aluminum contacts need a certain surface roughness. The obtained results can serve for modeling and development of battery assemblies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This study {{deals with}} the power {{electronics}} packaging and the needs for additional knowledge about electrical <b>pressed</b> <b>contact</b> behavior. For this, a measure bench has been realized. It is able to characterize the pressed interface between a metal electrode and a power chip {{as a function of}} the clamping force (0 - 8000 N) and the temperature (up to 100 °C). First measurement results show that the electrical contact resistance is negligible compared to the chip on-state voltage. Second measurement results show that the high value of the chip metallization resistance masks also the contact resistance. Finally, it appears that it is necessary to estimate the chip contact zone influences on the current repartition. Then a method based on both, the use of a chip model and the measurements directly on the chip, has been developed. It is able to look for the steady state current repartition in the chip {{as a function of the}} contact zone and the chip metallization physical parameters.

40|$|I {{report on}} {{controlled}} comparison of gravitational approximation schemes linear/lognormal/adhesion/frozen-flow/Zel'dovich(ZA) and ZA's second [...] order generalization. In {{the last two}} cases we also created new versions of the approximation by truncation, i. e., by finding an optimum smoothing window (see text) for the initial conditions. The Zel'dovich approximation, with optimized initial smoothing, worked extremely well. Its second-order generalization was slightly better. The success of our best-choice {{was a result of}} the treatment of the phases of nonlinear Fourier components. The adhesion approximation produced the most accurate nonlinear power spectrum and density distribution, but its phase errors suggest mass condensations were moved somewhat incorrectly. Due to its better reproduction of the mass density distribution function and power spectrum, adhesion might be preferred for some uses. We recommend either n-body simulations or our modified versions of ZA, depending on the purpose. Modified ZA can rapidly generate large numbers of realizations of model universes with good accuracy down to galaxy group (or smaller) mass scales. Comment: 8 pp., plain TeX.

40|$|The {{cerebellum}} {{is involved}} in sensory-motor integration and cognitive functions. The origin and function of the field potential oscillations in the cerebellum, especially in the high frequencies, have not been explored sufficiently. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the spatio-temporal characteristics of high frequency field potentials (150 - 350 Hz) in the cerebellar cortex in a behavioral context. To this end, we recorded from the paramedian lobule in rats using micro electro-corticogram (µ-ECoG) electrode arrays while the animal performed a lever press task using the forelimb. The phase synchrony analysis shows that the high frequency oscillations recorded at multiple points across the paramedian cortex episodically synchronize immediately before and desynchronize during the lever press. The electrode contacts were grouped according to their temporal course of phase synchrony around the time of lever <b>press.</b> <b>Contact</b> groups presented patches with slightly stronger synchrony values in the medio-lateral direction, and did not appear to form parasagittal zones. The size and location of these patches on the cortical surface are in agreement with the sensory evoked granular layer patches originally reported by Welker’s lab (Shambes, 1978).
