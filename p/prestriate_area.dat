40|$|Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) {{learned a}} series of {{visuospatial}} configural discriminations in which particular discriminative stimulus objects were rewarded only in particular spatial locations. For example, object X was rewarded if {{it was on the}} left but not if it was on the right. After ablation of part of the dorsal prestriate cortex they were impaired in learning discriminations of this kind. The same animals were not impaired in learning visual object discriminations in which spatial position was irrelevant, nor in learning spatial discriminations in which object identity was irrelevant. The results were compared with previously reported results from fornix transection in the same tasks; the deficit following dorsal prestriate ablation in visuospatial configural discrimination learning was similar in severity to that which followed fornix transection. The results show that the dorsal <b>prestriate</b> <b>area</b> has a more general role in visuospatial processing than was known hitherto, and they suggest that it interacts with the hippocampal formation and fornix in visuospatial memory tasks...|$|E
40|$|A {{neural network}} model of 3 -D visual {{perception}} and figure-ground separation by visual cortex is introduced. The theory provides a unified explanation of how a 2 -D image may generate a 3 -D percept; how figures pop-out from cluttered backgrounds; how spatially sparse disparity cues can generate continuous surface representations at different perceived depths; how representations of occluded regions can be completed and recognized without usually being seen; how occluded regions can sometimes be seen during percepts of transparency; how high spatial frequency parts of an image may appear closer than low spatial frequency parts; how sharp targets are detected better against a figure and blurred targets are detector better against a background; how low spatial frequency parts of an image may be fused while high spatial frequency parts are rivalrous; how sparse blue cones can generate vivid blue surface percepts; how 3 -D neon color spreading, visual phantoms, and tissue contrast percepts are generated; how conjunctions of color-and-depth may rapidly pop-out during visual search. These explanations arise derived from an ecological analysis of how monocularly viewed parts of an image inherit the appropriate depth from contiguous binocularly viewed parts, as during DaVinci stereopsis. The model predicts the functional role and ordering of multiple interactions within and between the two parvocellular processing streams that join LGN to <b>prestriate</b> <b>area</b> V 4. Interactions from cells representing larger scales and disparities to cells representing smaller scales and disparities are of particular importance.

40|$|Extracellular {{recordings}} from single neurons of the <b>prestriate</b> <b>area</b> V 3 A {{were carried}} out in awake, behaving monkeys, to test {{the influence of the}} direction of gaze on cellular activity. The responsiveness to visual stimulation of about half of the studied neurons (88 / 187) was influenced by the animal's direction of gaze: physically identical visual stimuli delivered to identical retinotopic positions (on the receptive field) evoked different responses, depending upon the direction of gaze. Control experiments discount the possibility that the observed phenomenon was due to changes in visual background or in depth, depending on the direction in which the animal was looking. The gaze effect modulated cell excitability with different strengths for different gaze directions. The majority of these neurons were more responsive when the animal looked contralaterally with respect to the hemisphere they were recorded from. Gaze-dependent neurons seem to be segregated in restricted cortical regions, within area V 3 A, without mixing with non-gaze-dependent cells of the same cortical area. The most reliable differences between V 3 A gaze-dependent neurons and the same type of cells previously described in area 7 a (Andersen and Mountcastle, 1983) concern the small receptive field size, the laterality of gaze effect, and the lack of straight-ahead facilitated or inhibited neurons in area V 3 A. Since the present results show that V 3 A gaze-dependent neurons combine information about the position of the eye in the orbit with that of a restricted retinal locus (their receptive field), we suggest that they might directly encode spatial locations of the animal's field of view in a head frame of reference. These cells might be involved in the construction of an internal map of the visual environment in which the topographical position of the objects reflects their objective position in space instead of reflecting the retinotopic position of their images. Such an objective map of the visual world might allow the stability of visual perception despite eye movement...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a patient (P. S.) who, following a right prestriate lesion, reported that {{objects in the}} left visual field appeared distorted and smaller than those on the right. Other aspects of visual processing were remarkably unaffected, We carried {{out a series of}} size comparison tests using simple or complex stimuli and requiring different types of behavioural responses. We found that P. S. significantly underestimated the size of stimuli presented in her left visual field. When comparison tasks involved stimuli placed along the vertical axis or in the right visual field, P. S. performed well. The vertical and horizontal components of size distortion were found to be differentially affected. We conclude that size processing may be dissociated from other aspects of visual processing, such as form or colour processing, and depends critically on part of the occipital, <b>prestriate</b> <b>areas</b> (Brodmann areas 18 - 19) ...|$|R
40|$|Glucose {{metabolism}} {{has been}} studied in the visual cortex of early blind human subjects. In the forebrain of these subjects, regional glucose utilization was {{the highest in the}} striate and <b>prestriate</b> cortical <b>areas.</b> Furthermore, this activity was higher than in blindfolded sighted subjects, whether at rest or during an auditory or tactile task. These observations raise the question of the functionality of the blind's visual cortex...|$|R
40|$|THE perceptual {{world is}} {{organized}} hierarchically: the forest consists of trees, {{which in turn}} have leaves. Visual attention can emphasize the overall picture (global form) or the focal details of a scene (local components) 1. Neuropsychological {{studies have indicated that}} the left hemisphere is biased towards local and the right towards global processing. The underlying attentional and perceptual mechanisms are maximally impaired by unilateral lesions to the temporal and parietal cortex 2, 3. We measured brain activity of normal subjects during two experiments using 'hierarchically' organized figures. In a directed attention task, early visual processing (<b>prestriate)</b> <b>areas</b> were activated: attention to the global aspect of the figures activated the right lingual gyrus whereas locally directed attention activated the left inferior occipital cortex. In a subsequent divided attention task, the number of target switches from local to global (and vice versa) covaried with temporal–parietal activation. The findings provide direct evidence for hemispheric specialization in global and local perception; furthermore, they indicate that temporal–parietal areas exert attentional control over the neural transformations occurring in prestriate cortex...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of visual perception despite eye movements suggests the existence, {{in the visual}} system, of neural elements able to recognize whether a movement of an image occurring in a particular part of the retina is the consequence of an actual movement {{that occurred in the}} visual field, or self-induced by an ocular movement while the object was still in the field of view. Recordings from single neurons in area V 3 A of awake macaque monkeys were made to check the existence of such a type of neurons (called 'real-motion' cells; see Galletti et al. 1984, 1988) in this <b>prestriate</b> <b>area</b> of the visual cortex. A total of 119 neurons were recorded from area V 3 A. They were highly sensitive to the orientation of the visual stimuli, being on average more sensitive than V 1 and V 2 neurons. Almost all of them were sensitive to a large range of velocities of stimulus movement and about one half to the direction of it. In order to assess whether they gave different responses to the movement of a stimulus and to that of its retinal image alone (self-induced by an eye movement while the stimulus was still), a comparison was made between neuronal responses obtained when a moving stimulus swept a stationary receptive field (during steady fixation) and when a moving receptive field swept a stationary stimulus (during tracking eye movement). The receptive field stimulation at retinal level was physically the same in both cases, but only in the first was there actual movement of the visual stimulus. Control trials, where the monkeys performed tracking eye movements without any intentional receptive field stimulation, were also carried out. For a number of neurons, the test was repeated in darkness and against a textured visual background. Eighty-seven neurons were fully studied to assess whether they were real-motion cells. About 48 % of them (42 / 87) showed significant differences between responses to stimulus versus eye movement. The great majority of these cells (36 / 42) were real-motion cells, in that they showed a weaker response to visual stimulation during tracking than to the actual stimulus movement during steady fixation...|$|E
40|$|Neuropsychological {{evidence}} indicates that the global aspect of complex visual scenes is preferentially processed by the right hemisphere, and local aspects are preferentially processed by the left hemisphere. Using letter-based hierarchical stimuli (Navon figures), we recently demonstrated, in a directed-attention task, lateralized neural activity (assessed by positron emission tomography) in the left prestriate cortex during local processing, and in the right prestriate cortex during global processing. Furthermore, temporal-parietal cortex was critically activated bilaterally in a divided-attention task that involved varying the number of target switches between local and global levels of letter-based hierarchical stimuli. Little is known about whether such stimulus categories influence such hemispheric lateralization. We now present data on brain activity, derived from positron emission tomography, in normal subjects scanned during either local or global processing of object-based hierarchical stimuli. We again observe attentional modulation of neural activity in prestriate cortex. There is now greater right-sided activation for local processing and greater left-sided activation for global processing, which {{is the opposite of}} that seen with letter-based stimuli. The results suggest that the relative differential hemispheric activations in the <b>prestriate</b> <b>areas</b> during global and local processing are modified by stimulus category...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{cortical}} connections of area V 6 by injecting neuronal tracers into different retinotopic representations of this area. To this purpose, we ®rst functionally recognized V 6 by recording from neurons of the parieto-occipital cortex in awake macaque monkeys. Penetrations with recording syringes were performed in the behaving animals in order to inject tracers exactly at the recording sites. The tracers were injected into the central or peripheral ®eld representation of V 6 in different hemispheres. Irrespective of whether injections {{were made in the}} centre or periphery, area V 6 showed reciprocal connections with areas V 1, V 2, V 3, V 3 A, V 4 T, the middle temporal area/V 5 (MT/V 5), the medial superior temporal area (MST), the medial intraparietal area (MIP), the ventral intraparietal area (VIP), the ventral part of the lateral intraparietal area (LIPV) and the ventral part of area V 6 A (V 6 AV). No labelled cells or terminals were found in the inferior temporal, mesial and frontal cortices. The connections of V 6 with V 1, and with all the retinotopically organized <b>prestriate</b> <b>areas,</b> were organized retinotopically. Th...|$|R
40|$|The {{connection}} {{zones of}} cortical areas V 3, V 4, and V 5 (MT) with the thalamic pulvinar nucleus in the macaque monkey were identified. A combination of single- and dual-tracer techniques {{was used to}} study their topography and to establish whether these zones occupy separate or overlapping pulvinar territories. In each case, the retinotopic distribution of tracer in the pulvinar was charted by reference to its parallel distribution within the maps of cortical areas V 1 and V 2. Each of the areas V 3, V 4, and V 5 were found to connect with both the 1 degrees and the 2 degrees maps located within the inferior and lateral pulvinar nuclei and to respect the previously identified topographies of these maps. However, V 5 connects to a narrow zone lining the rostrolateral margin of the lateral and inferior pulvinar and V 4 to a broader zone within the body of these two nuclei, which is adjacent to but separate from the V 5 zone; the V 3 zone overlaps both. Focal injections into cortex produce columns of pulvinar label whose trajectory defines a line of isorepresentation. The lines of isorepresentation in the 1 degrees and 2 degrees maps are approximately linear and parallel and adopt a rostrolateral to caudomedial aids; in the 1 degrees map, this aids is roughly perpendicular to the facet of the inferior pulvinar that hes adjacent to the lateral geniculate nucleus. The connections of V 5 and V 4 can be modelled as successive zones along the aids of isorepresentation, with registered visual topographies. The scheme is extended by existing reports that inferotemporal cortex connects to the caudomedial pole of this aids-reflecting an occipitotemporal cortical gradient, in that V 1 and other <b>prestriate</b> <b>areas,</b> e. g., V 3, connect to the opposite pole. Thus a simple model of the mapped volume in the pulvinar arises, in which a unidimensional cortical topography is represented orthogonally to retinal topography. Adjoining this volume medially, within the inferior and medial pulvinar, is a second, heavier zone of V 5 connectivity, which is poorly topographic. Both the medial and the rostrolateral zones of V 5 connectivity may overlap with previously identified regions of tectal input to the pulvinar. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|We {{constantly}} {{make eye}} movements to bring objects of interest onto the fovea for more detailed processing. Activity in area V 4, a <b>prestriate</b> visual <b>area,</b> is enhanced at the location {{corresponding to the}} target of an eye movement. However, the precise role of activity in V 4 in relation to these saccades and the modulation of other cortical areas in the oculomotor system remains unknown. V 4 could {{be a source of}} visual feature information used to select the eye movement, or alternatively, it could reflect the locus of spatial attention. To test these hypotheses, we trained monkeys on a visual search task in which they were free to move their eyes. We found that activity in area V 4 reflected the direction of the upcoming saccade but did not predict the latency of the saccade in contrast to activity in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). We suggest that the signals in V 4, unlike those in LIP, are not directly involved in the generation of the saccade itself but rather are more closely linked to visual perception and attention. Although V 4 and LIP have different roles in spatial attention and preparing eye movements, they likely perform complimentary processes during visual search...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} age-related {{changes in}} object and spatial visual processing {{in two separate}} experiments. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in young and old subjects with positron emission tomography and H 2 (15) O during tests of face matching, location matching, and a control task. The task demands in the two experiments were identical, but the stimuli in Experiment II were constructed to equalize stimulus complexity across all three tasks. The old subjects performed more slowly than the young subjects in both experiments, and showed significantly slower reaction times during location matching compared to face matching in Experiment II. Both young and old subjects showed occipitotemporal rCBF activation during face matching and occipitoparietal activation during location matching when these conditions were compared to the control task. However, in both experiments and in both tasks, young subjects showed greater activation of <b>prestriate</b> cortex (Brodmann's <b>area</b> 18), and old [...] ...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} task of vision is the segregation of {{figure and ground}} in situations of spatial occlusion. Psychophysical {{evidence suggests that the}} depth order at contours is defined early in visual processing. We have analysed this process in the visual cortex of the alert monkey. The animals were trained on a visual fixation task which reinforced foveal viewing. During periods of active visual fixation, we recorded the responses of single neurons in striate and <b>prestriate</b> cortex (<b>areas</b> V 1, V 2, and V 3 /V 3 A). The stimuli mimicked situations of spatial occlusion, usually a uniform light (or dark) rectangle overlaying a grating texture of opposite contrast. The direction of figure and ground at the borders of these rectangles was defined by the direction of the terminating grating lines (occlusion cues). Neuronal responses were analysed with respect to figure-ground direction and contrast polarity at such contours. Striate neurons often failed to respond to such stimuli, or were selective for contrast polarity; others were non-selective. Some neurons preferred a certain combination of figure-ground direction and contrast polarity. These neurons were rare both in striate and prestriate cortex. The majority of neurons signalled figure-ground direction independent of contrast polarity. These neurons were only found in prestriate cortex. We explain these responses in terms of a model which also explains neuronal signals of illusory contours. These results suggest that occlusion cues are used at an early level of processing to segregate figure and ground at contours...|$|R
40|$|A {{neural network}} theory of : 3 -D vision, called FACADE Theory, is described. The theory proposes a {{solution}} of the classical figure-ground problem for biological vision. It does so by suggesting how boundary representations and surface representations are formed within a Boundary Contour System (BCS) and a Feature Contour System (FCS). The BCS and FCS interact reciprocally to form 3 -D boundary and surface representations that arc mutually consistent. Their interactions generate 3 -D percepts wherein occluding and occluded object completed, and grouped. The theory clarifies how preattentive processes of 3 -D perception and figure-ground separation interact reciprocally with attentive processes of spatial localization, object recognition, and visual search. A new theory of stereopsis is proposed that predicts how cells sensitive to multiple spatial frequencies, disparities, and orientations are combined by context-sensitive filtering, competition, and cooperation to form coherent BCS boundary segmentations. Several factors contribute to figure-ground pop-out, including: boundary contrast between spatially contiguous boundaries, whether due to scenic differences in luminance, color, spatial frequency, or disparity; partially ordered interactions from larger spatial scales and disparities to smaller scales and disparities; and surface filling-in restricted to regions surrounded by a connected boundary. Phenomena such as 3 -D pop-out from a 2 -D picture, DaVinci stereopsis, a 3 -D neon color spreading, completion of partially occluded objects, and figure-ground reversals are analysed. The BCS and FCS sub-systems model aspects of how the two parvocellular cortical processing streams that join the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus to <b>prestriate</b> cortical <b>area</b> V 4 interact to generate a multiplexed representation of Form-And-Color-And-Depth, or FACADE, within area V 4. Area V 4 is suggested to support figure-ground separation and to interact. with cortical mechanisms of spatial attention, attentive objcect learning, and visual search. Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) mechanisms model aspects of how prestriate visual cortex interacts reciprocally with a visual object recognition system in inferotemporal cortex (IT) for purposes of attentive object learning and categorization. Object attention mechanisms of the What cortical processing stream through IT cortex are distinguished from spatial attention mechanisms of the Where cortical processing stream through parietal cortex. Parvocellular BCS and FCS signals interact with the model What stream. Parvocellular FCS and magnocellular Motion BCS signals interact with the model Where stream. Reciprocal interactions between these visual, What, and Where mechanisms arc used to discuss data about visual search and saccadic eye movements, including fast search of conjunctive targets, search of 3 -D surfaces, selective search of like-colored targets, attentive tracking of multi-element groupings, and recursive search of simultaneously presented targets.
