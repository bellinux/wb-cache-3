40|$|Abstract Pausing {{strategies}} in read and spontaneous speech {{have been of}} significant interest for researchers since in literature {{it was observed that}} read speech and spontaneous speech pausing patterns do display some considerable differences. This, at least, is the case in the English language as it was <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>native</b> <b>speakers.</b> As to what may be the case in French, this study was conducted with a specific focus on the que particle. The study reports on the audio recordings <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>native</b> <b>speakers</b> of French (NSF), and aims to identify different silent pausing strategies as they were employed by these speakers. The audio recordings were provided in a twofold procedure: while 17 NSF watched the French version of the animated cartoon, Scrooge, and then commented on its various themes, 10 of these participants read a short story, Les Jumeaux aloud to a digital audio recorder. Considerable attention was given to pausing preceding (PP) and following (PF) the que particle in que phrases {{as well as to the}} duration of this particle. Obtained results display significant differences between pausing preceding and following que both in spontaneous and read speech. Pausing preceding que was observed to be significantly longer than the following position in read speech, in spontaneous speech, however, it was just the opposite...|$|E
40|$|Teaching {{listening}} {{skill is}} always challenging {{because it requires}} special media and method. Recently, podcast {{has been used as}} one of innovative media in teaching listening skill and {{it can be used to}} evaluate how much students understand authentic language <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>native</b> <b>speakers.</b> Therefore, this research was aimed at investigating the listening ability of EFL students in comprehending podcast material at Syiah Kuala University. The research focused on investigating the ability of EFL students in comprehending authentic podcast, in the form of both a short dialogue and monologue. Descriptive qualitative approach was undertaken to identify the ability of 20 students in comprehending podcast. The instrument used in this study was a test with 10 multiple- choice questions. The result of the test was analyzed by using data percentage score criteria proposed by Sudijono (1998). The result of analysis revealed that the total score obtained by the EFL students was 52. 5 % in average. Therefore, it can be concluded that the ability of EFL students at Syiah Kuala University in comprehending podcast was unsatisfactory. This result suggests that students be exposed more to authentic materials such as podcast to improve their ability in comprehending language <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>native</b> <b>speakers</b> of English...|$|E

In particular, this paper reviews our data on the geminate consonant and elongated vowel <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> English and Chinese <b>native</b> <b>speakers.</b> We observed features of temporal coordination during <b>native</b> Japanese <b>speakers</b> word production taking measurements of the geminate consonants and elongated vowels and compared these measurements with data from the nonnative speakers.

40|$|Japanese {{has been}} {{observed}} to have 2 versions of the H tone, the higher of which is associated with an accented mora. However, the distinction of these 2 versions only surfaces in context but not in isolation, leading to a long-standing debate over whether there is 1 H tone or 2.

The evidence {{is based on an}} analysis of F 0 of words that varied in length, accent condition and syllable structure, <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>native</b> <b>speakers</b> of Japanese at 2 speech rates.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study aims {{to apply}} the {{proposal}} of a connectionist version of Optimality Theory (Bonilha, 2004) in order {{to analyze the data}} which were previously considered in Alves (2004), regarding the acquisition, by Brazilian Portuguese speakers, of English complex codas which characterize the English morpheme “-ed”. The analysis which was carried out in Alves (2004), developed through the standard model of Optimality Theory, reached the conclusion that the acquisition of a second language may imply not only the constraints reranking, but also the acquisition of a new underlying representation which is able to lead to output forms which are similar to those <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>native</b> <b>speakers.</b> By considering the fact that, for a Connectionist OT, the phoneme does not exist as a mental representation, hence not constituting an underlying form, we intend to verify the adequacy of Connectionist Optimality Theory to revisit the analysis developed in Alves (2004) ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether native speakers of Japanese could attend to critical acoustic features while identifying lenis and aspirated among Korean alveolar stops. Most Japanese participants had studied Korean {{for more than}} one year at a university language center in Korea. Native speakers of Korean were also tested with the same task for comparison. Korean participants discriminated the phonemic contrast according to both VOT and F 0 or just F 0. In contrast, Japanese participants identified lenis and aspirated mostly based on VOT information. They correctly identified stimuli of the phonemes which a speaker produced distinctively in terms of VOT. When stimuli weren’t noticeably different in VOT, they confused the two phonemes. Unlike Korean participants, they hardly considered F 0 information. This result suggests that some training materials, although they were <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> <b>native</b> <b>speakers,</b> can’t lead L 2 learners to catch critical acoustic information of L 2 phonemes.
