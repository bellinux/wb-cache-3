40|$|Technology {{adoption}} {{has been}} seen as key to the development of more productive agriculture in lesser developed countries. But the adoption and adaptation of new agricultural technology occurs at the level of farm families where decisions are made based on perceived risks and benefits of the new technology, and its fit within the knowledge and practices of existing agricultural system. The processes and consequences of household decision-making are investigated using unidisciplinary methods of decision analysis involving statistical, mathematical, psychological, anthropological and econometric techniques brought together in a holistic manner. The study is focused in the Ada and Selale regions of the Central Ethiopian Highlands. The technologies studied are fertilizer, improved crop varieties, pesticides and cross-bred cows. Differences in goals and strategies of households are caused by inequalities in ownership of physical resources, and access to local institutions and indigenous knowledge. Village and regional institutions greatly influence access to physical (e. g. land) and non-physical (knowledge and information) resources. Successful intervention strategies are those that recognize region- and experience-specific potentials. When compared with physical resources, non-physical resources exert greater influence on decisions to adopt technologies and on the efficiency with which inputs are used in the production of grain and milk outputs. Producers are willing to take risks in enterprises in which they have the advantages of favourable location or experience. The degree of risk-averse behaviour of households reduces the probability of adopting technologies in both study sites. Natural factors (e. g. rainfall) and policy variables (e. g., land tenure and market) increase <b>production</b> risk. <b>Indigenous</b> <b>production</b> knowledge and schooling consistently reduce variability in production...|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{collapse}} of the Eastern Bloc and the breakup of the Soviet Union, passenger locomotives used in Russia had been sourced from Czechoslovakia. Afterwards these sources were considered too expensive and the Russian state sought to develop <b>indigenous</b> <b>production</b> of passenger rolling stock.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of large}} stocks, {{it was decided}} to focus early {{modernisation}} efforts at developing a new fuse rather than design the entire grenade for <b>indigenous</b> <b>production.</b> This was considered a logical choice as a number of Polish companies inherited production lines of German World War I grenade designs.|$|R

40|$|Greece yearly allocates a {{substantial}} part of its national income to defence and its defence burden is the highest among EU and NATO members. To meet the demand for military hardware it relies almost exclusively on imports, ranking among the largest conventional arms importers in the world. Despite efforts to develop a domestic defence industry, <b>indigenous</b> <b>production</b> only covers a limited proportion of Greece's demand for military equipment. The majority of weapons, including sophisticated and technologically advanced systems, are imported from the major arms producers. This paper critically surveys the Greek defence industrial base, its structure and recent performance, and assesses its future options.

50|$|Armscor pursued both covert arms {{deals and}} black market {{purchases}} {{in an effort}} to acquire restricted defence technologies as rapidly as possible. The experience of the embargo encouraged South African efforts in diversifying suppliers while assuming <b>indigenous</b> <b>production</b> of some paraphernalia. Availability of Western-style equipment and spares from Israel in particular helped compensate for the military effects of the UN embargo. Armscor officials used aggressive covert techniques to acquire technology, bartering through other public sector enterprises, front companies, foreign agents, and even civil organisations.|$|R
50|$|The Israelis have upheld {{substantial}} {{air superiority}} {{for most of}} this time with Israel able to operate almost unopposed; Israel enjoyes near air supremacy against targets anywhere within range in the Middle East and North Africa until today. Regarding aircraft procurement, Israel started with British and French designs, then transitioning to <b>indigenous</b> <b>production</b> and then also design before moving again to purchasing to American designs. The Arabs directly participating in these battles against Israel except for Jordan and to some extent Iraq have commonly used Soviet designs.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} global-local linkages {{for the development of}} <b>indigenous</b> <b>production</b> in cultural clusters by analyzing the interplay between the <b>indigenous</b> film <b>production</b> cluster in Toronto, Canada, and Hollywood's runaway productions. Global-local linkages are {{at the forefront of the}} current debate in cluster studies, the discussion has so far had only a limited impact on the research on cultural clusters. The paper identifies the limitations to the dominant cluster models to explain the difficulties for Toronto to develop its indigenous cultural cluster. The inclusion of the global linkages in the analysis of the Toronto film cluster provides a new insight into the current development potentials and barriers faced by the indigenous film industry.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the presence of foreign affiliates and product upgrading by Turkish manufacturing firms. The analysis suggests that Turkish firms in sectors and regions more likely to supply foreign affiliates tend to introduce more complex products, where complexity is captured using a measure developed by Hausmann and Hidalgo (2009). This finding is robust to controlling for omitted variables, sample selection and potential simultaneity bias. It is also in line with the view that inflows of foreign direct investment stimulate upgrading of <b>indigenous</b> <b>production</b> capabilities in host countries...|$|R
50|$|The Cinema of Wales {{comprises}} {{the art of}} film and creative movies made in Wales or by Welsh filmmakers either locally or abroad. Welsh cinema began in the late-19th century, led by Welsh-based director William Haggar. Wales continued to produce film of varying quality throughout the 20th century, in both the Welsh and English languages, though <b>indigenous</b> <b>production</b> was curtailed through a lack of infrastructure and finance, which prevented {{the growth of the}} industry nationally. Despite this, Wales has been represented in all fields of the film making process, producing actors and directors of note.|$|R
50|$|Papua New Guinea {{achieved}} independence during Iambakey's {{first term}} of office, concluding {{a decade of}} political development. Once elected to office, Iambakey oriented his political action to legislative means of securing, once again, a complex economic role for Papua New Guineans. During the preceding ten years, coffee production {{had come to be}} dominated by Highlanders. Although the percent of <b>indigenous</b> <b>production</b> of coffee was well ahead of other primary industries, marketing and processing was all handled by expatriates. As yet, Papua New Guineans were little more than agricultural laborers.|$|R
50|$|The {{system has}} been {{developed}} by the Naval Physical Oceanographic Laboratory, Kochi a laboratory under the DRDO in the southern Indian state of Kerala. Initial approval for the project was given in 1987 for their induction into the Navy's Foxtrot-class submarines and was further approved as a measure to shore up <b>indigenous</b> <b>production</b> in sonar technology following a review in 1990. By 1994, development of engineering models and factory testing had been completed. Further tests on the system began in 1997 on board the INS Karanj with a scheduled induction for 2002.|$|R
60|$|There {{were some}} curious-looking {{dogs in the}} valley. Dogs!—big, hairless rats rather; all with smooth, shining, {{speckled}} hides—fat sides, and very disagreeable faces. Whence could they have come? That {{they were not the}} <b>indigenous</b> <b>production</b> of the region, I am firmly convinced. Indeed, they seemed aware of their being interlopers, looking fairly ashamed, and always trying to hide themselves in some dark corner. It was plain enough they did not feel at home in the vale—that they wished themselves well out of it, and back to the ugly country from which they must have come.|$|R
40|$|The {{biofuels}} {{penetration rate}} target in Ireland for 2013 is 6 % by volume. In 2012 the fuel blend reached 3 %, with approximately 70 million litres of biodiesel and 56 million litres of ethanol blended with diesel and gasoline respectively. For January and February 2013, the blend rate had only reached 2. 7 %. The target of 10 % by 2020 remains which equates to approximately 420 million litres. Achieving the biofuels target would require 345 ktoe by 2020 (14, 400 TJ). Utilising the indigenous biofuels outlined {{in this paper}} leaves a shortfall of approximately 12, 000 TJ or 350 million litres (achieving 17 % of the 10 % target) that must be either be imported or met by other renewables. 70 % of <b>indigenous</b> <b>production</b> from one biodiesel plant is currently from TME and UCOME. If this remains for 2020 then only 30 % remains equating to approximately 10 million litres <b>indigenous</b> <b>production</b> for a second biodiesel plant (30 % of 21 + 13 million litres) which has planned capacity of 40 million litres (36, 000 t). In terms of the EU biofuels sustainability criteria, up to 2017, a 35 % GHG emissions reduction is required compared to fossil fuels. From 2017 onwards, a 50 % GHG reduction is required for existing installations and a 60 % reduction for new installations...|$|R
