5|$|The {{restored}} east range measures around 31m by 10m, with a <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> and crow-step gables. It is {{entered through}} a richly carved doorway, dated 1622 and initialled SWS for Sir William Sinclair, which gives {{access to the}} third floor. The three lower floors are cut into the rock, and each has four vaulted rooms, with a fifth in the south-east tower. These lower levels were used for service rooms, with the principal rooms in the two upper floors. At the lowest level was a kitchen, with a bakehouse above. On the exterior, gunloops are found on the south wall, with several shot-holes on the east.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{church of}} St Peter & St Paul is {{situated}} in {{the centre of the}} town. A church has been on the site since at least 1162, although the current tower dates from 1352. The building had fallen into disrepair during the 19th century, and the majority of the building is the result of an intensive restoration in 1910. This included restoring a <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> and adding new aisles, although the nave arches are original. In 1935, a new two manual Harrison & Harrison organ was installed, a fine example of a pneumatic action instrument. Recent years have seen the construction of several new facilities, such as the Bricstan room extension. The church lists itself as being of the low church branch of the Church of England. The church also hosts the town's Catholic congregation.|$|E
5|$|The monks' {{dormitory}} {{was on the}} {{top floor}} of the east range, a long room with a high <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> (the mark of which can still be seen on the transept wall) which ran the length of the building. This was entered by two staircases: the day stair went down into the cloister in the south-east corner; the night stair led into the south transept of the church to allow the monks to get easily from bed to choir at night. Initially the dormitory was an open hall, with the monks' beds placed along the walls, one under each of the small, slit-like windows. During the fourteenth century, when views of the necessity of sleeping in the same space together for the common life changed, the dormitory at Netley would, as at other houses, have been divided into sections with wooden dividers to give every monk his own private area, each leading off a central corridor. The treasury, a tiny vaulted room, was at the north end of the dormitory, preumably located for security at night.|$|E

5|$|The parish {{contains}} {{a total of}} 58 Grade II listed buildings, including a Grade II* listed barn, and the Church of the Holy Cross, a Grade I listed building. The church dates from the late 12th century with early 13th and 15th century additions, {{as well as a}} substantial restoration in 1863. The building itself consists of stone walls, a tiled roof, and a stone slated porch. The oldest part is the chancel, which dates from the 12th century with 15th century extensions. The north chapel was altered in 1331, and in its churchyard is the grave of famed Second World War Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery (Viscount Montgomery of Alamein). Other listed buildings include Barnfield House – three houses which were once separated all dating from 1550 with 20th century restorations. The house itself has a timber frame with a tiled roof, including a late medieval hall. Mill Court, another Grade II listed building, is a large house dating from the early 19th century with a low <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> and yellow brickwork, and became a listed building on 15 August 1985.|$|E
5|$|The New Parishes Act 1844 {{allowed for}} the {{creation}} of a parish for Chadderton, dedicated to St Matthew the Evangelist. Services were initially held in the stables of Chadderton Hall, and then in a temporary wooden structure opened in 1848. The Church of St Matthew was opened for the parish in 1857 by the then Bishop of Manchester, James Prince Lee. A steeple was added in 1881. Following the construction of this church, four followed. There are now several Anglican parishes, and within them daughter and mission churches, serving the town. The parish of St Matthew united with the neighbouring parish of St Luke, and the United Benefice of St Matthew with St Luke now lies within the Oldham West Deanery of the Diocese of Manchester. The parish of Christ Church, founded in 1870, which also contains the church of St Saviour's and Crossley Christian Centre, is one of the largest numerically in the township and lies on the border with Werneth. The parish of Emmanuel, now meeting in the St George's building on Broadway, was originally part of Christ Church parish. Also within this deanery is the Parish Church of St Mark, built in the early1960s. It is a blue brick building with a graduated slate <b>pitched</b> <b>roof,</b> and a rectangular brick steeple with a high gabled roof. It was granted Grade II listed building status in 1998.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{purposes}} of a roof is to resist water. Two broad categories of roofs are flat and <b>pitched.</b> Flat <b>roofs</b> actually slope up to 10° or 15° but are built to resist standing water. <b>Pitched</b> <b>roofs</b> are designed to shed water but not resist standing water which can occur during wind-driven rain or ice damming. Typically residential, <b>pitched</b> <b>roofs</b> are covered with an underlayment material beneath the roof covering material as a second line of defense. Domestic roof construction may also be ventilated to help remove moisture from leakage and condensation.|$|R
40|$|Wind {{tunnel model}} studies {{were carried out}} to {{determine}} the external wind pressure distributions on large, low-rise buildings with <b>roof</b> <b>pitches</b> of 15 degrees and 35 degrees. The studies showed {{a significant increase in the}} magnitude of the mean and peak negative pressure coefficients with an increase in length to span aspect ratio, on the downwind roof and leeward wall, near the windward gable-end of building with a steep 35 degrees <b>pitch</b> <b>roof,</b> for oblique approach winds. These oblique approach winds also generate large design wind load effects on the frames near the gable-end. There is little variation in mean and peak pressure coefficients with aspect ratio, across the frame of the building with a moderate 15 degrees <b>pitch</b> <b>roof.</b> AS/NZS 1170. 2, which specifies increased suction pressures with aspect ratio on the downwind roof slope and leeward wall of steep <b>pitch</b> <b>roof</b> buildings compared to the previous edition of the standard, provides satisfactory design wind load effects on frames near gable-end. However, some design load effects on frames near the gable-end of the 15 degrees <b>pitch</b> <b>roof</b> building are underestimated by AS/NZS 1170. 2...|$|R

25|$|In January 2003, {{an appeal}} to {{renovate}} the building was launched. Funds were generated from grants from the University of Manchester and Heritage Lottery Fund and donations {{from members of the}} public and companies in Manchester. The project, Unlocking the Rylands, demolished the third extension, refurbished parts of the old building and erected a <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> over its reinforced concrete roof. Champneys designed a <b>pitched</b> <b>roof</b> but Mrs Rylands was advised that an internal stone vault would reduce the fire risk and it was not built. The £17 million project was completed by summer 2007 and the library reopened on 20 September 2007.|$|E
25|$|Piazza S. Giovanni: This plaza is {{mentioned}} in documents {{as far back}} as the 12th century. The nearby church of San Giovanni plan, one nave only with four transversal arches supporting the <b>pitched</b> <b>roof,</b> was taken as a model for other Gubbio churches later on.|$|E

30|$|Similarly, <b>pitched</b> <b>roofs</b> (Roofs 2, 4, 9) were sampled using {{systematic}} transects, which {{permit the}} description of maximum variation across an environmental gradient over the shortest distance (Kent and Coker, 1994). The diversity of roof constructions from this primary survey was united for analysis because of the limited sample size but also through reference to the methodological approach of Buttschardt (2001), whose surveys included two <b>pitched</b> <b>roofs</b> {{in a sample of}} less than ten EGRs.|$|R

25|$|Some pillboxes were {{carefully}} constructed {{to resemble a}} quite different, innocent, structure: a haystack, a disused cottage, seaside kiosk, bus-stop shelter or railway signal box.

50|$|Another {{important}} distinction is between <b>pitched</b> green <b>roofs</b> and flat green <b>roofs.</b> <b>Pitched</b> sod <b>roofs,</b> a traditional feature of many Scandinavian buildings, {{tend to be}} of a simpler design than flat green roofs. This is because the <b>pitch</b> of the <b>roof</b> {{reduces the risk of}} water penetrating through the roof structure, allowing the use of fewer waterproofing and drainage layers.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{shapes of}} roofs are flat, mono-pitched, gabled, hipped, butterfly, arched and domed. There are many {{variations}} on these types. Roofs constructed of flat sections that are sloped {{are referred to}} as <b>pitched</b> <b>roofs</b> (generally if the angle exceeds 10 degrees). <b>Pitched</b> <b>roofs,</b> including gabled, hipped and skillion roofs, make up the greatest number of domestic roofs. Some roofs follow organic shapes, either by architectural design or because a flexible material such as thatch has been used in the construction.|$|R
