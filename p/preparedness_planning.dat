40|$|Abstract This thesis {{handles the}} subject about {{emergency}} preparedness. The {{cases that are}} chosen are Sweden and the tsunami catastrophe and Great Britain with the bombings in London. The purpose with this case study is to reveal what factors that are important for an adequate emergency <b>preparedness</b> <b>plan</b> by studying Sweden’s and Great Britain’s emergency <b>preparedness</b> <b>plans</b> and how they handled the two catastrophes. The questions for the report are as follows: 1. Why did Great Britain’s emergency <b>preparedness</b> <b>plan</b> on the London bombings function better than the Swedish in the tsunami catastrophe? 2. How was Sweden and Great Britain’s emergency <b>preparedness</b> <b>plans</b> formed and why were they formed like that? The results was that the British emergency <b>preparedness</b> <b>plan</b> was more adequate because they hade a better communication to their citizens and a better relationship to the media than the Swedish one had. Both countries followed the ideal model that the theory presented but the British took it one step further by having a better layout and deeper understanding for emergency <b>planning.</b> Keywords: Emergency <b>preparedness</b> <b>plan</b> Organisation Governmen...|$|R

40|$|Framing has {{previously}} been studied {{in the field of}} pandemic preparedness and global health governance and influenza pandemics have usually been framed in terms of security and evidence-based medicine on a global scale. This paper is based on the pandemic <b>preparedness</b> <b>plans,</b> published after 2009, from eight European countries. We study how pandemic preparedness is framed and how pandemic influenza in general is narrated in the plans. All plans contain references to ‘uncertainty’, ‘pandemic phases’, ‘risk management’, ‘vulnerability’ and ‘surveillance’. These themes were all framed differently in the studied <b>plans.</b> The <b>preparedness</b> <b>plans</b> in the member states diverge in ways that will challenge the ambition of the European Union to make the pandemic <b>preparedness</b> <b>plans</b> interoperable and to co-ordinate the member states during future pandemics...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 This study {{evaluated}} how museums {{help their}} employees return to workplace normalcy after {{a natural disaster}} affects their institution and professional lives, and to address what policies they used to facilitate this transition. The study focused on three key policies: disaster/emergency <b>preparedness</b> <b>plans,</b> business continuity plans, and employee assistance programs (EAPs). Recently, the museum field has pushed for their organizations {{to develop and implement}} a disaster <b>preparedness</b> <b>plan</b> as a core institutional policy. While museum disaster <b>preparedness</b> <b>plans</b> are effective in encompassing mitigation, response, and recovery actions for artifacts, they rarely include guidelines for how museum employees are regarded during the recovery phase of the disaster plan. Natural disasters create high levels of stress which can affect worker productivity, and can lead to high employee absenteeism and turnover. Business continuity plans and EAPs can offer a means to address this thesis, as employees are considered a mission-critical resource. A questionnaire was sent to 80 midsize, California museums in the Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco Bay areas. The majority of museums (79 %) indicated that they had a disaster <b>preparedness</b> <b>plan</b> in place, but not a business continuity plan (14 %) or an employee assistance program (30 %). Results concluded that museums are not utilizing these policies to help employees return to workplace normalcy...|$|R

We designed and implemented the exercises, reviewed the results, made recommendations, and as-sessed the role of outbreak simulation exercises in maintaining regional polio-free status. In addition, we performed {{a comprehensive review of}} the national plans of all WHO Member States in the European Region. Results. Three exercises, delivered during 2011 – 2013 (for the Balkans, United Kingdom, and the Caucasus and Ukraine), revealed that participating countries were generally prepared for poliovirus introduction, but the level of preparedness needed improvement. The areas in particular need of strengthening were national <b>preparedness</b> <b>plans,</b> initial response, plans for securing vaccine supply, and communications. Conclusions. Polio outbreak simulation exercises can be valuable tools to help maintain polio-free status and should be extended to other high-risk countries and subnational areas in the European Region and elsewhere...|$|R

50|$|Another concept {{important}} for understanding vulnerability in the United States is the climate gap. The climate gap is the inequitably {{negative impact on}} poor people {{and people of color}} due to the effects of climate change. Some of these negative impacts include higher cost of living expenses, higher incidences of heat related health consequences in urban areas that are likely to experience urban heat island effects, increased pollution in urban areas, and decreases in available jobs for poor people and people of color. Some suggested solutions to close the climate gap include suggesting legislative policies that would reduce the impact of climate change by reducing carbon emissions with the emphasis of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and toxic air pollution in neighborhoods that are already heavily impacted, usually urban centers. Other solutions include increasing access to quality health care for poor people and people of color, <b>preparedness</b> <b>planning</b> for urban heat island effects, identifying neighborhoods that {{are most likely to be}} impacted, investing in alternative fuel and energy research, and measuring the results of policy impacts.|$|E

40|$|In the {{developed}} countries the public expect society to be prepared for, and step in, if {{something out of the}} ordinary happens. This public pressure appears to have increased the demand for crisis <b>preparedness</b> <b>planning.</b> In crisis management the local authority serves as the first line of defence and will more or less always be involved in responding to crises. It is therefore important to study how they should work with <b>preparedness</b> <b>planning.</b> The overall aim of the research on which the present thesis is based has been to study how local authorities should shape their <b>preparedness</b> <b>planning</b> processes in order to enhance their ability to respond to crises. Organisations are different; they have dissimilar prerequisites and are vulnerable to different hazards. <b>Preparedness</b> <b>planning</b> must always be adapted to the specific conditions and there is thus no detailed model that fits all organisations. In this thesis I have addressed two research questions concerning <b>preparedness</b> <b>planning.</b> The first question addressed the factors preparedness planners and researchers perceived as vital to consider when shaping the process of <b>preparedness</b> <b>planning.</b> The second research question dealt with the implications crisis management has on the <b>preparedness</b> <b>planning</b> process. The answers to both research questions can be summarised as follows. While acknowledging that there is no “model planning” that will serve every local authority effectively, there were four implications that were perceived as vital. The first implication is that there are several aims of <b>preparedness</b> <b>planning,</b> and those aims might be in conflict with each other. The second implication, at the operational level to shape a <b>preparedness</b> <b>planning</b> process, {{is that there is a}} need to create a continuous process. Furthermore, I have found three different perspectives relevant for shaping this process. These are to address the organisation’s internal vulnerabilities, to deal with aspects of learning and to consider who should learn what and how. The third implication is that it will almost never be possible to completely “stick to the plan”. There will always be a need for improvisation. It is thus wise to plan for improvisation. The fourth and final implication is that one needs to be cautious when evaluating a plan in hindsight...|$|E
