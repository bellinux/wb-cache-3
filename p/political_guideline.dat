This {{is the focus of}} the present essay, which is structured upon two different, although related, topics. Firstly, the choice of the regulatory model best suited for the Internet is considered - the hard law and binding one, or the soft law and self-regulatory one - together with the issues of constitutional legitimacy arising from each model at the national and European levels. Secondly, attention is given to the specific experience of the Italian Internet Bill of Rights, drafted by a Commitee charged by President Boldrini and approved on November 23 rd, 2015, with a motion voted by a transversal majority in the Chamber of Deputies of the Italian Parliament. The basic legal questions concerning fundamental rights addressed by the Bill are analyzed, while underlining its value as a <b>political</b> <b>guideline</b> for the future legislator of the Internet...|$|E
40|$|Build up a {{harmonious}} society ‘Build up a Harmonious Society ’ {{is the political}} program recently proposed by China’s President Hu Jintao () as the major <b>political</b> <b>guideline</b> for today’s Chinese society in an amazing economic boom where people are competing for eco-nomic profits {{on the one hand}} and falling into a demoralizing space of ideological and ethical void on the other. President Hu defines his concept of harmonious society as ‘a society with socialist democracy and rule of law, fairness and justice, integrity and friendly love, fullness of vitality, social stability and orderliness, and harmonious interaction between human and nature’. 1 Since it targets both social cohesion and ecological harmony with Nature, it could be read as a Confucian Program with a certain Daoist overtone. From the vehement and hostile class strug-gle during the cultural revolution period to today’s political program for a harmo-nious society, China seems to be fulfilling the historical process predicted in Zhang Zai’s ((1020 – 1077) saying ‘when there are struggles there are hostilities, while all hostilities are at the end to be solved in harmony’. ...|$|E

40|$|From the author's introduction: "In 1978, Deng Xiaoping {{regained his}} {{leadership}} {{as the chairman}} of the Central Advisory Commission of the Chinese Communist Party, making him the most important leader in China. Under Deng's regime, China embarked on an unprecedented journey toward globalization. Economically, Deng and his team of reformers adopted a series of policies in an attempt to integrate China into the global economy. In the domestic economy, Deng's Economic Reform policies proceeded with privatization of public business sectors and expansion of private business sectors. In the outward or international economy, Deng employed and promoted the "open-door" policy that initiated foreign trade and investment. Deng and his team believed that "global economic integration not only would allow China to exploit her unique comparative advantage [abundant labor and a huge domestic market] in the emerging global economy, but the flow of Western technology, capital and management practices would also enable China to advance the ambitious goals of socialist modernization more rapidly" (Sharma 2009 : 55). Compared with economic reform, political reform in China was relatively slow and it was handled with tremendous caution. However, Deng still managed to transfer Mao's "class-struggle" political mentality into an economy-based <b>political</b> <b>guideline</b> (Sharma 2009 : 73 - 75). Deng introduced his theory of democracy 1 during the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Party Central Committee. Deng's democracy theory targets democracy as the central goal of the Chinese Communist Party, and it emphasizes "the institution of democracy, economic democracy {{and the development of a}} legal framework (Yu 2008 : 254 - 256). " This political reform allows more equal opportunities for free competitions and less authoritarian control over the citizens' social and political life (Sharma 2009 : 73 - 75). In order to further strengthen China's global power and to create a generation of global elites, Deng and his team implemented the One-Child Policy in the 1980 s, a state-coerced population control policy designed to reduce China's fertility rate in a relatively short period of time (Fong 2004 : 2 - 3). Beijing, the capital of China, was one of the Chinese cities that have been greatly affected by the One-Child Policy. A majority of Beijing urban youth born after the 1980 s were the sole bearers of their families. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} how unit managers within communal home care service for older people, convert <b>political</b> policy and <b>guidelines</b> into practical care, and how they within this process govern their personnel. The study was based on a qualitative method with a hermeneutic approach. Former research disclose that the process of converting <b>political</b> policy and <b>guidelines</b> and how unit managers govern personnel are somewhat tenuous. Previous research show structural shifts and reorganisations within public service consequently shaping todays structure of organizations and management. The study draws on eight interviews with unit managers within two municipalities in Sweden. To carry out our interviews we used a semi-structured interview guide followed with an analysis of our main results using Lipskys concept of discretion and Foucaults theory of governmentality. The results indicate that unit managers’ work, converting <b>political</b> policy and <b>guidelines</b> into practical care, are complex. The study shows that unit managers experience difficulties and differ in their ways in the process of adapting <b>political</b> policy and <b>guidelines</b> into practical care. Unit managers therefor find some of the guidelines more difficult to integrate than others. We find it important in this study to highlight the different ways unit managers work in the process of converting <b>political</b> policy and <b>guidelines,</b> and how they in the process govern their personnel. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aspires to}} reach a better {{understanding}} of policy transformation within the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) of the European Union (EU). In order to do so, a case study is conducted on a specific agreement within the CFSP, the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports (the EU Code). The study investigates the transformation of policy {{as a result of this}} specific agreement in order to say something about the CFSP in general. Much like the CFSP itself, the EU Code both establishes <b>political</b> <b>guidelines</b> for the behaviour of the individual member states (in the form of <b>political</b> <b>guidelines</b> for arms exports), while at the same time institutionalises EU cooperation on this issue. Understanding the cooperation on the EU Code may therefore teach us important lessons about the CFSP in general. The study found that the original formulation of the EU Code can be largely explained by Liberal Intergovernmentalism, which describes government interaction in a bargaining process where political agreements are reached at a macro-level. Accordingly, negotiated agreements, such as the EU Code, are a function of the national interests of the member states. However, over time, the practices of the micro-level institutional operation of the EU Code drifted away from original national positions. The study found that the analytical tools of Historical Institutionalism are better equipped to explain this process. The first intergovernmental stage is where member states arrive at agreed upon platforms. Over time, an increasing number of new decisions are reached within the institutional structures established in order to administer the EU Code. The study identified a process which lead to a transformation from the initial politically negotiated agreement, towards increasing practical interaction at various levels of bureaucracy. This process tends to follow its own path, sometimes beyond the agreed upon political platforms changing or undermining original national positions. This process of transformation may go a long way in explaining the dynamics of the CFSP...|$|R

Historian Irina Livezeanu notes that Tzara, who agreed with Stalinism and shunned Trotskyism, submitted to the PCF cultural demands during the writers' congress of 1935, even when his friend Crevel committed suicide to protest the adoption of socialist realism. At a later stage, Livezeanu remarks, Tzara reinterpreted Dada and Surrealism as revolutionary currents, and presented them as such to the public. This stance she contrasts with that of Breton, who was more reserved in his attitudes.|$|R
