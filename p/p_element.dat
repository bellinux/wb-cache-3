2500|$|P {{elements}} are {{a family of}} transposons that recently proliferated within the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. [...] The P elements have an extremely high transposition rate and induce sterility and abnormal gonad development in D. melanogaster (Johnson, 2). [...] The flies thus developed a maternally inherited technique for combating the invasive DNA and silencing the transposons, now known as P cytotype. P cytotype detects DNA sequences in areas of telomeric heterochromatin and silences those sequences when they are found elsewhere in the genome. This {{is referred to as}} the telomeric-silencing effect (TSE) (2). [...] Just two P elements in the telomere are enough to suppress over 80 other copies of the <b>P</b> <b>element</b> in the genome. [...] The cytoplasmic factor used for TSE builds up over generations and suppression of the transposons is not fully effective unless the fly’s female-line ancestors have had the <b>P</b> <b>element</b> for six generations (2).|$|E
2500|$|Multiple {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} concerning transgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly. [...] This organism has been a helpful genetic model for over 100 years, due to its well-understood developmental pattern. [...] The transfer of transgenes into the Drosophila genome has been performed using various techniques, including <b>P</b> <b>element,</b> Cre-loxP, and ΦC31 insertion. [...] The most practiced method used thus far to insert transgenes into the Drosophila genome utilizes P elements. The transposable P elements, also known as transposons, are segments of bacterial DNA that are translocated into the genome, without the presence of a complementary sequence in the host’s genome. [...] P elements are administered in pairs of two, which flank the DNA insertion region of interest. [...] Additionally, P elements often consist of two plasmid components, one known as the <b>P</b> <b>element</b> transposase and the other, the P transposon backbone. [...] The transposase plasmid portion drives the transposition of the P transposon backbone, containing the transgene of interest and often a marker, between the two terminal sites of the transposon. Success of this insertion results in the nonreversible addition of the transgene of interest into the genome. While this method has been proven effective, the insertion sites of the P elements are often uncontrollable, resulting in an unfavorable, random insertion of the transgene into the Drosophila genome.|$|E
2500|$|To {{overcome}} the limitations and low yields that transposon-mediated and Cre-loxP transformation methods produce, the bacteriophage ΦC31 {{has recently been}} utilized. Recent breakthrough studies involve the microinjection of the bacteriophage ΦC31 integrase, which shows improved transgene insertion of large DNA fragments that are unable to be transposed by P elements alone. This method involves the recombination between an attachment (attP) site in the phage and an attachment site in the bacterial host genome (attB). [...] Compared to usual <b>P</b> <b>element</b> transgene insertion methods, ΦC31 integrates the entire transgene vector, including bacterial sequences and antibiotic resistance genes. [...] Unfortunately, {{the presence of these}} additional insertions has been found to affect the level and reproducibility of transgene expression.|$|E
5000|$|All <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> have a {{canonical}} structure contain 31bp terminal inverted repeats and 11bp internal inverted repeats {{located at}} THAP {{domain of the}} transposase. The shorter and longest <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> are nonautonomous <b>elements.</b> The longest <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> encode transposase needed for transposition.|$|R
40|$|The {{incomplete}} <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> TP 5 and TP 6 are {{inserted in}} the TAS repeats near the left telomere of the Drosophila melanogaster X chromosome. These telomeric <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> repress P-induced gonadal dysgenesis and germ-line hypermutability in both sexes. However, their capacity to repress hypermutability is lost when they are transmitted patroclinously in a cross. TP 5 and TP 6 do not repress P-element activity in somatic cells, nor do they alter the somatic or germ-line phenotypes of P-insertion alleles. In the germ line, these elements suppress the phenotype of a P-insertion allele of the singed gene that is evoked by other <b>P</b> <b>elements,</b> presumably because these other elements encode repressor polypeptides. This suppression is more effective when the telomeric <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> are inherited maternally. Regulation by telomeric <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> parallels that of the P cytotype, a state that represses P-element activity in some strains of Drosophila. This state exists only in the germ line and is maternally transmitted along with the <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> themselves. Regulation by known repressor P polypeptides is not restricted to the germ line and does not require maternal transmission of the relevant <b>P</b> <b>elements.</b> Regulation by telomeric <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> appears to be epistatic to regulation by repressor P polypeptides...|$|R
40|$|In the P-M {{system of}} hybrid dysgenesis of Drosophila melanogaster, some M strains possess {{chromosomal}} <b>P</b> <b>elements.</b> The chromosomes {{from one of}} these pseudo-M strains reduced the instability of a P element-insertion mutation of the singed bristle locus. We suggest that this reduction {{is an indication of}} competition for a transposase that binds to the <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> on the chromosomes from the pseudo-M strain {{as well as to the}} <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> at the singed locus; the pseudo-M strain's <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> might therefore be said to titrate the transposase, reducing its availability to interact with the <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> at the singed locus. We hypothesize that a similar mechanism regulates the movement of <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> in the <b>P</b> strains of D. melanogaster, although in this case we propose that the titrating elements are extrachromosomal and that they are generated by the action of the transposase itself...|$|R
2500|$|To {{improve the}} {{location}} and precision of the transgenic process, an enzyme known as Cre has been introduced. [...] Cre {{has proven to be}} a key element in a process known as recombination-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). [...] While it has shown to have a lower efficiency of transgenic transformation than the <b>P</b> <b>element</b> transposases, Cre greatly lessens the labor-intensive abundance of balancing random P insertions. Cre aids in the targeted transgenesis of the DNA gene segment of interest, as it supports the mapping of the transgene insertion sites, known as loxP sites. [...] These sites, unlike P elements, can be specifically inserted to flank a chromosomal segment of interest, aiding in targeted transgenesis. [...] The Cre transposase is important in the catalytic cleavage of the base pairs present at the carefully positioned loxP sites, permitting more specific insertions of the transgenic donor plasmid of interest.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>P</b> <b>element</b> is a class II transposon, {{and moves}} by a DNA-based [...] "cut and paste" [...] mechanism. The {{sequence}} comprises 4 exons with 3 introns. Complete splicing of the introns produces the transposase enzyme, while alternative partial splicing of intron 1 and 2 leaving in only intron 3 encodes the <b>P</b> <b>element</b> repressor. The complete, autonomous <b>P</b> <b>element</b> encodes a transposase enzyme, which recognizes the 31 bp terminal inverted repeats of the <b>P</b> <b>element</b> and catalyzes <b>P</b> <b>element</b> excision and re-insertion. The complete element is 2907 bp; non-autonomous P elements contain an internal deletion of varying length which abolishes transposase production, but such elements {{can still be}} mobilized if transposase is encoded elsewhere in the genome. <b>P</b> <b>element</b> insertion and subsequent excision results {{in the production of}} 8 bp direct repeats, and the presence of such repeats is indicative of previous <b>P</b> <b>element</b> activity.|$|E
50|$|If {{there is}} an old <b>P</b> <b>element</b> near the gene of {{interest}} (with a broken transposase) you can remobilise by microinjection of the embryo with coding for transposase or transposase itself. The <b>P</b> <b>element</b> will often transpose within a few kilobases of the original location, hopefully affecting your gene of interest as for 'Insertional Mutagenisis'.|$|E
40|$|<b>P</b> <b>elements</b> {{have been}} found in several genomes outside of Drosophila, where they were {{initially}} found.

To probe chromatin environments, her lab developed a <b>P</b> <b>element</b> construct {{with a copy of}} the white gene driven by the hsp70 promoter. When this reporter gene is inserted into heterochromatic environments, the fly eyes display a vareigating phenotype, whereas when the <b>P</b> <b>element</b> is inserted into euchromatin the fly eyes show a red phenotype; this phenomenon is known as Position-effect variegation. Nuclease digestion assays have confirmed that the eye phenotypes are indicative of the chromatin environment surrounding the <b>P</b> <b>element</b> insertion site.

40|$|In Drosophila melanogaster, {{hybrid dysgenesis}} {{occurs in the}} {{germline}} of flies produced by crosses between females lacking <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> and males carrying 25 - 55 <b>P</b> <b>elements.</b> We have previously shown that a complete maternally inherited repression of P transposition in the germline (P cytotype) can be elicited by only two autonomous <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> located at the X chromosome telomere (cytological site 1 A). We have tested whether P transgenes at 1 A, unable to code for a P-repressor, {{may contribute to the}} repression of <b>P</b> <b>elements.</b> Females carrying a P-lacZ transgene at 1 A ["P-lacZ(1 A) "], crossed with P males, do not repress dysgenic sterility in their progeny. However, these P-lacZ(1 A) insertions, maternally or paternally inherited, contribute to P-element repression when they are combined with other regulatory <b>P</b> <b>elements.</b> This combination effect is not seen when the P-lacZ transgene is located in pericentromeric heterochromatin or in euchromatin; however a P-w,ry transgene located at the 3 R chromosome telomere exhibits the combination effect. The combination effect with the P-lacZ(1 A) transgene is impaired by a mutant Su(var) 205 allele known to impair the repression ability of the autonomous <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> at 1 A. We hypothesized that the combination effect is due to modification of the chromatin structure or nuclear location of genomic <b>P</b> <b>elements...</b>|$|R

50|$|With his wife, Zuzana Zachar. he {{demonstrated}} that transposon insertion mutations {{were responsible for}} most of the alleles used in the development of classical genetics. (Zachar and Bingham, 1982). He also collaborated with Carl Wu and Sarah Elgin (then at Harvard) on fundamental properties of metazoan chromatin structure (Wu, et al., 1979). In collaboration with Margaret Kidwell, then at Brown University, and Gerry Rubin, then at the Carnegie Institution), he carried out the molecular cloning of the <b>P</b> <b>element</b> transposon in Drosophila (Bingham, et al., 1982). This work revolutionized the retrieval of genes in Drosophila and subsequently contributed to progress in metazoan molecular and developmental genetics. He and his collaborators were the first to propose the use of <b>P</b> <b>element</b> transposon tagging to clone the first metazoan RNA polymerase subunit (Searles et al., 1982). This work demonstrated that the <b>P</b> <b>element</b> is a recently invading parasite of the Drosophila genome and gene pool. Thus, P became the first clearly defined metazoan example of this long-suspected phenomenon.|$|E

50|$|P {{elements}} are transposable elements that {{were discovered in}} Drosophila as the causative agents of genetic traits called hybrid dysgenesis. The transposon is responsible for P trait of <b>P</b> <b>element</b> and it is found only in wild flies.|$|E
40|$|<b>P</b> <b>elements</b> {{inserted}} at {{the left}} end of the Drosophila X chromosome were isolated genetically from wild-type P strains. Stocks carrying these elements were tested for repression of P-strain-induced gonadal dysgenesis in females and for repression of transposase-catalyzed P-element excision in males and females. Both traits were repressed by stocks carrying either complete or incomplete <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> inserted near the telomere of the X chromosome in cytological region 1 A, but not by stocks carrying only nontelomeric X-linked <b>P</b> <b>elements.</b> All three of the telomeric <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> that were analyzed {{at the molecular level}} were inserted in one of the 1. 8 -kb telomere-associated sequence (TAS) repeats {{near the end of the}} X chromosome. Stocks with these telomeric <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> strongly repressed P-element excision induced in the male germline by a P strain or by the transposase-producing transgenes H(hsp/CP) 2, H(hsp/CP) 3, a combination of these two transgenes, and P(ry(+), delta 2 - 3) 99 B. For H(hsp/CP) 2 and P(ry(+), delta 2 - 3) 99 B, the repression was also effective when the flies were subjected to heat-shock treatments. However, these stocks did not repress the somatic transposase activity of P(ry(+), delta 2 - 3) 99 B. Repression of transposase activity in the germline required maternal transmission of the telomeric <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> themselves. Paternal transmission of these elements, or maternal transmission of the cytoplasm from carriers, both were insufficient to repress transposase activity. Collectively, these findings indicate that the regulatory abilities of telomeric <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> are similar to those of the P cytotype...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} compare the {{population}} dynamics of <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> in the sibling species D. melanogaster and D. simulans, three sets of studies were performed. In a series of comparative mixed population experiments, P-M mixed populations of D. melanogaster evolved into P or Q populations, depending {{on the strength of}} the P strains used as the original parental strains. However, no mixed populations of D. simulans evolved into P populations; even when the strongest P strains of D. simulans were used, all mixed populations evolved into Q or M' populations. Using an excision assay system, excision frequencies in a variety of strains of D. melanogaster and D. simulans were measured. On average, excision frequencies of <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> from plasmids were significantly lower in D. simulans than in D. melanogaster. In addition, there were no statistically significant correlations between GD sterility and excision frequencies. Using single neomycin -marked <b>P</b> <b>elements,</b> transposition frequencies of <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> were compared in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. As with excision frequencies, transposition frequencies were lower in D. simulans than in D. melanogaster. In addition, the position of the original insertion site had a strong effect on transposition frequency. All of these three experiments showed significantly lower average activity of <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> in D. simulans than in D. melanogaster. This consistency suggests that the three sets of results were influenced either directly and/or indirectly by common factors, such as host-encoded factors. Therefore, differences in the activity of <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> in these two species may be influenced by different host-encoded factors. The absence of <b>P</b> <b>elements</b> in natural populations of D. simulans may also be explained by the presence of different host factors...|$|R

A low-molecular-weight form dominated in resting cells, while a higher-molecular-weight form appeared after mitogenic stimulation. Southwestern analysis showed that the low-molecular-weight pd-binding protein had a molecular mass of 35 kDa, which was confirmed by fractionation by denaturating polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and molecular sieving. The higher-molecular-weight complex was sensitive to detergent treatment, while the low-molecular-weight complex was not.
