25|$|Some of {{the ancient}} {{descriptions}} suggest that some south-pointing chariots could move in only three ways: straight ahead, or turning left or right with a fixed radius of curvature. A third wheel might {{have been used to}} fix the turning radius. If the chariot was turning, the pointing doll was connected by gears to one or other of the two main road wheels (e.g. whichever was {{on the outside of the}} curve around which the chariot was moving) so the doll rotated at a fixed speed, relative to the rate of the chariot's movement, to compensate for the <b>predetermined</b> <b>rate</b> of turn. The doll turned in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was connected to it, so its rotation compensated for the chariot turning left or right. This design would have been simpler than using a differential gear.|$|E

40|$|<b>Predetermined</b> {{overhead}} <b>rate</b> {{is based}} on estimates rather than actual result. This is because the <b>predetermined</b> overhead <b>rate</b> is computed before the period begins and is used to apply overhead cost throughout the period. Companies typically base their <b>predetermined</b> overhead <b>rates</b> on the estimated, or budgeted, amount of allocation base (cost drivers) for the upcoming period. The purpose {{of this research is}} to compare PT Kusumahadi Santosa’s <b>predetermined</b> overhead <b>rate</b> based on the traditional costing with those rate computes or bases on the activity-based costing (ABC). PT Kusumahadi Santosa’s manufacturing overhead cost data (primary data) is used to reach the purpose. PT Kusumahadi Santosa is the manufacturer that process threads into cloth materials. The result of this research as follows. PT Kusumahadi Santosa’s applied overhead cost base on <b>predetermined</b> overhead <b>rates</b> computes on the traditional costing (uses machine hours allocation base) is Rp 51. 324, 044, 510, 00, while those applied overhead cost based on <b>predetermined</b> overhead <b>rates</b> computes on ABC is Rp 53. 926. 959. 944, 00. We conclude if PT Kusumahadi Santosa uses cost plus pricing to set the price of his products, those products is underpricing. This because the overhead cost is under applied. We suggest that PT Kusumahadi Santosa use ABC to compute and to apply the manufacturing overhead cost in order to calculate his product inventory cost and set his product price properly. ...|$|R
