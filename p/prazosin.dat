Synephrine constrictions were also antagonized by BRL-15,572, but not by SB-216,641 (used here as a selective 5-HT1B antagonist), or by propranolol (a common β antagonist).|$|E
25|$|Evidence that synephrine {{might have}} some central effects comes from the {{research}} of Song and co-workers, who studied the effects of synephrine in mouse models of anti-depressant activity. These researchers observed that oral doses of 0.3 – 10mg/kg of racemic syephrine were effective in shortening the duration of immobility produced in the assays, but did not cause any changes in spontaneous motor activity in separate tests. This characteristic immobility could be counteracted by the pre-administration of <b>prazosin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tamsulosin and {{silodosin}} are selective α1 receptor blockers that preferentially bind to the α1A receptor in {{the prostate}} {{instead of the}} α1B receptor in the blood vessels. Less-selective α1 receptor blockers such as terazosin and doxazosin may lower blood pressure. The older, less selective α1-adrenergic blocker <b>prazosin</b> is not a first line choice for either high blood pressure or prostatic hyperplasia; it is a choice for patients who present with both problems at the same time. The older, broadly non-selective alpha blocker medications such as phenoxybenzamine are not recommended for control of BPH. Non-selective alpha blockers such as terazosin and doxazosin may also require slow dose adjustments as they can lower blood pressure and cause syncope (fainting) if {{the response to the}} medication is too strong.|$|E

50|$|<b>Prazosin</b> is orally {{active and}} has a minimal effect on cardiac {{function}} due to its alpha-1 receptor selectivity. However, when <b>prazosin</b> is started, heart rate and contractility go up {{in order to maintain}} the pre-treatment blood pressures because the body has reached homeostasis at its abnormally high blood pressure. The blood pressure lowering effect becomes apparent when <b>prazosin</b> is taken for longer periods of time. The heart rate and contractility go back down over time and blood pressure decreases.|$|E
5000|$|Common (4-10% frequency) {{side effects}} of <b>prazosin</b> include dizziness, headache, drowsiness, lack of energy, weakness, palpitations, and nausea. Less {{frequent}} (1-4%) side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, edema, orthostatic hypotension, dyspnea, syncope, vertigo, depression, nervousness, and rash. A very rare side effect of <b>prazosin</b> is priapism.

50|$|In cancer research, <b>Prazosin</b> {{triggered}} apoptosis of glioblastoma‐initiating {{cells and}} of their differentiated progeny, inhibited glioblastoma growth in orthotopic xenografts of patient‐derived glioblastoma‐initiating cells, and increased survival of glioblastoma‐bearing mice.

Clinical trials will be initiated to confirm these findings. Understanding the mechanism of action of <b>prazosin</b> may {{pave the way for}} the development of new potential treatments also for other cancers, since other cancer cells as well display altered PKCδ signaling, including those in colorectal, pancreatic and liver cancer.|$|E

The CAPS and the Clinical Global Impressions-Change scale (CGI-C) were the primary outcome measures. Patients who were taking <b>prazosin</b> had a robust improvement in overall sleep quality (effect size, 1.6) and recurrent distressing dreams (effect size, 1.9). In each of the PTSD symptom clusters the effect size was medium to large: 0.7 for reexperiencing or intrusion, and 0.6 for avoidance and numbing, and [...]9 for hyperarousal. The reduction in CGI-C scores (overall PTSD severity and function at endpoint) also reflected a large effect size (1.4). <b>Prazosin</b> appears to have promise as an effective treatment for PTSD-related sleep disturbance, including trauma-related nightmares, as well as overall Anxiety and PTSD symptoms.|$|E

50|$|Treatment {{is mainly}} symptomatic. Local pain is treated by injecting {{dehydroemetine}} {{at the site}} of the sting. Hypovolaemia is corrected by oral rehydration solution. Agitated, confused and non-cooperative patients are given a 5% dextrose saline drip. Patients with hypertension on admission are given a single dose of 5 mg sublingual nifedipine and oral <b>prazosin.</b> The blood pressure in patients with hypertension is controlled with sublingual nifedipine alone. Patients with pulmonary oedema are propped up and given intravenous aminophylline, intravenous sodium bicarbonate, oral <b>prazosin,</b> and oxygen by mask.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Prazosin,</b> {{trade names}} Minipress, Vasoflex, Lentopres and Hypovase, is a sympatholytic drug {{used to treat}} high blood pressure, anxiety, and {{posttraumatic}} stress disorder (PTSD). It is an &alpha;1-blocker which acts as an inverse agonist at alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. [...] These receptors are found on vascular smooth muscle, where {{they are responsible for}} the vasoconstrictive action of norepinephrine. [...] They are also found throughout the central nervous system. As of 2013, <b>prazosin</b> is off-patent in the US, and the FDA has approved at least one generic manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|Doxazosin {{and similar}} {{medications}} like <b>prazosin</b> {{have been found}} to help reduce the intensity of and/or stop posttraumatic stress disorder night terrors and nightmares. The full explanation for this effect is not understood.|$|E
50|$|The alpha blocker <b>prazosin</b> (Minipress) is {{most notorious}} for {{producing}} a first dose phenomenon. Other drugs {{of the same}} family, doxazosin (Cardura) and terazosin (Hytrin), can also cause this phenomenon, though less frequently.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, many H. tamulus stings were recorded, {{as many as}} four each week, again {{mostly in}} women and children. Usually, the drug <b>Prazosin</b> is {{recommended}} for H. tamulus stings. The drug can reduce the increasing blood pressure.|$|E
50|$|Use of a {{beta blocker}} such as {{propranolol}} is contraindicated in Prinzmetal's angina. <b>Prazosin</b> {{has also been}} found to be of value in some patients. Coronary revascularization is only useful when the patient shows concomitant coronary atherosclerosis on coronary angiogram.|$|E
50|$|<b>Prazosin</b> is {{also useful}} in {{treating}} urinary hesitancy associated with prostatic hyperplasia, blocking alpha-1 receptors, which control constriction {{of both the}} prostate and urethra. Although not a first line choice for either hypertension or prostatic hyperplasia, it is a choice for patients who present with both problems concomitantly.|$|E
50|$|An {{adrenergic}} antagonist is {{a pharmaceutical}} substance that acts to inhibit {{the action of}} catecholamines at the adrenergic receptors. It is thus a type of sympatholytic. Many important and commonly prescribed medications are adrenergic antagonists, including <b>prazosin</b> and propranolol. Like all pharmacological receptor antagonists, adrenergic antagonists only show an effect when the receptor's effector is present.|$|E
50|$|Orthostatic {{hypotension}} and syncope {{are associated}} with the body's poor ability to control blood pressure without active alpha-adrenergic receptors. Patients on <b>prazosin</b> should be told to rise to stand up slowly, since their poor baroreflex may cause them to faint if their blood pressure is not adequately maintained during standing. The nasal congestion is due to dilation of vessels in the nasal mucosa.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause is}} not clear. It occurs more {{commonly}} {{in patients who}} are salt and fluid volume depleted (as happens due {{to the use of}} diuretics), or were using beta blockers. Diuretics and beta blockers are frequently used to control hypertension. For this reason, treatment with <b>prazosin</b> (Minipress) should always be initiated with a low dose and should be taken at bedtime to avoid standing position.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis and {{medication}} {{can only be}} given to patients that report the recurring nightmares to a psychiatrist or other physician. Medications like <b>prazosin</b> are sometimes used to treat nightmares in people with PTSD. Therapy usually helps {{to deal with the}} frightening themes of the nightmares and alleviate the recurrence of the dreams. The persistent nightmares will usually improve as the patient gets older. Treatments are generally very successful.|$|E

(See also receptor antagonist) ...|$|E
50|$|The first-dose {{phenomenon}} is {{a sudden and}} severe fall in blood pressure that can occur when changing from a lying to a standing position {{the first time that}} an alpha blocker drug is used or when resuming the drug after many months off. This postural hypotension usually happens shortly after the first dose is absorbed into the blood and can result in syncope (fainting). Syncope occurs in approximately 1% of patients given an initial dose of 2 mg <b>prazosin</b> or greater. This adverse effect is self-limiting and in most cases does not recur after the initial period of therapy or during subsequent dose titration.|$|E
50|$|Several {{classes of}} {{antihypertensive}} agents are recommended, {{with the choice}} depending on the etiology of the hypertensive crisis, {{the severity of the}} elevation in blood pressure, and the usual blood pressure of the patient before the hypertensive crisis. In most cases, the administration of an intravenous sodium nitroprusside injection, which has an almost immediate antihypertensive effect, is suitable (but in many cases not readily available). In less urgent cases, oral agents like captopril, clonidine, labetalol, or <b>prazosin</b> can be used, but all have a delayed onset of action (by several minutes) compared to sodium nitroprusside. Controlled bloodletting is an effective salvage therapy in the interim when nitroprusside is unavailable, and aggressive oral therapy has not yet taken effect.|$|E
50|$|The venom mainly {{affects the}} {{cardiovascular}} and pulmonary system, eventually {{leading to a}} pulmonary oedema, which may cause death. Scorpion antivenom has little effect in clinical treatment but application of <b>prazosin</b> reduces the mortality rate to less than 4%.As in other scorpions, the venom of H. tamulus consists of a complex mixture of proteins. Some major components have been isolated, including the toxin tamapin. Scorpion envenomation with high morbidity and mortality is usually due to either excessive autonomic activity and cardiovascular toxic effects or neuromuscular toxic effects. Antivenin is the specific treatment for scorpion envenomation combined with supportive measures including vasodilators in patients with cardiovascular toxic effects and benzodiazepines when there is neuromuscular involvement. Although rare, severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis to scorpion antivenin (SAV) are possible.|$|E

5000|$|Either {{surgical}} option requires prior {{treatment with}} the non-specific and irreversible alpha adrenoceptor blocker phenoxybenzamine or a short acting alpha antagonist (e.g. <b>prazosin,</b> terazosin, or doxazosin). Doing so permits the surgery to proceed while minimizing {{the likelihood of}} severe intraoperative hypertension (as might occur when the tumor is manipulated). Some authorities would recommend that a combined alpha/beta blocker such as labetalol also be given in order to slow the heart rate. Regardless, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker such as propranolol must never {{be used in the}} presence of a pheochromocytoma. The mechanism for β-adrenoceptor blocker-associated adverse events is generally ascribed to inhibition of β2-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation, leaving α1-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictor responses to catecholamines unopposed and, thus, severe and potentially refractory hypertension. However some clinical guidelines permit beta-1 blockade use together with alpha blockers during surgery for control of tachycardia.|$|E
50|$|Benzodiazepines are not {{recommended}} {{for the treatment of}} PTSD {{due to a lack of}} evidence of benefit and risk of worsening PTSD symptoms. Some authors believe that the use of benzodiazepines is contraindicated for acute stress, as this group of drugs promotes dissociation and ulterior revivals. Nevertheless, some use benzodiazepines with caution for short-term anxiety and insomnia. While benzodiazepines can alleviate acute anxiety, there is no consistent evidence that they can stop the development of PTSD and may actually increase the risk of developing PTSD 2-5 times. Additionally, benzodiazepines may reduce the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions, and there is some evidence that benzodiazepines may actually contribute to the development and chronification of PTSD. For those who already have PTSD, benzodiazepines may worsen and prolong the course of illness, by worsening psychotherapy outcomes, and causing or exacerbating aggression, depression (including suicidality), and substance use. Drawbacks include the risk of developing a benzodiazepine dependence, tolerance (i.e., short-term benefits wearing off with time), and withdrawal syndrome; additionally, individuals with PTSD (even those without a history of alcohol or drug misuse) are at an increased risk of abusing benzodiazepines. Due to a number of other treatments with greater efficacy for PTSD and less risks (e.g., prolonged exposure, cognitive processing therapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, cognitive restructuring therapy, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy, brief eclectic psychotherapy, narrative therapy, stress inoculation training, serotonergic antidepressants, adrenergic inhibitors, antipsychotics, and even anticonvulsants), benzodiazepines should be considered relatively contraindicated until all other treatment options are exhausted. For those who argue that benzodiazepines should be used sooner in the most severe cases, the adverse risk of disinhibition (associated with suicidality, aggression and crimes) and clinical risks of delaying or inhibiting definitive efficacious treatments, make other alternative treatments preferable (e.g., inpatient, residential, partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient, dialectic behavior therapy; and other fast-acting sedating medications such as trazodone, mirtazapine, amitripytline, doxepin, <b>prazosin,</b> propranolol, guanfacine, clonidine, quetiapine, olanzapine, valproate, gabapentin).|$|E
5000|$|Reoccurring {{post-traumatic}} stress disorder nightmares in which real traumas are re-experienced respond well to a technique called imagery rehearsal. First described in the 1996 book Trauma and Dreams by Harvard psychologist Deirdre Barrett, this contemporary dream interpretation involves dreamers coming up with alternative, mastery outcomes to the nightmares, mentally rehearsing those outcomes awake, and then reminding themselves at bedtime that they wish these alternate outcomes should the nightmares reoccur. Research has found that this technique not only reduces the occurrence of nightmares and insomnia, but also improves other daytime PTSD symptoms. According to Bret Moore and Barry Kraków, the most common variations of Imagery Rehearsal Therapy (IRT) [...] "relate {{to the number of}} sessions, duration of treatment, {{and the degree to which}} exposure therapy is included in the protocol". Another kind of treatment not only helping the reduction of nightmares, sleep disturbance, and other PTSD symptoms is <b>prazosin.</b> There have been multiple studies conducted under placebo-controlled conditions. (Am J Psychiatry 2003; 160:371-373)A comprehensive model has been put forth by Krakow and Zadra (2006) that includes four group treatment sessions, ~2.25 to 2.5 hr in length. The first two sessions focus on how nightmares are closely connected to insomnia and how they become an independent symptom or disorder that warrants individually tailored and targeted intervention. The last two sessions focus on the imagery system and how IRT can reshape and eliminate nightmares through a relatively straightforward process akin to cognitive restructuring via the human imagery system. First, the patient is asked to select a nightmare, but for learning purposes the choice would not typically be one that causes a marked degree of distress. Second, and most commonly, guidance is not provided on how to change the disturbing content of the dream; the specific instruction developed by Joseph Neidhardt is [...] "change the nightmare anyway you wish" [...] (Neidhardt et al., 1992). In turn, this step creates a [...] "new" [...] or [...] "different" [...] dream, which may or may not be free of distressing elements. Our instructions, unequivocally, do not make a suggestion to the patient to make the dream less distressing or more positive or to do anything other than [...] "change the nightmare anyway you wish." [...] Last, the patient is instructed to rehearse the [...] "new dream" [...] through imagery and to ignore the old nightmare.p. 234 ...|$|E
40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{studied the}} effect of counterion on the glass transition and recrystallization behavior of amorphous salts of <b>prazosin.</b> Three amorphous salts of <b>prazosin,</b> namely, <b>prazosin</b> hydrochloride, <b>prazosin</b> mesylate and <b>prazosin</b> tosylate were prepared by spray drying, and characterized by optical-polarized microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction. Modulated differential scanning calorimetry {{was used to determine}} the glass transition and recrystallization temperature of amorphous salts. Glass transition of amorphous salts followed the order: <b>prazosin</b> mesylate > <b>prazosin</b> tosylate ~ <b>prazosin</b> hydrochloride. Amorphous <b>prazosin</b> mesylate and <b>prazosin</b> tosylate showed glass transition, followed by recrystallization. In contrast, amorphous <b>prazosin</b> hydrochloride showed glass transition and recrystallization simultaneously. Density Functional Theory, however, suggested the expected order of glass transition as <b>prazosin</b> hydrochloride > <b>prazosin</b> mesylate > <b>prazosin</b> tosylate. The counterintuitive observation of amorphous <b>prazosin</b> hydrochloride having lower glass transition was explained in terms of its lower activation energy (206. 1 kJ/mol) for molecular mobility at Tg, compared to that for amorphous <b>prazosin</b> mesylate (448. 5 kJ/mol) and <b>prazosin</b> tosylate (490. 7 kJ/mol), and was further correlated to a difference in hydrogen bonding strength of the amorphous and the corresponding recrystallized salts.

40|$|Hypothalamic peptidergic neurones {{possess an}} uptake process for amines (transport-P), for which <b>prazosin</b> is a substrate. It is {{characterized}} by a paradoxical increase in the accumulation of [3 H]-prazosin when the concentration of unlabelled <b>prazosin</b> is increased above 10 − 7 [*]M. This increase is due to activation of a proton-dependent, vacuolar-type ATPase-linked pump that is blocked by tricyclic antidepressants. This study utilized a fluorescence method to detect amine uptake in individual cells. <b>Prazosin</b> is fluorescent but most of its emission spectrum is in the ultraviolet range. We therefore used an analogue of <b>prazosin</b> in which the furan ring had been substituted with a fluorescent group, BODIPY[*]FL. This compound's emission maximum is in the green part of the visible spectrum. BODIPY FL <b>prazosin</b> accumulated in immortalised peptidergic neurones and the characteristic emission spectrum of the compound was evident in these cells. Accumulation of BODIPY[*]FL <b>prazosin</b> was saturable and was inhibited by the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine and by unlabelled <b>prazosin.</b> As previously described for <b>prazosin,</b> uptake of BODIPY[*]FL <b>prazosin</b> was blocked by cold temperature and by the organic base chloroquine. Thus, <b>prazosin</b> and BODIPY[*]FL <b>prazosin</b> were accumulated by the same uptake process. BODIPY[*]FL <b>prazosin</b> accumulated in a granular distribution, which is compatible with storage in intracellular vesicles. Hypothalamic cells from foetal rats in primary culture also accumulated BODIPY[*]FL <b>prazosin</b> by a desipramine-sensitive process.
