5000|$|The {{institute}} {{was under}} the supervision of the ministry of religion, which appointed the teachers upon nomination by the council (consisting of twelve clerical and twelve lay members), of which M. Schweiger was president and Dr. J. Simon secretary, ever since 1877. The course of study extended over ten years and was divided into two equal periods; one being devoted to the lower department, the other to the upper. The former corresponded to an [...] "Obergymnasium"; and the requirement for admission was the <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>diploma</b> from an [...] "Untergymnasium", or the passing of an entrance examination covering a certain amount of Hebrew and Talmudics in addition to secular studies. The diplomas from this department were recognized by the state, and commanded admittance into any department of the universities or schools of technology. After the completion of the courses offered by the upper department, including attendance under the faculty of philosophy at the university, a year of probation followed. This was concluded in February by an oral examination after the candidate had presented three written theses on Biblical, rabbinic-Talmudic, and historical or religious-philosophical subjects respectively. At graduation he received a rabbinical diploma, which was recognized by the state. To supplement the regular course of training there were students' societies in both departments.|$|E
40|$|Using the National Longitudinal Transition Study database, {{this study}} {{explored}} predictors of postschool employment for 412 youth identified as severely emotionally disturbed (SED). This research focused {{on the relationship between}} postschool employment and (a) personal variables, (b) the receipt of coun-seling or therapy in school, and (c) the receipt of vocational training in school.

50|$|Reserve Officers (ROs) are {{selected}} among draftees with sufficient educational and physical qualifications. Educational qualifications include possessing a secondary education Lykeion diploma, while physical qualifications are determined in <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> standardized athletic tests.

40|$|The present {{evaluation}} of Early Head Start concerns {{the effects of}} household income and mother’s education on child cognitive development. A secondary data analysis is performed on the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation study public use file, in which cognitive development is measured using the Bayley Mental Development Index and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Household income is measured as <b>a</b> percentage <b>of</b> the federal poverty level, with households earning up to 100 percent of the poverty level annually considered low income. Mother’s education is determined by <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high school <b>diploma.</b> Results of multiple and simultaneous linear regressions are presented. Early Head Start is found to positively affect cognitive development among children whose mothers have earned <b>a</b> high school <b>diploma,</b> while its effectiveness for low income households is less significant.

40|$|Many {{different}} types of qualification requirement {{and other forms of}} regulations of professions exist in the Member States of the European Union. A common qualification requirement for access to a profession or use of a professional title is the <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>diploma,</b> certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications that proves that the person in questions has the education and experience necessary. The aim of the thesis is to examine what legal strategies the Community has developed to counteract the obstacle against free movement of workers and self-employed persons that national qualifications of this types gives rise to. The analysis is performed using an integration perspective and with its basis in the tensions between European Community law and national law that arise as Community law’s demands for free movement and equal treatment conflict with the interest of the Member States to set their own professional qualifications in accordance with national values and traditions. Central to the examination are the directives on recognition of professional qualifications adopted by the Council and the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice’s case-law on the subject. A central tasks is to analyse the contents of Community law and to study those rules from a development perspective...|$|E
