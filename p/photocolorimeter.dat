The main ground pepper quality attributes are extractable color, surface color, qualitative and quantitative carotenoid content. In this work, the influence of heat treatment on ground pepper quality was investigated. Microbiological status was examined in non-sterilized and sterilized ground pepper. Color changes were assessed by measuring the extractable color (ASTA) and surface color, using a <b>photocolorimeter.</b> The obtained results showed that at the end of experiment, non-sterilized samples had higher color values in comparison to the sterilized ones. Also, color deterioration was heightened at room temperature...|$|E

This study evaluates the prevalence of anaemia in pregnant women attending the outpatient clinic in a semi-urban hospital {{for a period of}} six months. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data from a sample of 500 pregnant women was collected and the patients were screened for anaemia on their booking visit in KFMS&R for a period of six months from March-August 2015. Haemoglobin was estimated by cyanmethaemoglobin method using Systronic <b>photocolorimeter</b> on their first antenatal visit. The degree of anaemia was categorised according to ICMR datamild (10 - 10. 99 g/dL), moderate (7 - 9. 99 g/dL), severe (< 7 g/dL).

40|$|The {{potential}} of heterogeneous photocatalysis using TiO 2 immobilized in alginate beads was evaluated for {{the degradation of}} tartrazine yellow azo dye. The treatment was performed under the action of a high-pressure mercury vapor lamp of 125 W and the degradation performance was investigated with the absorbance supplied by a <b>photocolorimeter.</b> Alginate beads with TiO 2 were prepared and the catalyst was quantified by thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and specific area analysis (BET). The immobilization was performed as a very simple and reproductible technique. The bead diameter was approximately 1 mm and its surface presented a homogeneous dispersion of catalytic sites containing about 1 - 2 % (w/w) of TiO 2. The TiO 2 /alginate beads presented low density and can be easier separated than the TiO 2 dispersed from the reacting medium, remaining available to be reused in another batch. The dye degradation reached 30 % after 120 minutes of irradiation, for the following conditions: alcaline pH (pH= 9. 0), 3 g of TiO 2 /alginate beads and 20 mol L- 1 dye concentration...|$|E
40|$|Masticatory {{efficiency}} is always compromised in complete denture patients. The denture teeth with compromised occlusal anatomy and material further compound the inherent limitations of complete dentures. To compare the masticatory efficiency {{of patients with}} complete denture using acrylic and metal occlusal posterior teeth. Ten edentulous patients with well-formed ridges were selected. Complete dentures using acrylic and metal occlusal posterior teeth were fabricated. The masticatory efficiency was calculated using photo colorimeter. Complete dentures with 20 ° acrylic resin posterior teeth were fabricated for ten edentulous patients and masticatory efficiency was measured using raw beetroot as test food on a <b>photocolorimeter</b> after 10, 15, 20 strokes. The acrylic resin posterior teeth were replaced with metal occlusal posterior teeth on the same denture base. The masticatory efficiency {{was measured by the}} same method. The mean average percentage of masticatory efficiency with acrylic resin teeth and metal occlusal teeth were first calculated and statistical analysis was done using students unpaired t test. The average masticatory efficiency with acrylic teeth was 46. 46 % and metal occlusal teeth was 65. 62, ‘t’ =  5. 38. The difference between the mean average masticatory performance percentage with acrylic teeth and metal occlusal teeth was significant at 1 % i. e. P <  0. 01. Within the limitation of this study the average percentage value of masticatory efficiency improves considerably when metal occlusal teeth replace normal acrylic teeth without any alteration in position or relation...|$|E

The aim was also to evaluate the effect of breed, age at slaughter, weight at slaughter, sex, content of intramuscular fat and feed on changes in meat colour. Lightness (L*), redness (a*), yellowness (b*), chroma (C*) and hue (h) of CIELab system were measured by spectrophotometer Konica Minolta CM 2600 d in all analyzed samples. In selected samples both remission and content of colour pigments were measured using <b>photocolorimeter</b> Spekol 11 and by modified method according to Hornsey. According to the results pork meat was affected by selected biological factors in the smallest range. Sex of the fattening pigs (hogs and gilts) had not significant effect on meat colour, on none of the monitored parameters. Neither sire lines did affect colour meat parameters.

40|$|Blood-red {{hawthorn}} (Crataegi fructus) are {{a popular}} cardiotonic herbal materials, which {{widely used in}} medical practice in our country and abroad. In order to prevent diseases of the cardiovascular system is appropriate to prescribe herbal medicines, because they combine the breadth and softness of therapeutic action, along with {{the absence of a}} significant number of side effects and contraindications. The purpose was to study diuretic and antidepressant activity of thick fruit extract of blood-red hawthorn. Material and methods. Under laboratory conditions we obtained a thick extract of blood-red hawthorn fruits. This phytopharmaceutical was studied by us for any diuretic and antidepressant activity. Investiga- tions were carried out on white rats of both sexes weighing 200 – 220 g. Each experimental group consist- ed of ten animals. Study drug was administered intragastrically by stomach tube. Control in both cases served as purified water. For determination of diuretic activity, we used a thick extract of hawthorn fruits in a dose of 20 mg/kg against the background of the water load in the amount of 3 % of body weight of the animal. Reference preparation was chosen dichlorthiazid 20 mg/kg. It was administered once. After ad- ministration the animals were placed in metabolic cages for urine collection for 24 hours. The study de- termined diuresis, natriuresis, kaliuresis, and kreatininuresis for 4 h and 24 h of the experiment. On the day of the experiment the animals of the control group was administered water load of 3 %, and experi- enced – intragastrically drug in an identical amount. Animals were placed in a metabolic cage for a day. Collected 4 h and 24 -h urine sample. Determined by renal excretion of water was recorded concentration of sodium and potassium by flame photometry in the fiery liquid analyzer PAG- 1, creatinine – colorimet- ric method for <b>photocolorimeter</b> CFC- 3. For determining antidepressant activity we used a thick hawthorn extract in a dose of 25 mg/kg of animal body weight. As a synthetic drug comparisons, we used amitriptilin 5 mg/g. Results. It was found that the thick extract of fruits of blood red hawthorn in a dose of 20 mg/kg for 24 hours increases the diuresis experiment, both by increasing the glomerular filtration rate and by lowering tubular reabsorption. For thick extract of fruits of hawthorn blood-red characteristic expression antide- pressant activity. Conclusion. The studied preparation of blood-red hawthorn’s fruits have properties to provide complex nephrotropic and neurotropic activity on the living organism. </p...|$|E
