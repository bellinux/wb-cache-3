2500|$|Labor {{relations}} {{consultants and}} attorneys specialize in multiple disciplines such as labor law, supervisory training, bargaining, arbitration and mediation, and compensation analysis. [...] Firms and organizations which specialize in countering organizing campaigns typically work with company management and supervisors {{to focus on}} techniques intended to influence worker attitudes regarding collective action. [...] Labor relations consultants and attorneys are not only employed by management during labor actions but often before any organizing is apparent. Contemporary consultancies have developed union avoidance programs aimed at non union companies which focus on training managers and supervisors in techniques called [...] "preventive labor relations". Non-union corporations spend considerable resources employing <b>professional</b> <b>consultancies</b> to audit their organizations {{in order to understand}} and solve issues before employees seek union representation. This practice of seeking information and doing supervisory training about how not to commit infractions is termed by trade unions as union busting.|$|E
5000|$|Outside {{of holiday}} times, {{meetings}} {{seem to have}} altered little with time and place. They comprised discussion, readings and songs. There was no public worship, no instruction, no prayer. There is no record of any participant being moved by the spirit. Until mid-Victorian times, London meetings were held in the back rooms of pubs. In the early days, this {{is said to have}} provided an appearance of outward conformity with the Conventicle Acts 1664 and 1667. The meeting would look and sound to outsiders like a private or family party. Nothing would advertise religious observance. By 1869, pub life had become irksome and the London congregation obtained their first Reading Room at 7 New Street, which was reckoned to be built on the former site of Lodowicke Muggleton's birthplace, Walnut Tree Yard. This was made possible by legacies from Catherine Peers, Joseph Gandar and the Frost family; all of whom had been active in the faith. The money invested in government stock yielded sufficient income to pay the rent and the wages of a live-in caretaker who, for most of the Victorian period, was an unemployed shoe-repairer named Thomas Robinson. 7 New Street is perhaps the only site with Muggletonian connections still extant. However, it may require considerable historical imagination from the modern passer-by to gain a mental picture of what it would have been like in Victorian times. Then, the area was full of warehouses and factories, not the smart, <b>professional</b> <b>consultancies</b> of today. For his visit in 1913, Williamson tellingly describes it as being [...] "in the East End" ...|$|E

The papers may be {{work of a}} topical interest or require presentation outside the conventions of a normal journal article. A formal editorial process ensures that standards of quality and objectivity are maintained. In this paper, Sylvia Rohlfer, a doctoral student attached to IRRU, analyses what is understood by the ‘key players ’ involved in ‘benchmarking’, within a comparative context looking at Germany and the UK. She undertakes a content analysis of the key components of benchmarking in the leading texts, and uses this to examine the position and role of employer organisations, <b>professional</b> <b>consultancies,</b> trade unions and government bodies in the dissemination and implementation of benchmarking at company level. Rohlfer concludes with a critique of benchmarking that deconstructs the conventional presentation of a benign and objective technique and instead argues that context is vital to its application and ‘success’. In particular, this implies that the different employment relations systems {{of the two countries}} shape the use and form of company-level benchmarking in different ways...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the market}} for professional (expert) services where the experts are motivated by reputational concerns. A key feature of such markets, which is often overlooked, is that clients can have specific characteristics that affect their evaluation of the service, and (or) the likelihood the service can be provided successfully. These different characteristics can induce clients to choose between experts with different reputations. The paper shows that clients choices have an important impact on the incentives of experts to provide a high quality service. In particular, sorting of clients affects incentives through three channels: changes {{in the types of}} client who are indifferent between getting the service from experts of different reputation, changes in the information on good performance as a signal of an expert's talent, and changes in the average complexity of the service the expert provides which impacts on the marginal efficiency of effort. The paper also investigates under what conditions increased entry of experts increases their incentives to exert effort. The results of the model can be applied {{to examine the effects of}} entry into the markets for doctors, lawyers, <b>professional</b> <b>consultancies.</b> reputation, competition, sorting, experts, entry...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new insights}} on {{the workings of}} the market for expert services and investigates the e¤ects of entry on the incentives of experts to provide high quality services. Experts are motivated by reputational concerns and clients are characterized by an unobservable type which a¤ects their willingness to pay for the service and may a¤ect the informativeness of the performance of the expert as a signal of her talent, and the likelihood the expert succeeds in providing a high quality service. The paper shows that clients sorting a¤ects incentives through three channels: modifying current and future equilibrium fees, modifying the informativeness of good performance as a signal of expert talent, modifying the marginal e ¢ ciency of e¤ort. Entry of experts impacts the sorting behaviour of clients in equilibrium, and thus incentives of experts. The main result is that increased entry reduces incentives to exert e¤ort, although when clients types a¤ect the likelihood the service is provided successfully the opposite may occur. However, even when e¤ort is lower in equilibrium after increased entry, welfare may be larger as more clients can be served. The results of the model can be applied to examine the e¤ects of entry in such markets as investment banking services, lawyers, <b>professional</b> <b>consultancies...</b>|$|E

The traditional skill-based pedagogies in design education confront the tremendous challenges in the globalized world. In this new era, the aim and objective of design education is supposed to educate a creative knowledge maker, instead of a conventional designer with professional skills only, for the creative industries in all disciplines. The creative knowledge worker is expected to provide <b>professional</b> <b>consultancies</b> in creativity as well as the strategic planning of design management. Thus, creativity studies in design education plays a crucial role in empowering design students’ competencies in the global market. Therefore, design educators need to seriously review and evaluate the ongoing creativity trainings in design education in able to equip students for these challenges. Echo to the structural changes in creative industries and professional design education in globalized world, this paper aims to explore the fundamental challenges and the role of creativity studies in tertiary design education. Emphasis is given to discuss the (1) impact of the ‘Globalization’ in tertiary design education in Hong Kong; (2) role of creativity studies in design education; (3) the ways of teaching creative thinking as a professional knowledge in design education; (4) obstacles to reshaping the orthodox pedagogy of design education in Hong Kong.
