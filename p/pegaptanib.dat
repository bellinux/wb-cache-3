50|$|<b>Pegaptanib</b> {{underwent}} several preclinical {{studies in}} order to determine its safety and efficacy before moving into clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pegaptanib</b> is a {{pegylated}} anti-vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) aptamer, a single strand of nucleic acid that binds with specificity {{to a particular}} target. <b>Pegaptanib</b> specifically binds to the 165 isoform of VEGF, a protein that plays {{a critical role in}} angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) and increased permeability (leakage from blood vessels), two of the primary pathological processes responsible for the vision loss associated with neovascular AMD.|$|E
50|$|After {{the success}} of the Phase I and Phase II trials, the FDA granted fast track {{designation}} for the Phase III clinical trials. In these trials, <b>pegaptanib</b> was studied in two identical controlled, double-blind randomized clinical studies that lasted for approximately two years each. For this study approximately 1200 patients with neovascular ("wet") age-related macular degeneration were randomly put into groups to receive either a placebo treatment or the designated 0.3 mg, 1 mg, or 3 mg of <b>pegaptanib</b> administered intravitreal injections every 6 weeks. Of the 1200 patients enrolled in the study approximately 892 received the varying doses of <b>pegaptanib</b> and approximately 298 received the placebo injection. At {{the end of the first}} year, patients continuing the study were re-randomized for the second year.|$|E
50|$|The {{average cost}} of <b>pegaptanib</b> was {{approximately}} $5,300 per 5 syringes in the US. In 2004, when <b>pegaptanib</b> was approved it was a novel drug in its target and treatment {{for the treatment of}} AMD. However, the last large market sales occurred in 2010. Shortly after in 2011, sales began to decline due {{to the development of a}} more effective treatment, ranibizumab (a monoclonal antibody, Novartis) being developed and sold, and the off-label use of the cheaper Bevacizumab.|$|E

50|$|A 2014 Cochrane Systematic Review {{studied the}} {{effectiveness}} of two anti-VEGF treatments, ranibizumab and <b>pegaptanib,</b> on patients suffering from macular edema caused by CRVO. Participants on both treatment groups showed a reduction in macular edema symptoms over six months.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pegaptanib</b> {{works as}} an {{antagonist}} to VEGF, which when injected into the eye blocks the actions of VEGF. This then reduces {{the growth of the}} blood vessels located within the eye and works to control the leakage and swelling.|$|E
50|$|A 2014 Cochrane Systematic Review {{studied the}} {{effectiveness}} of ranibizumab and <b>pegaptanib,</b> on patients suffering from macular edema caused by central retinal vein occlusion.

50|$|Toxicology {{studies were}} {{conducted}} in rhesus monkeys, guinea pigs, rats, mice, and rabbits. After {{the administration of the}} aptamer into rhesus monkeys, no toxic effects where exhibited. It was also noted that there was no change in intraocular pressure and no immune response was taken against the API. Aside from the intravitreal administration of the <b>pegaptanib,</b> it was also found that subcutaneous and intravenous routes of administration were also effective at maintaining the desired blood plasma concentration. In rats, <b>pegaptanib</b> was successful at blocking VEGF-mediated vascular leakage almost entirely. The sustained release of the drug was tested in rabbits. It was found that using poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) microspheres, which encapsulated the drug, the minimum dosing frequency was 6 weeks to maintain the desired pharmacological effect. This dosing interval is what carried over into the clinical trials and is still maintained today.|$|E

50|$|In {{a series}} of {{parallel}} and collaborative preclinical studies, Dr. Miller and colleagues effectively blocked ocular neovascularization with a VEGF-neutralizing antibody (bevacizumab), a VEGF-neutralizing antibody fragment (ranibizumab), and a VEGF-neutralizing aptamer EYE001 (later known as <b>pegaptanib).</b> These studies not only reinforced VEGF's key role in ocular pathology, but also provided the scientific foundation for clinical trials of multiple anti-VEGF therapies. In July 2005, Dr. Miller presented data from the Phase III MARINA trial of ranibizumab (Lucentis) at the 23rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Retina Specialists (ASRS) in Montreal, Canada.|$|E
50|$|After {{the success}} of the Phase I study, Eyetech {{completed}} a Phase II study focusing on multiple injections. In this study, 21 patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to AMD were given multiple intravitreal injections. Due to the presence of subfoveal CNV some patients were given a secondary treatment, photodynamic therapy (PDT) for this condition. Results showed that in 87.5% of patients who received only <b>pegaptanib,</b> vision stabilized or improved. In patients who received PDT alone only 50.5% saw a slight improvement. However, when the two therapies were administered together, the level of improvement reached 60% or better.|$|E
50|$|A {{randomized}} control trial {{found that}} bevacizumab and ranibizumab had similar efficacy, and reported no {{significant increase in}} adverse events with bevacizumab. A 2014 Cochrane review found that the systemic safety of bevacizumab and ranibizumab are similar when used to treat neovascular AMD, except for gastrointestinal disorders. Bevacizumab however is not FDA approved for treatment of macular degeneration. A controversy in the UK involved the off-label use of cheaper bevacizumab over the approved, but expensive, ranibizumab. Ranibizumab is a smaller fragment, Fab fragment, of the parent bevacizumab molecule specifically designed for eye injections. Other approved antiangiogenic drugs {{for the treatment of}} neo-vascular AMD include <b>pegaptanib</b> and aflibercept.|$|E

[...] OSI has also made a foray into the ophthalmology market through a marketing agreement with Pfizer over Macugen (<b>Pegaptanib)</b> for Age-related macular degeneration; however, acquisition of the firm Eyetech, meant to provide control over this product and diversify the company, has been unsuccessful, ending in divestiture.|$|E
5000|$|CNV is {{conventionally}} {{treated with}} intravitreal injections of angiogenesis inhibitors (also known as [...] "anti-VEGF" [...] drugs) to control neovascularization {{and reduce the}} area of fluid below the retinal pigment epithelium. Angiogenesis inhibitors include <b>pegaptanib,</b> ranibizumab and bevacizumab (known {{by a variety of}} trade names, such as Macugen, Avastin or Lucentis). These inhibitors slow or stop the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), typically by binding to or deactivating the transmission of vascular endothelial growth factor ('VEGF'), a signal protein produced by cells to stimulate formation of new blood vessels. The effectiveness of angiogenesis inhibitors has been shown to significantly improve visual prognosis with CNV, the recurrence rate for these neovascular areas remains high.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the cause of the {{retinopathy}} and may include laser therapy to the retina. Laser photocoagulation therapy has been the standard treatment for many types of retinopathy. Evidence show that laser therapy is generally safe and improves visual symptoms in sickle cell and diabetic retinopathy. In recent years targeting the pathway controlling vessel growth or angiogenesis has been promising. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) seems to {{play a vital role in}} promoting neovascularization. Using anti-VEGF drugs (antibodies to sequester the growth factor), research have shown significant reduction in the extent of vessel outgrowth. Evidence supports the use of anti-VEGF antibodies, such as bevacizumab or <b>pegaptanib,</b> seems to improve outcomes when used in conjunction with laser therapy to treat retinopathy of prematurity. The evidence is poorer for treatment of diabetic retinopathy. Use of anti-VEGF drugs did not appear to improve outcomes when compared to standard laser therapy for diabetic retinopathy.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{report the}} {{outcomes}} after primary intravitreal <b>pegaptanib</b> sodium {{in patients with}} diabetic macular edema (DME). Methods.

40|$|AIMS: To {{assess the}} {{clinical}} effectiveness of <b>pegaptanib</b> sodium and ranibizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). METHODS: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) identified through searching 12 electronic databases, bibliographies and consultation with experts and manufacturers. RCTs were eligible if they assessed {{the effects of}} <b>pegaptanib</b> or ranibizumab with best supportive care, sham injection or photodynamic therapy (PDT) on patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation associated with wet AMD and examined outcomes including visual acuity and adverse events. RESULTS: Three RCTs of ranibizumab (MARINA, ANCHOR, FOCUS) and two of <b>pegaptanib</b> (VISION study) met the inclusion criteria. The RCTs included patients with different lesion types. The studies showed statistically significant benefit on different measures of visual acuity for patients receiving <b>pegaptanib,</b> ranibizumab or ranibizumab with PDT compared to control (sham injection, PDT or sham injection with PDT) after 12 months. These differences appeared to be clinically significant. Although adverse events were common among those receiving <b>pegaptanib</b> or ranibizumab, they were considered mild to moderate in nature. Meta-analysis of ranibizumab trials and indirect comparison of the two drugs were not possible {{due to differences in}} the study populations' lesion types. However, results from the RCTs of ranibizumab tended to show a greater effect on visual acuity than results from the RCT of <b>pegaptanib.</b> CONCLUSIONS: <b>Pegaptanib</b> and ranibizumab appear to slow or stop the progression of neovascular AMD. Uncertainty remains over the relative benefits of <b>pegaptanib</b> compared with ranibizumab and other unlicensed drugs (eg, Avastin), {{due to the nature of}} the evidence.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the combined treatment of photodynamic therapy and specific VEGF 165 inhibition with <b>pegaptanib</b> sodium (Macugen; Eyetech Pharmaceuticals, Lexington, MA) on ocular neovascularization. METHODS: Photodynamic therapy's (PDT's) effects on the integrity of <b>pegaptanib</b> sodium were analyzed by HPLC, a VEGF 165 -binding assay, and a VEGF 165 -induced tissue factor gene expression assay. The effects of mono- or combined treatment on vessel growth and regression were determined in a murine corneal neovascularization model. The effects of combined treatment on vessel growth were also determined in a murine choroidal neovascularization model. RESULTS: PDT did not affect the chemical composition of <b>pegaptanib</b> sodium nor the efficacy of <b>pegaptanib</b> sodium in the inhibition of VEGF 165 binding to Flt- 1 and VEGF 165 -induced gene expression. In an animal model of effects on existing ocular neovascular lesions (corneal neovascularization), PDT monotherapy yielded an initial regression of these vessels, but there followed a rapid regrowth. In contrast, <b>pegaptanib</b> sodium monotherapy yielded little regression but potently abrogated further vessel growth. The combination of <b>pegaptanib</b> sodium and PDT resulted in the regression of the neovascular lesions, as observed with PDT alone, but also prevented significant vessel regrowth, leading to a significantly greater reduction in lesion size than did each monotherapy. In addition, there was a significantly greater effect of the combination of <b>pegaptanib</b> sodium and PDT on lesion size in choroidal neovascularization than with each monotherapy. Pretreatment with <b>pegaptanib</b> sodium appeared to decrease the efficacy of PDT-induced vessel regression in corneal neovascularization, and as such the enhanced efficacy over monotherapy when the agents were delivered simultaneously was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Although the combined simultaneous treatment of ocular neovascularization with PDT and <b>pegaptanib</b> sodium may provide a more effective approach for the regression and overall treatment of CNV associated with AMD, the order of addition of these treatments {{may play a role in}} achieving optimal efficacy...|$|E

DESIGN: Two concurrent, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled studies (V. I. S. I. O. N. [Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Inhibition Study in Ocular Neovascularization] trials). PARTICIPANTS: Patients with all angiographic neovascular lesion compositions of AMD were enrolled. In combined analyses, 88 % (1053 / 1190) were re-randomized at week 54, and 89 % (941 / 1053) were assessed at week 102. INTERVENTIONS: At week 54, those initially assigned to <b>pegaptanib</b> were re-randomized (1 : 1) to continue or discontinue therapy for 48 more weeks (8 injections). Those initially assigned to sham were re-randomized to continue sham, discontinue sham, or receive 1 of 3 <b>pegaptanib</b> doses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean change in visual acuity (VA) over time and mean change in the standardized area under the curve of VA and proportions of patients experiencing a loss of > or = 15 letters from week 54 to week 102; losing or = 0, > or = 1, > or = 2, and > or = 3 lines of VA; and progressing to legal blindness (20 / 200 or worse).

DESIGN: Randomized (1 : 1), sham-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group trial. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects with DME. INTERVENTION: Subjects received <b>pegaptanib</b> 0. 3 mg or sham injections every 6 weeks in year 1 (total = 9 injections) and could receive focal/grid photocoagulation beginning at week 18. During year 2, subjects received injections as often as every 6 weeks per prespecified criteria. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion gaining >/= 10 letters of visual acuity (VA) from baseline to year 1. Safety was monitored throughout. RESULTS: In all, 260 (<b>pegaptanib,</b> n = 133; sham, n = 127) and 207 (<b>pegaptanib,</b> n = 107; sham, n = 100) subjects were included in years 1 and 2 intent-to-treat analyses, respectively. A total of 49 of the 133 (36. 8 %) subjects from the <b>pegaptanib</b> group and 25 of the 127 (19. 7 %) from the sham group experienced a VA improvement of >/= 10 letters at week 54 compared with baseline (odds ratio [OR], 2. 38; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 32 - 4. 30; P = 0. 0047). For pegaptanib-treated subjects, change in mean VA from baseline by visit was superior (P< 0. 05) to sham at weeks 6, 24, 30, 36, 42, 54, 78, 84, 90, 96, and 102. At week 102, pegaptanib-treated subjects gained, on average, 6. 1 letters versus 1. 3 letters for sham (P< 0. 01). Fewer pegaptanib- than sham-treated subjects received focal/grid laser treatment (week 54, 31 / 133 [23. 3 %] vs 53 / 127 [41. 7 %], respectively, P = 0. 002; week 102, 27 / 107 [25. 2 %] vs 45 / 100 [45. 0 %], respectively, P = 0. 003). The <b>pegaptanib</b> treatment group showed significantly better results on the National Eye Institute-Visual Functioning Questionnaire than sham for subscales important in this population. <b>Pegaptanib</b> was well tolerated; the frequencies of discontinuations, adverse events, treatment-related adverse events, and serious adverse events were comparable in the <b>pegaptanib</b> and sham groups.

Those initially assigned to <b>pegaptanib</b> were re-randomized (1 : 1) to continue or discontinue therapy for 48 more weeks; sham-treated patients were re-randomized (1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1) to continue sham, discontinue, or receive one of the <b>pegaptanib</b> doses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All reported adverse events, serious adverse events, and deaths. PARTICIPANTS: In year 1, 1190 subjects received at least one study treatment (0. 3 mg, n = 295; 1 mg, n = 301; 3 mg, n = 296; sham, n = 298); 7545 intravitreous injections of <b>pegaptanib</b> were administered. In year 2, 425 subjects (0. 3 mg, n = 128; 1 mg, n = 126; 3 mg, n = 120; sham, n = 51) continued the same masked treatment as in year 1 and received at least one study treatment in year 2; 2663 intravitreous injections of <b>pegaptanib</b> were administered in these subjects. RESULTS: All doses of <b>pegaptanib</b> were well tolerated. The most common ocular adverse events were transient, mild to moderate in intensity, and attributed to the injection preparation and procedure. There was no evidence of an increase in deaths, in events associated with systemic VEGF inhibition (e. g., hypertension, thromboembolic events, serious hemorrhagic events), or in severe ocular inflammation, cataract progression, or glaucoma in pegaptanib-treated patients relative to sham-treated patients. In year 1, serious injection-related complications included endophthalmitis (12 events, 0. 16 %/injection), retinal detachment (RD) (6 events [4 rhegmatogenous, 2 exudative], 0. 08 %/injection), and traumatic cataract (5 events, 0. 07 %/injection). Most cases of endophthalmitis followed violations of the injection preparation protocol. In patients receiving <b>pegaptanib</b> for > 1 year, there were no reports of endophthalmitis or traumatic cataract in year 2; RD was reported in 4 patients (all rhegmatogenous, 0. 15 %/injection).

This selective inhibition prevents binding to the VEGF receptors and the development of the increased vascular permeability and the CNV associated with neovascular age-related degeneration (AMD). The VEGF Inhibition Study In Ocular Neovascularization (VISION) demonstrated that <b>pegaptanib</b> sodium confers clinically meaningful benefit in the treatment of all angiographic subtypes of neovascular AMD. It also has a favorable safety profile after 1 and 2 years of continuous treatment, and recent data suggest that the agent has a disease-modifying effect. Post hoc analysis of VISION suggests that treatment benefit may be greatest in patients with early lesions, in whom 80 % achieved the primary endpoint of � 15 letters lost, 47 % maintained visual acuity (VA), and 20 % gained � 15 letters of vision. Similarly, our own clinical experience indicates that <b>pegaptanib</b> sodium achieves better outcomes in early lesions than in established lesions, particularly in patients with previously untreated minimally classic and occult lesions in whom VA improvement and lesion size stabilization has been recorded. Observations indicate that <b>pegaptanib</b> sodium has a slower mode of action than unselective VEGF inhibitors, resulting in an average of 3 – 4 injections being required to stabilize VA and lesion size. <b>Pegaptanib</b> sodium has good efficacy and safety profiles and represents a good treatment option for patients with early CNV membranes associated with neovascular AMD.

Elevated levels of the VEGF 165 isoform lead to the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), the growth of fragile, new vessels in the macula that may cause exudation, and hemorrhages. <b>Pegaptanib</b> sodium (Macugen ®, [OSI] Eyetech Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer) blocks the extracellular VEG...|$|E
