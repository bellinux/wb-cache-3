5|$|In {{the hope}} of gaining access to the {{state-of-the-art}} resources of Caltech for their rocketry research, Parsons and Forman attended a lecture {{on the work of}} Austrian rocket engineer Eugen Sänger and hypothetical above-stratospheric aircraft by the institute's William Bollay— a <b>PhD</b> <b>student</b> specializing in rocket-powered aircraft—and approached him to express their interest in designing a liquid-fuel rocket motor. Bollay redirected them to another <b>PhD</b> <b>student</b> named Frank Malina, a mathematician and mechanical engineer composing a thesis on rocket propulsion who shared their interests and soon befriended the pair. Parsons, Forman, and Malina applied for funding from Caltech together; they did not mention that their ultimate objective was to develop rockets for space exploration, realizing that most of the scientific establishment then relegated such ideas to science fiction. While Caltech's Clark Blanchard Millikan immediately rebuffed them, Malina's doctoral advisor Theodore von Kármán saw more promise in their proposal and agreed to allow them to operate {{under the auspices of the}} university's Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory (GALCIT). Naming themselves the GALCIT Rocket Research Group, they gained access to Caltech's specialist equipment, though the economics of the Great Depression left von Kármán unable to finance them.|$|E

He looked at the nuclear charge of platinum, silver, and copper, and experimentally found {{that this was the}} same as the atomic number within an error of less than 1.5 per cent. In April 1919, Rutherford became director of the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, and Chadwick joined him there a few months later. Chadwick was awarded a Clerk-Maxwell studentship in 1920, and enrolled as a Doctor of Philosophy (<b>PhD)</b> <b>student</b> at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. The first half of his thesis was his work with atomic numbers. In the second, he looked at the forces inside the nucleus. His degree was awarded in June 1921.

5|$|Several {{volcanic}} {{features in}} the Mount Cayley field were illustrated by volcanologist Jack Souther in 1980, including Mount Cayley, Cauldron Dome, Slag Hill, Mount Fee, Ember Ridge and Ring Mountain, which was titled Crucible Dome at the time. This resulted {{in the creation of}} a geologic map that showed the regional terrain and locations of the volcanoes. The most detailed study of Mount Cayley took place during this period. Little Ring Mountain at the northernmost end of the field had not been studied at the time and was not included on Souther's 1980 map. Ember Ridge at the southern end of the field was originally mapped as a cluster of five lava domes. The sixth lava dome, Ember Ridge Northeast, was discovered by <b>Ph.D.</b> <b>student</b> Melanie Kelman during a period of research in 2001.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Chadwick {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} become the Master of Gonville and Caius College. The job was prestigious but ill-defined; the Master was the titular head of the College, but authority actually resided in a council of 13 fellows, of whom one was the Master. As Master, Chadwick strove to improve the academic reputation of the college. He {{increased the number of}} research fellowships from 31 to 49, and sought to bring talent into the college. This involved controversial decisions, such as hiring in 1951 the Chinese biochemist Tien-chin Tsao and the Hungarian-born economist Peter Bauer. In {{what became known as the}} Peasants' Revolt, fellows led by Patrick Hadley voted an old friend of Chadwick's off the council and replaced him with Bauer. More friends of Chadwick's were removed over the following years, and he retired in November 1958. It was during his mastership that Francis Crick, a <b>PhD</b> <b>student</b> at Gonville and Caius College, and James Watson discovered the structure of DNA.|$|E

40|$|Background: A good {{interpersonal}} {{relationship between a}} <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>student</b> and his/her supervisor is crucial {{for the success of}} a Ph. D. project and could be expected to have an important impact on the well-being of the <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>student.</b> Moreover, {{it is not clear whether}} the supervisor-student relationship has a different effect on the well-being of male and female <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>students.</b> Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the mentoring style of the Ph. D. supervisor influences the well-being of male and female <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>students</b> differently by taking into account students’ perceived psychosocial work conditions (Karasek, 1979) as possible mediating factors. Method: The present study is based on data collected using the Survey of Junior Researchers from 952 male and 928 female <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>students</b> in 4 Flemish universities. The mentoring style was assessed using two scales, measuring how strongly <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>students</b> perceived their supervisor to be authoritative and supportive. Three measures of psychosocial well-being were included: job satisfaction, pleasure at work and need for recovery. Structural equation modelling was applied for men and women separately to explore the underlying structure of the relationships among mentoring style, psychosocial work conditions and well-being. Results: Our results indicated that for both men and women the relation between mentoring style and well-being was partially mediated by Ph. D. students’ psychosocial work conditions such as perceived job demands, control and social support from co-workers and supervisor. For both male and female <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>students,</b> results showed that the more they perceived their supervisor as supportive, the higher their social support from colleagues and supervisor, job control and job satisfaction. In contrast, the more they perceived their supervisor as authoritative, the higher their job demands and the lower co-worker support, job control and pleasure at work. Women reported lower supervisor support when they perceived their supervisor as authoritative. A highly authoritative mentoring style was only positively related with need for recovery after work among male students. The effects of the psychosocial work conditions on student well-being were comparable for male and female students. Conclusion: These findings suggest that Ph. D. supervisors should become aware of how their mentoring style may influence Ph. D. students’ perception of psychosocial work conditions and well-being. A supportive mentoring style positively influences student well-being, while an authoritative mentoring style has a negative effect on well-being, especially among male <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>students...</b>|$|R
