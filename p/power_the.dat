For the insurgent, these dynamics—the power of rising expectations, <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of <b>the</b> people, <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of <b>the</b> underdog, <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of agility, <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of resistance, <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of security, and <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of belonging—become <b>the</b> pillars of small war <b>power.</b> For <b>the</b> counterinsurgent, each of these pillars presents both a potential hazard and an exploitable vulnerability...|$|R
5|$|Abd al-Rahman at {{this time}} was a {{flamboyant}} figure with broad popular support. His stature served to diminish that of the politicians, who were seen as his followers rather than as leaders. Abd al-Rahman could not afford a sudden British withdrawal, since that would {{open the door for}} an Egyptian take-over and the loss of his <b>power.</b> <b>The</b> British also were against an Egyptian take-over, but for different reasons. Yet Abd al-Rahman could not be seen as supporting an indefinite colonial status, and continued to promote independence. Abd al-Rahman and the British were engaged in delicate and unstable arrangements characterized by mutual distrust.|$|E
5|$|After the Nazis came to <b>power,</b> <b>the</b> {{design was}} given priority. Despite initial {{competition}} from the Henschel Hs 123, the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM, the German aviation ministry) turned to the designs of Herman Pohlmann of Junkers and co-designer of the K 47, Karl Plauth. During the trials with the K 47 in 1932, the double vertical stabilizers were introduced to give the rear gunner a better field of fire. The main, and {{what was to be}} the most distinctive, feature of the Ju 87 was its double-spar inverted gull wings.|$|E
5|$|After the Nazis seized <b>power</b> <b>the</b> {{family moved}} first to Möhlstrasse in Munich, and in 1934 to Lake Tegern, where {{they bought a}} house.

The relationship was strained. The couple did unite for social functions; they were frequent guests at the Heydrich home. Margarete saw it as her duty to invite the wives of the senior SS leaders over for afternoon coffee and tea on Wednesday afternoons.|$|E

5|$|After the Romanian Communist Party seized {{political}} <b>power,</b> <b>the</b> sovietization of {{the army}} commenced, {{under the supervision of}} the new Minister of Defence, Emil Bodnăraş. Thirty per cent of the officers and noncommissioned officers (mostly experienced soldiers, and a potential source of opposition) were purged from the military. This involved copying the Soviet model of military and political organisation, and changing the military doctrine of combat and defence, also in the context of Romania's integration in the strategic system of the Soviets, at the beginning of the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Al-Mu'azzam Turan-Shah alienated the Mamluks {{soon after}} their victory at Mansurah and {{constantly}} threatened them and Shajar al-Durr.
