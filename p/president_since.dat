5|$|After the crisis, superpower {{relations}} improved, as Kennedy gave a conciliatory {{speech at}} American University on 10 June 1963, recognizing the Soviet people's suffering during World War II, and paying tribute to their achievements. Khrushchev called the speech the best by a U.S. <b>president</b> <b>since</b> Franklin Roosevelt, and, in July, negotiated a {{test ban treaty}} with U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman and with Lord Hailsham of the United Kingdom. Plans for a second Khrushchev-Kennedy summit were dashed by the U.S. President's assassination in November 1963. The new U.S. President, Lyndon Johnson, hoped for continued improved relations but was distracted by other issues and had little opportunity to develop a relationship with Khrushchev before the premier was ousted.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{continuing}} debate surrounding his legacy, many conservative and liberal scholars agree that Reagan {{has been the}} most influential <b>president</b> <b>since</b> Franklin D.

J. Heale, who finds that scholars now concur that Reagan rehabilitated conservatism, turned the nation to the right, practiced a considerably pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics, revived faith in the presidency and in American exceptionalism, and contributed to victory in the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|The {{issue was}} one of the last major issues to be resolved, and was done so in the electoral college. At the time, before the {{formation}} of modern political parties, there was widespread concern that candidates would routinely fail to secure a majority of electors in the electoral college. The method of resolving this problem therefore was a contested issue. Most thought that the house should then choose the <b>president,</b> <b>since</b> it most closely reflected the will of the people. This caused dissension among delegates from smaller states, who realized that this would put their states at a disadvantage. To resolve this dispute, the Convention agreed that the house would elect the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, but that each state delegation would vote as a bloc, rather than individually.|$|E
5|$|Walt Disney Animation Studios is {{currently}} managed by Edwin Catmull (President, Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios), John Lasseter (Chief Creative Officer) and Andrew Millstein (<b>President).</b> <b>Since</b> 2006, {{while continuing to}} live in the San Francisco Bay Area (where they manage Pixar), Catmull and Lasseter have regularly commuted to Burbank every week to spend at least two days (usually Tuesdays and Wednesdays) at Disney Animation. They initially appointed Millstein as general manager and executive vice president to handle day-to-day business operations on their behalf. Millstein was promoted to the title of president in November 2014, along with his counterpart at Pixar, general manager Jim Morris. Both Millstein and Morris continue to report to Catmull, who retains the title of president of both studios.|$|E
5|$|Agnew's pride {{had been}} stung by the {{negative}} {{news coverage of}} him during the campaign, and he sought to bolster his reputation by assiduous performance of his duties. It had become usual {{for the vice president}} to preside over the Senate only if he might be needed to break a tie, but Agnew opened every session for the first two months of his term, and spent more time presiding, in his first year, than any vice <b>president</b> <b>since</b> Alben Barkley, who held that role under Harry S. Truman. The first postwar vice president not to have been a senator, he took lessons in Senate procedures from the parliamentarian and from a Republican committee staffer. He lunched with small groups of senators, and was initially successful in building good relations. Although silenced on foreign policy matters, he attended White House staff meetings and spoke on urban affairs; when Nixon was present, he often presented the perspective of the governors. Agnew earned praise from the other members when he presided over a meeting of the White House Domestic Council in Nixon's absence but, like Nixon during Eisenhower's illnesses, did not sit in the president's chair. Nevertheless, many of the commission assignments Nixon gave Agnew were sinecures, with the vice president only formally the head.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in January 2009, Rajoelina led {{a series}} of {{political}} rallies in downtown Antananarivo where he gave voice to the frustration that Ravalomanana's policies had triggered, particularly among the economically marginalized {{and members of the}} political opposition. On 3 February, Ravalomanana dismissed Rajoelina as mayor of Antananarivo and appointed a special delegation headed by Guy Randrianarisoa to manage the affairs of the capital. Rajoelina incited demonstrators on 7 February to occupy the president's office in Ambohitsorohitra Palace in central Antananarivo. The presidential guard opened fire on the advancing crowd, killing 31 and wounding more than 200. Ravalomanana became the third <b>president</b> <b>since</b> independence (after Ratsiraka and Philibert Tsiranana) to allow the defense forces to shoot at civilians; several months later, at a demonstration led by Ravalomanana supporters, Rajoelina would become the fourth president to authorize such an action. Popular disapproval of Ravalomanana intensified and polarized some in favor of his resignation, although perceptions of Rajoelina as an alternative remained mixed. Conflicts between pro-Rajoelina demonstrators and security forces continued over the following weeks, resulting in several additional deaths.|$|E
5|$|In March 1981, {{widespread}} violence {{took place}} in Bangui following elections, after Operation Caban led the French to drop Bokassa (who had begun to call himself Emperor Bokassa I), and replaced him with David Dacko. Opponents of the President met in Bangui and were forced to flee the country. After returning voluntarily to Bangui {{in the autumn of}} 1986, Bokassa went on trial. Initially faced with the death penalty, in February 1988 he was instead sentenced to life imprisonment. His successor was General André Kolingba, army chief of staff of Decko’s army, who took over control from the local French military on 1 September 1981 under the pretext that the country was heading towards civil war. Although he attempted to combat corruption and control the national economy, he was unable to achieve his reforms. By the middle of the 1980s the country’s economic situation had deteriorated as 80% of the revenue went towards meeting the salaries of the staff. Under pressure from France and other western countries, Kolingba restored democracy in the country in 1991 with a multiparty government but elections could be held only three years later in August 1994. During the elections, Ange-Félix Patassé was elected to the post of <b>president.</b> <b>Since</b> he was from northern CAR, the southern group of Kolingba started a rebellion during 1996.|$|E
5|$|Jesse Sage, {{associate}} director of the American Anti-slavery Group, and Jacobs persuaded Bok to move to Boston to work with the AASG. He was initially hesitant to leave his new friends in Ames, but according to Bok, the people at AASG were persistent. He arrived in Boston on May 14, 2000, AASG helped him find an apartment. A week after moving to Boston, he was invited to speak at a Baptist church in Roxbury and was interviewed by Charles A. Radin of The Boston Globe. Two days after his speech in Roxbury, Bok was asked to meet with supporters of AASG {{on the steps of the}} United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. He returned to Washington on September 28, 2000, and became the first escaped slave to speak before the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Francis was invited to Washington again in 2002 for the signing of the Sudan Peace Act and met with President George W. Bush. It was during this trip to the White House that Bok became the first former slave to meet with a U.S. <b>President</b> <b>since</b> the 19th century.|$|E
