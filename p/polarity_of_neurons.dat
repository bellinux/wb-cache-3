40|$|SummarySecreted {{proteins}} of the Wnt family affect axon guidance, asymmetric cell division, {{and cell}} fate. We show here that C. elegans Wnts acting through Frizzled receptors can shape axon and dendrite trajectories by reversing the anterior-posterior <b>polarity</b> <b>of</b> <b>neurons.</b> In lin- 44 /Wnt and lin- 17 /Frizzled mutants, the polarity of the PLM mechanosensory neuron is reversed along the body axis: the long PLM process, PLM growth cone, and synapses are posterior to its cell body instead of anterior. Similarly, the polarity of the ALM mechanosensory neuron is reversed in cwn- 1 egl- 20 Wnt double mutants, suggesting that different Wnt signals regulate neuronal polarity at different anterior-posterior positions. LIN- 17 protein is asymmetrically localized to the posterior process of PLM in a lin- 44 -dependent manner, indicating that Wnt signaling redistributes LIN- 17 in PLM. In this context, Wnts appear to function not as instructive growth cone attractants or repellents, but as organizers of neuronal polarity...|$|E
40|$|The {{projections}} of different subpopulations of myenteric neurons in the mouse {{small and large}} intestine were examined by combining immunohistological techniques with myotomy and myectomy operations. The myotomies were {{used to examine the}} <b>polarity</b> <b>of</b> <b>neurons</b> projecting within the myenteric plexus and showed that neurons containing immunoreactivity for nitric oxide synthase (NOS), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), calbindin and 5 -HT projected anally, while neurons with substance P (SP) -immunoreactivity projected orally, in both the small and large intestine. Neurons containing neuropeptide Y (NPY) - and calretinin-immunoreactivity projected locally. In the large intestine, GABA-immunoreactive neurons projected both orally and anally, with more axons tending to project anally. Myectomy operations revealed that circular muscle motor neurons containing NOS/VIP/±NPY and calretinin neurons projected anally both in the small and large intestine, while SP-immunoreactive circular muscle motor neurons projected orally. In the large intestine, GABA-IR circular muscle motor neurons projected both orally and anally. This study showed that although some neurons, such as the NOS/VP inhibitory motor neurons and interneurons, SP excitatory motor neurons and 5 -HT interneurons had similar projections to those in other species, the {{projections of}} other chemical classes of neurons in the mouse intestine differed from those reported in other species...|$|E

Single-cell axotomy <b>of</b> dissociated <b>neurons</b> enables the study of the intrinsic regenerative capacities of injured axons. This protocol describes how to perform single-cell axotomy on dissociated hippocampal neurons containing synapses. Furthermore, to axotomize hippocampal neurons integrated in neuronal circuits, we describe how to set up coculture with a few fluorescently labeled neurons. This approach allows axotomy of single cells in a complex neuronal network and the observation of morphological and molecular changes during axon regeneration.

40|$|International audienceThe axon initial segment (AIS) plays a {{key role}} in {{maintaining}} the molecular and functional <b>polarity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>neuron.</b> The relationship between the AIS architecture and the microtubules (MTs) supporting axonal transport is unknown. Here we provide evidence that the MT plus-end-binding (EB) proteins EB 1 and EB 3 have a role in the AIS in addition to their MT plus-end tracking protein behavior in other neuronal compartments. In mature neurons, EB 3 is concentrated and stabilized in the AIS. We identified a direct interaction between EB 3 /EB 1 and the AIS scaffold protein ankyrin G (ankG). In addition, EB 3 and EB 1 participate in AIS maintenance, and AIS disassembly through ankG knockdown leads to cell-wide up-regulation of EB 3 and EB 1 comets. Thus, EB 3 and EB 1 coordinate a molecular and functional interplay between ankG and the AIS MTs that supports the central role of ankG in the maintenance <b>of</b> neuronal <b>polarity...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{plasmalemma}} {{of mature}} and growing olfactory axons of the bullfrog {{has been studied}} by freeze-fracture. Intramembrane particles (IMPs) of mature olfactory axons {{are found to be}} uniformly distributed along the shaft. However, during growth, a decreasing gradient of IMP density is evident along the somatofugal axis. The size histograms of axolemmal IMPs from different segments of growing nerve reveal regional differences in the particle composition. The distribution of each individual size class of particles along the growing nerve forms a decreasing gradient in the somatofugal direction; the slope of these gradients varies directly with particle diameter. These size-dependent density gradients are consistent with a process of lateral diffusion of membrane components that are inserted proximally into the plasma membrane. The membrane composition of the growth cone, however, appears to be independent of these diffusion gradients; it displays a mosaic pattern of discrete domains of high and low particle densities. The relative IMP profiles of these growth cone regions are similar to one another but contain higher densities of large IMPs than the neighboring axonal shaft. The shifting distributions of intramembrane particles that characterize the sprouting neuron give new insights into cellular processes that may underlie the establishment <b>of</b> the functional <b>polarity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>neuron</b> and into the dynamics of axolemmal maturation...|$|R
40|$|The command interneuron circuit for Caenorhabditis Elegans {{locomotion}} {{has been}} {{known for a long time}} [1, 2]. However, synaptic <b>polarities</b> <b>of</b> these interneurons, and thus, the circuit functioning is largely unknown. Additionally, nematode command neurons express both glutamate-gated chloride channels and glutamate-gated cation channels, which causes that each synapse, even when belonging to the same neuron, might be either inhibitory or excitatory. We use an experimental behavioral data set: eighteen different neural ablations were performed and times spent in the forward and reverse motions were registered. Therefore one can consider eighteen different command neuron network structures where each one as a whole, controls the behavior of the nematode, and results with one of the eighteen different behavioral patterns. In order to decipher the particular <b>polarities</b> <b>of</b> each <b>neuron</b> we have constructed a theoretical (inter) neuron network model, in which neural activities are represented by a set of differential equations and searched all possible synaptic polarity combinations in the circuit to find the best match to the timing data [3, 4]. Here, we present the extension of this model, where we explicitly incorporate calcium concentration dynamics as the regulatory factor and detailed connectivity diagram based on the transmission type of each synapse. Since the parameter space spanned by the morphological and regulatory factors is huge, we have applied an evolutionary strategy for finding the parameters of the mathematical model, for which the theoretical results and the experimental data fit the best. The overall model output consists of the averaged values: neuron activities, calcium concentration levels, input signal (the upstream neurons activity pattern) and of the resolved detailed connectivity diagram. The deciphered list of the types of synapses states that most of the synapses, including strongest connections, e. g. ASH -> “backward” motoneurons, PVC -> “forward” motoneurons, AVD -> AVA, in the command neuron circuit are inhibitory. <br/...|$|R
5000|$|CRMP-2 {{plays a role}} in {{neuronal}} <b>polarity.</b> Extensions <b>of</b> early <b>neurons</b> called lamellipodia {{form the}} early neurites. The neurites are indistinguishable between dendrites and the axon during this stage. One of these neurites eventually becomes the axon and grows longer than the dendritic neurites. CRMP-2 helps facilitate the rate of this axonal growth through its interactions with microtubules. [...] CRMP-2 binds to and copolymerizes with tubulin heterodimers but does not bind as well to polymerized tubulin. This binding specificity promotes tubulin polymerization in vitro. CRMP-2/tubulin complexes are found in the distal part of the axon and modulate microtubule dynamics by controlling the rate of microtubule assembly. CRMP-2 also contributes to the establishment <b>of</b> neuronal <b>polarity</b> by regulating polarized Numb-mediated endocytosis at the axonal growth cones. In both cases, phosphorylation of CRMP-2 at Thr-555 by Rho kinase or at Thr-509, Thr-514 or Ser-518 by GSK-3β inactivates the protein by lowering binding affinity to tubulin and Numb.|$|R
40|$|C. elegans is {{the only}} animal for which a {{detailed}} neural connectivity diagram has been constructed. However, synaptic polarities in this diagram, and thus, circuit functions are largely unknown. Here, we deciphered the likely <b>polarities</b> <b>of</b> 7 pre-motor <b>neurons</b> implicated in the control of worm&# 39;s locomotion, {{using a combination of}} experimental and computational tools. We performed single and multiple laser ablations in the locomotor interneuron circuit and recorded times the worms spent in forward and backward locomotion. We constructed a theoretical model of the locomotor circuit and searched its all possible synaptic polarity combinations and sensory input patterns in order to find the best match to the timing data. The optimal solution is when either all or most of the interneurons are inhibitory and forward interneurons receive the strongest input, which suggests that inhibition governs the dynamics of the locomotor interneuron circuit. From the five pre-motor interneurons, only AVB and AVD are equally likely to be excitatory, i. e. they have probably similar number of inhibitory and excitatory connections to distant targets. The method used here has a general character and thus can be also applied to other neural systems consisting of small functional networks...|$|R

Axon regeneration at the dendritic tip thus triggered the disappearance of minus end-distal microtubules from dendrites.
