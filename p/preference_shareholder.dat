50|$|This {{appeared}} to be satisfactory, but it emerged in 1867 that the <b>preference</b> <b>shareholders</b> had not been agreed by the <b>preference</b> <b>shareholders,</b> and the amalgamation was held to be void. An Act of 1868 confirmed {{the separation of the}} two companies once again and the HH&BR was reincorporated by Act of 26 July 1869. It needed a company to work its trains for it, and after a false start the Midland Railway performed this task, from 1 October 1869. The Midland Railway had a presence at Hereford using running powers, and had long sought an entry into South Wales.|$|R
50|$|Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd was nationalised {{under the}} Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946. The company’s assets were {{transferred}} to the National Coal Board, and the company was waiting for reimbursement. In advance of liquidation the company procured a special resolution for reduction of capital, whereby all paid up capital would be returned to <b>preference</b> <b>shareholders,</b> to settle any claims. The aim was to eliminate them from the company, so ordinary shareholders could get excesses from compulsory purchase compensation. The <b>preference</b> <b>shareholders,</b> including Scottish Insurance Corp Ltd complained {{that they should be}} able to share in the proceeds from liquidated assets.|$|R

40|$|Since late 2012 the Chinese {{government}} has been endeavouring to reintroduce preference shares. This article studies the revival of preference shares in China and its strengths and dangers as a viable investment/financing tool. Its main strength is to help Chinese banks meet new capital adequacy requirements and to stimulate the stagnant stock market, and its core danger is its potential misuse by dominant shareholders to expropriate profits from minority common shareholders {{in the context of}} weak minority shareholder protection and insufficient cash dividends in the Chinese stock market. Empirical evidence gives partial support to this understanding of its danger because the impact of preference shares on existing common shareholders is mixed and differs among different types of companies. This article also shows that the current regulatory regime in China provides comprehensive protection for <b>preference</b> <b>shareholders</b> and that compared with minority common <b>shareholders,</b> <b>preference</b> <b>shareholders</b> are in an advantageous position. ...|$|R

50|$|An underperforming {{local line}} worked by a larger {{sponsoring}} company could only end with absorption, {{and by the}} terms of a G&SWR Amalgamation Act of 5 July 1865, the Maybole and Girvan Railway was absorbed by the larger company. the 4% <b>preference</b> <b>shareholders</b> got 4% <b>preference</b> shares in the G&SWR, but the ordinary shareholders only got £35 per cent.

40|$|In economies {{with private}} firm ownership, when markets are incomplete, and firm sharehold-ers change over time, {{there is no}} broad {{agreement}} on {{what ought to be}} a firm’s objective. It is shown that ex-post, profit maximization is consistent with <b>shareholder</b> <b>preferences</b> in such economies; that is, along the equilibrium path, in every period and state of the world, every coalition of a firm’s shareholders in that period and state approves a profit-maximizing pro-duction plan. This result is shown using natural assumptions about <b>shareholder</b> <b>preferences</b> and <b>shareholder</b> control, and it applies to cases when shareholders within a firm and across firms can form coalitions, and when stock trading can be ex-dividend or cum-dividend, and with a combination of both. This result provides a natural and familiar basis for formulating a theory of the firm when markets are incomplete; a theory based on primitives of share-holder <b>preferences</b> and <b>shareholder</b> control that are to be necessarily satisfied in economies with private firm ownership. ...|$|R
50|$|In fact {{it emerged}} in 1867 that the {{amalgamation}} agreement was not been {{ratified by the}} Brecon and Merthyr <b>preference</b> <b>shareholders,</b> and in the Court of Chancery the amalgamation was declared void. The combined company now had to separate; this too required an authorising Act, the Brecon & Merthyr Railway (Agreement) Act of 13 July 1868. By now the financial slump in the country had resulted in the combined company having been unable to meet debenture interest, so that the HH&BR resumed its independent existence {{in the hands of}} a receiver.|$|R
50|$|In 1883 the Directors had {{to inform}} a shareholders' meeting that {{debentures}} falling due shortly {{could not be}} discharged. The combined company was not commercially successful, and went into administration. A scheme of arrangement with its creditors was agreed in 1885, but the line continued in difficult financial circumstances. The apportionment of income and costs between the Bridge section and the Forest (S&WR) section of the combined company, and between debenture holders and ordinary and <b>preference</b> <b>shareholders</b> {{continued to be a}} source of antagonism. In addition much expenditure was necessary in modernising the S&WR section infrastructure, and in dredging at Lydney. In addition the Forest collieries and iron workings were constantly uncompetitive, and as the railway was wholly dependent on the success or failure of those industries, decline was unstoppable.|$|R
50|$|Passenger {{operation}} {{had been}} authorised and the preparations made for opening from Swansea to Pontardawe for passengers. Captain Ross of the Board of Trade visited the line {{but he found}} deficiencies, and declined to permit passenger running. Improvements were made and when Colonel Rich of the Board of Trade made a follow-up visit on 20 February 1860 he was satisfied, and passenger trains started running the following day, 21 February 1860. The passenger business was buoyant and further third class carriages had to be acquired. Receipts for the half year to August 1860 were £4,912 compared with the previous £3,693, and operating expenses were now £1,740, and rent and rates £683. In later years the practice was usually that the <b>preference</b> <b>shareholders</b> were paid their full dividend but that ordinary shareholders got nothing.|$|R
50|$|In early 1924 S T D Motors went to {{the public}} to borrow funds amounting to around 15 per cent of its fully paid capital. No purpose for the {{borrowing}} was published but it {{is believed to have}} been to fund Coatalen's ambitions for the group's racing cars. Increased profits did not materialise and within five years the group's financial reserves were exhausted and plant and machinery was becoming obsolete and the group's products were becoming outmoded. After certain undertakings were made to their bankers the company's <b>preference</b> <b>shareholders</b> received their 1925-1926 dividend — in 1929. The financial problems of the 1920s were thought to have been ended by a court-sanctioned financial reconstruction in June 1930. At that time the substantial accumulated losses were recognised and the ordinary capital chopped down to one-third of its value. Financial commentators could see that the only assets were shares in or loans to other companies making evaluation difficult.|$|R
50|$|When the IoWCR {{agreed to}} work the Newport, Godshill and St Lawrence Railway, it {{guaranteed}} a minimum income of £2,000 to that company's shareholders. It anticipated that ordinary income would pay that sum off but the poor custom on the line failed to achieve that. The IoWCR <b>preference</b> <b>shareholders</b> were not getting dividends—the ordinary shareholders had no hope of that—and there was shareholder criticism of the payments. At the shareholders' meeting of 1 March 1911 the issue {{came to a head}} and several directors resigned, and new directors were installed. One of the new men was Harry Willmott, who had long experience as a senior railway manager, including much in reviving the fortunes of the impecunious Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway. He was installed as the new chairman, and he soon brought in new managers and introduced more streamlined systems in the company. Incidentally he negotiated with the Board of Trade about 1912 that Freshwater trains could be propelled to and from Newport station, overturning the old prohibition which required running round on every trip.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a theory of}} general equilibrium with externalities and/or monopoly. We assume that the firm's decisions {{are based on the}} <b>preferences</b> of <b>shareholders</b> and/or other stakeholders.

In the absence of externalities, equilibrium with a monopoly will be Pareto efficient if the firm can price discriminate. The equilibrium can be implemented by a 2 -part tariff...|$|R
40|$|In February 2004, the Victorian Court of Appeal {{upheld a}} {{decision}} (comprised of two judgments) of Justice Mandie regarding {{the validity of}} a ‘scheme of arrangement’ proposed by Village Roadshow {{to engage in a}} selective buy-back of its A-Class preference shares. Mandie J’s decision at first instance, confirmed on appeal, not to approve the scheme of arrangement was significant not just because it put to rest a very public year-long tussle between the company and its <b>preference</b> <b>shareholders,</b> but also because of the legal implications of the decision- particularly in relation to the interpretation to be given to the buy-back provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 {{and the way in which}} schemes of arrangement can and will be utilised going forward. This paper assesses the issues that came before the Victorian Supreme Court and Court of Appeal for consideration, and reflects on the legal and commercial implications of the decisions. The author also responds to the assertion that Village Roadshow had to use a scheme of arrangement to effect the selective buy-back, and raises the question of whether schemes of arrangement are becoming overutilised...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a theory of}} a monopolist in general equilibrium. We assume that the firm's decisions {{are based on the}} <b>preferences</b> of <b>shareholders</b> and/or other stake-holders. We show that the monopolist will charge less than the profit-maximising price, since shareholders suffer part of the cost of a price rise if they are also consumers. If price discrimination is possible, the resulting equilibrium will be Pareto efficient. We use the model {{to examine the effects of}} increasing stake-holder representation in firms. � A related result shows that a non-profit firm will produce fewer negative externalities. ...|$|R
5000|$|There was a gap of only [...] miles {{between the}} BP&GV at Pwll and the Llanelly and Mynydd Mawr Railway at Sandy, and a connection, {{enabling}} BP&GVR traffic to reach Llanelly harbour was proposed. In early 1889 the L&MMR was approached {{to see if}} it would agree to the connection, and the outcome was that the L&MMR offered to purchase the BP&GVR instead. At the time the BP&GVR was still heavily indebted and the purchase would have cleared the debts. The existing shares in the company were almost worthless, but acceptance of the offer would have realised that unpalatable fact, and after some hesitation the offer was put in abeyance in 1890. Instead a financial reconstruction was arranged, in which many shareholders received reduced holdings and debenture holders lower interest rates; arrears of interest were cancelled. The scheme was accepted and the former £373,000 issued capital of the company was reduced to £148,000. This enabled the company to apply to be released from receivership and this took place on 5 July 1895. The company soon found itself unable to pay the current interest, however, and it was returned to receivership on 6 February 1896. This second period lasted until release on 29 July 1898. For the half year ended 30 June 1899 <b>preference</b> <b>shareholders</b> received a dividend of %, although ordinary shareholders had to wait.|$|R

40|$|Cross-holdings {{are created}} when a {{shareholder}} of one firm holds shares in other firms as well, and cross-holdings alter <b>shareholder</b> <b>preferences</b> over corporate {{decisions that affect}} those other firms. Prior evidence suggests that such cross-holdings explain the puzzle of why shareholders allow acquisitions that reduce {{the value of the}} bidder. Conducting a shareholder-level analysis of cross-holdings, we instead find that cross-holdings are too small to matter in most acquisitions and that bidders do not bid more aggressively even in the few cases in which cross-holdings are large. We conclude that cross-holdings do not explain value-reducing acquisitions. Beyond acquisitions, we find that institutional cross-holdings between large firms have, in fact, increased rapidly over the last 20 years, but mostly due to indexing and quasi-indexing. As in acquisitions, cross-holdings by active investors are typically too small to matter.

30|$|This study uses {{networking}} capital as a {{proxy for}} firms’ liquidity. Based on the trade-off theory, Alves and Ferreira (2011) suggest that firm asset liquidity is positively correlated with leverage. However, Deesomsak et al. (2004) suggest a negative relationship. Their arguments are based on pecking order theory. Moreover, they argue that managers may change liquid assets to give <b>preference</b> to <b>shareholders</b> instead of debt holders and thereby increasing the associated agency costs. This implies a negative relationship between assets’ liquidity and leverage. Thus, the relationship between leverage and a firm’s asset liquidity is an unclear one and it can be positive as well as negative.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{incorporates}} {{a model of}} corporate control into a general equilibrium framework with incomplete markets. The classical objective of value maximization is extended but is indeterminate. Instead, firms are viewed as being subject to shareholder control via some decision mechanism. As long as this decision mechanism is responsive to a unanimous <b>preference</b> by <b>shareholders,</b> shareholder control is consistent with, but stronger than, value maximization. The particular institution of majority voting by shareholders is examined. It is shown that, for generic economies, a majority rule equilibrium for a firm implies that production is optimal for the largest, or dominant, shareholder.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple model of market equilibrium {{to explain why}} firms that maximize {{the value of their}} shares pay dividends even though the funds could instead be retained and subsequently distributed to shareholders {{in a way that would}} allow them to be taxed more favorably as capital gains. The two principal ingredients of our explanation are:(1) the conflicting <b>preferences</b> of <b>shareholders</b> in different tax brackets and (2) the shareholders' desire for portfolio diversification, we show that companies will pay a positive fraction of earnings in dividends. We also provide some comparative static analysis of dividend behavior with respect to tax parameters and to the conditions determining the riskiness of the securities. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} choice of {{financial}} advisors in cross-border M&As in Europe using a sample of 598 cross-border M&As from 2000 to 2012, where the firms are from the 12 European countries that adopted the euro as their currency in 1999. My study expands the work of Francis et al. (2014) to European acquirers and investigates if {{the same kind of}} home <b>preference</b> of <b>shareholders</b> and acquirers exists in Europe than in the U. S. Additionally, I examine how the ongoing process towards a single M&A market has affected {{the choice of}} financial advisors in the European Union and how it differs from deals done elsewhere. I find that the same kind of home <b>preference</b> by <b>shareholders</b> and acquirers that exits in the U. S. does not exist in Europe. In fact, the choice of financial advisors does not explain abnormal returns at all, and the number of transactions advised by the Home and Expert advisors is almost the same. I also I find that firms are more likely to use home advisors if the target country is one of the 12 European countries that adopted the euro in the first stage. This indicates that the process towards a single M&A market has reduced diffrences between corporate practices in the European Union. However, any strong conclusions cannot be made based on my study as my research suggests that the financial advisor classification to Home and Expert advisors {{may not be the best}} indicator to examine the choice of financial advisors at all. It is problematic to use two competing hypotheses because they are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, my study suggests that a new method should be developed to explore the choice of financial advisors in cross-border M&As...|$|R
40|$|Earnings less riskfree Interest Charge (ERIC) {{is a new}} {{residual}} income concept for Value Based Management (VBM), which takes the true risk and time <b>preferences</b> of <b>shareholders</b> into account. In this paper management based on ERIC is discussed from a theoretical and from a more practical point of view. Starting in a theoretical world it is shown that ERIC fulfills the specific basic theoretical requirements {{in all areas of}} VBM. In particular using ERIC in VBM ensures that planing, performance measurement, management incentives and decentralization are goal congruent with respect to market value. In a second step market imperfections and diverging preferences of managers, which lead to conflict of interest between individual shareholders and between management and shareholders, are considered. Accounting principles for determining {{residual income}} as ERIC are established. It is shown that regarding these accounting principles can substantially diminish conflict of interest and enhance shareholder value...|$|R
40|$|This Note {{explores the}} {{incentives}} and <b>preferences</b> of <b>shareholders</b> in takeovers. This analysis is {{conducted in the}} context of the Delaware Chancery Court’s February 2011 decision in Air Products 2 ̆ 6 Chemicals v. Airgas. In that case, the court’s decision largely turned on whether certain short-term and long-term <b>shareholders</b> have different <b>preferences</b> and incentives in takeovers. This Note adopts a similar focus but frames the question in terms of whether Hedge Funds, shareholders perceived as short-term motivated, and Institutional Investors, shareholders perceived as long-term motivated, evince different preferences and incentives in takeovers. This Note’s analysis relies on both academic inquiries into the shareholders’ investment strategies and empirical data about the shareholders’ actual investment choices. This Note also compares and contrasts its findings with existing academic takeover analysis. Overall, this Note finds limited evidence of similarities between these shareholders’ incentives and preferences in the takeover context...|$|R
40|$|In {{competitive}} economies {{with private}} firm ownership, incomplete markets, and firm shareholders changing over time, several firm objectives have been proposed. Some are useful to understand efficiency of equilibria, {{and others are}} explicitly consistent with majority shareholder control or collective choice rules, {{but it is not}} always clear if versions of each type are consistent with versions of the other type. This paper shows that ex-post, value maximizing rules, (including those proposed by Dreze(1974), and Grossman and Hart (1979),) are consistent with <b>shareholder</b> <b>preferences</b> in such economies; that is, along the equilibrium path, in every period and state of the world, every coalition of a firm's shareholders in that period and state approves a value maximizing production plan. This result applies to cases when shareholders within a firm and across firms can form coalitions, and when stock trading can be ex-dividend or cum-dividend, and with a combination of both. This result does not resolve the problem of inefficiency of stock market equilibria, or that of ex ante disagreement among shareholders. It can help understand when firm objectives with some desirable properties are consistent with a particular version of shareholder control, and it provides a stability criterion (in terms of robustness to shareholder coalitions) for organizing productive resources in such economies.

40|$|This article {{argues that}} Native {{corporations}} can provide employment preferences for Alaska Natives, {{so long as}} they are appropriately tailored to provide employment preferences to that corporation 2 ̆ 7 s shareholders or those closely related to the shareholders. Moreover, a hiring <b>preference</b> based on <b>shareholder</b> status is not a preference based on race and, as such, does not violate Alaska state law. 24 But even if the Alaska Supreme Court found that these hiring preferences did violate the state constitution, given the federal government 2 ̆ 7 s unique relationship with Native corporations 25 and Congress 2 ̆ 7 s clear intent for Native corporations to favor Alaska Natives in their hiring practices, federal courts would likely find that under ANCSA, Congress has preempted Alaska state law that would disallow hiring <b>preferences</b> for <b>shareholders</b> and their families. Thus, if properly tailored, Native corporations could use hiring preferences {{to meet the needs of}} shareholders, their spouses, and their closely related descendants. The article is divided into six parts. Part I provides background about the Alaska Native corporations and their justifications for using hiring preferences.
