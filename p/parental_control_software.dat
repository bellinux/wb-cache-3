40|$|Background: There {{is growing}} {{research}} {{interest in the}} association between <b>parental</b> <b>control</b> and child anxiety. <b>Parental</b> <b>control</b> may enhance child anxiety and parents may exert control in anticipation of their child's anxiety-related distress. Moreover, high levels of anxiety in parents could influence the development of <b>parental</b> <b>control.</b> Whereas past reviews have solely examined the relation between child anxiety and <b>parental</b> <b>control,</b> this meta-analysis focuses on the associations between both child and parent anxiety and <b>parental</b> <b>control.</b> Methods: The associations of parent anxiety and child anxiety with observed <b>parental</b> <b>control</b> (k= 23 studies, N= 1, 305 parent-child dyads) were investigated using a meta-analytic approach. Moreover, factors were identified that may function as moderators of these relations, such as parent and child gender, family socioeconomic status, child age, and design and measurement characteristics. Results: A substantial association between child anxiety and <b>parental</b> <b>control</b> (d=. 58) was found. Moderator analyses yielded the strongest effect sizes for studies with an overrepresentation of girls, for school-aged children, for families from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, and for studies using a discussion task to assess <b>parental</b> <b>control.</b> Although a nonsignificant relation was found for the relation between parent anxiety and <b>parental</b> <b>control</b> (d=. 08), small but significant effects were found for school-aged children, for studies using a discussion task to assess <b>parental</b> <b>control,</b> and for samples with an overrepresentation of boys.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{contribution of}} child and parent trait anxiety on paternal and maternal controlling behaviour was examined. Thirty-seven children, aged 8 - 11 years, completed two difficult Tangram puzzles, one with their father and one with their mother. Videotapes of the parent-child interactions were rated on <b>parental</b> <b>control</b> and child dependent and withdrawn behaviour. Results indicated that, opposite to expectations, higher mother and father trait anxiety was associated {{with lower levels of}} <b>parental</b> <b>control,</b> and that the relation between parent trait anxiety and <b>parental</b> <b>control</b> was curvilinear. Furthermore, a significant stronger effect between child trait anxiety and <b>parental</b> <b>control</b> was found for boys than for girls.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} anxiety and ethnicity on <b>parental</b> <b>control</b> {{as well as the}} effects ethnicity, anxiety, and <b>parental</b> <b>control</b> have on child diagnostic severity, anxious African American and Caucasian families were compared. Sixty-nine parent-child dyads completed the study. Forty-two mothers in the sample suffered from an anxiety disorder whereas twenty-seven mothers did not meet criteria for any current or past psychopathology. Parent-child dyads were videotaped as they completed two mildly stressful tasks together. Parental and child behaviors during the interactions were coded to obtain an objective measure of parents 2 ̆ 7 behavior. Data were reduced to produce four behavioral composites one of which, 2 ̆ 2 overcontrolling, 2 ̆ 2 was used to assess objective ratings of <b>parental</b> <b>control.</b> Subjective <b>parental</b> <b>control</b> was assessed by two self-report measures of parenting behaviors. Four hierarchical linear regressions were conducted. It was hypothesized that parental anxiety would predict high control in Caucasian families whereas parental anxiety would predict low <b>parental</b> <b>control</b> in African American families. It was further hypothesized that <b>parental</b> <b>control</b> would positively predict child diagnostic severity in anxious Caucasian families whereas <b>parental</b> <b>control</b> would negatively predict child diagnostic severity in anxious African American families. Ethnicity did not significantly predict <b>parental</b> <b>control</b> in either group. As expected, parental anxiety predicted child diagnostic severity. Ethnicity did not significantly predict child diagnostic severity as an outcome variable. The interaction term of ethnicity and parental anxiety failed to predict both objective ratings of <b>parental</b> <b>control</b> and subjective ratings of <b>parental</b> <b>control.</b> The interaction term of ethnicity, <b>parental</b> <b>control</b> (both objective and subjective ratings), and parental anxiety failed to predict child diagnostic severity. Exploratory analyses indicated that both subjective <b>parental</b> <b>control</b> and ethnicity play integral roles along with parental anxiety in predicting child diagnostic status. Exploratory analyses further indicated that anxious Caucasian parents and highly controlling Caucasian parents are more likely than African American parents in general to have an anxious child. Findings from the current sample indicate that anxious African American and Caucasian parents do not seemingly differ with regard to control behaviors toward their children, although African Americans seem less likely to have an anxious child. Future directions are discussed in terms of matched samples of African American and Caucasian families, within group comparisons of African American families, further objective measurement, improved subjective ratings of <b>parental</b> <b>control,</b> and larger sample size...|$|R
