2500|$|The Early Entrance Program (EEP) is {{an early}} college {{entrance}} program for gifted individuals of {{middle school and high}} school ages. The unique educational program is specifically designed to permit young, highly gifted students to enroll in college as full-time students. The Early Entrance Program was established at California State University, Los Angeles in 1982. The Program allows qualified students as young as 11 years of age the opportunity to excel at the university level. The program maintains a population of approximately 150 full-time highly gifted teen-aged students known as [...] "EEPsters." [...] Every year, approximately 100 academically gifted students from all over the United States apply to EEP, with around 30 applicants admitted. Students must achieve a combined verbal and mathematics score of 1100 on the SAT, with neither score falling below 550; or at least a 24 in English and a 23 in mathematics on the ACT. After a <b>preliminary</b> <b>interview</b> with the EEP director, prospective students must also undergo a rigorous assessment period called a Provisional Quarter (or [...] "Provie Summer") before final admission.|$|E

He had insisted upon her immediately accompanying Susy and himself to Mrs. Peyton in San Francisco. Horror-stricken and terrified at the catastrophe, and frightened by the strange looks of the excited servants, they did not dare to disobey him. He had left them with Mrs. Peyton in the briefest <b>preliminary</b> <b>interview,</b> during which he spoke only of the catastrophe, shielding {{the woman from the}} presumption of having provoked it, and urging only the importance of settling the question of guardianship at once. It was odd that Mrs. Peyton had been less disturbed than he imagined she would be at even his charitable version of Susy's unfaithfulness to her; it even seemed to him that she had already suspected it. But {{as he was about to}} withdraw to leave her to meet them alone, she had stopped him suddenly.|$|E

He suggested that a [...] "suspension for a significant time" [...] was more appropriate.|$|R
60|$|On Sunday Hampstead {{was nervous}} and fidgety. He had {{at one time}} {{thought that it would}} be the very day for him to go to Holloway. He would be sure to find Mrs. Roden at home after church, and then, if he could carry things to the {{necessary}} length, he might also see Zachary Fay. But on consideration it appeared to him that Sunday would not suit his purpose. George Roden would be there, and would be sadly in the way. And the Quaker himself would be in the way, as it would be necessary that he should have some <b>preliminary</b> <b>interview</b> with Marion before anything could be serviceably said to her father. He was driven, therefore, to postpone his visit. Nor would Monday do, as he knew enough of the manners of Paradise Row to be aware that on Monday Mrs. Vincent would certainly be there. It would be his object, if things could be made to go pleasantly, first to see Mrs. Roden for a few minutes, and then to spend as much of the afternoon as might be possible with Marion Fay. He therefore fixed on the Tuesday for his purpose, and having telegraphed about the country for his horses, groom, and other appurtenances, he went down to Leighton on the Monday, and consoled himself with a day's hunting with the staghounds.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{motivating}} factors behind Information Technology (IT) professionals and what drives their choice of IT as a career. In order to explore this {{a series of interviews}} with thirteen IT professionals have been undertaken including a set of <b>preliminary</b> <b>interviews,</b> interviews with IT professionals from a consultancy organisation and a tertiary institution working on a common project, interviews with IT professionals in a large government organisation, and questionnaires distributed to an online community. The individuals participating in this study generally described exposure to technology at an early age and a subsequent interest in technology. These participants went on in later years to show an intrinsic motivation for pursuing technology. For this group of people the opportunity to interact with technology while young assisted them in developing an interest in working with technology and in retaining that interest.

Not only do we propose to investigate B 2 B loyalty but also how this construct occurs across cultures, i. e., is B 2 B loyalty affected by culture? Preliminary research results indicate that Japanese companies will change foreign supplier more easily than Portuguese companies as Japanese society is very competitive and has higher levels of ethnocentrism. Based on <b>preliminary</b> <b>interviews</b> and a literature review we propose that masculinity, ethnocentrism and suppliers’ cultural interaction capabilities are antecedents of cross-cultural customers’ loyalty...|$|R

From the people identified by farmers as forming their agricultural advice networks, we identified whether {{he or she}} was a government official or extension worker. Official advice networks are a function of the number of government officials or local extension service workers whom farmers consult regarding coffee and/or cocoa cultivation. Officials are considered an annex of farmers’ local networks. They are more advanced in terms of knowledge, experience, and resources and often advise farmers on farming practices. In this study, we regard government officials and extension workers as bridging ties.|$|R
