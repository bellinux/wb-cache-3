5000|$|The <b>Prop</b> <b>Wash</b> Award was {{introduced}} at the USAF Test Pilot school in 1956. The award {{takes the form}} of a wooden aircraft propellor to which plaques bearing the name of each honoree are mounted. <b>Prop</b> <b>wash</b> refers to the spiral-shaped slipstream formed behind a rotating propeller on an aircraft. The phrase, Illegitimi non carborundum, a mock-Latin aphorism meaning [...] "Don't let the bastards grind you down" [...] is engraved on the face.|$|R

25|$|The 112 and 114 are {{conventional}} layout monoplanes {{with the}} main wing set low and a mid-mounted horizontal stabilizer. This places the stabilizer outside the <b>prop</b> <b>wash,</b> and results in heavier handling at lower speeds.|$|R
25|$|In 1985, he was {{selected}} to attend the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School (TPS) at Edwards Air Force Base in California and graduated with Class 86A. His fellow students presented Brown with the Onizuka <b>Prop</b> <b>Wash</b> Award as the student who contributed most to class spirit and morale. The <b>Prop</b> <b>Wash</b> Award {{is dedicated to the}} memory of TPS graduate Colonel Ellison Onizuka who died {{as a member of the}} crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1986. Following graduation, Brown tested the A-7 Corsair II, all models of the F-15 Eagle, and performed flight trials on a number of classified prototype aircraft. In 1992, after sixteen years of service, Brown separated from the Air Force.|$|R
50|$|McDougall {{had learned}} from {{experience}} the difficulties encountered in towing these vessels. The bows and spars made them subject to the forces of wind, wave, and the <b>prop</b> <b>wash</b> from the towing vessel, {{with the result that}} they often did not follow well. His purpose was specifically to create a barge design that could be towed easily and would track well.|$|R

50|$|Distinguishing {{features}} of the Dash 8 design are the large T-tail intended to keep the tail free of <b>prop</b> <b>wash</b> during takeoff, a very high aspect ratio wing, the elongated engine nacelles also holding the rearward-folding landing gear, and the pointed nose profile. First flight was on June 20, 1983, and the airliner entered service in 1984 with NorOntair. In 1984, Piedmont Airlines, formerly Henson Airlines, was the first US customer for the Dash 8.|$|R
50|$|In 1929, she was {{purchased}} by Foss Tug & Launch Company, and leased to MGM Studios to star in the 1933 blockbuster hit Tugboat Annie. Afterwards, Foss rebuilt the ship from the waterline up, and installed a state-of-the-art, 700 hp Washington Ironworks diesel engine, and renamed it Arthur Foss. A year later, a power-steering assist system was installed, because the <b>prop</b> <b>wash</b> from the more powerful engine made steering virtually impossible for a single person.|$|R
50|$|The term {{may be used}} {{to refer}} {{specifically}} to those systems that use internal ductwork within the wing to direct the airflow, or more broadly to systems like upper surface blowing or nozzle systems on conventional underwing engine which that direct air through the flaps. Blown flaps are one solution among a broader category known as powered lift, which also includes various boundary layer control systems, systems using directed <b>prop</b> <b>wash,</b> and circulation control wings.|$|R
5000|$|The airboat {{is pushed}} {{forward by the}} propeller, which {{produces}} a rearward column of air behind it. The resulting <b>prop</b> <b>wash</b> averages 150 mph. Steering is accomplished by diverting that column of air left or right as it passes across the rudders, which the pilot controls via a [...] "stick" [...] located on the operator's left side. Overall steering and control {{is a function of}} water current, wind, water depth, and propeller thrust.|$|R
50|$|Although many {{aircraft}} {{are capable of}} moving themselves backwards on the ground using reverse thrust (a procedure {{referred to as a}} powerback), the resulting jet blast or <b>prop</b> <b>wash</b> may cause damage to the terminal building or equipment. Engines close to the ground may also blow sand and debris forward and then suck it into the engine, causing damage to the engine. A pushback is therefore the preferred method to move the aircraft away from the gate.|$|R
50|$|Very early {{aircraft}} had no canopies at all. The {{pilots were}} exposed to the wind and weather, although most flying was done in good weather. Through World War I most aircraft had no canopy, although they often had a small windshield to deflect the <b>prop</b> <b>wash</b> and wind from hitting the pilot in the face. In the 1920s and 1930s, the increasing speed and altitude of airplanes necessitated a fully enclosed cockpit and canopies became more common.|$|R
50|$|The first {{aircraft}} he downed was unfortunately his own P-47 fighter. On {{a mission}} on August 12, 1943, {{he decided to}} inch {{closer and closer to}} within feet of a B-24 bomber that was nearby. He was caught in the B-24's <b>prop</b> <b>wash</b> and sucked under its wing, and when he tried to pull away, the tail and fuselage of his airplane was shredded by one of the B-24's propellers, forcing him to bail out. The B-24 had to crash-land.|$|R

U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps {{students from the}} Naval Test Pilot School at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station, Maryland attend the USAF TPS and vice versa. Foreign students may also attend and include those from the Empire Test Pilots' School at Boscombe Down, England, and the EPNER (École du Personnel Navigant d'Essais et de Réception), the French Test Pilots' School.

25|$|During {{a routine}} {{training}} flight on 7 December 1944 in the B-17 Mercy's Madhouse, the right landing gear collapsed, but Goering managed {{to steer the}} aircraft to a safe landing amid a shower of sparks and thick smoke. Another incident occurred when taking off for the bombing of Dresden on 15 February 1945. Taking off in dense fog, the unnamed B-17 he was flying got caught in <b>prop</b> <b>wash</b> from an adjacent runway, and pushed sideways. The plane crashed on takeoff, breaking into three parts. The bombardier suffered a broken arm and three other crewmen had minor injuries, but all managed to get clear before the plane exploded.|$|R

50|$|The Liberty Belle (43-38037), a B-17G, {{arrived at}} the Lavenham Airfield on 27 May 1944 {{as a member of}} the 836th Bombardment Squadron, 487th Bombardment Group. It was {{involved}} in a mid air collision with the B-17G “Heavenly Body” (43-38154) on 30 September 1944. After a sharp turn in heavy contrails, this B-17 was caught in <b>prop</b> <b>wash</b> (presumed), went over on its back and collided with Tail Number 43-38154 of the same squadron. The right wing of '38037 and the left wing of '38154 came off and both aircraft crashed at Bexterhagen, 9 km east of Bielefeld. Only 3 out of 18 men on the two aircraft survived.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} types of steering. Taildragger {{aircraft}} may be steered by rudder alone (depending upon the <b>prop</b> <b>wash</b> produced by the aircraft to turn it) with a freely pivoting tail wheel, or by a steering linkage with the tail wheel, or by differential braking (the use of independent brakes {{on opposite sides of}} the aircraft to turn the aircraft by slowing one side more sharply than the other). Aircraft with tricycle landing gear usually have a steering linkage with the nosewheel (especially in large aircraft), but some allow the nosewheel to pivot freely and use differential braking and/or the rudder to steer the aircraft, like the Cirrus SR22.|$|R
50|$|The KC-130J also {{provides}} for rapid ground refueling of helicopters, vehicles and fuel caches. The aircraft {{has a unique}} propeller feathering feature (known as “hotel mode”, derived from the term hotel electric power, when a vessel or other means of transport {{is equipped with a}} power plant with the sole purpose of generating electric power for lighting, etc., rather than propulsion) which can slow (at 25% rotation speed) the propellers while the turbines continue to run and energize the generator, providing power to the electric fuel pumps. This reduction of the propellers' speed helps to eliminate <b>prop</b> <b>wash</b> behind the KC-130J. This allows ground forces to operate in relative calm while the aircraft offloads up to 2,271 L, 1,823 kg (600 gallons, 4,018 pounds) per minute.|$|R
5000|$|A {{deep stall}} (or super-stall) is a {{dangerous}} type of stall that affects certain aircraft designs, notably jet aircraft with a T-tail configuration and rear-mounted engines. In these designs, the turbulent wake of a stalled main wing, nacelle-pylon wakes and the wake from the fuselage [...] "blanket" [...] the horizontal stabilizer, rendering the elevators ineffective and preventing the aircraft from recovering from the stall. Taylor states T-tail propeller aircraft, unlike jet aircraft, do not usually require a stall recovery system during stall flight testing due to increased airflow over the wing root from the <b>prop</b> <b>wash.</b> Nor do they have rear mounted nacelles which can contribute substantially to the problem.The A400M was fitted with a vertical tail booster for some flight tests in case of deep stall.|$|R
50|$|The Farman F.200 was on display, unflown, on the Farman {{stand in}} the 1922 Paris Salon, where its unusual {{appearance}} attracted attention, but it rapidly disappeared from the French contemporary journals. There are two accounts of its development, one contemporary and one from the late 20th century, which strongly conflict. Les Ailes, writing in early April 1923 states briefly that tests showed it to be very manoeuvrable and fast, with a maximum speed of 200 km/h. In J. Liron's 1984 account it was not flown until May {{and then as a}} single-seater since in earlier tests it was unable to take-off with two aboard; worse, the May tests showed it to be totally uncontrollable as the thick wing root, close to the propeller, blanked the tail from the slipstream and <b>prop</b> <b>wash.</b> Liron does not say if the lack of control was at take-off or in flight.|$|R
5000|$|The pair of {{propellers}} on each {{wing of the}} A400M turn {{in opposite}} directions, with {{the tips of the}} propellers advancing from above towards the midpoint between the two engines. This is in contrast to the overwhelming majority of multi-engine propeller driven aircraft where all propellers turn in the same direction. The counter-rotation is achieved by the use of a gearbox fitted to two of the engines, and only the propeller turns the opposite direction; all four engines are identical and turn in the same direction. This eliminates the need to have two different [...] "handed" [...] engines on stock for the same aircraft, simplifying maintenance and supply costs. This configuration, dubbed down between engines (DBE), allows the aircraft to produce more lift and lessens the torque and <b>prop</b> <b>wash</b> on each wing. It also reduces yaw {{in the event of an}} outboard engine failure.|$|R

2500|$|The two {{different}} wings {{known to have}} been fitted to the Parasol both had constant chord and very square tips. [...] They were of fabric covered wood construction.

[...] He also controlled an hydraulic brake which was used to stop the engine during measurements and avoid <b>prop</b> <b>wash</b> interference. [...] After a period of gliding flight, the engine could be restarted with a gas starter.|$|R
40|$|Fixed-wing micro air {{vehicles}} (MAV) {{are very}} attractive for outdoor surveillance missions since they generally offer better payload and endurance capabilities than rotorcraft or flapping-wing vehicles of equal size. They are generally less challenging to control than helicopter in outdoor environment. However, high wing loading associated with stringent dimension constraints requires high cruise speeds for fixed-wing MAVs {{and it has}} been difficult so far to achieve good performances at low-speed flight using fixed-wing configurations. The present paper investigates the possibility to improve the aerodynamic performance of classical fixed-wing MAV concepts so that high cruise speed is maintained for covertness and stable hover flight is achieved to allow building intrusion and indoor surveillance. Monoplane wing plan forms are compared with biplane concepts using low-speed wind tunnel measurements and numerical calculations including viscous effects. Wind-tunnel measurements including the influence of counter-rotating propellers indicate that a biplane-twin propeller MAV configuration can drastically increase low-speed and high-speed aerodynamic performances over the classical monoplane fixed-wing concept. Control in hover flight can highly benefit from the effect of counter-rotating propellers as demonstrated by flight tests. After describing the flight dynamics model including the <b>prop</b> <b>wash</b> effect over control surfaces, a contro...|$|R

5000|$|The {{three part}} parasol {{wing of the}} Libellule was {{rectangular}} in plan and without dihedral. Built around two box spars, its centre section was held high above the fuselage by pairs of parallel, outward-leaning struts from the spars at its extremities to the upper fuselage longerons and the outer panels were braced with duraluminum V-struts from the lower longerons out to the spars at about 60% span. The wing position {{had the advantage of}} keeping it largely clear of the <b>prop</b> <b>wash</b> and, by lowering the centre of gravity, increasing lateral stability. The centre section was entirely covered with Rhodoïd, a transparent material used to provide an uninterrupted upward view from the cockpits, and the outer panels covered with fabric. [...] The Libellule's unusual ailerons, designed by Peyret, ran from the tips to about mid-span; mounted on the rear spar, they were divided span-wise into two roughly equal chord parts, hinged together and interconnected so that the rear surface had a greater deflection than the forward one, particularly in the case of upward deflections. The intention was to retain lateral control down to the lowest speeds.|$|R
50|$|As Glacier Northwest {{claims that}} the usage of barges is not {{detrimental}} to the environment, those against the mine expansion, especially those from Preserve Our Island, disagree. They claim that the physical effects of the barge itself, and the side-effects of its loading procedures, can be detrimental to the near shore environment. It is estimated that the velocity of the <b>prop</b> <b>wash</b> from these barges can re-suspend about 90% of the ambient bed material in the shallow waters. This effect, contrary to Glacier Northwest's attempt at mitigation, would not be avoided even if the dock and loading site were extended into deeper waters as planned because of the likely possibility of aggregate falling {{over the side of}} the barge into the sound. The effect of this spillage could then raise the ambient bed as it is collected on the ocean floor, exposing it to the dangers of the barge's prop-wash. These effects would pose a more significant effect during low tides, as outlined in the continuing section on the remaining eelgrass beds. By using barge ships as their main form of transport, Glacier Northwest is also putting South Maury Island’s fragile habitat at an extremely high risk for oil spills. An oil spill would demolish the near shore habitat, which would affect the fish, birds, and sea mammals living throughout the Puget Sound.|$|R
5000|$|Hop Harrigan's {{story begins}} with him {{being raised by}} his neighbor, who tried to gain legal {{guardianship}} of him {{in order to try}} to obtain Hop's inheritance (of which he was successful). Hop Harrigan had been orphaned by his father, a legendary pilot, who disappeared on a flight to South America to see his wife. By the time Hop Harrigan had almost grown, his neighbor tried to destroy a biplane that once had been in the possession of Hop's father. Seeing this, Hop angrily knocked the old man to the ground and escaped in the biplane, not planning to return. He arrived at an airport where he saved the life of mechanic Tank Tinker, who became his friend and companion. Tank gave Harrigan his nickname when he said, [...] "Some hop, Harrigan." [...] Later, Hop, Tank and <b>Prop</b> <b>Wash</b> (the pilot who accidentally endangered Tank), along with help from an heiress (who later became Hop's girlfriend), set up the All-American Aviation Company, a company that dealt with a variety of exciting adventures. By the time World War II came, as with most other comics of the time, the Hop Harrigan comic started to have World War II themed adventures as Hop, Tank and Prop joined the US Army Air Corps in service of the war effort.|$|R
2500|$|The {{two main}} {{problems}} facing Parnall when given an Air Ministry contract to produce such an aircraft were to ensure that, {{so far as}} possible the behaviour of the wing was unaffected by interference with the flow over the fuselage or by <b>prop</b> <b>wash,</b> and to devise a way of measuring lift and drag forces whilst in flight. [...] They decided on a parasol wing design, since this would avoid complications like wing root interference, and made the wing mounting structure into a single unit with some freedom to deflect internally so that the force could be measured. [...] A typical parasol wing aircraft has lift struts from the lower fuselage to the wing plus some upper fuselage struts to support the wing near the centre line. The Parasol had two lift struts under each wing, with their lower ends joined within the fuselage to a horizontal rectangular frame. Two inverted V members were also attached to this frame, one at the front and one at the back, rising almost vertically {{to the front and}} rear wing spars. [...] The V-struts were hinged top and bottom, allowing the wing to move parallel to the horizontal frame under aerodynamic loads. The force was measured by a dynamometer ahead of the front cockpit, via a linkage which ran down and forward from the wing at an angle of about 22°, then turned back to the instrument via a crank.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, in full {{expectation}} of these distinguished guests, Luckie Macleary had swept her {{house for the}} first time this fortnight, tempered her turf-fire to such a heat as the season required in her damp hovel even at Midsummer, set forth her deal table newly <b>washed,</b> <b>propped</b> its lame foot with a fragment of turf, arranged four or five stools of huge and clumsy form upon the sites which best suited the inequalities of her clay floor; and having, moreover, put on her clean toy, rokelay, and scarlet plaid, gravely awaited the arrival of the company, in full hope of custom and profit. When they were seated under the sooty rafters of Luckie Macleary's only apartment, thickly tapestried with cobwebs, their hostess, who had already taken her cue from the Laird of Balmawhapple, appeared with a huge pewter measuring-pot, containing at least three English quarts, familiarly denominated a Tappit Hen, and which, in the language of the hostess, reamed (i.e., mantled) with excellent claret just drawn from the cask.|$|R
40|$|The Big Horn Mountains are a geologically complex {{range that}} extends over 500 square km in west-central Arizona. Three major lithologic terranes outcrop: (1) Proterozoic amphibolite, phyllite, schists, gneiss, and granite; (2) Mesozoic {{monzonite}} to diorite intrusives; and (3) Cenozoic mafic to silicic volcanic rocks and clastic rocks. The entire area {{is in the}} upper plate of a detachment fault and, consequently, contains many low- to high-angle normal faults. Each lithologic terrane has its associated mineral occurrences. The Big Horn district is exclusively hosted in the pre- Tertiary terrane. Most of its mineral occurrences are spatially related to the Late Cretaceous intrusive rocks. One occurrence, the Pump Mine, may be a metamorphic secretion deposit, and therefore, would be middle Proterozoic. The {{vast majority of the}} mineral occurrences in the Big Horn Mountains are middle Tertiary in age and occur in three districts: the Tiger Wash barite - fluorite district; the Aguila manganese district; and the Osborne base and precious metal district. Fluid inclusions from Tiger Wash fluorite (T(h) 120 to 210 ° C, NaCl wt. equivalent 17 to 18 percent not corrected for CO₂) and nearby detachment - fault- hosted Harquahala district fluorite (T(h) 150 to 230 ° C., NaC 1 wt. equivalent 15. 5 to 20 percent not corrected for CO₂) suggest cooling and dilution of fluids as they are presumed to evolve from the detachment fault into the upper plate. Mass-balance calculations suggest that the proposed evolution of fluids is sufficient to account for the observed tonnage of barite and fluorite. The Tiger <b>Wash</b> <b>occurrences</b> grade directly into calcite- gangue-dominated manganese oxides of the Aguila district. A wide range of homogenization temperatures (T(h) 200 to 370 ° C.), an absence of CO₂ and low salinities (NaC 1 wt. equivalent 1 to 2 percent) in the Aguila district calcite-hosted fluid inclusions argue for distillation of fluids during boiling or boiling of non saline-meteoric waters. Mass - balance calculations modeling the evolution of Ca and Mn during potassium metasomatism of plagioclase in basalt suggest that little if any influx of these cations is necessary to form the calcite –dominated manganese oxide tonnage observed. The Aguila district grades directly to the east into the base-metal and precious-metal occurrences of the Osborne district. Preliminary data describing geological settings, fluid inclusions, and geochemistry suggest that the Osborne district has a continuum between gold-rich to silver-rich epithermal occurrences. The gold-rich systems have dominantly quartz gangue, with or without fluorite, and are hosted in a variety of rocks, but are proximal to Precambrian phyllite or mid-Tertiary rhyolite. Fluid inclusions from two occurrences representative of the gold -rich systems spread across a minor range (T(h) 190 to 230 ° C., NaC 1 wt. equivalent 17 to 23 percent not corrected for CO₂). Dilution of highly saline fluids is the inferred mechanism for precipitation of gold in the gold-quartz systems. The silver-rich systems have dominantly calcite gangue with or without quartz, and are hosted in mid-Tertiary basalt. Calcite fluid inclusions from a representative high-silver occurrence display a wide range of homogenization temperatures and salinities (T(h) 120 to 370 ° C., NaC 1 wt. equivalent 7 to 23 percent). Boiling and consequent neutralization of acidic solutions is the inferred mechanism for the silver-rich, calcite gangue systems. A model inferring a regional fluid-flow regime and local sources of metals is proposed. Four possible regional and local causes of fluid flow in upper-plate detachment regimes are proposed: (1) regional elevation of geothermal gradients as a result of middle-crustal, lower-plate rocks rising to upper crustal levels; (2) meteoric water recharge along the southeast flank of the Harquahala antiform and consequent displacement of connate waters in the upper-plate of the Big Horn Mountains; (3) local emplacement of feeder stocks to rhyolitic flows; (4) and tilting of major upper-plate structural blocks...|$|R

The bacterial count in water troughs of layer chickens in deep litter system, on Day 1, had no significant differences (p> 0. 05) between the farms, water troughs and their interactions. On Day 3, no significant difference (p> 0. 05) among the parameters.
