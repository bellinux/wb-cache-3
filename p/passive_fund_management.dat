PM-DSS c ○ is a DSS-generator, i. e. specific decision support systems for active as well as <b>passive</b> <b>fund</b> <b>management</b> can be customized using the models and methods which are packaged in PM-DSS c ○. For an introduction into modern portfolio theory see [3] and [4]. In [1] a concept of optimization in passive portfolio management is discussed. The decision situation that we assume is the following: After the initial design of a portfolio the fund manager is constantly confronte...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of active and <b>passive</b> <b>fund</b> <b>management</b> {{has been extensively}} studied especially in the US. This thesis {{is focused on the}} {{performance of}} active and <b>passive</b> <b>fund</b> <b>management</b> in the Finnish and European stock markets during a five-year time span from 3 / 2011 to 3 / 2016. The aim {{of this study is to}} find out which strategy will result in better returns for the small-scale investor. The thesis questions also which strategy leads to a better profit-risk rate and how well the fund managers perform in creating added value. The data of the study consists of 44 active Finnish funds and two passive exchange traded funds available for Finnish investors. Indexes of both Finnish and European markets and a risk-free rate are used to support the analysis. The data for the thesis is collected from the DataStream database. Performance indicators that are used in the study are: return, volatility, Sharpe ratio and Jensen’s alpha. Based on the results of this study it can be concluded that in the Finnish stock market the passive strategy yielded a little better profits than the average of active funds. In the European stock market, the profits for the passive fund were significantly better than the average of active funds. Considering the profit-risk rate, neither strategy out- performed. The results of this thesis are in line with the previous studies, that encourage to favor the passive strategy...|$|E
40|$|Index tracking, {{the most}} popular form of <b>passive</b> <b>fund</b> <b>management,</b> is a {{portfolio}} selection problem in which the return {{of one of the}} stock market indexes is reproduced by creating a tracking portfolio consisting of a subset of the stocks included in the index. Index tracking has been known as an NP-Hard problem, and sophisticated approaches have been proposed in the literature to solve this problem. This paper presents an easyto-implement heuristic solution to this complex problem. The proposed approach was implemented to develop a tracking portfolio of 438 stocks listed in the Tehran Exchange Price Index. The numerical results indicate that the approach is able to identify quality solutions within reasonable model runtime...|$|E

40|$|Pension funds play a {{large role}} in the UK pension system since the returns of the funds {{determine}} how large the total pension will be. The future retirees can choose between active and <b>passive</b> <b>fund</b> <b>management</b> where the active management often is more expensive. In this study 102 actively managed UK equity pension funds are analyzed in order to see if managers have sufficient skill to generate risk adjusted return to cover the cost imposed on the investors. The result implies that the active pension funds in aggregate, before expenses, hold a portfolio that imitates market returns during 2000 to 2012. Bootstrap simulations suggest that only eight funds out of the sample of 102 have skilled managers and six of these managers are skilled enough to produce risk adjusted excess return large enough to cover the expenses imposed on the investor. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} the threshold accepting heuristic for the index tracking problem. The index tracking problem consists in minimizing the tracking error between a portfolio and a benchmark. The objective is to replicate the performance of a given index upon the condition that the number of stocks allowed in the portfolio is smaller than the number of stocks in the benchmark index. Transaction costs are incurred each time that the portfolio is rebalanced. We find the composition of a portfolio that tracks {{the performance of the}} benchmark during a given period in the past and compare it with the performance of the portfolio in a subsequent period. We report computational results in the cases where the benchmarks are market indices tracked by a small number of assets. We find that the threshold accepting heuristic is an e#cient optimization technique for this problem.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the application of}} an index tracking technique to mutual fund replication problems. By using a tracking error (TE) minimization method and two tactical rebalancing strategies (i. e. the calendar based strategy and the tolerance triggered strategy), a multi-period fund tracking model is developed that replicates S&P 500 mutual fund returns. The impact of excess returns and loss aversion on overall tracking performance is also discussed in two extended cases of the original TE optimization respectively. An evolutionary method, namely Differential Evolution, is used for optimizing the asset weights. According to the experiment results, {{it is found that}} the proposed model replicates the first two moments of the fund returns by using only five equities. The TE optimization strategy under loss aversion with tolerance triggered rebalancing dominates other combinations studied with regard to tracking ability and cost efficiency. <b>Passive</b> Portfolio <b>Management,</b> <b>Fund</b> Tracking, MultiPeriod Optimization, Differential Evolution...|$|R

Bogle saw {{this as an opportunity}} to start a <b>passive</b> <b>fund</b> tied to the performance of the S&P 500. Bogle was also inspired by Paul Samuelson, an economist who later won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, who wrote in an August 1976 column in Newsweek that retail investors needed an opportunity to invest in stock market indexes such as the S&P 500. Competitors, which marketed high-fee funds claiming to beat the market, resisted Vanguard's low cost index approach. Some competitors labeled it Bogle's folly, and some claimed it was un-American to simply try to match the performance of the stock market, rather than to try to beat it.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a {{dramatic}} shift from mutual funds into hedge funds even though hedge <b>funds</b> charge <b>management</b> fees that have been decried as outrageous. While expectations of superior returns {{may be responsible for}} this shift, this article shows that mutual funds are more expensive than commonly believed. Mutual funds appear to provide investment services for relatively low fees because they bundle <b>passive</b> and active <b>funds</b> <b>management</b> together in a way that understates the true cost of active <b>management.</b> In particular, <b>funds</b> engaging in “closet” or “shadow” indexing charge their investors for active management while providing them with little more than an indexed investment. Even the average mutual fund, which ostensibly provides only active management, will have over 90 % of the variance in its returns explained by its benchmark index. This article derives a method for allocating fund expenses between active and passive management and constructs a simple formula for finding the cost of active management. Computing this “active expense ratio” requires only a fund’s published expense ratio, its R-squared relative to a benchmark index, and the expense ratio for a competitive fund that tracks that index. At the end of 2004, the mean active expense ratio for the large-cap equity mutual funds tracked by Morningstar was 7 %, over six times their published expense ratio of 1. 15 %. More broadly, funds in the Morningstar universe had a mean active expense ratio of 5. 2 %, while the largest funds averaged a percent or two less. mutual fund expenses, cost allocation, active expense ratio, active alpha, portable alpha...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} {{a critical review}} of the characteristics and performance of Islamic funds in Malaysia with the main objectives of identifying the return and risk profile of Islamic funds and examining the Islamic funds’ performance and valuation methods. The study was conceived {{on the back of}} the impressive growth of the Islamic fund industry amid abundant evidence and a common perception that Islamic funds generally underperform conventional funds. The study is designed to address four main areas, namely to analyse the return and risk characteristics of Islamic funds; to examine the performance trend of Islamic funds; to investigate the impact of Shariah-compliance requirements on Islamic funds’ performance; and, to explore the actual Islamic fund operation by fund management companies through the perception of those involved in the actual practice. To ensure that the study is undertaken thoroughly, the study employed the methodological triangulation technique, of which, the findings are deduced from three methods of analysis namely literature review, quantitative analysis, and qualitative analysis based on primary data collected through interviews. The findings of the study are deemed both intriguing and thought provoking. The study found that the existing Islamic funds have been created largely by mimicking conventional funds whilst economic motive, rather than religious motive, is arguably the main reason behind the creation of Islamic funds. Islamic funds are distinguished from conventional funds based on their Shariah identities, particularly with regards to stock selection and Shariah-compliance supervision. In general, relative to conventional funds, Islamic funds are characterised by a lower return but with higher volatility, have limited numbers of profitable stocks or industries whose returns are strongly and positively correlated, have a smaller fund size and low fund subscription rate, and are mainly invested in heavyweight stocks involved in defensive industries. Interestingly, although the Shariah-screening may expose Islamic funds’ portfolio to have high investment concentration in small-capitalised stocks, the study found that Islamic funds which invest mainly in large-capitalised stocks could outperform conventional funds and the market index. The analysis of Islamic fund performance is also sensitive to the benchmark used for performance comparison. The study also found that Shariah requirements affect Islamic funds’ performance adversely by incurring additional Shariah-related costs and introducing new Shariah non-compliance risks which are peculiar only to Islamic funds. In addition, the study revealed that there is a huge gap in terms of Shariah understanding and adoption of Shariah principles in the creation of Islamic funds. It is noted that despite the finding of Islamic funds’ underperformance, it can be argued that the evidence does not in any way represent a disadvantage of Islamic funds, considering that the underlying philosophy of the funds is not merely to maximise monetary return, but rather, to attain other non-pecuniary motives including adherence to religious principles and achievement of the objectives of the Shariah (maqasid al-shariah). With regards to Islamic fund performance valuation, the study found that the popular methods used by Islamic fund managers are the peer group comparison and the tracking error techniques instead of the traditional risk-adjusted return valuation models. The study also found that active fund management is probably the best strategy for Islamic funds in Malaysia as compared to the simple buy-and-hold or <b>passive</b> <b>fund</b> <b>management</b> strategy. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{popularity}} of the index funds as an investment option has increased manifolds ever since they were introduced. This is {{primarily because of the}} merits that the investor enjoys through <b>passive</b> style of <b>funds</b> <b>management.</b> This includes the low cost involved in managing such funds and the significant tax savings. Most of the researchers have compared the performance of the actively managed funds with that of index funds. However the index funds of US and for that reason {{other parts of the world}} are different from that of India. Unlike other countries in India the benchmark indices comprise of very less number of securities and thus are unable to represent the entire economy. So in Indian context comparison of performance of actively managed funds with index funds is not logical. Therefore this paper attempts to make an intra-class performance evaluation of some Indian index funds based on some statistics. The study includes the use of graphical interpretations coupled with statistical tools like R-square and tracking error values. Two models of tracking error have been employed to test empirically the performance of the selected index funds. The study is useful for those interested in mutual funds, which includes researchers, academicians, and financial advisors. The paper suits the requirement and the situations prevalent in Indian economy during the period under study...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} chapter, I show that mature patent-practicing firms respond to {{windfall}} profits derived from exogenously extended patent protection time {{by engaging in}} external patent acquisitions that diversify their patent portfolios into new technologies. By exploiting the random timing of patent term expiry dates and their unexpected extensions due to the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, I find that a one standard deviation increase in the citation-weighted patent portfolio share of term-extended patents leads {{to an increase in}} cash flow by 1. 5 percent of book assets. Given these windfall profits, I find evidence of physical capital investment, debt issuance reduction, and acquisitions of new external technologies. Internal investments in R&D, on the other hand, show no response, suggesting high R&D adjustment costs for large, mature firms. In the second chapter, I find that being connected to directors who are or had been board members at bankrupt firms at the time of bankruptcy filing limits the efficacy of business networks in searching for directorships. Assuming that corporate bankruptcies can weaken interpersonal ties among directors, I exploit a quasi-natural experiment to investigate the degree to which director turnover is dependent on professional connections forged from current and past board memberships. By comparing directors who are indirectly linked to bankruptcy-filing firms through their professional networks to those without this indirect link, I find that a director's chances of finding additional directorships within a 1 -year period are lowered by over 10 percent on average after losing a set of connections due to corporate bankruptcies. This decline in director mobility is concentrated mostly among highly central directors and directors with board positions at firms with high G-Index measures, suggesting that the dependency on personal ties is stronger among firms with weak shareholder rights. In the third chapter, we explore the proxy voting patterns of <b>passive</b> mutual <b>funds.</b> We find that <b>passive</b> <b>funds</b> disagree with <b>management</b> more frequently than active funds within fund family. Additionally, voter efficacy between <b>passive</b> and active <b>funds</b> are not equal across agenda item categories...|$|R

30|$|Using a Switzerland-specific Carhart model, {{we study}} the {{risk-adjusted}} performance of actively and passively managed mutual funds investing in Swiss stocks from 1989 to 2007.

For a sample of 160 funds with 13, 672 monthly observations we find that active as well as <b>passive</b> <b>funds</b> significantly underperform indices on an aggregated basis. However, active large-cap funds significantly underperform and active Small&Mid-Cap-funds significantly outperform the index. Further, {{we find that the}} average manager of an active Swiss equity fund systematically overweights small-cap, value, and low-momentum stocks. When directly comparing active to <b>passive</b> <b>funds,</b> active funds significantly underperform by − 1.1 % p.a. on average. While active institutional funds can almost keep up with the performance of <b>passive</b> <b>funds,</b> active retail funds cannot and drive the substantial underperformance observed for active funds. Finally, active funds perform better before the millennium than thereafter. This robust result supports the hypothesis of ongoing efficiency increases in the Swiss stock market.|$|R
