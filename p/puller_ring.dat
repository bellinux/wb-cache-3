50|$|Despite {{official}} disapproval, the navaja de muelles {{became popular}} throughout Spain as a fighting and general utility knife, {{and was the}} primary personal arm of the Spanish guerrilleros who opposed Napoleon during his invasion and subsequent occupation of Spain in the Peninsular War of 1808-1814. Around 1850, a metal <b>pull</b> <b>ring</b> was incorporated into the lock to facilitate blade closure. <b>Pulling</b> the metal <b>ring</b> cammed the backspring upward, freeing the blade from its lock and allowing the blade to fold back into the handle. The <b>pull</b> <b>ring</b> was eventually discarded {{in favor of a}} low-profile metal lever.|$|R
5000|$|Next, the grenade's <b>pull</b> <b>ring</b> is grasped {{with the}} non-throwing hand while {{maintaining}} a firm grasp {{on the body of}} the grenade and safety lever (also referred to as the [...] "spoon") with the throwing hand. The <b>pull</b> <b>ring</b> and safety pin assembly are fitted so that a right-handed thrower can grasp the grenade with the fuse assembly on top and the safety lever held down by the right thumb. A left-handed thrower should grasp the grenade with the fuse assembly on the bottom and the safety lever held down by the left thumb.|$|R
50|$|The user {{then pulls}} the grenade and <b>pull</b> <b>ring</b> {{assembly}} apart, removing the safety pin from the fuse assembly. At this time, the fuse remains unfired, as the throwing hand's thumb {{is holding the}} safety lever down.|$|R
50|$|A pull string puppet is {{a puppet}} {{consisting}} of a cloth body where in the puppeteer puts his/her arm into a slot {{in the back and}} <b>pulls</b> <b>rings</b> on strings to make certain movements such as waving the arms or moving the mouth.|$|R

5000|$|Each {{fuse holder}} {{typically}} has an attached <b>pull</b> <b>ring</b> {{that can be}} engaged by a hook {{at the end of}} a fiberglass hot stick operated by a lineworker standing on the ground or from a bucket truck, to manually open the switch. While often used for switching, the standard cutout shown is not designed to be manually opened under load. For applications where the switch is likely to be used to interrupt power manually, a [...] "load break" [...] version is available that has an attachment to quench the arc.|$|R

60|$|Still she hesitated. Then an ugly, malevolent look {{came over}} her face, she <b>pulled</b> the <b>rings</b> from her fingers, and tossed them at him. One touched his face, the others hit his coat, and they {{scattered}} into the mud.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{to let me}} come {{sometimes}} while I wait, {{and wear}} this lest you should forget me," [...] he said, <b>pulling</b> a <b>ring</b> {{from his pocket and}} gently drawing a warm, bare hand out of the muff where it lay hidden.|$|R

50|$|To use a grenade, {{the soldier}} grips {{it with the}} {{throwing}} hand, ensuring that his thumb holds the safety lever in place; {{if there is a}} safety clip, it is removed prior to use. Left-handed soldiers are advised to invert the grenade, so the thumb is still the digit that holds the safety lever. The soldier then grabs the safety pin's <b>pull</b> <b>ring</b> with the index or middle finger of the other hand and removes it. He then throws the grenade towards the target. Soldiers are trained to throw grenades in standing, prone-to-standing, kneeling, prone-to-kneeling, and alternate prone positions and in under- or side-arm throws. If the grenade is thrown from a standing position the thrower must then immediately seek cover or lie prone if no cover is nearby.|$|R
5000|$|On the pilot's command, Levitow and the gunner began {{deploying}} flares {{through the}} open cargo door. Levitow set the timers and handed a flare to the gunner, who held it with his finger through the <b>pull</b> <b>ring</b> attached to the safety pin. Suddenly, Spooky 71 was jarred by a tremendous explosion. A North Vietnamese Army's 82-millimeter mortar shell hit the right wing and exploded inside the structure, raking the fuselage with flying shrapnel. Everyone {{in the back of}} Spooky 71 was wounded, including Levitow who was hit by shrapnel and concussion that he was quoted as saying [...] "felt like being hit by a two-by-four." [...] The blast also jarred the flare from the gunner's hands, pulling the safety pin from the canister as it did so and arming the fuse.|$|R
40|$|A 48 -year-old man accidently {{swallowed}} the <b>ring</b> <b>pull</b> from a soft drink can. He complained {{of pain in}} his chest. Chest radiographs were normal. A metal detector emitted a strong response when passed {{across the front of}} his chest. Oesophagoscopy was carried out and the <b>ring</b> <b>pull</b> was successfully removed. We recommend the wider use of metal detectors by accident and emergency (A&E) department staff particularly when dealing with patients who have ingested metals of low radiodensity...|$|R

50|$|In 1938, the Imperial Japanese Army {{copied the}} Chinese Type 23 and {{produced}} {{them at a}} Japanese factory in Manchuria. The design was designated as the 'Type 98'. Unlike both the original German Model 24 Stielhandgranate and the Type 23, the Type 98 was a fragmentation grenade. The charge, however, was weak and only contained 3 oz of picric acid (more powerful but less safe explosive than TNT). The weapon operated identically to the Type 23 on which it was based, except that a <b>pull</b> <b>ring</b> {{was attached to the}} igniting cord, and the actual fuse delay itself was reduced to four to five seconds (varying from grenade to grenade). Like the Type 23, however, it was simply a cheap crude design based off the Model 1924, and a number of issues plagued the Type 98's effectiveness.|$|R
5000|$|Released in 2010, the Nike Zoom KD III {{featured}} Flywire {{along the}} lateral forefoot with leather and woven mesh. The tongue featured a <b>pull</b> <b>ring,</b> {{surrounded by the}} letter [...] "d" [...] of the KD logo. Along the medial midfoot, an [...] "H" [...] shaped strap that has two eyelets positioned by column to provide support and lockdown fit. The midsole featured a Nike Zoom forefoot unit encased in lightweight Phylon midsole. The outsole featured a solid rubber outsole with a herringbone pattern. The heel has a cutaway to reveal the Phylon midsole in the outsole for compression. There is a solid rubber wrapped around the heel for durability, but most wearers found it uncomfortable for some reason that when the heel strikes the floor, the foot ends up hitting the rubber piece, which is hard.|$|R
50|$|The body {{is solid}} {{aluminium}} with a textured plastic coating {{made in the}} same form as the live grenade, the textured coating ensuring a good gripping surface. A hole drilled {{up from the bottom}} indicates an empty store as well as ensuring the drill grenade is of the same weight as a live grenade. A bushing on top of the grenade has a dummy fuze mechanism permanently attached with a slot for the <b>pull</b> <b>ring</b> to clip into to prevent it being accidentally pulled. The fuze mechanism, under the plastic cover is very similar in appearance to the American fuze mechanisms. Internally there is an extension on the striker to allow it to be re-cocked during training and there is a leaf spring safety that clips around the safety lever and neck of the grenade preventing the lever from rotating even if the safety pin is pulled.|$|R
5000|$|... de Havilland died on {{the evening}} of 27 September 1946 whilst {{carrying}} out high speed tests in the de Havilland DH 108 TG306 which broke up over the Thames estuary, the remains of the aircraft being discovered the following day in the mud of Egypt Bay, Gravesend, Kent. Found on the mud flats at Whitstable, his parachute <b>pull</b> <b>ring</b> untouched, the body of Captain de Havilland was found to have suffered a broken neck, the result of the aircraft having undergone severe and violent longitudinal oscillations prior to break-up, which caused de Havilland's head to strike the cockpit canopy with great force. Another pilot who flew the DH 108, Capt. Eric [...] "Winkle" [...] Brown, suggested that a factor in de Havilland's death was his height; Brown suffered similar oscillations during a test flight but, because of his shorter stature, they did not cause his head to contact the cockpit hood. The David Lean film The Sound Barrier is based upon this event.|$|R

30|$|The IFT between {{crude oil}} and aqueous {{solutions}} {{was measured using}} the ring method with a Sigma 700 force tensiometer. All measurements were performed in ambient conditions. Brine and crude oil {{were added to the}} device, and the IFT was measured. In this method, a platinum ring is held at the interface of water and oil. The force required to <b>pull</b> the <b>ring</b> out of the interface is related to the IFT.|$|R
50|$|Scappata ("run"). This is {{the start}} of every doppio. The bells, which are in resting {{position}} (mouth downward) are pulled with ropes tied to the goat. The clapper may be pushed away or <b>pulled</b> to <b>ring</b> the bell when the rotation is not sufficient. This phase ends when all the bell ringers can rotate their bell through 360 degrees, stop it with the bell's mouth upward and continue changing direction after every rotation.|$|R
