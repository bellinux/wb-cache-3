40|$|The {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} yew mesophilla cells. The object of {{investigation is}} revelation of the seasonal and age dynamics of the ultrastructural organization of <b>plastidome</b> and chondriome in the mesophilla cells. The researchers have pioneered in studying {{the genesis of the}} <b>plastidome</b> and chondriome level chloroplasts and mitochondrions may be restored and revaling the processes of division, fusion and destruction of chloroplasts in a mature cell. The obatined investigation results may prove useful in solving the general problems of biogenesis of organellas and mechanisms of adaptation of cells to enviornmental conditionsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|By ultrathin serial sectioning, {{morphological}} and volumetric {{changes of}} the <b>plastidome</b> and chondriome have been observed in Euglena gracilis Z during bleaching in darkness with addition of sodium acetate to the culture medium. In order not to introduce any modification to the synchronization pattern during bleaching, green cells were previously grown photoauto-trophically on Cramer & Myers medium under continuous illumination and synchronized by temperature cycles. They were then cultivated (1) photoheterotrophically with sodium acetate added to the culture medium and (2) heterotrophically by keeping the culture in darkness. This regime allowed observation of the influence (1) of synchronization by temperature cycles and (2) of sodium acetate and darkness on the <b>plastidome</b> and chondriome of photoautotrophic cells synchronized by light-dark cycles as described previously. In photoautotrophic cells, the <b>plastidome,</b> consisting of about ten diskoidal chloroplasts, occupies 15 % of the cell volume. The chondriome, {{in the form of}} one single giant mitochondrion branched throughout the cell, represents 6 % of the cell volume. The synchronization by temperature cycles in continuous illumination does not change the morphology and volume of these organelles. However, pyrenoids disappear. In photohetero...|$|E

Tissue ditferentiation and changes of plastid functions {{in the course of}} embryogenesis and plant development underlie the histological differentiation of plastids and their ontogenic transformations (metamorphosis) ...|$|E
40|$|Micromorphological {{investigations}} on the terpene-producing trichomes at {{the active}} secretory stage {{were performed on}} leaves and flowers of the Mexican Salvia greggii A. Gray (Lamiaceae), cultivated in Italy. Two types of glandular trichomes are described and compared: peltate, widespread on both the vegetative and the reproductive organs, and medium-stalked capitate, typical of the calyx abaxial side. The histochemical evidences indicate an exclusive terpene production for both morphotypes. TEM survey highlighted several common ultrastructural features that validated the light microscope observations, however a great variability was detected at the <b>plastidome</b> level. Different plastid populations characterized each trichome type, also {{in relation to the}} different distribution pattern on the plant epidermis. In the peltates plastids invariably displayed a well-developed internal membrane system and various types of osmiophilic inclusions: on the leaf and the calyx plastoglobuli were also observed, whereas on the corolla abundant starch grains. True leucoplast are only detected in the calyx capitate trichomes. 49 compounds were detected in the essential oil (EO) obtained from the aerial parts, with terpenes representing 98. 76...|$|E
40|$|When green {{cells of}} Euglena gracilis, strain Z, were light-grown {{for several months}} on a solid medium {{containing}} an excess of sodium acetate (1 - 0 % instead of the normal 0 1 %), some 30 % of the cells were colourless. The 'acetate-bleached ' organisms, isolated by plating methods and subsequently incubated in the light in a liquid medium, regained the capacity to form chlorophyll {{in a few days}} {{in the absence of any}} organic carbon source, and within 1 - 2 weeks in the presence of 0 - 1 % acetate. A number of bleached colonies, however, gave rise to populations in which the delay in pigment synthesis initiation was at least 2 months. Besides numerous paramylum granules and lipid inclusions, the acetate-bleached cells exhibited variably shaped and sized plastids, apparently lacking in ribosomes and showing a deeply disor-ganized membrane system. In the alga greened in the presence of 0 - 1 % acetate, the pattern of <b>plastidome</b> reorganization was altered; the thylakoids were often unpaired and vesiculated in dif-ferent degrees, owing primarily to the swelling of the lumen. A complete recovery of normal chloroplast structure occurred only after several weeks of exponential growth. The entire population greened in the absence of acetate constantly showed normal chloroplasts with perfectly reassociated thylakoids and clear partitions...|$|E
