500|$|Bryan Singer {{first read}} Apt Pupil {{when he was}} 19 years old, and {{when he became a}} director, he wanted to adapt the novella into a film. In 1995, Singer asked his friend and screenwriter Brandon Boyce to write a spec script {{adapting}} the novella. [...] Boyce recalled the writing process, [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} stageplay, actually... two people, <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> a house talking. [...] My script was completely on spec, so, if it didn't work out, at least I'd have a writing sample." [...] When the original option to the novella expired in 1995, Stephen King sued to get the rights back. Singer and Boyce then provided to King a first draft of their script and a copy of Singer's film The Usual Suspects (1995), which had yet to be publicly released. Impressed with Singer, King optioned the rights to the director for $1, arranging to be compensated when the film was released. Singer said of King's ultimate response to the film, despite some changes made to the source material, [...] "Stephen loved it. He seemed to think I captured the mood of the piece." [...] The director appreciated being able to make a Stephen King horror film but with less supernatural terror and more character-driven terror. Singer spoke of his goal: [...] "There have been a lot of fun horror movies like Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream, and I Know What You Did Last Summer. But I miss movies like The Shining, The Exorcist, and The Innocents by Jack Clayton, so this is a movie sort of in the spirit of the real horror movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|... (12 June 2008) We {{completed}} our 2008 {{effort to}} get definitive evidence for ivorybills in the Choctawhatchee River Basin in early May…. Team members had no sightings of ivorybills and only two sound detections in 2008.… So where does all this leave us? <b>Pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> {{the same position as}} in June 2006. We have a large body of evidence that Ivory-billed Woodpeckers persist along the Choctawhatchee River in the Florida panhandle, but we do not have definitive proof that they exist. Either the excitement of the ivorybill hunt causes competent birders to see and hear things that do not exist and leads competent sound analysts to misidentify hundreds of recorded sounds, or the few ivorybills in the Choctawhatchee River Basin are among the most elusive birds on the planet.|$|E
