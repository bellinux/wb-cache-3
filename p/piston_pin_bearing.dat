5000|$|In 1977, Buick {{redesigned}} the crankshaft to a [...] "split-pin" [...] configuration {{to create}} an [...] "even-firing" [...] version. The crank pins associated with the opposing cylinders were offset from each other by 30°. The relatively small offset did not require flying arms to be incorporated, however a 3.0 mm thick flange was built in between the offset crank pins to prevent the connecting rod big-ends from [...] "walking" [...] off the crank <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> journal and interfering with the adjacent big end. The 3.0 mm thick flange effectively caused the connecting rods on the left-hand bank of cylinders (forward bank for FWD applications) to move 3.0 mm forward relative to the right-hand bank, but the engine block remained unchanged compared to the odd-fire engine. Since the cylinders center-lines were no longer centralized over the crank <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> journals, the connecting rods were re-designed with the big-ends offset from the <b>piston</b> <b>pin</b> ends by 1.5 mm. The engine in this configuration became known to have [...] "off-centre bore spacing".|$|R

Therefore, for <b>piston</b> <b>pin</b> design several aspects are important. Among them are function, cost, NVH, fuel economy, durability, and impact on other design aspects of the engine. Continuously contacting with <b>piston</b> <b>pin,</b> the face of connecting rod, brings about abnormal wear such as unfairwear or earlywear. because the engine get more powered and one requirement for a good fuel economy is to achieve a low level of mechanical friction.

As the engine stroke is increased {{in the example}} above, the 402 cubic inch (6.6 l) configuration would place the piston 0.21 in (0.53 cm) higher in the cylinder at top dead center, and with a distance of 9.585 in (24.36 cm) from crankshaft main centerline to deck, the piston would protrude about 0.21 in (0.53 cm) higher than the top deck, or would collide with the cylinder head combustion chamber.
