40|$|In a {{cryogenic}} fluid, {{the sliding}} of polymers over a metallic surface {{is governed by}} adhesion more than by deformation phenomena. Polyimide resins and fluorinated resins submerged into a cryogenic fluid exhibit a noticeable increase of hardness which induces a decrease of the friction coefficient and of the wear rate compared to a sliding process performed in ambient air. The decrease of wear and friction coefficient is linked to adhesive and deformation phenomena. For fluorinated resins a cold flow is observed. This behavior is illustrated and quantified from test results. <b>Polychlorotrifluorethylene</b> and polyimide resins are characterized. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The use of Auger {{electron}} spectroscopy (AES) {{to search}} for transferred polymer must contend {{with the fact that}} there has been no published work on Auger analysis of polymers. Since this is a new area for AES, the Auger spectra of polymers and of halogenated polymers in particular is discussed. It is shown that the Auger spectra of halogenated polymers have certain characteristics that permit an assessment of whether a polymeric transfer film has been established by sliding contact. The discussion is general and the concepts should be useful in considering the Auger analysis of any polymer. The polymers chosen for this study are the halogenated polymers polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and <b>polychlorotrifluorethylene</b> (PCTFE) ...|$|E
