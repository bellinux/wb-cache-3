40|$|Negotiating intersections is {{a complex}} driving task that is {{particularly}} difficult for older drivers. This task requires accurate coordination of multiple driving subtasks, placing high demands on perception, attention and motor control that are known to decline with age.

The older drivers performed most of their steering while standing still instead of while accelerating as younger drivers do. This shift from <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>serial</b> control is a compensatory solution that drivers employ in response to age related decline in perception, cognition, and motor control abilities.

Serial links in network on chip provide many advantages in terms of crosstalk, skew, area cost, clock synchronization, and wiring difficulty when compared <b>to</b> multi-bit <b>parallel</b> data transmission. The proposed a novel coding technique reduces the number of transitions and hence reduces transmission energy on the serial wire. Also low power consumption is achieved by using the mux-tree based round robin scheduler.
