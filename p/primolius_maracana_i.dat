50|$|The {{blue-winged macaw}} (<b>Primolius</b> <b>maracana),</b> in aviculture more {{commonly}} known as Illiger's macaw, is a species of macaw found {{in central and eastern}} South America. It was previously placed in the genus Ara or Propyrrhura. Blue-winged macaws have been known to reach an age of 50-60 years.|$|R
50|$|The {{area for}} the natural {{monument}} is semi-arid, with typical caatinga vegetation, and subject to desertification.It has sandstone formations {{more than a billion}} years old, which have their own flora and endemic species.These include the endangered blue-winged macaw (<b>Primolius</b> <b>maracana)</b> and a newly reported skink of the Mabuya genus.|$|R
50|$|A {{census of}} birds from October 2005 to December 2006 {{recorded}} 226. Another 68 {{species have been}} reported by other authors, making a total of 293 in the ESEC. Many were endemic to the Atlantic Forest of cerrado, and some were endangered {{in the state of}} São Paulo.The blue-winged macaw (<b>Primolius</b> <b>maracana)</b> is considered vulnerable.|$|R
5000|$|... 346 {{bird species}} have been recorded, {{although}} some are dubious.Species include bare-faced curassow (Crax fasciolata), blue-winged macaw (<b>Primolius</b> <b>maracana),</b> blue-bellied parrot (Triclaria malachitacea), red-spectacled amazon (Amazona pretrei), purple-winged ground dove (Claravis geoffroyi), Temminck's seedeater (Sporophila falcirostris), Brazilian merganser (Mergus octosetaceus), grey-bellied hawk (Accipiter poliogaster), harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and canebrake groundcreeper (Clibanornis dendrocolaptoides).The park is an important site for conserving the black-fronted piping guan (Pipile jacutinga) in Argentina.|$|R
50|$|The varied {{relief and}} flora support a very diverse bird {{population}} and favour endemism.The white-banded mockingbird (Mimus triurus) {{passes through the}} reserve from June to August.409 species are known {{to occur in the}} reserve including the threatened hyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus), Chaco eagle (Buteogallus coronatus), red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus) and blue-winged macaw (<b>Primolius</b> <b>maracana).</b> There are 22 regionally endemic species including red-throated piping guan (Pipile cujubi), snow-capped manakin (Lepidothrix nattereri) and masked tanager (Tangara nigrocincta).Rare species include the Tapajós hermit (Phaethornis aethopygus), bald parrot (Pyrilia aurantiocephala) and the chorozinho-do-cachimbo, a recently discovered species of Herpsilochmus.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} bird {{records from the}} little studied Bragantina region, in the densely {{populated}} Northeastern Amazon. This region was a center of human colonization in the last century, resulting in the nearly complete replacement of rainforests by a dynamic, mosaic-like rural landscape pattern. From February 1999 to January 2001, I surveyed birds at three sites: a 25 -ha smallholding farm, and around two small lakes, in the municipality of Igarapé-Açu. Bird species were recorded along 36 days during an agricultural experiment. As would be expected, species lists from these sites show reduced bird diversity in comparison to primary forests. They also reveal a preponderance of robust, widespread generalists, such as Crotophaga ani (Linnaeus, 1758), Ramphocelus carbo (Pallas, 1764), and Columbina passerina (Linnaeus, 1758). However, endemic Xipholena lamellipennis (Lafresnaye, 1839), Tachybaptus dominicus (Linnaeus, 1766), and <b>Primolius</b> <b>maracana</b> (Vieillot, 1816) (high count of 34 at one time), were also observed. In all, 110 bird species (representing 95 genera and 40 families) are listed with information about abundance and habitat. More detailed surveys of this region are recommended, which should focus on gallery forests that might serve as refuges for some forest species...|$|R

So much so {{that all}} come from a DVD {{recorded}} in my home, very intimate, {{so far from the}} proportions of the <b>Maracana.</b> <b>I</b> see the new work as a great challenge - to be in Madison, being in New York because it is an important step in my international career, important for my career in Brazil.

"You have no {{idea what}} an amazing concert, with great musicians, production, staff, lighting, sound, the band, {{everything}} is impressive.":—Anahí talking about the live concert DVD recorded at the Maracanã Stadium. In 2006, RBD band member Anahí confirmed the recording of the live concert DVD at the Maracanã Stadium, stating: [...] "Imagine our excitement, RBD will record their new live album in the <b>Maracanã</b> Stadium. <b>I</b> think it is a gift for the people who truly love us, plus I have so much faith in that concert and very soon {{you will be able to}} see it (in DVD) so you can see what happened." ...|$|R
5000|$|At the 1962 World Cup in Chile, {{instead of}} turning the {{situation}} to his team's advantage, Popluhár brought the referee's attention to the injured Pelé. In 1997, {{he was awarded the}} World Fair Play award for this sporting act. [...] "I met Pelé several times, the first occasion in Chile and then in various international and club games. He was undoubtedly the best, but there were not many one-to-one situations he won and also not many Slovak players who scored in the famous <b>Maracana</b> stadium. <b>I</b> belong to this lucky group after I scored with a free kick against Brazil in June 1966", he remembers.|$|R
