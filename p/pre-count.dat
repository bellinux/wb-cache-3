For three days prior to launch, the astronaut went through a special diet to minimize his need for defecating during the flight. On the morning of the trip he typically ate a steak breakfast. After having sensors applied to his body and being dressed in the pressure suit, he started breathing pure oxygen to prepare him for the atmosphere of the spacecraft. He arrived at the launch pad, took the elevator up the launch tower and entered the spacecraft two hours before launch. Once the astronaut was secured inside, the hatch was bolted, the launch area evacuated and the mobile tower rolled back. After this, the launch vehicle was filled with liquid oxygen. The entire procedure of preparing for launch and launching the spacecraft followed a time table called the countdown. It started a day in advance with a <b>pre-count,</b> in which all systems of the launch vehicle and spacecraft were checked. After that followed a 15-hour hold, during which pyrotechnics were installed. Then came the main countdown which for orbital flights started 6½ hours before launch (T – 390 min), counted backwards to launch (T = 0) and then forward until orbital insertion (T + 5 min).|$|E

The aim of this study was to provide a new accurate and affordable method for the establishment of breast cancer xenograftin nude mice. Injectable estradiol valerate was assayed as a substitute for estradiol pellets that are rather expensive in order to create cancer tumors by MCF 7 xenograft method in nude mice (B 6). Twenty four healthy adult female nude mice (B 6) were injected with different concentrations of <b>pre-counted</b> MCF 7 cells. Then estradiol valerate and Matrigel B.

In a period of 6 to 9 weeks, mice injected with increased amount of MCF 7 cells, estradiol valerate and Matrigel (combined or alone) developed faster and larger tumors than animals which received MCF 7 only or MCF 7 and Matrigel combined. The results indicate that estradiol valerate which is way less expensive than estradiol pellets can be used as tumor proliferator to create animal breast cancer models...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{a set of}} reference counts applied to multiparameter <b>pre-counts</b> in blood donors. Aim: Analyse the impact of pre-donation counts and specific reference intervals on donors' management. Background: Multiparameter blood counts allow an improved enrolment process of blood donors due to a prompt identification of abnormalities involving haemoglobin (Hb), white blood cells (WBC) and platelets (PLT). Methods/Materials: Multiple pre-donation capillary counts were applied in the enrolment process of 13 347 consecutive donors. The rate of specific alterations of permanent exclusion and donor readmittance to donations for temporary exclusion had been evaluated, applying a set of multiparameter reference intervals. Results: Alterations involved Hb in 72. 55 % of cases, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in 20. 99 %, total WBC in 9. 39 %, lymphocytes in 7. 55 % and PLT in 6. 07 %. Among donors with initial alterations (543; 4. 06 %), 12. 70 % were readmitted to donations within 15 days, 14. 36 % had permanent exclusion, 36. 83 % underwent prompt supplementation treatment and 36. 09 % were lost at follow-up or refused treatments. Discussion: The systematic use of blood count reference intervals and pre-donation multiparameter blood counts allowed prompt identification of WBC, PLT and MCV alterations, readmittance within 15 days of 12. 70 % of initially excluded donors and contributed to prompt management of supplement deficiency...|$|R
40|$|When {{exploring}} the mechanisms involved in perceiving numbers we must distinguish between {{two types of}} numbers: subset numbers (e. g., perceiving " 2 " when two plates and one cup are displayed on a table) and {{the total number of}} items (e. g., perceiving " 3 " objects in the previous example). Combining feature perception theories with number perception theories, the current paper explores the mechanisms involved in the perception of small numbers in feature-defined subsets. The paper introduces several theories for how subset items can be represented and examines an important prediction of those theories: Will the number of distractors affect the perception of small subset items? In two experiments, we found that the response time (RT) for counting small target items that differ from their distractors by a single feature was faster when there were few distractors compared to many distractors. This was found for different types of distractors: distractors within and outside the subitizing range. Only when distractors were organized in a specific pattern, allowing distractor grouping, {{the increase in the number}} of distractors did not affect target counting. The current study suggests that even when performing simple counting of subset targets, the enumeration process can begin only once the locations of the targets have been identified and the targets' shape is bound to these locations. This <b>pre-counting</b> procedure depends on the number of individual locations occupied by the distractors. These findings are further discussed within the context of the object file theory...|$|R

5000|$|Cowan {{also noted}} {{a number of}} other limits of {{cognition}} that point to a [...] "magical number four", and different from Miller, he argued that this correspondence is no coincidence. One other process that seems to be limited at about four elements is subitizing, the rapid enumeration of small numbers of objects. When a number of objects are flashed briefly, their number can be determined very quickly, at a glance, when the number does not exceed the subitizing limit, which is about four objects. Larger numbers of objects must be counted, which is a slower process. The film Rain Man portrayed an autistic savant, who was able to rapidly determine the number of toothpicks from an entire box spilled on the floor, apparently subitizing a much larger number than four objects. A similar feat was informally observed by neuropsychologist Oliver Sacks and reported in his book The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. Therefore, one might suppose that this limit is an arbitrary limit imposed by our cognition rather than necessarily being a physical limit. (On the other hand, autism expert Daniel Tammet has suggested that the children Sacks observed may have <b>pre-counted</b> the matches in the box.). There is also evidence that even four chunks is a high estimate: Gobet and Clarkson conducted an experiment and found that over half of the memory recall conditions yielded only about two chunks. Research also shows that the size, rather than the number, of chunks that are stored in short-term memory is what allows for enhanced memory in individuals.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} an evolutionary model of eating disorders. More specifically, this study tested Riadh Abed 2 ̆ 7 s Sexual Competition Theory of Eating Disorders (1998). This theory postulates that eating disorders arise through female intra-sexual competition for males. Specifically, females wish to present themselves as evolutionarily desirable to males (physically attractive, thin), causing some individuals to develop restrained eating patterns. This is important, as restraint is a precursor to disordered eating. Restraint refers to replacing internally regulated (hunger driven) eating with planned, cognitively determined eating or dietary restraint with the goal of weight loss or preventing weight gain. According to Abed 2 ̆ 7 s model, single women who have not yet found a mate are expected to eat less. Furthermore, because restrained eaters are more weight schematic, single restrained women are expected to eat even less. The hypotheses put forward were that all females would eat less in the presence of a desirable than in the presence of an undesirable potential mate, single females would eat less than committed females, and restrained, single females will eat the least of all groups. A total of 130 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to be exposed to descriptions of either two evolutionarily desirable mates or two evolutionarily undesirable mates. Participants were asked to choose between the two different mates and were given a bowl of <b>pre-counted,</b> pre-weighed M 2 ̆ 6 Ms to snack on during this procedure. Results revealed a two-way interaction where single women who were exposed to the evolutionarily desirable mate ate the least amount of M 2 ̆ 6 Ms. Contrary to expectations, restrained eaters ate more than unrestrained eaters.

40|$|Introduction Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{familiar}} and congruent spokes-characters increase young children’s preference for healthy snacks (De Droog, Valkenburg, & Buijzen, 2010; De Droog, Buijzen, Opree, & Valkenburg, 2011; De Droog, Buijzen, & Valkenburg, 2012, De Droog, Buijzen, & Valkenburg, 2014). However, few studies have examined the impact of endorser-type on children’s relative preference for healthy over unhealthy foods and actual food consumption. Therefore, the purpose of this experiment was to investigate which type of endorsing character is superior in increasing young children’s (4 - 6 years old) relative preference for an endorsed healthy snack (mini-carrots) compared to a similar, yet unendorsed unhealthy snack (candy carrots). Prior experiments testing the processing fluency theory have shown that familiar and congruent marketing stimuli facilitate consumers’ advertising processing, which arouses positive affect that transfers to the brand (e. g. De Vries & Van Rompay, 2009; Reber, et al., 1998; Van Rompay, et al., 2010). Consequently, it was expected that children’s preference for, and consumption of a healthy snack over a similar unhealthy snack would significantly increase when the healthy snack is endorsed by familiar and/or congruent characters. Method These hypotheses were investigated using a 2 (mini-carrots vs candy carrots) x 2 (familiar vs unfamiliar endorser) x 2 (congruent vs incongruent endorser) x 2 (exposure-order) mixed design. The children were asked to evaluate both the mini- and candy carrots. The healthy snack consisted of sliced carrots presented in a transparent packaging featuring a sticker of one of the following pretested characters (N = 20) : Bobo the rabbit (familiar/congruent), Cars (boys) and Dora The Explorer (girls) (familiar/incongruent), an unfamiliar rabbit (congruent), and an unfamiliar monkey (incongruent). The unhealthy snack consisted of candy carrots presented in an unendorsed transparent packaging. The data were collected in 11 Dutch elementary schools during February and March 2015. A sample of 250 Dutch children between 4 and 6 years old were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the eight conditions (N = 250, 57 % girls, Mage = 4. 93, SD = 0. 76). The children were individually shown pictures of the different character-food combinations on a tablet. The healthy snack (mini-carrots) featured one of the endorsing characters, whereas the unhealthy snack (candy carrots) remained unendorsed. Children’s food liking and pester intentions were assessed using smiley-scales. After completing the online questionnaire, the children were ‘rewarded’ with two identical bowls filled with an equal amount of <b>pre-counted</b> sliced carrots and candy carrots. Children’s consumption was assessed by counting the amount of carrots eaten per child. Results A mixed ANCOVA was conducted with food liking as the dependent within-subjects variable, character-familiarity, character-congruence, and gender as between-participant factors, and age and level of hunger as covariates. Against expectations, the main effects of food type, character-familiarity, and character-congruence were not significant. The analysis revealed a significant negative relation between age and food liking (F(1, 242) = 5. 1, p =. 025; b = -. 62, p =. 004) for actual carrot slices, but not for candy carrots. With regard to pester intent, the main effect of food type was significant F(1, 239) = 4. 39, p =. 037). Children’s pester intentions were higher for candy carrots compared to carrot slices (Mcarrots = 2. 3, SD = 0. 91; Mcandy-carrots= 2. 35, SD =. 82, range = 1 - 3). Older children reported significantly lower pester intentions for carrot slices compared to younger children (F(1, 239) = 7. 06, p =. 008; b= -. 27, p = <. 0001). With regard to children’s actual carrot consumption, the mixed ANCOVA showed that children’s consumption did not differ significantly between actual carrots and candy carrots (F(1, 238) =. 55, p =. 461). However, the between-subjects effect of character-congruence was significant (F(1, 238) = 8. 48, p =. 004). Children ate significantly more carrots overall when the endorsing character was conceptually congruent (Mcongruent =. 56, SD =. 16, Mincongruent =. 49, SD =. 19, Mdiff = -. 064, SE =. 022, 95 % CI [- 1. 07 - -. 021]). Conclusion Against expectations, results revealed that pairing familiar and/or conceptually congruent endorsing characters with a healthy snack did not increase young children’s liking of, pester intentions for, and consumption of a healthy snack relative to a similar unendorsed, unhealthy snack. Overall, children consumed more carrots when the healthy carrot slices were endorsed by a matching character. These findings suggest that employing endorsing characters in order to increase children’s preference for healthy foods might actually backfire by stimulating children’s general snacking behavior.

Shifts in population distribution were significantly influenced by sample period and interactions between sample period and location of the plot, canopy level and treatment. Visual comparisons before and after trials indicated that small dips in population and random shifts in canopy population distribution quickly returned to original levels after the application of rainfall. An in-field aphid observational study indicated that some abiotic factors associated with rainstorm events are conditionally significant.
