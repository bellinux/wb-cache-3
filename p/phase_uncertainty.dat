40|$|In {{this paper}} the <b>phase</b> <b>uncertainty</b> or phase error of a sampled {{quantizer}} is examined. <b>Phase</b> <b>uncertainty</b> {{results from a}} limited accuracy of detection of the level crossings, as the input signal generally crosses the quantization levels in between sample moments.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{analyze the}} effects of {{uncertainty}} in the phase of speech signals on the word recognition error rate of human listeners. The motivating {{goal is to get}} a quantitative measure on the importance of phase in automatic speech recognition by studying {{the effects of}} <b>phase</b> <b>uncertainty</b> on human perception. Listening tests were conducted for 18 listeners under different <b>phase</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. These results indicate that a small amount of phase error or uncertainty does not affect the recognition rate, but a large amount of <b>phase</b> <b>uncertainty</b> significantly affects the recognition rate. The degree of the importance of phase also seems to be an SNR-dependent one, such that at lower SNRs the effects of <b>phase</b> <b>uncertainty</b> are more pronounced than at higher SNRs. For example, at an SNR of IH dB, having random phases at all frequencies results in a word error rate (WER) of 63 % compared to 24 % if the phase was unaltered. In comparison, at 0 dB, random phase results in a 25 % WER as compared to 11 % for the unaltered phase case. Listening tests were also conducted for the case of reconstructed phase based on the least square error estimation approach [11]. The results indicate that the recognition rate for the reconstructed phase case is very close to that of the perfect phase case (a WER difference of 4 % on average).

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the modelling and estimation of frequency and <b>phase</b> carrier <b>uncertainties</b> in an array system where its elements are distributed over a large area and consequently forming large aperture arrays with massive inter-element spacings. In this situation, it is practically impossible to have a common carrier (common local oscillator - LO) in order to form a fully coherent array system, {{as in the case of}} small aperture arrays where the array elements are in the vicinity of each other. Instead, each of the receiving array elements has its own independent carrier which will have slightly different frequencies and phases, even if the local oscillators are using similar hardware or even if each local oscillator is using a GPS reference clock for locking. These discrepancies will introduce frequency and <b>phase</b> <b>uncertainties</b> in the array which must be removed to achieve a coherent array system. In this paper, these uncertainties are mathematically modelled, their effect on the performance of an array system is examined and a simple method is proposed to estimate and eliminate these uncertainties.
