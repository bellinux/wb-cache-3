5|$|In 1955-56, Ray was {{overlooked}} {{and spent}} four years out of first-class cricket, and he never played alongside Neil again at first-class level. Neil played in all of Victoria's matches, and Mick played in Queensland’s first six matches before being dropped for the second and final match against Victoria. In 1956-57, Mick played in two matches for Queensland {{earlier in the season}} before being dropped and retiring; neither were against Victoria, so none of the brothers <b>played</b> <b>together</b> in one match. Ray was recalled to the Victorian team {{in the latter half of}} the 1958-59 season. By this time, Neil had moved to New South Wales for employment reasons, and played each other late in the season. The Harvey brothers never <b>played</b> <b>together</b> or against one another again at first-class level. In 1959-60, Neil was in the Indian subcontinent representing Australia as Ray played his final first-class season before retiring.|$|E

5|$|Mehldau's first {{recording}} was for Hollyday's The Natural Moment in 1991; {{his first}} tour of Europe was {{also with the}} saxophonist that year. Mehldau's interest in classical music returned {{when he was in}} his early twenties, and spurred him into developing his left-hand playing. He led his own trio from at least 1992, when he played at New York's Village Gate. Mehldau also played as sideman with a variety of musicians around this time. His performances with saxophonist Perico Sambeat included a tour of Europe early in 1993, and Mehldau's first released recordings as co-leader, from a May concert in Barcelona. Mehldau also toured for 18 months with saxophonist Joshua Redman. This association began in 1993, but they had <b>played</b> <b>together</b> for a short period the previous year. Redman and his band attracted attention, with their 1994 album Moodswing also aiding Mehldau's profile. They also <b>played</b> <b>together</b> for the soundtrack to the 1994 film Vanya on 42nd Street, for which Redman wrote the music.|$|E
5|$|Mervyn Roye Harvey (29 April 1918 – 18 March 1995) was a cricketer {{who played}} in one Test match for Australia in 1947. His younger brother, Neil, was one of Australia's finest batsmen, and the pair <b>played</b> <b>together</b> for Victoria during {{the latter part of}} Merv's career.|$|E
5|$|The three {{brothers}} <b>played</b> <b>together</b> {{in the next}} match against Western Australia. Merv captained the team as Hassett was away on Test duty. Victoria batted first and Ray made only 1. In the second innings, Ray 15, not batting with his brothers in a drawn match.|$|E

5|$|While the {{brothers}} <b>played</b> <b>together</b> for Fitzroy {{on a regular}} basis, they only played first-class cricket together occasionally, mainly {{due to a lack}} of form and differences in age. Merv debuted for Victoria before the war, and Neil joined him in 1946-47. Ray followed in subsequent season, and the trio played in two matches together for their state. However, there were no occasions after this when more than two <b>played</b> <b>together</b> in the same match and such occurrences became more sporadic after this as Merv was dropped, while Neil was often away playing for Australia. Mick made his debut in 1948-49, but left Victoria at the end of the season after being unable to hold his position in the team, while Ray often struggled to gain regular selection except when Neil and the other Test players were representing Australia. Ray had a strong end to the 1952-53 season and was selected for all the matches in the following two seasons alongside Neil, but was then dropped.|$|E
5|$|Alston guided {{his teams}} {{to at least}} 85 wins per season between 1969 and 1976. They {{finished}} in second place in their division six times during that span. The team {{came very close to}} a pennant in 1971; after falling 11 games out of first place, the team performed well late in the season and finished one game behind the San Francisco Giants. Beginning in 1973, Alston's team featured an infield of Steve Garvey, Davey Lopes, Bill Russell and Ron Cey. The group <b>played</b> <b>together</b> for eight years, remaining together long after the end of Alston's tenure.|$|E

Cornell also joined Morello on stage on September 26, 2014, guesting on his solo Seattle show. They <b>played</b> <b>together</b> several Nightwatchman songs, Cornell's usual acoustic covers, and for the first time in eight years, some Audioslave songs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the return}} match against Queensland, Harvey made 17 as Victoria took a convincing innings win. In the next match against New South Wales, Harvey played with Neil {{for the first}} time at {{first-class}} level, and pair <b>played</b> <b>together</b> for their state’s two remaining matches of the season, although they never batted together as Merv was always out before Neil came in, usually at No. 6. Merv made 30 and 44, failing to capitalise on his starts to make a big score with a Test vacancy beckoning; incumbent opener Sid Barnes was injured and unavailable for the Fourth Test.|$|E

5|$|Through the mid-1980s, Lutosławski {{composed}} {{three pieces}} called Łańcuch ("Chain"), {{which refers to}} the way the music is constructed from contrasting strands which overlap like the links of a chain.

5|$|After an {{exhibition}} rout of US Armed Forces, the Lady Vols {{opened up the}} season unusually, with a conference game against Mississippi. Semeka Randall did not start the game. However, four minutes into the game, the Lady Vols were only up 4–2. At this point, Randall was put into the game, and Tennessee scored fifteen straight, on a run fueled by her. Randall scored 24, and star Chamique Holdsclaw added 23. This season opener has {{caused a lot of}} anticipation, as it was expected that this would be the game where all four of Tennessee's freshman <b>played</b> <b>together.</b> However, during a November practice, Clement had injured her foot, resulting in a stress fracture. After a discussion with the team doctor, Clement agreed to sit out the Mississippi game {{in order to be able}} to play the next game, against Louisiana Tech.|$|E
5|$|Burnley's 30-game unbeaten streak {{during the}} 1920–21 season stood as a Football League record for 83 years {{until it was}} surpassed by Arsenal, who {{completed}} the entire season without losing in the 2003–04 campaign. After the defeat to Bradford City on 28 August 1920, Burnley did not lose another match at Turf Moor until 11 February 1922, when they were beaten 1–2 by Blackburn Rovers. In the same match, the halfback line of Tommy Boyle, George Halley and Billy Watson—used in 25 first-team games during 1920–21—was seen for the final time, having <b>played</b> <b>together</b> {{for the first time}} in September 1913. The majority of the championship-winning team remained intact going into the 1921–22 season, although players such as David Taylor and Walter Weaver found themselves less involved in first-team matches.|$|E
5|$|Each {{player was}} {{acquired}} by the Canucks through various trades. Once each member arrived in Vancouver it took {{two years before the}} line <b>played</b> <b>together</b> regularly. Once they did, they helped to set a Canucks franchise record for points in 2002–03 season (later surpassed), a season in which the West Coast Express accounted for 45% of the team's goal production. All three players recorded their most individually recognized and best statistical seasons while playing on the line. Despite regular season success, the Canucks were never able to advance past {{the second round of the}} playoffs during the West Coast Express years. The line was disbanded when Bertuzzi was traded to the Florida Panthers after the 2005–06 season. Both Morrison and Naslund played through the 2007–08 season with the Canucks before leaving the organization via free agency.|$|E
