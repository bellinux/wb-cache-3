40|$|Abstract: Wound rotor {{induction}} motors {{have been}} popular for {{decades in the}} cement and mining industry for starting and driving large grinding mill. A wound rotor induction motor is large ac motor that controlled starting characteristics and adjustable speed capability. Slip power recovery wound rotor induction motor drives are used in high power, limited speed range applications where control of slip power provides the variable speed drive system. Traditional method of speed control of slip ring induction motor is variable resistance method but losses occurs are more. So, in this paper rotor resistance method and slip power recovery system {{is used for the}} speed control of slip-ring induction motor and analysis of speed and power loss is carried out. MATLAB/Simulink is used to simulate this both method for slip-ring induction motor and <b>prove</b> that in <b>rotor</b> resistance method speed control is possible but the system loss is increase whereas in slip power recovery system by change in firing angle of inverter we can change speed of motor and save power which is loss in resistance...|$|R
40|$|Shipping is the {{lifeline}} of the Pacific. All current sea-transport {{options are}} fossil fuel powered and increasingly unsustainable. Globally, {{a range of}} renewable energy technologies is emerging with application in commercial shipping, including wind, solar and bio- fuels/gases. Such technologies have, to date, received little attention {{in the development of}} alternative energy solutions for Oceania, despite transport being the largest user of fossil fuels by Pacific Island Countries (PICs) and exploration of appropriate technologies for PIC sea-transport is currently embryonic. Anton Flettner invented and <b>proved</b> the Flettner <b>Rotor</b> that utilises the Magnus effect for propulsion in the 1920 s as an effective method of reducing fuel use and increasing ship stability for commercial blue water shipping. The then low cost of fossil fuels and the emerging diesel ship propulsion engineering did not see the idea progress past the initial prototypes. The technology was briefly revisited in the 1980 s. In the past decade a number of leading shipping designers and researchers have begun seriously re- investigating modern application of Flettner technology with impressive results. This technical review documents the literature of this technology to make it available to researchers seeking potential means for reducing Oceanic shipping costs for both transport and fishing at all levels of vessel size...|$|R
40|$|The {{rotating}} instability {{phenomenon is}} investigated experimentally on a laboratory low-speed axial fan. Unsteady pressure measurements are performed {{close to the}} rotor leading edge, in the far-field in the upstream-duct section, and within the rotating frame by using Kulite sensors near the blade tip. As reference, the occurrence of rotating instability is <b>proven</b> for a <b>rotor</b> configuration with large clearance size. Existing explanations assume that rotating instability is induced by the tip clearance vortex. Following these models, the characteristic spectral and modal signatures of rotating instability are generated by the circumferentially coupled unsteady vortex systems within the individual blade passages. However, some early findings on a shrouded rotor setup and a study on an annular cascade without clearance have {{raised questions about the}} validity of the existing theories. To answer these questions, a second configuration is investigated using the identical rotor in a shrouded version. Here, a shrouding band covers the blade tips over the whole circumference. By using a comprehensive sensor arrangement in a wide variation of operating conditions, the existence of spectral and modal rotating instability signatures is proven on the shrouded-rotor configuration, as well. In this case, the tip clearance vortex system and, respectively, the leakage flow are suppressed. The present study underlines that novel explanations are required to describe the physical mechanism that generates rotating instability...|$|R
40|$|The {{destabilizing}} {{influence of}} the internal friction on the supercritical rotor whirl can be efficiently counterbalanced by other external dissipative sources and/or anisotropic suspension systems. The theoretical approach may take the internal dissipation into consideration either by dry or viscous models. Nevertheless, several numerical results and a new perturbation technique of the averaging type <b>prove</b> that similar <b>rotor</b> motions and stability limits are achievable by both models, whence the linear viscous assumption appears preferable. Thus, the internal hysteretic force may be expressed by {{the product of an}} equivalent viscous coefficient and the rotor centre velocity relative to a reference frame rotating with the shaft end sections. After calculating the natural frequencies and the response to dynamic imbalances, the stability of the steady motion is checked by the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, focusing the analysis on the individual influence of several characteristic properties, like the gyro structure, the stiffness anisotropy of the supports and their asymmetry, and searching for the external damping level needed for stability. A fairly interesting result is that the benefit of the suspension anisotropy is most effective for a symmetric rotor mounted at the shaft mid-span and decreases significantly on increasing the configuration asymmetry, even moderately. It is also observed how the stability may somehow be associated with the coupling between progressive and retrograde recession motions...|$|R
40|$|Hydrokinetic turbines, {{targeting}} the kinetic energy of fast-flowing currents, are under development with some turbines already deployed at ocean {{sites around the}} world. It remains virtually unknown as to how these technologies affect fish, and rotor collisions have been postulated as a major concern. In this {{study the effects of}} a vertical axis hydrokinetic rotor with rotational speeds up to 70 rpm were tested on the swimming patterns of naturally occurring fish in a subtropical tidal channel. Fish movements were recorded with and without the rotor in place. Results showed that no fish collided with the rotor and only a few specimens passed through rotor blades. Overall, fish reduced their movements through the area when the rotor was present. This deterrent effect on fish increased with current speed. Fish that passed the rotor avoided the near-field, about 0. 3 m from the rotor for benthic reef fish. Large predatory fish were particularly cautious of the rotor and never moved closer than 1. 7 m in current speeds above 0. 6 ms- 1. The effects of the rotor differed among taxa and feeding guilds and it is suggested that fish boldness and body shape influenced responses. In conclusion, the tested hydrokinetic turbine <b>rotor</b> <b>proved</b> non-hazardous to fish during the investigated conditions. However, the results indicate that arrays comprising multiple turbines may restrict fish movements, particularly for large species, with possible effects on habitat connectivity if migration routes are exploited. Arrays of the investigated turbine type and comparable systems should therefore be designed with gaps o...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{covers a}} broad range of {{subjects}} pertaining to induction machines, faulty as well as healthy ones. Firstly, a completely new and unconventional methodology for deriving simplest possible, yet sufficiently accurate, mathematical models for induction machines with general electrical faults is presented. Examples of common faults covered are inter-turn short circuit and increased resistance in one or more stator phases. Some common rotor faults treated in the thesis are broken rotor bars and broken end rings. Another fault that is encompassed by the modeling approach is diminished air-gap in front of one or more stator and/or rotor phases. Although straightforward to consider, it is unlikely in practice that more than one fault would occur at a time. Therefore, the modeling technique is explicitly used for arriving at two different models, where it is assumed that there is an electrical fault in either one stator phase or in one rotor phase. Interestingly, complexity of the resulting models is comparable to that of conventional models for healthy induction machines. The two models are validated against data collected from real-life induction machines with faults on purpose imposed upon them, with excellent agreement between the simulated and measured signals. Secondly, system properties of the two derived models, such as dissipativity, observability and controllability, are analyzed. It is shown that neither a stator nor a rotor fault alters these system attributes, except for very special cases. Furthermore, when a healthy induction machine is subject to a constant load and a perfectly balanced stator voltage source, it is <b>proven</b> that the <b>rotor</b> speed cannot be stabilized if the voltage has a spectral content comprising more than two distinct frequencies. Thirdly, the two developed models are used for state and parameter estimation in induction machines. Two kinds of observers are designed. The first one aims at robust stator flux estimation for healthy induction machines. It is shown that exponential convergence of the estimation error can be guaranteed, at a rate independent of the rotor speed. Therefore, the design possesses robustness against disturbance in rotor speed measurements, however with an upper bound on attainable performance. The second observer methodology provides a generalized linear-quadratic optimal framework for linear complex-valued time-varying systems, where an arbitrary, possibly time-varying, guaranteed convergence rate can be assigned. The methodology is thereafter used in a new parameter estimation scheme, both for healthy induction machines and those subject to stator faults, in order to estimate all electrical parameters on-line, under very mild assumptions. Specifically, the scheme can be used for fault detection. Simulations validating the methodology are provided. Godkänd; 2006; 20061116 (pafi...|$|R
40|$|This study {{researches}} on the {{two types}} of dental handpiece provided by the medical manufacturer, and focus on analyzing their dynamic characteristics of internal rotor-bearing system. In the numerical analysis of rotor-bearing system, this paper uses the finite element method and takes the MATLAB design software as platform to complete the numerical analysis program for this rotor-bearing system. The system consists of elastic shaft, rigid disks and bearing which has damping and stiffness. During analyzing the shaft elements, the research will probe into the beam of Timoshenko. The model of the shaft element includes the effects of translation inertia, rotational inertia, gyroscopic moments, and shear deformations. In order to confirm the reliability of the analysis program, firstly, we calculate the critical speed of rotor - bearing system by using the finite element model, and compare to the literatures. Then we obtain critical speeds of Rotor-Kit by using the finite element mode, and further analyze the rotor-bearing system in dental handpiece. We draw the Campbell diagram, mode shape and the critical speed versus bearing stiffness diagram and get a trend of dynamic characteristics of rotor-bearing system in experiments. This finite-element analysis program on rotary-bearing system used in this department is verified in various scientific literatures and <b>proven</b> by many <b>rotor</b> tests. The error percentage is within one percent and it successfully illustrates the dynamic characteristics of the internal microscopic turbine rotor in the dental handpiece. Therefore, in designing this system the finite element method is very useful to precisely analyze the rotor in motion. The experimental data can be used as reference for future modification and refinement of the rotor-bearing system. And this finite-element analysis program {{can be used as a}} fundamental design tool for the system. 本研究是以市售醫療廠商所提供的 2
