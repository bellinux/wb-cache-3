40|$|Abstract: The {{main focus}} of our {{research}} is to control the load of selected muscles by using a power-assisting device, thus enabling more effective motion support, rehabilitation and training by explicitly specifying the target muscles. In our past research, a control method was proposed for static human motion. The results of simulation and experiments showed {{that it is possible}} to control the force of selected muscle individually. However, the past method we proposed was only considered for constant posture, which led to a large effect of non-target muscle. In this paper, a new <b>pinpointed</b> muscle force <b>control</b> method is proposed to reduce the effect of non-target muscle taking into account human motion and external force. Human motion and external force was optimized individually in a double-loop searching algorithm, which reduced the computational cost.

40|$|Interest in {{femtosecond}} demagnetization dynamics was {{sparked by}} Bigot’s experiment in 1996, which unveiled the elementary mechanisms that relate the electrons’ temperature to their spin order. Simultaneously, {{the application of}} fast demagnetization experiments has been demonstrated to provide key insight into technologically important systems such as high-spin-polarization metals, and consequently there is broad interest in further understanding the physics of these phenomena. To gain new and relevant insights, we performed ultrafast optical pump-probe experiments to characterize the demagnetization processes of highly spin-polarized magnetic thin films on a femtosecond time scale. Full spin polarization is obtained in half-metallic ferro- or ferrimagnets, where only one spin channel is populated at the Fermi level, whereas the other one exhibits a gap. In these materials, the spin-scattering processes is controlled via the electronic structure, and thus their ultrafast demagnetization is solely related to the spin polarization via a Fermi golden-rule model. Accordingly, a long demagnetization time correlates with a high spin polarization due to {{the suppression of the}} spin-flip scattering at around the Fermi level. Here we show that isoelectronic Heusler compounds (Co_{ 2 }MnSi, Co_{ 2 }MnGe, and Co_{ 2 }FeAl) exhibit a degree of spin polarization between 59 % and 86 %. We explain this behavior by considering the robustness of the gap against structural disorder. Moreover, we observe that CoFe-based pseudogap materials, such as partially ordered Co-Fe-Ge and Co-Fe-B alloys, can reach similar values of the spin polarization. By using the unique features of these metals we vary the number of possible spin-flip channels, which allows us to <b>pinpoint</b> and <b>control</b> the half-metals’ electronic structure and its influence on the elementary mechanisms of ultrafast demagnetization...|$|R

40|$|Notwithstanding {{advances}} in modern chemical methods, the selective installation of sterically encumbered carbon stereocenters, in particular all-carbon quaternary centers, remains an unsolved problem in organic chemistry. The prevalence of all-carbon quaternary centers in biologically active natural products and pharmaceutical compounds provides a strong impetus to address current limitations {{in the state}} of the art of their generation. This thesis presents four related projects, all of which share in the goal of constructing highly-congested carbon centers in a stereoselective manner, and in the use of transition-metal catalyzed alkylation as a means to address that goal. The first research described is an extension of allylic alkylation methodology previously developed in the Stoltz group to small, strained rings. This research constitutes the first transition metal-catalyzed enantioselective α-alkylation of cyclobutanones. Under Pd-catalysis, this chemistry affords all–carbon α-quaternary cyclobutanones in good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities. Next is described our development of a (trimethylsilyl) ethyl β-ketoester class of enolate precursors, and their application in palladium–catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation to yield a variety of α-quaternary ketones and lactams. Independent coupling partner synthesis engenders enhanced allyl substrate scope relative to allyl β-ketoester substrates; highly functionalized α-quaternary ketones generated by the union of our fluoride-triggered β-ketoesters and sensitive allylic alkylation coupling partners serve to demonstrate the utility of this method for complex fragment coupling. Lastly, our development of an Ir-catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation of cyclic β-ketoesters to afford highly congested, vicinal stereocenters comprised of tertiary and all-carbon quaternary centers with outstanding regio-, diastereo-, and enantiocontrol is detailed. Implementation of a subsequent Pd-catalyzed alkylation affords dialkylated products with <b>pinpoint</b> stereochemical <b>control</b> of both chiral centers. The chemistry is then extended to include acyclic β-ketoesters and similar levels of selective and functional group tolerance are observed. Critical to the successful development of this method was the employment of iridium catalysis in concert with N-aryl-phosphoramidite ligands. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} study of the anisotropy of the magnetoelectric (ME) response in tri-layered composites based on single-crystalline piezoelectrics has been carried out. Quasi-static and resonant direct ME measurements were performed on Metglas/Piezoelectric/Metglas tri-layered structures featuring thin foils of the magnetostrictive Metglas alloy and differently oriented piezocrystals of LiNbO 3 (LNO) and GaPO 4 (GPO). The transversal ME effects {{were found to be}} strongly dependent on the direction of the applied in-plane magnetic bias fields as well as the orientation of the crystals. Multiple peaks of the ME response were observed corresponding to different contour resonance modes of the piezocrystals. The largest ME coefficient of up to 249 V/(cm. Oe) was observed for a composite with a 41 degrees Y-cut LNO crystal at 323. 1 kHz. In summary, we have shown that crystalline lead-free LNO and GPO can exhibit relatively large anisotropic ME effects in multilayers. The relations between the directional ME coupling and the material constants of the differently oriented piezocrystals were <b>pinpointed.</b> The precise <b>control</b> of this orientation should therefore allow one to engineer almost any desired quasi-static and resonant ME anisotropic properties for any specific application.
