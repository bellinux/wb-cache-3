50|$|MDF may be glued, doweled or laminated. Typical {{fasteners}} are T-nuts and <b>pan-head</b> machine screws. Smooth-shank nails do {{not hold}} well, and neither do fine-pitch screws, especially in the edge. Special screws are available with a coarse thread pitch, but sheet-metal screws also work well. Like natural wood, MDF may split when woodscrews are installed without pilot holes.|$|E
5000|$|Sheet metal screws (sometimes called [...] "sheet-metal self-tappers", or P-K screws {{from the}} brand name Parker Kalon - who pioneered the {{manufacture}} of, but did not invent, these screws) are a type of self-tapping screw despite the thread created in the sheet of metal being small. <b>Pan-head</b> PK Self-tapping screws are common in electrical equipment, while flatter-headed truss or flat countersunk headed self-tapping screws are more common in aviation applications.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a new continuum-based pantograph/catenary model {{based on}} the {{absolute}} nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) is proposed and used to develop an effective method to control the contact force which arises from the pantograph/catenary interaction. In the proposed new model, only one ANCF gradient vector {{is used in the}} formulation of the pantograph/catenary contact conditions, thereby allowing for using the proposed approach for both fully parameterized and gradient deficient ANCF finite elements. A three-dimensional multibody system (MBS) model of a pantograph mounted on a train is developed using a nonlinear augmented MBS formulation. In order {{to take into account the}} catenary large deformation, ANCF finite elements are used. The contact between the pantograph and the catenary system is ensured using a sliding joint constraint whereas the contact between the rail vehicle wheels and the train track is modelled using an elastic contact formulation. In addition to the use of the new MBS approach to model the pantograph/catenary interaction, the contact force between the pantograph and the catenary is computed using a simpler lumped parameter model which describes the <b>pan-head</b> and the plunger subsystem dynamics. In order to reduce the standard deviation of the contact force without affecting its mean value, a control actuator is used between the <b>pan-head</b> and the plunger. To this end, three types of control laws for the control action are designed to improve the contact quality both in the transient phase and in the steady state phase of the pantograph/catenary interaction. The first control law proposed features a feedback structure whereas the second and the third control strategies employ a feedback plus feed-forward architecture. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the results of a set of numerical simulations with and without the controllers are presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study rivets parameters which were affecting to strength of joint of aluminium. Full factorial experimental design was conducted as 3 factors and 3 levels. The parameters were consisted of three levels of drilled holes, buck-tail length and upset distance. Furthermore, the experiment was done by <b>pan-head</b> rivet. The lap joint was selected to experiments on the specimens that were consisting of three thicknesses of 1, 2 and 3 mm. The main factors and interaction between factors that affected to strength of joint was analyzed. Effect of drilled holes size, buck-tail length and upset distance on strength of joint was discussed. The effect of thickness on strength of joint was reported. In order to finding suitable of upset distance, the tension load was analyzed and compared...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Construction {{of kitchen}} cabinet in Malaysia {{has grown in}} {{correspond}} to {{the increasing number of}} housing development. However, kitchen cabinet supplier is facing with major problem regarding to the increasing number of failure that occurred at the screw jointing during kitchen cabinet installation. Thus, the objective of the study is to observed the failure or damages during screw fixing on kitchen cabinet. It was observed that the screw head and driving features effect the number of damages and the failure mode type. Screw with <b>pan-head</b> type has the lowest number of damages compared with countersunk head screw. Selecting screw insertion technique is also important in order to reduce number of damages. Insertion technique with pilot-hole pre-drilling managed to reduce number of damages and type of failure modes occurred. With this paper, the kitchen cabinet manufacturer will be able to select the best screw with their preferable insertion technique {{in order to reduce the}} number of damages used for kitchen cabinet jointing...|$|E
