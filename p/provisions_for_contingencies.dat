40|$|This article studies {{rules of}} "damage measures" that {{determine}} how much money must be paid by a party who defaults on a contract to the other party to the contract. The theme of the article is that damage measures serve {{as a substitute for}} completely specified contracts. In particular, it is shown that under an incompletely specified contract damage measures can induce parties to behave in a way that approximates what they would have explicitly agreed upon under a fully specified contract. Moreover, it is argued on familiar lines that because it is often costly or impossible to make contractual <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> <b>contingencies</b> at a very detailed level, there is an evident need for such substitutes for well-specified contingent contracts as are afforded by damage measures...|$|E
25|$|In 2006, ACP {{estimated}} {{the cost of}} the third set of locks project at US$5.25 billion. This figure includes design, administrative, construction, testing, environmental mitigation, and commissioning costs, as well as contingencies to cover risks and unforeseen events, such as accidents, design changes, price increases, and possible delays. The cost of interest paid on loans during construction is not included. The largest cost is that associated with constructing the two new lock complexes—one each on the Atlantic and Pacific sides—with estimated costs of US$1.11 billion and US$1.03 billion each, plus a US$590 million <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> possible <b>contingencies</b> during their construction.|$|R

[...] Doug says [...].work measurement for {{arriving at a}} standard time should normally make <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> relaxation, <b>contingency</b> and special allowances. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), as of 1992 there were some 200 different PTS systems.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to verify the perception of accountants, auditors and consultants in relation to Brazilian accounting standards for pension funds. For this a questionnaire was prepared and sent to accountants, auditors and accounting of pension fund consultants. 132 were returned, of which 110 worked as an accountant in any entity, 8 rendering services as external auditors and 14 as consultants. The results obtained indicate that, in general, these professionals know the accounting standards for pension funds used in Brazil and believe that such standards are adequate, except for the period of addressing the deficit, <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> doubtful accounts, <b>contingency</b> reserve boundary and evaluation of real estate investments, in which the perception of the professionals is that the procedures in the international standard are more suitable...|$|R
5000|$|Published by University of Manchester, the Working Papers of [...] "Capturing the Gains, global summit" [...] brings {{together}} an international network of experts from North and South. The Working Paper 14 {{focuses on a}} specific feature of buying behaviour in the UK fashion retail industry: the negotiation of a manufacturing price (cut-make-trim, CMT, cost) with suppliers that does not separately itemize labour cost. This practice, tacitly supported by both buyers and suppliers, is examined {{against the backdrop of}} ongoing wage defaulting and import price deflation in the global apparel industry. For obvious reasons, the make-up of standard time using Predetermined Time standards (PTS), Predetermined motion time system (PMTS); is highly technical and ‘synthetic’. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), as of 1992 there were some 200 different PTS systems, offered by consultancies for adoption by manufacturing companies. In apparel manufacture, three PTS (aka PMTS) consultancy firms specializing in methods-time measurement (MTM) appear to be operating in the sector- the US-based Modular Arrangement of Predetermined Time Standards (MODAPTS), the Sri Lankan-based Seweasy and the UK-headquartered GSD (Corporate) Ltd. All three forms of work measurement for arriving at a standard time should normally make <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> relaxation, <b>contingency</b> and special allowances.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{practical}} considerations that will confront the bailiff in every community where he meets this question. If {{the county has}} made no <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> such a <b>contingency,</b> I think he can do so within the law by providing such dining and lodging facilities as will enable him to keep supervision over the jury and prevent outside communication with it. I {{do not think the}} Negro juror should be required to eat in anything that savors of a [...] "cubbyhole", neither should he be placed in an environment that in any manner tends to humiliate or otherwise subtract from the place of importance his station as a juror clothes him with. Serving on a jury is a civil responsibility that the law imposes on white and colored alike so we are concerned here only with the law regulating such service. The law of segregation as defined in this State is in no way involved. Segregation in Florida is in the main concerned with separate schools for whites and coloreds and the prohibition of intermarriage between members of the two races. **6 Social taboos are in another category, but neither has any more place in this case than Newton's law of gravitation.|$|R
