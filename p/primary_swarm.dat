40|$|Honeybee colonies {{reproduce}} by colony fission and swarming. The <b>primary</b> <b>swarm</b> {{leaves the}} nest with the mated mother queen. Further "after-swarms" {{can leave the}} nest. These are composed of virgin queens and sister workers. Since all workers in the <b>primary</b> <b>swarm</b> have the same relationship to the mother queen, kin recognition cannot have any e#ect on the worker distribution in the swarm. Because of polyandry of the mother queen, the after-swarm is composed of superand halfsister workers of the virgin queen. In this case kin recognition might a#ect swarm composition if workers increase their inclusive fitness by preferentially investing in a supersister queen. The distribution of workers in the mother colony, the primary and the afterswarm was analyzed using single-locus DNA fingerprinting in two colonies of the honeybee (Apis mellifera). The colonies were composed of 21 and 24 worker subfamilies because of multiple mating of the queen. The subfamily distribution in the mother colonies before swarming was significantly di#erent from the subfamily frequencies in the <b>primary</b> <b>swarm.</b> This indicates di#erent propensities for swarming in the various subfamilies. The subfamily distribution was also significantly di#erent between the mother colony and the after-swarm. There was however no significant di#erence between the subfamily composition of the primary and the afterswarm. The average e#ects of kin recognition {{on the distribution of}} the subfamilies in the two after-swarms were less than 2 %. We conclude that colony-level selection sets the evolutionary framework for swarming behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Cartilage tumours present ongoing {{therapeutic}} challenges due {{to their}} chondrogenic extracellular matrix that potentially hampers drug delivery, their low percentage of dividing cells, and their poor vascularity. In this context, {{and based on the}} affinity of the quaternary ammonium moiety for proteoglycans (PG), we developed a strategy that uses the quaternary ammonium function to selectively deliver DNA alkylating agents to the cartilage tumour tissue. We engineered the quaternary ammonium derivative of melphalan (Mel-AQ) and assessed its antitumoural activity in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, micromolar concentrations of Mel-AQ inhibited the proliferation of human HEMC-SS chondrosarcoma and Saos- 2 osteosarcoma cell lines. Moreover, 24 -h incubation with 20 μM Mel-AQ induced a 2. 5 -fold increase in S population and a 1. 5 -fold increase in subG 0 G 1 population compared to controls. In vivo, Mel-AQ demonstrated antitumour activity in the orthotopic model of <b>primary</b> <b>Swarm</b> rat chondrosarcoma. When given to chondrosarcoma-bearing rats (three doses of 16 μmol/kg at days 8, 12 and 16 post-implant), Mel-AQ demonstrated an optimal antitumour effect at day 43, when tumour cell growth inhibition peaked at 69 %. Interestingly, the treatment protocol was proved well tolerated, since the animals showed no weight loss {{over the course of the}} study. This antitumoural effect was assessed in vivo by scintigraphic imaging using 99 mTc-NTP 15 – 5 developed in our lab as a PG-targeting radiotracer, and tumour tissue was analyzed at study-end by biochemical PG assay with Alcian blue staining. Mel-AQ treatment led to a significant decrease in the PG content of tumoural tissue. These experimental results highlighted the promising antitumour potential of Mel-AQ as a PG-targeting strategy for therapeutic management of chondrosarcoma...|$|E
40|$|Rules {{determine}} how a system operates {{within the boundaries}} of its given environment. This principle is present within both natural and man-made systems alike. The term "man-made system" refers to systems which have been developed, implementing a specifically designed rule-set for its functionality. Whereas "natural systems" are those rules presented and seen within various species or environments within the natural world. The research presented within this thesis looks at the methods and results of discovering rules from swarm systems. The swarm is a phenomenon seen within the natural world where same species individuals group together to accomplish a task using their behaviours. This has many aspects of difficulty to it, various species employ differing rules, and a species can employ individuals with differing rule-sets. The <b>primary</b> <b>swarm</b> to be investigated is the Bird flock, with a developed simulation being used as a test-bed. The BOlD simulation presents a computer program incorporating a visual representation of the birds, each employing 3 basic rules. The challenge for this work is to develop a method of providing a generic rule discovery system for swarms. This encompasses the ability to collect and manipulate data, and discover the rules present within differing species and roles within swarms. An additional objective is to present a novel method for verifying or validating the rules, employing performance testing. This type of testing provides much insight into the validity of the rules by determining how well they perform when tested against the original rule-set. The data collected from the BOlD simulation was transformed into the selected attributes for mining, with a rule algorithm being used to discover rules. The rules which were discovered provided an insight into the behaviours of the swarm, with the performance testing proving that they were not as effective or efficient as the original rules employed within the simulation. The presented research provides the ability to gather a further insight into swarm behaviours, and presents a varying method for understanding the interactions we view every day within these swarms.

40|$|Abstract: Gears are {{industrial}} components with {{a precise}} geometry. Identification of their basic parameters {{plays an important}} role in their reverse design and quality control process. This article describes a new approach for the calculation of helical gear’s basic parameters using optical data acquired by 3 D digitizer. This approach is implemented by acquiring cloud-of-points data (COP-data) from the bearing seats and gear tooth surface. Cylinder surface fitting through COP-data acquired from bearing seats is performed for the determination of gear axis of rotation. In a final step, involute helicoid surface fitting through COP-data acquired from gear tooth surface determines the helical gear’s <b>primary</b> features. Particle <b>swarm</b> optimization algo-rithm as an efficient method is applied to perform the surface fitting process in this article...|$|R
40|$|Macrophagetropic R 5 human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) isolates often evolve into dualtropic R 5 X 4 variants during disease progression. The structural basis for CCR 5 coreceptor function has been studied in {{a limited number of}} prototype strains and suggests that R 5 and R 5 X 4 Envs interact differently with CCR 5. However, differences between unrelated viruses may reflect strain-specific factors and do not necessarily represent changes resulting from R 5 to R 5 X 4 evolution of a virus in vivo. Here we addressed CCR 5 domains involved in fusion for a large set of closely related yet functionally distinct variants within a <b>primary</b> isolate <b>swarm,</b> employing R 5 and R 5 X 4 Envs derived from the HIV- 1 89. 6 PI quasispecies. R 5 variants of 89. 6 PI could fuse using either N-terminal or extracellular loop CCR 5 sequences in the context of CCR 5 /CXCR 2 chimeras, similar to the unrelated R 5 strain JRFL, but R 5 X 4 variants of 89. 6 PI were highly dependent on the CCR 5 N terminus. Similarly, R 5 89. 6 PI variants and isolate JRFL tolerated N-terminal CCR 5 deletions, but fusion by most R 5 X 4 variants was markedly impaired. R 5 89. 6 PI Envs also tolerated multiple extracellular domain substitutions, while R 5 X 4 variants did not. In contrast to CCR 5 use, fusion by R 5 X 4 variants of 89. 6 PI was largely independent of the CXCR 4 N-terminal region. Thus, R 5 and R 5 X 4 species from a single swarm differ in how they interact with CCR 5. These results suggest that R 5 Envs possess a highly plastic capacity to interact with multiple CCR 5 regions and support the concept that viral evolution in vivo results from the emergence of R 5 X 4 variants with the capacity to use the CXCR 4 extracellular loops but demonstrate less-flexible interactions with CCR 5 that are strongly dependent on the N-terminal region...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of autonomous swarming {{command and control}} networks will introduce new layers of human decision making complexity never before experienced in command and control environments. One of the <b>primary</b> advantages of <b>swarming</b> networks of autonomous vehicles {{is the ability of}} these networks to process large amounts of information in relatively short periods of time to more optimally achieve a mission goal, all while protecting humans from high risk and potentially hostile environments. However, even though the human may be taken out of the physical control loop in these systems, it will still be critical to include the human at some level of decision making within these swarming networks both as a safety check and also to ensure that the automation is truly supporting overall mission goals. Because of the revolutionary nature of swarming technology, futuristic human interaction with complex autonomous vehicle networks is not well understood, and more research emphasis needs to be placed on human requirements, strengths, and limitations for supervisory control of swarming networks of multiple autonomous vehicles. This research should include an investigation of the interaction of increasing vehicle autonomy on human supervisory control, the effect of increased levels of automation in decision-making, and how situation awareness is impacted by these increasing levels of vehicle autonomy and decision making automation...|$|R
