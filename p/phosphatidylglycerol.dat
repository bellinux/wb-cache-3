5|$|Other headgroups {{are also}} present {{to varying degrees}} and can include {{phosphatidylserine}} (PS) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and <b>phosphatidylglycerol</b> (PG). These alternate headgroups often confer specific biological functionality that is highly context-dependent. For instance, PS presence on the extracellular membrane face of erythrocytes is a marker of cell apoptosis, whereas PS in growth plate vesicles {{is necessary for the}} nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals and subsequent bone mineralization. Unlike PC, some of the other headgroups carry a net charge, which can alter the electrostatic interactions of small molecules with the bilayer.|$|E
25|$|The cell {{membranes}} of bacteria {{are rich in}} acidic phospholipids, such as <b>phosphatidylglycerol</b> and cardiolipin. These phospholipid headgroups are heavily negatively charged. Therefore, the outmost leaflets of the bilayer which is exposed {{to the outside of}} the bacterial membranes are more attractive to the attack of the positively charged antimicrobial peptides. So the interaction between the positive charges of antimicrobial peptides and the negatively charged bacterial membranes is mainly the electrostatic interactions, which is the major driving force for cellular association. In addition, since antimicrobial peptides form structures with a positively charged face as well as a hydrophobic face, there are also some hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic regions of the antimicrobial peptides and the zwitterionic phospholipids (electrically neutral) surface of the bacterial membranes, which act only as a minor effect in this case.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{mechanisms}} {{behind this}} complex {{sequence of events}} are still a matter of debate. To simplify the system and allow more definitive study, many experiments have been performed in vitro with synthetic lipid vesicles. These {{studies have shown that}} divalent cations {{play a critical role in}} the fusion process by binding to negatively charged lipids such as phosphatidylserine, <b>phosphatidylglycerol</b> and cardiolipin. One role on these ions in the fusion process is to shield the negative charge on the surface of the bilayer, diminishing electrostatic repulsion and allowing the membranes to approach each other. This is clearly not the only role, however, since there is an extensively documented difference in the ability of Mg2+ versus Ca2+ to induce fusion. Although Mg2+ will induce extensive aggregation it will not induce fusion, while Ca2+ induces both. It has been proposed that this discrepancy is due to a difference in extent of dehydration. Under this theory, calcium ions bind more strongly to charged lipids, but less strongly to water. The resulting displacement of calcium for water destabilizes the lipid-water interface and promotes intimate interbilayer contact. A recently proposed alternative hypothesis is that the binding of calcium induces a destabilizing lateral tension. Whatever the mechanism of calcium-induced fusion, the initial interaction is clearly electrostatic, since zwitterionic lipids are not susceptible to this effect.|$|E

40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{of different}} types of <b>phosphatidylglycerols</b> onto magnetizable solid particles is studied. The super-paramagnetic magnetite spheres used have an average diameter of only 14 nm and are stabilized by lauric acid to keep them in solution. During incubation and dialysis of this water-based magnetic fluid in the presence of preformed sonicated phospholipid vesicles, magnetoliposomes are formed which are captured from solution with high efficiency by high-gradient magnetophoresis. Support for the bilayer character of the phospholipid coat is derived from both theoretical calculations and experimental data. Phospholipids which form the inner monolayer are adsorbed very quickly with their charged head-group orientated towards the iron oxide surface. The high-affinity character of the binding is reflected in the adsorption isotherms and is further illustrated by their non-extractability with high concentrations of Tween 20. The outer layer assembles through interaction with the exposed hydrocarbon chains. As compared to the inner layer, the phospholipids adsorb at a much slower rate and are displaced by Tween 20 concentrations which usually disrupt conventional membranes.

We applied two different mammalian mitochondrial CLs and one species extracted from the membrane of Escherichia coli.

40|$|Surface tensions, {{critical}} micelle concentrations (CMCs), {{contact angles}} on hydrophobic polyethylene, and foaming characteristics of phosphatidic acids, phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and <b>phosphatidylglycerols</b> were measured {{to determine their}} suitability as substitutes for traditional surfactants. These phospholipids have fatty acid chains of 5 to 12 carbon atoms, a range over which they are soluble at room temperature. Their surface tensions decrease with increasing concentrations until their CMCs are reached, above which their plateau surface tensions are as low as 21 mN/m, indicating excellent surface activities. In general, plateau surface tensions decrease with increasing chain length within each phospholipid type. The classical relationship for In CMC vs. chain length is followed with slopes typical of anionic surfactants for phosphatidic acids and <b>phosphatidylglycerols</b> and resembling zwitterionic surfactants for phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines, consistent with the charge on the hydrophilic group. The wetting capabilities of aqueous solutions on polyethylene are good and foam heights and stabilities are high, the latter two properties being comparable to traditional anionic (sodium dodecylsulfate) and nonionic (octylphenol polyethoxylate) surfactants.

Lipid areas are found to be larger than their phosphatidylcholine (PC) counterparts, a result likely due to repulsive electrostatic interactions taking place between the charged PG headgroups even in the presence of sodium counterions. In general, PG and PC bilayers show a similar response to changes in temperature and chain length, but differ in their response to chain unsaturation. For example, compared to PC bilayers, the inclusion of a first double bond in PG lipids results in a smaller incremental change to the area per lipid and bilayer thickness.
