40|$|Evolution of {{informatics}} ontologies {{is related}} to the evolution of semantic web. There is a large scale of ontologies designed to describe various application areas today. To cover the largest possible part of them, ontologies that use similar terminology and that have been designed for the particular domain are mapped and integrated. While the matching process allows to discover relationships and similarities between individual parts of ontologies, the integration process merges existing ontologies to create new ones. The aim of the thesis is to introduce basic principles of semantic web and knowledge ontologies. Practical part of the study is focused on ontology merging. The output of the thesis is created by the results of experimental measurement. Two independent ontology merging systems have been used for the experiment: DKP-OM and PROMPT. Integration results have then been compared and evaluated with general metrics. The bachelor thesis is divided into several sections. First part describes the theory behind semantic web and knowledge ontologies. Second chapter defines the matching <b>process</b> <b>and</b> <b>ontology</b> integration and introduces the tools used for the experiment. Third chapter covers evaluation metrics of ontology integration. The last part focuses on the experiment itself and its evaluation...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a comparative methodology and research practice enabling the interpretive social study of urban built environments (cross-culturally and diachronically). Its contribution to comparative urbanism is framed specifically {{as a method}} for studying the socio-spatial significance of the material presence of the composition of urban form (conceptualised as boundaries) to the interactional process of human inhabitation. This perspective results from formulating a theoretical and conceptual rejoinder to questioning {{the nature of the}} role of the built environment as emergent from the human process of inhabiting the world and the functioning of urban life and development. On that basis an empirically operational method (Boundary Line Type (BLT) mapping) for the conceptual remapping and analysis of ground level spatial data on the urban built environment (city plans) is devised, so the comparative socio-spatial study of cities from this perspective through time and across geographical areas and societies or cultures becomes enabled. This foundational development of a research <b>process</b> <b>and</b> <b>ontology</b> is informed by a material adaptation of a critical realist philosophy of science. The practical and technical implications of executing the mapping process on spatial data of varying nature (archaeological, historical, historically reconstructive, and contemporary maps) are comprehensively worked through. The comparative functional ability of the method is demonstrated by exemplifying two case studies, the cities of Chunchucmil (Mexico, Classic Maya) and Winchester (UK, 16 th, 19 th and 21 st century), on the basis of which two test cases are taken forward for preliminary visualisation and analysis with the aid of Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques. The findings confirm its potential, replicating common expectations about contemporary urban life as well as laying a novel foundation for insights into Winchester’s historical development and Chunchucmil’s archaeology, from which future research and development can burgeon. These are expected to contribute significantly to the deeper understanding of urban life and urbanisation across past and present urban traditions and provide an improved appreciation of urban alternatives which could inform planning and urban design in the long term...|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{one of the}} {{key issues}} facing {{applications}} and integration of Geographic Information Systems is the lack of interoperability among various systems due to the diversity of data representations. The semantics of geographic information have been identified to provide a conceptual model in which common understanding of the information can be achieved to support interoperability. Ontologies with capability of conceptualise information domains can be used as the tool for expressing the semantics. This paper describes how to utilise ontologies to capture the semantics of geographic information and further presents a way to represent and store spatial data in a knowledge base within an ontology. By representing geographic information in an ontology, the reasoning capability supplied by the knowledge representation can be explored to provide new methods for utilising and analysing spatial information. Interoperability is a key concern in the field of Geographic Information Sciences for the sharing of geographic information and the integration of geospatial processes. Web service technology is a mainstream approach to distribute GIS functionality in the Web environment and provide syntactic interoperability for different <b>processes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>ontologies</b> have been considered as a significant technique to achieve interoperability on the semantic level.

In {{order to find}} a desired template, the semantics of various process templates should be machine-readable and interoperable.

Here we adopt one of the emerging semantic web techniques – the semantic annotation of process templates in order to enhance the interoperability for better reuse of process templates. Our semantic annotation consists of three basic parts: model profile, model content and meta model annotation.

My other research problem is how to organize the extracted knowledge, what are the appropriate ICT solutions, environment for it. I reviewed theoretical foundations of related fields, like business process management, semantic technology, semantic business <b>process</b> management <b>and</b> <b>ontologies.</b> Ontologies {{play a key role in}} semantic business process management, because they provide the structure for organizational knowledge. Therefore I discussed their background detailed in the literature review section. I have identified the requirements in the business process modeling level to be able to use a complex process model as a base of creating the links between the <b>process</b> models <b>and</b> the domain <b>ontology.</b> The novelty of the solution is based on the connection between <b>process</b> model <b>and</b> corporate knowledge, where the process structure will be extended with the annotation for knowledge structure.

Ted Honderich (2000) The problem of consciousness is traditionally {{understood as the}} difficult task of justifying the emergence of an inner world of experiences, qualia and/or mental representations from a substrate of physical things conceived as autonomously existing. I argue that an alternative approach is possible, but it requires a conceptual reconstruction of consciousness and existence as two different perspectives on the same underlying process. On this basis, I present a view of direct (conscious) perception that supposes a unity of the activity in the brain and the events in the external world. The underlying process is referred to as onphene.

40|$|SWAE aims at {{evaluating}} how and {{how much}} the Semantic Web vision has met its promises with respect to business and market needs. Even though the Semantic Web {{is a relatively new}} branch of scientific and technological research, its relevance has already been envisaged for some crucial business processes: Semantic-based business data integration: data integration satisfies both "structural" requirements of enterprises (e. g. the possibility of consulting its data in a unified manner), and "dynamic" requirement (e. g. business-to-business partnerships to execute an order). Information systems implementing semantic web architectures can strongly support this process, or simply enable it. Semantic interoperability: metadata <b>and</b> <b>ontologies</b> support the dynamic and flexible exchange of data and services across information systems of different organizations. The development of applications for the automatic classification of services and goods on the basis of standard hierarchies, and the translation of such classifications into the different standards used by companies is a clear example of the potential for semantic interoperability methods and tools. Knowledge management: <b>ontologies</b> <b>and</b> automated reasoning tools seem to provide an innovative support to the elicitation, representation and sharing of corporate knowledge. In particular, for the shift from document-centric KM to an entity-centric KM approach. Enterprise <b>and</b> <b>process</b> modeling: <b>ontologies</b> <b>and</b> rules are becoming an effective way for modeling corporate <b>processes</b> <b>and</b> business domains (for example, in cost reduction).
