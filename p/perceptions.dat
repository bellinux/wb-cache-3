Yet, rather than directly addressing affordance <b>perception,</b> most of the empirical work evaluating Proffitt's approach focuses on the <b>perception</b> of spatial properties of the environment. We propose that theoretical and empirical efforts should be directed toward an understanding of the relationship between affordance <b>perception</b> and spatial <b>perception,</b> keeping in mind that this relationship is nontrivial because affordance <b>perception</b> is dichotomous, whereas the <b>perception</b> of spatial properties is gradual. We argue that the <b>perception</b> of spatial properties of the environment is enslaved by affordance <b>perception,</b> most notably at the critical boundaries for action. To empirically scrutinize this proposition, and to solve issues raised regarding the validity of several empirical findings, we call for joint research efforts to further understanding of embodied <b>perception...</b>|$|R

40|$|Disorders {{of music}} and speech <b>perception,</b> known as amusia and aphasia, have {{traditionally}} been regarded as dissociated deficits based on studies of brain damaged patients. This has been taken as evidence that music and speech are perceived by largely separate and independent networks in the brain. However, recent studies of congenital amusia have broadened this view by showing that the deficit is associated with problems in perceiving speech prosody, especially intonation and emotional prosody. In the present study the association between the <b>perception</b> {{of music and}} speech prosody was investigated with healthy Finnish adults (n = 61) using an on-line music <b>perception</b> test including the Scale subtest of Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA) and Off-Beat and Out-of-key tasks {{as well as a}} prosodic verbal task that measures the <b>perception</b> of word stress. Regression analyses showed that there was a clear association between prosody <b>perception</b> and music <b>perception,</b> especially in the domain of rhythm <b>perception.</b> This association was evident after controlling for music education, age, pitch <b>perception,</b> visuospatial <b>perception</b> and working memory. Pitch <b>perception</b> was significantly associated with music <b>perception</b> but not with prosody <b>perception.</b> The association between music <b>perception</b> and visuospatial <b>perception</b> (measured using analogous tasks) was less clear. Overall, the pattern of results indicates that there is a robust link between music and speech <b>perception</b> and that this link can be mediated by rhythmic cues (time and stress) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — While many {{specific}} <b>perception</b> tasks {{have been}} addressed {{in the context of}} robot manipulation, {{the problem of how to}} design and realize comprehensive and integrated robot <b>perception</b> systems for manipulation tasks has received little attention so far. In this paper, we describe and discuss the design and realization of COP-MAN, a <b>perception</b> system that is tailored for personal robots performing pick-and-place tasks, such as setting the table, loading the dishwasher, and cleaning up, in human living environments. We describe our approach to decomposing and structuring the <b>perception</b> tasks into subtasks in order to make the overall <b>perception</b> system effective, reliable, and fast. Distinctive characteristics and features of COP-MAN include semantic <b>perception</b> capabilities, passive <b>perception</b> and a knowledge processing interface to <b>perception.</b> The semantic <b>perception</b> capabilities enable the robot to perceive the environment in terms of objects of given categories, to infer functional and affordance based information about objects and the geometric and part-based reconstruction of objects for grasping. Passive <b>perception</b> allows for real-time coarse-grained <b>perception</b> of the dynamic aspects, and the knowledge processing interface to <b>perception</b> enables the robot to query the information it needs, which is then automatically acquired through active <b>perception</b> routines.

A randomized controlled trial was con- ducted in Évora, Portugal, in 2008, in which 62 healthy adult women were randomized to a Pilates-based mat (experimental group) (n D 38, mean age ̇ SD, 41. 08 ̇ 6. 64 years) or a control group (n D 24, mean age ̇ SD, 40. 25 ̇ 7. 70 years). Experimen- tal group participants performed the Initial Mat of Body Control Pilates twice per week, 60 -minutes per session. Repeated measure- ments were performed at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. No significant differences between the two groups were observed in life satisfaction, <b>perception</b> of appreciation by other people, <b>perception</b> of physical appearance, <b>perception</b> of functionality, total physical self-concept, and <b>perception</b> of health status at three time point measures (baseline, after 3 months, and after 6 months).
