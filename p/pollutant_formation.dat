30|$|In conclusion, in Fig.  10 the {{calculated}} CFD <b>pollutant</b> <b>formation</b> {{along with the}} net heat release is shown. The details provided by the CFD analysis support the previous hypothesis that the chemical dissociation and re-association phenomena influence the gross heat release evidenced in Fig.  9. Indeed, as expected, during the expansion phase, the chemical re-association releases {{a small amount of}} heat which has been absorbed during the initial combustion phase. This explains the differences highlighted in Figs.  7, 8, and 9. During the first stage of the combustion, the <b>pollutant</b> <b>formation</b> absorbs heat which is gradually restored in the expansion phase. Since the SZ model {{does not take into account}} the dynamics of the chemical reactions, in the first combustion phase the SZ model overestimates the heat release while in the expansion phase the error is balanced by the heat restored due to the chemical re-association. In Fig.  11, the NO 2 formation is compared with the in-cylinder temperature trend, calculated through the ANSYS Forte simulation. Also, in this case, a strong relation between temperature and <b>pollutant</b> <b>formation</b> is clearly evident.|$|E

40|$|Lean {{premixed}} combustion {{provides a}} means to reduce <b>pollutant</b> <b>formation</b> and increase combustion efficiency. However, fuel-air mixing is rarely uniform in space and time. This nonuniformity in concentration will lead to relative increases in <b>pollutant</b> <b>formation</b> and decreases in combustion efficiency. The nonuniformity of the concentration at the exit of the premixer has been defined by Lyons (1981) as the ``unmixedness. `` Although turbulence properties such as length scales and strain rate are known to effect unmixedness, the exact relationship is unknown. Evaluating this relationship {{and the effect of}} unmixedness in premixed combustion on <b>pollutant</b> <b>formation</b> and combustion efficiency {{are an important part of}} the overall goal of US Department of Energy`s Advanced Turbine System (ATS) program and are among the goals of the program described herein.

As observed, injector flow rate affects the combustion and <b>pollutants</b> <b>formation</b> mechanism through its effect on the fuel-air mixing rate. Higher injection rates are more beneficial to the improvement of bsfc-NO and soot-NO trade-offs at low engine speed whereas the opposite occurs at high engine speed.

For this purpose a commercial burner (DCC MAB) was studied. We aim to optimize its geometry following the guidelines of flameless combustion where recirculation of exhaust flue gases dilutes the entering air, hence the concentration of oxygen within the reaction zone is much lower compared to ordinary flame combustion.
