40|$|At present, the {{question}} of the move from 193 to 157 nm lithography is under discussion. There are still several major issues such as the development of 157 nm photo-resists and pellicles, as well as calcium-fluoride lens material availability. The extension of the 193 nm lithography down to the 65 - and 45 -nm half pitch technologies is now considered as a serious alternative. This requires several technical challenges with the use of phase shift masks (PSM), optical proximity effects corrections or liquid immersion. Simulation gives information on expected <b>process</b> <b>latitudes</b> and is an important tool to help this technical choice. Previous works [1, 2] have shown that the "Diffused Aerial Image Model" (DAIM) [3] is accurate for CD prediction. Reliable <b>process</b> <b>latitudes</b> can be extracted from the simulated focus-exposure matrices (FEM). The model is used for the <b>process</b> <b>latitudes</b> evaluation of the different lithography approaches possibly used to print the 65 - and 45 -nm half pitches. 193 nm illumination in addition to PSM is compared to 157 nm lithography associated with conventional or optimized illumination schemes. This work shows that PSM at 193 nm gives generally better exposure latitude for all pitches and CD, and confirms that 193 nm lithography is a possible alternative to achieve 45 nm and 70 nm half pitches patterning. The process windows are nevertheless very small, and huge mask error factors (MEEF) are another sign that printing such small features is close to the physical limit (k 1 factor close to the quarter) ...|$|R

Many peatlands, {{such as those in}} the British Isles, Sweden and Canada, have undergone increased erosion, resulting in degraded water quality and depleted soil carbon stocks. It is unclear how climate change may impact future peat erosion. Here we use a physically-based erosion model (PESERA-PEAT), driven by seven different global climate models (GCMs), to predict fluvial blanket peat erosion in the Northern Hemisphere under 21 st-century climate change. After an initial decline, total hemispheric blanket peat erosion rates are found to increase during 2070 - 2099 (2080 s) compared with the baseline period (1961 - 1990) for most of the GCMs. Regional erosion variability is high with changes to baseline ranging between - 1. 27 and + 21. 63 [*]t[*]ha- 1 yr- 1 in the 2080 s.

40|$|The use of subresolution assist {{features}} (SRAFs) in {{the photo}} mask is one of resolution enhancement techniques in photolithography, which can minimize linewidth variation caused by proximity effect. However, the <b>process</b> <b>latitude</b> with SRAFs through various pitches is not uniform. From {{the point of view}} of lithography, pitches with low <b>process</b> <b>latitude,</b> called forbidden areas, should be avoided. These forbidden areas exist often in the layout after routing since they are larger than the minimum clearance required in the design rules. In this paper, a pitch optimization method applied in the post-routing phase is proposed to avoid the forbidden areas. Experimental data of lithography techniques and geometric constraints from the layout are formulated into a constrained quadratic optimization problem. By using the spacing technique, wire segments in the affected area are adjusted to their new locations obtained from solving the optimization problem by quadratic programming.

First, a modified Large Scale GeostrophicModel (LSG) with global data assimilation and an integration time scaleof 13 years is constrained further by hydrographic sections in the Ross andWeddell seas.

The models have considerable success at predicting the synoptic–scale depressions that occur over the ocean and in the coastal region.

This thesis characterizes the {{minimum resolvable feature}} size and <b>process</b> <b>latitude</b> of Conformable Contact Lithography. Beginning with a review of current lithographic patterning techniques, choice of Conformable Contract Lithography as an exposure technique is discussed. A design for a trilayer stack that optimizes optical properties is established using experimental and simulated reflectance data to choose appropriate stack film thicknesses. The simulated <b>process</b> <b>latitude</b> is constructed using electromagnetic simulations of grating patterns. Image analysis of experimentally-exposed diffraction grating patterns is described and used to characterize the effect of exposure dose on printed linewidth. The resulting simulated and experimental process latitudes for printed gratings are presented for masks utilizing protruding chrome lines and embedded chrome lines. Experimental and simulated reflectance for single-layer and bilayer film stacks are compared to yield an optimized trilayer stack design of 225 nm of anti-reflection-coating chemically separated from the resist by 70 nm of evaporated silicon oxide. This design results in less than 1. 5 % back-reflection from the oxide into the resist for 10 % film thickness variation. Finite-difference time-domain simulations are optimized by comparing higher variable-resolution, more realistic simulations to more efficient, lower variable-resolution simulations. Building on the trilayer stack and optimal simulation specification, simulated exposures of diffraction gratings are analyzed assuming a clipping model of development. Exposures of dense grating patterns with two geometries are performed on trilayer-stack-coated silicon wafers {{for a range of}} doses. (cont.) Transferred grating patterns are analyzed to establish the effect of exposure dose on printed linewidth.

About two-thirds of this precipitation is sublimated during the winter but what remains still produces a snow pack that is very large compared to that observed with correspondingly excessive spring runoff. A large cold anomaly over the Sahara desert and Sahel also appears to be a consequence of a large anomaly in downward longwave radiation, although in this case it is not anomalous clouds but low column water vapor that appears to be most responsible.
