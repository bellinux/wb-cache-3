No chemical toxicity has yet been observed in the tracheobronchial tract and the lungs from exposure to thorium. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> thorium compounds are at a risk of dermatitis.

25|$|Anthrax {{is spread}} by {{contact with the}} spores of the bacteria, which are often from {{infectious}} animal products. Contact is by breathing, eating, or through an area of broken skin. It does not typically spread directly between people. Risk factors include <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> animals or animal products, travelers, postal workers, and military personnel. Diagnosis can be confirmed based on finding antibodies or the toxin in the blood or by culture of a sample from the infected site.|$|E
25|$|Huntley had {{not been}} convicted {{of any of the}} {{criminal}} allegations, but his burglary charge had remained on file. Howard Gilbert, then headteacher of Soham Village College, later said that he would not have employed Huntley as a caretaker if he had been aware of the burglary charge, as one of Huntley's key responsibilities in his role was to ensure security in the school grounds – a role unfit for a suspected burglar. The Soham murders led to tightening of procedures in the Criminal Records Bureau system which checks the criminal background of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> children, following criticism that the system had weaknesses and loopholes.|$|E

25|$|Animal {{control and}} {{vaccination}} programs have decreased {{the risk of}} rabies from dogs {{in a number of}} regions of the world. Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those who are at high risk. The high-risk group includes <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> bats or who spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where rabies is common. In people who have been exposed to rabies, the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms. Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water, povidone iodine, or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission. Only six people have survived a rabies infection after showing symptoms, and this was with extensive treatment known as the Milwaukee protocol.|$|E
25|$|<b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> {{poultry and}} swine, {{especially}} those with intense exposures, {{are at increased risk}} of zoonotic infection with influenza virus endemic in these animals, and constitute a population of human hosts in which zoonosis and reassortment can co-occur. Vaccination of these workers against influenza and surveillance for new influenza strains among this population may therefore be an important public health measure. Transmission of influenza from swine to humans who work with swine was documented in a small surveillance study performed in 2004 at the University of Iowa. This study, among others, forms the basis of a recommendation that people whose jobs involve handling poultry and swine be the focus of increased public health surveillance. Other professions at particular risk of infection are veterinarians and meat processing workers, although the risk of infection for both of these groups is lower than that of farm workers.|$|E

2500|$|Ayahuasca is used {{largely as}} a treasured sacrament. [...] <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> {{ayahuasca}} in non-traditional contexts often align themselves with the philosophies and cosmologies associated with ayahuasca shamanism, as practiced among indigenous peoples like the Urarina of the Peruvian Amazon. While non-native users know of the spiritual applications of ayahuasca, a less well-known traditional usage focuses on the medicinal properties of ayahuasca. When used for its medicinal purposes, ayahuasca affects the human consciousness for less than six hours, beginning half an hour after consumption and peaking after two hours. Ayahuasca also has cardiovascular effects, moderately increasing [...] heart rate and diastolic blood pressure. In some cases, individuals experience significant psychological stress during the experience. It {{is for this reason}} that extreme caution should be taken with those who may be at risk of heart disease.|$|E
