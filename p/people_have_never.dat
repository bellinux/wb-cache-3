25|$|Today, Pesach Sheni on the 14th of Iyar has {{the status}} of a very minor holiday (so much so that many of the Jewish <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> even heard of it, and it {{essentially}} does not exist outside of Orthodox and traditional Conservative Judaism). There are not really any special prayers or observances that are considered Jewish law. The only change in the liturgy is that in some communities Tachanun, a penitential prayer omitted on holidays, is not said. There is a custom, though not Jewish law, to eat just one piece of matzo on that night.|$|E

25|$|In the Harry Potter books, the Ministry's {{employees}} {{appear to}} be a largely unelected body. The post of Minister itself, however, is stated to be an elected position. Who has the power to elect or dismiss ministers is never explained. Nevertheless, both the Minister and the Ministry as a whole are seen throughout the Harry Potter series to be highly sensitive to (and reliant on) wizard public opinion, which they attempt to influence via wizarding newspapers. The most functional newspaper is the Daily Prophet, which gives reliable information about politItaly knowledge, and advertisements. Another reliable news source is Witch Weekly, although it focuses less on politics and prison trials than celebrities and advertisements and Quidditch Season. A less than reliable source is the Quibbler, which gives no advertisements, and focuses on fake news, for instance, saying that a star Quid ditch player didn't break his leg, but was bitten by a creature most <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> heard of. In the books, employment with the Ministry can be obtained right after completion of a wizarding education, though different offices require different levels of education and sometimes specific exam results.|$|E

If you can challenge something new, you {{can look forward to}} the public response, be it good or bad." [...] The game introduces gameplay mechanics that are new to the Metroid series. Metroid Fusion offers a more direct, almost mission-based structure that supports the player to explore areas.

Pascu also purchased his own drinking establishment and live music venue, a Bucharest tavern he named Gyuri's Pub, which hosted performances by the Moldovan folk singer Radu Captari.

500|$|Before the 1979 NFL Draft, new [...] San Francisco 49ers {{head coach}} Bill Walsh flew to Morehead State with {{assistant}} coach Sam Wyche {{to work out}} Simms. Walsh was so impressed {{that he planned to}} draft Simms in the third round, preferring him over the quarterback they ultimately took, Joe Montana of Notre Dame. But the New York Giants decided to make Simms their first round pick (seventh overall) to the surprise of many. As Simms acknowledged, [...] "most <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> heard of me." [...] When Simms's name was announced by Commissioner Pete Rozelle in front of the audience at the draft in New York, his selection was booed loudly by the Giants fans in attendance. (He was the second quarterback taken; Jack Thompson of Washington State went to Cincinnati with the third overall pick.) Simms was not happy being a Giant either, [...] "All I was thinking was which teams I would rather play for—the Green Bay Packers, the Kansas City Chiefs, San Diego, San Francisco..." [...] Nonetheless, he became popular with his teammates who jokingly dubbed him [...] "Prince Valiant" [...] in his rookie training camp.|$|E

Gladys Glade and Charlie Sears meet on the train while they are returning home and start a flirtation. Perhaps they would have married in the end, if the old folks hadn't 'butted in.' As it is, they lose all interest in each other. Then the fathers try another tack. They decide to be bitter enemies in public, hoping the opposition will bring the children together. The new plan works like a charm, and Gladys and Charlie, realizing their parents' shortcomings, decide to elope. They do so, much to the satisfaction of Glade and Sears." ...|$|E

500|$|One of Young's first actions was to hire Ray Perkins as head coach. Perkins was an {{offensive}} assistant coach on the Dallas Cowboys under Hall of Fame coach Tom Landry. In his first draft, Young drafted quarterback Phil Simms from Morehead State University with the seventh overall draft pick {{to the surprise}} of many. Simms had never played on a winning team at Morehead State, and acknowledged after he was drafted that [...] "ost <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> heard of me." [...] Young was certain of the choice though saying, [...] "nce in a while {{you get a chance to}} get a guy with a great arm and great potential and you'd darn sight better take it." [...] Simms was unhappy with the selection, and had other teams which he favored playing on over the Giants. The Giants lost their first five games of the season with Joe Pisarcik starting at quarterback. Simms came on in relief of Pisarcik in the fifth game and started the next four, all of which the Giants won. They lost five out of their last seven however, finishing 6–10 for the year. They fell to 4–12 in 1980. Simms play was inconsistent, as he combined for 28 touchdowns against 33 interceptions while completing 48.8% of his passes over his first two seasons.|$|E
