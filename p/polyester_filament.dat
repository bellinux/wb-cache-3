The biocompatibiity of the implants was assessed in detail using light microscopy, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Mechanical tests were made of stability, in comparison with normal joints and controls after excision of the ligament. Some carbon fibre implants broke down in vivo, allowing instability; the fragments caused chronic inflammation. Intact carbon implants did not induce the formation of neoligaments; they were covered by tissue, {{but there was no}} ingrowth. Polyester did not degrade mechanically and supported early collagenous ingrowth within the implant, even in the mid-joint space.
