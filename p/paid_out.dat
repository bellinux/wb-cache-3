5|$|Coinage of eagles {{followed}} {{shortly after}} production of half eagles began, although the exact date is uncertain.

5|$|In the United Kingdom, bookmakers made {{a profit}} out of {{patriotic}} Britons placing bets on a Manchester United victory.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Prairie Village home {{purchase}} fell through, however, the couple's Missouri home caught fire while {{the family was}} out.

5|$|The story survives {{through the}} Hundred Rolls, the great {{survey of the}} English {{hundreds}} made by Edward I, in 1274-5, on returning to his new kingdom from crusade. The scheme, impractical as it might seem, was supposedly based on contemporary sagas of Viking heroes. But the complaints of the local community {{were based on the}} fact that Southchurch had taken all the supplies home to his own manor of Southchurch, received 200 marks from the exchequer, yet never <b>paid</b> <b>out</b> any of what the owners of the goods were entitled to.|$|E
5|$|With {{investment}} subsidies, {{the financial}} burden falls upon the taxpayer, while with feed-in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment subsidies are <b>paid</b> <b>out</b> {{as a function of}} the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance. Some electric companies offer rebates to their customers, such as Austin Energy in Texas, which offers $2.50/watt installed up to $15,000.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced {{theory of}} interest is also presented. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, interest is <b>paid</b> <b>out</b> of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory {{of interest is}} therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, UBS {{announced}} the planned cut of 8,700 jobs and had implemented a new compensation plan. Under the plan, {{no more than}} one-third of any cash bonus would be <b>paid</b> <b>out</b> in the year it is earned with the rest to be held in reserve and stock-based incentives that would vest after three years; top executives would have to hold 75% of any vested shares. Additionally, the bank's chairman, Peter Kurer, would no longer receive any extra variable compensation, only a cash salary and a fixed allotment of shares that could not be sold for four years. In April 2009, UBS announced that it agreed to sell its Brazilian financial services business, UBS Pactual, for approximately US$2.5billion to BTG Investments. UBS rejected proposals to break apart the bank and divest its investment banking division.|$|E
5|$|By 1175, Henry was a royal {{official}} {{in charge of}} purchasing cloth and other items for the royal household. He also was given custody of two estates that had escheated to the crown– Rayleigh in 1181 and Boulogne in 1183. Henry often acted as a purchaser for the king, for example in 1188 Cornhill spent 290 pounds on gold, jewels, furs, and cloth for the king. Henry {{was present at the}} deathbed of Henry II in 1189. The new king, Richard I, kept Henry close and put him in charge of assembling the fleet that Richard needed to go on the Third Crusade. His accounts for his efforts in 1190 in assembling the fleet still survive. These show that Henry bought part or all of 40 ships and <b>paid</b> <b>out</b> a year's wages for over a thousand sailors for the expedition. The total expenses for Henry's efforts totalled over 5,000 pounds.|$|E
5|$|In 1868 and 1869, judgements {{went against}} the Met {{in a number of}} hearings, finding {{financial}} irregularities such as the company paying a dividend it could not afford and expenses being <b>paid</b> <b>out</b> of the capital account. In 1870, its directors were found guilty of a breach of trust and ordered to compensate the company. Although they all appealed and were allowed in 1874 to settle for a much lower amount, to restore shareholders' confidence the directors had all been replaced by October 1872 and Edward Watkin appointed chairman. Watkin was an experienced railwayman and already on the board of several railway companies, including the South Eastern Railway (SER), and had an aspiration to construct a line from the north through London to that railway.|$|E

5|$|In United States v. Amedy (1826), the Court {{held that}} the federal {{criminal}} insurance fraud statute was no subjected to the same formalities as civil insurance fraud claims. First, the Court {{held that the}} state statute of incorporation of the insurance company required {{no more than the}} state's seal to be authenticated. Second, {{there was no need to}} prove the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock had actually been subscribed) because it was not a party. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company. Nor did it matter whether the policy would have <b>paid</b> <b>out</b> under the circumstances of the fraud. Finally, it was held that an insurance corporation was a person within the meaning of the statute.|$|E
5|$|Initial plans {{called for}} {{operations}} to commence on 1January 2000, but this soon proved difficult. In November, NSB <b>paid</b> <b>out</b> {{the other major}} shareholders, and were left with an 89% ownership of the company. The company needed dispensation from the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority to allow temporary employments of engineers. When the company had announced the positions, only one engineer had applied for the twelve jobs. Instead an agreement was made with NSB to rent personnel, thus delaying the start until 3September. But because the engineers needed to be recertified, the start was delayed again, to 5November. In the end, Timetoget was forced to recruit and train new drivers. It received criticism for not having as extensive training as NSB, but the company stated that this would not affect safety. The labor union recommended its members not to apply for jobs with Timetoget, since they did not provide a pension agreement, collective bargaining or guarantees to return to NSB, should the concept fail.|$|E
5|$|Leicester City won the 2015–16 Premier League, {{their first}} {{top-level}} football championship.

Multiple bookmakers had never <b>paid</b> <b>out</b> at such long odds for any sport. The club's previous highest ever finish was second place in the top flight, in 1928–29, then known as Division One. Throughout Leicester's history, they have spent all but one season within the top two leagues of English football. They hold a joint-highest seven second-tier titles (six Second Division and one Championship).|$|E
