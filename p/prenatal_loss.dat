40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on mapping the needs and development of experiencing the <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> integration process in mothers, whose child died during the second or the third pregnancy trimester or suffered stillbirth. The goal of this dissertation is to suggest optimal intervention, which would prevent the progress of complications in terms of psychological disorders (PTSD, PAS). The theoretical part describes <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> from the aspect of incidence and etiology {{and the loss of}} a close relative in general. It also focuses on the specifics of <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss,</b> the topic of crisis and its experience, phases of crisis, definition of the term "psychosocial intervention" and demarcation of its existing forms. This part also offers several perspectives and attitudes to the topic of grief as a process of hard life experience integration. It also describes several phases and problems connected with their fulfillment. The empirical part focuses on surveying the experiences and needs of women, who have suffered with <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss.</b> It also follows the approaches and circumstances, means of support, which helped women to cope with such an experience. It also tries to identify such aspects, which hindered this acceptation or made it more complicated. Research inquiry involves 13 depth interviews, which [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The loss of {{an infant}} through stillbirth, miscarriage, or {{neonatal}} death is recognized as a traumatic life event. Predictors of development of complicated grief after <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> include lack of social support, pre-existing relationship difficulties, or absence of surviving children, as well as ambivalent attitudes or heightened perception {{of the reality of}} the pregnancy. Risk of complicated grief was found to be especially high after termination of a pregnancy due to fetal abnormality. Studies have revealed that men and women show different patterns of grief, potentially exacerbating decline in a relationship.

The ewes (69. 7 %) with LS = 1 had actually lost at least one ovum, against 25. 9 % of the ewes with LS > 1. Ewes grazing Cynodon nlemfuensis (Stargrass) had lower LS than those grazing Digitaria decumbens (Pangola), in relation with a lower nutritional level and, maybe, more parasitism effects. No seasonal or age at lambing effect was shown. The OR and LS were dramatically decreased on local × Lacaune-viande crossbred ewes (minus 1. 32 and 0. 67 unit, respectively, P < 0. 05).

40|$|Objective: To {{give voice}} to the {{experiences}} {{of women who have}} suffered a <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> prior to a full term pregnancy. Design: A descriptive, exploratory qualitative study using mini-biographies was used. In-depth interviews were conducted with women to record their experiences and stories. Interviews were transcribed and the patterns that emerged from the data were identified and themes generated. Subjects: The mini-biographical stories of three women were gathered. Interviews occurred in the women's homes. The women were recruited through an advertisement in the Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Support (SANDS) newsletter. Results: The stories revealed the tragedy, pain and silence endured by these women, as they live with loss and grief. Common themes emerged from their stories highlighting grief, isolation, anger and self-blame in the face of their loss and subsequent full term pregnancy. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: The emergent theme suggests that further research needs to explore how society and the health care community may compound women's grief and isolation and in-turn perpetuate their feelings of anger. In telling their stories, these women {{give voice to}} their experiences and offer a number of insights into how current health care practices may be modified to better support the needs of women who have suffered a <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> and also points to the need for further research. Specifically, the study identifies a need for nurses and midwives to offer sensitive care, acknowledgment of previous loss and supportive counseling strategies for women following <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> and during antenatal care for subsequent pregnancies.

40|$|To the Editor: Among live-births {{generally}} more males are born than females. In Switzerland sex ratio of healthy newbornswas 1. 04 (male to female: 37, 340 to 35, 742) in 2004 [Bundesamt für Statistik, 2005]. Considering the higher <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> rate of males, Huether [1990] extrapolated a sex ratio at conception for whites of approximately 1. 15. Trisomy 18 is a multiple malformation syndrome; {{many of the}} live-born children die during {{the first days of}} life. For fetuses with trisomy 18 diagnosed at amniocentesis (usually at about 16 – 20 gestational weeks), Hook et al. [1983] calculated a fetal survival coefficient of 0. 32. Hook et al.

40|$|Inbreeding {{effects on}} {{reproductive}} outcome vis-a-vis fertility, <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> and prereproductive mortality, and {{secondary sex ratio}} of live and dead children were examined in a large sample of 2078 women of the Vadde fishing population of Kolleru Lake in Andhra Pradesh, India. Demographically, this population is a single endogamous unit. By using an exponential regression model with the proportion of offspring survival as a dependent variable and the inbreeding coefficient as an independent variable, I further examined the inbreeding effects. The results were compared with results from other fishing groups and other southern Indian and non-Indian populations. The results among the Vadde were consistent with those found for other groups of Telugu-speaking fishermen and several other southern Indian populations in that the effects were neither perceptible nor significant. The average B value {{and the number of}} lethal equivalents found for the highly inbred southern Indian populations in general and for the Vadde in particular were much smaller than those {{from other parts of the}} world, providing empirical support to Sanghvi’s hypothesis on long-term effects of inbreeding...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The risk of {{retinopathy}} of prematurity (ROP) {{is associated}} with low birth weight and low gestational age. For ROP screening examination is recommended in infants weighing 1500 g (n = 149) and who required additional oxygen supplementation or underwent surgery with general anaesthesia before estimated term. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, three infants with birth weights between 2080 and 2325 g and a gestational age of 32 or 33 weeks developed stage 2 or 3 ROP. One of these underwent cryocoagulation. In three infants, preterm birth was induced by sudden placental abruption with severe <b>prenatal</b> blood <b>loss</b> followed by haemorrhagic shock. The umbilical cord packed cell volume was reduced to 0. 14 - 0. 19 (normal 0. 43 - 0. 63). All three infants underwent surgery with general anaesthesia within the first weeks of life. Of the remaining 449 infants none with a birth weight > 1650 g developed any stage of ROP. CONCLUSION: Severe <b>prenatal</b> blood <b>loss</b> requiring blood transfusions and surgery with general anaesthesia may induce higher stages of ROP even in infants with birth weights exceeding the usual screening criteria...|$|R
40|$|Concentrations of mouse plasma LH, FSH. {{prolactin}} (PRL) and progesterone {{were measured}} throughout pregnancy {{in a small}} litter size line (CN-) in which prenatal mortality is markedly increased especially at the postimplantation stage. The pattern and magnitude of LH and PRL concentrations in line CN- {{were not significantly different}} from those previously reported in a control line (C). Levels of FSH and progesterone, however, were lower in the CN- than in line C {{during the second half of}} pregnancy. Gonadotropin administration from days 6 through 12 was ineffective in reducing <b>prenatal</b> <b>losses</b> in line CN-, whereas progesterone treatment reduced fetal losses to the level found in line C. Litter size in polytocous species is depend-ent upon the number of ova shed and the proportion of these represented by normal fetuses at birth. Variations in litter size have occurred in mouse strains selected for ovula-tion rate (Falconer, 1960), directly selected for litter size (Falconer, 1960 : Bateman, 1966), and as a correlated response to selec-tion for growth rate or body size (MacArthur...|$|R
40|$|Commercial sows {{experience}} a {{high incidence of}} <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> and substantial variation in birthweight among piglets in a litter. These outcomes negatively impact efficiency and profitability in the swine industry and are hypothesized to result from insufficient endometrial support and placental development during pregnancy. This study examined how glucose and fructose are synthesized, transported, and metabolized at the uterine-placental interface of pigs to support development and growth of the placenta and embryo/fetus. Total tissue mRNA expression and mRNA or protein cellular localization for glucose transporters and polyol pathway enzymes were determined in endometrial and/or placental tissues collected from gilts throughout the estrous cycle and pregnancy. SLC 2 A 1 is the most abundant glucose transporter in the endometrium and is expressed by luminal (LE) and glandular epithelia (GE) throughout pregnancy. SLC 2 A 3 is expressed by trophectoderm/chorion throughout pregnancy. SLC 2 A 5, a fructose transporter, is expressed by LE and chorion after Day 30 of gestation. SLC 2 A 8, a glucose and fructose transporter, is expressed by LE, GE, and select fetal tissues during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy. SLC 2 A 1 mRNA and SLC 2 A 8 protein are upregulated in the uterine epithelia in response to E 2 and P 4. The conversion of glucose to fructose involves aldose reductase (AKR 1 B 1) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD). AKR 1 B 1 is expressed by uterine LE during the peri-implantation period, then by chorion after Day 20. SORD is expressed initially by uterine LE, GE, and trophectoderm, but is barely detectable in the endometrium by Day 20. Ketohexokinase (KHK), which phosphorylates fructose, is expressed by trophectoderm/chorion throughout pregnancy, especially in the tall columnar cells and areolae. These results establish the presence of the molecular components for hexose sugar transport, conversion of glucose to fructose, and fructose utilization at the uterine-placental interface of pigs. The shift in expression of AKR 1 B 1 and SORD from uterine LE to chorion during pregnancy suggests that the free-floating conceptuses are supported by fructose synthesized and secreted into the uterine lumen by uterine LE. After placentation is initiated, the chorion becomes self-sufficient for fructose synthesis and transport to the conceptus. With this knowledge, future studies can be designed to manipulate the availability and transport of hexose sugars across the uterine-placental interface to decrease <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> and variability in birth weights within litters, leading to increased efficiency and profitability for the swine industry...|$|E
40|$|In complex mixture toxicology, {{there is}} growing {{emphasis}} on testing environmentally representative doses that improve the relevance of results for health risk assessment, but are typically much lower than those used in traditional toxicology studies. Traditional experimental designs with typical sample sizes may have insufficient statistical power to detect effects caused by environmentally relevant doses. Proper study design, with adequate statistical power, is critical to ensuring that experimental results are useful for environmental health risk assessment. Studies with environmentally realistic complex mixtures have practical constraints on sample concentration factor and sample volume {{as well as the}} number of animals that can be accommodated. This article describes methodology for calculation of statistical power for non-independent observations for a multigenerational rodent reproductive/developmental bioassay. The use of the methodology is illustrated using the U. S. EPA’s Four Lab study in which rodents were exposed to chlorinated water concentrates containing complex mixtures of drinking water disinfection by-products. Possible experimental designs included two single-block designs and a two-block design. Considering the possible study designs and constraints, a design of two blocks of 100 females with a 40 : 60 ratio of control:treated animals and a significance level of 0. 05 yielded maximum prospective power (~ 90 %) to detect pup weight decreases, while providing the most power to detect increased <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Bent tail is a {{mouse model}} for X-linked neural tube defects (NTDs) that is {{characterized}} by the presence of exencephaly, a delayed posterior neuropore closure, and a tail phenotype. In addition, Bent tail shows laterality defects and increased prenatal mortality. The congenital malformations of this mouse are caused by a submicroscopic deletion that completely encompasses the gene coding for the zinc finger transcription factor Zic 3. In this study we investigated the sensitivity of the phenotype of Bent tail to the nutrients folinic acid, myo-inositol, and zinc. These nutrients are thought {{to be involved in the}} etiology of NTDs, in combination with a genetic predisposition. METHODS: The most penetrant phenotype of the Bent tail mouse, the tail malformation, was used as a marker for the nutrient sensitivity of the neural phenotype. The size of the litters and the survival of the offspring, subdivided according to genotype, were analyzed as markers for the nutrient sensitivity of other phenotypic features of Bent tail. RESULTS: In confirmation of earlier studies, we observed the <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> of a number of homozygous females and hemizygous males, as well as the effect of genotype on the tail phenotype of Bent tail. However, periconceptional supplementation of the maternal diet with folinic acid, myo-inositol, or zinc produced no significant effects on either the tail phenotype of the offspring or the size and genotypic composition of the litters. CONCLUSIONS: Bent tail appears to be a folinic acid-, myo-inositol-, and zinc-insensitive mouse model for NTDs...|$|E
40|$|In this review, {{the causes}} of <b>prenatal</b> <b>losses,</b> {{pregnancy}} termination and reflection of this situation for the parents were investigated. Despite great attention in improving perinatal care, perinatal loss (fetal loss and newborn death) continues to occur. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the perinatal period extends from the 20 th gestational week through 1 month after birth. However, researchers who study perinatal loss use a broader definition that includes early (during the first 12 weeks following conception) as well as late fetal loss (> 20 weeks’ gestation). Of all known pregnancies, an estimated ratio of 12 % to 20 % ends in an early fetal loss. The most recent available data have revealed that the rates translate to about 1. 03 million annual fetal losses and, for 2004, 18. 602 newborn deaths. According {{to the results of}} 2008, infant mortality rate decreased very rapidly in Turkey. Of the many parents who suffer a perinatal loss, at least 80 % become pregnant again, an event that occurs within 18 months. Therefore, it is important for nurses and health care professionals to understand the impact of a perinatal loss on a subsequent pregnancy. The {{purpose of this article is}} to perform an investigation on parental, primarily maternal, responses to pregnancy subsequent to perinatal loss, and to describe nursing implications for parents during the subsequent pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|How many {{human embryos}} die between {{fertilisation}} and birth under natural conditions? It is widely accepted that natural human embryo mortality is high, {{particularly during the}} first weeks after fertilisation, with total <b>prenatal</b> <b>losses</b> of 70 % and higher frequently claimed. However, the first external sign of pregnancy occurs two weeks after fertilisation with a missed menstrual period, and establishing the fate of embryos before this is challenging. Calculations are additionally hampered {{by a lack of}} data on the efficiency of fertilisation under natural conditions. Four distinct sources are used to justify quantitative claims regarding embryo loss: (i) a hypothesis published by Roberts & Lowe in The Lancet  is widely cited but has no practical quantitative value; (ii) life table analyses give consistent assessments of clinical pregnancy loss, but cannot illuminate losses at earlier stages of development; (iii) studies that measure human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) reveal losses in the second week of development and beyond, but not before; and (iv) the classic studies of Hertig and Rock offer the only direct insight into the fate of human embryos from fertilisation under natural conditions. Re-examination of Hertig’s data demonstrates that his estimates for fertilisation rate and early embryo loss are highly imprecise and casts doubt on the validity of his numerical analysis. A recent re-analysis of hCG study data concluded that approximately 40 - 60 % of embryos may be lost between fertilisation and birth, although this will vary substantially between individual women. In conclusion, natural human embryo mortality is lower than often claimed and widely accepted. Estimates for total prenatal mortality of 70 % or higher are exaggerated and not supported by the available data...|$|R

Preg-nancies were maintained in 74 % of the pigs starved during either middle or late gestation compared to 100 % in controls. In dams starved from days 30 - 70, progesterone levels remained similar to controls, but were maintained at lower levels during realimentation between days 72 and 99.

40|$|Background—-Barth {{syndrome}} is a rare, multisystem disorder caused by mutations in tafazzin {{that lead to}} cardiolipin deficiency and mitochondrial abnormalities. Patients most commonly develop an early-onset cardiomyopathy in infancy or fetal life. Methods and Results—-Knockdown of tafazzin (TAZKD) in a mouse model was induced {{from the start of}} gestation via a doxycycline-inducible shRNA transgenic approach. All liveborn TAZKD mice died within the neonatal period, and in vivo echocardiography revealed <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> of TAZKD embryos at E 12. 5 - 14. 5. TAZKD E 13. 5 embryos and newborn mice demonstrated significant tafazzin knockdown, and mass spectrometry analysis of hearts revealed abnormal cardiolipin profiles typical of Barth syndrome. Electronmicroscopy of TAZKD hearts demonstrated ultrastructural abnormalities inmitochondria at both E 13. 5 and newborn stages. Newborn TAZKD mice exhibited a significant reduction in total mitochondrial area, smaller size of individual mitochondria, reduced cristae density, and disruption of the normal parallel orientation between mitochondria and sarcomeres. Echocardiography of E 13. 5 and newborn TAZKD mice showed good systolic function, but early diastolic dysfunction was evident from an abnormal flow pattern in the dorsal aorta. Strikingly, histology of E 13. 5 and newborn TAZKD hearts showed myocardial thinning, hypertrabeculation and noncompaction, and defective ventricular septation. Altered cellular proliferation occurring within a narrow developmental window accompanied the myocardial hypertrabeculation-noncompaction. Conclusions—-In thismurinemodel, tafazzin deficiency leads to a unique developmental cardiomyopathy characterized by ventricular myocardial hypertrabeculation-noncompaction and early lethality.

40|$|Mouse {{models with}} {{prenatal}} alterations in dopaminergic functioning can provide new opportunities to identify fetal behavioral abnormalities {{and the underlying}} neural substrates dependent on dopamine. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> of nigrostriatal function is associated with fetal akinesia, or difficulty initiating movement. Specific behaviors were analysed in fetal offspring derived from pregnant Pitx 3 ak/ 2 J and C 57 BL/ 6 J dams on the last 4 days before birth (E 15 - 18 of a 19 -day gestation). Using digital videography, we analysed: (i) behavioral state, by quantification of high- and low-amplitude movements, (ii) interlimb movement synchrony, {{a measure of the}} temporal relationship between spontaneous movements of limb pairs, (iii) facial wiping, a characteristic response to perioral tactile stimulation similar to the defensive response in human infants, and (iv) oral grasp of a non-nutritive nipple, a component of suckling in the human infant. Pitx 3 mutants showed a selective decrease in interlimb movement synchrony rates at the shortest (0. 1 s) temporal interval coupled with significantly increased latencies to exhibit facial wiping and oral grasp. Collectively, our findings provide evidence that the primary fetal neurobehavioral deficit of the Pitx 3 mutation is akinesia related to nigrostriatal damage. Other findings of particular interest were the differences in neurobehavioral functioning between C 57 BL/ 6 J and Pitx 3 heterozygous subjects, suggesting the two groups are not equivalent controls. These results further suggest that fetal neurobehavioral assessments are sensitive indicators of emerging neural dysfunction, and may have utility for prenatal diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Eukaryotic gene {{expression}} is regulated by several transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. Transcriptional dysregulation of {{gene expression}} {{has been identified}} as important factor in the pathogenesis of many malignant diseases. In contrast, {{little is known about the}} role of posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression in pediatric hematology and oncology. This thesis summarizes my research with respect to molecular characterization of different posttranscriptional mechanisms of gene regulation as well as the relevance of these mechanisms in pediatric hematology and oncology. Neonatal screening of more than 98 % of the newborns in Berlin showed, that the homozygous or double heterozygous risk genotypes for PT G 20210 or FVL are associated with an increased risk for pre- or perinatal thrombotic events but not with thrombophilia during the first 2 years of life. Surprisingly, homozygous genotype for PT G 20210 A was not associated with increased risk for <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> or premature birth but in contrast with a prenatal advantage, possibly by increased implantation efficiency. Expression of several cellular regulatory proteins is controlled by an alternative translation initiation mechanism that allows protein synthesis even during cellular stress. Molecular characterisation of internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) mediated translation initiation resulted in a model lacking initiation factors essential of general translation initiation. Expression of the central inhibitor of apoptosis XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) is regulated via IRES-mediated translation initiation. In childhood ALL, we found a strong posttranscriptional, possibly IRES-mediated, upregulation of XIAP expression. In T-cell ALL, XIAP expression levels are associated with poor response to chemotherapy and poor outcome. Fist data indicate, that XIAP inhibition by small molecules (SMAC mimetics) might present a novel treatment strategy for resistant ALL during infancy and childhood...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Congenital hemihydranencephaly (HH) is a {{very rare}} {{disorder}} characterised by <b>prenatal</b> near-complete unilateral <b>loss</b> of the cerebral cortex. We investigated a patient affected by congenital right HH whose visual field extended significantly into the both visual hemifields, suggesting a reorganisation of the remaining left visual hemisphere. We examined the early visual cortex reorganisation using functional MRI (7 T) and population receptive field (pRF) modelling. Methods: Data were acquired {{by means of a}} 7 T MRI while the patient affected by HH viewed conventional population receptive field mapping stimuli. Two possible pRF reorganisation schemes were evaluated: where every cortical location processed information from either (i) a single region of the visual field or (ii) from two bilateral regions of the visual field. Results: In the patient affected by HH, bilateral pRFs in single cortical locations of the remaining hemisphere were found. In addition, using this specific pRF reorganisation scheme, the biologically known relationship between pRF size and eccentricity was found. Conclusions: Bilateral pRFs were found in the remaining left hemisphere of the patient affected by HH, indicating reorganisation of intra-cortical wiring of the early visual cortex and confirming brain plasticity and reorganisation after an early cerebral damage in humans...|$|R
40|$|Fertility {{rates in}} Pakistan have {{remained}} consistently {{high over the}} past three decades. While numerous studies have examined sociodemographic determinants, the role of biological factors, and particularly consanguinity, has received little attention, even though marriage between close biological relatives continues to be the norm in Pakistan. Reproductive behaviour among women in consanguineous (first cousin) and non-consanguineous unions was compared, using data from a 1995 study of multi-ethnic communities in Karachi and the 1990 – 91 Pakistan Demographic 2 ̆ 6 Health Survey (PDHS). The results show that, although female age at first marriage has been gradually rising in both study samples, women in consanguineous unions married at younger ages and were less likely to use modern contraceptive methods. In the Karachi sample, women in first cousin unions experienced a higher mean number of pregnancies and also reported a higher mean number of children ever born (CEB). However, their mean number of surviving children did not differ from those born to women in non-consanguineous unions, implying higher <b>prenatal</b> and/or postnatal <b>losses</b> in couples related as first cousins. On the other hand, the PDHS showed both lower CEB values for women in consanguineous marriages and a lower number of surviving children. Given the continuing popularity of consanguineous marriage, these findings have important implications for future fertility reduction in Pakistan...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Child Mortality (mortality of {{children}} {{less than five}} years) has declined considerably {{in the developing world}} in the 1990 s, but the Infant Mortality has declined less. Therefore, to further reduce child mortality {{it is important to understand}} the determinants of neonatal and post-neonatal mortality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We probabilistically matched 209628 live births and 3842 infant death records from the City of São Paulo, birth cohort of 1998. Data came from SINASC and SIM. We then used logistic regression to analyze the following risk factors of neonatal and post-neonatal mortality: birth weight, gestational age, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, delivery mode, plurality, sex, maternal education, maternal age, number of prior <b>losses,</b> <b>prenatal</b> care, race, parity and community development. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Infants of older mothers were less likely to die in the neonatal period; infants of adolescent mothers were more likely to die in both periods. Parities four or higher increased the likelihood of post-neonatal death. Cesarean delivery was not found to be associated with infant mortality. Low number of prenatal care visits, low birth weight, preterm birth and low Apgar scores were associated with neonatal death; Low number of prenatal care visits, low birth weight, and low Apgar scores were associated with post-neonatal death. Finally, having a mother live in a highest developed community decreased the likelihood of infant death, suggesting that unmeasured factors are behind such association...|$|R
40|$|Parkinson’s is a {{degenerative}} disease characterized by progressive loss of motor function. Recent evidence suggests insults to the substantia nigra prior to birth {{may be a}} factor in the development of Parkinson’s disease. In the Pitx 3 ak/ 2 J mouse model, over 50 % of the dopaminergic neurons fail to differentiate in the substantia nigra during prenatal development. We hypothesized that <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> of dopaminergic functioning would lead to an early emergence of neural deficits. To test this hypothesis, we used a longitudinal design with behavioral testing and noninvasive quantification of brain metabolites in vivo using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) imaging. We assessed Pitx 3 mice as juveniles and again at 8 weeks of age. The behavioral measures included the open field test, pole climb, and forced swim test. In order to control for behavioral effects possibly introduced by rearing both mutant and control mice together, additional mice from homogenous litters (e. g., all mutant, or all heterozygous) were also tested. MRS of standard brain metabolites were collected from single voxels of 2 x 2 x 2 mm 3 in the striatum using a 7 T Bruker Biospin magnet, Point Resolved Spectroscopy Sequence (PRESS), and variable power RF pulses with optimized relaxation delays (VAPOR) water suppression. The resulting spectra were processed with LCModel, and are the first quantification of brain metabolites reported for the Pitx 3 mouse. As expected, developmental differences in metabolites were detected between juveniles and adults. However, Pitx 3 mutants also showed elevated levels of glutamate in the striatum, suggesting increased dopaminergic loss. Qualitatively different deficits during behavioral testing were also detected between juveniles and adults. Heterozygous mice reared in mixed versus homogenous litters showed gender by rearing condition differences on behavioral tests, suggesting heterozygous males and females are differentially affected by littermates during development. However, no differences were seen in Pitx 3 mutants from either rearing conditions. Together these findings demonstrate the utility of a multi-level approach in longitudinal studies, and reveal for the first time intriguing patterns of development in this mouse model of Parkinson’s disease...|$|E
40|$|Our {{objectives}} were to estimate responses and genetic parameters for ovulation rate, number of fully formed pigs at birth, and other production traits following two-stage selection for increased ovulation rate {{and number of}} fully formed pigs. Eight generations of selection were practiced in each of two lines. One selection line was derived from a line that previously selected eight generations for an index to increase ovulation rate and embryonic survival (the IOL pigs). The other selection line {{was derived from the}} unselected control line of the index selection experiment (the COL pigs). The control line (C) was continued with random selection. Due to previous selection, Line IOL had greater ovulation rate (4. 24 ± 0. 38 and 4. 14 ± 0. 29 ova) and litter size (1. 97 ± 0. 39 and 1. 06 ± 0. 38 pigs) at Generation 0 of two-stage selection than did Lines COL and C. In Stage 1, all gilts from 50 % of the largest litters were retained. Approximately 50 % of them were selected for ovulation rate in Stage 2. Gilts selected for ovulation rate were mated to boars selected from the upper one-third of the litters for litter size. At Generations 7 and 8, differences in mean EBV for ovulation rate and litter size between Lines IOL and C were 6. 20 ± 0. 29 ova and 4. 66 ± 0. 38 pigs; differences between Lines COL and C were 2. 26 ± 0. 29 ova and 2. 79 ± 0. 39 pigs; and differences between Lines IOL and COL were 3. 94 ± 0. 26 ova and 1. 86 ± 0. 39 pigs. Regressions of line mean EBV on generation number were 0. 27 ± 0. 07 ova and 0. 35 ± 0. 06 pigs in Line IOL; 0. 30 ± 0. 06 ova and 0. 29 ± 0. 05 pigs in Line COL; and 0. 01 ± 0. 07 ova and 0. 02 ± 0. 05 pigs in Line C.

40|$|Bereavement of a {{miscarriage}} is complex because {{of factors that}} are unique to this loss. There is no visible child to mourn for, no memories or shared life experiences. The death is sudden and there usually a lack of recognition {{of the significance of}} such a loss by society. In addition, women who miscarry are often in need of the absent social and emotional support that is provided with other types of bereavement. The suppression of appropriate mourning due to society’s inhibitions may cause further stress and long-term emotional consequences. <b>Prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> is unique {{in the sense that the}} parents do not know the object of loss as it would be with the death of a loved one who has been part of their lives and social structure. The anticipated child is both a fantasy child and an internal entity within a woman’s body. The loss of a baby is also the loss of part of a women’s self. The researcher is of the opinion that {{a miscarriage}} is a traumatic experience which, if not thoroughly dealt with, can cause great damage to a sufferer’s life. According to her, projective techniques in the form of play therapy can encourage women to talk about their miscarriage in order to deal with suppressed emotions. The purpose of this research was to determine to what extent projective techniques could be used in respect of a mother’s emotional experience of a miscarriage. For this study the qualitative research approach was used. The participants were selected by making use of purposive sampling as a form of non-probability sampling. During the empiric research two respondents attended eight in-depth interviewes with a therapeutic component. The first interview comprised a semi-structured interview schedule. Six interviews followed where projective play therapeutic techniques were used. The empirical data was obtained from the interview schedule and the researcher was the primer instrument of gathering information. The value of meaning that the participants attached to the subject was of great importance. The empirical data showed that the two participants were better enabled to deal with their miscarriages after the interviews. Thus, regarding the experience of the two paricipants, it was possible to answer the research question positively. It seems as if projective techniques can indeed be used in respect of a mother’s emotional experience of a miscarriage. Dissertation (MA (Play Therapy)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2005.

40|$|Summary 1. Recruitment failure may {{represent}} an important demographic response {{to changes in}} the environment or in population size. In this study, I examined whether there was a positive relationship between recruitment rates and ovulation rates in year t- 1 in eight Norwegian moose populations. Further, I examined how body condition and climate affected the spatiotemporal variation in recruitment rates and ovulation rates. 2. Both recruitment rates and ovulation rates exhibited spatial and temporal variation. The ovulation and twin ovulation rate in yearlings showed more temporal variation than in prime-aged adults. Furthermore, twinning rates varied more than ovulation and calving rates. 3. The number of calves per female recruited to the population was positively related to number of eggs per female the previous year. More calves per female were recorded in years with a high June temperature, smaller snow depths and larger yearling body mass, indicating that more egg cells are realised into a calf in years with good living conditions., 4. Additionally, more calves per female were found in regions with higher number of eggs per female, cool June temperatures and low snow depths. The level of recruitment failure varied among regions, and was highest in Vestfold which is associated with low ovulation rates and body masses. This shows that <b>prenatal</b> or neonatal <b>losses</b> of offspring are likely to be an important demographic response in moose to changes in population size or in the environment...|$|R
40|$|Bovine viral {{diarrhoea}} (BVD) is {{an economically}} important cattle disease with a world-wide distribution that {{is caused by}} BVD virus, a pestivirus of the flaviviridae family. BVD viruses are genetically highly variable. They are classified into two genetic species (BVDV- 1 and - 2) that are further divided into numerous subgroups, particularly for BVDV- 1. The complexity of these viruses is also reflected in their interaction with the host animals. Infections are either transient or persistent and can cause {{a wide spectrum of}} clinical signs, from no or very mild disease to severe forms, reminiscent of viral haemorrhagic fevers. In this work, we have analysed the clinical signs and the pathology of BVD viral infections in a cattle population where different subgroups of BVDV- 1 genotype viruses are endemic. In addition, we have examined potential virulence properties of BVDV- 1 subgroups during persistent infection by comparing the viral subgroups present in clinical cases with those detected in persistently infected (PI) animals sampled for epidemiological criteria, irrespective of their health condition. Furthermore, the clinical and postmortem findings were compared with respect to genetic characteristics of the viruses isolated from these animals. Our results indicate that the BVDV positive animals fall roughly into two categories, depending on the primary organ affected and the age, with lung-centred pathology occurring mainly in young animals and mucosal pathology predominantly in older animals. Furthermore, we found a markedly higher proportion of representatives of the BVDV- 1 e subgroup in stillborn calves and aborted foetuses originating from epidemically unrelated cattle herds, suggesting that BVDV- 1 e may play a special role in <b>prenatal</b> and perinatal <b>losses...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} and {{actual number of}} offspring of roe deer {{and the difference between}} these figures (<b>prenatal</b> and postnatal <b>loss)</b> significantly vary in each population yearly. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine the {{potential and}} actual number of offspring, the number of losses, and to find a link between the most important biological characteristics of does (body weight – BW, condition – KFI) and the number of raised offspring on four territories on the Great Hungarian Plain. Where the number of corpora lutea (CL) is the highest, there the losses are the highest as well, and the number of raised offspring is the lowest (region I.). Here, the rearing loss is double that of the weakest territory (region IV.). Rearing losses can be associated with the fenotype of does (BW, KFI) but environmental factors also have determinative importance. Where the number of twin-calving does was the highest, I found four times more does without a fawn than where the number of twin-calving does was the lowest. The nursing success was the best (the losses were lowest) in the region where the potential offspring (number of CL) was also the lowest, but the coverage of the habitat and the proportion of forests were largest. The food supply for the animals in autumn and winter are not enough, the structure of the habitat has to be improved as well, so that it might become adequate for game protection in extreme weather conditions. The results have to be considered as preliminary ones. It is essential to continue and extend the research to increase the reliability of the results...|$|R
40|$|Background Preterm birth (PTB) is {{the leading}} cause of {{perinatal}} morbidity and mortality. Women with previous <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> are at higher risk of preterm birth. A specialist antenatal clinic is considered as one approach to improve maternity and pregnancy outcomes. Methods A systematic review of quantitative, qualitative and mixed method studies conducted on women at high risk of preterm birth (PTB). The review primary outcomes were to report on the specialist antenatal clinics effect in preventing or reducing preterm birth, perinatal mortality and morbidity and women’s perceptions and experiences of a specialist clinic whether compared or not compared with standard antenatal care. Other secondary maternal, infant and economic outcomes were also determined. A comprehensive search strategy was carried out in English within electronic databases as far back as 1980. The reviewers selected studies, assessed the quality, and extracted data independently. Results were summarized and tabulated. Results Eleven studies fully met the review inclusion criteria, ten were quantitative design studies and only one was a qualitative design study. No mixed method design study was included in the review. All were published after 1989, seven were conducted in the USA and four in the UK. Results from five good to low quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs), all conducted before 1990, did not illustrate the efficacy of the clinic in reducing preterm birth. Whereas results from more recent low quality cohort studies showed some positive neonatal outcomes. Themes from one good quality qualitative study reflected on the emotional and psychological need to reduce anxiety and stress of women referred to such a clinic. Women expressed their negative emotional responses at being labelled as high risk and positive responses to being assessed and treated in the clinic. Women also reported that their partners were struggling to cope emotionally. Conclusions Findings from this review were mixed. Evidence from cohort studies indicated a specialist clinic may be a means of predicting or preventing preterm birth. Testing this in a randomised controlled trial is desirable, though may be hard to achieve due to the growing focus of such clinics on managing women at high risk of preterm birth. Ongoing research has to recognize women’s experiences and perceptions of such a clinic. Further clarification of the optimal referral route and a clear and standardized management and cost economic evaluation plan are also required. Fathers support and experience of PTB clinics should also be included in further research...|$|E
40|$|Successful {{reproductive}} {{strategies are}} important to maximize reproductive output and therefore Darwinian fitness. Superfetation (SF) {{is the ability to}} conceive during an existing pregnancy. For a long time, it has been proposed that SF occurs in the European brown hare. The EBH- populations have been declining across Europe over recent decades. To ensure survival of this species it will be important to understand its reproductive strategies. In this study we initially characterised pregnancy and prenatal development in EBH using ultrasound technology. Furthermore we investigated the occurrence, mechanisms and potential advantages of SF. Data was collected from hares in a breeding colony at the field research station of the IZW over three full seasonal cycles. Altogether 663 and 163 examinations, on 55 females and 34 males respectively, were conducted. A total of 159 pregnancies in 45 females were diagnosed and evaluated. Results and conclusions are summarized: 1. Characterization of EBH prenatal development: During pregnancy long-term ultrasound examinations were carried out to follow the development of the fetus as well as to examine and evaluate the appearance of the reproductive tract of the female. Furthermore, hormonal levels were assessed as well as malfunctions during pregnancy. The collected data was used to develop a comprehensive model of prenatal development in EBH. The model can be used in future studies to assess gestational age when the conception date is unknown. - Mean pregnancy length was 41. 9 ± 0. 8 days (n= 35). - Embryonic loss and resorption occurred in {{more than half of all}} pregnancies. In addition, embryonic retardation was observed in 3. 5 % of all pregnancies. This study provides detailed description for the ultrasound detection and diagnosis of the malfunctions. - During prenatal development nine biometric parameters (embryonic vesicle, biparietal diameter, crown-rump-length, thorax diameter, femur length, kidney diameter, eye diameter, eye lens diameter) were measured. From these parameters growth curves, spanning the entire prenatal development, were calculated using linear and non-linear regression models. Mathematical equations were developed to determine the gestational age in pregnant females. - Ultrasound data was used to define characteristic pregnancy stages. For instance, Corpus luteum (C. ll) of pregnancy and embryonic vesicles could first be detected on day 3 and 6 p. c., respectively. The C. ll. development was followed during the course of pregnancy including postnatal regression. A mathematical model was established describing C. ll. development. The follicular development did not follow a particular pattern. - The serum progesterone (P 4) level followed a characteristic pattern as previously described. On the other hand the serum estrogen (E 2) level did not show any obvious trend. 2. Existence and functional mechanisms of Superfetation: - In permanent breeding pairs mean interbirth interval was significantly shorter than mean pregnancy length (38. 1 ± 1. 1 days (n= 18) vs 41. 9 ± 0. 8 days (n= 35) p< 0. 0001). - In temporary breeding pairs males and pregnant females were bred shortly prior delivery. An additional pregnancy developed in 33 % of these cases. - C. ll. and embryonic vesicles were detected during ultrasound examinations before and shortly after birth, suggesting that an additional conception occurred during pregnancy. The confirmation of C. ll. of different quality in a late pregnant female was a clear sign for the occurrence of SF. - In selected flushings of the oviduct in late pregnant does (n= 6) early embryonic stages(morulae) were found in addition to fully developed fetuses in utero. - SF was induced with a fertile male in 54 % of all possible cases. - To test the hypothesis of additional pregnancies due to sperm storage, late pregnant females were bred with vasectomised males. This did not lead to new pregnancies. However, ovulations were detected via ultrasound. - In addition, paternity tests were conducted via microsatellite analysis, confirming the paternity of the male from the mating of pregnant females shortly prior delivery (n= 5). - SF was successfully induced via artificial insemination(AI) for the first time (n= 6). 3. Effects of Superfetation on reproductive success: - Ovulation rate in pregnancies initiated via SF was significantly higher than in pregnancies initiated without SF (3. 8 ± 1. 1 vs. 3. 0 ± 1. 4, p= 0. 0009), irrespective of the method of insemination. - In 60. 5 % of all SF pregnancies at least one of the pregnancies (preceding or following SF pregnancy) was bilateral. This suggests that unilateral pregnancies with the possibility of sperm passage are not a requirement for the occurrence of SF. - In SF- pregnancies mean litter size was significantly higher compared to non-SF pregnancies (3. 1 ± 1. 1 JH (n= 35) vs. 2. 3 ± 1. 1 JH (n= 96), p= 0. 0003). - There was a clear tendency that SF- pregnancies produced more male offspring than non-SF pregnancies. - No absolute difference in <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> rate was observed between SF and non-SF pregnancies. However, a lower relative rate in <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> was estimated due to increased ovulation and birth rates in SF pregnancies. Conclusions: SF in EBH was frequent under breeding conditions. At the time of birth a new brood was already observed in the oviduct. Paternity tests and breeding experiments with vasectomised males suggest that SF does not occur due to sperm storage. The re-evaluation of data from free-ranging brown hares confirmed that SF does occur in wild hare populations. SF is supposed to be an evolutionary adaptation and probably has a dramatic positive effect on population dynamics. The new results indicate that the old term „superfetation“ has to be re-evaluated and changed to „superconception“...|$|E
40|$|Chromosome {{preparations}} {{were derived}} from short-term cultures of blood lymphocytes and from fibroblast-type cell cultures of subcutaneous fascia obtained from 44 clinically normal horses. The quality of mitotic cells compared favourably with similar studies in other species. Some characteristic morphological features were found which aid in the recognition of certain chromosomes, but the identification of many homologous pairs by conventional techniques was difficult. The normal karyotype of the horse (2 n = 64) was characterized following Giemsa staining and C-banding. The latter procedure was {{shown to be a}} valuable aid for the identification of specific chromosomes, in particular the sex chromosomes. After centromere staining, the X chromosome of the horse is characterized by the presence of prominent C-bands on its long arms, while the Y chromosome appears as an intensely-stained block. Analysis of mitotic chromosomes prepared from ten phenotypically normal but infertile mares revealed, in one animal, the consistent lack of one sex chromosome in the four tissues studied. Centromere staining and sex chromatin studies confirmed that this mare had the karyotype 63 XO. Examination of the genitalia of this XO mare disclosed the presence of apparently normal reproductive organs except that macroscopic follicles were absent from both ovaries. Histologically, a number of presumptive atretic Graafian follicles and a discrete area of apparently functional luteal tissue were discovered in the right ovary. The significance of these findings are discussed and compared with the features of the analogous syndromes associated with the XO anomaly in other species. It is suggested that disorders of the sex chromosomes may occur commonly in horses and may contribute significantly towards the low fertility of the thoroughbred mare. Attention is drawn to the important practical applications of cytogenetic studies in the investigation of infertility in broodmares, and in the certification for sale of young horses intended for use as breeding stock. Cytogenetic studies of spontaneous abortions in women have established that a large proportion of pregnancy wastage in humans is due to chromosome aberrations. The counterparts of many of the chromosome errors initially described in humans have now been reported among domestic animals. In particular, the XO anomaly seems remarkably common among infertile mares. These findings have indicated that chromosomal abnormalities may {{play a significant role in}} the aetiology of spontaneous abortion and embryonic loss in domestic animals. To investigate an hypothesis that chromosome anomalies are an important cause of <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> in the mare, an attempt was made to analyze, cytogenetically, a series of equine abortions. From a range of tissues obtained from 26 aborted foals, cell cultures were prepared but failed to grow, and chromosome analysis was therefore not possible for any of these specimens. It seems that the equine foetus is retained in the uterus of the mare for a considerable period after the foetus has died and usually consists of partially-autolyzed non-vital tissues at the time of its expulsion. Consequently, a study was made of the metaphase chromosomes prepared from 22 equine embryos after their surgical removal from mares' uteri. A normal karyotype was found in each specimen. Although inconclusive on their own, the results of this study form an important contribution towards cumulative studies of embryonic loss in the horse. The current findings are discussed in the light of similar studies of induced abortions in women and embryonic loss in animals, and the potential for further investigation in this field is emphasized. From the limited number of cytogenetic studies in domestic animals, it appears that chromosome analyses, particularly with the aid of more refined techniques such as centromere staining, may be of considerable value in investigations of infertility and embryonic loss in the horse...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: This {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{to investigate the}} causes of childhood blindness and visual impairment in the United States. We also sought a particular etiology [...] congenital lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) [...] which has been considered exceedingly rare, in a fixed target population of children, the severely mentally retarded. METHODS: We undertook a library-based study of the world literature {{to shed light on}} the causes of childhood blindness internationally and to put our data in context. We prospectively examined all consented children (159) at 2 institutions in the United States to determine their ocular status and the etiology of any visual loss present. One of the institutions is a school for the visually impaired (hereafter referred to as Location V), in which most of the students have normal mentation. The other is a home for severely mentally retarded, nonambulatory children (hereafter referred to as Location M). This institution was selected specifically to provide a sample of visual loss associated with severe retardation because the handful of cases of LCMV in the literature have been associated with severe central nervous system insults. Histories were obtained from records on site, and all children received a complete cyclopleged ophthalmic examination at their institution performed by the author. Patients at Location M with chorioretinal scars consistent with intrauterine infection (a possible sign of LCMV) had separate consents for blood drawing. Sera was obtained and sent for standard TORCHS titers, toxoplasmosis titers (Jack S. Remington, MD, Palo Alto, Calif), and ELISA testing for LCMV (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga). RESULTS: The diagnoses at Location V were varied and included retinopathy of prematurity (19. 4 %), optic atrophy (19. 4 %), retinitis pigmentosa (14. 5 %), optic nerve hypoplasia (12. 9 %), cataracts (8. 1 %), foveal hypoplasia (8. 1 %), persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (4. 8 %), and microphthalmos (3. 2 %). The most common diagnosis at Location M was bilateral optic atrophy, which was found in 65 % of the patients examined who had visual loss. Of these, the insults were most often congenital (42. 6 %), with birth trauma, prematurity, and genetics each responsible for about 15 % of the optic atrophy. The second most common diagnosis was cortical visual impairment (24 %), followed by chorioretinal scars (5 %), which are strongly suggestive of intrauterine infection. Of 95 patients examined at Location M, 4 had chorioretinal scars. Two of these had dramatically elevated titers for LCMV, as did one of their mothers. One of the other 2 children died before serum could be drawn, and the fourth had negative titers for both TORCHS and LCMV. CONCLUSIONS: At both locations studied, visual loss was most often due to congenital insults, whether genetic or simply <b>prenatal.</b> The visual <b>loss</b> at Location V was twice as likely as that at Location M to be caused by a genetic disorder. The genetic disorders at Location V were more often isolated eye diseases, while those among the severely retarded at Location M were more generalized genetic disorders. Our study identified optic atrophy as a common diagnosis among the severely mentally retarded with vision loss, a finding that is supported by previous studies in other countries. In our population of severely retarded children, the target etiology of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus was responsible for half the visual loss secondary to chorioretinitis from intrauterine infection. This is more common than would be predicted by the few cases previously described in the literature, and strongly suggests that LCMV may be a more common cause of visual loss than previously appreciated. We believe that serology for LCMV {{should be part of the}} workup for congenital chorioretinitis, especially if the TORCHS titers are negative, and that perhaps the mnemonic should be revised to "TORCHS + L.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Pregnancy compromises impact {{a number}} of infants {{annually}} around the world. These include intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), maternal psychological stress (prenatal stress; PS) and preterm birth (PTB). These compromises can result in alterations to the normal neurodevelopmental process in key brain regions, including the hippocampus, cerebellum and amygdala. These changes in fetal development are being increasingly attributed to the programming of fetal systems in utero towards negative ex utero events. In fetal life, IUGR, PS and PTB cause a delay and/or reduction in mature myelin, concurrent with an alteration in astrocyte activation. Infants born following IUGR, PS and PTB {{are more likely to}} develop cognitive deficits, anxiety, behaviours disorders and schizophrenia. The progesterone metabolite, allopregnanolone is a key neurosteroid involved in fetal development. Allopregnanolone promotes myelination, inhibits astrocytosis, and has allosteric action at the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptor to modulate neural excitability. Allopregnanolone synthesis is upregulated following various acute neurological insults, including hypoxia and stress, protecting against excitotoxic cell death. Inhibition of allopregnanolone synthesis in late gestation, as may occur in chronic pregnancy compromises, reduces myelination and up-regulates astrocyte activation. In later life, dysregulation of allopregnanolone is implicated in several psychological disorders such as depression, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Little information exists on the effect of major pregnancy compromises, their contribution to neurosteroid dysfunction, and neurodevelopmental and behavioural outcomes of the offspring. The effect of inhibiting allopregnanolone synthesis, using finasteride, in late gestation on postnatal cerebellar development was investigated in a guinea pig model. At 8 days postnatal age there was increased astrocyte activation and decreased expression of the allopregnanolone-sensitive GABA A R α 6 subunit in the cerebella of neonates exposed to finasteride. This demonstrates the ongoing effects of a low neurosteroid environment in pregnancy extending into childhood. At 21 days postnatal age, females with in utero finasteride exposure displayed increased neophobia-like responses to changes in their environment. This was without ongoing effects on myelin, astrocyte or GABAergic enzyme expression in the hippocampus or amygdala. These observations suggest that <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> of neurosteroids programs an anxious phenotype in females, possibly by inducing deficits in the end-point targets of allopregnanolone action, and does not impact male anxiety development. A model of combined IUGR+PS was used to investigate neurodevelopmental changes of offspring exposed to multiple pregnancy compromises at term. Circulating allopregnanolone and hippocampal myelination in males, whilst reduced in both IUGR and IUGR+PS, was not cumulatively affected by the combination of stressors. Interestingly, the addition of PS to IUGR had a potentially positive effect on subcortical myelination, suggesting the triggering of a protective mechanism, occurring in the fetal neurodevelopment, to preserve an already compromised brain. The placenta contains all the essential enzymes and is the major contributor to fetal allopregnanolone for neurodevelopment Thus the health of the placenta is critical {{for the development of a}} healthy fetus. Many preterm infants do not survive the immediate neonatal period, with no overt indicators as to poor health. The placenta of surviving and non-surviving preterm guinea pigs were investigated to determine expression of the allopregnanolone synthesis enzymes. The expression of 5 -reductase type 2 was greatest in placentae from neonates that did not survive to 24 hours. This may indicate an upregulation of protective actions to increase allopregnanolone exposure, suggesting these neonates experienced an adverse in utero environment and were therefore more vulnerable to the insult of premature birth. The current body of work indicates that fetal allopregnanolone plays a role in programming GABA A receptor subunit expression as well as juvenile female behaviour, and thus impaired supply of this steroid in utero may be a predisposing factor in the development of depression and anxiety. Allopregnanolone is implicated in the poor development of myelination following IUGR, yet PS may have a neuroprotective action on myelin development in IUGR male brains. Based on this work, it is also postulated that placental expression of neurosteroid producing enzymes provide identification of neonates at risk of poor outcomes in the immediate neonatal period. Further studies investigating the protective effects of PS in IUGR, and their impacts on later behavioural development are warranted. Future work should investigate the potential of perinatal neurosteroid replacement for the improvement of mental health outcomes following pregnancy compromises...|$|E
40|$|A {{radioimmunoassay}} {{system was}} developed to measure plasma concentrations of endogenously produced and exogenously administered progesterone in non-pregnant and pregnant mares in normal and some abnormal reproductive states. Assay sensitivity was 0. 5 ng/ml, with a between assay coefficient of variation of 16. 8 % for a high progesterone sample, estimated over 24 assays, and 8. 5 % for a low progesterone sample, estimated over 15 assays; the within assay coefficient of variation was 7. 3, 10. 1 and 6. 9 % respectively for six replicates of one sample, estimated in three separate assays. Plasma progesterone concentrations of six normal non-pregnant cycling mares followed regular cyclic changes, with levels less than 0. 5 ng/ml during oestrus and ranging between 8 - 22 ng/ml at peak values in dioestrus. The first oestrus following the winter non-breeding period was longer than the following oestrus and the period from ovulation to progesterone decline tended to be less variable {{than the rest of}} the cycle. There was a large between-mare variation in plasma progesterone concentrations in mares at both early and late stages of gestation with levels varying from 4. 9 to 15 ng/ml in the former and 5. 2 to 16. 9 ng/ml in the latter group. No significant effect was noted between stage of gestation and progesterone concentration. A group of five mares all had plasma progesterone concentrations greater than 9. 5 ng/ml within 24 hours prior to parturition; two of these mares sampled within eight hours prior to parturition had plasma progesterone concentrations of 4. 3 and 3. 9 ng/ml. The first post partum sample was taken within 24 hours of foaling; by this time plasma progesterone concentrations had fallen to less than 0. 5 ng/ml and remained low until sampling ceased at the first post partum oestrus. Prostaglandin F 2 α (THAM salt) was effective in causing luteolysis in 13 mares with active corpora lutea before treatment. By three days post-injection 12 of the 13 mares had plasma progesterone concentrations of less than 0. 5 ng/ml and by five days post-injection 12 of the 13 mares were exhibiting oestrus. Of the ten mares bred at the induced oestrus, seven became pregnant to that mating. Plasma progesterone concentrations were measured on 16 non-pregnant mares in anoestrus. Six of eight mares sampled early in the breeding season (September) had plasma progesterone concentrations of less than 0. 5 ng/ml, the other two mares had plasma progesterone concentrations of 0. 6 ng/ml. Eight of eight mares sampled later in the breeding season (November and December) had plasma progesterone concentrations greater than 0. 5 ng/ml, the levels ranging from 6. 2 to 13. 1 ng/ml. Concentrations of plasma progesterone in normal dioestrous mares were measured half and one hourly (three mares) for 24 hours and four hourly (two mares) for 120 hours. There were large apparently random variations, with more than 100 % differences being recorded between a number of consecutive samples. Plasma progesterone concentrations varied from 7. 8 - 23. 0, 3. 2 - 21. 9 and 4. 2 - 12. 9 ng/ml for the three mares sampled half hourly and hourly, and from 6. 8 - 24. 6 and 0. 8 - 11. 0 ng/ml for the two mares sampled four hourly. Radioactive progesterone, administered by venepuncture to a mare with no detectable endogenous plasma progesterone, disappeared from the plasma within 40 minutes; 85 % of the injected steroid had left the plasma by 2. 5 minutes post-injection. Two and 25 mg of progesterone in 16 % alcohol in saline was administered by venepuncture to mares with plasma progesterone concentrations of less than 0. 5 ng/ml. For the mare given 2 mg, the plasma half life of injected progesterone was 1. 75 minutes for the initial "fast" component, and for the mare given 25 mg the plasma half life was 2. 75 minutes. There was a second peak of plasma progesterone at from 8 to 19. 5 minutes for the former and from 9. 5 to 17 minutes for the latter mare. A third much smaller peak was recorded at about 50 minutes post-injection for the mare given 2 mg progesterone. A mare with no detectable endogenous plasma progesterone was administered by intramusuclar injection a total of 600 mg progesterone in arachis oil over a period of seven days. Plasma concentrations of the steroid reached a maximum of 4. 3 ng/ml at one day post-treatment and were maintained at this level for only a maximum of 24 hours. A second mare, again with no detectable plasma progesterone, was administered by intramuscular injection a total dose of 2 g of hydroxyprogesterone capronate in castor oil over a period of ten days. Maximum plasma progesterone concentrations of 1. 2 ng/ml, maintained for less than 24 hours, were reached nine days after the first injection. Wide variation in plasma progesterone levels within and between mares over relatively short time periods suggest that there are many difficulties in identifying "progesterone insufficiency" as a cause of embryonic absorption or abortion in this species. Moreover the short half life of this steroid in the plasma of the mare, together with the sustained high dose levels that would be required to elevate plasma concentrations of progesterone to a level equivalent to that produced by normal secretory corpora lutea, indicate that current levels of administration of this drug are likely to have little effect in overcoming such a breeding problem unless the progesterone is acting at a local level. A definitive answer in respect to this vexed question concerning the existence or not of "progesterone insufficiency" as a cause of <b>prenatal</b> <b>loss</b> in the mare, together with an appropriate method of treatment, still remains to be found...|$|E
