The primary recycling method is re-extrusion, the classical method of recycling PET. This method involves recycling of scrap materials to form original products. However, because various polymers and other materials such as paper, <b>pigments,</b> <b>metals,</b> and adhesives are used as plastic packing materials, this makes recycling by this method difficult.

40|$|Contamination {{of water}} by toxic heavy metals through the {{discharge}} of industrial wastewater is a worldwide environmental problem. Heavy metals form complexes or "ligands" with organic compounds. These modified biological molecules lose their ability to function properly, and result in malfunction or death of the affected cells. Cadmium has many uses, including batteries, <b>pigments,</b> <b>metal</b> coatings, and plastics. Cadmium and several cadmium-containing compounds are known carcinogens and can induce many types of cancer. Long-term exposure to lower levels of cadmium in air, food, or water leads to kidney disease. Other long-term effects are lung damage and fragile bones. Awareness of these effects has led to introduction of more strict legislations to control water pollution. Among the various techniques available to remove metal ions from water, adsorption {{is found to be}} an effective method.

40|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>3</b> D {{printing}} {{has caught}} the attention of many large industries. There have been stories of great success using <b>metal</b> <b>3</b> D printing. Some of the largest industries to successfully use <b>metal</b> <b>3</b> D printing are aerospace and medical. These industries have succeeded with <b>metal</b> <b>3</b> D printing because of their need for light and complex parts. These success stories lead other industries to investigate how <b>metal</b> <b>3</b> D printing or Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) can help them. Industries that are involved in high volume production ask how they {{can take advantage of the}} complexity and customization that is available with 3 D printing. This report explores the feasibility of using <b>metal</b> <b>3</b> D printing in high volume production applications. There are many differences in <b>3</b> D printed <b>metal</b> parts and parts made from traditional methods. The material properties of three DMLS materials are tested and compared to published values and wrought material in this report. Some of the material properties that are tested are: tensile strength, yield strength, Young’s modulus, elongation-at-break, toughness, hermeticity, and hardness. Hydroburst of thin walled vessel and microstructure are also examined. The comparison of these properties shows that the tensile strength, yield strength, Young’s modulus, hardness and elongation-at-break for these three materials are the some order magnitude as wrought material and published values. They do vary from expected results in some cases but they have relatively tight groupings. In most cases the toughness of DMLS parts is 1 / 3 that of the wrought material, except for in the case of the maraging steel, the toughness of the DMLS part is three times higher than the wrought material. The hermeticity and hydroburst results for the DMLS parts are as would be expected from the wrought material. This report explains the specific design techniques that should be followed to get advantage in 3 D printed parts. These techniques include understanding build orientation to reduce support structure, reduce build time and to maximize the parts per build. The geometry of the part can be modified to change how the part deforms while it is being built. A minimum wall thickness of. 5 mm is recommended because of this. There is an advantage in using DMLS for complex tooling in high volume production. With DMLS the complexity of the part is free, so it is often advantageous to create complexity by combining parts, making custom parts or making the part smaller or lighter weight. As people start-using DMLS for tooling in high volume production, these advantages will become clearer. This leads to a new way of thinking. Designers will have freedom to design parts that have never been possible before...|$|R

It is shown that the major features of the electronic structure of both the ground state and the excited states are properly described by a CASSCF wave function based on an active space of the 10 orbitals {{directly involved in the}} metal-cyanide bonding: the 2 t 2 g and 6 e(g) orbitals with mainly <b>metal</b> <b>3</b> d character and their ligand counterparts 3 t 2 g(CNpi*) and 5 e(g) (CNsigma).

In the present study, we investigated the effects of cadmium exposure on sperm quality parameters, fertilization capacity and early embryonic development. Our study showed that in vitro incubation of human or mouse sperms with cadmium for a long time (up to 24 hours) could significantly decreased sperm motility in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Exposure to cadmium in the environment for a short term (30 min) did not affect sperm motility but significantly reduced in vitro fertilization rate. We also evaluated the effects of cadmium at concentrations of 0. 625 μg/ml, and 1. 25 μg/ml on early embryonic development in vitro and observed that the blastocyst formation rate dramatically decreased with increasing cadmium concentration. This finding emphasizes the hazardous effects of cadmium on sperm quality as well as on natural embryo development and raises greater concerns regarding cadmium pollution...|$|R
