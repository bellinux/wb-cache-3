40|$|The {{filtering}} {{function of}} soil {{is an important}} ecosystem service for groundwater and surface water protection. The efficiency of soils as a filter depends on the behaviour of pollutants in the soil and the hydrological transport processes. This paper aims to identify knowledge gaps in processes influencing <b>pollutant</b> <b>behaviour</b> in soils and their potential transport to groundwater. Currently most soil-filter function research is approached from two disciplines, one originating from agronomical/environmental sciences; one from more fundamental hydrological process research. Combining insights and approaches from both disciplines through collaboration could lead to better understanding of this complex system and enhance assessments of management strategy changes, both {{over the long term}} as well as in different climatic settings...|$|E

Concerns are also focused on {{taking into account}} some specific needs for modellers by proposing different output formats and some important information concerning the solid phases, the transformation path, paragenesis and insights into crystallographic details. This additional information aims to avoid considering phases {{that may not be}} "active" under current environmental conditions. The database is especially devoted to environmental applications, ranging from waste material management to <b>pollutant</b> <b>behaviour,</b> including the context of deep underground disposal. Selection rules and conventions are illustrated through the example of the Fe-water system, while a second example details the relationships between low and high ionic strength media, {{from the point of view}} of thermodynamic databases.

40|$|Abstract − This work proposes the {{development}} of an air pollution model based on a joined application of Kalman filter and Kriging technique. The use of modelling techniques in data environmental analysis allows to characterize the <b>pollutants</b> <b>behaviour,</b> in order to validate the measured data and to predict the values of contaminant substances emissions; so it results a very useful analysis tool, especially when there are numerous missing or erroneous data. The joint applications of both Kalman filter and Kriging algorithms allows taking the main advantages of two different methods, in order to improve the performance of the developed model and to reduce its uncertainty too. 1...|$|R

40|$|Recently used {{modelling}} {{of industrial}} air emissions {{does not take}} into consideration the chemical conversion of various pollutants in the atmosphere. This can lead to incorrect assumption about concentrations and composition of waste gases near the recipient, especially in highly polluted urban areas. This is particularly valid for gas emissions being subject to conversion between their points of emitting and final destination. As a result of dispersion modelling of the diffusion, formation and correlation of waste gases emissions from point sources depending on the ambient ozone concentration, ambient air temperature and waste gases temperature, I {{came to the conclusion that}} the physical and chemical characteristics of the ambient air do influence the formation of secondary pollutants at a distance from the emission source. When performing environmental evaluation of certain equipment being a source of air emissions, we should take into consideration the <b>pollutant’s</b> <b>behaviour</b> in relation to the specific environmental features...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSome of the {{meteorological}} approaches commonly {{considered in}} urban air pollution models {{do not take}} into account the importance of the smaller scales in the meteorology of complex-terrain coastal sites. The aim of this work is to estimate the impact of using the proper meteorological scales when simulating the behaviour of the pollutant concentrations emitted in the lower layers over coastal complex terrain areas. The availability of experimental measurements of a power plant plume near the Castellón conurbation (on the Spanish Mediterranean coast) has allowed us to use this plume as a tracer of opportunity of the lower atmosphere to check the results of a simulation exercise using the RAMS mesoscale model coupled to the HYPACT particle model. The results obtained show that in a complex-terrain coastal site, because of the strong effect of the meteorological interactions between the different scales on the integral advection and the turbulent dispersion of pollutants, using an inadequate scale to solve the meteorology can result in a very big gap in the simulation of lower-layer <b>pollutant</b> <b>behaviour</b> at urban scales...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of organic pollutants, after their dispersion in water then their ingestion, {{have a strong}} tendency to accumulate in greases. That {{is due to the}} hydrophobic character of these molecules. To have an idea on the capacity of a substance to accumulate in the alive beings according to their lipidic mass, the modeling of the <b>pollutant</b> <b>behaviour</b> was made by considering its partition coefficient between n-octanol (representing the lipidic mass) and water. Its knowledge represents a very significant information for the petrochemical and the pharmaceutical industries. To dissipate any doubt about confidence concerning the obtained results, it is considered useful to check the effectiveness of UNIFAC method on the monomethylbenzoïc acid such as, for example, the 3 -methylbenzoïc acid whose n-octanol – water partition coefficient is already listed in the literature. The small deviations observed between the n-octanol–water partition coefficients listed in the literature and the one calculated according UNIFAC method encouraged us to apply it in order to predict the n-octanol–water partition coefficient of the dimethylbenzoïc acid...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was to}} improvise the current conventional methods used in air quality assessment so that any unforeseen implicit information can be revealed and the previous research findings can be justified. An analysis based on the daily diurnal curves in place of discrete point values was performed. The analysis results provided evidences of the influence of the change in the climate (due to the El-Nino event), the different levels of different emission sources and meteorological conditions on the severity of the PM 10 problem. By means of the cummulative exceedence index and the functional depth method, most of the monitoring stations for the year 2005 experienced the worst day of critical exceedences on the 10 th of August, while for the year 1997 it occurred between 13 th and 26 th September inclusively at different dates among the stations...|$|E

Both water quality and flow measurements data have been collected from the container terminal (Port of La Spezia), dry bulk terminal and car ferries terminal (Port of Genoa). Laboratory tests have been performed to analyse TSS, TOC, pH, conductivity and heavy metals (dissolved and particulate bound fractions).

40|$|In {{the context}} of the water {{framework}} directive, management plans have to be set up about water quality in surface and groundwater bodies in the EU. One of the first steps is to evaluate the risk of contamination of these water resources, and particularly the risk posed by contaminated industrial sites. From the perspective of water resource management, each of these sites taken individually does not necessary constitute a major threat. However, in heavily industrialised and urbanised areas, the cumulative effect of multiple contaminant sources is likely to present a risk. In order to propose adequate but still economically reliable measures, the calculated risk should be based on a so-called megasite approaches using criteria reflecting the water quality deterioration, in a cumulative way, at the scale of the whole surface water or groundwater body. A GIS-based regional risk assessment approach is developed here for groundwater bodies using the SEQ-ESO currently used within the Walloon Region as indicator to reflect the quality status of the groundwater body. The approach is applied on the groundwater body RWM 073 “Gravels and alluvial deposits of the Meuse river between Engis and Herstal”, identified at risk of not reaching a good quality status by 2015. The different steps of this methodology consist of an inventory of proved or potential contaminating industrial sites, a numerical modelling of <b>pollutants</b> <b>behaviour</b> at the scale of the groundwater body and the application of the SEQ-ESO that finally gives a global quality status of the whole groundwater body. This analysis also serves as basis for a socio-economic approach intending to provide indications on costs and benefits generated by total or partial remediation of the contaminated groundwater bodies according to the different management scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The three Biesbosch Reservoirs are {{pumped storage}} reservoirs, fed with rather {{polluted}} and highly eutrophic {{water from the}} River Meuse. Air injection {{at the bottom of}} the reservoirs prevents thermal stratification, which would otherwise result in serious water quality deterioration. Reservoir mixing also serves as an economic algal control measure; mixing over sufficient depth causes light to play the role of limiting factor and this, combined with zooplankton grazing, keeps the biomass of phytoplankton at acceptable levels. Special problems are caused by benthic, geosmin-producing Oscillatoria species growing on the inner embankment. Rooting up the bottom with a harrow is used as the method of control, based on underwater observations by biological staff trained as SCUBA-divers. With regard to <b>pollutant</b> <b>behaviour</b> the three reservoirs act as a series of fully mixed reactors. This enables the application of kinetic models to describe their behaviour and allows the use of a selective intake policy, e. g. for suspended solids with associated contaminants, ammonia and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. A combination of selective intake and self- purification processes - enhanced by the compartmentalisation of the storage volume in three reservoirs - leads to a striking improvement for many water-quality parameters...|$|E

40|$|Indoor air {{contains}} a complex mixture of bioaerosols such as fungi, bacteria and allergens, {{as well as}} non-biological particles including products from various combustion processes. To date little {{work has been done}} to investigate interactions and associations between particles of biological and non-biological origin, however, any occurring interactions could affect <b>pollutant</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the air and ultimately the effect they have on health. The aim of this work was to examine associations between the concentration levels of airborne particles and fungi measured in 14 residential suburban houses in Brisbane. The study showed that no statistically significant associations between the fungal spore and submicrometre particle concentrations or PM 2. 5 were present, while a weak but statistically significant relationship was found between fungal and supermicrometre particle concentrations. A similarity in behavior between the submicrometre particle and fungal spore concentrations was that the fungal spore concentrations were related directly to the distance from the source (a nearby park), in a very similar way in which the submicrometre particles originating from vehicle emissions from a road, were dependent on the distance to the road. Recommendations have been provided as to the future study designs to gain a deeper insight into the relationships between biological and non-biological particles...|$|E
40|$|Urban {{air quality}} {{assessment}} requires {{the knowledge of}} the temporal and spatial structure of the mixing layer, because this structure controls the vertical dilution of near-surface <b>pollutants.</b> The <b>behaviour</b> of the mixing layer is a consequence of vertical temperature and moisture profiles in the lower atmosphere so that remote sensing can be a suitable tool to monitor it. Three ceilometers, a Vaisala LD 40 and two Vaisala CL 31, have been operated for many months in the German city of Augsburg in order to observe the vertical aerosol distribution. Wind and temperature profile information have been obtained for a part of the period from radio-acoustic sounding system (RASS) observations. This paper investigates the abilities of the instruments and compares the information received by the ceilometers among each other and with temperature profiles from the RASS data...|$|R

The catalyst monolith is modelled using a novel hybrid approach. Individual channels {{at the entrance to}} the substrate provide an accurate description of ow upon entrance to the monolith. A porous region then applies the macroscopic pressure drop on the fully developed ow. Flow predictions are compared with experimental data in the diuser and downstream of the monolith. Overall, the hybrid model improves upon the separate use of the two approaches. The variance of downstream velocity predictions from experimental data is decreased by up to 50 % compared to the porous medium model, whilst the computational demand is reduced by approximately one order of magnitude compared to the individual channels model...|$|R

Its impact on benthic communities and persistent organic <b>pollutant</b> (POP) <b>behaviour</b> in lakes is not known. Benthic invertebrate communities responded to slumps through changes to community composition and size spectra. Larger taxa tended to dominate in lakes with slumps. Variability in biomass size spectra was related to total dissolved nitrogen concentration and slump size. Concentrations of POPs in Gammarus were negatively correlated with total phosphorus and positively correlated with {{the percentage of the}} catchment slumped. Lakes with slumps generally had higher mean concentrations of POPs in Gammarus (ex.

Benthic invertebrate biomass was also negatively correlated with concentrations of contaminants in Gammarus, supporting the biomass dilution hypothesis. Thaw slumps have large enough impacts on the physico-chemical characteristics of lakes that they alter benthic invertebrate community composition and size-structure, and contaminant concentrations in Gammarus...|$|R

The conceptual model {{can be applied to}} groundwater status risk assessment and pollution risk assessment at the local scale, thus satisfying both environmental and preventative/limitation objectives of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and Groundwater Directive (GWD). Its main purpose is to apply a risk assessment procedure, according to the WFD requirements, and to serve as a foundation for setting up a numerical model of flow in both the saturated and unsaturated zones in order to identify pressure and impact effects on groundwater quality. The model is divided into two parts, taking into account the WFD requirement to assess a risk {{for a wide range of}} source-pathway-receptor relationships. The Global Conceptual Model (GCM) provides insight into the processes and pressures at the level of the groundwater system. It contains the geological and hydrogeological characterization of the Zagreb aquifer system and the description of the most significant point and diffuse sources and pathways of pollution and processes influencing <b>pollutant</b> <b>behaviour</b> in saturated and unsaturated zone of the groundwater system. The main pollutants of the Zagreb aquifer system are potentially toxic metals, nitrates, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and chlorinated aliphatics. A Local Conceptual Model (LCM) supports parameterization of the whole groundwater system through the description of heterogeneities and flow and solute parameters of the system components at two sites representing local conditions in the saturated (Stara Loza) and unsaturated (Kosnica) zones. This concept can be regarded as an effective tool for groundwater management of the groundwater system and its compartments and for communicating the conditions in complex groundwater systems with experts, policy makers and general public in an understandable way...|$|E
40|$|This {{study on}} water quality {{modelling}} in Sungai Juru, Penang was undertaken {{as one of}} the most polluted rivers in Malaysia and is literally known as the ‘dying river’. The research objectives are to assess the parameters that govern the amount of pollutants in the river and to identify appropriate measures to improve the river water quality. The main pollution sources are pig waste, discharge from agro-based industries, dumping of municipal and industrial waste. Due to its relatively flat bed gradient, Sungai Juru experienced tidal effect up to a distance of 13 km from the estuary. As a result, pollutants in the river are hardly discharged into the sea. This research on Dissolved Oxygen (DO) parameter has been carried out to develop a rehabilitation solution for Sungai Juru by using the numerical hydrodynamic modeling technique simulated by I-D Infoworks R. S software. The modeling involved two phases namely, development of a flow model followed by a water quality model. After the model has been successfully calibrated, the <b>pollutant</b> <b>behaviour</b> under various scenarios can be investigated. The hydraulic study of Sungai Juru revealed that the velocity at STJ 02 ranging from - 0. 1 to + 0. 12 m sec - 1 during high and low tide, respectively. Based on this velocity, traveling time from S TJ 02 (Sungai Juru) to STJ 01 (Sungai Rambai) (3. 5 km) is approximately between 9 - 10 h. The duration provides ample time for photosynthesis to occur resulting high DO ranging from 4 - 10 mg at STJ 01. The information is useful to determine pollution characteristics in Sungai Juru particularly related to tidal impacts. It is hoped that the modeling technique developed can be applied in other rivers in Malaysia which are subjected to tidal influences...|$|E
40|$|Study of the {{relationship}} between plant litter-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) and organic pollutant transport in soil is important for understanding the role of forest litter carbon cycling in influencing <b>pollutant</b> <b>behaviour</b> and fate in forest soil. With the aim of providing insight into the capacity of plant litter-derived DOM to influence sorption and desorption of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on soil, batch experiments were carried out with application of a sorption-desorption model incorporating DOM effects. Freshly fallen pine (Pinus elliottii) needles were used as the source of organic matter. Input of the pine needle litter-derived DOM was found to significantly decrease desorption hysteresis as well as soil adsorption capacity of phenanthrene (PHE) and fluoranthene (FLA). Addition of 1 728 mg L− 1 dissolved organic carbon (DOC) lowered the organic carbon-normalized sorption distribution coefficient of PHE from 7 776 to 2 541 L kg− 1 C and of FLA from 11 503 to 4 368 L kg− 1 C. Decreases of the apparent sorption-desorption distribution coefficients of PHE and FLA with increased DOC concentration indicated that DOM favored desorption of PAHs from soil. Increases in the fraction of apparently dissolved PAHs were attributable to the dissolved PAH-DOM complexes, accounting for the dissolved proportions of 39 % to 69 % for PHE and 26 % to 72 % for FLA in the sorption and desorption processes as the concentration of the added DOM solution rose from 0 to 1 728 mg L− 1. Our results suggest that pine needle litter-derived DOM can have a substantial effect of inhibiting PAHs sorption and promoting PAHs desorption, thus leading to enhanced leaching in soil, which should be taken into account in risk assessment of PAHs accumulated in forest soil...|$|E
40|$|The {{complex system}} of {{interactions}} between basic environmental components is very often complicated by anthropogenic pollution. Petroleum hydrocarbons and {{volatile organic compounds}} represent the most frequent pollutants {{in the area of}} the Czech Republic. Our attention was therefore focused especially on these substances. Model reference locality of ELSTAV, Ltd. on Jílkova Street in Brno (former MEZ) was chosen for the monitoring of capture, release, degradation, persistent fixation and migration of dangerous pollutants (VOC - volatile organic compounds and TPH - total petroleum hydrocarbons) under surficial conditions of incoherent sediments.

Energy efficiency improvements in housing can help protect against the adverse health effects of low and high temperatures and outdoor air pollution; transport interventions, especially ones that entail increased walking and cycling, can help improve physical activity and the urban environment; and switching to low carbon fuels to generate electricity can reduce air pollution-related health burdens.

40|$|Despite {{progress}} in air pollution control, concerns remain over the health impact of poor air quality. Governments increasingly issue air quality information to enable vulnerable groups to avoid exposure. Avoidance behaviour potentially biases {{estimates of the}} health effects of air <b>pollutants.</b> But avoidance <b>behaviour</b> imposes a cost on individuals and therefore may not be taken in all circumstances. This paper exploits panel data at the English local authority level to estimate the relationship between children's daily hospital emergency admissions for respiratory diseases and common air pollutants, while allowing for avoidance behaviour in response to air pollution warnings. A 1 % increase in nitrogen dioxide or ozone concentrations increases hospital admissions by 0. 1 %. For the subset of asthma admissions – where avoidance is less costly – there is evidence of avoidance behaviour. Ignoring avoidance behaviour, however, does not result in statistically significant underestimation of the health effect of air pollution...|$|R
40|$|Different physical, {{chemical}} and biological processes influence the behaviour of organic contaminants in soils. A {{better understanding of the}} organic <b>pollutant</b> <b>behaviour</b> in soils would improve the environmental protection. One possible way for better attenuation of the risk of pollution in agriculture can be achieved through ta better-specified pesticide management based on the adaptation of the pesticide type and application rates to the specific environmental characteristics of the area of application. Nowadays, one of the actually most applied herbicide world wide is glyphosate. Glyphosate is highly water soluble and traces have been found in surface and groundwater systems. For {{a better understanding of the}} natural influence of erosion processes on glyphosate behaviour and dispersion under heavy rain conditions after application in the field, two erosion simulation experiments were conducted on two different locations in Austria with completely different soil types in September 2008. The results of the experiments showed that under normal practical conditions (e. g. no rainfall is expected immediatly after application), the potential adsorption capacity of the Kirchberg soil (Stagnic Cambisol, with about 16. 000 ppm Fe-oxides) is confirmed compared to the low adsorption Chernosem soil (about 8. 000 ppm pedogenic Fe-oxides).   Considering the enormous difference in the run-off amounts between the two sites Pixendorf and Kirchberg soils it can be concluded how important the soil structural conditions and vegetation type and cover are for the risks of erosion and, as a consequence, pollution of neighbouring waters. In the rainfall experiments under comparable simulation conditions, the amount of run-off was about 10 times higher at Kirchberg, owing to its better infiltration rate, than at the Pixendorf site. Moreover, the total loss of glyphosate (NT+CT) through run-off at the Kirchberg site was more than double that at Pixendorf, which confirms the importance of the {{chemical and}} mineralogical nature of soils in the abatement and absorbency of glyphosate, and the poor results in case of erosive precipitations whwn soil structure and permeability are not favourable...|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} {{over a period of}} one year on measurements of air pollution in the Shuaiba Industrial Area (SIA) of Kuwait. The study included analysis of <b>pollutant</b> <b>behaviour</b> relative to the wind speed and direction. SIA comprises several large scale industries including three petroleum refineries, two power plants, two fertilizer plants, a cement plant, a chlorine and soda plant, a commercial harbour and two large oil loading terminals. Measurements of 15 parameters have been carried out every 5 minutes using a mobile laboratory fitted with an automatic calibrator and a data storage system. The pollutants studied include methane, non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides (NO, NO 2, and NOx), sulphur dioxide, ozone and suspended dust. Meteorological parameters monitored simultaneously include wind speed and direction, air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and barometric pressure. The air quality data collected using the mobile laboratory have been used to calculate the diurnal and monthly variations in the major primary and secondary pollutants. Distribution levels of these pollutants relative to wind direction and speed have also been used in the analysis. The results show large diurnal variations in some pollutant concentrations. Generally, two types of concentration variations have been found, depending on whether the species is a primary or a secondary pollutant. Diurnal variations with two maxima were observed in the concentrations of primary pollutants including NO, SO 2, NMHC, CO and suspended dust, whereas a single maximum was observed for secondary pollutants such as O 3 and NO 2. The monthly variations of SO 2 and NOx showed maximum values during the warm months. However, ozone showed a quite marked seasonal variation with maxima during spring and late summer and a minimum during the early summer. The results also indicated a common source for NOx, SO 2, NMHC, CO and suspended dust to the North-West (NW) of the monitoring station. Moreover for NOx and SO 2, another less significant source is to the South-South-West (SSW) and South-West (SW) of the monitoring station...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{transport}} behaviour of pollutants {{is key to}} enhance remediation strategies and to inform predictive models of <b>pollutant</b> <b>behaviour</b> in environmental and engineered systems. This work investigates magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a methodology for imaging heavy metal, molecular and nanoparticle transport in two different saturated porous systems: biofilms and saturated porous geologic media (gravel). While most renowned for its use in medicine, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is enabling us to image {{the transport}} of heavy metals, macro-molecules and nanoparticles inside biofilms and porous columns in real time. This is achieved using either ions which are paramagnetic (e. g. Cu 2 +) or molecules labelled with paramagnetic ions (e. g. Gd 3 +) or superparamagnetic (e. g. nanomagnetite) nanoparticles. Presence of these tracers causes a concentration dependent shortening of relaxation times (T 1 or T 2) of the surrounding 1 H nuclei and thus creates noticeable changes in the MRI signal. Critically, this enables the transport of (super) paramagnetic ions, molecules or nanoparticles through the biofilm or porous geological media to be imaged. Moreover, the actual concentrations of molecules can be quantified, as changes in relaxation rates have a linear relationship with the concentration of the tracer molecules. Hence, MRI can be used not only to track but also to quantify the transport of (super) paramagnetic molecules inside biofilms and saturated porous columns. The key advantages of MRI over other techniques are its ability to image inside systems opaque to other methods {{and its ability to}} collect data non-invasively, hence the system is unperturbed by the analysis. In this study, the transport of Gd-DTPA, a commonly used MRI contrast agent, was successfully imaged through phototrophic biofilms of 10 and 2. 5 mm thicknesses. To improve spatial resolution, for the 2. 5 mm thickness biofilm, a bespoke 5 mm diameter RF coil was constructed. The comparison of spatially distributed, time-varying concentrations of Gd-DTPA inside the biofilms with diffusion models illustrated that transport was via both diffusion and advection. This work illustrated the potential of using paramagnetically labelled molecules to quantify molecular pollutant transport and fate in biofilms. MRI was also used to image heavy metal trasport in artificial biofilms (composed of agar and bacteria) to test the suitability of an existing adsorption-diffusion model to represent heavy metal transport and fate in biofilms. While the diffusion coefficients and adsorption constants estimated were appropriate, discrepancies between the model and the data illustrates models may need to be developed further to incorporate factors such as concentration dependant diffusion or cell lysis. Finally, the ability to image inside opaque systems was further exploited to image nanoparticle transport inside a coarse-grained packed column. This was undertaken to illustrate the potential for MRI to image nanoparticle pollutant transport in systems relevant to river beds and sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS). MRI was successfully used to image the nanoparticle transport, with significant transport inhibition was observed in positively charged nanoparticles compared to negatively charged nanoparticles due to permanent attachment...|$|E
40|$|Human-induced {{perturbations}} such as crude-oilpollution {{can pose}} serious threats to aquatic ecosystems. To understand these threats fully {{it is important}} to establish both the immediate and evolutionary effects of <b>pollutants</b> on <b>behaviour</b> and cognition. Addressing such questions requires comparative and experimental study of populations that have evolved under different levels of pollution. Here, we compared the exploratory, activity and social behaviour of four populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) raised in common garden conditions for up to three generations. Two of these populations originated from tributaries with a long history of human induced chronic crude-oil pollution with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons due to oil exploitation in Trinidad, the two others originating from non-polluted control sites. Laboratory-raised guppies from the oil-polluted sites were less exploratory in an experimental maze than guppies from the non-polluted sites and in a similar manner for the two independent rivers. We then compared the plastic behavioural responses of the different populations after an acute short-term experimental exposure to crude oil and found a decrease in exploration (but not in activity or shoaling) in the oil-exposed fish compared to the control subjects over all four populations. Taken together, these results suggest that both an evolutionary history with oil and an acute exposure to oil depressed guppy exploratory behaviour. We discuss whether the behavioural divergence observed represents adaptation to human-induced pollutants, the implications for conservation and the possible knock-on effects for information discovery and population persistence in fish group...|$|R

Different non-destructive and efficient investigation tools are used (XRD, SEM, µ-XRF, XAFS). Data are then introduced in a reactive transport modelling code (CHESS-HYTEC) to validate the experimental results and then to predict pollutants release with time. Waste, which may contain pollutants, is usually valorised as natural materials substitutes or as energy source. The products are in many cases in permanent contact with water and are likely to be altered and therefore to release pollutants in environment. To assess environmental behaviour of the products, i. e. long-term evolution of the solids, our methodology combines the determination of the structural and crystal-chemistry evolution of the solid matrix down to the molecular level to a modelling approach of leaching experiments at macroscopic scale (laboratory and field tests). The evolution of the pollutants (i. e. oxidation state and retention sites) together with the evolution of the matrix mineralogy are studied using non-destructive and efficient investigation tools (XRD, SEM, µ-XRF, XAFS). Results are translated into thermodynamic data, which are introduced in a reactive transport modelling code (CHESS-HYTEC) to test the proposed speciation model and then to predict <b>pollutants</b> long-term <b>behaviour.</b> This work introduces the behaviour of a Cr(VI) -doped Portland Cement (2000 mg/kg) during leaching. In the altered layer of the cement, the ettringite mineral retains Cr(VI), probably as sulphate substitute. When ettringite is dissolved at the leachate-cement interface, Cr(VI) would be retained by another mineral: hydrotalcite. The model reproduces very well Cr(VI) retention by ettringite and also, the presence of another bearing-phase at the leachate interface, as ettringite dissolves. The methodology applied here is efficient and necessary in term of long-term behaviour prediction problem, especially when complex matrices are considered and when the pollutants concentration is below their oxide or hydroxide solubility limit...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{changes have}} become always more frequent, {{increasing}} {{the interest of}} researchers in finding the causes and, above all, the structural or non-structural solutions to solve the problem. Economic development together with rapid population growth constantly increase the demand of goods and services. As the same as drought, also precipitation became more intense and frequent, even with more ever short duration. These events for their heavy impact are called ‘extreme rainfall events’. The actual management of urban waters is unsustainable thus, foregoing reasons lead to an imperative need to develop new urban ecosystems, requiring a rethink of traditional development techniques. Traditional urban drainage systems are designed to rapidly collect and convey overland flows to the treatment plants, without taking into account of their qualitative characteristics. In order to reach {{the aim of the}} qualitative and quantitative control of stormwater in urban areas, a possible way is the widespread implementation in urban areas of ‘blue-green infrastructure’ that provide an holistic and integrated approach to the problem. They are one step beyond other ‘classic’ sustainable urban drainage measures such as LID (Low Impact Development), SUDS (Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems) or BMPs (Best Management Practices), allowing to emphasize their beneficial effects. Use of BGC as a part of sustainable drainage system concept is a winning approach, that allow managing and treatment of stormwater runoff within urban areas, using practices made of green and blue components. Generally green components are represented by any kind of existing vegetation (floral plants, grass, hedges) while the blue one by lakes, ponds, rivers and canals (natural or artificial). Together, these infrastructures allow to create a network between them at regional scale. The real behaviour of these structures is not yet properly modelled. Most of the software currently used in urban hydrology (SWMM by EPA, Music by eWater CRC, etc…) model in a reasonable way the hydraulic behaviour of infiltration practices (such as bioretention cells, infiltration trenches, vegetated filter strips, porous pavement) using a simple mass balance approach. Generation, inflow and transport of pollutants are, instead, determined by the land use assigned to each subcatchments, namely through buildup and washoff laws describing accumulation and washout by either a mass per unit of subcatchment area or per unit of curb length. This approach completely lack of quality algorithms within LID models that take into account of their quality performances as, for instance, reduction of efficiency due to the clogging effect. The clogging phenomenon, described as the decrease in infiltration rate of the soil due to the reduction in soil porosity and hydraulic conductivity, occurs for the majority within infiltration practices such as bioretention cells, infiltration trenches, vegetated swales and permeable pavers. Precisely these latter practices are one of the easiest to implement into urban environment, being aimed to reduce impervious areas and work as ‘link’ within BGCs networks. From these premises the research in the following thesis is developed, whose main objective is to study the implementation of 'blue and green' elements in urban areas and their effect on pollutant loads reduction. Initially, a study of common errors retrieved within a DTM (Digital Terrain Model) has been faced because, if not corrected, they will affect the overland flow network generation and the subsequent hydraulic modelling. DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) can include both terrain elevation data, which commands flow direction of floodwater, and land cover information, which dictates resistance to floodwater distribution. Very often DTMs originate from a variety of ground observations supplemented by various remote sensing techniques (aerial and satellite measurements, total stations, dGPS, aerial LiDAR, terrestrial laser scanning) thus, containing systematic or random errors to individuate and eliminate. A study were carried out to evaluate how DTM resolutions and presence of building affect overland flow network delineation in the Liguori Channel basin, situated in Cosenza (Italy). To achieve this aim, three different DEMs of the study area, generated from different sources, were used: two contour-based DTMs with contour interval respectively of 30 m (DTM 30) and 20 m (DTM 20), and one LiDAR-based DEM, with horizontal resolution of 1 m (LIDAR DTM). Moreover, for a more in depth analysis, LIDAR DTMb (with buildings) cell size has been down sampled from 1 to 5 meters coarse resolution, in order to evaluate also, how cell size affect ponds delineation. Individuation of likely flood areas (ponds) has been carried out using Arc Hydro Tools developed at Centre for Research in Water Resources at University of Texas at Austin. Research highlighted how the correction of DEM generated from LiDAR data and other sources overlapping the buildings (i. e. retrieved from cadas maps) help to diminish the total accumulated water volume into surface ponds, real or spurious, and also that their number does not depend by the raster cell size, but from the accuracy of the source data. Afterwards, a first attempt of best management practices implementation has been carried out within the Liguori Channel situated in Cosenza, Italy. The overland flow network of a highly urbanized sub area has been enhanced through the addition of a certain percentage of green roof and porous pavements. A series of simulations were carried out, using in input the historical annual rainfall series (between 2008 and 2011) and considering a first scenario without LIDs (reference case) and a second scenario with the new practices implemented. Moreover, the same simulation were repeated in continuous, namely considering a single time series composed by 4 years of precipitations (2008 - 2011) and taking into account, in addition to the two previous cases, of a third scenario where LIDs may deal with clogging phenomenon. In order to perform the EPA SWMM modelling, a ‘residential’ land use has been defined, characterised by build-up and wash off laws for the considered pollutant (Total Suspended Solids – TSS). As regards the green roof and porous pavement simulation parameters, currently these values has been gathered from literature. Within SWMM, the clogging phenomenon is taken into account through a parameter called ‘clogging factor’ that considers the possible decay of LID performance due to the fine material carried by infiltration waters. The empirical formulation is affected by some parameters such as the number of years it takes to fully clog the system (Yclog), the annual rainfall amount over the site (Pa), the pavement's capture ratio CR (area that contributes runoff to the pavement divided by area of the pavement itself), the system's void ratio (VR), the Impervious Surface Fraction (ISF) and the pavement layer thickness (T). The yearly simulation performed show how the percentage reduction of volumes into the network is around 35 % on average each year, the mass of Total Suspended Solids is around 30 % on average while the relative concentration undergoes an increment around 15 %. The latter result can be explained looking at the SWMM runoff quality algorithm. In fact, currently SWMM takes into account of the reduction of pollutants only in terms of reduction of overland flow, due to the lacking of quality algorithms for LIDs simulation. Consequently, the presence of BMPs increases the amount of stormwater that infiltrates, decreasing runoff, therefore the mass of pollutants reaching the sewer outlet. The lower is the volumes of water reaching the sewer, keeping constant the total mass of pollutant over the catchment, the higher is the average outlet concentrations. The results of the continuous simulation are, also, very interesting. While during the annual simulations the trend of volumes for the scenario ‘LIDs with clogging’ ranges always between the other two cases, without and with LIDs, when the continuous simulation is considered, the volumes of the clogged LID are even higher than the volumes occurring without any BMP implemented. The efficiency tends to decrease during time, from 50 % when simulation starts to almost 0 % {{at the end of the}} second year, continuing then to swing around zero per cent for the remaining part of the simulation. In this case, in fact, during the first two simulated years the trend is similar to what it has been found during the annual simulation, while starting from the third year (January 2010), volumes generated for the case ‘LIDs with clogging’ are equal or even higher than those ones generated when no LIDs are used. Although EPA SWMM results are interesting and indicative of LID operation, they are not very accurate, especially concerning the qualitative simulation of the stormwater management practices. For this reason, later, the research has been focused on improving the qualitative simulation algorithms, with particular attention to porous pavements. Data collected into an experimental laboratory rig of three different and widely used permeable pavement types has been analysed. The investigated systems were: monolithic porous asphalt (PA), modular Hydrapave (HP), and monolithic Permapave (PP). The rig, made of three vertical compartments in which the three porous pavers stratigraphies has been rebuilt, has been subjected to a semi-synthetic hyetograph, made of five different rain intensities (wetting regime) plus several drying periods. From the frequency curve typical of Brisbane (AU), in correspondence of different percentile ranges four flow rates has been chosen (A, B, C, D). In addition, a 1 in 5 year storm of 5 min duration was selected; this represents the typical design storm where the porous pavers are likely to be developed. The accelerated laboratory test allowed to simulate 26 years of operation under Melbourne climate. About the water quality monitoring, an intense sampling regime has been conducted in which samples were collected from inflow and outflow and analysed for Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Total Phosphorus (TP) and Total Nitrogen (TN). Afterwards, a correlation analysis has been performed in order to individuate the key variables affecting the porous pavement functioning. According to these results, the key variables identified to affect the pollutant concentration values were: the cumulative flow every 6, 12 and 24 hours before the sampling time, the cumulative inflow volume in each time step and the cumulative trapped mass. Initially, it has been tried to analyse the phenomenon through the ‘k-C* model’, that is a conceptual model used to simulate the <b>pollutant</b> <b>behaviour</b> through the system, based on a first-order kinetic decay equation. Notwithstanding the wide popularity and tested applicability on various other treatment practices such as sand filters, wetlands, ponds, infiltration systems and vegetated swales, the model did not show satisfying results when applied to porous pavements, especially about heavy metal and total nitrogen modelling. The predictive power of the model has been assessed through the calculation of the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient, widely adopted in the Anglo-Saxon world to evaluate behaviour and performance of the hydrologic models. Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient is an indicator of the model’s ability to predict about the 1 : 1 line between observed and simulated data. NSE ranges between −∞ and 1. 0 (1 inclusive), with NSE = 1 being the optimal value. Values between 0. 0 and 1. 0 are generally viewed as acceptable levels of performance, whereas values < 0. 0 indicates that the mean observed value is a better predictor than the simulated value, which indicates unacceptable performance. Considering this, the concentration data collected has been processed, also taking into account of the correlation analysis previously carried out, which allowed to estimate the concentrations of the main pollutants such as TSS (Total Suspended Solids), TP (Total Phosphorous) and TN (Total Nitrogen) to the output section of the porous pavements. The reliability of the new proposed formulas has been demonstrated both by high values of the Nash- Sutcliffe coefficients, always positive, and also by very low errors (between 10 % and 25 %) among modelled and measured concentrationsDottorato di Ricerca in Ingegneria Idraulica per l'ambiente ed il Territorio Ciclo XXVI a. a. 2012 - 2013 Università degli Studi della Calabri...|$|E

These models are used to describe the migration and the transport of pollutants and to predict the contaminant evolution. the models and their parameters selection depend on the extension and the quality of the diagnosis data. the modeller has to know the limits of application of the modelling approach to improve the quality of the assessment. the research program TRANSPOL was undertaken in order to bring a better and a common practice of the use of transport models for various groups of <b>pollutants</b> with similar <b>behaviour</b> (PAH, metals, chlorine solvents. PAHs have a specific behaviour due to their strong affinity for the organic matter, their low solubility, and their density. These compounds are often associated with other contaminants and they are the major pollutants of disused coke plants, wood preservative treatment plants and ancient gas production plants. PAHs can also be found in the environment after major incidents or spills (fuels may indeed contain significant PAHs concentration). the particular behaviour of those compounds and their present and past uses justify to study the transport of the soluble and non-soluble phases. Naphthalene was especially studied with two complementary approaches. Naphthalene is used commonly as a tracer of pollution for the PAHs contamination due to its high solubility and its low capacity of adsorption, which increase its mobility...|$|R
40|$|Four {{sperm whales}} (three subadult males {{stranded}} on the Belgian coast, a fourth older male found dead at sea) were analysed for total mercury, methylmercury and organochlorines. All four {{were part of}} a total of 24 sperm whales that stranded on the North Sea coasts over a period of six months, a highly unusual phenomenon. Total mercury levels ranged from 0. 5 µg/g fw in kidney and 1 in muscle, up to 15 in liver. The finding of at least 90 % of the mercury in its inorganic form confirms the existence of detoxification mechanisms in the liver of cetaceans. PCB concentrations in muscle, liver, kidney and blubber ranged from 10 to 25 µg/g lipids. These results are in the same order of magnitude as literature data, which however does not imply that there is no impact on the populations. Social affiliation with a particular adult bull rather than a direct effect of pollutants may have been the primary cause of the stranding of the three younger animals: they apparently remained close to the older one (the leader?) dead at sea, and stranded in very shallow water. Indirect impact of anthropogenic <b>pollutants</b> influencing the <b>behaviour</b> and/or the health of a social cluster is one plausible hypothesis to explain why a large number of sperm whales got trapped in the North Sea, but limited data available on the large bull fail to support this...|$|R

While the effect of increased sedimentation on the settlement of coral species is well studied, {{little is known about}} the impact on larval fish. Here, the effect of a laterite “red soil” sediment <b>pollutant</b> on settlement <b>behaviour</b> and post-settlement performance of reef fish was tested. In aquarium tests that isolated sensory cues, we found significant olfaction-based avoidance behaviour and disruption of visual cue use in settlement-stage larval fish at 50 mg L− 1, a concentration regularly exceeded in situ during rain events. In situ light trap catches showed lower abundance and species richness in the presence of red soil, but were not significantly different due to high variance in the data. Prolonged exposure to red soil produced altered olfactory cue responses, whereby fish in red soil made a likely maladaptive choice for dead coral compared to controls where fish chose live coral. Other significant effects of prolonged exposure included decreased feeding rates and body condition. These effects on fish larvae reared over 5 days occurred in the presence of a minor drop in pH and may be due to the chemical influence of the sediment. Our results show that sediment pollution of coral reefs may have more complex effects on the ability of larval fish to successfully locate suitable habitat than previously thought, as well as impacting on their post-settlement performance and, ultimately, recruitment success...|$|R

However, honeybees are also exposed to {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POPs). The aim of this laboratory based {{study was to determine}} if exposure to sublethal field-relevant concentrations of POPs altered the spontaneous behaviour of foraging-age worker honeybees. Honeybees (Apis mellifera) were orally exposed to either a sublethal concentration of the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture Aroclor 1254 (100 [*]ng/ml), the organochlorine insecticide lindane (2. 91 [*]ng/ml) or vehicle (0. 01 % DMSO, 0. 00015 % ethanol in 1 M sucrose) for 1 – 4 days. The frequency of single event behaviours and the time engaged in one of four behavioural states (walking, flying, upside down and stationary) were monitored for 15 [*]min after 1, 2, 3 and 4 days exposure. Exposure to Aroclor 1254 but not lindane increased the frequency and time engaged in honeybee motor activity behaviours in comparison to vehicle. The Aroclor 1254 —induced hyperactivity was evident after 1 day of exposure and persisted with repeated daily exposure. In contrast, 1 day of exposure to lindane elicited abdominal spasms and increased the frequency of grooming behaviours in comparison to vehicle exposure. After 4 days of exposure, abdominal spasms and increased grooming behaviours were also evident in honeybees exposed to Aroclor 1254. These data demonstrate that POPs can induce distinct behavioural patterns, indicating different toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic properties. The changes in spontaneous behaviour, particularly the PCB-induced chronic hyperactivity and the associated energy demands, may have implications for colony health...|$|R
40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons {{and many of}} their derivatives are considered to be ubiquitous environmental pollutants, which often exhibit mutagenic and/or carcinogenic activity. In the atmosphere, photolysis is generally considered to be the dominant degradation pathway for these <b>pollutants.</b> The photochemical <b>behaviours</b> of benzo(a) pyrene, benzo(b) fluoranthene and benzo(k) fluoranthene have been examined in the laboratory. This study was complemented by an analysis of ambient air samples collected in the vicinity of a Horizontal Stud Soderberg aluminum smelter in Beauharnois, Quebec. Benzo(a) pyrene is much more reactive in the presence of light when compared to the fluoranthene compounds. The products were identified as the 1, 6 -, 3, 6 - and 6, 12 -benzo(a) pyrenediones. An analysis of the ambient air samples revealed the prevalence of benzo(b) fluoranthene in the emissions from the aluminum smelter. Its relatively high abundance and resistance to degradation indicates {{that it will be a}} suitable indicator to represent total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon levels at the smelter. The photochemical behaviour of a series of nitropolycyclic {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} has also been investigated. The photoreactivity of these compounds in solution and adsorbed onto a surface has previously been associated with the torsion angle of the nitro group with respect to the aromatic moiety. Initially, through a combination of spectroscopic techniques and semi-empirical calculations, the orientation of the nitro group in each compound was determined. Solution studies were inconclusive in determining the role of the torsion angle of the nitro group in influencing the photochemical degradation. However, when the compounds were adsorbed onto a surface, no relationship could be established between photoreactivity and the orientation. The stability of these compounds was also examined during the sampling process. In an effort to further examine the relationship between t...|$|R
