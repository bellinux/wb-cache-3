40|$|Farmers {{who were}} {{lucky enough to}} plant {{soybeans}} and <b>spray</b> <b>pre-emergence</b> herbicides in between rain events may now be seeing discolored or injured seedlings. Reports of fields with these issues are widespread across Indiana, Iowa, and surrounding areas, and many farmers and crop advisors are questioning if damage is more severe when pre-emergence herbicides are applied to fields that have been planted with seed treated with the new fluopyram fungicide seed treatment ILeVO...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of pre-emergence herbicide, post-emergence herbicide and hand weeding alone {{as well as}} in combination with farm yard manure (FYM) were studied in potato for three years. The emergence percentage was at the top (84. 6) where <b>pre-emergence</b> herbicide was <b>sprayed</b> and FYM was not added followed by (84. 3) hand weeding in which FYM was used. The uncontrolled weed plots gave an average of 535. 8 g m‾ 2 more fresh weeds weight than weeds controlled plots. The hand weeding plots gave an average of 58. 9 g m‾ 2 more fresh weeds weight than chemically weed controlled plots. The pre-emergence herbicide controlled plots yielded an average of 111. 1 g m‾ 2 more fresh weeds weight as compared to post-emergence herbicide controlled plots. The percentage of > 55 mm tubers was at the top (55. 1) where post-emergence herbicide was sprayed and FYM was added followed by (50. 2 %) pre-emergence herbicide treated plots in which FYM was not added. The seed size (35 - 55 mm) tuber percentage was at the top (41. 1) where weeds were not eradicated and FYM was not added followed by (40. 8 %) hand weeding plots in which FYM was added. The percentage of & 35 mm tubers was at the bottom (11. 2) where <b>pre-emergence</b> herbicide was <b>sprayed</b> and FYM was added. Weeds control by any methods increased potato yield an average of 7. 983 t ha‾ 1 (27. 52 %) than the uncontrolled weeds plots. The FYM increased an average of 3. 687 t ha‾ 1 (10. 49 %) yield in potato as compared to plots in which FYM was not applied. The chemically weed controlled methods produced an average of 4. 482 t ha‾ 1 (13. 18 %) more potatoes than hand weeding. The post-emergence herbicide, on an average basis yielded more potatoes than pre-emergence herbicide. The difference was 3. 355 t ha‾ 1 (9. 11 %) in the favour of post-emergence herbicide. On the basis of three years results post-emergence herbicide is recommended for effective weeds control and higher production...|$|R
40|$|Different cruciferous weeds were {{drilled in}} autumn 2011 and 2012 {{in a field}} near Münster. Beside common species like hedge mustard (Sisymbrium officinale Scop.), shepherd`s purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris), pennycress (Thlaspiarvense), tall hedge mustard (Sisymbrium loeselii) and {{flixweed}} (Descurainia sophia), we tried to establish weeds that are not common on arable land in Germany until now. These were: Yellow rocket (Barbarea vulgaris), hoary cress (Lepidium draba) and Turkish rocket (Bunias orientalis). In autumn 2011 emergence of the sown weeds was poor. In {{the second year of}} experiment we got good emergence of the named weeds excluding hoary cress (Lepidium draba). In autumn 2011 and 2012 different herbicidecombinations were applied across the stripes. The best results were achieved with Colzor Trio (clomazone + dimethachlor + napropamid) which was applied in <b>pre-emergence</b> state, a <b>spray</b> sequence Butisan Gold (metazachlor + quinmerac + dimethenamid-P) applied in pre-emergence followed by Salsa (ethametsulfuronmethyl) + Trend (adjuvant) in post-emergence and Clearfield-Vantiga (metazachlor + quinmerac + imazamox) + Dash (adjuvant), also applied in post-emergence state of the weeds...|$|R
