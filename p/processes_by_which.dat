5|$|The {{absence of}} wheels in nature is {{frequently}} attributed to constraints imposed by biology: natural selection constrains the evolutionary paths available to species, and the <b>processes</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> multicellular organisms grow and develop may {{not permit the}} construction of a functioning wheel.|$|E
5|$|Geology is {{the science}} and study of the solid and liquid matter that {{constitutes}} the Earth. The field of geology encompasses {{the study of the}} composition, structure, physical properties, dynamics, and history of Earth materials, and the <b>processes</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major academic discipline, and is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards, some Geotechnical engineering fields, and understanding past climates and environments.|$|E
5|$|This teleonomy is {{the quality}} whereby the process of natural {{selection}} creates and preserves traits that are seemingly fitted for the functional roles they perform. The <b>processes</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> the changes occur, {{from one generation to}} another, are called evolutionary processes or mechanisms. The four most widely recognised evolutionary processes are natural selection (including sexual selection), genetic drift, mutation and gene migration due to genetic admixture. Natural selection and genetic drift sort variation; mutation and gene migration create variation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>process</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> a supramolecular {{assembly}} forms is called molecular self-assembly. Some try to distinguish self-assembly as the <b>process</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> individual molecules form the defined aggregate. Self-organization, then, is the <b>process</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> those aggregates create higher-order structures. This can become useful {{when talking about}} liquid crystals and block copolymers.|$|R
50|$|While lipolysis is {{triglyceride}} hydrolysis (the <b>process</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> triglycerides {{are broken}} down), esterification is the <b>process</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> triglycerides are formed. Esterification and lipolysis are, in essence, reversals of one another.|$|R
50|$|In {{the field}} of {{developmental}} biology, regional differentiation is the <b>process</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> different areas are identified {{in the development of}} the early embryo. The <b>process</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> the cells become specified differs between organisms.|$|R
5|$|Environmental {{sociology}} is {{the study}} of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the <b>processes</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> environmental problems become defined and known to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the sociology of risk, rural sociology and the sociology of disaster.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} history {{of life on}} Earth traces the <b>processes</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> living and fossil organisms evolved since life appeared on the planet, until the present. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years (Ga) ago and {{there is evidence that}} life appeared as early as 4.1 Ga. The similarities among all present-day organisms indicate the presence of a common ancestor from which all known species have diverged through the process of evolution. More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct. Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.9 million are estimated to have been named and 1.6 million documented in a central database to date. More recently, in May 2016, scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described.|$|E

5000|$|Girard's explicates three core {{mechanisms}} that govern widespread social interactions: mimesis, the <b>process</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> individuals copy {{one another in}} escalation, leading to conflict; scapegoating, a <b>process</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> collective guilt is transferred onto victims, then purged; and violence.|$|R
50|$|Reannealing or {{correctly}} annealing, is the <b>process</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> two single {{strands of}} DNA combine to form double-stranded DNA.

25|$|Criteria and {{indicators}} are tools {{which can be}} used to conceptualise, evaluate and implement sustainable forest management. Criteria define and characterize the essential elements, as well as a set of conditions or <b>processes,</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> sustainable forest management may be assessed. Periodically measured indicators reveal the direction of change with respect to each criterion.|$|E
25|$|In winemaking, {{clarification}} and stabilization are the <b>processes</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> {{insoluble matter}} {{suspended in the}} wine is removed before bottling. This matter may include dead yeast cells (lees), bacteria, tartrates, proteins, pectins, various tannins and other phenolic compounds, as well as pieces of grape skin, pulp, stems and gums. Clarification and stabilization may involve , filtration, centrifugation, flotation, refrigeration, pasteurization, and/or barrel maturation and racking.|$|E
25|$|Because a large {{proportion}} of stars exist in binary systems, binaries are particularly important {{to our understanding of the}} <b>processes</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> stars form. In particular, the period and masses of the binary tell us about the amount of angular momentum in the system. Because this is a conserved quantity in physics, binaries give us important clues about the conditions under which the stars were formed.|$|E

25|$|While this {{perspective}} {{suggests that the}} technology drives and therefore is a determining factor {{in the process of}} globalization, arguments involving technological determinism are generally frowned upon by mainstream media studies. Instead academics focus on the multiplicity of <b>processes</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> technology is funded, researched and produced, forming a feedback loop when the technologies are used and often transformed by their users, which then feeds into the process of guiding their future development.|$|E

Dollond's paper recounts the successive steps by which he arrived at his discovery independently of Hall's earlier inventionâ€”and the logical <b>processes</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> these steps were suggested to his mind.|$|E
25|$|Soon after this, Congress {{passed the}} {{landmark}} Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975; this completed a 15-year period of federal policy reform {{with regard to}} American Indian tribes. The legislation authorized <b>processes</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> tribes could negotiate contracts with the BIA to manage directly more of their education and social service programs. In addition, it provided direct grants to help tribes develop plans for assuming such responsibility. It also provided for Indian parents' participation on local school boards.|$|E
25|$|Tlingit grammar {{at first}} glance appears to be highly fusional, {{but this is an}} {{incorrect}} assumption. There are predictable <b>processes</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> the basic phonetic shapes of individual morphemes are modified to fit various phonological requirements. These processes can be described with a regular language, and such descriptions are given here on a per morpheme basis by giving rule schemas for the context sensitive phonological modification of base morphemes. Analyzing all the possible combinations of morphemes and phonological contexts in Tlingit and constructing a regular language to describe them is a daunting but tractable task.|$|E
