Shorter pump wavelengths have also been associated with increased non-radiative energy decay and reduced laser efficiency. We report studies of fluorescence emission spectra of Alexandrite illuminated at a range of wavelengths from green to red, which demonstrate reduced fluorescence yield for shorter pump wavelengths at elevated crystal temperatures. Investigations of pulsed laser pumping of Alexandrite over the same spectral range demonstrated reduced pump threshold energy for longer pump wavelengths. High repetition rate pulsed pumping of Alexandrite at 532, 578 and 671 nm showed stable and efficient laser performance was only achieved for red pumping at 671 nm.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 211 In {{order to}} ensure safe, reliable, {{efficient}} and cost effective operation of reciprocating pumps, pump dynamics should not be ignored. Pump problems due to dynamics are often difficult to diagnose and solve. Dynamic problems usually lie {{in one or more}} of the following areas: *Pulsation control (piping acoustics) *Vibration control (piping mechanics) *Cavitation control (pulsation and pressure drop) *Pump valve dynamics (valve motion). All the areas can be interactive to such an extent that it is difficult to know where the most effective changes can be made. A clear summary of each area will be presented with a view towards understanding how these areas can interact. The topic will be approached from an engineering perception viewpoint (a spectral energy response overlay) with minimal emphasis on mathematical concepts. Following the energy as it transfers though the whole system reveals how inefficient energy transfer and local energy magnification (resonance) is key to understanding how to prevent or solve everyday problems. Problems such as vibration, bladder failure, valve failure, poor performance, fatigue failure, and safety concerns are usually linked to one or more dynamic areas. Along with a basic understanding of the physics involved in pump dynamic areas, it is also helpful to have a working knowledge of ?rule of thumb? techniques that can be reliable and extremely cost effective. Pulsation control will be viewed using mechanical analogies with cause and effect scenarios. Vibration control will be focused on reducing the shaking force through reducing acoustic-to-mechanical coupling mechanisms, instead of brute force mechanical modifications. Cavitation and NPSHR (the inlet pressure required to prevent cavitation) problems will be viewed from a simple understanding of local instantaneous pressure compared to vapor pressure. Valve dynamics will be viewed in terms of simple fluid pressure forces, as they are exerted on a pressure controlled valve element. This engineering perception has a firm theoretical foundation but requires only fundamental mathematics to employ. Two short case histories will be presented illustrating pulsation/vibration control, cavitation control and pump valve problems. In almost all cases, piping vibration is the result of pulsation coupling into mechanical shaking forces yielding vibration with possible fatigue failures. Pump manifolds and external piping can be modified to ensure nonresonant acoustic systems that greatly reduce vibrational force. Once the shaking force is reduced, it remains to ensure that mechanical resonance is not present. Although cavitation is generally thought to be pressure drop related, in many cases it can be traced to acoustical resonances associated with the <b>pump</b> <b>manifold</b> and connected piping. Pump valve problems are generally solved through increasing spring stiffness, decreasing lift and employing more rugged materials. The use of newly developed materials has had the tendency of appearing as a universal fix where high pulsation levels can be tolerated. The best solution for many valve problems is reducing the pulsations that induce excessive impact forces. The use of a spectral energy response overlay or window is a concept that is in use by many who deal with dynamic problems. This type of approach is easily understood, but not as rigorous as the actual model approach. It should become apparent that most design quality can be determined by the overlay approach. It is not intended to replace the full model, but it will produce a good initial starting design and form the basis for analyzing existing field problems...|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2015. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: James Van de Ven. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xxii, 255 pages. Hydraulic power systems offer a robust, compact, and flexible method of power transmission {{and are used}} widely in both industrial and mobile applications. While 2 % of the energy consumed in the US passes through hydraulic systems, {{less than half of}} it does any useful work largely due to the use of inefficient flow control valves. Variable displacement pumps offer a method of delivering the required flow to an actuator without suffering the losses associated with a flow control valve. However, current variable displacement pumps exhibit poor efficiency at low displacement because their primary sources of energy loss are largely independent of displacement. Here, a novel adjustable linkage is proposed as the driving mechanism of a variable displacement pump. The linkage is constructed such that the pumping piston returns to the same top-dead-center position at all displacement, and can also achieve zero displacement. As a result of these features, the pump displacement is infinitely variable, and the unswept volume is remains constant at all displacements. By using pinned joints rather than sliding joints, the majority of the energy losses scale with output power resulting in a pump that is efficient over a wide range of operating conditions. In this thesis, a complete model of a variable displacement linkage pump is developed. A method of constructing the adjustable sixbar mechanism and the possible embodiments is presented. A new solution rectification technique is developed providing a robust method of generating valid linkages that is generally applicable to other mechanisms. The kinematics of the mechanism are then presented to describe the motion of the links and output piston. A kinetostatic model of the mechanism provides a means of determining the internal mechanical energy losses. A non-linear model of the bearing friction augments the model, but requires numerical methods to solve, and increases computational complexity. A dynamic model of the pumping cylinders and <b>pump</b> <b>manifold</b> provide a means of determining the fluid behavior of the pump including output flowrates and pressures. These models are coupled to create a complete understanding of the variable displacement linkage pump. The model is designed to be predictive and computationally inexpensive for use in multi-objective optimizations. As such, no experimentally determined performance coefficients are required. No model of this level of completeness exist for linkage driven pumps, variable displacement or otherwise. Two prototype pumps are presented and used to validate the models. A single cylinder pump is used to validate the mechanical energy loss model but was limited to low pressure operation due to large torque variations. Close agreement is demonstrated between the model and experiment. The model predicts a pump efficiency greater than 90 % at displacements as low as 15 % if roller bearings are used in the pin joints. To validate this prediction, a multi-cylinder prototype which uses roller bearings in the joints is designed. The kinematic and mechanical energy loss models are coupled to a basic pumping model for use in a multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimize the mechanism. The resulting pump demonstrates close agreement between the model and experimentally measured shaft torque and mechanical energy loss at various pressures, displacements, and input shaft speeds. However, out-of-plane deflection of the mechanism reduced the piston displacement and altered the trajectory reducing pump output. The true temporal piston position is measured and used as an input to the dynamic fluid model. The predicted and experimentally measured cylinder pressures demonstrate the effectiveness of the model at predicting the dynamic behavior of the fluid end of the pump. It is shown that the models can accurately capture the physics of the pump without using tuning parameters or experimentally determined coefficients over a wide range of operating conditions. It is recommended that single shear linkage arrangements are avoided in future designs to increase the mechanism stiffness and improve performance. The variable displacement linkage pump offers the opportunity for high efficiency flow control at a wide range of operating conditions {{due to the nature of}} the energy loss mechanisms scaling with the output power. The flexibility of the driving sixbar mechanism allows for the optimization of the architecture for particular applications and the presented model provides a means of predicting performance...|$|E

Our aim {{is to determine the}} strength of ESA channels at wavelengths addressable by commercially available laser diodes around 630 - 680 nm, pivotal for building waveguide upconversion lasers. The favorable lifetime of the 3 F 4 energy-level and negligible ground-state absorption for the red-wavelength second-step excitation, ensures a direct and efficient excitation route for a dual-wavelength pumping scheme of the thulium ion, which will enable blue-green laser emission from its 1 G 4 manifold. ESA measurements in the red spectral region were conducted at room temperature utilizing the pump-probe technique. The advantage of the LED probe over a broadband incandescent lamp is that stimulated-emission at the probe wavelength can be eliminated, simplifying the analysis of the measurement and the determination of the magnitude of the ESA cross-section. Four Tm-doped crystalline hosts Y 3 Al 5 O 12 (YAG), YAlO 3 (YAP), LiYF 4 (YLF), and KYGdLu(WO 4) 2 (KYGdLuW) were investigated, with polarized ESA spectra measured for the non-isotropic samples.

The main {{high pressure}} oil (HPO) system components are; High Pressure Oil <b>Pump</b> (HPOP), HPO <b>manifolds,</b> Stand pipes and branch tube. The HPOP {{is located in the}} engine valley {{at the rear of the}} engine block. Early build years (2003.5-04.5) are well known for pre-mature HPOP failure. This is due to the poor quality materials used in manufacturing. The HPOP is pressurized by a rotating gear, meshed with a rear camshaft gear. The early model HPOP gears were known to be weak, and develop stress cracks in the teeth resulting in gear failure, thus causing a no start issue for the engine. Early models also had the ICP sensor located on the HPOP cover. The high amount of heat in this location, combined with the exposure to debris in the oil was known to cause ICP sensor failure also resulting in a no start condition. This issue was addressed by Ford with the late 2004 engine update, bringing a new HPOP design, along with relocation of the ICP sensor to the Passenger side valve cover. The newly designed pump is not known for frequent failure, however a new issue arose with the update. In the late model engines, Ford also redesigned the HPO stand pipes and dummy plugs in the HPO manifold, using poor quality o-rings. These o-rings were prone to failure causing a HPO leak, and eventually a no start condition. Ford addressed this concern with updated Viton o-ring washers fixing the issue. With the new HPO system design also came a Snap To Connet (STC) fitting. Some models had issue with the prongs of the STC fitting breaking causing the fitting to lose it's sealing property and again, a no start condition for the engine. Another frequent (but not always catastrophic) issue with the HPO system is the Injection Pressure Regulator (IPR) screen. The IPR screen is located in the engine valley with the oil cooler. The material used was susceptible to failure and neglecting to replace the screen during an oil cooler replacement could lead to the debris being sent through the HPOP causing complete failure.|$|R
