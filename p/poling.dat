5|$|The Republican nominee, <b>Poling,</b> was a Baptist preacher with a {{national}} reputation for integrity whom GOP leaders hoped would help deflect the corruption charges leveled against the machine. <b>Poling</b> had worked for various charitable organizations and managed the Christian Herald. His son, Clark V. <b>Poling,</b> {{was one of the}} Four Chaplains lost aboard the SS Dorchester in World War II, and <b>Poling</b> served as pastor at the chapel erected in their memory. <b>Poling</b> was challenged in the primary by Walter P. Miller, a businessman who had the backing of independent Republicans. The ward leaders swung their support to <b>Poling,</b> who won by a six-to-one margin.|$|E
5|$|<b>Poling</b> took severe {{punishment}} {{from very}} accurate bombing. Since Ventnor radar station had been knocked out already, this attack demonstrated that {{an attack on}} Fighter Command's command, communication and control system was possible. Emergency equipment had been installed on the site {{in case of a}} breakdown, but the information and reading of the radar was significantly less reliable. In fact, <b>Poling</b> was so badly damaged it was out of action for the rest of August. Fortunately, the CH chain had a mobile radar station at the Isle of Wight to fill in for it. Another was due to be set up near <b>Poling</b> anyway, so the chain remained unaffected. The damage done to Kenley and <b>Poling</b> were no more than inconveniences to Park and Dowding. Only one WAAF member, Avis Parsons, was studying the plots at <b>Poling</b> up until the attack. She was awarded the Military Medal for her actions on 5 September 1940.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of the}} {{long-range}} radar station at <b>Poling</b> caused few problems. The Chain Home Low radar there was working and could see almost as far out to sea. Along the surrounding coastline, for 70 miles, another six radar stations gave interlocking stations which provided cover, {{so there was no}} hole in the system. Within a few days, mobile units were moved into wooded areas nearby to provide cover until <b>Poling</b> was repaired.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{not yet fully}} understood event in DNA replication is the DNA polymerase (<b>pol)</b> switch from <b>pol</b> alpha to <b>pol</b> delta. Indirect evidence suggested that the clamp loader replication factor C (RF-C) plays an important role, since a replication competent protein complex containing <b>pol</b> alpha, <b>pol</b> delta and RF-C could perform <b>pol</b> switching {{in the presence of}} proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). By using purified <b>pol</b> alpha/primase, <b>pol</b> delta, RF-C, PCNA and RP-A we show that: (i) RF-C can inhibit <b>pol</b> alpha in the presence of ATP prior to PCNA loading, (ii) RF-C decreases the affinity of <b>pol</b> alpha for the 3 'OH primer ends, (iii) the inhibition of <b>pol</b> alpha by RF-C is released upon PCNA loading, (iv) ATP hydrolysis is required for PCNA loading and subsequent release of inhibition of <b>pol</b> alpha, (v) under these conditions a switching from <b>pol</b> alpha/primase to <b>pol</b> delta is evident. Thus, RF-C appears to be critical for the <b>pol</b> alpha to <b>pol</b> delta switching. Based on these results, a model is proposed in which RF-C induces the <b>pol</b> switching by sequestering the 3 '-OH end from <b>pol</b> alpha and subsequently recruiting PCNA to DNA...|$|R
40|$|Translesion DNA {{synthesis}} (TLS) by specialized DNA polymerases (<b>Pols)</b> is a conserved {{mechanism for}} tolerating replication blocking DNA lesions. The actions of TLS <b>Pols</b> are managed {{in part by}} ring-shaped sliding clamp proteins. In addition to catalyzing TLS, altered expression of TLS <b>Pols</b> impedes cellular growth. The goal {{of this study was}} to define the relationship between the physiological function of Escherichia coli <b>Pol</b> IV in TLS and its ability to impede growth when overproduced. To this end, 13 novel <b>Pol</b> IV mutants were identified that failed to impede growth. Subsequent analysis of these mutants suggest that overproduced levels of <b>Pol</b> IV inhibit E. coli growth by gaining inappropriate access to the replication fork via a <b>Pol</b> III-Pol IV switch that is mechanistically similar to that used under physiological conditions to coordinate <b>Pol</b> IV-catalyzed TLS with <b>Pol</b> III-catalyzed replication. Detailed analysis of one mutant, <b>Pol</b> IV-T 120 P, and two previously described <b>Pol</b> IV mutants impaired for interaction with either the rim (<b>Pol</b> IVR) or the cleft (<b>Pol</b> IVC) of the β sliding clamp revealed novel insights into the mechanism of the <b>Pol</b> III-Pol IV switch. Specifically, <b>Pol</b> IV-T 120 P retained complete catalytic activity in vitro but, like <b>Pol</b> IVR and <b>Pol</b> IVC, failed to support <b>Pol</b> IV TLS function in vivo. Notably, the T 120 P mutation abrogated a biochemical interaction of <b>Pol</b> IV with <b>Pol</b> III that was required for <b>Pol</b> III-Pol IV switching. Taken together, these results support a model in which <b>Pol</b> III-Pol IV switching involves interaction of <b>Pol</b> IV with <b>Pol</b> III, as well as the β clamp rim and cleft. Moreover, they provide strong support for the view that <b>Pol</b> III-Pol IV switching represents a vitally important mechanism for regulating TLS in vivo by managing access of <b>Pol</b> IV to the DNA...|$|R
40|$|A {{new form}} of DNA {{polymerase}} III, termed <b>Pol</b> III star (<b>Pol</b> III*), has been purified to homogeneity from Escherichia coli. <b>Pol</b> III* is temperature sensitive when isolated from a thermo-sensitive dnaE mutant, as had been described for <b>Pol</b> III. <b>Pol</b> III* and <b>Pol</b> III are separable by gel filtration. <b>Pol</b> III* utilizes a duplex template containing short gaps with the same catalytic properties as <b>Pol</b> III. However, <b>Pol</b> III* is able to replicate long, singlestranded templates such as homopolymer chains and viral circles of M 13 and ϕX 174 if provided with the following: spermidine, a primer fragment, and a new protein, termed copolymerase III* (Copol III*). The latter, purified to homogeneity, has no known independent enzymatic activity and supports synthesis by <b>Pol</b> III* but not by <b>Pol</b> I, <b>Pol</b> II, or <b>Pol</b> III...|$|R
5|$|Hugo Sperrle's Luftflotte 3 {{ordered his}} dive bomber units to begin {{operations}} against the radar stations and airfields {{on the southern}} coast of Britain. The targets {{on the afternoon of}} 18 August were RAF Ford, RAF Thorney Island and Gosport, all belonging to the Fleet Air Arm or Coastal Command. Included in the target selection was the radar station at <b>Poling,</b> West Sussex, near Littlehampton.|$|E
5|$|As Bode was {{in action}} at <b>Poling,</b> Alfons Orthofer's unit {{attacked}} Ford. There were only six Lewis machine guns manned at Ford and the Ju 87s {{were able to}} attack with complete confidence. Bombs rained down on huts, hangars, building and amongst aircraft drawn up together for maintenance. Early on bombs struck the field's oil tanks and storage compounds causing an enormous blaze which contributed to the crippling damage on the airfield. Gosport also came under attack soon after. Siegel's Ju 87s, with no air opposition, swooped onto their targets causing large-scale damage.|$|E
5|$|Samuel {{did not run}} for {{re-election}} as mayor, leaving an open seat to be contested by the Republican nominee, Daniel A. <b>Poling,</b> and the Democrat, Joseph S.

After several unsuccessful attempts at public office in Philadelphia, {{he served as a}} Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania. Clark was known as a reformer, having been elected city controller two years earlier in 1949 on a platform of cleaning up corruption in the city. Despite being slandered as a communist for his membership in the Americans for Democratic Action, a left-wing group, Clark was victorious.|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to RNA polymerases I, II, and III, the essential RNA polymerases {{present in all}} eukaryotes, plants have two additional nuclear RNA polymerases, abbreviated as <b>Pol</b> IV and <b>Pol</b> V, that play nonredundant roles in siRNA-directed DNA methylation and gene silencing. We show that Arabidopsis <b>Pol</b> IV and <b>Pol</b> V are composed of subunits that are paralogous or identical to the 12 subunits of <b>Pol</b> II. Four subunits of <b>Pol</b> IV are distinct from their <b>Pol</b> II paralogs, six subunits of <b>Pol</b> V are distinct from their <b>Pol</b> II paralogs, and four subunits differ between <b>Pol</b> IV and <b>Pol</b> V. Importantly, the subunit differences occur in key positions relative to the template entry and RNA exit paths. Our findings {{support the hypothesis that}} <b>Pol</b> IV and <b>Pol</b> V are <b>Pol</b> II-like enzymes that evolved specialized roles in the production of noncoding transcripts for RNA silencing and genome defense...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{purification}} and depletion {{studies were}} used to determine the major stable forms of RNA polymerase II (<b>Pol</b> II) complexes found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear extracts. About 50 % of <b>Pol</b> II is found associated with the general transcription factor TFIIF (<b>Pol</b> II-TFIIF), and about 20 % of <b>Pol</b> II is associated with Mediator (Pol-Med). No <b>Pol</b> II-Med-TFIIF complex was observed. The activity of <b>Pol</b> II and the purified <b>Pol</b> II complexes in transcription initiation and reinitiation was investigated by supplementing extracts depleted of either total <b>Pol</b> II or total TFIIF with purified <b>Pol</b> II or the <b>Pol</b> II complexes. We found that all three forms of <b>Pol</b> II can complement <b>Pol</b> II-depleted extracts for transcription initiation, but <b>Pol</b> II-TFIIF has the highest specific activity. Similarly, <b>Pol</b> II-TFIIF has a much higher specific activity than TFIIF for complementation of TFIIF transcription activity. Although the <b>Pol</b> II-TFIIF and <b>Pol</b> II-Med complexes were stable when purified, we found these complexes were dynamic in extracts under transcription conditions, with a single polymerase capable of exchanging bound Mediator and TFIIF. Using a purified system to examine transcription reinitiation, we found that <b>Pol</b> II-TFIIF was active in promoting multiple rounds of transcription while <b>Pol</b> II-Med was nearly inactive. These results suggest that both the <b>Pol</b> II-Med and <b>Pol</b> II-TFIIF complexes can be recruited for transcription initiation but that only the <b>Pol</b> II-TFIIF complex is competent for transcription reinitiation...|$|R

5|$|Ski orienteering {{is a form}} of {{cross-country}} skiing competition that requires navigation in a landscape, making optimal route choices at racing speeds. Standard orienteering maps are used, but with special green overprinting of trails and tracks to indicate their navigability in snow; other symbols indicate whether any roads are snow-covered or clear. Standard skate-skiing equipment is used, along with a map holder attached to the chest. It is one of the four orienteering disciplines recognized by the International Orienteering Federation. Upper body strength is especially important because of frequent double <b>poling</b> along narrow snow trails.|$|E
5|$|At 13:29 {{the first}} Ju 87s took off. By 13:45 all were in {{formation}} and beginning the 85-mile trip. Major Helmut Bode led III./StG 77 to <b>Poling.</b> He {{knew nothing of}} the technicalities of his target. Behind him was Hauptmann Alfons Orthofer's II./StG 77 bound for Ford. After them, Hauptmann Herbert Meisel's III Gruppe was heading on {{the left of the}} formation for Thorney Island. Hauptmann Walter Seigel's I./StG 3 headed for Gosport on the extreme left. Each Ju 87 was loaded with 550-lb bombs under the main fuselage and four 11-lb bombs and two under each wing. The Bf 109s would not take off for some time. The long trip and low speed of the Ju 87s meant there was plenty of time to catch up without burning fuel keeping close contact with the Stukas.|$|E
5|$|I./StG 77 were {{to strike}} at Thorney Island with 28 Ju 87s; 28 II./StG 77 were {{assigned}} to Ford; and 31 III./StG 77 Ju 87s were to destroy <b>Poling</b> radar station. A fourth unit, Sturzkampfgeschwader 3 (StG 3 or Dive Bombing Wing 3), sent 22 Ju 87s to attack Gosport. The dive-bombers were supported by 157 Bf 109s; 70 from JG 27; 32 from JG 53 acting as close escort; and 55 from JG 2 which was to sweep the Portsmouth area {{in advance of the}} main raid independently. The Ju 87s were based around Caen, too far away for the attacks. So in the morning the Stukas were moved into closer airfields around Cherbourg, right on the Channel coast. There, fuel tanks were filled, bombs loaded, and crews given a final briefing.|$|E
40|$|Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) {{has been}} shown to {{interact}} with a variety of DNA polymerases (<b>pol)</b> such as <b>pol</b> delta, <b>pol</b> epsilon, <b>pol</b> iota, <b>pol</b> kappa, <b>pol</b> eta, and <b>pol</b> beta. Here we show that PCNA directly interacts with the newly discovered <b>pol</b> lambda cloned from human cells. This interaction stabilizes the binding of <b>pol</b> lambda to the primer template, thus increasing its affinity for the hydroxyl primer and its processivity in DNA synthesis. However, no effect of PCNA was detected on the rate of nucleotide incorporation or discrimination efficiency by <b>pol</b> lambda. PCNA was found to stimulate efficient synthesis by <b>pol</b> lambda across an abasic (AP) site. When compared with <b>pol</b> delta, human <b>pol</b> lambda showed the ability to incorporate a nucleotide in front of the lesion. Addition of PCNA led to efficient elongation past the AP site by <b>pol</b> lambda but not by <b>pol</b> delta. However, when tested on a template containing a bulky DNA lesion, such as the major cisplatin Pt-d(GpG) adduct, PCNA could not allow translesion synthesis by <b>pol</b> lambda. Our results suggest that the complex between PCNA and <b>pol</b> lambda may {{play an important role in}} the bypass of abasic sites in human cells...|$|R

40|$|The bypass of DNA lesions by the {{replication}} fork requires a switch between the replicative DNA polymerase (<b>Pol)</b> {{and a more}} specialized translesion synthesis (TLS) <b>Pol</b> to overcome the obstacle. DNA <b>Pol</b> δ-interacting protein 2 (PolDIP 2) {{has been found to}} physically interact with <b>Pol</b> η, <b>Pol</b> ζ, and Rev 1, suggesting a possible role of PolDIP 2 in the TLS reaction. However, the consequences of PolDIP 2 interaction on the properties of TLS <b>Pols</b> remain unknown. Here, we analyzed the effects of PolDIP 2 on normal and TLS by five different human specialized <b>Pols</b> from three families: <b>Pol</b> δ (family B), <b>Pol</b> η and <b>Pol</b> ι (family Y), and <b>Pol</b> λ and <b>Pol</b> β (family X). Our results show that PolDIP 2 also physically interacts with <b>Pol</b> λ, which is involved in the correct bypass of 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydroguanine (8 -oxo-G) lesions. This interaction increases both the processivity and catalytic efficiency of the error-free bypass of a 8 -oxo-G lesion by both <b>Pols</b> η and λ, but not by <b>Pols</b> β or ι. Additionally, we provide evidence that PolDIP 2 stimulates <b>Pol</b> δ without affecting its fidelity, facilitating the switch from <b>Pol</b> δ to <b>Pol</b> λ during 8 -oxo-G TLS. PolDIP 2 stimulates <b>Pols</b> λ and η mediated bypass of other common DNA lesions, such as abasic sites and cyclobutane thymine dimers. Finally, PolDIP 2 silencing increases cell sensitivity to oxidative stress and its effect is further potentiated in a <b>Pol</b> λ deficient background, suggesting that PolDIP 2 is an important mediator for TLS...|$|R
5|$|Luftflotte 2 {{was well}} {{used in this}} way. Operations against Kenley, Biggin Hill, North Weald and Hornchurch had the {{potential}} to destroy 11 Group's major sector stations and impair its defences. It would also draw the defending fighters into battle. The attempt to attack Kenley, however, failed and 9 Staffel KG 76 paid a high price. The weather prevented any chance of the raids on Hornchurch and North Weald being successful. On the other hand, Luftflotte 3 had poor intelligence, and its raids on the radar stations were ineffective. Radar elimination would enable the Luftwaffe to destroy the command and control system of Fighter Command, but despite the severe damage done to the <b>Poling</b> station, the existence of other stations nearby gave the system plenty of cover. The airfields the Air Fleet attacked at Ford, Gosport and Thorney Island {{had nothing to do with}} the main battle as they belonged to Coastal Command and the FAA.

5|$|At 13:59, <b>Poling</b> {{radar station}} {{picked up the}} German {{formations}} and reported them as 80 strong. Smaller forces ranging from 9 to 20-plus represented the German fighters moving up behind it. The British estimated the Luftwaffe attack force to be 150 aircraft strong. It was an underestimation by half. No. 10 Group RAF and No. 11 Group alerted their units from their operations rooms at Uxbridge and Box in Wiltshire. No. 10 and 11 Groups dispatched more Squadrons to support the already airborne 11 Hurricanes from No. 601 Squadron. 10 Group dispatched one Squadron each from RAF Middle Wallop, RAF Exeter and RAF Warmwell, and one each from No. 11's RAF Tangmere and RAF Westhampnett. The RAF order of battle included; nine Hurricanes of No. 43 Squadron RAF, led by Squadron Leader Frank Reginald Carey patrolling Thorney Island; No. 602 Squadron RAF protected Westhampnett with 12 Spitfires; No. 152 Squadron RAF and 11 Spitfires patrolled Portsmouth air space; No. 234 Squadron RAF with 11 Spitfires over the Isles of Wight to engage the attackers; No. 213 Squadron RAF with 12 Hurricanes which were to move 80 miles eastward from Exeter and patrol St. Catherine's Point. Finally, No. 609 Squadron RAF and 12 Spitfires remained in reserve around Middle Wallop to meet any unexpected German moves.|$|E

40|$|Escherichia coli {{has three}} DNA polymerases {{implicated in the}} bypass of DNA damage, a process called translesion {{synthesis}} (TLS) that alleviates replication stalling. Although these polymerases are specialized for different DNA lesions, it is unclear if they interact differently with the replication machinery. Of the three, DNA polymerase (<b>Pol)</b> II remains the most enigmatic. Here we report a stable ternary complex of <b>Pol</b> II, the replicative polymerase <b>Pol</b> III core complex and the dimeric processivity clamp, β. Single-molecule experiments reveal that the interactions of <b>Pol</b> II and <b>Pol</b> III with β allow for rapid exchange during DNA synthesis. As with another TLS polymerase, <b>Pol</b> IV, increasing concentrations of <b>Pol</b> II displace the <b>Pol</b> III core during DNA synthesis in a minimal reconstitution of primer extension. However, in contrast to <b>Pol</b> IV, <b>Pol</b> II is inefficient at disrupting rolling-circle synthesis by the fully reconstituted <b>Pol</b> III replisome.

Generation of <b>pol</b> knock down cells {{makes it possible to}} combine the <b>pol</b> null phenotype with deficiencies in other DNA repair proteins, thereby helping to elucidate the role of <b>pol</b> and its interactions with other proteins in mammalian cells...|$|R
40|$|To {{characterize}} proteins {{associated with}} active transcription complexes, we purified RNA polymerase II (<b>pol</b> II) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae after fixing live cells with formaldehyde. The approach mimics ChIP and requires solubilizing cross-linked complexes with sonication. <b>Pol</b> II was affinity-purified, and associated proteins {{were identified by}} MS. Several classes of proteins depended on cross-linking, including Mediator, general transcription factors, elongation factors, ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) proteins, and histones. A tagged RNP protein reciprocally purified <b>pol</b> II under identical cross-linking conditions, and the association between RNP proteins and <b>pol</b> II was largely RNase-sensitive. The data indicate that the cross-linked <b>Pol</b> II purification contains elongating <b>pol</b> II with associated nascent RNP. Consistent with this view, some elongation factors no longer associate with <b>pol</b> II after inactivation of transcription in the temperature-sensitive <b>pol</b> II mutant, rpb 1 - 1. Taken together, our {{data suggest that the}} cross-linked <b>pol</b> II purification contains a mixed population of <b>pol</b> II, including initiating <b>pol</b> II and elongating <b>pol</b> II...|$|R
40|$|SummaryMultisubunit RNA polymerases (msRNAPs) exhibit high {{sequence}} and structural homology, especially within their active sites, {{which is generally}} thought to result in msRNAP functional conservation. However, we show that mutations in the trigger loop (TL) in the largest subunit of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) yield phenotypes unexpected from studies of <b>Pol</b> II. For example, a well-characterized gain-of-function mutation in <b>Pol</b> II results in loss of function in <b>Pol</b> I (<b>Pol</b> II: rpb 1 - E 1103 G; <b>Pol</b> I: rpa 190 -E 1224 G). Studies of chimeric <b>Pol</b> II enzymes hosting <b>Pol</b> I or <b>Pol</b> III TLs suggest that consequences of mutations that alter TL dynamics are dictated by the greater enzymatic context and not solely the TL sequence. Although the rpa 190 -E 1224 G mutation diminishes polymerase activity, when combined with mutations that perturb <b>Pol</b> I catalysis, it enhances polymerase function, similar to the analogous <b>Pol</b> II mutation. These results suggest that <b>Pol</b> I and <b>Pol</b> II have different rate-limiting steps...|$|R
