The first type of silanated <b>PEG</b> was prepared by direct coupling of m-PEG with 3 -isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane through a urethane bond (silanated <b>PEG</b> I). The second type of silanated <b>PEG</b> (silanated <b>PEG</b> II) contained a long hydrophobic domain between <b>PEG</b> and silane domains. m-PEG was reacted with 1, 6 -diisocyanatohexane and 10 -undecen- 1 -ol in sequence before silylation with 3 -mercaptopropyl trimethoxysflane. ^ Silanated <b>PEGs</b> I and II were grafted onto glass, a model surface used in this study. The PEG-grafted glass surfaces were characterized by contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). More <b>PEG</b> molecules were grafted onto the surface as the bulk concentration used for grafting was increased. <b>PEG</b> grafting by two different methods, the grafting in 95 % ethanol and in anhydrous toluene resulted in different surface topographies as examined by AFM. Glass surfaces modified with silanated <b>PEGs</b> reduced fibrinogen adsorption as compared with the control surface. The surface fibrinogen concentration on PEG-modified surfaces was mainly dependent on the type of silanated <b>PEGs,</b> <b>PEG</b> molecular weight. Silanated <b>PEGs</b> provided a simple method for <b>PEG</b> grafting to the surface containing hydroxyl groups. ^ Crossliking of disilylated <b>PEG</b> by sol-gel transition of end silanes resulted in <b>PEG</b> gels.

After swelling at low temperature (5 °C), the Pluronic ®F- 127 gel release fluorescein fast when it was transferred into the medium of 45 °C temperature. ^ Silylated <b>PEG</b> and <b>PEG</b> derivatives can be used for surface modification of biomaterials and for controlled drug delivery. ...|$|R
