40|$|The article {{considers}} <b>process</b> <b>fluids,</b> {{which are}} presently applied to aviation hydraulic systems in domestic and world practice. Aviation practice deals with rather wide list of fluids. Based {{on the technical}} specification a designer makes the choice of specific fluid for the specific aircraft. <b>Process</b> <b>fluids</b> have to possess the specified properties presented in the article, namely: lubricating properties; stability of physical and chemical characteristics at operation and storage; lowtemperature properties; acceptable congelation temperature; compatibility with materials of units and components of hydraulic systems; heat conductivity; high rigidity; minimum low coefficient of volume expansion; fire-explosion safety; low density. They should also have good dielectric properties, be good to resist to destruction of molecules, have good anticorrosion and antierosion properties, as well as not create conditions for emerging electro-kinetic erosion of spooltype and other precision devices, {{and a number of}} other properties. The article presents materials on the oil-based <b>process</b> <b>fluids</b> with + (200 - 320) °C boiling temperature, gelled by a polymer of vinyl butyl ether, with aging inhibitor and dye for hydraulic systems of the subsonic and transonic aircraft which are combustible, with a temperature interval of use from — 60 oС до + 125 oС. It also describes materials on <b>process</b> <b>fluids,</b> which are based on the mix of polydialkylsiloxane oligomers with organic diester aging inhibitors, and wear-resistant additive to be applied to the hydraulic systems of supersonic aircrafts using a fluid within the temperature interval from - 6 О oС to + 175 oС for a long duration. The fire-explosion safety <b>process</b> <b>fluids</b> representing a mix of phosphoric esters with additives to improve viscous, anti-oxidizing, anticorrosive and anti-erosive properties are considered as well. They are used within the temperature range from - 60 оС to + 125 оС with overheats up to + 150 оС. The article shows experimentally attained properties of <b>process</b> <b>fluids</b> for the aviation hydraulic systems.

50|$|The most {{straightforward}} way {{to quantify}} fairly uniform fouling is by stating the average deposit surface loading, i.e., kg of deposit per m² of surface area.

The normalized fouling rate (also in kg/m²s) will additionally account for the concentration of the foulant in the <b>process</b> <b>fluid</b> (kg/kg) during preceding operations, and is useful for comparison of fouling rates between different systems.

50|$|Detailed {{analysis}} {{suggested that}} the 8-inch pipe had failed due to creep cavitation at a high temperature while the pipe was under pressure. Failure had been accelerated by contact with molten zinc and there were indications that an elbow in the pipe had been at significantly higher temperature {{than the rest of}} the pipe. The hot elbow led to a non-return valve held between two pipe flanges by twelve bolts. After the disaster, two of the twelve bolts were found to be loose; the inquiry concluded that they were probably loose before the disaster. Nypro argued that the bolts had been loose, there had consequently been a slow leak of <b>process</b> <b>fluid</b> onto lagging leading eventually to a lagging fire, which had worsened the leak to the point where a flame had played undetected upon the elbow, burnt away its lagging and exposed the line to molten zinc, the line then failing with a bulk release of <b>process</b> <b>fluid</b> which extinguished the original fire, but subsequently ignited giving a small explosion which had caused failure of the bypass, a second larger release and a larger explosion. Tests failed to produce a lagging fire with leaked <b>process</b> <b>fluid</b> at process temperatures; one advocate of the 8-inch hypothesis then argued instead that there had been a gasket failure giving a leak with sufficient velocity to induce static charges whose discharge had then ignited the leak.|$|E
