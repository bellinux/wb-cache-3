50|$|Wiring a 3-way lamp is {{a simple}} matter of {{connecting}} the 3-way switch's two switched live wires (frequently red for the low-wattage circuit and blue for the medium-wattage circuit) from the switch to the two live terminals on the 3-way socket. The lamp's power cord must be connected so that the wire from the wide blade on the <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> <b>plug</b> (neutral) connects to the neutral terminal on the socket, and the wire from the narrow blade on the plug (hot) connects to the black wire on the switch.|$|E
5000|$|Man {{is using}} {{electric}} trimmer to cut hedges around exterior of home. Trimmer is plugged into outlet on exterior of home 75 feet from where man is working. The trimmer switch {{is locked in}} the [...] "on" [...] position and in normal use. Extending {{beyond the reach of}} the trimmer's power cord, the plug is accidentally pulled from the outlet on the house 75 feet away. The man puts down the trimmer, switch still locked in the [...] "on" [...] position, and walks with his back away from the trimmer towards the outlet. A 4-year-old boy playing nearby sees the trimmer on the ground and approaches it. He picks it up with both hands. Back still turned, the man re-inserts the trimmer's <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> <b>plug</b> into the outlet. The trimmer starts immediately, severely injuring the boy's fingers on both hands.|$|E

50|$|The {{picture to}} the right shows the {{interior}} of a standard residential service, North American General Electric style breaker panel. The three power wires - two hot and one neutral - can be seen coming in at the top. The neutral wire is connected to the neutral busbar to the left with all the white wires, and the other two are the hot wires attached to the main breaker. Below it are the two rows of circuit breakers with the circuits' red and black hot wires leading off. Three wires (hot black, neutral white, and bare ground) can be seen directly exiting the box and running to a NEMA 5-15 electrical receptacle with a <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> <b>plugged</b> into it. The incoming bare stranded ground wire can be seen {{near the bottom of the}} neutral bus bar.|$|R
50|$|International <b>power</b> <b>cords</b> and <b>plug</b> {{adapters}} {{are used}} in conjunction with electrical appliances in countries different from those in which they were designed to operate. Besides a cord with one end compatible to receptacles or a device from one country and the other end compatible with receptacles or devices from another country, a voltage converter is usually necessary, as well, to protect travelers' electronic devices, such as laptops, from the differing voltages between the United States and places like Europe or Africa.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{familiar}} form of radio receiver is a broadcast receiver, often just called a radio, which receives audio programs intended for public reception transmitted by local radio stations. The sound is reproduced either by a loudspeaker {{in the radio}} or an earphone which plugs into a jack on the radio. The radio requires electric power, provided either by batteries inside the radio or a <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> which <b>plugs</b> into an electric outlet. All radios have a volume control to adjust the loudness of the audio, and some type of [...] "tuning" [...] control to select the radio station to be received.|$|R
5000|$|The {{diagrams}} {{at right}} show a typical ground loop {{caused by a}} signal cable S connecting two grounded electronic components C1 and C2. The loop consists of the signal cable's ground conductor, which is connected through the components' metal chassis to the ground wires P in their [...] "three wire" [...] <b>power</b> <b>cords,</b> which are <b>plugged</b> into outlet grounds which are connected through the building's utility ground wire system G.|$|R
5000|$|A cheater plug, AC ground lifter or three-prong/two-prong adapter is an adapter {{that allows}} a NEMA 5-15P grounding-type plug (three prongs) to connect to a NEMA 1-15R non-grounding {{receptacle}} (two slots). [...] They are needed to allow appliances with 3-wire <b>power</b> <b>cords</b> to <b>plug</b> into legacy ungrounded (two slot) receptacles found in older buildings. The use of such an adapter avoids the need to replace receptacles, but is potentially hazardous if the grounding tab is not connected to electrical ground. A safer and more reliable alternative identified in the US and Canadian electrical codes is to replace the outlet with a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) breaker outlet. These adapters are illegal in some jurisdictions, in particular throughout Canada.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{vibrators}} are {{marketed as}} [...] "body massagers"â€”although they still may be used, {{like the ones}} sold as adult sex toys, for autoeroticism. Some vibrators run on batteries while others have a <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> that <b>plugs</b> into a wall socket. There is also a vibrator that uses the flow of air from a vacuum cleaner to stimulate the clitoris. Modern versions of old musical vibrators synchronize the vibrations to music from a music player or a cell phone. Some luxury brand vibrators are also completely covered in medical grade silicone with no exposed control panels or seams. Although proper cleaning is required for any sex toy, having fewer places for bacteria to grow reduces the chance of infection.|$|R
5000|$|The popular [...] "Idiot Box" [...] mural {{that was}} created by Unmitigated Audacity Productions. The mural was located on the side wall of a large terrace house at 64 Erskineville Road, {{opposite}} the renowned Imperial Hotel. It featured a surrealistic portrait of the television character, Marcia Brady, from The Brady Bunch, brandishing an automatic pistol; the mural was painted {{as if she was}} bursting through the shattering glass of a television screen. The TV itself is painted in a trompe l'oeil effect, apparently breaking through the brick wall of the house on which the mural is painted. The power switch and <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> and <b>plug</b> of the TV were applied objects made from plastic. This significant mural, which had been in place since 1993, was removed by the then owners of the property in November/December 2006.|$|R
40|$|The Leakage Current Sentinel (LCS) {{has been}} {{designed}} and implemented {{for the detection of}} hazardous situations caused by dangerous earth leakage current values in intensive care units and operating theaters. The device, designed and manufactured with full compliance of the high risk environment requirements, is able to monitor online the earth leakage current and detect ground wire faults. Operation utilizes a microammeter with an overall sensitivity of 2. 5 x 10 (4) V/A. In order to assure the reliability of the device in providing alarm signals, the simultaneous presence of absorbed power current is monitored by means of another ammeter with decreased sensitivity (3. 0 V/A). The measured root mean square current values are compared with reference values in order to send signals to NAND and OR complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor gates to enable audible and visible alarms according to the possible hazardous cases examined in the article. The final LCS packaging was shaped as a wall socket adapter for common electromedical device <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> <b>plugs,</b> with particular attention to minimizing its dimensions and to provide analog voltage outputs for both measured leakage and power currents, in order to allow automatic data acquisition and computerized hazardous situation management. Finally, a personal computer based automatic measuring system has been configured to simultaneously monitor several LCSs installed in the same intensive care unit room and, as a consequence, to distinguish different hazardous scenarios and provide an adequate alert to the clinical personnel whose final decision is still required. The test results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the LCS in giving an alert in case of leakage current anomalous values, either in case of a ground fault or in case of a dangerous leakage current...|$|R
50|$|The LGP-30 {{required}} 1500 watts when {{operating under}} full load. The <b>power</b> inlet <b>cord</b> was <b>plugged</b> into any standard 115 volt 60 cycle single phase line. The computer contained internal voltage regulation against power line variations of voltages from 95 to 130 volts. In addition to regulation of power line variations, the computer also contained the circuitry required to permit a warm-up stage. This warm-up stage minimized thermal shock to tubes to ensure long component life. The computer contained its own blower unit and directed filtered air, through ducts, to tubes and diodes, {{in order to}} ensure component life and proper operation. No expensive air conditioning needed to be installed if operated within a reasonable temperature range.|$|R
5000|$|All four Stroboflash models {{consisted}} of a power pack that connected to a separate flash head via a <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> and special <b>plug</b> and all used the same Stroboflash flash heads, which were light weight and had a satin reflector that produced very soft, non directional light. Professional photographers used Stroboflash II and IV electronic flashes extensively in the 50's through 80's because of the soft, well diffused light they produce. The Stroboflash electronic flash units are still considered flashes that produce excellent quality high power lighting, but the battery expense {{and the fact that}} the batteries only produce between 1,000 to 2,000 flashes (depending on the power level selected) {{and the fact that the}}se flash batteries were not rechargeable led to professionals replacing these flashes with other models that were powered by batteries that could be recharged.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{variation}} is called flex track or monorail track lighting {{in which the}} fixtures are hung from a single line monorail track attached to the ceiling using stems. There are several different types of track. Some are very flexible and can be curved in any shape or form and some are more rigid and can be curved very slightly. Some patterns {{that can be made}} are [...] "S curves" [...] or [...] "spirals". Various adapters are available for combining features of track and other lighting. There are [...] "L" [...] and [...] "T" [...] adapters for rigid track, as well as flexible ones for unusual angles, or to change the vertical angle where a ceiling changes slope. Adapter plates allow single fixtures to be attached directly to a junction box, by providing an extremely small section of track embedded into the plate. There are also arms which have the same feature, allowing fixtures to be mounted onto the same wall they shine onto, and having an attached <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> and wall <b>plug.</b>|$|R
