25|$|The {{process is}} subject to both burst errors and random errors. Burst errors include those due to disc {{material}} (defects of aluminum reflecting film, poor reflective index of transparent disc material), disc production (faults during disc forming and disc cutting etc.), disc handling (scratches – generally thin, radial and orthogonal to direction of recording) and variations in <b>play-back</b> mechanism. Random errors include those due to jitter of reconstructed signal wave and interference in signal. CIRC (Cross-Interleaved Reed–Solomon code) {{is the basis for}} error detection and correction in the CD process. It corrects error bursts up to 3,500 bits in sequence (2.4nbsp&mm in length as seen on CD surface) and compensates for error bursts up to 12,000 bits (8.5nbsp&mm) that may be caused by minor scratches.|$|E

Elephants produce low-fre-quency vocalizations at such high amplitudes that they couple with the ground and travel along {{the surface of the earth}} with a separate velocity than their airborne counterparts (45, 16). There are physical properties of seismic cues that, if detected on their own or in combi-nation with acoustic cues, could enhance the ele-phant’s ability to interpret signals (44, 45). Elephants respond vigilantly to alarm call vocaliza-tions transmitted through the ground, demonstrating that they can detect seismic information from back-ground noise (43). In addition, elephants can also discriminate subtle differences between seismic <b>play-backs</b> of the same call type made by different callers (40). Elephants are well equipped to detect seismic cues through either bone conduction, somatosensory reception, or both (Ref. 6; O’Connell-Rodwell CE...|$|R
40|$|Magpie (Pica pica) brood {{defense against}} a human at the nest was studied in a Mediterranean {{population}} with low renesting potential. Variations in two defense measures recorded during 106 trials at 41 different nests were {{positively correlated with}} brood age. Ineremental effects due {{to the number of}} successive visits to nests by us, brood size, and the time in the breeding season were not significant. Partial correlation analyses showed that visit rate was not an important determinant of nest defense, which thus favors an adaptive explanation of nest defense patterns. Two functional hypotheses to account for the increase in defense intensity with brood age were tested: whether (1) increased parental defense serves to compensate the higher predation risk of older nests or (2) increased parental defense reflects the increasing reproductive value of nestlings as they grow older. Daily mortality and incidende of predation (estimated from contribution of whole-brood losses to total mortality) was higher early in the nestling period, hence providing weak evidence for the assumption on which hypothesis (1) is based. The timing of parental defense intensity did not mirror variations in predation risk for the nest but variations in reproductive value of the brood, as can be estimated from daily mortality, thus supporting hypothesis (2). Magpie parents increased defense intensity in response to premature escaping by almost fully-developed nestlings. Since such a response lowers predation risk for the offspring and increases their probability of survival, this finding supports hypothesis (2), but runs contrary to hypothesis (1). Parents also increased defense in response to <b>play-backs</b> of alarm calls uttered by nestlings during escaping episodes. It is argued that parents should continuously monitor the degree of offspring development in order to assess their reproductive value and that, by alarm calling, chicks honestly make their parents aware of the gain in reproductive value that results from enhancement in locomotory abilities that occur {{at the end of the}} nestling period.

50|$|Until 1947 Malayalam {{films were}} made by Tamil {{producer}}s. Artist P. J. Cherian was the first Malayali producer to venture into this field and the trend then changed. He produced Nirmala in 1948 with Joseph Cherian and Baby Joseph his son and daughter-in-law in the lead roles as hero and heroine. He also cast many other family members in other roles, breaking the taboo that noble family people do not take up acting. Thus Nirmala became the first film produced by a Malayali, setting many firsts for introducing <b>play-back</b> singing, cinema with a social theme where the entire family could sit together and watch it. Artist P.J. Cherian was the first cinema producer to explore the possibility of music and songs in cinema, and thus became the pioneer to introduce <b>play-back</b> singing in cinema.
