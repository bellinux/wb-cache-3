5|$|In 1914, Franck {{teamed up}} with Hertz to perform an {{experiment}} to investigate fluorescence. They designed a vacuum tube for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapour of mercury atoms.

A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> same amount of its kinetic energy. Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy.|$|E

30|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the vlogger does not scratch in sync with the rhythm, tonicity and tonality of the text; the scratching lasts for two and a half tone groups, and does not match the timing of salient and tonic syllables.

5|$|Andriamanelo is {{typically}} {{portrayed as a}} civilizing king {{in contrast to the}} primitive Vazimba against whom he waged war. As such, oral history credits him with discovering such diverse arts as silversmithing and astrology (sikidy) in addition to iron working. He reputedly introduced knowledge about the construction and use of pirogues, and was the first in the highlands to transform lowland swamps into irrigated rice paddies through the construction of dikes in the valleys around Alasora. The Merina rite of circumcision, described by Bloch (1986) in great detail, continued to be practiced by the Merina monarchy {{through the end of the}} 19th century in <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> way first established by Andriamanelo generations before.

5|$|Avery Brundage had no {{children}} with either of his wives. During his first marriage, however, Brundage fathered two sons out of wedlock with his Finnish mistress, Lilian Dresden. His affair with Dresden was one of many. The children were born in 1951 and 1952, at <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> time that Brundage was being considered for {{the presidency of the}} IOC. Though he privately acknowledged paternity, Brundage took great pains to conceal the existence of these children, concerned that the truth about his extra-marital relationships might damage his chances of election: he requested that his name be kept off the birth certificates. Brundage visited his two sons periodically in the 1950s, visits that tailed off to telephone calls in the 1960s and nothing in his final years. He did establish a trust fund for the boys' education and start in life, but after his death, unnamed in his will, they sued and won a small settlement of $62,500 each out of his $19 million estate.|$|E

5|$|In {{some cases}} the signal {{receiver}} is lured toward the mimic.

If the bait offered is of little value to prey {{they would not be}} expected to take such a risk. For example, in all known cases of sexual signal mimicry it is always the male sex that is deceived (in fact, {{it has been suggested that}} females of some species have evolved mimicry as a strategy to avoid unwanted matings). In these cases the predator need not move about foraging for prey, but may simply stay still and allow prey to come to it.|$|E

5|$|Messiaen used modes {{he called}} modes of limited transposition. They are {{distinguished}} as groups of notes {{that can only}} be transposed by a semitone a limited number of times. For example, the whole-tone scale (Messiaen's Mode 1) only exists in two transpositions: namely C–D–E–F–G–A and D–E–F–G–A–B. Messiaen abstracted these modes from the harmony of his improvisations and early works. Music written using the modes avoids conventional diatonic harmonic progressions, since for example Messiaen's Mode 2 (identical to the octatonic scale used also by other composers) permits <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> dominant seventh chords whose tonic the mode does not contain.|$|E
