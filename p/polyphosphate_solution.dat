40|$|Transparent and {{homogeneous}} aluminophosphate gels {{and glasses}} {{have been widely}} synthesized through an aqueous sol-gel route, extending significantly the glass-forming range compared to that accessible via the melt-cooling route. Different phosphorus precursors, sodium polyphosphate (NaPO 3) and orthophosphate species (NaH 2 PO 4 and/or H 3 PO 4) were compared {{with regard to the}} macroscopic properties and the microscopic structure of the resultant gels and glasses as characterized by extensive high-resolution liquid- and solid-state NMR. Sodium <b>polyphosphate</b> <b>solution</b> results in a substantially wider composition range of homogenous gel formation than orthophosphate solutions, and the two routes produce significant structural differences in the sol and xerogel states. Nevertheless, the structures of the glasses obtained upon gel annealing above 400 degrees C are independent of the P-precursors used. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, an {{attempt was made}} to explore the {{benefits}} of polyphosphate for enhancement of dried prawn (Parapenaeopsis stylifera) quality commercially known as "sode" in Maharashtra coast. Dip treatment in <b>polyphosphate</b> <b>solution</b> at different concentrations (viz., 3, 5, 7 and 10 %) was given to pealed and no deveined P. stylifera for different durations (viz., 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 min). Treated prawns were dried and subjected to rehydration capacity test and organoleptic evaluation. Among the different treatments, rehydration capacity was found to increase with the increased duration and concentration of treatment. Tiny prawns treated with sodium tripolyphosphate solution at the rate of 5 % concentration for 5 minutes showed an increase in pH from acidic to alkaline, and had better quality with respect to rehydration capacity and textural attributes as compared to other concentrations and durations of polyphosphate treatment...|$|E
40|$|A rapid {{method for}} {{screening}} drug seizure samples for 3, 6 -diacetylmorphine (heroin), {{which consists of}} a simple hydrolysis procedure and flow-injection analysis with two chemiluminescence reagents, is described. Before hydrolysis, 3, 6 -diacetylmorphine evokes an intense response with a tris(2, 22 ̆ 7 -bipyridyl) ruthenium(III) reagent (prepared by dissolving the perchlorate salt in acetonitrile), and a relatively weak chemiluminescence response with a second reagent: potassium permanganate in an aqueous acidic <b>polyphosphate</b> <b>solution.</b> However, the permanganate reagent is extremely sensitive toward the hydrolysis products of 3, 6 -diacetylmorphine (i. e., 6 -monoacetylmorphine and morphine). Some compounds commonly found in drug laboratories may cause false positives with tris(2, 22 ̆ 7 -bipyridyl) ruthenium(III), but do not produce the markedly increased response with the permanganate reagent after the hydrolysis procedure. The combination of these two tests therefore provides an effective presumptive test {{for the presence of}} 3, 6 -diacetylmorphine, which we have verified with 14 samples obtained from a forensic science laboratory...|$|E
40|$|Polyphosphates are {{commonly}} used industrially to provide electrostatic stabilisation to mineral and material suspensions. <b>Polyphosphate</b> <b>solutions</b> however have shown instability under processing conditions such as high temperature and acidic pH which {{may lead to a}} reduction in dispersion properties when added to mineral or material suspensions. In this study the influence of pH, temperature and divalent cation concentration pre-treatment on polyphosphate dispersion properties is reported. Dispersion properties are determined using rheological suspension analysis. The suspensions investigated are material-based model systems of titania pigment and high purity boehmite. Infrared spectroscopy studies of <b>polyphosphate</b> <b>solutions</b> were undertaken to directly investigate the polyphosphate structure after pre-treatment. The rheological measurements show reduced polyphosphate dispersion properties with reduced pH, increased temperature and at high calcium concentrations which correlate with directly measured and reported changes in the polyphosphate structure. When pH, temperature and high divalent cation concentrations are combined, the synergistic effect on reduced polyphosphate dispersion performance is particularly prominent...|$|R

40|$|This {{communication}} {{reports the}} changes in physical, organoleptic and biochemical characteristics of prawn meat dip-treated with alkaline and neutral <b>solutions</b> of <b>polyphosphates</b> during frozen storage. Results are presented on changes in thawed and cooked yields, water extractable nitrogen, non-protein nitrogen, free amino-nitrogen, salt solubility, myosin and moisture in the muscle and loss of soluble nitrogenous constituents in thaw drip during frozen storage up to seven months. The salt solubility remained unchanged during storage in samples treated with neutral <b>polyphosphate</b> <b>solutions</b> and the organoleptic quality was superior to control sample. It is concluded that dip treatment with neutralized solutions of tripolyphosphate not only maintains correct drained weight and improves cooked yield during prolonged frozen storage but also protects the frozen product from denaturation {{as measured by the}} salt solubility of the proteins...|$|R
40|$|Chloride ion {{penetration}} through concrete to {{reinforcing steel}} {{is causing the}} premature deterioration of numerous bridge decks in Iowa. The purpose of the research reported in this paper {{was to determine whether}} any of several additives or alternative deicing chemicals could inhibit corrosion of reinforcing steel. The deicers tested were calcium magnesium acetate (CMA), CMA plus NaCl (NaCl: sodium chloride), Quicksalt plus PCI, and CG- 90, a <b>polyphosphate</b> <b>solution</b> being developed by Cargill. Two tests were established. First, steel coupons were placed in a 15 % solution of a deicer and distilled water to determine which alternative deicer would cause the least amount of corrosion in solution. The coupons were weighed periodically to determine each coupon's weight loss from corrosion. The second test involved ponding a 15 % solution of each material on reinforced concrete blocks. Weekly copper-copper sulfate electrical half-cell (CSE) potential readings were taken on each block to determine whether corrosive activity was occurring at the steel surface. When the ponding research was concluded, concrete samples were taken from one of the three blocks ponded with each deicer. The samples were used to determine the chloride ion content {{at the level of the}} steel. Results show that all the deicers were less corrosive than NaCl. Only pure CMA, however, significantly inhibited the corrosion of steel embedded in concrete...|$|E

A. permitted level of 3 % decreased weight loss during storage, improved cooking yields and lowered shear values of breast meat. Carcasses were selected at a broiler processing plant {{and subjected to}} a 3 X 3 factorial arrangement of treatments that included three chilling treatments (dry chilled, chilled in 3 °C. water and chilled in 3 °C. water after prechilling in 10 ° C. water) and three injection treatments (control, water and 12 % <b>polyphosphate</b> <b>solution).</b> Weight loss of carcasses was highest during the first 24 hours of 3 °C. storage and similar for all chilling and injection treatments. However, over the entire 7 -day storage period the phosphate injection treatments seemed to retard the weight loss of water chilled treatments. Net gains through chilling, injection and 3 ° C. storage were about 20 gms. for most non-injected or water injected carcasses, but were 40 gms. or more for phosphate injected water chilled birds. Average cooked yields were higher for phosphate injection treatments (84. 4 %) than for control (82. 9 %) or water injection (82. 2 %).

40|$|Abstract – Study Design: Posterior and posterolateral fusions were {{performed}} in rabbit lumbar spines. Objectives: To investigate the osteoinductive effect of polyphosphates. Summary and Literature review: Inorganic polyphosphates {{are known to}} be rich in osteoblasts and involved in the mineraliza-tion process in bone metabolism. However, no study has been undertaken to investigate the osteoinductive effect of polyphos-phates. Materials and Methods: Forty adult New Zealand white rabbits underwent monolevel lumbar fusions, and were divided into two groups according to the fusion beds: twenty each between the laminae (posterior fusion group, PF group) and between the transverse processes (posterolateral fusion group, PLF group). In ten of twenty rabbits in the PF group, 0. 8 gm of autogenous iliac bone was grafted onto the right sides of the laminae, which were used as a control group (C 1), with 0. 4 gm autogenous bone immersed in <b>polyphosphate</b> <b>solution</b> in the left sides as an experimental group (E 1). In the other ten, 0. 8 gm of autogenous bone was grafted onto the right sides (C 2) and 0. 8 gm of tricalcium phosphate porous blocks containing polyphosphate in the left sides (E 2). The other twenty rabbits of the PLF group were similarly divided into C 1, E 1, C 2 and E 2 groups by grafting the same amount of materials between the transverse processes. The animals were sacrificed at the 16 th postoperative week and the fusions evaluated grossly, radiologically and histologically.

40|$|AbstractEuropium-substituted {{lanthanum}} phosphates (Eu; 5 mol%) {{were prepared}} from lanthanum nitrate, europium nitrate, and sodium <b>polyphosphate</b> <b>solutions</b> by a hydrothermal process at 120 and 160 °C up to 8 h. The obtained phosphates were studied using XRD, IR spectroscopy, TG–DTA, and SEM. UV–vis absorbance and reflectance, {{as well as}} fluorescence, were estimated as functional properties of these phosphate materials. We found that samples prepared without hydrothermal treatment were amorphous (as indicated by their XRD patterns), whereas those prepared by a hydrothermal treatment contained peaks corresponding to lanthanum orthophosphate, indicating that the hydrothermal process caused the polyphosphate(s) to decompose into orthophosphate(s). The TG–DTA curves of the samples prepared by a hydrothermal treatment were {{different from those of}} the samples prepared without hydrothermal treatment. All samples reported herein had no specified shape despite using prolonged hydrothermal treatment times. Although the samples prepared without hydrothermal treatment showed only weak fluorescence peaks, those prepared by a hydrothermal treatment showed strong peaks at 556, 590, 615, and 690 nm. These peaks corresponded to transitions from 5 D 0 to 7 F 0, 7 F 1, 7 F 2, and 7 F 4, respectively. Collectively, these results indicate that the hydrothermal treatment is a useful method of obtaining europium-substituted lanthanum phosphates with fluorescence properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of agricultural crops to liquid and solid phosphate fertilizers containing dicarboxylic acid copolymers (DCACP) {{has recently been}} explored through field trials carried out across the United States. The results {{of many of these}} field trials have demonstrated significant enhancements in both yield and quality, as well as favorable returns on investment, when DCACP are placed in close proximity to the fertilizer, for example, by spray-coating DCACP onto granular monoammonium phosphate (MAP, 11 - 52 - 0) or by adding DCACP to ammonium <b>polyphosphate</b> <b>solutions</b> (APP, 10 - 34 - 0). One common observation is that lower amounts of phosphorus can be applied by using the polymer without any tradeoff in yield or quality – a result that is particularly advantageous when fertilizer prices are high. The mode of action of DCACP is explained by the high degree of negative charge on the polymer backbone (CEC = 1800 cmol kg- 1) which results in sequestration of multivalent metal cations such as calcium, magnesium, aluminum, or iron that would otherwise combine with fertilizer phosphate and render it unavailable to growing crops. Essentially, DCACP are utilized to maintain fertilizer phosphate in an available form during the growing season, but are not effective at releasing phosphate already tied up in soils. Increased efficiency gained through applications of DCACP to phosphate fertilizers presents an attractive option to developing modern fertility programs...|$|R

40|$|The {{methods used}} to {{concentrate}} enteric viruses from water have remained largely unchanged for nearly 30 years, with the most common technique being the use of 1 MDS Virozorb filters followed by organic flocculation for secondary concentration. Recently, {{a few studies have}} investigated alternatives; however, many of these methods are impractical for use in the field or share some of the limitations of this traditional method. In the present study, the NanoCeram virus sampler, an electropositive pleated microporous filter composed of microglass filaments coated with nanoalumina fibers, was evaluated. Test viruses were first concentrated by passage of 20 liters of seeded water through the filter (average filter retention efficiency was ≥ 99. 8 %), and then the viruses were recovered using various salt-based or proteinaceous eluting solutions. A 1. 0 % sodium <b>polyphosphate</b> <b>solution</b> with 0. 05 M glycine was determined to be the most effective. The recovered viruses were then further concentrated using Centricon Plus- 70 centrifugal ultrafilters to a final volume of 3. 3 (± 0. 3 [standard deviation]) ml; this volume compares quite favorably to that of previously described methods, such as organic flocculation (∼ 15 to 40 ml). The overall virus recovery efficiencies were 66 % for poliovirus 1, 83 % for echovirus 1, 77 % for coxsackievirus B 5, 14 % for adenovirus 2, and 56 % for MS 2 coliphage. In addition, this method appears to be compatible with both cell culture and PCR assays. This new approach for the recovery of viruses from water is therefore a viable alternative to currently used methods when small volumes of final concentrate are an advantage...|$|E
40|$|In {{exploring}} {{methods to}} recycle boiler ash (BA) and {{waste water treatment}} sludge (WWTS), by-products generated from Keyspan's power plants, into commercially viable materials, we synthesized chemically bonded cements (CBC) offering the following three specific characteristics; (1) immobilization of hazardous heavy metals, such as Pb, Ni, and V, (2) rapid hardening and setting properties, and (3) development of high mechanical strength. The CBCs were prepared through an acid-base reaction between these by-products acting as the solid base reactants and the sodium <b>polyphosphate</b> <b>solution</b> as the cement-forming acid reactant, followed by a hydrating reaction. Furthermore, two additives, the calcium aluminate cements (CAC) and the calcium silicate cements (CSC) were incorporated into the CBC systems to improve their properties. Using a CBC formulation consisting of 53. 8 wt% WWTS, 23. 1 wt% CSC, and 23. 1 wt% [40 wt% -(-NaPO{sub 3 }-) -{sub n}]{sub 2 } the Toxicity Characteristics Leaching Procedure (TCLP) tests showed that the concentrations of Pb, Ni, and V metals leached out from the specimens were minimal. This formulation originally contained {approx} 28800 mg/kg of Pb, {approx} 6300 mg/kg of Ni, and {approx} 11130 mg/kg of V; the amounts leaching into the acid extraction fluid were only 0. 15 mg/L of Pb, 0. 15 mg/L of Ni, and 4. 63 mgiL of V. On the other hand, CBC specimens derived from a formulation consisting of 42 wt% BA, 18 wt% CAC and 40 wt% [40 wt% -(-NaPO{sub 3 }-) -{sub n}] displayed an excellent compressive strength of 10. 8 MPa at an early curing age of 2 hours after mixing at room temperature. The reason for its rapid hardening was due to a high exothermic energy evolved by the acid-base reaction. Furthermore, when these specimens were immersed for 28 days in water at 25 C, and exposed for 20 hours to steam at 80 C, a very high compressive strength of 3. 32 MPa developed. Two physico-chemical factors {{played an important role}} in improving the mechanical strength of the specimens: One was the formation of two well-crystallized phases, hydroxyapatite [Ca{sub 5 }(PO{sub 4 }) {sub 3 }(OH) ] and sodium vanadium sulfate hydrate [Na{sub 2 }V(SO{sub 4 }) {sub 2 }, 4 H{sub 2 }O], as the reaction products in the cement bodies; the other factor reflected the dense microstructure developed by the growth of these crystalline reaction products. Accordingly, the CBCs derived from these by-products have a high potential for use as remediating material for hazardous heavy metal-contaminated soils, as rapid-setting repair patching and filling materials for damaged roadways and bridge decks, and also as binders in precast concrete products, such as blocks, slabs, and pipes...|$|E

40|$|MnO 2 is {{a product}} of in-situ {{oxidation}} of trichloroethylene (TCE) by KMnO 4. This species tends to precipitate and hinder the oxidation process thereby reducing the treatment efficiency in more than one way. The main objective of this research was to enhance the mobility of MnO 2 precipitates using sequestration technique. A one dimensional column was designed to study the effect of sodium polyphosphate addition to the reaction solution containing KMnO 4. The solution was injected to the silica sand artificially contaminated by WE and the mass removal rates were studied against the removal rates when no polyphosphate was added into the reaction solution. TCE was added to polyphosphate and KMnO 4 solution in vial experiments to confirm the stabilization of MnO 2 precipitates in the presence of <b>polyphosphate.</b> Reaction <b>solutions</b> contained varying concentrations of KMnO 4 (500, 1000 and 2000 mg/L) and varying mass ratios of polyphosphate w. r. t. KMnO 4 (1 to 8). Optimum conditions w. r. t KMnO 4 and polyphosphate (mass ratio 1 : 4 at 1000 mg/L of KMnO 4) were generated and used in column experiments. It was observed that dissolution rate and consequently overall mass removal rate was enhanced in column experiments when in-situ oxidation took place in the presence of polyphosphate. This was probably because of sequestration of MnO 2 by polyphosphate which rendered WE more accessible to treatment. However, there was still some precipitation observed in the column when polyphosphate was added contrary to expectations from vial experiments results. Ionic strength of the solution in which reaction/precipitation/stabilization took place, was studied briefly during the vial experiments and higher ionic strength (3 ̆e 0. 05 M) seemed to affect the stabilization adversely. Reaction kinetics experiments were conducted to estimate the effect of addition of polyphosphate on oxidation rate. It was observed that this addition did not substantially affect the kinetic rate of reaction. Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

Among methods employed for the reduction of scale-formation is the use of certain substances which inhibit the crystallization of scale-forming materials. The present study is an investigation of some of the factors involved in the inhibition of crystallization from supersaturated solutions. The crystallization of CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O, both seeded and unseeded, from solutions containing sodium chloride and sodium tripolyphosphate, has been studied {{as a function of the}} supersaturation and of the concentration of polyphosphate additive. The processes occurring have been monitored by following the concentrations of calcium and <b>polyphosphate</b> species in <b>solution</b> with time, using compleximetric and colorimetric analysis. Both in the seeded and unseeded crystallization, the presence of polyphosphate led to the inhibition of crystallization. Induction periods have been shown to be logarithmically related to supersaturation and additive concentration and in the seeded case to be dependent on the mass of seed crystals for small amounts of seed. The interaction between tripolyphosphate in solution and calcium sulphate dihydrate has been studied by measurements of concentration loss from solution and the take-up of polyphosphate shown to involve processes other than simple sorption. In contrast with sorption of polyphosphates by less soluble adsorbents, such as barium or strontium sulphates, the take-up by calcium sulphate dihydrate is suggested to involve in initiation of the deposition of a substance containing calcium and polyphosphate on to the crystals.
