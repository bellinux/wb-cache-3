In the centre of Klirou was a 3 kilometer long underground water supply tunnel and two large water storage units, on the site known as Λίμνή (lake).

30|$|This new {{approach}} {{opened the way}} to a season of measures aimed at expanding the range of administrative, fiscal and credit incentives and benefits in favour of district enterprises, finally assimilating and equalising all the different types (and also industrial and agricultural districts) in this new notion. It is worth underlining that this is the sole, albeit important, new feature. In moving from the former to the latter definition of district, the government changed political approach, placing more emphasis on the role of entrepreneurial and private initiative than on that of the State. Nonetheless, political discussion about districts changed much more than did the legal approach. In fact the legal definition of <b>production</b> <b>district</b> included – albeit unnecessarily - explicit reference to the two principles of subsidiarity, thereby reconfirming the reciprocity as well as the cooperation necessary between private and public initiatives. In other words, the introduction of this new definition was justified more by general political aims than by a new economic policy stance.|$|E

Research undertaken quantitatively at Bowen evaluated the effectiveness of pre-harvest production systems without specific fruit fly controls and postharvest mitigation measures in reducing the risk of fruit fly infestation in tomato. A district-wide trapping using cue-lure baited traps was undertaken to determine fruit fly seasonal patterns in relation to the cropping seasons. A total of 17, 626 field-harvested and 11, 755 pack-house tomatoes were sampled from ten farms over three cropping seasons (2006 - 2009).

40|$|Life Cycle Assessment {{was applied}} to {{municipal}} planning {{in a study of}} waste water systems in Bergsjön, a Göteborg suburb, and Hamburgsund, a coastal village. Existing waste water treatment consists of mechanical, biological and chemical treatment. The heat in the waste water from Bergsjön is recovered for the district heating system. One alternative studied encompassed pretreatment, anaerobic digestion or drying of the solid fraction and treatment of the liquid fraction in sand filter beds. In another alternative, urine, faeces and grey water would separately be conducted out of the buildings. The urine would be used as fertilizer, whereas faeces would be digested or dried, before used in agriculture. The grey water would be treated in filter beds. Changes in the waste water system would affect surrounding technical systems (drinking water <b>production,</b> <b>district</b> heating and fertilizer production). This was approached through system enlargement. For Hamburgsund, both alternatives showed lower environmental impact than the existing system, and the urine separation system the lowest. Bergsjön results were more difficult to interpret. Energy consumption was lowest for the existing system, whereas air emissions were lower for the alternatives. Water emissions increased for some parameters and decreased for others. Phosphorous recovery was high for all three alternatives, whereas there was virtually no nitrogen recovery until urine separation was introduced...|$|E
40|$|Aims : To {{distinguish}} Italian Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) {{water buffalo}} Mozzarella from different producers on a molecular basis {{in relation to}} the place of manufacturing within the <b>production</b> <b>district,</b> and to develop a tool for genetic traceability of typical dairy products. Methods and Results : Microbial DNA was isolated from Mozzarella's governing liquid to amplify the whole microflora's ribosomal 16 S– 23 S internal transcribed spacers (ITS) -PCR fingerprinting by means of an original primer pair. Phylogenetic distance analyses were performed on the obtained electrophoretic band patterns by maximum parsimony and neighbour-joining tree construction algorithms for discrete binary data, using a conventional bootstrap resampling test. The observed band profiles showed high repeatability and specificity, allowing unambiguous distinction of each sample; phylogenetic analyses yielded the same tree topology with good strength of nodal support. Moreover, a relationship between the genetic distances among samples and the actual geographical ones separating the respective producing dairies was observed. Conclusions : The genetic diversity of PDO water buffalo Mozzarella's microflora, observed by ITS-PCR fingerprinting, can be exploited to discriminate cheeses from differently located dairies. Significance and Impact of the Study : Given the increasing importance of food traceability for safety, quality and typicalness issues, the ITS-PCR fingerprinting protocol described here may represent a suitable tool for tracing the geographical origin of Italian Mozzarella...|$|E

Both cases represent organizational structures using up-to-date production technologies and innovative management, with the work organized and divided according to a precise apportionment of roles, dominated by a top-down hierarchy of the different production units {{with a high level of}} interaction between the different workshops, coordinated by a director for each sector.

Anticipating the utopias of the Enlightenment, the two factories were equipped with buildings capable of allowing workers to live with their families in the same place as the factory by adopting a small-scale phalanstery-style solution at Capodimonte (73 units) and a larger one in San Leucio (a thousand workers at the beginning of the nineteenth century with a total of about 200 families by the mid nineteenth century).

Previous studies about the Priorat have pointed out geographical and environmental reasons to explain regional success. Other works have remarked marketing and internationalization aspects in justifying the extraordinary gained results. However, our empirical data, obtained through different interviews with the main characters and through observation show evidence of other reasons. The aim {{of this paper is to}} better understand the evolution of the Priorat over time and to inquire about the key success factors that have fostered its results, affecting also regional social and economic ground. Preliminary data show evidence that although there are many aspects which collide and contribute to this success, knowledge sharing and the development of a cluster or collective network play a crucial role. According to the above considerations, we have been able to identify those aspects that have fostered the rising of a local network, giving particular attention to knowledge sharing processes. First, our findings show that practice is the underlying key aspect which sustains the possibility of knowledge sharing. Second, there have been three mechanisms which have facilitated knowledge sharing within the network: the existence of boundary objects, the performance of a brokering role and finally, storytelling...|$|E
