500|$|With [...] "Human Stupidity", Creangă {{builds a}} fable about {{incompetence}} in its absolute forms. The story {{centers on a}} peasant's quest {{to find people who}} are less rational than his wife, having been infuriated by her panic at the remote possibility that a ball of salt could fall from its <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> and kill their baby. This, essayist and chronicler Simona Vasilache argues, highlights [...] "a family-based division" [...] of illogical behavior, in which women are depicted as the main propagators of both [...] "astonishing nonsense" [...] and [...] "prudent stupidity". Instead, literary critic Ion Pecie identified inside the narrative a meditation on [...] "the link between spirit and nature", with the unpredictable ball of salt representing the equivalent of a [...] "sphinx". His colleague Gheorghe Grigurcu argued that such conclusions [...] "may seem excessive", but that they were ultimately validated by the literary work being [...] "a plurality of levels". A similar piece is the prose fable [...] "The Story of a Lazy Man": fed up with the protagonist's proverbial indolence, which has led him as far as to view chewing food as an effort, his fellow villagers organize a lynching. This upsets the sensibility of a noblewoman who happens to witness the incident. When she offers to take the lazy man into her care and feed him bread crumbs, he seals his own fate by asking: [...] "But are your bread crumbs soft?" [...] The peculiar effect of this moral is underlined by Anghelescu: [...] "The lazy man dies as a martyr of his own immobility." [...] Braga interpreted the story as evidence of [...] "the primacy of ethics" [...] over social aspects in the local tradition. Ion Pecie saw in the story proof of Creangă's own support for capital punishment with a preventive or didactic purpose, even in cases were the fault was trivial or imagined, concluding: [...] "Here,... Creangă loses much of his depth." [...] Pecie's conclusion was treated with reserve by Grigurcu, who believed that, instead, the narrator refrains from passing any judgment on [...] "the community's instinctual eugenic reaction".|$|E

Here the boys passed through one after another of several large halls, which were formerly used for various purposes when the castle was inhabited, but are employed now for the storage of brass cannons, and of ammunition belonging to the Swiss government. When the castle was built, the country in which it stands belonged to a neighboring state, called Savoy; and it was the Duke of Savoy, who was a sort of king, that built it, and it was he that confined the prisoners in it so cruelly. Many of them were confined there on account of being accused of conspiring against his government. At length, however, the war broke out between Switzerland and Savoy, and the Swiss were victorious. They besieged this castle by an army on the land and by a fleet of galleys on the lake, and in due time they took it. They let all the prisoners which they found confined there go free, and since then they have used the castle as a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> for arms and ammunition.|$|E

40|$|The {{main results}} of the review of {{existing}} methods, methods, equipment for grinding, distribution of coarse forages, including rolled feed, on cattle–breeding farms are given in the article. This allows us to identify the main factors affecting the productivity of grinders — distributors {{and the quality of}} supply of finished material to feeders. On the basis of research works and analysis of existing technical means for the preparation and distribution of coarse forages, we propose a constructive technological scheme for a mobile shredder–distributor with a longitudinal arrangement of a knife–type working organ. Analysis of mobile shredders and distributors revealed that they should provide loading in the <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> coarse forages, transportation, grinding and dispensing in the feeding zone. The technical tool that performs the totality of the above operations is a dynamic system that operates under conditions of changing external influences. The model of the shredder–distributor functioning is proposed, which can be calculated with incoming variables that determine the conditions of its operation: feeding feed roll, which can be changed if necessary, as well as the physical and mechanical properties of the material, mainly density and humidity, which are uncontrollable factors and are monitored in advance experiments...|$|R
5000|$|Provenance (from the French provenir, [...] "to come from"), is the {{chronology}} of the ownership, custody or {{location of a}} historical object. The term was originally mostly used in relation to works of art, but is now used in similar senses {{in a wide range}} of fields, including archaeology, paleontology, archives, manuscripts, printed books, and science and computing. The primary purpose of tracing the provenance of an object or entity is normally to provide contextual and circumstantial evidence for its original production or discovery, by establishing, as far as practicable, its later history, especially the sequences of its formal ownership, custody, and <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage.</b> The practice has a particular value in helping authenticate objects. Comparative techniques, expert opinions, and the results of scientific tests may also be used to these ends, but establishing provenance is essentially a matter of documentation.|$|R

40|$|In the {{conditions}} of globalization and the world economic communications, the role of information support of business processes increases in various branches and fields of activity. There is not an exception for the warehouse activity. Such information support is realized in warehouse logistic systems. In relation to territorial administratively education, the warehouse logistic system gets a format of difficult social and economic structure which controls the economic streams covering the intermediary, trade and transport organizations and the enterprises of other branches and spheres. Spatial movement of inventory items makes new demands to participants of merchandising. Warehousing (in the meaning – storage) – {{is one of the}} operations entering into logistic activity, on the organization of a material stream, as a requirement. Therefore, warehousing as "management of spatial movement of stocks" – is justified.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Poor <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> {{medicines}} {{can reduce}} their efficacy, yet {{little is known}} about how people store medicines in their homes and elsewhere, why these locations are chosen, and whether the conditions are suitable for medicines storage. AIM: To investigate where medicines are commonly stored in New Zealand households, why, and the typical conditions-temperature and relative humidity-in those <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage.</b> METHODS: Data from a large qualitative study on the meanings of medicines were analysed to explore where people store medicines in their households, and why. A data logger was used to log temperature and relative humidity in common medicine storage places, such as homes and cars. RESULTS: Kitchens and bathrooms were the most commonly reported storage places, with people influenced by convenience, desire to remember to take medicines, and child safety when deciding where to store medicines. High temperatures and humidity were found in kitchens and bathrooms, extreme temperatures in a car and a backpack, and extremely low temperatures in checked-in luggage on a plane. DISCUSSION: Temperature- and humidity-sensitive medicines should not be stored long-term in common storage locations, such as kitchens and bathrooms. Conditions in these places may not comply with the recommended storage conditions given by the manufacturer. Furthermore, medicines should not be left in backpacks or cars, especially if the vehicle is in the sun. Medicines that may degrade upon freezing and thawing - such as protein-containing medicines, emulsions, suspensions and some solutions - should not be stored in the cargo hold of a plane...|$|R
50|$|After Mother Seton’s {{departure}} to Emmitsburg, Maryland in {{the summer}} of 1809, the house was left vacant for some time. This property served for a variety of purposes; in the late 19th century and early 20th century the home was used as a potato bin, and a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> and laundry services. After receiving much negative attention for its lack of upkeep, a local women’s group initiated the restoration of the home. The current owner of the property is the Sulpician Order, which also still retains control of St. Mary’s Seminary. In the process of renovation, the house was thoroughly documented by taking photos of both the interior and exterior in order to restore the home to its full originality. At the head of renovation were Mrs. Earnshaw and Mrs. Clinton K. Macsherry with their consultant, John H. Scarff. They furnished the home with decor from the Federal time period. During this time, many were behind the full restoration of this home; in particular, it can be noted that the Order of the Alhambra gave $20,000 for the project.|$|E
50|$|Once CO2 is {{captured}} from a gas or coal-fired power plant, {{it would be}} compressed to ≈100 bar {{so that it would}} be a supercritical fluid. In this fluid form, the CO2 would be easy to transport via pipeline to the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage.</b> The CO2 would then be injected deep underground, typically around 1 km, where it would be stable for hundreds to millions of years. At these storage conditions, the density of supercritical CO2 is 600 to 800 kg / m3. For consumers, the cost of electricity from a coal-fired power plant with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is estimated to be 0.01 - 0.05 $ / kWh higher than without CCS. For reference, the average cost of electricity in the US in 2004 was 0.0762 $ / kWh. In other terms, the cost of CCS would be 20 - 70 $/ton of CO2 captured. The transportation and injection of CO2 is relatively cheap, with the capture costs accounting for 70 - 80% of CCS costs.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the dockyard, Martin Bowes who had gathered a fortune at the Royal Mint, bought riverside holdings in Woolwich and Plumstead in the 1530s, some of it former church land that had become available after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. His mansion was Tower Place, which was gradually closed in by a ropeyard (1570s) and warehouses with open-air storage known initially as Gun Wharf or Gun Yard, then The Warren (1651/71), later the Royal Arsenal (1805). The arsenal developed from a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> into a collection of military factories (Royal Ordnance Factories), playing a central role in Britain's imperial phase and its military and industrial expansion. At wartime, tens of thousands of workers found employment here. Between wars, unemployment loomed. Other military establishments that were rooted in the arsenal were the Royal Artillery (1716) and the Royal Military Academy (1741). They both moved to Woolwich Common in the late 18th century. In the 19th and 20th century several large barracks were built, as well as military schools and hospitals. To this day, the town retains an army base at the Royal Artillery Barracks and Napier Lines Barracks.|$|E

They rigged up makeshift ramps from oars and spars down which they slid the boats onto the Boat Deck. Unfortunately for all concerned, the boat broke through the ramp and landed upside-down on the deck. It reached the Boat Deck upside-down but there was no time to right it as Titanic began her final break-up and plunge to the seabed. Water swept across the Boat Deck, washing the upside-down lifeboat and many people into the sea. Wireless operator Harold Bride found himself trapped underneath the overturned hull. Titanics increasing angle in the water and an opening expansion joint caused the stays supporting the forward funnel to snap and crash into the water, crushing swimmers in its path and pushing Collapsible B away from the sinking ship. As Titanic went under, the lifeboat was left in the midst of hundreds of people swimming in the water. Several dozen people climbed onto its hull, including Lightoller, who then took charge of it. Also aboard were Jack Thayer (whose mother was saved with her maid in Boat #4, but whose father died), military historian Colonel Archibald Gracie, who later wrote a popular account of the disaster, and Chief Baker Charles Joughin. Bride managed to escape from the air pocket beneath the boat and made it onto the hull.|$|R

In the second part, there is the drafted plan of the mass extemporaneous decontamination of people in the selected public facility, according to the general methods of decontamination. Next, there is the drafted documentation for resolving an extraordinary event: an accident with subsequent leakage of a dangerous chemical substance, resulting in the need to carry out the mass decontamination of people in selected public facilities. In the last part, I have discussed and compared the advantages and possible disadvantages of the selected object of for the implementation of mass decontamination of people. There is also a suggested way of how to carry out this decontamination in this object in the most efficient way. The processing of this documentation has clearly confirmed my hypothesis. The mass decontamination of people in the selected location, in this case specifically in the Domazlice Hostel and Swimming Pool, can be feasibly performed with an improvised method.
