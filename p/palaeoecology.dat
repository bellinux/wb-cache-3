They grew in columns, with an observed maximum of six in each, {{and the number of}} columns varied based on the animal's size. Known column counts for the two species are: 51 to 53columns per maxilla and 48 to 49 per dentary (teeth of the upper jaw being slightly narrower than those in the lower jaw) for E. regalis; and 52columns per maxilla and 44 per dentary for E. annectens (an E. saskatchewanensis specimen).|$|E
