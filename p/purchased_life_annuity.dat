40|$|The special tax {{treatment}} of UK pensions {{means that the}} decision {{on how to use}} pensions assets is more involved than in other tax jurisdictions. In particular, the ability to take up to 25 % of pensions assets as a tax-free cash lump sum at retirement offers retirees opportunities to enhance their pension above that possible through the purchase of a compulsory purchase annuity (“CPA”). The tax-free cash lump sum can be used to buy a tax-efficient <b>purchased</b> <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> (“PLA”), or in a phased retirement strategy. Income withdrawal {{can also be used to}} defer the purchase of an annuity until age 75 and, potentially, to generate a higher income. In this paper I compare the options available to retirees using stochastic modelling. I compare the expected excess pension and expected shortfall, both relative to the alternative riskfree pension available, to assess the various options. I find that if the maximum amount of tax-free cash is available to be used to enhance retirement income, then phased retirement offers the best risk/reward trade off. The advantage is greatest for higher-rate tax payers. As the level of tax-free cash falls, income withdrawal becomes more attractive to those wishing to take greater risks. 1...|$|E

Indeed, various restrictive institutional factors tend to strengthen the natural propensity of individuals to favour liquid and transferable assets. Although long term savings benefit from an attractive taxation, it is generally not fiscally advantageous to annuitize the accumulated wealth.

40|$|One of {{the most}} puzzling {{contrasts}} between observed behavior {{and the implications of}} standard economic theory is the fact that, at least in the United States, few elderly individuals <b>purchase</b> <b>life</b> <b>annuities.</b> The conventional life-cycle model, based on the appealing concept that people save so as to smooth their consumption over their lifetimes, suggests that elderly retired individuals would seek to dissave out of their available resources as their remaining life expectancy shortens.

Given the uncertainty associated with any individual’s life ex-pectancy, this reluctance to dissave would be a natural consequence of risk aversion if individuals could not avoid that risk by buying an-nuities.

40|$|The {{observed}} {{reluctance of}} most {{individuals in the}} United States to buy individual <b>life</b> <b>annuities,</b> and the concomitant approximately flat average age-wealth profile, stand in sharp contradiction to the standard life cycle model of consumption-saving behavior. The analysis in this paper lends support to an explanation for this phenomenon based on the interaction of an intentional bequest motive and annuity prices that are not actuarially fair. Premiums charged for individual <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> in the United States include a load factor of 32 - 48 c per dollar,or 18 - 33 c per dollar after allowing for adverse selection, in comparison to actuarially fair annuity values. Load factors of this size are not {{out of line with}} those on other familiar (and almost universally purchased) insurance products. Simulations of an extended model of life cycle saving and portfolio behavior, allowing explicitly for uncertain lifetimes and Social Security, show that the load factor charged would have to be far larger than this to account for the observed behavior {{in the absence of a}} bequest motive. By contrast, the combination of a load factor in this range and a positive bequest motive can do so for some plausible values of the assumed underlying parameters. Moreover,if this combination of factors is leading elderly individuals to avoid <b>purchasing</b> <b>life</b> <b>annuities,</b> it implies a typical bequest that is fairly large in comparison to their consumption. ...|$|R

As this problem doesn’t accept any suitable explicit solution, it is numerically solved by the Markov Chain approximation developed by Kushner and Dupuis.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the optimal continuous time dynamic consumption and portfolio choice for pooled annuity funds. A pooled annuity fund constitutes an alternative {{way to protect}} against mortality risk compared to <b>purchasing</b> a <b>life</b> <b>annuity.</b> The crucial difference between the pooled annuity fund and <b>purchase</b> of a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> offered by an insurance company is that participants of a pooled annuity fund still have to bear some mortality risk while insured annuitants bear no mortality risk at all. The population of the pool is modeled by employing a Poisson process with time-dependent hazard-rate. It follows that the pool member’s optimization problem has {{to account for the}} stochastic investment horizon and for jumps in wealth which occur if another pool member dies. In case the number of pool members goes to infinity analytical solutions are provided. For finite pool sizes the solution of the optimization problem is reduced to the numerical solution of a set of ODEs. A simulation and welfare analysis show that pooled annuity funds insure very effectively against longevity risk even if their pool size is rather small.

While full annuitization would still be optimal if annuity markets were truly complete and both life- and health-contingent, lacking this, annuity equivalent wealth values are much lower for those in poor health, as compared to persons in good health. ...|$|R

40|$|Different {{countries}} around the world have experienced and improvement in mortality over the years. This improvement can be attributed to factors such as technological advancements in the medical field and improved living standards among others. This is generally a good thing, but for life insurance companies and defined benefit pension schemes that provide benefits in form of annuities, there lies the risk of longevity. Which is the risk that people will live longer than expected requiring them to be paid benefits for longer periods. This paper studies the implication of changes in Kenyan mortality on the value of an annuity. It focuses on the mortality of the annuitants in Kenya. These are people who have <b>purchased</b> <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> from Kenyan insurance companies. Exponential extrapolative methods are used to obtain reduction factors that are later used to extrapolate mortality from the year 2011 - 2050. An annuity of Ksh. 1 is then priced over the extrapolated period for each age range for all years, in order to determine how an annuity changes over the years. From the analysis, the Kenyan mortality has been reducing. This has an inverse effect on the value of annuities as the annuity prices are observed to increase with an increase in mortality over the years. This therefore exposes the Kenyan insurance companies to longevity risk...|$|R

It then considers the value that married couples would place on access to an actuarially fair annuity market, and defines a measure of willingness-to-pay for annuities. This calculation differs from the analogous one for a single individual for two reasons. First, joint-and-survivor life tables differ from individual life tables. The life expectancy of the second-to-die in a married couple is substantially greater than that for a single individual. Second, joint <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> provide time-varying payouts, because survivor benefit options permit the payout when both members of a couple are alive to differ from that when one member has died. The paper develops a new annuity valuation model and applies it to evaluate a married couple's utility gain from annuitization.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal annuitization, investment and consumption strategies of a utility-maximizing retiree facing a stochastic {{time of death}} {{under a variety of}} institutional restrictions. We focus on the impact of aging on the optimal <b>purchase</b> of <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> which form the basis of most Defined Benefit pension plans. Due to adverse selection, acquiring a lifetime payout annuity is an irreversible transaction that creates an incentive to delay. Under the institutional all-or-nothing arrangement where annuitization must take place at one distinct point in time (i. e. retirement), we derive the optimal age at which to annuitize and develop a metric to capture the loss from annuitizing prematurely. In contrast, under an open-market structure where individuals can annuitize any fraction of their wealth at anytime, we locate a general optimal annuity purchasing policy. In this case, we find that an individual will initially annuitize a lump sum and then buy annuities to keep wealth to one side of a separating ray in wealth-annuity space.

40|$|To {{a worker}} contemplating retirement, there is perhaps no more {{important}} question than “How long will my money last?” Congress {{has a strong}} interest in the income security of older Americans because much of their income is either provided directly from public programs like Social Security, {{or in the case of}} pensions and retirement accounts, is subsidized through tax deductions and deferrals. Many retirees must decide how to convert retirement account balances into income and how to preserve the accounts in the face of several kinds of risk. * Longevity risk is the risk that the individual will exhaust his or her account before death and experience a substantial decline in income. * Investment risk is the risk that the assets in which the individual has invested his or her retirement account will decline in value. * Inflation risk is the risk that price increases will cause the individual’s retirement income to decline in purchasing power. * Unexpected events such as divorce, the death of a spouse, the cost of medical care, or a need for long-term care services are also risks. There are strategies for dealing with each of these risks, but no single strategy can deal effectively with all of them. For example, <b>purchasing</b> a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> insures against longevity risk and it shifts the investment risk to the insurer. However, purchasing an annuity depletes the purchaser’s available assets by the amount of the premium. These assets are no longer available to the retiree in the event of a catastrophic illness or other unexpected major expense. To date, the demand for annuities has been low. There are many reasons for the low demand for annuities, but one of the most important has been that many potential annuity purchasers do not value the longevity insurance provided by annuities at its market price. Retirees who choose not to <b>purchase</b> <b>life</b> <b>annuities</b> must decide how much to withdraw from their retirement accounts each year. Because they face uncertainty with respect to both life expectancy and the rate of return on investment, this decision carries its own risks. If withdrawals are too large, retirees risk spending down their savings too quickly, possibly leaving them impoverished. If withdrawals are too small, they might spend too little and leave substantial assets unspent when they die. An analysis conducted by CRS indicates that under specific conditions there is a 95 % or greater probability that a man who retires at age 65 will not exhaust his retirement account before the earlier of death or age 95 if his initial withdrawal does not exceed 5 % of the account balance and later withdrawals are the same in inflationadjusted dollars. Under the same conditions, there is a 95 % or greater probability that a woman who retires at age 65 will not exhaust her retirement account before the earlier of death or age 95 if her initial withdrawal does not exceed 4. 5 % of the account balance and later withdrawals are the same in inflation-adjusted dollars...|$|R

Ruin occurs when the total {{of the value of}} the risky and riskless assets and the surrender value of the <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> reaches zero. We find the optimal investment strategy and optimal annuity purchase and surrender strategies in two situations: (i) the value of the risky and riskless assets is allowed to be negative, with the imputed surrender value of the <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> keeping the total positive; or (ii) the value of the risky and riskless assets is required to be non-negative. In the first case, although the individual has the flexiblity to buy or sell at any time, we find that the individual will not buy a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> unless she can cover all her consumption via the annuity and she will never sell her annuity. In the second case, the individual surrenders just enough annuity income to keep her total assets positive. However, in this second case, the individual’s annuity purchasing strategy depends on the size of the proportional surrender charge. When the charge is large enough, the individual will not buy a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> unless she can cover all her consumption, the so-called safe level.

It draws heavily on data collected by the Health and Retirement Study and calculates the "potential additional annuity income" that households could purchase, given their holdings of non-annuitized financial assets {{at the start of}} retirement. Even if households used all of their financial assets inside and outside personal retirement accounts to <b>purchase</b> a <b>life</b> <b>annuity,</b> only 47 percent of households between the ages of 65 and 69 in 2008 could increase their life-contingent income by more than $ 5, 000 per year.

The paper also considers the role of housing equity in the portfolios of retirement-age households, and explores the extent to which households draw down housing equity and financial assets as they age. Many households appear to treat housing equity and non-annuitized financial assets as “precautionary savings,” tending to draw them down only when they experience a shock such as the death of a spouse or a period of substantial medical outlays. Because home equity is often conserved until very late in life, for many households it may provide some insurance against the risk of living longer than expected. ...|$|R

Our model pre-supposes a retiree who does not currently have sufficient wealth to <b>purchase</b> a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> that will yield her exogenously desired fixed consumption level. She seeks the asset allocation and annuitization strategy that will minimize the probability of lifetime ruin. We demonstrate that because of the binary nature of the investor’s goal, she will not annuitize any of her wealth until she can fully cover her desired consumption with a <b>life</b> <b>annuity.</b> We derive a variational inequality that governs the ruin probability and the optimal strategies, and we demonstrate that the problem can be recast as a related optimal stopping problem which yields a free-boundary prob-lem that is more tractable. We numerically calculate the ruin probability and optimal strategies and examine how they change as we vary the mortality assumption and pa-rameters of the financial model. Moreover, for the special case of exponential future lifetime, we solve the (dual) problem explicitly. As a byproduct of our calculations, we are able to quantify the reduction in lifetime ruin probability that comes from being able to manage the investment portfolio dynamically and purchase annuities...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{properties}} of several insurance products via the methods of stochastic analysis and stochastic control. This dissertation consists of the following three parts: 1. We find the minimum probability of lifetime ruin of an investor who can invest in a market with a risky and a riskless asset and who can <b>purchase</b> a reversible <b>life</b> <b>annuity.</b> The surrender charge of a <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> is a proportion of its value. Ruin occurs when the total {{of the value of}} the risky and riskless assets and the surrender value of the <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> reaches zero. We find the optimal investment strategy and optimal annuity purchase and surrender strategies in two situations: (i) the value of the risky and riskless assets is allowed to be negative, with the imputed surrender value of the <b>life</b> <b>annuity</b> keeping the total positive; or (ii) the value of the risky and riskless assets is required to be non-negative. 2. We model a retiree as a utility-maximizing economic agent who can invest in a financial market with a risky and a riskless asset and who can purchase or surrender reversible annuities. We define the wealth of an individual as the total value of her risky and riskless assets, which is required to be non-negative during her lifetime. We solve this incomplete market utility maximization problem via duality arguments and obtain semi-analytical solutions. 3. We develop a theory for pricing pure endowments when hedging with a mortality forward is allowed. The hazard rate associated with the pure endowment and the reference hazard rate for the mortality forward are correlated and are modeled by diffusion processes. We price the pure endowment by assuming that the issuing company hedges its contract with the mortality forward and requires compensation for the unhedgeable part of the mortality risk in the form of a pre-specified instantaneous Sharpe ratio. We identify {{the properties of}} the prices of pure endowments and the factors that affect hedging efficiency...|$|R
