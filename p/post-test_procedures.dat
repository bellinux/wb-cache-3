40|$|The Effects of an Injury Prevention Program in an Aquatic Environment on Landing Technique Samantha E. Scarneo, University of Connecticut Context: Musculoskeletal and {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries have accounted {{for a majority of}} sports and recreational related injuries and are of major concern to the physically active population. Injury prevention programs (IPP) have proven to improve landing technique, decreasing vertical ground reaction forces (VGRF) resulting in injury risk reduction. Injury prevention programs in an aquatic-based environment may potentially elicit the same improvements as land-based programs. Objective: To examine the effects of a six week aquatic-based IPP on Landing Error Scoring System scores and VGRF. Design and Setting: All participants completed an aquatic-based IPP three times a week for six weeks in the pool. Participants: Participants were females, 163 centimeters or taller, able to swim, no LE injuries, and were screened to have poor landing technique (LESS-RT of 4 or more). Main Outcome Measures: Pre- and Post- test procedures including measuring landing technique was measured using the Landing Error Scoring System and VGRF. Pre-test procedures were completed prior to program implementation. <b>Post-test</b> <b>procedures</b> were completed following completion of the program. Participants also completed an open-ended questionnaire to obtain qualitative date pertaining to factors to facilitate adherence and compliance.

40|$|Background : Physical {{educators}} {{are faced with}} trying to provide motivating and enjoyable experiences in physical education. Sport Education is an instructional model that aims to provide positive motivational sport experiences by simulating the features of authentic sport. Research support for Sport Education is positive, however, the effects on student motivation and the motivational climate are not well understood. Purpose : To investigate {{the influence of the}} Sport Education model on student motivation (intrinsic/extrinsic motivation, goal orientations, and perceived motivational climate) in secondary physical education. Setting : Six classes were selected according to teacher and class availability in the sports of soccer, hockey, and football codes in a co-educational government school. Participants : Participants were 115 (male = 97, female = 18) Year- 8 students (aged 13 - 14 years), in a Sport Education condition (n = 41) and a Traditional condition (n = 74). Measures : At pre- and post-test, all participants completed three questionnaires: the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, the Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire, and the Perceived Motivational Climate in Sport Questionnaire. Intervention : Participants completed either a Sport Education condition or a Traditional condition for one double period (100 minutes) one day per week for 10 weeks (Sport Education condition) or for five weeks (Traditional condition). The Sport Education condition incorporated six distinctive features: seasons, affiliation, formal competition, record keeping, festivity, and a culminating event. The Traditional condition used whole-group instruction led by the teacher. Research design : The study used a non-equivalent control group design with pre- and <b>post-test</b> <b>procedures.</b> The independent variable was teaching condition and the dependent variable was student motivation (assessed by intrinsic motivation, goal orientations, and motivational climate). The groups were already established and selected for convenience purposes. Data collection and analysis : Participants completed pre-test measures and then participated in their pre-established classes. Post-test measures were completed in the last class in each condition. A reliability analysis on measures was conducted using Cronach 2 ̆ 7 s alphas. A pre-test manipulation check was performed to check for any initial differences in motivation. To compare the difference in changes between conditions on motivation, a series of 2 times 2 repeated measures analyses of variance were conducted. A comparison of the relationship between motivation measures was conducted using Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s product moment correlation coefficients. Findings : There was {{a significant difference between the}} conditions on changes in perceived competence, task orientation, and mastery climate, with the Traditional condition decreasing significantly from pre- to post-test compared with the Sport Education condition. There were no significant differences on interest/enjoyment, effort/importance, pressure/tension, ego orientation, or performance climate. A mastery climate was positively related to task orientation and intrinsic motivation and a performance climate was related to ego orientation. Conclusions : The Sport Education condition was more successful in maintaining high levels of intrinsic motivation, task orientation, and mastery climate than the Traditional condition. That is, the Traditional condition was associated with a decrease in adaptive aspects of motivation for students, whereas the Sport Education condition maintained existing levels of motivation. <br /...|$|E

The whole procedure was videotaped. To obtain the quantitative data, frequencies of the children's sharing behaviour were coded within the categories of Share Offer, Share Request, Acceptance, and Refusal, from the videotaped. To obtain the qualitative data, the children's categorised sharing behaviours were described by the Movement Behavioural Checklist based on Laban Movement Analysis. The quantitative data was analysed by the Kruskal-Wallis One-Way Analysis of Variance. The {{results indicated that the}} Active Puppetry Involvement method was more statistically significant than the Passive Puppetry Involvement method in decreasing the frequency of children's Refusal behaviours. However, the former was not more statistically significant than the latter in increasing Share Offers and Acceptances, and in decreasing Share Requests. The qualitative data enriched the data by describing children's actual sharing behaviours. It showed that children's sharing behaviours were mainly based on their bodily usage with some verbalism through their use of eye contact and body weight shifts, with mainly flow and space factoral usages in their energy expressions, with personal, general, or interpersonal spatial usage, with open or closed body attitudes. This study seems to be a first empirical study investigating puppetry's value in educational contexts, particularly in pre-schools through a Pre-test, Treatment, and <b>Post-test</b> <b>procedure.</b> Furthermore, by combining both quantitative and qualitative data approaches, this study enriched the data which concerns children's behavioural changes through sharing. Therefore, this study led puppetry's educational usage by an empirical study which combines two aspects of data analysis. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. The {{focus of}} the study is on the effect of massage on an infant's stress level, {{development}} and the emotional bond between the infant and the mother. Eight mother-infants dyads were recruited and the infants were between the ages of 3 to 9 months. The dyads were paired to ensure similarity of the groups and divided into an experimental and control group. The research made use of a multi-method, pre and post-test design. The measures used during the pre and post-testing included a biographical questionnaire, the Griffiths Mental Development Scales, the Parenting Stress Index and the Mother-to-lnfant Bonding Scale. Personal interviews were conducted with each mother as part of the <b>post-test</b> <b>procedures.</b> Saliva samples from every mother and infant were retrieved on three separate occasions to determine cortisol levels before, during and after the intervention. The experimental group's mothers received training to perform infant massage and were requested to massage their infants at least four times a week for the duration of four months. The data was processed by the Statistical Consultation Service of the Northwest University at Potchefstroom. The non-parametric test, Mann-Whitney U Test, was used to determine any statistical and/or practical significant differences between the experimental and control group before and after implementation of the intervention. The non-parametric test, Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed Rank T-Test, was used to determine the differences within both the experimental and control group. Friedman's ANOVA was used to determine the changes within the groups regarding cortisol levels. As the sample size for this study is small and the possibility of determining statistical significance was slight, the effect sizes were considered for this study. The study had six aims. The first aim focused on the effect of infant massage on the infants' stress levels as measured through cortisol. No statistical significance could be found and the results revealed that the experimental group's infants' stress levels did not decrease. The second aim investigated the effect of infant massage on the mothers' stress levels as measured on the Parenting Stress Index and cortisol levels. No statistical significance could be determined but practical significant differences on the Parenting Stress Index indicated decreased maternal stress levels in the experimental group. These results differ from the cortisol levels that revealed the experimental group's mothers to experience higher levels of stress. The third aim focused on the effect of infant massage on the bond between mother and infant and found that the bond improved due to the intervention. The fourth aim investigated the effect of massage on the infants' development and although no statistical significance could be determined, practical significance could be found, indicating improvements on the motor scales for the experimental group. The fifth aim explored the mothers' subjective experience of infant massage as reported through qualitative measures. The sixth aim compared the mothers as participants' experience of infant massage as reported through quantitative measures and through qualitative measures. Strengths of the study included making use of a multi-method design and following a multi-disciplinary approach. Limitations of the study included a small sample size, the participants' restricted background and difficulty to ensure that the participants comply with the instructions for sampling saliva. Based on the results from the study, it can be concluded that infant massage {{have an effect on the}} mother-infant relationship, the mothers' subjective view of their stress levels and specified areas of the infants' development. According to the results from this study infant massage did not have an effect on the infants and mothers' stress levels as measured through cortisol. Master...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{evaluated}} temporal {{trends and}} geographic variation in choice of stress testing modality after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), {{as well as}} associations between modality and procedure use after testing. BackgroundStress testing is frequently performed post-PCI, but the choices among available modalities (electrocardiography only, nuclear, or echocardiography; pharmacological or exercise stress) and consequences of such choices are not well characterized. MethodsCathPCI Registry® data were linked with identifiable Medicare claims to capture stress testing use between 60 and 365 days post-PCI and procedures within 90 days after testing. Testing rates and modality used were modeled {{on the basis of}} patient, procedure, and PCI facility factors, calendar quarter, and Census Divisions using Poisson and logistic regression. <b>Post-test</b> <b>procedure</b> use was assessed using Gray's test. ResultsAmong 284, 971 patients, the overall stress testing rate after PCI was 53. 1 per 100 person-years. Testing rates declined from 59. 3 in quarter 1 (2006) to 47. 1 in quarter 4 (2008), but the relative use of modalities changed little. Among exercise testing recipients, adjusted proportions receiving electrocardiography-only testing varied from 6. 8 % to 22. 8 % across Census Divisions; and among exercise testing recipients having an imaging test, the proportion receiving echocardiography (versus nuclear) varied from 9. 4 % to 34. 1 %. <b>Post-test</b> <b>procedure</b> use varied among modalities; exercise electrocardiography-only testing was associated with more subsequent stress testing (13. 7 % vs. 2. 9 %; p < 0. 001), but less catheterization (7. 4 % vs. 14. 1 %; p < 0. 001) than imaging-based tests. ConclusionsModest reductions in stress testing after PCI occurring between 2006 and 2008 cannot be ascribed to trends in use of any single modality. Additional research should assess whether this trend represents better patient selection for testing or administrative policies (e. g., restricted access for patients with legitimate testing needs). Geographic variation in utilization of stress modalities and differences in downstream procedure use among modalities suggest a need to identify optimal use of the different test modalities in individual patients...|$|R

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study is to find out if {{incidental}} learning of words from context takes place as a result of minimum exposure through reading for pleasure. In this study, the experimental design incorporating the pre-and <b>post-test</b> <b>procedure</b> was employed. Convenient sampling was used to select the subjects of this study. The 16 subjects in this study are from the intermediate English course (BZ 1032) of UUM. Only those with B+ and B grades in their BZ 1022 course were selected because these grades seem to safely represent language proficiency at the intermediate level. The post-test results of the experimental group, as indicated by the descriptive statistics and the Mann-Whitney U Test, were superior to the results obtained by the control group. The subject who participated in the reading activity seemed to have learn the meanings of more words compared to those who did not. The findings of this study suggest that a reading for pleasure activity should be incorporated in the curriculum at institutions of higher learning to promote incidental vocabulary learning among students.

40|$|International audiencePersonal agency {{within the}} area of {{learning}} may be construed as a process wherein learning objectives are achieved through volitional direction and tacit involvement in learning. Within the present study, perceived agency {{is the degree to}} which learners believe that the efforts they are putting into the language-learning process is sufficient with respect to the learning objective. Some learners assume that attending classes assiduously generates an entitlement to pass the course, thereby believing that the learning goal has been achieved. In other words, their perc eption is that they have displayed a high degree of agency in spite of what may sometimes prove to be a very low degree of personal involvement. Behaviours of this type are observed regularly among French learners of English in university language courses. This article reports on a study that investigated agency and motivation among second language university learners in a large research university in eastern France. The learners (n= 134) were attending mandatory language classes that form a part of their academic curriculum and were majoring in either engineering, architecture or digital landscape design. The instruments used for data-collection were (i) a questionnaire (the Behaviour Identification Form) (ii) a pre-test / <b>post-test</b> <b>procedure</b> and (iii), as a second source of insight, a candid appraisal, by an independent examiner, of work produced by the learners. Findings suggest that goal achievement, as expressed by quality of work produced and scores attained on the post-test, tend to be a function of whether or not the learners were supervised rather than a result of inherent agency or motivation...|$|R

This study assessed physicians' knowledge, attitude and perception of their role towards testing for hereditary breast-ovarian cancer. Design: A mail-in survey was sent to all general practitioners, internists, obstetrician-gynecologists and oncologists in private practice in Geneva county, Switzerland. Questions included socio-demographic variables, knowledge about hereditary breast-ovarian cancer, attitude towards testing and assessment of their role in the pre- and <b>post-test</b> <b>procedure.</b> Results: Two hundred fifty-nine (65 %) of four hundred questionnaires were returned of which two hundred forty-three (61 %) were analysed. Response rates were similar between specialties; women answered more frequently. The majority of the respondents (87 %) approved of genetic susceptibility testing. The most common objection to testing was the absence of approved strategies for the prevention and detection of early breast cancer. Most physicians felt they had an active part to play in the pre-test procedure, the disclosure of results, and especially the consultants' long-term care and support (99 %). Physicians correctly answered a third (32 %) of the knowledge questions. The abstention rate for individual items ranged from 13 % to 60 %. Scores varied by specialty. Oncologists were more knowledgeable than gynecologists, internists and general practitioners. Conclusions: The majority of the primary care physicians in this study have a favourable attitude and are ready to play a prominent role in genetic counseling and testing for breast-ovarian cancer predisposition.

40|$|Tall {{buildings}} are wind-sensitive structures and could experience high wind-induced effects. Aerodynamic boundary layer wind tunnel testing {{has been the}} most commonly used method for estimating wind effects on tall buildings. Design wind effects on tall {{buildings are}} estimated through analytical processing of the data obtained from aerodynamic wind tunnel tests. Even though it is widely agreed that the data obtained from wind tunnel testing is fairly reliable the <b>post-test</b> analytical <b>procedures</b> are still argued to have remarkable uncertainties. This research work attempted to assess the uncertainties occurring at different stages of the <b>post-test</b> analytical <b>procedures</b> in detail and suggest improved techniques for reducing the uncertainties. ^ Results of the study showed that traditionally used simplifying approximations, particularly in the frequency domain approach, could cause significant uncertainties in estimating aerodynamic wind-induced responses. Based on identified shortcomings, a more accurate dual aerodynamic data analysis framework which works in the frequency and time domains was developed. The comprehensive analysis framework allows estimating modal, resultant and peak values of various wind-induced responses of a tall building more accurately. ^ Estimating design wind effects on tall buildings also requires synthesizing the wind tunnel data with local climatological data of the study site. A novel copula based approach was developed for accurately synthesizing aerodynamic and climatological data up on investigating the causes of significant uncertainties in currently used synthesizing techniques. Improvement of the new approach over the existing techniques was also illustrated with a case study on a 50 story building. ^ At last, a practical dynamic optimization approach was suggested for tuning structural properties of tall buildings towards attaining optimum performance against wind loads with less number of design iterations. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the level of understanding of Euclidian geometry, in terms of theoretical knowledge {{as well as its}} problem-solving application, in pre-service mathematics education (PME) students at the University of Pretoria. In order to do so, a one group pre-test/ <b>post-test</b> <b>procedure</b> was conducted around an intensive geometry module, and a representational group of students was interviewed before and after the module to discuss their high school experiences of learning geometry and to analyse their attitudes towards the subject. The van Hiele Theory of Levels of Thought in Geometry was used as the theoretical framework for this study. The PME students in this study, prior to their completion of the geometry module, lacked the content knowledge, skills and insight in Euclidian geometry that is expected at matric level (Level 3). The pre-test results revealed that half the group could only be classified as being on Level 0. By the time the post-test was written, 60 % of the group had moved onto Level 1 as their maximum competence level. This implies that these students were all brought to greater insight by the teaching they received during the geometry module. However, the overall improvement in the group as revealed in the post-test results, consisted of an upward movement of only one level. Therefore, the geometry module offered did not bring about sufficient improvement for these students to be able to teach geometry adequately (Level 3 is required). The students who were interviewed for this study uniformly expressed their dislike or fear of Euclidian geometry in general, but described the positive change in their attitude {{during the course of the}} module because of the way it was presented. Training of students for a career as mathematics educators which includes an in-depth van Hiele-based geometry module would facilitate the acquisition of insight and relational understanding.

40|$|BACKGROUND: While {{the value}} of the single blood sample (SBS) method for {{estimating}} Cr-EDTA plasma clearance has been repeatedly demonstrated, some nuclear medicine physicians are still reluctant to use it {{because of the lack of}} quality control parameters. PURPOSE: To present a <b>post-test</b> quality control <b>procedure</b> for the SBS technique in children. METHODS: In addition to the SBS clearance calculated using the specific paediatric SBS method, three artificial slope intercept (ASI) method clearances were calculated by assuming the distribution volume as, respectively, 20 %, 25 % and 30 % of body weight. By dividing the injected activity by the distributional volume, the initial plasma concentrations (A 0, 30 %, A 0, 25 % and A 0, 20 %) were calculated. Using these A 0 values and the available single sample, ASI clearances were calculated by using the classical slope-intercept method. The working hypothesis of this approach was as follows. In the absence of significant errors, the three ASI clearance values should be close to that of the SBS method. This hypothesis has been tested using both simulated and patients' data. RESULTS: The results of the simulated study showed that an error in the injected dose produced variable differences between SBS and ASI clearances depending on the clearance values. The effect of an error on the plasma sample also varied as a function of the clearance values. The analysis of patient data revealed that the ASI approach allowed the identification of patients in whom the classical slope-intercept method suggested the presence of a possible error. CONCLUSION: A <b>post-test</b> quality control <b>procedure</b> for the SBS GFR measurement is presented. When the SBS clearance shows a difference with the ASI method (> 10 ml·min per 1. 73 m), the presence of an error is highly probable. A smaller difference, however, does not exclude erroneous data. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Everyday {{communication}} occurs mostly through speech, thus learners {{who have}} little or no functional speech (LNFS) need to augment their communication by using additional communication strategies to ensure that they are able to participate in the interaction process. The use of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) can and should {{play an important role in}} assisting learners with LNFS to access information and services and to communicate. Graphic symbols form an important part of most AAC users’ communication systems. Therefore studies which focus on increasing understanding of the way different graphic symbols are learnt and retained by children and adults, are pivotal for a better understanding of the processes involved in graphic symbol learning. Iconicity and learnability of symbols are two important factors to consider when choosing an appropriate graphic symbol set/system. The purpose of the current study was to determine how accurately typically developing urban, 6 -year-old Afrikaans-speaking children could firstly, identify 16 PCS presented thematically on a commercially available communication overlay, and secondly, recognize these symbols following exposure to a learning experience. Forty-six participants, divided into 2 cohorts, were each presented with 16 copies of a 16 -matrix overlay and required to match a symbol with a spoken Afrikaans label. The participants were then divided into two groups, one group receiving training in the meaning of the symbols and the other group receiving no training. Finally the test-procedure was repeated with the cohorts. The results indicated that the 16 PCS symbols had an iconicity of between 12. 5 % (accuracy score > 50 %) and 25 % (accuracy score > 75 %) for the combined group. Results further indicated a significant improvement in both the experimental and the control groups’ post-test results. The significant difference between the two groups’ post-test results does, however, indicate that the experimental group recognized more symbols during the post-test administration than the control group and they had thus benefited from the training session. The control group’s better post-test results can be attributed to the single exposure through the pre-test procedure. The participants made use of the information afforded them by the postural cues implying motion. They did not, however, make full use of the arrow cues or the direction of the arrows, which also implied motion. Once the participants of the experimental group were made aware of the arrows, they seemed to use the information the arrows offered to help them remember the symbol meanings during the <b>post-test</b> <b>procedure.</b> Copyright 2004, University of Pretoria.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2000. Vygotsky (1978, {{as cited}} in Day, Engelhardt, Maxwell and Bolig, 1997) argued that a {{complete}} profile of intellectual competence must include both static measures of what the child already knows and dynamic measures of the child's ability to benefit from instruction. This study involves an analysis of this contention and has two specific aims: Firstly, to determine whether modified cognition would result from mediation, using three instruments of Feuerstein's Learning Potential Assessment Device in a group administration format, as demonstrated by improved performance in post-mediation testing; and secondly, {{to determine whether the}} group administration of the three instruments from the Feuerstein's Learning Potential Assessment Device will be able to detect differences in the degree of coqnltive modifiability of individuals. The statio assessment paradigm is predominant within the South African education system and is used to categorise and place learners in "appropriate" learning contexts ego special schools, special classes within mainstream and mixed ability groupings. The growing discontent with standardised tests rests mainly with the fact that they only access the manifest level of performance of learners. As such,it is contended that they do a gross injustice to those learners that are educationally-disadvantaged, marginalised and culturally different to the norm groups of the standardised assessments. The dynamic assessment paradigm is presented as an alternative to static assessment because it focuses on learning potential. It regards a learner's manifest level of performance as -a baseline and emphasises the need to mediate within what Vygotsky (1978) calls the learner's zone of proximal development to access his/her potential. The Learning Potential Assessment Device, consisting of a battery of dynamic assessment instruments, was used in the study to ascertain the effects of mediation on performance and to detect differences in the degree of coqnitive modifiability of individuals. This was done using a pretest - mediation - <b>post-test</b> <b>procedure</b> with a comparison of pretest and post-test performances. Through the process of random assignment, the population sample of thirty one grade eight subjects was divided into a control group and an experimental group. The pretest phase of three selected instruments (Numerical Progressions, the Organizer and the Organization of Dots) was administered to the group as a whole. The mediation phase was administered to the experimental group only and thereafter both the control group and the experimental group completed the post-test phase. An analysis of the results revealed that the difference in pretest and post-test mean scores for Numerical Progressions was statistically not significant. An analysis of the mean scotes of the experimental group for the Organizer revealed that the educationally-disadvantaged group benefitted from mediation to a larger extent than the educationally-advantaged group. The pretest and post-test difference in mean scores for the Organization of Dots was statistically significant. An analysis of the post-test scores of individual subjects within the experimental group revealed a significant improvement for some learners, a marginal improvement for others and reduced scores for some in comparison to their pretest scores. A number of postulations are given for the varied effectiveness of the mediation that was provided...|$|R

When the students conduct the talking chips strategy, every student will have an equal opportunity to deliver his or her speaking during discussion. So, there is no student dominate. The subject of this study is the second grade students IPS of MAS Manba’ul Hidayah Kisaran in academic year of 2016 / 2017 that consisted of 25 students. This research is conducted by using classroom action research which done in two cycles created by Kemmis and McTaggart (2000). Each cycle consisted of one meeting contained of teaching material and conducting <b>post-test.</b> The research <b>procedure</b> included plan, action, observation and reflection. Meanwhile, {{the research}}er used quantitative and qualitative data to support this research. The instrument of quantitative data is a test for the students that evaluates by using speaking rubrics reference (J. Michael O’Malley and Pierce L. Vendez: 1996) and the instruments of qualitative data are interview sheet, observation checklist, diary notes, and documentation. The researcher worked collaboratively with the collaborator (researchers’ friend) and the students as the subject. In addition, this research also use a formula to calculate the students’ mean score (= Σ) and the percentage of students who get success and unsuccess in speaking test (P = x 100...|$|R
40|$|In {{the ancient}} {{paradigm}} of learning process, teacher gave students knowledge passively, which was teacher centered. On the other hand, students were {{just waiting for}} the “knowledge transferring” from the teacher. Teacher play as a main source of knowledge who transfer his knowledge like writing in a blank paper. However, in the reality there are still students who do not interest to learn English. They sometimes feel bored in the learning process. It might be caused by the situation and condition of class, the difficult or uninteresting material. It is like that students who do not interest to learn English may get an unsatisfying achievement. In order to solve this problem, it can be done by increasing the activeness of students’ participation. If students are given a chance to be more active, they can acquire knowledge, ideas by themselves. One of the learning method that is predicted to solve the problems is cooperative - STAD (Student Team - Achievement Division). In this method, each student has individual responsibility to master the material by being active during the learning process. Students will be motivated to encourage and help each others to master material presented by teacher. If students want their team to earn rewards, they must help their team to learn the material well. This research was a pre-experimental research. The subject of the study was the seventh grade students of SMPN 36 Surabaya. The data was the students’ pre-test and <b>post-test</b> in <b>procedures</b> text material. Then, the data was analyzed by using sample paired t-test. The instruments were observation check list and test. Result of post-test score that has been analyzed by using sample paired t- test shows thitung = 10. 86 and tlabel = 2, 02 with significance level 5 % or 0, 05. It means that t hitung> t tabel. So, there is a significance influence on students’ achievement before and after the application of STAD. The result indicated that cooperative learning - STAD method has influence in improving students’ achievement, because the students’ score in post-test is better than in pre-test. Based on the result of this study, researcher suggests that cooperative learning - STAD applied at the certain topics or theme. Further, in order to make time more effective, it may use count down timer or work time framer for each teams and never forget to make a clear explanation. To solve a noisy, it may give students an instant assignment on the board or give them some hand gestures that means they need to be more quite...|$|R

Studies have yet {{to examine the effects}} of fatigue on this ratio. The purpose of the present study was to compare the knee flexor/extensor ratio before and after a fatiguing task to determine if the ratio is altered. Twenty- seven (N= 27, male= 20 and female = 7) healthy high school varsity and collegiate athletes (ages 15 - 24 yrs, mean 19. 2 yrs.) participated in the study. Individuals' dominant leg knee flexor and extensor muscles were tested with the Cybex 340 dynamometer at speeds of 60, 180 and 300 °/second. The flexor/extensor ratio was calculated by the Cybex 340 computer. Subjects were then fatigued by having them run against a resistance and immediately post-tested on the Cybex 340. A significance level of 0. 05 was used for all hypothesis testing. A 2 X 3 ANOVA with repeated measures was used to compare pre-test verses <b>post-test</b> values. ANOVA <b>procedures</b> were used to compare effects of speed within subjects. The analysis of variance revealed a significant difference between pre- and post-test (p= 0. 027), indicating fatigue does have an effect on the flexor/extensor ratio. The dependent t-test reveals a significant change in the flexor/extensor ratio only at 60 °/second. The ANOVA showed a significant difference (p< 0. 05) in ratios when comparing effects of speed. The flexor/extensor ratio increased as the speed increased. The findings of the present study indicate that fatigue does have an effect on the flexor ratio. However, there was a great individual variance between subjects. M. S. Ed. (Master of Education...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with finding effective ways of changing the attitudes of teachers and Education students towards disabled persons in Newfoundland and Labrador. Since education was considered by many previous studies {{to be an important}} factor in attitude change, the study looked at the effects of a course offered by Memorial University, St. John's, Newfoundland, Education 3230, a survey course providing information about disabled children. Two modes of instruction, live instruction and video tape instruction, were considered to determine if one was more effective in changing attitudes. The original data were collected in 1974; additional data concerning live instruction were collected in 1981 to determine if there was any change in attitude over this time. [...] There were 474 subjects in this study. There were five groups in the study: Group A, live instruction, on campus, in 1974; Group B, video tape instruction, off campus, in 1974; Group C, control, on campus, in 1974; Group D, live instruction, on campus, in 1981; Group E, control, on campus, in 1981. Students were not assigned individually to groups. There were at least two classes in each group. Half of the classes were used for pre-test data and half were used for post-test data to insure randomization. [...] The instrument used to measure attitudes was the Attitudes Towards Disabled Persons Scale, forms A and B. A pre-test measurement was completed {{at the beginning of the}} term and a post-test measurement at the end of the term. [...] The analysis included a two way ANOVA using the regression approach and a two way ANOVA using equal-sized groups. These showed that there was a difference among the groups in attitude but that no one group showed a significant difference between the pre-test and <b>post-test.</b> An aposteri <b>procedure,</b> the Newman-Keuls used to compare group mean scores, confirmed that there was no significant difference at the. 05 level between pre and post-test means for any one group. The difference was between the 1974 and 1981 groups. An ANOVA using the regression approach was performed on each of eight demographic variables (occupation, grade level taught, age, sex, previous education course, having a disabled relative, frequency of contact and work experience), comparing the 1974 and 1981 data. The results supported the fact that the difference was between the two time periods. The only demographic variable to have a significant influence on actitude change was having a relative or friend who is disabled. [...] The conclusion was that although the treatments had some effect, none were significant. The 1981 group had significantly more favorable attitudes than the 1974 groups, possibly because of increased public awareness and opportunity for contact and integration with the physically disabled. The results indicated that a course which provided information and an opportunity for close personal contact on a social level might be most effective in changing attitudes...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{concerned}} with investigating student achievement testing results, age and sex differences, and teaching practices between a behavioral objective type program and a convetional type program (arbitrarily defined) for the teaching of reading to third grade children as measured by standardized test instruments. Thirty-one third grade students (16 boys and 15 girls) in the experimental class, with a median age of eight years, were compared with a control class of 33 students (19 boys and 14 girls), with a median age of nine years, as available small samples. Both groups were taught by one teacher. The instructional materials selected were Houghton Mifflin’s Panorama and workbook for the behavioral or experimental class. Follett’s New Faces, New Places {{was used by the}} conventional group. Lippincott’s Reading in Phonics lessons were used by both groups twice weekly. The Stanford Achievement Reading Test—Form W, Primary II was administered as pre-and <b>post-test</b> instruments. Testing <b>procedures</b> for both groups with respect to time allotment, administration, and administrator for each test were consistent. All pre- and post-test measures were collected and translated into appropriate numerical equivalents. From these data, means and standard deviations were established for both groups as well as within age and sex groupings. The Fisher t-test of significant differences between independent group means was used in handling the data. “z” scores were applied to all data to equate an uncontrolled group variances. Teaching methodologies of two audio-recorded lessons were coded with an interaction analysis system measuring teacher verbalism. The variables of age and sex revealed no significant differences appearing in the measured results of the study. Teaching methodologies by the same teacher of both groups were proven to be significantly consistent based on types of teacher verbalism. Although the experimental group exhibited pre-test superiority by age, rated cognitive abilities, vocabulary and paragraph meaning, and composite test means, the control group showed significant pre- to post- test gains in both paragraph meaning and composite means. Observational reports by the teacher, however, indicated superior affective attitudes and interests in reading for the experimental group. Consistent with Gerhard’s study, the findings, based on standard achievement tests, “…indicated {{no significant differences between the}} experimental and control groups. ” In the present study, the experimental group showed no significant gains in both paragraph meaning and composite means. Observational reports by the teacher, however, indicated superior affective attitudes and interests in reading for the experimental group. Consistent with Gerhard’s study, the findings, based on standard achievement tests, “…indicated no significant differences between the experimental and control groups. ” IN the present study, the experimental group showed no significant gains from pre-to post-test. Thus, a conventional-factual approach was congruent with the achievement measures of the control group employed in the study. Test exercises, in view of word choices for young children, seem not to be consistent with children’s oral or written language. It seems logical to assume that such test construction may not enhance the reader’s comprehension. According to Chall, “…low IQ pupils achieved best results with phonic approaches. ” The lower achieving control group excelled at a significant level in pre- to post-test measures. Since both groups were exposed to bi-weekly phonics instruction, such impact may have been greater on the control group...|$|R
