5|$|The euro {{was founded}} on 1 January 1999, when it became the {{currency}} of over 300 million people in Europe. For {{the first three years}} of its existence it was an invisible currency, only used in accounting. Euro cash was not introduced until 1 January 2002, when it replaced the national banknotes and coins of the 12 countries in the eurozone, such as the Dutch guilder and the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo.</b>|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Bosnia, Bulgaria, Macedonia (which had pegged their currencies against the Deutsche Mark) and Cape Verde (formerly pegged to the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo),</b> all of these non-EU countries had a currency peg to the French Franc before pegging their currencies to the euro. Pegging a country's currency to a major currency {{is regarded as a}} safety measure, especially for currencies of areas with weak economies, as the euro is seen as a stable currency, prevents runaway inflation and encourages foreign investment due to its stability.|$|E
5|$|Demonstrations {{occurred}} at Spain's embassy and consulates in France. The Spanish embassy in Brussels was fire-bombed. A day of national demonstration was organised by the Dutch {{government and a}} protest in Utrecht was led by Prime Minister Joop den Uyl. In Britain, the governing Labour Party passed a resolution condemning the executions. Poland and Hungary withdrew their commercial representatives in Spain, and 15 European countries (West Germany, East Germany, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, Portugal, Austria, Sweden, Ireland, Luxembourg and Italy) withdrew their ambassadors to Spain in protest. In response, Spain withdrew its ambassadors from Norway, East Germany, The Vatican, West Germany and The Netherlands for consultations, with its ambassador to Portugal unconditionally withdrawn in protest at the embassy attack. Spain's central bank also suspended trade in the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo.</b>|$|E
25|$|Indo-Portuguese issues : The Portuguese Indian Rupia was the {{currency}} of Portuguese India until 1959. It was divisible into 16 Tangas or 960 Reis. In 1959, {{the currency}} was changed to the <b>Portuguese</b> Indian <b>Escudo,</b> {{at the rate of}} 1 Rupia for 6 Escudos.|$|R
2500|$|The Indian rupee {{replaced}} the Danish Indian rupee in 1845, the French Indian rupee in 1954 and the <b>Portuguese</b> Indian <b>escudo</b> in 1961. Following {{the independence of}} British India in 1947 and the accession of the princely states to the new Union, the Indian rupee replaced all the currencies of the previously autonomous states (although the Hyderabadi rupee was not demonetised until 1959). [...] Some of the states had issued rupees equal to those issued by the British (such as the Travancore rupee). Other currencies (including the Hyderabadi rupee and the Kutch kori) had different values.|$|R
25|$|In 1935, when Hong Kong and China {{abandoned}} the silver standard, the Hong Kong unit was pegged to sterling {{at a rate}} of 1 shilling and 3 pence, while the Macau pataca was pegged to the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo</b> {{at a rate of}} 5.5 escudos. This meant that the Macau pataca was worth only 1 shilling sterling and was therefore at a discount of 3 pence sterling in relation to the Hong Kong unit.|$|E
25|$|A grid (known as the Parity Grid) of {{bilateral}} rates was calculated {{on the basis}} of these central rates expressed in ECUs, and currency fluctuations had to be contained within a margin of 2.25% on either side of the bilateral rates (with the exception of the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta, the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo</b> and the pound sterling, which were allowed to fluctuate by ±6%). Determined intervention and loan arrangements protected the participating currencies from greater exchange rate fluctuations.|$|E
25|$|Reis's fraud had {{enormous}} repercussions {{on the economy}} and politics of Portugal. By the end of 1925 Reis had managed to introduce escudo banknotes worth £1,007,963 (at 1925 exchange rates: £ in modern pounds) into the Portuguese economy. The exchange rate of the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo</b> fell and it lost much of its credibility. After the scheme was found out, the Bank of Portugal ordered the withdrawal of all 500 escudo banknotes within 20 days, by December 26; 115,000 counterfeit notes were withdrawn.|$|E
2500|$|The escudo português (<b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo)</b> ( [...] ; sign $; code: PTE) was the {{currency}} of Portugal prior {{to the introduction of}} the euro on 1 January 1999 and its removal from circulation on 28 February 2002. [...] The escudo was subdivided into 100 centavos. The word escudo means [...] "shield".|$|E
2500|$|In Macau, {{the unit}} of {{currency}} is the pataca, which is currently pegged to the Hong Kong dollar {{at a rate of}} HK$1= MOP1.03. The name pataca is a Portuguese word which was applied to the Mexican dollars that were the main circulating coin in the wider region {{in the second half of}} the 19th century. In 1894, the pataca was introduced in both Macau and Portuguese Timor as a unit of account for the Mexican dollar and the other silver dollar coins in circulation. However, the pataca was not the official currency when it was first enacted. In 1901, it was decided to grant the Banco Nacional Ultramarino the exclusive rights to issue banknotes denominated in patacas, and in the year 1906, all foreign coins were outlawed. However, the Chinese were suspicious of these paper patacas, being so accustomed to using silver for barter, and as such, the paper patacas circulated at a discount in relation to the silver dollar coins. In 1935, when China and Hong Kong abandoned the silver standard, the Hong Kong dollar was pegged to sterling at the fixed rate of 1 shilling and 3 pence, whereas the pataca was pegged to the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo</b> at a sterling equivalent rate of only 1 shilling. From 1945 to 1951, fractional coins of the pataca were minted for issue in Portuguese Timor; and, in 1952, similar issues were minted for Macau including an actual pataca coin for the first time.|$|E
50|$|Until {{independence}} in 1975, the Cape Verde escudo was {{equal to the}} <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo.</b> Subsequently it depreciated, declining by about 30 per cent in 1977-8 and by a further 40 per cent in 1982-84. Thereafter, it remained fairly stable against the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo.</b>|$|E

50|$|In mid-1998 an {{agreement}} with Portugal established a pegged rate of 1 <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo</b> = 0.55 Cape Verdean escudo. Since {{the replacement of the}} <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo</b> with the euro, the Cape Verdean escudo has been pegged to the euro at a rate of 1 euro = 110$265. This peg is supported by a credit facility from the Portuguese government.|$|E

50|$|The escudo was the {{currency}} of Angola between 1914 and 1928 and again between 1958 and 1977. It was subdivided into 100 centavos with the macuta worth 5 centavos and was equivalent to the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo.</b>|$|E
50|$|Coins {{were issued}} for the Azores until 1901 and {{banknotes}} were issued between 1895 and 1910. Although the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo</b> replaced the real (1000 réis = 1 escudo) in 1911, the Azorean banknotes continued to circulate until 1932.|$|E
50|$|Cape Verde has {{significant}} cooperation with Portugal {{at every level}} of the economy, which has led it to link its currency first to the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo</b> and, in 1999, to the euro. On 23 June 2008 Cape Verde became the 153rd member of the WTO.|$|E
50|$|The escudo was the {{currency}} of Portuguese India between 1958 and 1961. It was divisible into 100 centavos and was equal in value to the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo.</b> After Portuguese India was annexed by the Republic of India in 1961, the escudo {{was replaced by the}} Indian rupee.|$|E
50|$|The escudo {{replaced}} the rupia {{at the rate}} of 1 rupia = 6 escudos. This was due to the respective values of the Indian rupee (to which the rupia was pegged) and the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo,</b> with 1 rupee = 18 British pence and 1 escudo = 3 pence.|$|E
50|$|The escudo was the {{currency}} of Portuguese Timor between 1959 and 1976. It replaced the pataca {{at a rate of}} 5.6 escudos = 1 pataca and was equivalent to the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo.</b> It was replaced by the Indonesian rupiah following East Timor's occupation by Indonesia. The escudo was subdivided into 100 centavos.|$|E
5000|$|The escudo (Portuguese: [...] "shield") was {{a unit of}} {{currency}} historically used in Portugal and in their colonies in South America, Asia, and Africa. It was originally worth 16 silver reais. The Cape Verdean escudo and the former <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo</b> (PTE), each subdivided into 100 centavos, are named after the historical currency.|$|E
50|$|The scudo (pl. scudi) was {{the name}} {{for a number of}} coins used in Italy until the 19th century. The name, like that of the French écu and the Spanish and <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo,</b> was derived from the Latin scutum ("shield"). From the 16th century, the name was used in Italy for large silver coins. Sizes varied {{depending}} on the issuing country.|$|E
50|$|It was {{formerly}} {{used by the}} <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo</b> (ISO: PTE) before its replacement by the euro and by the Portuguese Timor escudo (ISO: TPE) before its replacement by the Indonesian rupiah and the US dollar. In Portuguese and Cape Verdean usage, the cifrão is placed as a decimal point between the escudo and centavo values (e.g., 2$50). The name originates in the Arabic cifr.|$|E
50|$|The escudo was the {{currency}} of Portuguese Guinea between 1914 and 1975. It was equal to the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo</b> and replaced the real {{at a rate of}} 1000 réis = 1 escudo. The escudo was subdivided into 100 centavos. Portugal issued banknotes (starting in 1914) and coins (starting in 1933) for use in Portuguese Guinea. Following independence, the peso replaced the escudo at par.|$|E
50|$|In 1935, when Hong Kong and China {{abandoned}} the silver standard, the Hong Kong unit was pegged to sterling {{at a rate}} of 1 shilling and 3 pence, while the Macau pataca was pegged to the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo</b> {{at a rate of}} 5.5 escudos. This meant that the Macau pataca was worth only 1 shilling sterling and was therefore at a discount of 3 pence sterling in relation to the Hong Kong unit.|$|E
50|$|The escudo {{replaced}} the real {{at a rate}} of 1 escudo = 1000 réis. It was equal in value to the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo</b> until 1977. Initially, Mozambique had its own paper money but used Portuguese coins. Only in 1935 were coins issued specifically for use in Mozambique. In 1975, the metica was proposed as a replacement for the escudo, but it was not used. The escudo was replaced by the metical in 1980 at par.|$|E

50|$|The angolar was {{introduced}} in 1928 to replace the escudo. Banknotes were exchanged {{at a rate of}} 1 angolar = 1.25 escudos. However, the exchange rate with the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo</b> remained at par, indicating that the earlier Angolan banknotes were devalued as part of the reform, rather than the angolar actually having a new, higher value. Coins (all denominated in centavos and macutas) were unaffected by the reform. In 1958, the name of the currency was switched back to escudo after a period of time during which coins denominated in escudos had already begun to circulate.|$|E
50|$|Nickel silver {{first became}} popular {{as a base}} metal for {{silver-plated}} cutlery and other silverware, notably the electroplated wares called EPNS (electro-plated nickel silver). It is used in zippers, better-quality keys, costume jewellery, for making musical instruments (e.g., flutes, clarinets), and is preferred for the track in electrically powered model railway layouts, as its oxide is conductive. It is widely used {{in the production of}} coins (e.g. <b>Portuguese</b> <b>escudo</b> and the former GDR marks). Its industrial and technical uses include marine fittings and plumbing fixtures for its corrosion resistance, and heating coils for its high electrical resistance.|$|E
