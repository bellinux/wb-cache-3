500|$|Officer Lang {{observed}} that Drayton and Brown were wearing [...] "heavy jackets and baggy pants", despite warm weather that day. Lang suspected Brown and Drayton {{might have been}} using their baggy clothing to conceal weapons or drugs, so he asked Brown, [...] "o you mind if I check your person?" [...] Brown responded, [...] "ure", leaned up in his seat, removed a cellular phone from his pocket, and opened his jacket. Lang <b>patted</b> <b>down</b> the outside of his clothing and felt small packages [...] "similar to drug packages detected on other occasions". Officer Lang then arrested Brown, handcuffed him, and Officer Hoover walked him off the bus. Lang then asked Drayton, [...] "ind if I check you?", to which Drayton responded [...] "by lifting his hands about eight inches from his legs". Lang detected similar objects during a pat down of Drayton's legs, placed him under arrest, and escorted him off the bus. A further search determined that Brown had duct-taped three bundles containing 483 grams of cocaine between several layers of boxer shorts, and Drayton had duct-taped two bundles between several layers of boxer shorts containing 295 grams of cocaine.|$|E
60|$|The {{supplementary}} {{reading in}} sociology {{led her to}} a book on village-improvement--tree-planting, town pageants, girls' clubs. It had pictures of greens and garden-walls in France, New England, Pennsylvania. She had picked it up carelessly, with a slight yawn which she <b>patted</b> <b>down</b> with her finger-tips as delicately as a cat.|$|E
60|$|The old wizard took up {{the little}} assegai which he had offered to me and with its blade raked our ashes from the fire that always burnt in front of him. While he did so, he talked to me, as I thought in a random fashion, perhaps to {{distract}} my attention, of a certain white man whom he said I should meet upon my journey and of his affairs, also of other matters, none of which interested me much at the time. These ashes he <b>patted</b> <b>down</b> flat and then on them drew a map with the point of his spear, making grooves for streams, certain marks for bush and forest, wavy lines for water and swamps and little heaps for hills.|$|E

When it burns, it produces smoke and numerous indoor air pollutants at concentrations 5 {{times higher than}} coal.|$|E
5000|$|The plainclothes officer {{approached}} the three, {{identified himself as}} a police officer, and asked their names. The men [...] "mumbled something", whereupon McFadden spun Terry around, <b>patted</b> <b>down</b> his outside clothing, and felt a pistol in his overcoat pocket. He reached inside the overcoat pocket, {{but was unable to}} remove the gun. The officer ordered the three into the store. He removed Terry's overcoat, took out a revolver, and ordered the three to face the wall with their hands raised. He <b>patted</b> <b>down</b> the outer clothing of Chilton and Katz and seized a revolver from Chilton's outside overcoat pocket. He did not put his hands under the outer garments of Katz (since he discovered nothing in his pat-down which might have been a weapon), or under Terry's or Chilton's outer garments until he felt the guns. The three were taken to the police station. Terry and Chilton were subsequently charged with carrying concealed weapons.|$|E
5000|$|On April 14, 2017, sheriffs deputies {{placed the}} school on {{lockdown}} {{for four hours}} and conducted a warrantless drug sweep. Around 40 officers <b>patted</b> <b>down</b> about 900 students, allegedly cupping their genitals, reaching inside bras, touching girls' bare breasts, patting their buttocks and placing their hands inside students' underwear. No drugs were discovered, and a the Southern Center for Human Rights filed a lawsuit on the students' behalf.|$|E

50|$|The Court {{disagreed}} with the state appeals court’s characterization of Johnson’s encounter with the police as consensual. It quoted the dissenting state appellate court judge, who noted that the <b>pat</b> <b>down</b> occurred shortly after the car had been stopped, and that Johnson would not reasonably have felt {{he was free to}} leave {{at the time of the}} <b>pat</b> <b>down.</b> The Court observed that a seizure occurs when the police stop a car for a traffic violation, and the seizure continues and is usually reasonable until the police inform the car’s occupants that they’re free to leave. In addition, questioning by the police about a matter unrelated to the traffic stop does not make the stop unlawful, as long as those inquiries do not measurably extend the duration of the stop.Here, the traffic stop communicated to Johnson that he was not free to leave, and nothing prior to the <b>pat</b> <b>down</b> indicated otherwise. The police were not required to give Johnson the opportunity to leave without ensuring that he was not armed and dangerous.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, maize tortillas {{were made}} from nixtamalized maize; kernels were soaked in a {{solution}} of lime (calcium hydroxide) and water to remove their skins; this also increases the bioavailability of then-unknown niacin. The grains were then ground into maize dough (masa). A golf ball-sized piece of dough was <b>patted</b> <b>down</b> by hand into a thin pancake shape, placed on a hot griddle (comal), and cooked on both sides. This tortilla-making process is still used today in southern Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|Individuals {{still have}} the right to opt out of the scanner and choose a pat-down if the {{individual}} is uncomfortable going through the scanner. Individuals also {{have the right to}} be <b>patted</b> <b>down</b> in a private room and have it witnessed by a person of the individual's choice.However, as of December 15, 2015 the TSA has published a new policy with regards to opt outs which requires AIT to be [...] "mandatory" [...] for [...] "some" [...] passengers for [...] "security reasons".|$|E
50|$|In early 2011, a TSA VIPR {{detained}} and <b>patted</b> <b>down</b> {{people at}} an Amtrak station in Savannah, Georgia. The incident became controversial because instead of screening passengers as they boarded trains—the standard procedure—officers were screening passengers {{as they were}} getting off trains, presumably after potential terrorists had detonated their explosives. According to Trains magazine, Amtrak Police Chief John O'Connor described the TSA behavior as illegal, in violation of Amtrak policy, and simply nonsensical. The incident led Amtrak to temporarily ban VIPR teams from Amtrak property.|$|E

50|$|When {{the two men}} reach Brooklyn, Crow makes several {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts to}} wake Bones up. He then decides to leave without him, leaving a note under his arm. Deciding to put off going to Danny's house, Crow steps into the Palm Coast Bar, an after-hours spot and notorious drug den. The police raid the bar. Crow is able to throw his drugs on the floor before the police see him snorting up. He is <b>patted</b> <b>down</b> by a police officer who doesn't find anything on him and leads him toward the door to release him. On the way out, he bumps into Sergeant Dobson, {{an old friend of}} Crow's late police officer father.|$|E
50|$|Officer Finley {{testified that}} at 12:35 AM on February 21, he and Officer Wrigley {{heard a sound}} that they {{believed}} to be a gunshot. He said they saw a van going the wrong way down a one-way street with its lights off. The officers followed it through several stop signs, then pulled it over. Finley says that he drew his gun as Morgan got out of his own car. Finley and Wrigley were joined by Olsen and White. Finley testified that Morgan complied with an order to put his hands on the van, but then began to struggle while being <b>patted</b> <b>down.</b> Finley describes an extended gunfight, during which Morgan fired at the officers from the ground. He explains the bullets in Morgan's back by saying that the officers were spread out, and so when Morgan stood up, he had to turn all around to shoot at them.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to a {{software}} upgrade the technology did not mask {{any part of}} the bodies {{of the people who were}} being scanned. However, passengers' faces were deliberately masked by the system. The photos were screened by technicians in a closed room, then deleted immediately upon search completion. Privacy advocates are concerned. [...] "We're getting closer and closer to a required strip-search to board an airplane," [...] said Barry Steinhardt of the American Civil Liberties Union. [...] To address this issue, upgrades have eliminated the need for an officer in a separate viewing area. The new software generates a generic image of a human. There is no anatomical differentiation between male and female on the image, and if an object is detected, the software only presents a yellow box in the area. If the device does not detect anything of interest, no image is presented. [...] Passengers can decline scanning and be screened via a metal detector and <b>patted</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dewhurst {{was accused}} by state senator Dan Patrick of helping {{to stop a}} bill, the passage of {{which would have been}} an attempt to make the <b>pat</b> <b>downs</b> of {{airplane}} passengers by personnel of the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA) a felony in Texas.|$|R
50|$|Kinsey {{stated that}} after being shot, police turned {{him on his}} back, handcuffed him, and left him {{bleeding}} {{on the road for}} 20 minutes. Police did nothing to stop Kinsey's bleeding before an ambulance arrived.

50|$|Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U.S. 323 (2009), is a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held, by {{unanimous}} decision, that police may conduct a <b>pat</b> <b>down</b> search of a passenger in an automobile that has been lawfully stopped for a minor traffic violation, provided the police reasonably suspect the passenger is armed and dangerous.|$|R
50|$|Diablo and {{his crew}} of men chase a car down with a white driver. His car flips over, and they proceed to take a bag from his car. They meet up at a house and go upstairs to {{question}} a white man (the same one that was <b>patted</b> <b>down</b> earlier). An entire group of African American gangsters surround him as he sits in a single chair in the room. They ask him why he was near the {{high school in the}} area. Being threatened, he tells them about a shipment of drugs coming in but does not know exactly know when or how. J.J. and his men keep questioning him {{but it is clear that}} he does not know anything else. They allow him to run away. The next scene, they break into another gangster’s home and kill him. They do not care about taking any of the drugs. At this point, J.J. and the men are taking more and more action to stomp out the men who are invading and have stake on their territory.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shooting}} {{sparked a}} discussion on the adequacy of security at U.S. military facilities. On September 18, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ordered a review of security procedures at military facilities around the world. Foreign Policy magazine reported that virtually anyone with a Common Access Card (C.A.C.), provided to government contractors, civilian Defense Department employees, and soldiers, can enter many military facilities [...] "without being <b>patted</b> <b>down</b> or made {{to go through a}} metal detector". The shooter had a Secret-level security clearance and a C.A.C. allowing him to enter the Navy Yard. Conservative commentators including Alex Jones, Ted Nugent, and others suggested that [...] "gun-free zones" [...] on military bases were to blame for the massacre. On NBC's Meet the Press, National Rifle Association leader Wayne LaPierre said, [...] "when the good guys with guns got there, it stopped." [...] In the libertarian Reason magazine, J.D. Tuccille said that on domestic U.S. military bases, most soldiers are prohibited from carrying guns, and that this made the base more vulnerable to an attack.|$|E
50|$|From a bus {{on the way}} to Hebron she rings Omar {{and asks}} if he could meet her there. At a {{military}} checkpoint a liberal Israeli guide is explaining to a group that part of the city has been closed off as a 'sterile zone'; he is being barracked by an orthodox settler with a megaphone. Erin slips past the group and into the zone. She meets a group of Palestinian schoolgirls walking home from school. The girls are verbally abused crossing a playground, then stoned by some young Jewish boys, while IDF soldiers stand by and watch. Erin improvises a bandage for a cut on one of the girls' heads. The group are able to point her to a house that matches her address. At the doorway she is met by a Jewish orthodox woman. Inside she is led to a room where orthodox men are eating. Erin starts to explain her quest, when two IDF soldiers arrive, brought by the daughter, to lead Erin away. Behind her the man furiously rebukes the woman. Outside, she is <b>patted</b> <b>down</b> and bundled into an IDF military vehicle. Erin secretly sends text from her phone while she is driven away.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "heightened {{security}} measures" [...] {{also affected}} the target populations. During the bombing campaign Israelis were questioned by armed guards {{and given a}} quick <b>pat</b> <b>down</b> before being let into cafes. In the US, the post-9/11 era meant [...] "previously inconceivable security measures—in airports and other transportation hubs, hotels and office buildings, sports stadiums and concert halls".|$|R

These <b>pat</b> <b>downs</b> may include the touching of sensitive areas such as breasts and genitals.|$|R
25|$|Despite some solid Test knocks for Australia, he {{is remembered}} {{more for a}} couple of legends of the early days of Test cricket than for {{anything}} he did on the field.

5000|$|Officer Lang {{observed}} that Drayton and Brown were wearing [...] "heavy jackets and baggy pants", despite warm weather that day.

5000|$|In 2010 {{the group}} {{took on a}} number of cases {{regarding}} the Transportation Security Administration's controversial security procedures at American airports. The organization filed a lawsuit in November 2010 against Janet Napolitano, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and John Pistole, the head of the Transportation Security Administration, on behalf of airline pilots Michael Roberts and Ann Poe. The pilots objected to being subjected to [...] "whole body imaging" [...] scanners, which reveal the nude body of the subject being searched, as well as a pat-down. John W. Whitehead said of the matter, [...] "Forcing Americans to undergo a virtual strip search {{as a matter of course}} in reporting to work or boarding an airplane when there is no suspicion of wrongdoing is a grotesque violation of our civil liberties." [...] The next month the Rutherford Institute filed another lawsuit on the behalf of three passengers who took issue with the TSA screening procedures: a 12-year-old girl placed in a body scanner without parental consent, a man who was subjected to an invasive pat down in his genital area due to an abnormality caused by a childhood injury, and a woman who had undergone a mastectomy and was required to be <b>patted</b> <b>down</b> in her breast area.|$|E
50|$|Although {{tourism in}} the prison of San Pedro is illegal, many {{entrants}} can gain access to a tour by bribing the guards who are placed {{to make sure that}} none of the prisoners who are {{in the prison}} come out. Those who wish to tour the prison must first be snuck in by someone who knows the way in from the outside. Tourist are taken into a room and their names are entered into a registry book along with their passport numbers. Guards then mark the tourist’s arms with a number that corresponds to their name in the book and that serves as their identification as tourist and allows them to exit the prison once the tour is over. The fee to enter the prison is around $57 US dollars or 400 boliviano and after being <b>patted</b> <b>down</b> by the guards entrants are told to make sure they leave before 6pm and not to take any pictures. Despite the perceived dangers and legal issues regarding the tours, the prison is estimated to have once had approximately 50 tours daily.Tourism of the prison is conducted in many ways like tourism in any other place. Your host is usually a tour guide, someone with intensive knowledge of the history, layout, rules and regulation of the prison. Once inside the prison tourist are introduced to their tour guide and bodyguard and asked to register their information once again before the tour begins. Many people from around the globe have traveled to La Paz in order to visit {{one of the most interesting}} prisons in the world.|$|E
50|$|The clay used {{to create}} this jar was mixed with stone {{fragments}} and pebbles, resulting in an uneven surface that resembles the natural variations of granite. It was formed by quickly <b>patting</b> <b>down</b> clay coils, for a rough, asymmetrical profile. The glaze was made when ashes from the wood burning in the kiln landed on the vessel and liquified, their varying amounts of iron resulting in the different colors.|$|R
