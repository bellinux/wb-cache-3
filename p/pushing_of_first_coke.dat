5000|$|The Cyfarthfa {{works were}} begun in 1765 by Anthony Bacon (by then a {{merchant}} in London), who {{in that year}} with William Brownrigg, his fellow native of Whitehaven, Cumberland leased the right to mine in a tract of 4000 acre land {{on the west side}} of the river Taff at Merthyr Tydfil. [...] They employed Brownrigg's brother-in-law Charles Wood to build a forge there, to use the potting and stamping process, for which he and his brother had a patent. This was powered by water from the river, the race dividing into six to power a clay mill (for making the pots), two stampers, two hammers and a chafery. The construction <b>of</b> the <b>first</b> <b>coke</b> blast furnace began in August 1766. This was intended to be 50 feet high with cast iron blowing cylinders, rather than the traditional bellows. It was probably brought into blast in Autumn 1767. [...] In the meantime, Plymouth ironworks was leased to provide pig iron for the forge.|$|R

500|$|Coke {{has come}} under {{criticism}} for his examples to justify his decision. The first case that he gave, Tregor's Case, was seriously misquoted. Coke stated, [...] "Herle said some statutes are made against law and right, which those who made them perceiving, would not put into execution". In fact, there is no reference to [...] "law and right" [...] {{is found in the}} original text; Herle wrote that [...] "there are some statutes made which he himself who made them does not will to put into execution", meaning only that some statutes are poorly drafted, and if they cannot be interpreted to work, Parliament would accept the courts not applying them. Theodore Plucknett wrote, [...] "Whoever reads the whole of Herle's remarks can see that he did not regard the statute then under discussion as falling within this category; on the contrary, he suggested a perfectly obvious and straightforward interpretation <b>of</b> it.... <b>Coke's</b> <b>first</b> authority is far from convincing".|$|R

40|$|The first {{passage is}} a generic concept for {{quantifying}} when a random quantity {{such as the}} position of a diffusing molecule or the value of a stock crosses a preset threshold (target) for the first time. The last decade saw an enlightening series of new results focusing mostly on the so-called mean and global first passage time (MFPT and GFPT, respectively) of such processes. Here we <b>push</b> the understanding <b>of</b> <b>first</b> passage processes a step further. For a simple heterogeneous system we derive rigorously the complete distribution <b>of</b> <b>first</b> passage times (FPTs). Our results demonstrate that the typical FPT significantly differs from the MFPT, which corresponds to the long time behaviour of the FPT distribution. Conversely, the short time behaviour is shown to correspond to trajectories connecting directly from the initial value to the target. Remarkably, we reveal a previously overlooked third characteristic time scale <b>of</b> the <b>first</b> passage dynamics mirroring brief excursion away from the target.

40|$|Tunamis {{generated}} {{in a sea}} of any depth display normal dispersion. With time increase, the waves are more and more oscillatory, the oscillatory range of the same waves augmenting increasingly. The length and period of the waves, particularly, near the wave front, tend to so increase that they are generally greater than those of the waves that correspond to the disturbance at the origin. As to the distribution of amplitudes in a train of tunamis, a regular law obtains between the sea depth h and the number α that indicates the wave form at the origin. The smaller the ratio of h/α, the more the wave of maximum amplitude approaches the front in the train of tunamis. However, even should the ratio h/α be infinitely great, there is no wave of maximum amplitude {{at the rear of the}} train of finite amplitudes. In any case, the wave period in a train is; greatest at its front, diminishing toward its rear. If the vertical amplitude of tunamis alone were considered, it is possible for the pull and <b>push</b> <b>of</b> the <b>first</b> motion <b>of</b> tunamis to correspond to the depression and upheaval of the sea bed at the earthquake origin. If the sea depth were much smaller than the dimension of the area of original disturbance, the form of tunamis would be a relief of the deformation of the sea bed. In any case, the front of a train of tunamis is transmitted with the velocity of shallow water waves corresponding to the sea depth...|$|R

5000|$|Following a {{relatively}} quiet winter the 87th Guards {{participated in the}} Crimean Offensive. The division's task was to break through German positions across the low and narrow Isthmus of Perekop, beginning on Apr. 6, 1944. In the initial fighting the German forces were <b>pushed</b> out <b>of</b> their <b>first</b> line <b>of</b> trenches, at considerable cost, but no breakthrough was made. During the night the 261st Guards Rifle Regiment was withdrawn from the line and began a long flanking march to the shore of Karkinit Bay, which was just knee-deep at this point. After wading for 20 minutes the regiment reached the opposite shore, outflanking the Germans and forcing them to fall back several kilometres. This set up a running fight down {{the west coast of}} Crimea, and by Apr. 20 the division reached the city of Evpatoriya. In recognition of this victory, a 24-gun salute was fired in Moscow, and the 87th Guards Rifle Division was awarded the honorific [...] "Perekop" [...] (Russian: [...] "Перекопская").|$|R
500|$|His Law Reports, {{known as}} Coke's Reports, were an archive of judgements from cases he had participated in, watched or heard of. They started with notes he {{made as a}} law student {{in the winter of}} 1572, with full {{reporting}} of cases from October 1579. The Reports were initially written down in seven notebooks, four of which are lost; the first notebook contains not only law reports, but also a draft version <b>of</b> <b>Coke's</b> <b>first</b> Institutes <b>of</b> the Lawes of England. Coke began reporting cases in the traditional manner, by copying out and repeating cases found in earlier law reports, such as those of Edmund Plowden. After being called to the Bar in 1578 he began attending court cases at Westminster Hall, and soon drew the attention of court officials – many early reports have notes that he was told [...] "by old Plowden" [...] or [...] "by Wray CJ". The original reports were kept in a generally chronological order, interspersed with personal memos, obituaries and notes on court practices. They are not entirely chronological; during his career, Coke took note of earlier cases he had heard of or which had drawn his attention. These were written down with the plea roll reference and the year in which Coke recorded them, but later editions failed to include the plea roll reference and led to inaccuracies.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>push</b> <b>of</b> pike was a {{particular}} feature of late medieval and Early Modern warfare that occurred when two opposing columns of pikemen (often Swiss mercenaries or Landsknechte) met and became locked in position along a front of interleaved pikes. During <b>push</b> <b>of</b> pike, opposing blocks of pikemen would advance with their pikes [...] "charged" [...] horizontally at shoulder level to jab at one another until bodily contact was made. The two sides would then push physically until one or other of them gave way. The <b>push</b> <b>of</b> pike would continue until one of the opposing formations routed or fled, which would generally lead to massive casualties. Each man pressed on the one in front, and so sometimes the formations would crush against each other and many pikemen would have to fight in closer melee combat. The Italians referred to this as 'Bad War' after seeing Swiss pikemen become locked in thick combat, where because both formations refused to back down both sides lost huge numbers {{of men in the}} bloody melee. Rodeleros along with the Doppelsöldner were used in order to break <b>push</b> <b>of</b> pike engagements. The <b>push</b> <b>of</b> pike {{played an important role in}} the English civil war as one-third of the infantry consisted of pikemen. Pikemen often cut down the lengths of their pikes in order to make them more manageable. This habit had on many occasions disastrous consequences as the side with the longest pikes had the advantage during <b>push</b> <b>of</b> pike.|$|R
