The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and effectiveness of direct determination of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from patients with sarcoidosis, idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> fibrosis, and <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> and healthy (smoking and non-smoking) controls. A total of 44 individuals were recruited among sarcoidosis, idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> fibrosis, and <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> patients and healthy (smoking and non-smoking) controls. Average Mn concentrations in BAL from patients were 45 % lower than in controls (p < 0. 01) and remarkable decreases in average concentrations of Cr, Ni and Zn were also found in BAL from patients with idiopathic <b>pulmonary</b> fibrosis and <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis.</b> As these diseases are characterized by the enhanced activation of certain immunomodulatory cells and by generation of free radicals, the depressed Mn, Zn, Cr and Ni concentrations in BAL from patients may be due to oxidative stress. These preliminary results indicate that assessment of the elemental composition of BAL is a promising approach to study the pathogenesis of diffuse lung diseases and <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis...</b>|$|R

50|$|Clinical and histopathological {{evidence}} {{demonstrate the}} lymphatic involvement in LAM. The prevailing {{hypothesis is that}} LAM lesions secrete the lymphangiogenic factor VEGF-D, recruit lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) that form lymphatic vessels and induce lung cysts. VEGF-D serum levels are increased in LAM compared to other cystic lung diseases, including <b>pulmonary</b> <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis,</b> emphysema, Sjögren's syndrome, or Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome. VEGF-D levels correlate with the severity of LAM, evaluated {{as a measure of}} CT grade (the abundance of chylous effusions and lymphatic involvement). VEGF-D is a secreted homodimeric glycoprotein {{and a member of the}} VEGF family of growth factors, is known for its role in cancer lymphangiogenesis and metastasis. Proteolytic processing of VEGF-D affects cognate binding to VEGFR3. Histopathologically, LAM lesions are surrounded by cells that stain for VEGFR3, the lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1) and podoplanin. VEGF-D binds to the receptor protein tyrosine kinases VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-349 in humans, and to VEGFR3 in mice. Surprisingly, knock-out of VEGF-D in mice has little effect on lymphatic system development. Nevertheless, during tumorigenesis VEGF-D promotes formation of tumor lymphatic vessels and facilitates metastatic spread of cancer cells. However, little is known about a role of abnormal lymphatics and VEGF-D in LAM pathogenesis.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Pulmonary</b> {{involvement}} with <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> (LCH, {{formerly known as}} histiocytosis-X) presents as an interstitial process in children and adults either with or without symptoms. In contrast to other manifestations of LCH, most patients with pulmonary disease are adults. PROCEDURES: We reviewed the literature on pulmonary LCH to determine what were the clinical presentations, prognostic variables, and treatment options for this disease. RESULTS: Although there are spontaneous remissions, {{a large number of}} patients have progressive pulmonary deficiency and experience significant morbidity if not mortality from the disease. The efficacy of steroid versus chemotherapy in halting the process remains controversial, even if smoking is taken into consideration. CONCLUSIONS: A multicenter study of therapy for pulmonary LCH is the obvious answer to this dilemma.

40|$|<b>Pulmonary</b> <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> is an {{uncommon}} diffuse cystic lung disease in adults. In rare cases, it can involve extrapulmonary organs {{and lead to}} endocrine abnormalities such as central diabetes insipidus.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the hypothalamic-pituitary system failed to show the posterior pituitary, which is a typical finding in patients with central diabetes insipidus. This condition was confirmed by a water deprivation test, and the patient was also found to have type 2 diabetes mellitus.

40|$|Objective: <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> is {{an unusual}} {{disorder}} of unknown etiology with heterogeneous clinical behaviors and variable outcomes. It can involve one or more organs or systems, but to our best knowledge, parotid glands involvement in <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> is extremely rare in English literature. Method: We report a 13 -month-old girl who presented with bilateral parotid swelling as presenting symptom. She was misdiagnosed for 4 months, but final diagnosis was multisystem <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis.</b> Result: After being treated for 18 months, the patient acquired complete remission and attained similar growth status to other healthy children. Conclusion: <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> may involve any organ; in patients with parotid enlargement, <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> {{should be kept in}} mind in the differential diagnoses.
