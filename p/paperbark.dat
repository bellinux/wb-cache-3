5|$|The holly-leaved banksia gives {{its name}} to the Banksia ilicifolia {{woodlands}} ('community type 22'), a possibly threatened ecological community found in the Bassendean and Spearwood systems in the central Swan Coastal Plain north of Rockingham. These are low-lying areas which are seasonally waterlogged. The habitat is open woodland and with an open understorey, and such trees as B. ilicifolia, B. attenuata and stout <b>paperbark</b> (Melaleuca preissiana).|$|E
5|$|For {{most of its}} distribution, B.integrifolia occurs {{only within}} about 50 {{kilometres}} (30mi) of the coast, where it typically occurs on poor quality sandy soils derived from sandstone. It grows near coastal cliffs and headlands, alongside river estuaries, and even on stabilised sand dunes. The temperature range for this area is around 0–30°C (30–85°F), with almost no frosts. The species can occur in pure stands, but is usually associated with other species such as Melaleuca quinquenervia (broad-leaved <b>paperbark).</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{occurs in}} a wide variety of habitats, {{including}} riparian woodlands such as river red gum, bimble box and black box with an understory of lignum or saltbush; mallee woodland, especially where mixed with thickets of Broombush or Emu Bush; woodlands of Native Pine growing on sand ridges; and semi-arid scrubland dominated by Acacia including lancewood. On the coast The striped honeyeater is found in swamp forests of <b>paperbark</b> and Casuarina, and in developed areas containing native and exotic trees and shrubs such as caravan parks, reserves, gardens, and farms and orchards.|$|E

50|$|The {{birds are}} found in {{subtropical}} and subtemperate rainforest and <b>paperbarks,</b> and occasionally in adjacent eucalypt forest.|$|R
5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela is occasionally {{found in}} swampy woodlands, casuarina woodlands and open forest, particularly those with Pandanus and <b>paperbarks,</b> {{as well as}} on coconut farms.|$|R
5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{probably}} breeds {{throughout its}} range. The breeding season is from June to January, {{with one or}} two broods raised during this time. The nest is an untidy deep bowl of sticks and bits of bark in the fork of a tree, Staghorn or bird's nest ferns, or grasstree. Pandanus palms are a popular nest site in Mackay. They often renovate and use the old nests of other species, most commonly the grey-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis), but also the chestnut-crowned babbler (P. ruficeps), other honeyeaters including noisy (Philemon corniculatus), little and silver-crowned friarbirds (P. argenticeps), the noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala) and the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), and artamids such as the Australian magpie and butcherbird species, and even the magpie-lark. In Coen, an old babbler nest in a <b>paperbark</b> (Melaleuca) which had been lined with messmate bark had been occupied by blue-faced honeyeaters and re-lined with strips of <b>paperbark.</b> Two or rarely three eggs are laid, 22 × 32mm (1 × 1⅓ in) and buff-pink splotched with red-brown or purplish colours. The female alone incubates the eggs, over a period of 16 or 17 days.|$|E
5|$|The floury {{baker is}} solitary and occurs in low densities. Individuals {{typically}} {{emerge from the}} soil through a three-month period from late November to late February, and can be encountered until May. The floury baker is found {{on a wide variety}} of trees, with some preference for species of <b>paperbark</b> (Melaleuca). It is a relatively poor flier, preyed upon by cicada killer wasps and a wide variety of birds, and can succumb to a cicada-specific fungal disease.|$|E
5|$|Associated {{species in}} the Sydney region include {{heathland}} species such as heath banksia (Banksia ericifolia), coral heath (Epacris microphylla) and mountain devil (Lambertia formosa), and tick bush (Kunzea ambigua) and prickly-leaved <b>paperbark</b> (Melaleuca nodosa) in taller scrub, and under trees such as scribbly gum (Eucalyptus sclerophylla) and narrow-leaved apple (Angophora bakeri) in woodland. The Agnes Banks Woodland in western Sydney has been recognised by the New South Wales Government as an Endangered Ecological Community. Here B.oblongifolia is an understory plant in low open woodland, with scribbly gum, narrow-leaved apple and old man banksia (B.serrata) as canopy trees, and wallum banksia (B.aemula), variable smoke-bush (Conospermum taxifolium), wedding bush (Ricinocarpos pinifolius), showy parrot-pea (Dillwynia sericea) and nodding geebung (Persoonia nutans) as other understory species.|$|E
5|$|They live {{throughout}} rainforest, dry sclerophyll (Eucalyptus) forest, open woodland, Pandanus thickets, <b>paperbarks,</b> mangroves, watercourses, and wetter {{areas of}} semi-arid regions, {{as well as}} parks, gardens, and golf courses in urban areas. The understory in eucalypt-dominated woodland where the blue-faced honeyeater is found is most commonly composed of grasses such as Triodia, but sometimes it {{is made up of}} shrubs or small trees such as grevilleas, <b>paperbarks,</b> wattles, Cooktown ironwood (Erythrophleum chlorostachys) or billygoat plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana). One study in Kakadu National Park found that blue-faced honeyeaters inhabited mixed stands of eucalypts and Pandanus but were missing from pure stands of either plant.|$|R
50|$|Originally home {{to native}} grasses, she-oaks, wattles, <b>paperbarks,</b> and river red gums, the area now {{consists}} of ornamental lakes, sweeping lawns, flowerbeds of annuals, and mature European and Australian {{trees and shrubs}} in a landscaped garden.|$|R

5|$|Individuals {{are usually}} solitary, with a South-East Queensland study {{estimating}} densities of only 50 per hectare (compared {{to some other}} Australian species nearly two orders of magnitude more dense). The adult floury baker normally perches facing downwards and on branches of trees rather than trunks. It is found {{on a wide variety}} of plants, most commonly on species in the family Myrtaceae, more specifically various species of Melaleuca and Callistemon plants, as well as brown hazelwood (Lysicarpus angustifolius) and pegunny (Bauhinia hookeri). These are expected to also be nymphal food plants. The species was associated with white feather honeymyrtle (Melaleuca decora) in a study at three sites in western Sydney. The broad-leaved <b>paperbark</b> has been confirmed as a nymphal food plant.|$|E
5|$|The grey currawong {{is found}} in wet and dry sclerophyll forests across its range, as well as mallee scrubland, and open areas such as parks or {{farmland}} near forested areas. It also inhabits pine plantations. Preferences vary between regions; subspecies versicolor {{is more common in}} wetter forests in southeastern mainland Australia, while the Tasmanian subspecies arguta is found most commonly in lowland dry sclerophyll forest. The subspecies melanoptera and intermedia are found mainly in mallee scrublands and woodlands, while in Western Australia, subspecies plumbea {{is found in}} various forests and woodlands, such as jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), karri (E.diversicolor), tuart (E.gomphocephala) and wandoo (E.wandoo), as well as <b>paperbark</b> woodlands around swampy areas, and acacia shrublands dominated by summer-scented wattle (Acacia rostellifera) and mulga (Acacia aneura) with Eremophila understory.|$|E
5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela mostly inhabits mangroves in monsoonal coastal areas, especially thickets of spotted mangrove (Rhizophora stylosa), smallflower bruguiera (Bruguiera parviflora) and grey mangrove (Avicennia marina) bordering islands or in river deltas, but {{it often}} also occurs in <b>paperbark</b> thickets fringing the mangroves {{such as those}} of cajeput (Melaleuca leucadendra). It is a mangrove specialist, an adaptation that probably occurred as northern Australia became more arid and the bird populations became dependent on mangroves as other types of forest disappeared. The mangroves provide nectar and insects as well as shelter and nesting sites, and they supply the majority of the species' needs for most of the year. In Australia, mangrove vegetation forms a narrow discontinuous strip along thousands of kilometres of coastline, accommodating birds specialized for the habitat. Eighty Mile Beach in Western Australia has no mangroves and no fringing Melaleuca forests, reducing its potential for successful colonization by nectarivores, and it marks the southern limit of the red-headed myzomela in Western Australia.|$|E
50|$|While {{the forest}} is {{dominated}} by Eucalyptus deanei, other eucalyptus trees are present. Smaller trees and shrubs include <b>paperbarks</b> (Melaleuca styphelioides), various acacias and the Yellow Pittosporum (Pittosporum revolutum). Grasses, vines, orchids (Caladenia picta), and ferns grow on the forest floor.|$|R
50|$|The {{aquatic flora}} of the estuary are {{dominated}} by the small green algae Polyphysa peniculus the stonewort Lamprothamnium papulosum and the seagrass Ruppia megacarpa.The waterbody of the inlet is fringed with Salt Water <b>Paperbarks</b> with sedges and samphire common along the sandy sections.|$|R
50|$|The Arafura Swamp {{contains}} 25 distinct plant communities, {{with over}} 100 species of grasses, herbs, aquatics, sedges and trees recorded. Most {{of the swamp}} is covered by low forest and woodland over grassland, with the dominant tree species being the <b>paperbarks</b> Melaleuca cajuputi and Melaleuca leucadendra.|$|R
5|$|After hatching, the nymphs {{fall from}} the {{branches}} to seek {{a crack in the}} soil where they can burrow, often to a depth of 10–40cm (4–16in), by digging with their large forelegs. Larger species of cicada like A.curvicosta are thought to spend 2–8 years underground, during which time they grow and feed through their rostrum on the sap from tree roots. They moult five times before emerging from the ground to shed their final shell. Although consistently taking place at night, the emergence of the population is diffusely spread over the season in comparison to the more high-density Australian species. The sex ratio is about 1.15males to every female, consistent throughout the emergence. The metabolic rate over a period of about 6.5hours during emergence of A.curvicosta is about 1.8times the resting metabolic rate of the adult. A South East Queensland study reported nymphs would emerge on most tree species but avoid Norfolk pine (Araucaria heterophylla) and broad-leaved <b>paperbark</b> (Melaleuca quinquenervia). The adults are usually found between November and May but are sometimes observed as early as September and until as late as June. They were recorded as appearing every year, mainly in December and January in western Sydney, with a similar 92-day emergence period from late November until late February recorded in South East Queensland. This makes it one of the last Australian cicadas to emerge each season. The nymph grips onto the tree bark with all of its legs, swallows air and redistributes haemolymph to split the cast down the center of its back. It then extracts its head and clypeus by hunching its body, and when these have emerged, arches back to draw the legs out of their casing. It then slowly unfolds its wings, finally bending forward and gripping onto the front of the shell to free its abdomen. Once free it hangs for hours more as the wings harden.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, {{below the}} {{altitude}} of , two Melaleuca species, dryland tea tree and swamp <b>paperbark,</b> are present as thickets {{with the former}} species being reported as the “most widespread” of the two species.|$|E
25|$|Other {{components}} of their diet include soursop fruit, sugar-apples, banana fruits, leaves, and flowers, traveller's palm flowers, giant white bird of paradise flowers, pitahaya fruit, Indian-almond fruit, Java apple fruit and flowers, guava fruit, weeping <b>paperbark</b> flowers, Albany bottlebrush flowers, litchi fruit, key lime fruits, Meyer lemons, pomelos, grapefruit, amanatsu fruit, sweet oranges, tangerines, mangos, figs, and Chinese mulberries.|$|E
50|$|The river flows freely {{through the}} gorge during the wet season {{but during the}} dry season (between May and September) it becomes a series of pools {{surrounded}} by trees and shrubs. Some of the vegetation found along the river banks include <b>paperbarks,</b> cadjebuts, native fig trees and leichhardt trees.|$|R
50|$|Vegetation {{across the}} {{catchment}} area is speargrass savannah dominated by Stringybark, Bloodwoods and Moreton Bay Ash. Along the river banks and tributaries there are open stands of <b>paperbarks</b> and dense riparian rainforest. The season swamps and lagoons have Melaleucas and Freshwater Mangrove with water lilies in standing water.|$|R
50|$|Native trees such as <b>Paperbarks,</b> She-oaks and Bottlebrush {{have been}} {{recently}} planted. Bunya Pines (Araucaria bidwillii) were {{once in the}} reserve, until they were dilapidated. Furthermore, some of the trees have sustained damages in their branches and trunks. Pine logs and wharf timbers are used to enclose the car park space.|$|R
25|$|The monarchs are {{a diverse}} family of {{passerine}} birds that are generally arboreal (with {{the exception of}} the magpie-larks). They are mostly slim birds and possess broad bills. The bills of some species are quite large and the heavy-set bills of the shrikebills are used to probe dead wood and leaves. The plumage of the family ranges from sombre, such as the almost monochrome black monarch, to spectacular, as displayed by the golden monarch. The tails are generally long and spectacularly so in the paradise flycatchers in the genus Terpsiphone. Sexual dimorphism in plumage can be subtle, as in the <b>paperbark</b> flycatcher, where the female is identical to the male except for a slight buff on the throat; striking, as in the Chuuk monarch where the male almost entirely white and the female entirely black; or non-existent, as in the Tahiti monarch. In some species, for example the Malagasy paradise flycatcher, the males have two or more colour morphs.|$|E
500|$|Lambertia formosa {{grows in}} heathland, mallee shrubland and dry sclerophyll forest, {{predominantly}} found on sandy or rocky soils. Associated heathland species include dwarf apple (Angophora hispida), <b>paperbark</b> teatree (Leptospermum trinervium), rusty banksia (Banksia oblongifolia) and heath banksia (Banksia ericifolia), while woodland trees include silvertop ash (Eucalyptus sieberi), smooth-barked apple (Angophora costata), [...] narrow-leaved apple (A. bakeri), red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera), yellow bloodwood (C. eximia), scribbly gum (Eucalyptus sclerophylla), and Sydney peppermint (E. piperita). One heathland community located between Lake Munmorah and Redhead grows {{at least partly}} on clayey soils. Here, L. formosa grows under mallee forms of brown stringybark (Eucalyptus capitellata) and broad-leaved white mahogany (E. umbra) and alongside shrubby forms of prickly-leaved <b>paperbark</b> (Melaleuca nodosa), dagger hakea (Hakea teretifolia), scrub she-oak (Allocasuarina distyla), rusty banksia and swathes of kangaroo grass (Themeda triandra).|$|E
500|$|The [...] Australind Bypass was {{constructed}} in the 1980s to relieve pressure on Old Coast Road, [...] and improve local amenity. The bypass travelled {{to the east and}} south of Australind and Eaton, to connect to Bunbury's Eelup Roundabout via an alignment previously part of Jubilee Road. There were slight deviations in the route to protect remnant <b>paperbark</b> trees, tuarts, acacia, and aquatic plants, as well as a site of aboriginal importance, identified by botanical and aboriginal heritage surveys. Australind Bypass was built in two stages by the Bunbury Division of Main Roads. The first stage opened on 11 December 1987, and was a [...] length from Eelup Roundabout to Eaton Drive, plus a [...] link from the bypass (north of the rail line) and the Collie River bridge on Old Coast Road. Stage two, the remaining [...] to reconnect with Old Coast Road, was completed ahead of schedule in December 1998.|$|E
50|$|The swamps support sedgeland, tall open shrubland and low open forest or woodland. The sedgeland is {{dominated}} by Baumea articulate, B. juncea, Typha spp. and Lepidosperma spp. Schoenoplectus validus, Isolepis nodosa and Juncus kraussii also occur. The forest and woodland {{is dominated}} by the <b>paperbarks</b> Melaleuca rhaphiophylla, M. hamulosa, M. cuticularis and M. teretifolia. Surrounding areas support open heathland.|$|R
5000|$|On the {{sandstone}} hills are spinifex, acacias, eucalypts and grevilleas. Growing {{on the river}} plains are western bloodwoods and mitchell grass. [...] <b>Paperbarks,</b> river red gums, figs, ferns, pandanus and cabbage palms are found along the creek and river banks. A diverse range of aquatic plants such as waterlilies, ferns, mosses, sedges and bulrushes grow in the creeks.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} principally {{distributed}} in mangrove forests and in forests and woodland adjacent to mangroves. The species will move into nearby forests from mangroves to feed, {{particularly in the}} breeding season. Where its range overlaps {{with that of the}} large-billed gerygone in the Kimberley it is actually displaced from the mangroves and is instead found in scrubland dominated by <b>paperbarks</b> and acacia.|$|R

50|$|Millbridge is {{currently}} dependent on neighbouring Eaton for shopping, education and recreation, {{although it is}} envisaged by the developer that two schools, a neighbourhood shopping centre and commercial precinct will be built. The suburb contains a mix of jarrah, marri, sheoak and banksia woodland as well as wetland areas with flooded gums and <b>paperbarks,</b> which provide habitat {{to a wide range}} of waterbirds and mammals.|$|R
