25|$|Air <b>pollutant</b> <b>emission</b> {{factors are}} {{reported}} representative values {{that attempt to}} relate the quantity of a pollutant released to the ambient air with an activity associated {{with the release of}} that pollutant. These factors are usually expressed as the weight of pollutant divided by a unit weight, volume, distance, or duration of the activity emitting the pollutant (e.g., kilograms of particulate emitted per tonne of coal burned). Such factors facilitate estimation of emissions from various sources of air pollution. In most cases, these factors are simply averages of all available data of acceptable quality, and are generally assumed to be representative of long-term averages.|$|E

The rise in air transport activity {{has been accompanied}} by an increase in the amount of energy used to provide air transportation services. It is also assumed to increase environmental impacts, in particular <b>pollutant</b> <b>emissions.</b> Traditionally, the environmental impacts of atmospheric emissions from aircraft have been addressed in two separate ways; aircraft <b>pollutant</b> <b>emissions</b> occurring during the landing and take-off (LTO) phase (local <b>pollutant</b> <b>emissions)</b> which is the focus of this study, and the non-LTO phase (global/regional <b>pollutant</b> <b>emissions).</b> Aircraft <b>pollutant</b> <b>emissions</b> are an important source of pollution and directly or indirectly harmfully affect human health, ecosystems and cultural heritage. There are many methods to asses <b>pollutant</b> <b>emissions</b> used by various countries. However, using different and separate methodology will cause a variation in results, some lack of information and the use of certain methods will require justification and reliability that must be demonstrated and proven. In relation to this issue, this paper presents identification, comparison and reviews of some of the methodologies of aircraft pollutant assessment from the past, present and future expectations of some studies and projects focusing on emissions factors, fuel consumption, and uncertainty.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the issue of}} air <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> for the optimal and sustainable determination of cordon location, toll level, and price of park and ride (P&R). Although air <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> decreases within the cordon by the implementation of cordon pricing scheme, it may increase outside the cordon and the whole network. Hence, air <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> may only transfer from inside of the cordon to its outside. Therefore, in this paper, a multi-objective bi-level optimization model is developed. A solution algorithm is also presented based on the second version of strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA 2). The results reveal that this multi-objective model can be {{a useful tool for}} the sustainable and optimal design of the cordon and P&R scheme. In addition, cordon pricing is a multi-objective problem. Therefore, it is necessary to consider air <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission.</b> By choosing another non-dominated result in the solution space, air <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> outside the cordon and the whole network can be reduced without a significant reduction in social welfare...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV), the {{electrical}} hybridization offers {{different ways to}} reduce the fuel consumption: kinetic energy recuperation during vehicle deceleration, possibility of stopping the engine, and intelligent Energy Management System (EMS). Besides, with the future more stringent standards, {{there is a need to}} integrate the <b>pollutant</b> <b>emissions</b> in the EMS, since strictly reducing the fuel consumption can increase the emissions. The paper presents an optimal energy management strategy with constraints on <b>pollutant</b> <b>emissions</b> for gasoline-HEV, taking into account the 3 -Way Catalyst Converter (3 WCC). Based on a complete model of the powertrain, a mixed fuel consumption / <b>pollutant</b> <b>emissions</b> performance index is minimized with the Pontryaguin Minimum Principle (PMP) and two states, the battery State Of Charge and the 3 WCC temperature.

40|$|Meeting Theme: Powering Up the Next GenerationWith {{the haze}} weather {{happening}} more frequently especially in developing countries, {{the air quality}} problem is attracting increasing attention. As {{a major source of}} air <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission,</b> the electricity industry is expected to conduct environmental-friendly power system planning and operation. Traditionally, the total <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> is considered. However, it is well identified that the geographical distribution of <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> is a significant factor determining the influence of pollutants. In this work, geographical location of power plants and loads, and meteorological conditions are considered to obtain the geographical distribution information of <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission.</b> A prototype production costing model with air quality constraints is built, which can be employed to aid generation expansion planning, fuel budgeting and system operation. Case studies are conducted on a system with both traditional generations and renewable generations, to reveal the cost of geographical consideration of pollutants. © 2015 IEEE.

30|$|Compared the {{contribution}} of various electricity generation technologies to the medium power demand, it presents that different electricity conversion technologies have various generation quantities under changed pollutants emission- cutting scenarios. As the above analysis, in the respect of energy type, coal-fired electricity would be the mainly power supply source under 0 % <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> reduction. Natural gas-fired electricity conversion technology would {{play a key role}} in the power generation activities, coal-fired power would be in a second place and wind power would be the supplement under 10 % and 20 % <b>pollutants</b> <b>emissions</b> reduction. This is because coal-fired electricity conversion technology has comparatively low operating and penalty costs and relatively low capital cost for capacity expansion, and the related cost of natural gas-fired electricity conversion technology is a little higher than coal-fired power and the <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> from natural gas-fired power generation process is smaller relatively. The maximum optimized wind power generation would be 0.5 GWh in April, July and October, due to the relatively higher operating cost and capital cost for its storage, which limits the development of wind power. The dominant role of coal-fired electricity would be displaced by some other conversion technologies with an increased demand for <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> reduction. For example, under 20 % <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> reduction, the optimized coal-fired power target would decrease to [39.94, 46.20] GWh in January; although fuel-fired power would decrease, the optimized targets of wind power would have a growth and play an important role to meet electricity demand. It indicates that environment-friendly electricity conversion technologies should better serve interests of the <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> reduction and be chosen for power generation to meet the ever-increasing electricity demands and gradually enhancing <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> reduction requirements. These are optimized conclusions in terms of pollutants emission-cutting; from view point of energy saving, CHP would be properly adopted in electricity and heat generation progress.|$|R
