5000|$|General {{consensus}} {{for care}} advises against removing the flakes or scab that may form {{on a new}} tattoo, and avoiding exposing one's tattoo to the sun for extended periods for at least 3 weeks; both of these can contribute to fading of the image. It is agreed that a new tattoo needs to be kept clean. Various products may be recommended for application to the skin, ranging from those intended {{for the treatment of}} cuts, burns and scrapes, to <b>panthenol,</b> cocoa butter, A&D, hemp, lanolin, or salves. Oil based ointments are almost always recommended for use on very thin layers due to their inability to evaporate and therefore over-hydrate the already perforated skin. Recent scientific studies have demonstrated that wounds that are kept moist heal faster than wounds healing under dry conditions. [...] In recent years specific commercial products have been developed for tattoo aftercare. Although opinions about these products vary, soap and warm water work well to keep a tattoo clean and free from infection.|$|E

40|$|Background : The B {{vitamins}} niacinamide and <b>panthenol</b> {{have been}} shown to reduce many signs of skin aging, including hyperpigmentation and redness. Aims : To measure the facial skin effects in Indian women of the daily use of a lotion containing niacinamide, <b>panthenol,</b> and tocopherol acetate using quantitative image analysis. Methods : Adult women 30 - 60 years of age with epidermal hyperpigmentation were recruited in Mumbai and randomly assigned to apply a test or control lotion to the face daily for 10 weeks. Effects on skin tone were measured using an image capturing system and associated software. Skin texture was assessed by expert graders. Barrier function was evaluated by transepithelial water loss measurements. Subjects and evaluators were blinded to the product assignment. Results : Of 246 women randomized to treatment, 207 (84 &#x 0025;) completed the study. Women who used the test lotion experienced significantly reduced appearance of hyperpigmentation, improved skin tone evenness, appearance of lightening of skin, and positive effects on skin texture. Improvements versus control were seen as early as 6 weeks. The test lotion was well tolerated. The most common adverse event was a transient, mild burning sensation.

40|$|The {{etiology}} of Alopecia areata {{has not been}} cleared as yet. As possible etiologic factors have been m entioned: a blow a that particular site, psychic trauma, family disposition etc. Poor condition of the teeth as an » irritating factor« is also listed among the etiologic factors. Therapy of Alopecia areata is different and depends on individual symptoms. As {{one of the more}} difficient methods, treatment with corticosteroids has been mentioned, or in combination with sexual hormones, pantothenic acid etc. This method of therapy has yielded satisfactory results in a number of patients. Two cases suffering from Alopecia areata are described where apart from application of local therapeutic agents, corticosteriods (Ultralan) and pantothenic acid (<b>Panthenol),</b> treatment and extraction of the diseased deciduous teeth was carried out. The grow th of new hair with in 3 — 10 days after the removal of the diseased teeth, and possibly the absence of other etiologic factors prompted the authors to consider the possibiIity of alopecia areata to bee in connection with diseased deciduous teeth in these two cases. Die Ursache der Alopecia areata ist noch nicht geklart. Unter verschiedenen ursachlichen Faktoren muss man auch kranke Zahne in Betracht ziehen. Zur zeitgemassen Therapie verwendet man Corticosteriode, allein oder in kombination mit Geschlechtshormonen, Panthotensaure, andere. Bei vielen Patienten konnten dam it befriedigende Resultate erzielt werden. Es werden zwei Falle von Alopecia areata beschrieben, wo neben lokaler Anwendung von Corticosteroiden (Ultralan) und Panthotensaure (<b>Panthenol)</b> die Extraktion von kranken Milchzahnen ausgefuhrt wurde. Frischer Haarnachwuchs 3 bis 10 Tage nach der Extraktion der kranken Zahne, die Abwesenheit anderer aethiologischen Faktoren, gibt Anlass anzunehmen, dass die Alopecia areata in diesen zwei Fallen durch kranke Zahne bedingt war. Etiologija alopecije areate je nerazjašnjena. Kao mogući etiološki faktori navode se: udar na dotičnom mestu, psihička trauma, familijarna dispozicija i dr. Loše stanje zuba kao »iritativni faktor« također se ubraja u etiološke faktore. Terapija alopecije areate je različita i zavisi od individualnih simptoma. Kao jedna od efikasnijih metoda spominje se ona s kortikosteroidima, ili u kombinaciji s pastama polnih hormona, psoralensima, pantotenskom kiselinom i dr. Ovim načinom terapije postignuti su zadovoljavajući rezultati kod većeg broja pacijenata. Opisana su dva slučaja sa alopecijom areatom, gde je pored primene lokalnih terapeutskih sredstava kortikosteroida (Ultralan) i pantotenske kiseline (Pantenol), izvršena sanacija i ekstrakcija bolesnih mlečnih zuba. Nicanje nove kose za vreme od 3 — 10 dana posle ekstrakcije obolelih zuba, verovatno odsustvo drugih etioloških faktora, orijentirala je autore na mogućnost da bi alopecija u ova dva slučaja mogla biti posledica bolesnih mlečnih zuba...|$|E
40|$|Considering {{the belief}} that natural lipids and edible {{substances}} are safer for topical applications and that carotenoids are able to protect cells against photooxidative damage, wea have investigated whether topical creams and lotions, produced with Buriti oil and commercial surfactants, can exert photoprotective effect of against UVA and UVB irradiation. Emulsions and plain Buriti oil were diluted in DMEM medium supplemented with 10 % FBS. Cell treatment was divided in two stages, prior and after being exposed to 30 minutes of UVA plus UVB radiation or 60 minutes to UVA radiation. Emulsions prepared with ethoxylated fatty alcohols as surfactants and containing α-tocopherol caused phototoxic damage to the cells, especially when applied prior to UV exposure. Damage reported was due to prooxidant activity and phototoxic effect of the surfactant. Emulsions prepared with Sorbitan Monooleate and PEG- 40 castor oil and containing <b>panthenol</b> as active ingredient, were able to reduce the damages caused by radiation when compared to non-treated cells.

30|$|The {{classification}} and labelling {{of personal}} care products was derived by application of the criteria given in the CLP Regulation. Bridging principles were not relevant as no information about comparable cosmetic products tested and classified as mixtures was available. 41 cosmetic products were selected {{from a wide range}} of product groups (e.g. [27, 28]): baby skin product (2), after shave (2), shaving cream, deodorant (4), toothpaste (2), shampoo (2), hand and body lotion, shower gel, liquid soap and syndet, eye zone cream, massage oil, carotene skincare gel, all purpose cream, basic cream, hand cream, emulsion with <b>panthenol,</b> massage oil, hair spray (2), oxidative hair dye formula, bleaching lotion, depilatory cream, cold wave solution, mascara (2), lipstick (2), face make up remover, nail glue, perfume, alcohol free cologne, insect repellent (2). The number of ingredients ranged from 41 (perfume) to a single one (nail glue). The formulas are basic recipes for standard products and correspond to lists of ingredients of products in German retail shops and cosmetic frame formulations [8]. The present selection of products is meant to illustrate the situation with some examples and it is not meant to be complete nor representative. The information on properties necessary for {{classification and labelling}} of all ingredients were compiled from data accessible to the general public. Preferentially harmonized classifications were used in the current C&L Inventory [9]. The classifications of substances registered according to REACH were compared with the classifications in the C&L Inventory. Most substances which are used more or less exclusively in cosmetics have not been registered according to REACH, whereas cosmetic ingredients used also in other applications like e.g. glycerol, hydrogen peroxide, isododecane, isopropanol, or phosphoric acid are registered. The recently installed cosmetic products notification portal according to the Cosmetics Regulation 1223 / 2009 [6] is not open for the general public and could not be used.
