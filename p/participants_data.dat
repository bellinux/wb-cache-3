Our primary outcome, overall survival, was defi ned as the time from randomisation until death (any cause), with living patients censored on the date of last follow-up. Secondary outcomes were recurrence-free survival, time to locoregional and distant recurrence, cause-specifi c survival, complete and overall resection rates, and postoperative mortality.

No participants showed preference for the LQ stimuli when compared singly or in a varied arrangement to the HQ stimulus.

Results of Study 2 were mixed. One <b>participant’s</b> <b>data</b> indicated that the varied presentation of NP stimuli produced a modest improvement in performance over that observed when the stimuli were presented singly. By contrast, a second <b>participant’s</b> <b>data</b> showed no facilitative effect for the varied delivery of NP stimuli and that the inclusion of an HQ stimulus in the varied arrangement obscured the reinforcing effects of the HQ stimulus.

The second approach imputed missing <b>participant</b> <b>data</b> relative to those with complete data in the same trial arm, assuming that those missing in the intervention arm had an increased event incidence of 1.5 compared to those followed up, and the control arm the same event incidence (1.0) in those with complete and missing data. We additionally performed further sensitivity analyses excluding those trials assessed at high risk of bias for missing outcome data and those published in only abstract form or as a doctoral thesis.|$|R
