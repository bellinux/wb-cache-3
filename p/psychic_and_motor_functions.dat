However, {{the relationship between these}} variables is controversial. Objective To investigate the relationship between {{muscle strength}} <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> <b>and</b> between these variables and age. Method Muscle strength was measured by Medical Research Council (MRC) scale <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> <b>function,</b> by <b>Motor</b> <b>Function</b> Measure (MFM), in 40 non-ambulatory patients. Spearman tests investigated the relationships between muscle strength, <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> <b>and</b> age. Results Total MRC and MFM scores were strongly related to each other (r = 0. 94; p 0. 05). Strong and moderate relationships between partial muscle strength <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> scores were found. Higher correlation coefficients were found between total scores and Dimensions 2 (axial/ proximal control) and 3 (distal control) of MFM. Conclusion Muscle strength <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> are strongly correlated and seem to decrease proportionally in DMD...|$|R

METHODS: The Mental <b>and</b> <b>Motor</b> Scales of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-Second Edition (BSID-II) were administered. SUBJECTS: Seventy-eight toddlers with CP (mean age 2 years 7 months, SD 1 month; 43 boys, Gross <b>Motor</b> <b>Function</b> Classification System (GMFCS) levels I-V). RESULTS: Spearman correlation coefficient between mental <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> <b>functioning</b> was 0. 67 (p < 0. 01). Sixty-five percent (51 / 78) of the children performed {{at the same level}} in mental <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> <b>functioning,</b> of whom 36 performed significantly delayed and 15 within normal limits. Thirty-five percent of the children were more delayed in <b>motor</b> <b>functioning</b> than in mental functioning. CONCLUSION: In toddlers with CP, an association was found between mental <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> <b>functioning.</b> When <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> mental <b>functioning</b> did not develop synchronously, it was always in favour of mental functioning. This study emphasizes the importance of examining both mental <b>functioning</b> <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> <b>functioning</b> separately of pre-school children with CP...|$|R
40|$|Mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (mTBI) causes deficits in <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> cognitive <b>function.</b> There is a dearth of research examining the association between these deficits. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to examine the effect of mTBI on the association between cognitive <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> <b>function.</b> Thirty-six individuals completed a neurocognitive test battery and postural control assessment at baseline and were retested 24 -h post mTBI. Reaction time and accuracy to various cognitive tasks was assessed. Postural control was indexed with the somatosenory organization test. This test allows for the decomposition of postural control resulting from the integration of visual, somatosensory and vestibular information. The association between cognitive <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> was assessed with correlational analyses. Overall, it was found that mTBI resulted in increased simple and choice reaction time as well as deficits in verbal and visual memory. mTBI was also found to reduce overall postural control, especially when visual information was utilized. Prior to injury there was no association between cognitive <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> function—indicating minimal association between cognitive <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> <b>function.</b> After injury there were significant positive correlations between cognitive <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> <b>function.</b> The findings suggest that transient neural insults resulting from mTBI lead to increased cognitive-motor association. It is speculated that a shared neural process, such as visuospatial attention is damaged resulting in similar deficits in cognitive <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> <b>function...</b>|$|R

The present study was aimed to compare the effect of aquatic and land-based exercise methods on the pain level <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> of the weight lifters with patellofemoral syndrome. Methods: A total of twenty weight lifters with patellofemoral syndrome participated in this quasi-experimental study. They were randomly divided to two groups of aquatic exercise and land-based exercise. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Kujala Scale were used before and after the exercise period to measure the pain <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> <b>function,</b> respectively. To compare the pre-test and post-test scores of the participating groups, dependent t-test was used and to compare the differences between groups, ANOVA was applied. Results: The results of post-test showed a significant difference in both groups in terms of pain level <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> compared to pre-test after eight weeks of strength exercise. However, the comparison of data indicated no significant difference between groups with regard to pain level <b>and</b> <b>motor</b> <b>function.</b> Conclusion: According to the findings of this study, exercise in water and on land can reduce the pain and improve the performance of the patients with patellofemoral syndrome...|$|R

40|$|Background: In children, {{reaching}} emerges {{around four}} months of age, which is followed by rapid changes in hand function and concomitant changes in gross <b>motor</b> <b>function,</b> including the acquisition of independent sitting. Although there is a close functional relationship between these domains, to date they have been investigated separately. Objective: To investigate the longitudinal profile of changes {{and the relationship between}} the development of hand function (i. e. reaching for and manipulating an object) <b>and</b> gross <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> in 13 normally developing children born at term who were evaluated every 15 days from 4 to 8 months of age. Method: The number of reaches and the period (i. e. time) of manipulation to an object were extracted from video synchronized with the Qualisys(r) movement analysis system. Gross <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> was measured using the Alberta Infant Motor Scale. ANOVA for repeated measures was used to test the effect of age on the number of reaches, the time of manipulation <b>and</b> gross <b>motor</b> <b>function.</b> Hierarchical regression models were used to test the associations of reaching and manipulation with gross <b>motor</b> <b>function.</b> Results: Results revealed {{a significant increase in the}} number of reaches (p< 0. 001), the time of manipulation (p< 0. 001) <b>and</b> gross <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> (p< 0. 001) over time, as well as associations between reaching <b>and</b> gross <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> (R 2 = 0. 84; p< 0. 001) and manipulation <b>and</b> gross <b>motor</b> <b>function</b> (R 2 = 0. 13; p= 0. 02) from 4 to 6 months of age.

Stratified analysis showed that an increase in CES-D scores led to a larger decline of cognitive test results in participants with mild to moderate depressive symptoms, compared to those with a high degree of depressive symptoms.

40|$|The Comprehensive Trail-Making Test (CTMT) is a {{commonly}} used assessment tool {{shown to be}} sensitive to brain dysfunction. Research has found cognitive abilities such as possessing speed, working memory, motor speed, sustained attention, and cognitive flexibility influence performance on the CTMT in non-clinical populations. However, little research has been done to examine the neurocognitive abilities that influence performance on the CTMT in clinical populations. Research has demonstrated that the factor structure of the CTMT differs between clinical and non-clinical groups, which supports the need for further validation of the CTMT in clinical populations. This study examines the neurocognitive correlates that are thought to underlie performance on factor scores of the CTMT in children that with brain dysfunction. The sample for the current study consisted of 98 children, with various sustained and developmental and neurological disorders and a subgroup of children with a TBI (n = 71) selected from the overall sample. These children completed a neuropsychological battery, which included the CTMT and measures of possessing speed, working memory, <b>motor</b> speed, <b>and</b> sustained attention. The relationship between the neurocognitive correlates and the CTMT factor scores were examined using a regression analysis. It was hypothesized that the simple sequencing factor would be predicted by tests that assess Processing Speed,Sustained Attention <b>and</b> <b>Motor</b> <b>Function,</b> while the complex sequencing factor would be predicted by Processing speed and Working Memory. Results indicate that Processing Speed <b>and</b> <b>Motor</b> <b>Function</b> were significant predictors for both the Simple and Complex Sequencing factors. In addition to Processing Speed <b>and</b> <b>Motor</b> <b>Function,</b> Working Memory was a significant predictor for Complex Sequencing for the overall sample. In contrast, Sustained Attention, along with Processing Speed <b>and</b> <b>Motor</b> <b>Function,</b> significantly predicted Complex Sequencing for the TBI subgroup.
