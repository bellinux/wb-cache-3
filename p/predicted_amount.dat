500|$|Voice {{acting in}} Tempest was {{restricted}} to battles. Dissatisfied with this approach, the developers wanted to have full voice acting for Innocence while keeping as many planned features in the game as possible. After some trial and error, and {{on the verge of}} scrapping voice acting altogether, the team used CRI Middleware's Kyuseishu Sound Streamer compression algorithm to fit the voice acting into the game alongside the other features. The team first learned of the algorithm in May 2006, when the first prototype of Innocence had already been built. The inclusion of the algorithm forced the team to scrap elements of the first build and restart development. The new prototype was completed in November 2006. The <b>predicted</b> <b>amount</b> of voice recording was estimated at 120 minutes. The final product included 40 minutes more than that. According to Ōdate, approximately 70-80% percent of the main scenario was voiced, {{with the rest of the}} game's dialogue using text due to hardware limitations. The voice work took up one gigabit of storage space on the DS card. For Innocence R, the voice acting was re-recorded, with the entire main scenario being voiced. This enabled minor changes to character portrayals, as in the case of Kimura when she was redoing Luca's lines: according to her, she worked to inject a little more energy into Luca's voice. For the two new characters, the team created a fictional language called the [...] "Triverse Language", which the characters' actors sometimes had trouble speaking.|$|E

5000|$|Research {{carried out}} in 2008 in the Siberian Arctic has shown {{millions}} of tons of methane being released, apparently through perforations in the seabed permafrost, with concentrations in some regions reaching up to 100 times normal levels.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{discusses}} {{a method}} of compression mass gauge based on adiabatic compression {{and the effects of}} the uncertainty in the parameters’ measurement on the <b>predicted</b> <b>amount</b> of propellant.

It is important to study {{the extent to which the}} uncertainty in various instruments and other measured parameters affecting the <b>predicted</b> <b>amount</b> of propellant. With Monte Carlo simulation, it is found that the accuracy with which the propellant quantity can be estimated is highly sensitive to the precision of the tank volume measurement if all parameters’ uncertainty varied from 0 ∼ 1 % of full scale.

The behaviour of 14 pesticides plus 1 metabolite was investigated mainly on loamy sand soils at four different locations in Germany. In three lysimeter studies a silty loam soil was used.
