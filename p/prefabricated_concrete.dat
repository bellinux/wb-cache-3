25|$|It is {{not known}} for sure which Party leader {{personally}} initiated the drive to reduce costs. The need was imminent. What is known is that in January 1951, Khrushchev – then City of Moscow party boss – hosted a professional conference on construction problems. The conference decreed a transition to plant-made, large-sized concrete parts, building new plants for <b>prefabricated</b> <b>concrete</b> and other materials, and replacement of wet masonry technology with fast assembly of prefabricated elements. The industry still had to decide – should they use big, story-high panels, or smaller ones, or maybe two-story panels, as Lagutenko tried in Kuzminki? Basic technology was set, feasibility studies continued. A year later, this line of action – establishing <b>prefabricated</b> <b>concrete</b> plants – was made a law by the XIX Party Congress, Stalin attending. Major public buildings and elite housing were not affected yet.|$|E
25|$|Located on {{a narrow}} plot in a {{suburban}} setting, the building itself is narrow, and has an austere façade which encloses the various rooms {{and a number of}} small courtyards. Surrounded by birch trees, the exterior walls are faced with white <b>prefabricated</b> <b>concrete</b> panels and white glazed tiles. The aluminium roof gives the church a rather industrial look. Glass sections provide lighting over the connecting corridors. Covering an area of 1,700 square meters, the tight geometrical plan consists of three sections and a courtyard between two parallel corridors.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} type of experiment concerned the improvement of project management, switching from a single-building to a multi-block project scale. This was tested in the Peschanaya Square development (a territory north from the 1948 Posokhin-Lagutenko block). Using the flow methode of moving crews through a sequence of buildings in different completion stages and a moderate application of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>concrete</b> on otherwise traditional masonry, builders managed to complete typical 7-story buildings in 5–6 months. Instead of wet-stucco (which caused at least two months of delay), these buildings are finished with open brickwork outside, and a drywall inside; and from a quality of life consideration, these are true – and the last – Stalinist buildings.|$|E

40|$|The diploma work {{focuses on}} the concept of a new <b>prefabricated</b> {{reinforced}} <b>concrete</b> roof element for shed roofs. The diploma work consists of three parts. The first part presents general demands that need {{to be taken into account}} when building industrial facilities. Also presented are shed roof system designs and prefabricated construction designs. For each of the two strengths and weaknesses are shown. Also exposed are some shed roof structural problems. In the second part recent shed roof system designs are presented. Strengths and weaknesses of the existing gable roof system are compared to the newly designed shed system element. In this part we also set goals and determine the static design conditions as also provision of microclimate conditions, which the new <b>prefabricated</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> roof element for shed roofs must satisfy. The third part of the diploma work presents the chosen <b>prefabricated</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> roof element for shed roof construction. Design solutions are proposed to meet the set conditions from the following aspects: ensuring sufficient daylight in the space, heat isolation, stormwater drainage as also fixing the element on the construction. This last part of the diploma work is completed with a static calculation and a calculation of armature for a new <b>prefabricated</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> roof element of 10 m in length. The given data is provided for a real and concrete location where the newly designed element could be used and the calculation is only valid for this location...|$|R
25|$|In 1947, {{engineer}} Vitaly Lagutenko {{was appointed}} to direct the experimental Industrial Construction Bureau, with an objective to study and design the low-cost technology suitable for fast mass construction. Lagutenko emphasized large <b>prefabricated</b> <b>concrete</b> panes. He joined architects Mikhail Posokhin (senior) and Ashot Mndoyants, and in 1948 this team built their first concrete frame-and-panel building near present-day Polezhaevskaya metro station. Four identical buildings followed nearby; similar buildings were built during 1949–1952 across the country. This was still an experiment, not backed by industrial capacity or fast-track project schedules. Posokhin also devised various pseudo-Stalinist configurations of the same building blocks, with decorative excesses; these were not implemented. Concrete frames became common for industrial construction, but too expensive for mass housing.|$|E
