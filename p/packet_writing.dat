In Windows Vista, <b>Packet</b> <b>writing</b> (incremental writing) {{is supported by}} UDFS, which can now format and write to all mainstream optical media formats (MO, CDR/RW, DVD+R/RW, DVD-R/RW/RAM).

In this way, CD-R can emulate CD-RW; however, each time information on the disc is altered, more data has to be written to the disc. There can be compatibility issues with this format and some CD drives.|$|E

50|$|<b>Packet</b> <b>writing</b> {{allows users}} to create, modify, and delete files and {{directories}} on demand without the need to burn a whole disc. <b>Packet</b> <b>writing</b> technology achieves this by writing data in incremental blocks {{rather than in a}} single block.|$|E

This technical assistance <b>packet,</b> <b>written</b> by P/PV and published by the National Mentoring Center at the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory, describes the significant obstacles confronting lesbian and gay youth.

50|$|<b>Packet</b> <b>writing</b> is {{a scheme}} {{in which the}} {{recorder}} writes incrementally to disc in short bursts, or packets. Sequential <b>packet</b> <b>writing</b> fills the disc with packets from bottom up. To make it readable in CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives, the disc can be closed at any time by writing a final table-of-contents {{to the start of}} the disc; thereafter, the disc cannot be packet-written any further. <b>Packet</b> <b>writing,</b> together with support from the operating system and a file system like UDF, can be used to mimic random write-access as in media like flash memory and magnetic disks.|$|E

40|$|Network {{switches}} and routers need to serve <b>packet</b> <b>writes</b> and reads at rates that challenge {{the most advanced}} memory technologies. As a result, scaling the switching rates is commonly done by parallelizing the packet I/Os using multiple memory units. For improved read rates, packets can be coded upon write, thus giving more flexibility at read time to achieve higher utilization of the memory units. This paper presents a detailed study of coded network switches, and in particular how to design them to maximize the throughput advantages over standard uncoded switches. Toward that objective the paper contributes a variety of algorithmic and analytical tools to improve and evaluate the throughput performance. The most interesting {{finding of this study}} is that the placement of packets in the switch memory is the key to both high performance and algorithmic efficiency. One particular placement policy we call "design placement" is shown to enjoy the best combination of throughput performance and implementation feasibility.

40|$|Network {{switches}} and routers need to serve <b>packet</b> <b>writes</b> and reads at rates that challenge {{the most advanced}} memory technologies. As a result, scaling the switching rates is commonly done by parallelizing the packet I/Os using multiple memory units. For improved read rates, packets can be coded with an [n,k] MDS code, thus giving more flexibility at read time to achieve higher utilization of the memory units. In the paper, we study the usage of [n,k] MDS codes in a switching environment. In particular, we study the algorithmic problem of maximizing the instantaneous read rate given a set of packet requests and the current layout of the coded packets in memory. The most interesting results from practical standpoint show how the complexity of reaching optimal read rate depends strongly on the writing policy of the coded packets.

50|$|Deleting {{files and}} {{directories}} of a CD-R using <b>packet</b> <b>writing</b> technology does not recover the space occupied by these objects but, rather, {{they are simply}} marked as being deleted (making them effectively hidden). Similarly, changes to files cause new instances to be created instead of replacing the original files. Because of this, the available space on a non-rewritable medium using <b>packet</b> <b>writing</b> technology will decrease every time its content is modified.|$|E
50|$|Without <b>packet</b> <b>writing,</b> {{optical media}} like the {{above-mentioned}} {{would have to}} be written on in one big block, like Disc At Once (DAO), Session At Once (SAO) and Track At Once (TAO), because these media types normally do not support sectors. After formatting with <b>packet</b> <b>writing</b> the medium is sectored in blocks that can be written to individually. The preferred file system is the Universal Disk Format (UDF) in versions from 1.50 onward, which is also used by DLA.|$|E

40|$|All routers contain buffers to hold packets {{during times}} of congestion. When {{designing}} a high-capacity router (or linecard) {{it is challenging to}} design buffers because of the buffer's speed and size, both of which grow linearly with line-rate, R. With today's DRAM technology, it is barely possible to design buffers for a 40 Gb/s linecard in which <b>packets</b> are <b>written</b> to (read from) memory at the rate at which they arrive (depart). Over time, the problem will get harder: Link rates will increase, line cards will connect to more lines, and buffers will get larger. Ideally, we would like a memory with the density of DRAM, and the speed of SRAM. And so some commercial routers sometimes use hybrid packet buffers built from a combination of small fast SRAM and large slow DRAM. The SRAM holds ("caches") the heads and tails of packet FIFOs, allowing arriving <b>packets</b> to be <b>written</b> quickly to the tail, and departing packets to be read quickly from the head. The large DRAMs are used for bulk storage, to hold the majority of packets in each FIFO that are neither at the head nor the tail. Because of the relatively long time to write to (or read from) the DRAMs, data is transferred between SRAM and DRAM in large fixedsize blocks, consisting of perhaps many packets at a time. A memory manager shuttles packets between the SRAM cache and the DRAM with two goals: (I) Arriving <b>packets</b> are <b>written</b> to DRAM before the SRAM overflows, and (2) Departing packets are guaranteed to be in the SRAM when it's their turn to leave. In this paper we find optimal memory managers that achieve both goals, while minimizing the size of the SRAM cache. When the delay through the buffer is minimized, the size of the SRAM cache is proportional to Q In Q, where Q is the number of FIFOs t [...] ...|$|R
