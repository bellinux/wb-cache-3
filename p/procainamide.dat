25|$|People with atrial {{fibrillation}} and rapid ventricular response are often treated with amiodarone or <b>procainamide</b> to stabilize their heart rate. <b>Procainamide</b> and cardioversion are now accepted treatments for conversion of tachycardia found with WPW. Amiodarone was previously {{thought to be}} safe in {{atrial fibrillation}} with WPW, but after several cases of ventricular fibrillation, {{it is no longer}} recommended in this clinical scenario.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{cardioversion}} {{is performed}} with drugs, such as amiodarone, dronedarone, <b>procainamide,</b> dofetilide, ibutilide, propafenone, or flecainide.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine {{inhibits}} the renal excretion of metformin and <b>procainamide,</b> {{resulting in}} increased circulating levels of these drugs.|$|E
25|$|Both propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene are potent {{blockers}} {{of cardiac}} membrane sodium channels {{and are more}} potent than lidocaine, quinidine, and <b>procainamide</b> in this respect. As a result, propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene appear to have {{the characteristics of a}} Vaughn-Williams Class Ic antiarrhythmic.|$|E
25|$|Drug-induced lupus {{erythematosus}} is a (generally) reversible condition that usually occurs in people {{being treated for}} a long-term illness. Drug-induced lupus mimics SLE. However, symptoms of drug-induced lupus generally disappear once the medication that triggered the episode is stopped. More than 38 medications can cause this condition, {{the most common of}} which are <b>procainamide,</b> isoniazid, hydralazine, quinidine, and phenytoin.|$|E
25|$|WPW {{syndrome}} is treated with either medications or radiofrequency catheter ablation. It affects between 0.1 and 0.3% in the population. The {{risk of death}} in those without symptoms is about 0.5% per year in children and 0.1% per year in adults. In those without symptoms ongoing observation may be reasonable. In those with WPW complicated by atrial fibrillation, cardioversion or the medication <b>procainamide</b> may be used. The condition is named after Louis Wolff, John Parkinson, and Paul Dudley White who described the ECG findings in 1930.|$|E
25|$|The {{first case}} report {{in which the}} {{shortening}} of the QT interval by primidone was documented, published in the July 1980 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine, involved three patients, a 31-year-old woman, her 15-year-old nephew, and his 16-year-old sister. The woman still had ventricular fibrillation, syncope, and seizures even after the removal of her left stellate ganglion and a thoracic chain dissection. The woman had previously been tried {{on a combination of}} phenobarbital and phenytoin when she was thought to have only seizures, followed by phenobarbital combined phenytoin and <b>procainamide.</b> The <b>procainamide</b> was replaced with propanolol, which in turn replaced the propanolol when the latter brought the tachycardia back almost instantaneously upon the first dose. The phenobarbital and phenytoin were then combined with atropine and acetyl strophanthidin. When this failed, the atropine and acetyl strophanthidin were replaced with lidocaine prior to the surgery. After the surgery, the QT-prolongation returned, so the phenytoin was doubled to 200mg four times daily. A month later, she was admitted to the hospital for phenytoin toxicity, where it was found that she had slow spike and abortive wave activity in her left temporal lobe. It was after this that primidone was substituted for phenytoin. The primidone suppressed the fibrillations and lengthened the QT interval for two years and eight months in the patient. Her 16-year-old niece was started on primidone after an unsuccessful trial of phenytoin. Following this, her 15-year-old nephew, the niece's brother, was started because of family history.|$|E
25|$|Anti-histone {{antibodies}} {{are found}} in the serum of up to 75â€“95% of people with drug induced lupus and 75% of idiopathic SLE. Unlike anti-dsDNA antibodies in SLE, these antibodies do not fix complement. Although they are most commonly found in drug induced lupus, they are also found in some cases of SLE, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis and undifferentiated connective tissue disease. Many drugs are known to cause drug induced lupus and they produce various antigenic targets within the nucleosome that are often cross reactive with several histone proteins and DNA. <b>Procainamide</b> causes a form of drug-induced lupus that produces antibodies to the histone H2A and H2B complex.|$|E

2500|$|Drug-induced lupus {{erythematosus}} (DIL or DILE) is an autoimmune disorder (similar to systemic {{lupus erythematosus}} [...] ) caused by chronic use of certain drugs. These drugs cause an autoimmune response (the body attacks its own cells) producing symptoms {{similar to those of}} SLE. There are 38 known medications to cause DIL but there are three that report the highest number of cases: [...] hydralazine, <b>procainamide,</b> and isoniazid. While the criteria for diagnosing DIL has not been thoroughly established, symptoms of DIL typically present as muscle pain and joint pain. Generally, the symptoms recede after discontinuing use of the drugs.|$|E
50|$|Acecainide is {{the major}} {{metabolite}} of the antiarrhythmic drug, <b>procainamide.</b> Measurements of <b>procainamide</b> in serum may not accurately reflect the drug's complete pharmacologic activity in the body. Monitoring acecainide levels along with the <b>procainamide</b> is recommended during <b>procainamide</b> therapy. Acecainide is considered comparable in activity to its parent compound; however, acecainide levels will vary widely. Serum levels of acecainide increase in patients on chronic <b>procainamide</b> therapy, particularly in those with renal impairment. The average serum concentration ratio of acecainide to <b>procainamide</b> is 0.8 to 1.2, depending on a genetically determined tendency to acetylate <b>procainamide</b> rapidly or slowly. Because the ratio varies from patient to patient, measuring serum acecainide and <b>procainamide</b> together helps to achieve an optimum anti-arrhythmic effect and {{reduce the risk of}} toxicity.|$|E
50|$|Research {{shows that}} {{accumulation}} of acecainide during <b>procainamide</b> therapy can alter both <b>procainamide</b> elimination {{as well as}} its electrophysiologic actions. A few healthy people demonstrated that concomitantly administered trimethoprim decreased the renal clearance of <b>procainamide</b> and formed NAPA, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of both drugs and increases in QTc after <b>procainamide.</b> Trimethoprim, <b>procainamide</b> and acecainide are all excreted by active tubular secretion. Also amiodarone, cimetidine and trimethoprim increase the NAPA serum level. Cimetidine an ranitidine possible increases plasma <b>procainamide</b> and NAPA concentrations and subsequent toxicity. Furthermore, alcohol enhances acetylation of <b>procainamide</b> to NAPA and alcohol consumption may reduce half-life. It also has been shown that coadministration of para-aminobenzoic acid decreases the biotransformation of <b>procainamide</b> to acecainide in a patient with rapid acetylation kinetics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Procainamide</b> is {{structurally}} {{similar to}} procaine, but {{in place of}} an ester group, <b>procainamide</b> contains an amide group. This substitution {{is the reason why}} <b>procainamide</b> exhibits a longer half-life time than procaine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Procainamide</b> is metabolized via {{different}} pathways. The {{most common}} {{one is the}} acetylation of <b>procainamide</b> to the less-toxic N-acetylprocainamide. The rate of acetylation is genetically determined. There are two phenotypes that result from the acetylation process, namely the slow and rapid acetylator. <b>Procainamide</b> can also be oxidized by the cytochrome P-450 to a reactive oxide metabolite. But it seems that acetylation of the nitrogen group of <b>procainamide</b> decrease {{the amount of the}} chemical that would be available for the oxidative route.Other metabolites of <b>procainamide</b> include desethyl-N-acetylprocainamide, desethylprocainamide, p-aminobenzoic acid, which are excreted via the urine. N-acetyl-4-aminobenzoic acid as well as N-acetyl-3-hydroxyprocainamide, N-acetylprocainamide-N-oxide and N-acetyl-4-aminohippuric acid are also metabolites of <b>procainamide.</b>|$|E
50|$|Steady-state <b>procainamide</b> and {{acecainide}} {{concentrations were}} used to compute <b>procainamide</b> clearance and acecainide/procainamide (NAPA/PA) concentration ratio. Using stepwise multiple linear regression age, creatinine clearance and congestive heart failure were found to influence <b>procainamide</b> clearance significantly (p less than 0.05). Age and creatinine clearance effected the NAPA/PA concentration ratio (p less than 0.05). Based on this data, age appears to have an independent effect on both <b>procainamide</b> clearance and the NAPA/PA ratio that is separate from the decline in renal function that occurs in elderly patients.|$|E
50|$|For {{those who}} are stable with a {{monomorphic}} waveform the medications <b>procainamide</b> or sotalol may be used and are better than lidocaine. Evidence does not show that amiodarone is better than <b>procainamide.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, the {{clearance}} of acecainide was reduced {{in a few}} patients with cardiomyopathyand and ventricular arrhythmias. Also is excretion of <b>procainamide</b> and NAPA is reduced in patients with CKD.A major reaction to <b>procainamide</b> and several other drugs is a syndrome that closely resembles lupus. A reactive metabolite, possibly nitrosoprocainamide is thought {{to play a role}} in the lupus reaction. Acecainide, unlike <b>procainamide,</b> appears not to form a reactive metabolite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Procainamide</b> is metabolized in {{the liver}} to {{acecainide}} by N-acetyltransferase, an enzyme that is genetically determined. N-Acetyltransferase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA to arylamines and aromatic amines such as <b>procainamide.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Procainamide</b> {{can be used}} {{to treat}} atrial {{fibrillation}} in the setting of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and to treat wide complex hemodynamically stable tachycardias. Oral <b>procainamide</b> is no longer being manufactured in the US, but intravenous formulations are still available.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} side effects {{following}} the induction of <b>procainamide.</b> These adverse effects are ventricular dysrhythmia, bradycardia, hypotension and shock. The adverse effects occur even more often if the daily doses are increased. <b>Procainamide</b> may {{also lead to}} drug fever and other allergic responses. There is also a chance that systemic lupus erythematosus occurs, which {{at the same time}} leads to polyarthralgia, myalgia and pleurisy. Most of these side effects may occur due to the acetylation of <b>procainamide.</b>|$|E
50|$|Acecainide is {{pharmacologically}} {{active as}} an antiarrhythmic agent. It has electrophysiological {{effects of a}} class III antiarrhytmic drug and it {{is used as a}} medicine to increase the Q - T interval of the PQRST heart rhythm in patients with cardiac arrhythmias. The equivalent drug <b>procainamide,</b> which is a class Ia antiarrhytmic drug, is also used in patients with cardiac arrhythmias. Nevertheless, NAPA does only affect the Q - T interval, while <b>procainamide</b> has also effect on the QRS-interval. Also the electrophysiologic properties of NAPA are a little bit different from those of <b>procainamide</b> and NAPA is not completely effective for suppressing ventricular dysrhythmias, but its antiarrhythmic mechanisms {{are similar to those of}} <b>procainamide.</b>|$|E
50|$|Class Ia agents include quinidine, <b>procainamide</b> and disopyramide.|$|E
50|$|Acecainide (N-acetylprocainamide, NAPA) is an {{antiarrhythmic}} drug. Chemically, {{it is the}} N-acetylated metabolite of <b>procainamide.</b> It is a Class III antiarrhythmic agent, whereas <b>procainamide</b> is a Class Ia antiarrhythmic drug. It is {{only partially}} as active as procainamide; when checking levels, both must {{be included in the}} final calculation.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is just a}} close {{line between}} the plasma {{concentrations}} of the therapeutic and toxic effect, therefore a high risk for toxicity. Many symptoms resemble systemic lupus erythematosus because <b>procainamide</b> reactivates hydroxylamine and nitroso metabolites, which bind to histone proteins and are toxic to lymphocytes. The hydroxylamine and nitroso metabolites are also toxic to bone marrow cells and can cause agranulocytosis. These metabolites are formed due to the activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These leukocytes release myeloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide, which oxidize the primary aromatic amine of <b>procainamide</b> to form <b>procainamide</b> hydroxylamine. The release of hydrogen peroxide is also called a respiratory burst, which occurs for <b>procainamide</b> in monocytes but not in lymphocytes. Furthermore, the metabolites can be formed by activated neutrophils. These metabolites could then bind to their cell membranes and cause a release of autoantibodies which would react with the neutrophils. <b>Procainamide</b> hydroxylamine has more cytotoxicity by hindering the response of lymphocytes to T-cell and B-cell mitogens. Hydroxylamine can also generate methemoglobin, a protein that could hinder further oxygen exchange.|$|E
50|$|In animals, {{acecainide}} has positive inotropic effects, {{but it also}} causes negative chronotropic and hypotensive activity. The cardiovascular pharmacodynamics of <b>procainamide</b> and NAPA {{have not}} been well identified in small rodents without the presence of anesthesia or restraint. Researchers {{are trying to make}} models of the effects of <b>procainamide</b> and acecainide in animals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Procainamide,</b> an amide, has {{a longer}} {{duration}} of action than Procaine, an ester, {{because of the}} isosteric replacement of the ester oxygen with a nitrogen atom. <b>Procainamide</b> is a classical bioisostere because the valence electron structure of a disubstituted oxygen atom {{is the same as}} a trisubstituted nitrogen atom, as Langmuir showed.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Claude Beck was {{undertaking}} pioneer cardiac {{surgery at the}} Lakeside Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. During and after his surgery he was facing problems with arrhythmias. These problems were investigated by Frederick R. Mautz. In these experiments he used drugs similar to cocaine, because these drugs were readily absorbed from mucous membranes and were also known to have some effect on the myocardium. Mautz tried procaine, but its action was short-lived owing to digestion by esterases. From procaine Mautz synthesized <b>procainamide,</b> {{which is not a}} substrate for esterases. <b>Procainamide</b> has the additional advantage of being active by mouth. <b>Procainamide</b> was approved by the US FDA on June 2, 1950 under the brand name Pronestyl. In 1951 Pronestyl was launched by Bristol-Myers Squibb, a pharmaceutical company in the US. Along with the discovery of <b>procainamide</b> came the discovery of its metabolite acecainide.|$|E

50|$|<b>Procainamide</b> {{works as}} an {{anti-arrhythmic}} agent and is used to treat cardiac arrhythmia. It induces rapid block of the batrachotoxin (BTX)-activated sodium channels of the heart muscle and acts as antagonist to long-gating closures. The block is voltage-dependent and can occur from both sides; either from the intracellular or the extracellular side. Blocking from the extracellular side is weaker than from the intracellular side because it occurs via the hydrophobic pathway. <b>Procainamide</b> is present in charged form and probably requires a direct hydrophobic access to the binding site for blocking of the channel. Furthermore, blocking of the channel shows a decreased voltage sensitivity, which may result {{from the loss of}} voltage dependence of the blocking rate. Due to its charged and hydrophilic form, <b>procainamide</b> has its effect from the internal side, where it causes blockage of voltage-dependent, open channels. With increasing concentration of <b>procainamide,</b> the frequency of long blockage becomes less without the duration of blockage being affected. The rate of fast blocking is determined by the membrane depolarization. Membrane depolarization leads to increased blocking and decreased unblocking of the channels. <b>Procainamide</b> slows the conduction velocity and increases the refractory period, such that the maximal rate of depolarization is reduced.|$|E
