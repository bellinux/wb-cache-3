40|$|PageRank is an {{algorithm}} used {{by several}} search engines to rank web documents {{according to their}} assumed relevance and popularity deduced from the Web’s link structure. PageRank determines a global ordering of candidate search results according to each page’s popularity {{as determined by the}} number and importance of pages linking to these results. Personalized and topic-sensitive PageRank are variants of the algorithm that return a local ranking based on each user’s preferences as biased by a set of pages they trust or topics they prefer. In this paper we compare personalized and topic-sensitive local PageRanks to the global PageRank showing experimentally how similar or dissimilar results of <b>personalization</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> to the original global rank results and to other personalizations. Our approach is to examine a snapshot of the Web and determine how advantageous <b>personalization</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> in the best and worst cases and how it performs at various values of the damping factor in the PageRank formula. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Personalization systems provide {{customized}} service {{based on}} user preferences. In ubiquitous computing environments, <b>personalization</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> achieved based on user preferences stored on mobile devices. This requires {{a mechanism for}} capturing user information and making it available to users. However, storing and exchanging potentially personal information raises user privacy concerns. Past solutions to privacy in ubiquitous computing have been ad-hoc, application specific or partially implemented. This work explores a general framework to providing privacy-aware personalization in ubiquitous computing environments. A prototype implementation of the framework has been developed and evaluated. This paper describes the approach used and its underlying concepts. 1...|$|R

40|$|Context personalization, the {{practice}} of matching features of an instructional component to a learner‟s interests and experiences, has been framed in the literature as {{a means by which}} to improve learning by enhancing motivation. However, a related perspective could consider personalization a form of instructional assistance, with the potential to support the learning of new concepts. In this paper, the assistance dilemma, known to be “a fundamental unsolved problem in cognitive science ” (Koedinger, Pavlik, McLaren, & Aleven, 2008, p. 2159), is investigated for context personalization.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the concept of {{personalized}} e-Learning for the computer science (or informatics) education. Several authors have stated that personalization, in educational context, allows executing more efficient and effective learning processes.

50|$|More recently, {{personalized}} marketing, {{also known}} as Individual marketing, has become practical for bricks and mortar retailers. The market size, {{an order of magnitude}} greater than that of the Internet, demanded a different technological approach now available and in use. Many retailers attract customers to the physical store by offering discounted items which are automatically selected to appeal to the individual recipient. The interactivity occurs through the offer redemptions recorded by the point of sale systems, which can then update each model of the individual shopper. <b>Personalization</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> more accurate when based solely upon individual purchasing records because of the simplified and repetitive nature of some bricks and mortar retail purchasing, for example grocery superstores.|$|R
