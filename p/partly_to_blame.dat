Specifically, the court concluded that attorneys are obligated to ensure all relevant documents are discovered, retained, and produced. Further, the court suggested that litigators must guarantee that relevant documents are preserved by instituting a litigation hold on key data, and safeguarding archival media.|$|R

25|$|Virginia Fortna of Columbia University, however, {{holds that}} {{peacekeeping}} interventions actually do substantively matter following {{the end of}} a civil war. She claims that selection bias, where opponents point only to failed peacekeeping interventions and do not compare these missions to those situations where interventions do not occur, is <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> for criticisms. Fortna says that peacekeeping missions rarely go into easily resolvable situations while they are sent into tougher, more risky post war situations where missions are more likely to fail, and peace agreements are unlikely to be committed to. When all factors of a certain peacekeeping case study are properly considered, Fortna shows that peacekeeping missions do in fact help increase the chances of sustained peace after a civil war.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the study of ancient diseases mentioned in the historical period of the Scriptures {{in the region of}} Syro-Palestine. The definition, history, methodology and etymology of the terms relating to biblical diseases are discussed. Leprosy, syphilis, plague and anaemia amongst other diseases leave skeletal signs and lesions. Paleopathologists may reveal these diseases by studying skeletal remains of the population of Syro-Palestine. Criticisms and recommendations are offered for the practical paleopathologist, anthropologist or archaeologist. More interest should be taken in the study of coprolite in every new discovery of human remains. The scarcity of skeletal remains in the region is well known.

40|$|In recent years, it {{has become}} {{increasingly}} fashionable to attribute a myriad 0 f our economic and social difficulties to excessive government regulation. If we are to believe the rhetoric, government regulation is <b>partly</b> or largely <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> for soaring inflation, lagging growth in GNP, declining productivity growth, the decline {{in the value of the}} dollar, and even general reductions in the animal spirits ot ~ entrepreneurs. While many of these claims may eventually be shown to have some validity, the evidence linking regulation to these various national economic maladies is presently very weak. The reaction against regulation which has developed in the past few years reflects the confluence of two different forces: (i) a growing concern that "economic " (rate-setting, entry-restricting) regulation overly restricts competition and protects regulated firms from new technologies and new competitors; and (ii) the view that newer ’°social " (health-safety-environmental) regulation directs too many resources to controlling various hazards, excessively reducing privately traded goods and services.

The {{extent that they}} actually managed to deliver the content warranted phenomenon worthy of exploration. To what extent do non- native speakers of English had meaningfully delivered the Mathematics and Science lesson contents to their students who were themselves were non-native speakers of English? The {{purposes of this study}} were to identify and document teacher practices in Content-Based Instruction (CBI) in secondary schools, and to ascertain teachers’ reasons for adopting their CBI practices within their classrooms. The participants were mathematics and science teachers who were purposely selected. Nevertheless, their selection was based on the recommendation made by the State Education Department. Video recordings of lessons (mathematics and science) and stimulated recall technique were used, whereby teachers watched their teaching videos / episodes and justified their action within the classrooms. The teachers actual words uttered while teaching were different from what they had actually intended to communicate during the classroom discourse. Teachers’ actual explanation was unclear due to wrong selection of precise words during the explanation in the classroom discourse. The teachers felt that their classroom discourse were not successful to evoke students, meaningful learning of the lesson content. Teachers usually need to think about the content in Malay {{and they need to be}} sufficiently quick to translate from Malay to English, hence possess skill in code-switching. The teachers realized that their “quality of communicating the lesson content is questionable”. They agreed that the teachers are <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> be <b>blamed</b> for how the students had interpreted our explanations...|$|R
25|$|While the team's recent struggles {{compared}} to Pittsburgh's other two teams can be <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> (since the Pirates last World Series championship in 1979, the Steelers {{have won the}} Super Bowl 3 times (XIV, XL, and XLIII) and the Penguins the Stanley Cup five times in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017, including both in 2009), distractions off the field have also caused the team's popularity to slip in the city. While the team was ranked first in Pittsburgh as recent as the late 1970s, the Pittsburgh drug trials in 1985 and two relocation threats since {{are believed to have}} also seen the team's popularity dipped. The team's standing among fans has, however, improved along with the team on the field and the opening of PNC Park in 2001.|$|E
25|$|When locals {{heard of}} the group's plans for {{starting}} a new society in the Americas, rumours were spread and criticism was lodged against Pantisocracy. This was compounded when Southey's aunt, with whom he was living, found out about both the idea and Southey's intention in marrying Edith Fricker, a person that his aunt felt was below his station. His aunt immediately stopped talking to him and kicked him out of her house. When Coleridge left for London, his thoughts about Pantisocracy began to change and he backed off {{his role in the}} matter. This was <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> for the intervention by Mary Evans and his brother George, and partly about Southey advocating for a master class and a servant class in their new society, all of which upset Coleridge. The idea did not completely collapse until Southey abandoned the plans in August 1795 in order to become a lawyer.|$|E

500|$|Elizabeth {{was happy}} to play the part, but it is {{possible}} that in the last decade of her life she began to believe her own performance. She became fond and indulgent of the charming but petulant young Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, who was Leicester's stepson and took liberties with her for which she forgave him. She repeatedly appointed him to military posts despite his growing record of irresponsibility. After Essex's desertion of his command in Ireland in 1599, Elizabeth had him placed under house arrest and the following year deprived him of his monopolies. In February 1601, the earl tried to raise a rebellion in London. He intended to seize the queen but few rallied to his support, and he was beheaded on 25 February. Elizabeth knew that her own misjudgements were <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> for this turn of events.

500|$|Adeline Hulot, on {{the other}} hand, is mercy personified. Like her cousin Bette, she comes from a peasant background, but has internalized the ideals of 19th-century womanhood, {{including}} devotion, grace, and deference. She reveals in the first scene that she has known for years about her husband's infidelities, but refuses to condemn him. Adeline's forgiving nature is often considered a significant character flaw. Some suggest that she is <b>partly</b> <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> for Hulot's wandering affection. C.A. Prendergast, for example, calls her forgiveness [...] "an inadequate and even positively disastrous response" [...] to her situation. He further suggests that Adeline, by choosing the role of quiet and dutiful wife, has excised from herself the erotic power to which the Baron is drawn. [...] "ne could {{at the very least}} offer the tentative speculation that Hulot's obsessional debauchery is in part the result of a certain poverty in Adeline, that the terrible logic of Hulot's excess is partially shaped by a crucial deficiency in his wife." [...] Others are less accusatory; Adeline's nearly infinite mercy, they say, is evidence of foolishness. Critic Herbert J. Hunt declares that she shows [...] "more imbecility than Christian patience", and David Bellos points out that, like her husband, she is driven by passion– albeit of a different kind: [...] "Adeline's desire (for good, for the family, for Hector, for God) is so radically different from the motivating desires of the other characters that she seems in their context to be without desire..." ...|$|E
