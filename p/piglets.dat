He often cut lumber from the forest to build his own furniture. At various times, he had rabbits, sheep, cows, calves, <b>piglets</b> and a fish pond of brown trout at his property. According to himself, he kept the livestock largely in protest against tax authorities, while also as a hobby.|$|E
5|$|Rotaviruses infect {{the young}} of {{many species of}} animals {{and they are a}} major cause of {{diarrhoea}} in wild and reared animals worldwide. As a pathogen of livestock, notably in young calves and <b>piglets,</b> rotaviruses cause economic loss to farmers because of costs of treatment associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. These rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human rotaviruses. There is evidence that animal rotaviruses can infect humans, either by direct transmission of the virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to reassortants with human strains.|$|E
50|$|Some hog-dog rodeos {{feature a}} <b>piglet</b> chase for kids. A muzzled feral <b>piglet</b> is {{released}} {{into an area}} filled with children who try to catch the <b>piglet.</b> The child who manages to catch the <b>piglet</b> wins a prize.|$|R
50|$|<b>Piglet</b> sees {{a shadowy}} monster called the Granosorus and is scared of it, but it disappears before his friends can see it. Even Christopher Robin {{does not believe}} him. Christopher tells <b>Piglet</b> to {{overcome}} his fears, but <b>Piglet</b> says that heroes {{are supposed to be}} big and brave, and since he is the opposite, he realizes that he will never be a hero. <b>Piglet</b> leaves the Hundred-Acre-Wood as his friends start to fall asleep doing what <b>Piglet</b> saw them doing. <b>Piglet</b> magically enters their dreams and begins to help them find their missing items. After helping them all, the Hundred Acre Wood get flooded and <b>Piglet</b> attempts to save his friends, who are trapped on islands with Heffalumps and Woozles. Once <b>Piglet</b> rescues everyone the Granosorus appears, but <b>Piglet</b> was able to scare it off. Christopher Robin comes and after learning about their adventures he gives everyone a picnic to celebrate <b>Piglet's</b> bravery.|$|R
5000|$|Sympathetic to <b>Piglet's</b> fear, Pooh, Eeyore and Tigger {{decide to}} avoid the {{frightening}} aspects of Halloween and throw <b>Piglet</b> a less frightening [...] "Hallo-wasn't" [...] party instead. When the three costumed friends show up at <b>Piglet's</b> house, he mistakes them for a monster and flees. The trio of friends discover <b>Piglet</b> is missing, and go to search {{for him in the}} night. Simultaneously, <b>Piglet</b> goes looking for Pooh and the others, but when he can't find any of his friends, <b>Piglet</b> believes they've all been taken by [...] "Spookables".|$|R
5|$|<b>Piglets</b> {{that were}} fed with a formula {{containing}} milk phospholipids and gangliosides to mimic levels in human milk made choices more rapidly and with fewer errors in a spatial T-maze cognitive test compared to controls, implying improved spatial learning. Similarly, Vickers et al. (2009) demonstrated that administration of complex milk lipids to rats from postnatal day 10 through adulthood (day 80) led to {{significant improvements in}} learning and memory tasks compared to control animals. Conversely, a study of complex milk lipid supplementation to pregnant mice {{did not have an}} effect on cognitive tasks in their offspring.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006, Mills and McCartney {{travelled}} to Canada {{to bring}} attention to the country's annual seal hunt. Sponsored by the Humane Society of the United States, they complained that the hunt was inhumane, and called on the Canadian government {{to put an end}} to it. Their arrival on the floes sparked much attention in Newfoundland and Labrador, where 90 per cent of the sealers live. Mills and McCartney protested against seals being clubbed to death, pierced with boat hooks and sometimes skinned alive. Newfoundland and Labrador's Premier, Danny Williams, debated the issue with them on Larry King Live, the issue being that seals are no longer hunted that way, and have not been for a while. Mills joined a Viva! film team at a pig farm in Somerset, in February 2007, to publicise the use of restrictive farrowing crates, which are used for sows who are suckling <b>piglets.</b> A video of the investigation was made available on the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Meat, {{mainly from}} farmed animals, {{is a major}} source of dietary protein around the world, {{averaging}} about 8% of man's energy intake. The actual types eaten depend on local preferences, availability, cost and other factors, with cattle, sheep, pigs and goats being the main species involved. Cattle generally produce a single offspring annually which takes more than a year to mature; sheep and goats often have twins and these are ready for slaughter in less than a year; pigs are more prolific, producing more than one litter of up to about 11 <b>piglets</b> each year. Horses, donkeys, deer, buffalo, llamas, alpacas, guanacos and vicunas are farmed for meat in various regions. Some desirable traits of animals raised for meat include fecundity, hardiness, fast growth rate, ease of management and high food conversion efficiency. About half of the world's meat is produced from animals grazing on open ranges or on enclosed pastures, the other half being produced intensively in various factory-farming systems; these are mostly cows, pigs or poultry, and often reared indoors, typically at high densities.|$|E

5|$|The {{guinea pig}} {{is able to}} breed year-round, with birth peaks usually coming in the spring; {{as many as five}} litters can be {{produced}} per year. The gestation period lasts from 59–72 days, with an average of 63–68 days. Because of the long gestation period and the large size of the pups, pregnant females may become large and eggplant-shaped, although the change in size and shape varies. Unlike the offspring of most other rodents, which are altricial at birth, newborn pups are well-developed with hair, teeth, claws, and partial eyesight; they are immediately mobile, and begin eating solid food immediately, though they continue to suckle. Litters yield one to six pups, with an average of three; the largest recorded litter size is 17. The guinea pig mother only has two nipples, but she can readily raise the more average-sized litters of 2 to 4 <b>piglets.</b>|$|E
25|$|Newborn <b>piglets</b> weigh around 600–1,000 grams, lacking underfur {{and bearing}} a single milk incisor and canine on each {{half of the}} jaw. There is intense {{competition}} between the <b>piglets</b> over the most milk-rich nipples, as the best fed young grow faster and have stronger constitutions. The <b>piglets</b> do not leave the lair for their first week of life. Should the mother be absent, the <b>piglets</b> lie closely pressed to each other. By two weeks of age, the <b>piglets</b> begin accompanying their mother on her journeys. Should danger be detected, the <b>piglets</b> take cover or stand immobile, relying on their camouflage to keep them hidden. The neonatal coat fades after three months, with adult colouration being attained at eight months. Although the lactation period lasts 2.5–3.5 months, the <b>piglets</b> begin displaying adult feeding behaviours {{at the age of}} 2–3 weeks. The permanent dentition is fully formed by 1–2 years. With the exception of the canines in males, the teeth stop growing {{during the middle of the}} fourth year. The canines in old males continue to grow throughout their lives, curving strongly as they age. Sows attain sexual maturity at the age of one year, with males attaining it a year later. However, estrus usually first occurs after two years in sows, while males begin participating in the rut after 4–5 years, as they are not permitted to mate by the older males. The maximum lifespan in the wild is 10–14 years, though few specimens survive past 4–5 years. Boars in captivity have lived for 20 years.|$|E
25|$|Contact calls: Grunting noises which {{differ in}} {{intensity}} {{according to the}} situation. Adult males are usually silent, while females frequently grunt and <b>piglets</b> whine. When feeding, boars express their contentment through purring. Studies have shown that <b>piglets</b> imitate the sounds of their mother, thus different litters may have unique vocalisations.|$|E
5000|$|Pooh's friends form {{themselves}} into a rescue rope, {{but it is not}} quite long enough and Pooh is stuck hanging precariously over the waterfall. <b>Piglet</b> appears and pulls Pooh to safety, but the log begins to break, which knocks <b>Piglet's</b> scrapbook into the river below. Rabbit, Eeyore, Tigger, and Roo all make it to solid ground, {{just in time to see}} half of the log plummet to the water below. Tigger, Rabbit, Roo and Eeyore begin to cry and almost fail to notice Pooh and <b>Piglet</b> emerging from inside of the other half of the log. <b>Piglet's</b> friends take him home and show him the drawings they have made of him, demonstrating their appreciation for everything <b>Piglet</b> has done. They have a party and Pooh shows <b>Piglet</b> the new sign for the renamed [...] "Pooh and <b>Piglet</b> Corner." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{breeding}} {{period in}} most areas lasts from November to January, though most mating only lasts {{a month and a}} half. Prior to mating, the males develop their subcutaneous armour, in preparation for confronting rivals. The testicles double in size and the glands secrete a foamy yellowish liquid. Once ready to reproduce, males travel long distances in search of a sounder of sows, eating little on the way. Once a sounder has been located, the male drives off all young animals and persistently chases the sows. At this point, the male fiercely fights potential rivals, A single male can mate with 5–10 sows. By the end of the rut, males are often badly mauled and have lost 20% of their body weight, with bite-induced injuries to the penis being common. The gestation period varies according to the age of the expecting mother. For first time breeders, it lasts 114–130 days, while it lasts 133–140 days in older sows. Farrowing occurs between March and May, with litter sizes depending on the age and nutrition of the mother. The average litter consists of 4–6 <b>piglets,</b> with the maximum being 10–12. The <b>piglets</b> are whelped in a nest constructed from twigs, grasses and leaves. Should the mother die prematurely, the <b>piglets</b> are adopted by the other sows in the sounder.|$|E
40|$|One day, when Christopher Robin and Winnie-the-Pooh and <b>Piglet</b> {{were all}} talking together, Christopher Robin {{finished}} the mouthful {{he was eating}} and said carelessly: “I saw a Heffalump to-day, <b>Piglet.</b> ” “What was it doing? ” asked <b>Piglet.</b> “Just lumping along, ” said Christopher Robin. “ I don’t think it saw me. ” “I saw one once, ” said <b>Piglet,</b> “At least, I think I did, ” he said. “Only perhaps it wasn’t. ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Piglet</b> was {{originally}} omitted by Disney {{in the first}} Pooh film, Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree (1966). According to the film's director, Wolfgang Reitherman, <b>Piglet</b> was replaced by Gopher, which was thought {{to have a more}} [...] "folksy, all-American, grass-roots image". Many familiar with the classic Milne books protested Disney's decision to exclude <b>Piglet,</b> and Disney relented. <b>Piglet</b> appeared in the next Pooh film, Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968).|$|R

25|$|To reduce {{aggression}} in overcrowded conditions, shortly after birth <b>piglets</b> are castrated, their tails are amputated, and their teeth clipped. Calves are sometimes raised in veal crates, which are small stalls that essentially immobilize calves during their growth, reducing costs and preventing muscle development, making the resulting meat a pale color, preferred by consumers.|$|E
25|$|On 19/29NovemberO.S./N.S. the Commission's subdelegates, Jacob Brummer and Wilhelm Schröder, {{arrived at}} Himmelpforten Convent {{in order to}} sight the {{situation}} there. Much of the chattels had been plundered by the Leaguists since their invasion. The lifestock then counted four horses, two cows and one calf, 15 fattening pigs, 25 breeding pigs, five <b>piglets</b> and uncounted geese, ducks and chickens.|$|E
25|$|Sow stalls {{contain no}} bedding {{material}} and are instead floored with slatted plastic or metal to allow waste to be efficiently collected below.

5000|$|Back in the present, <b>Piglet's</b> friends {{express their}} regrets for not celebrating <b>Piglet's</b> heroism. They become {{increasingly}} worried as a storm rolls in; to reassure Roo, Eeyore and Pooh {{tell him about}} the time <b>Piglet</b> built a house for Eeyore. <b>Piglet</b> has pointed out to Pooh that Eeyore did not have a house to keep him warm. Pooh decides that they should build Eeyore a house on that very spot, which he names [...] "Pooh Corner." [...] Pooh briefly considers calling it [...] "Pooh and <b>Piglet</b> Corner" [...] before deciding that [...] "Pooh Corner" [...] sounds nicer. Tigger joins Pooh in trying to build the house while <b>Piglet</b> struggles to keep up; eventually, Pooh and Tigger give up. Then they learn that Eeyore has already built himself a house out of sticks, though it has gone missing. Pooh and Tigger realize that they are using Eeyore's old house to build Eeyore's new house. As they struggle to explain, <b>Piglet</b> arrives and leads them back to Eeyore's newly completed house. Once again, <b>Piglet's</b> contributions are overlooked as the wind gets the credit for moving Eeyore's house.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Piglet's</b> {{favorite}} food is acorns (or {{as the book}} often spells it, [...] "haycorns"). At one point he plants one just outside his house, in hopes of someday having a handy supply.

[...] According to <b>Piglet,</b> that is [...] "short for Trespassers Will, which is short for Trespassers William," [...] which was the name of his grandfather. Later in The House at Pooh Corner, Eeyore mistakenly offers <b>Piglet's</b> house as a new home for Owl, after Owl's house had blown down. <b>Piglet</b> nobly agrees to let Owl have the house, at which point Pooh asks <b>Piglet</b> to live with him and <b>Piglet</b> accepts.|$|R
25|$|A pig is any of {{the animals}} in the genus Sus, within the even-toed {{ungulate}} family Suidae. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as <b>piglets.</b> Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.|$|E
25|$|S.dysgalactiae {{has been}} {{isolated}} from infectious polyarthritis in several animal species, including <b>piglets,</b> lambs, calves and goats. Furthermore, {{it has been}} implicated in neonatal mortality among puppies. Recently, SDSD {{has been described as}} an emerging pathogen in fish, causing fulminant necrotic ulcers of the caudal peduncle, with ensuing high mortality rates. The clinical presentation is dominated by severe sepsis and the formation of microabscesses, and a relationship between disease severity and the expression of the virulence factors Streptolysin S and SPEGdys has been inferred.|$|E
25|$|Domesticated pigs, called swine, {{are raised}} commercially for meat (generally called pork, hams, gammon or bacon), {{as well as}} for leather. Their bristly hairs are also used for brushes. Due to their common use as livestock, adult swine have gender {{specific}} names: the males are boars and the females are sows. In Britain, the word hog can refer to a castrated adult male pig. Young swine are called <b>piglets</b> or pigs. Pork {{is one of the most}} popular forms of meat for human consumption, accounting for 38% of worldwide meat production.|$|E
