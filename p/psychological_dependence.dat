5|$|The benzodiazepines {{diazepam}} (Valium) and oxazepam (Serepax) {{have been}} found to produce fewer withdrawal reactions than alprazolam (Xanax), temazepam (Restoril/Normison), or lorazepam (Temesta/Ativan). Factors that determine the risk of <b>psychological</b> <b>dependence</b> or physical dependence and the severity of the benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during dose reduction of alprazolam include: dosage used, length of use, frequency of dosing, personality characteristics of the individual, previous use of cross-dependent/cross-tolerant drugs (alcohol or other sedative-hypnotic drugs), current use of cross-dependent/-tolerant drugs, use of other short-acting, high-potency benzodiazepines, and method of discontinuation.|$|E
5|$|After four largely injury-free seasons, {{the muscular}} {{injuries}} {{that had previously}} plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench {{in the second half}} and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7–0 on aggregate by the eventual champions. These matches gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's perceived tactical and <b>psychological</b> <b>dependence</b> on their star player.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are used}} recreationally and by {{problematic}} drug misusers. Mortality is higher among poly-drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly-drug users. Dependence and tolerance, often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; withdrawal syndrome may appear after {{as little as}} three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use {{has the potential to}} cause both physical and <b>psychological</b> <b>dependence</b> and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of panic attacks), and agoraphobia. Benzodiazepines and, in particular, temazepam are sometimes used intravenously, which, if done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including abscesses, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, arterial puncture, deep vein thrombosis, and gangrene. Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. Benzodiazepines are also misused intranasally, which may have additional health consequences. Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established, a clinician usually converts the patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam before beginning a gradual reduction program.|$|E

40|$|Addictive {{drugs have}} been shown to {{severely}} influence many neuronal functions, which are considered as the underlying mechanisms for physiological and <b>psychological</b> <b>dependences.</b> We previously showed that in vivo LTP in rat hippocampal CA 1 region is significantly reduced during withdrawal following chronic opiates treatment, and the reduced LTP can be restored by re-exposure of animals to corresponding drugs. Here, we further demonstrated that during opiates withdrawal, the re-exposure of morphine either systemically (subcutaneously) or locally (intracerebroventricularly) could restore the reduced LTP in heroin-dependent rats, but heroin could not restore the reduced LTP, in morphine-dependent rats, indicating differential modulations of hippocampal functions by those two opiates. In contrast, DAMGO, a mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, could restore the reduced LTP, and CTOP, a MOR antagonist, could block the restoration in rats dependent on both opiates, showing that MOR is functional under such conditions. However, the upregulation of hippocampal PKA activity during morphine withdrawal could be suppressed by re-exposure of morphine but not that of heroin, suggesting a likely underlying mechanism of the differential modulation of LTP by two opiates. Taken together, our study clearly demonstrates that chronic abuse of opiates inevitably leads to severe alteration of hippocampal LTP, and reveals the interesting differences between morphine and heroin in their effects on the differential modulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity.

25|$|Benzodiazepines are {{regarded}} as a highly addictive drug class.

25|$|Because of its {{sedative}} properties, diphenhydramine {{is widely}} used in nonprescription sleep aids for insomnia.

25|$|Proposed Type 1 Alcoholism is {{clinically}} {{characterized by}} a late onset (after the age of 25) of alcohol-related problems (usually after {{an extended period of}} drinking that is socially encouraged), strong <b>psychological</b> <b>dependence</b> (loss of control) with guilt and fear about alcohol dependence, and rare occurrence of fighting and arrests after drinking. Psychologically, it is proposed to be characterized by high reward-dependence (in both males and females).|$|E
25|$|The <b>psychological</b> <b>dependence</b> {{associated}} with morphine addiction {{is complex and}} protracted. Long after the physical need for morphine has passed, the addict will usually continue to think {{and talk about the}} use of morphine (or other drugs) and feel strange or overwhelmed coping with daily activities without being under the influence of morphine. Psychological withdrawal from morphine is usually a very long and painful process. Addicts often suffer severe depression, anxiety, insomnia, mood swings, amnesia (forgetfulness), low self-esteem, confusion, paranoia, and other psychological disorders. Without intervention, the syndrome will run its course, and most of the overt physical symptoms will disappear within 7 to 10 days including <b>psychological</b> <b>dependence.</b> A high probability of relapse exists after morphine withdrawal when neither the physical environment nor the behavioral motivators that contributed to the abuse have been altered. Testimony to morphine's addictive and reinforcing nature is its relapse rate. Abusers of morphine (and heroin) have one of the highest relapse rates among all drug users, ranging up to 98% in the estimation of some medical experts.|$|E

50|$|Several {{commonly}} used opioid drugs including etorphine and buprenorphine {{have been demonstrated}} to bind to nociceptin receptors, but this binding is relatively insignificant compared to their activity at other opioid receptors in the acute setting (however the non-analgesic NOPr antagonist SB-612,111 was demonstrated to potentiate the therapeutic benefits of morphine). Chronic administration of nociceptin receptor agonists results in an attentuation of the analgesic and anti-allodynic effects of opiates; this mechanism inhibits the action of endogenous opioids as well, resulting {{in an increase in}} pain severity, depression, and both physical and <b>psychological</b> opiate <b>dependence</b> following chronic NOPr agonist administration. Administration of the NOPr antagonist SB-612,111 has been shown to inhibit this process. More recently a range of selective ligands for NOP have been developed, which show little or no affinity to other opioid receptors and so allow NOP-mediated responses to be studied in isolation.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} an {{examination}} {{of the ways in which}} Englishness was associated with horror long before the success of Hammer, the British studio that in the late 1950 s and 1960 s became synonymous with a particularly English version of Gothic cinema. During the 1930 s and 1940 s, many key horror stars were English or signified Englishness; and the article explores the ways in which this was due to a preoccupation with themes of <b>psychological</b> dominance and <b>dependence</b> during the period. In other words, the threat of <b>psychological</b> dominance and <b>dependence</b> that preoccupied horror films meant that the horror villain was often associated with the spectre of old-world despotism in relation to which the United States defined itself as a rejection. Furthermore, these psychological themes also demonstrate that, during this period, the horror film either included, or was intimately related to, the gangster film and spy thriller so that most horror stars played a range of horror villains, gangsters and spies. However, rather than focusing of figures such as Boris Karloff, Colin Clive, Lionel Atwill or George Zucco (the British actors most commonly associated with the horror film during this period), the article will concentrate on a series of actors closely associated with horror in the period, but who are not necessarily remembered in this way today—Claude Rains, Charles Laughton, Basil Rathbone and Vincent Price—stars who demonstrate the ways in which psychological themes not only connected the horror villain, gangster and spy but were also related to the spectre of old-world despotism...|$|R

50|$|Benzodiazepines {{are most}} often {{prescribed}} to patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Research suggests that these drugs give some relief, {{at least in the}} short term. However, they carry some risks, mainly impairment of both cognitive and motor functioning, and <b>psychological</b> and physical <b>dependence</b> that makes it difficult for patients to stop taking them. It has been noted that people taking benzodiazepines are not as alert on their job or at school. Additionally, these drugs may impair driving and they are often associated with falls in the elderly, resulting in hip fractures. These shortcomings make the use of benzodiazepines optimal only for short-term relief of anxiety. CBT and medication are of comparable efficacy in the short-term but CBT has advantages over medication in the longer term.|$|R

40|$|Benzodiazepines are {{potentially}} addictive drugs: <b>psychological</b> and physical <b>dependence</b> can develop {{within a few}} weeks or years of regular or repeated use. The socioeconomic costs of the present high level of long-term benzodiazepine use are considerable.

However, many physicians continue to prescribe benzodiazepines and patients wishing to withdraw receive little advice or support. Particular care should be taken in prescribing benzodiazepines for vulnerable patients such as elderly persons, pregnant women, children, alcohol- or drug-dependent patients and patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders.

25|$|In many {{documented}} cases, dextromethorphan {{has produced}} <b>psychological</b> <b>dependence</b> {{in people who}} used it recreationally. However, it does not produce physical addiction, according to the WHO Committee on Drug Dependence. It is considered less addictive than the other common weak opiate cough suppressant, codeine. Since dextromethorphan also acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) users describe that regular recreational use {{over a longer period}} of time can cause withdrawal symptoms that are similar to those of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome.

25|$|Psychoactive {{drugs are}} often {{associated}} with addiction or drug dependence.

Drugs that are both rewarding and reinforcing are addictive; these properties of a drug are mediated through activation of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, particularly the nucleus accumbens. Not all addictive drugs are associated with physical dependence, e.g., amphetamine, and not all drugs that produce physical dependence are addictive drugs, e.g., caffeine.|$|E
25|$|Bromazepam (marketed under several brand names, {{including}} Lectopam, Lexotan, Lexilium, Lexaurin, Brazepam, Rekotnil, Bromaze, Somalium and Lexotanil) is a benzodiazepine derivative drug, {{patented by}} Roche in 1963 and developed clinically in the 1970s. It is mainly an anti-anxiety agent with similar side effects to diazepam (Valium). In {{addition to being}} used to treat anxiety or panic states, bromazepam {{may be used as}} a premedicant prior to minor surgery. Bromazepam typically comes in doses of 3mg and 6mg tablets. Bromazepam is contraindicated and should be used with caution in women who are pregnant, the elderly, patients with a history of alcohol or other substance abuse disorders and children. Prolonged use of bromazepam causes tolerance and may lead to both physical and <b>psychological</b> <b>dependence</b> on the drug, and as a result, it is a medication which is controlled by international law.|$|E
