5|$|In the United Kingdom, the uptake of DAB has {{increased}} since {{the launch of}} the BBC national DAB ensemble in 1995. Lower prices, new radio stations and marketing have increased the uptake of DAB radio in the UK. Digital radios were first sold as car radios in 1997, priced around £800, with hi-fi tuners costing up to £2,000 being released two years later. In 2001, Digital One invested in Frontier Silicon to produce a new processing chip which would allow cheaper <b>portable</b> <b>radios</b> to be produced. Roberts Radio, Goodmans and in 2002, Pure Digital's award winning Evoke series of radios broke the £100 price barrier, and DAB take up {{has increased}} since.|$|E
25|$|The {{transistor}} radio {{first appeared}} {{on the market in}} 1954. In particular, it made <b>portable</b> <b>radios</b> even more transportable. All sets quicklly became smaller, cheaper and more convenient. The aim of radio manufacturers became a radio in every room, in the car, and in the pocket.|$|E

50|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, {{microwave}} radio relay systems are being used increasingly in <b>portable</b> <b>radio</b> applications. The technology is particularly suited to this application because of lower operating costs, a more efficient infrastructure, and provision of direct hardware access to the <b>portable</b> <b>radio</b> operator.|$|R

25|$|Piezoelectric {{speakers}} {{are frequently}} used as beepers in watches and other electronic devices, and are sometimes used as tweeters in less-expensive speaker systems, such as computer speakers and <b>portable</b> <b>radios.</b> Piezoelectric speakers have several advantages over conventional loudspeakers: they {{are resistant to}} overloads that would normally destroy most high frequency drivers, {{and they can be}} used without a crossover due to their electrical properties. There are also disadvantages: some amplifiers can oscillate when driving capacitive loads like most piezoelectrics, which results in distortion or damage to the amplifier. Additionally, their frequency response, in most cases, is inferior to that of other technologies. This is why they are generally used in single frequency (beeper) or non-critical applications.|$|E
25|$|During the Redskins' {{game on the}} {{afternoon}} of December 7, 1941, against the Philadelphia Eagles, an announcement was made over Griffith Stadium's public-address system commanding all of the American generals and admirals there to report to their duty stations. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was not explicitly announced over the P.A. system; with no small, <b>portable</b> <b>radios</b> available in the 1940s, that left thousands of other spectators to be among the last Americans to learn of the Japanese attack. The Redskins won that game, their last game of the 1941 season, 20-14. They finished the season with a record of six wins and five losses, in third place in the NFL Eastern Division. Although the Redskins enjoyed only one winning record at home (4–2 in 1956) during their final 13 seasons at Griffith, they still finished with an 81-58-6 overall record at the stadium over 24 seasons.|$|E
25|$|Two {{weeks after}} the 2005 London bombings, a new {{directive}} stated that New York City would institute a citywide transit Auxiliary program {{with the intent of}} reducing crime and fighting terrorism in the city's transit system. Transit Auxiliary officers work out of Transit Bureau precincts known as Districts and carry Transit <b>portable</b> <b>radios.</b> Unlike a precinct, the transit districts cover miles of underground subway. Transit Auxiliary Police officers go through additional training by the Transit Bureau Vandals Squad as well as the Counter-Terrorism Division to build vandalism and terrorism awareness within the Transit System. Transit Auxiliary officers are paired with either a regular police officer or Auxiliary police officer. Transit Auxiliary Police periodically perform inspections of the subway station(s) and platforms which they are assigned to, taking note of any suspicious occurrences, and set up a fixed post at the subway turnstiles, token booths, mezzanines, or platforms. Transit Auxiliary officers also conduct subway train inspections as well as train runs to/from stations that which assignment is given. Due to the common medical emergency calls in Transit, if medically qualified, Transit Auxiliary Police officers can respond to medical emergencies if they are near to the transit location. The main function of the NYPD Transit Auxiliary Police, like the NYPD Transit Police, is to primarily remain within the subway system.|$|E

Three different voltages were generally required, using three different batteries {{designated as the}} A, B, and C battery.

Tube heaters were designed for single, double or triple-cell lead-acid batteries, giving nominal heater voltages of 2 V, 4 V or 6 V. In <b>portable</b> <b>radios,</b> dry batteries were sometimes used with 1.5 or 1 V heaters. Reducing filament consumption improved {{the life span of}} batteries.
