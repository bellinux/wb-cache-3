It is shown that a <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> equal to the foreign export subsidy is required to neutralize the impact of foreign export subsidies on the profits of domestic firms. The domestic country has an incentive to impose a <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> on foreign final goods even though foreign governments only subsidize exports of intermediate goods. In addition, foreign exporting firms may benefit from a <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> more than a foreign export subsidy.

40|$|Markets {{have long}} been used as {{benchmarks}} for economic value in various areas of law. However, a crucial question has received less than adequate attention: what type of market {{should be used in}} the market benchmark? More specifically, given all the imperfections one typically finds in day-to-day markets, how perfect does a market have to be in order to qualify as a benchmark for economic value? This Article discusses this question using <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> law as a case study. <b>Countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> law allows the United States to impose <b>countervailing</b> <b>duties</b> on imported merchandise to offset subsidies conferred by foreign governments upon such merchandise. In identifying and measuring subsidies, <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> law utilizes a market benchmark, i. e., whether the government action under investigation is on terms more favorable than those available in the market. After tracing the evolution of the market benchmark analysis in <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> law, I demonstrate that the market benchmark analysis, as currently formulated in <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> law, envisions a perfect or near-perfect market, i. e., a market that is undistorted by the government action under investigation. I further demonstrate the pitfalls of this perfect-market approach by critiquing the basis on which a market is rejected as distorted, the manner in which alternative benchmarks are selected, and the fundamental disconnect between the perfect-market approach and the purpose of <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> law...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a multidisciplinary {{analysis of the}} circumstances which surrounded the successful imposition of a <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> on whole Canadian groundfish, and indicates what implications this action may have for the future. First, it will situate the <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> investigation {{in terms of its}} relationship with U. S. statutes, and also with the Nation 2 ̆ 7 s international obligations. Then, the impact of the duty is examined to see how it might affect a potential free trade agreement with Canada. Similarly, the thesis projects what effect the duty will have in establishing a precedent, and assesses the likelihood of imposing similar duties on other imported seafood products. Finally, the actual case is presented in detail, so as to reveal what constituted an illegal 2 ̆ 2 subsidy, 2 ̆ 2 and to explain what 2 ̆ 2 material injury 2 ̆ 2 meant in this instance. Upon conclusion, it will become evident that fundamental inadequacies currently exist in both the U. S. <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> statutes and the international agreements from which the U. S. statutes are derived. Furthermore, significant discrepancies exist between these two interrelated bodies of law. Therefore, {{it is likely that the}} current <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> legislation will need to be amended. The investigation will probably not provide a great deal of assistance in analyzing the possibility of imposing <b>countervailing</b> <b>duties</b> on other fish products. While it further clarified the meaning of an illegal 2 ̆ 2 subsidy, 2 ̆ 2 and illustrated one instance where 2 ̆ 2 material injury 2 ̆ 2 was present, other questions remained unanswered. Inevitably, each case will possess its own nuances. Because of the complexity and flexibility of the legislation, predicting the outcome of a case will remain subject to uncertainty. Uncertainty will also surround the free trade negotiations between Canada and the United States. Because New England fishermen stand to 2 ̆ 2 lose out 2 ̆ 2 in such an arrangement, the <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> will probably be employed as a 2 ̆ 2 bargaining chip 2 ̆ 2 in the negotiations. In actuality, the imposition of a duty on Canadian groundfish resulted in very few positive implications. Rather, it served to illustrate that the competitive position of the U. S. fishing industry is eroding. Unless changes are instituted by both the U.

Although the WTO panel rejected China's claim of WTO-inconsistency regarding the current US practices, the US Court of International Trade firmly ruled that the Department of Commerce's double counting of AD and CVD against China violates domestic regulation. Finally, the WTO Appellate Body ruled that this 'double remedy' violates the rule to levy CVDs 'in the appropriate amounts' under Article 19. 3 of the SCM Agreement. We will argue that, although the Appellate Body's ruling is praiseworthy in preventing an illogical practice, its legal reasoning may give rise to some doubts and controversy when the negotiating history of Article 19 is examined.

Chapter 19 of the CFTA provides for binational dispute settlement in antidumping and <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> cases.

40|$|The {{interests}} of Canadian softwood lumber exporters were best served when Commerce found no subsidies {{in the first}} <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> case (CVD 1). This is the case, given that Canadian softwood producers were not subject to any restrictions, taxes or <b>duties.</b> With <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> 2 (CVD 2), Canada and the U. S. negotiated a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) {{which resulted in a}} 15 % export tax on Canadian softwood lumber exports. Certainly, this was less advantageous to Canadian softwood producers than the outcome of CVD 1. In theory, the relative ad/disadvantageousness of <b>countervailing</b> <b>duty</b> 3 (CVD 3) was on par with that of CVD 2. That is, Canadian lumber was subject to conditional access to the U.

This analysis discerns how the conditions at the launch of CVD 1 differed from those when each of the other disputes was launched.
