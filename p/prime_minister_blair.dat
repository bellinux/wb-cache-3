500|$|British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Britain stood [...] "shoulder to shoulder" [...] {{with the}} United States. A few days later, Blair flew to Washington to affirm British {{solidarity}} with the United States. In a speech to Congress, nine days after the attacks, which Blair attended as a guest, President Bush declared [...] "America has no truer friend than Great Britain." [...] Subsequently, <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Blair</b> embarked on two months of diplomacy to rally international support for military action; he held 54 meetings with world leaders and travelled more than 40,000 miles (60,000km).|$|E
500|$|Having {{been elected}} as leader Blair moves the Labour Party to the {{political}} centre ground, repackaging it as [...] "New Labour", {{and goes on to}} win the 1997 general election. At his first meeting with Elizabeth II following his election as <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Blair</b> recalls the Queen telling him, [...] "You are my tenth prime minister. The first was Winston. That was before you were born."

[...] Sandy Berger, Clinton’s National Security Advisor, explaining the decision in his Press Briefing on 7 December 2000, said that: [...] "Warwick is one of Britain's newest and finest research universities, singled out by <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Blair</b> as a model both of academic excellence and independence from the government." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{top secret}} memo leaked by a British civil servant and a {{parliamentary}} researcher detailed a lengthy conversation on April 16, 2004 between <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Blair</b> and President Bush, in which Bush according to British media allegedly proposed bombing the Qatar central office of Al Jazeera. House press secretary, Scott McClellan, describing it as [...] "outlandish" [...] said, [...] "Any such {{notion that we}} would engage {{in that kind of}} activity is just absurd." [...] A UK government official suggested that the Bush threat had been [...] "humorous, not serious." [...] Another source said Bush was [...] "deadly serious." [...] The UK government refuses to publish the memo and two civil servants have been charged with violating Britain's Official Secrets Act for allegedly disclosing the document. For a more full discussion, see Al Jazeera bombing memo.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 May, it was {{revealed}} that the British Government rejected a proposal by the Palestinian Authority to use force in a possible rescue attempt to free Johnston, due to worries about his safety in such a situation. Ismail Haniyeh also said that progress had been made in negotiations with Johnston's kidnappers, and the kidnappers had lowered their demands for his release. The same day, British Prime Minister Tony Blair was questioned in Parliament about British efforts to free the journalist. Lee Scott, a British MP, had called on <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Blair</b> to use the time before he stepped down from office to try to free Johnston as well as Gilad Shalit. Blair told the House of Commons that there was [...] "no conceivable reason for him (Johnston) to be kept", and that the Government would [...] "continue {{to do everything we can}} to facilitate" [...] Johnston's release.

2500|$|At the FOI appeal {{tribunal}} in September 2010, Paul Richards, {{a former}} special {{adviser to the}} former communities secretary Hazel Blears and health secretary Patricia Hewitt, {{said that it was}} clear to him that Charles regularly corresponded with ministers and these letters went [...] "to the top of the pile" [...] and are [...] "treated with great reverence." [...] This is in contrast to letters from ordinary citizens, which [...] "...go through a centralised mailroom and which are normally dealt with by departmental staff and rarely seen by ministers or their advisers." [...] Richards had been a special adviser from 2005–09 and said that Charles wrote on issues including planning applications and government health policy. Richards believed that lobbying from Charles had contributed to a £1.1m grant awarded to his Foundation for Integrated Health. Richards believed that the grant arose after [...] "behind-the-scenes lobbying" [...] from Charles, and occurred {{at the same time as}} a reception hosted by the prince at his London residence, Clarence House, attended by at least one health minister and an adviser to <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Blair.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Prime Minister Tony Blair {{personally}} urged for a calm mediation {{between both}} sides. [...] "I entirely understand the desire, and indeed need, for Israel {{to defend itself}} properly and I also understand the plight of Lebanon and the Lebanese government, {{not to say the}} many Palestinians that suffer as well," [...] he said. [...] "The only way {{we are going to get}} this situation resolved is if we support the UN mission, get some calm into the situation and then as soon as possible... get back in to the road map towards a two-state solution that offers the only chance for stability and peace in the future." [...] Blair also underscored the tragedy that the crisis has brought to the region. [...] "What is happening is absolutely tragic for all the people involved, but the only solution is that the international community empowers the moderates on both sides to come to a solution." [...] On 16 July, <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Blair</b> blamed Iran and Syria for the flare-up in the Middle East.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, British Prime Minister Tony Blair advised Queen Elizabeth II {{to confer}} on Black a life peerage {{with the title}} of Baron Black of Crossharbour. He would sit as a {{conservative}} peer, and his name had been put forward by the then conservative leader, William Hague. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien advised the Queen not to appoint Black a peer, citing the Nickle Resolution of 1919 and a long history since then of objections to Canadian citizens accepting British peerages. Black at the time held both Canadian and British citizenship. Black {{pointed out that the}} Nickle Resolution referred to Canadian resident citizens, not dual citizens living in the U.K and was not binding, but when <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Blair</b> said the Queen would prefer not to choose between the conflicting recommendations of two prime ministers of countries of which she was the monarch, Black asked that the matter be deferred. He litigated in Canada, claiming that Chrétien had no jurisdiction to create a class of citizen in another country, consisting of one person (as there were other dual citizens in the House of Lords), ineligible to receive an honour in that country for services deemed to have been rendered in that country, because of the personal objections of the Canadian Prime Minister of the day. Later in 2001, after the Ontario Superior Court and Court of Appeal had ruled that they had no jurisdiction in this area, Black renounced his Canadian citizenship, remaining a United Kingdom citizen, which allowed him to accept the peerage without further controversy.|$|E
