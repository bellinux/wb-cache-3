5|$|In late December {{the last}} of the {{survivors}} that were able to be extricated were pulled from the fallen buildings, rescue operations ceased, and the cleanup began, beginning with the destruction of buildings that were too heavily damaged to be repaired. Six friends were {{in the basement of a}} nine-story building relocating barrels when it came down around them on December 7. Their injuries were minor, but one <b>person</b> <b>did</b> suffer a broken arm. They sustained themselves on the food supplies—fruit salad, pickles, and smoked ham—that were available in the basement for 35 days before their rescue in January.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} those who killed in error went into {{banishment}}. One would go into banishment if, for example, while one was pushing a roller on a roof, the roller slipped over, fell, and killed someone. One would go into banishment if while one was lowering a cask, it fell down and killed someone. One would go into banishment if while coming down a ladder, one fell and killed someone. But one would not go into banishment if while pulling up the roller it fell back and killed someone, or while raising a bucket the rope snapped and the falling bucket killed someone, or while going up a ladder one fell down and killed someone. The Mishnah's general principle was that whenever the death occurred {{in the course of}} a downward movement, the culpable person went into banishment, but if the death did not occur {{in the course of a}} downward movement, the <b>person</b> <b>did</b> not go into banishment. If while chopping wood, the iron slipped from the ax handle and killed someone, Rabbi taught that the <b>person</b> <b>did</b> not go into banishment, but the sages said that the <b>person</b> <b>did</b> go into banishment. If from the split log rebounding killed someone, Rabbi said that the person went into banishment, but the sages said that the <b>person</b> <b>did</b> not go into banishment.|$|E

Instances of work with rural boys and girls can be found all throughout the 19th century. In the spring of 1882, Delaware College announced a statewide corn contest for boys, in which each boy was to plant a quarter of an acre, according to instructions sent out from the college, and cash prizes, certificates, and subscriptions to the American Agriculturalist were rewarded.|$|E
25|$|Tuesday's Task: When Eric was {{nominated}} for Thursday's eviction, his Tuesday night task was to flatter and {{do whatever it takes}} to make sure a specific <b>person</b> <b>did</b> not vote to evict him, and he completed this task if that person voted to evict the other nominee. When Eric was not nominated, then his Tuesday night task was to target one of the two nominees for eviction. Eric automatically voted for the winner of the AP poll, and he completed the task if the majority of HouseGuests voted to evict the same player he had been instructed to target. Eric successfully completed five of the eight tasks involving persuading the house to evict a nominee. The one time Eric was on the block and had to flatter Dick to secure their vote, he chose not to.|$|E

25|$|Consensual sexual {{intercourse}} over the 3-year age difference (where the minor is 13 to 15 years old) would subject the older party to {{a charge of}} Sexual Assault, 2nd Degree, in violation of C.G.S. §53a-71(a)(1). Any juvenile offender 14 years old or older has the case automatically transferred to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court by operation of law, and thus stands before the court to be tried as an adult. See C.G.S. §46b-127(a). A guilty verdict would result in conviction of a Class B felony sex offense, with a mandatory minimum of 9 months and maximum 20 years imprisonment. It would not matter if the older <b>person</b> <b>did</b> not know of the age difference, or if the younger person lied about age. However, if the offender is 17 years old or younger, has a clean record, and such sexual activity was consensual, Youthful Offender status (a pre-trial diversionary program that seals the court record and results in a dismissal of charges) may be granted. See C.G.S. §54-76b to o.|$|E
25|$|Insulae {{have been}} the subject of great debate for historians of Roman culture, {{defining}} the various meanings of the word. Insula was a word used to describe apartment buildings, or the apartments themselves, meaning apartment, or inhabitable room, demonstrating just how small apartments for Plebes were. Urban divisions were originally street blocks, and later began to divide into smaller divisions, the word insula referring to both blocks and smaller divisions. The insula contained cenacula, tabernae, storage rooms under the stairs, and lower floor shops. Another type of housing unit for Plebes was a cenaculum, an apartment, divided into three individual rooms: cubiculum, exedra, and medianum. Common Roman apartments were mainly masses of smaller and larger structures, many with narrow balconies that present mysteries as to their use, having no doors to access them, and they lacked the excessive decoration and display of wealth that aristocrats’ houses contained. Luxury in houses was not common, as the life of the average <b>person</b> <b>did</b> not consist of being in their houses, as they instead would go to public baths, and engage in other communal activities.|$|E

500|$|While the {{unauthorized}} wear or {{sale of the}} Medal of Honor {{has been}} a punishable offense under federal law since the early 20th century, the Stolen Valor Act criminalized the act of not only wearing, but also verbally claiming entitlement to military awards that a <b>person</b> <b>did</b> not in fact earn. In United States v. Alvarez (2012), the Supreme Court struck down the Act, ruling that the First Amendment bars the government from punishing people for making false claims regarding military service or honors where the false claim was not [...] "made to effect a fraud or secure moneys or other valuable considerations." [...] The decision was a 6–3 ruling, but the six justices in the majority could not agree on a single rationale for it.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of the satraps were of Persian origin and {{were members of the}} royal house or the six great noble families. These satraps were personally picked by Darius to monitor these provinces. Each of these provinces were divided into sub-provinces with their own governors which were chosen either by the royal court or by the satrap. To assess tributes, a commission evaluated the expenses and revenues of each satrap. To ensure that one <b>person</b> <b>did</b> not gain too much power, each satrap had a secretary who observed the affairs of the state and communicated with Darius, a treasurer who safeguarded provincial revenues and a garrison commander who was responsible for the troops. Additionally, royal inspectors who were the [...] "eyes and ears" [...] of Darius completed further checks on each satrap.|$|E

The entry was Amann's fourth episode written for the series, after season seven's [...] "Rush" [...] and [...] "Chimera" [...] and season eight's [...] "Invocation". Executive producer John Shiban later explained that, since Doggett and Reyes were {{in control of the}} X-Files, the producers needed to give one of them a drive. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz was interested in taking Annabeth Gish's character into a darker area. According to Mat Hurwitz and Chris Knowles in their book The Complete X-Files, the episode deals with themes of [...] "reincarnation and the idea of karmic justice." [...] Shiban noted that the conceit of the episode was whether Reyes was [...] "a good person or a bad <b>person?</b> <b>Did</b> she fight evil, or did she let evil happen." [...] It has been noted that the episode's plot is similar to mythology surrounding the Aztec agriculture god Xipe Totec. In mythology, Xipe Totec is often represented wearing a flayed human skin, usually with the flayed skin of the hands falling loose from the wrists.|$|E
