40|$|To {{facilitate}} long-term {{preservation and}} sustain {{the utility of}} <b>phonograph</b> <b>records,</b> an efficient and economical workflow management system for digitization is necessary. We describe in this paper the digitization process for building an online digital collection of <b>phonograph</b> <b>records</b> and our procedure for creating the ground-truth data, which is essential for developing an efficient metadata and content capturing system. We also discuss the challenges of defining metadata for <b>phonograph</b> <b>records</b> and their packaging to enhance access and use across traditional boundaries...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} new metadata design, {{as part of}} a large digitization management system being developed, to assist in the consistent creation of digital <b>libraries</b> of <b>phonograph</b> <b>records.</b> The Metadata provides digital libraries with an effective tool for the description, discovery, management, control, delivery, and sharing of digital objects of <b>phonograph</b> <b>record.</b> The metadata design is the outcome of two pilot projects for the digitization of <b>phonograph</b> <b>records</b> that took place at the Marvin Duchow Music Library at McGill University. The new design offers an approach to maintaining and using digital sound and ensures the long-term viability of digital <b>libraries</b> of <b>phonograph</b> <b>records.</b> The dissertation discusses key areas of preservation and addresses the most common retrieval problems of music in digital libraries. These problems include challenges in the digital context of bibliographic control, cataloging, distribution, and copyright protection. The dissertation revisits traditional cataloging approaches, summarizes historical music cataloging and metadata development, sets up preservation principles and rationales for digitizing <b>phonograph</b> <b>records,</b> and presents state-of-the-art techniques for preserving <b>phonograph</b> <b>records</b> in the digital domain. The dissertation contains three main parts. The first is an introduction to the new metadata design for <b>phonograph</b> <b>records.</b> The second is a metadata dictionary, which assigns precise syntactic and semantic meanings to metadata elements, to guide digitizers working in libraries, archives, museums, and heritage sectors. These will be followed by two case studies of <b>phonograph</b> <b>record</b> digitization projects using the Metadata and the Data Dictionary. The dissertation concludes by examining three challenges that are critical to future development in both the preserving of and access to phonograph records: the issue of interoperability between different metadata standards, the need for usability and quality evaluation of digitization management systems, and the importance of further development in digital library retrieval services and tools...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first Optical Audio Reconstruction (OAR) approach {{for the long-term}} digital preservation of stereo <b>phonograph</b> <b>records.</b> OAR uses precision metrology and digital image processing to obtain and convert groove contour data into digital audio for access and preservation. This contactless and imaging-based approach has considerable advantages over the traditional mechanical methods, such as being the only optical method {{with the potential to}} restore broken stereo records. Although past efforts on monophonic <b>phonograph</b> <b>records</b> have been successful, no attempts on 33 rpm long-playing stereo records (LPs) have been reported. By using a white-light interferometry optical profiler, we are able to extract stereo audio information encoded in the 3 D profile of the <b>phonograph</b> <b>record</b> grooves. 1...|$|R
