40|$|BACKGROUND: The study {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the relationship between pronuclei morphology scoring (PNMS) and the chromosomal complement of embryos in couples with severe male infertility undergoing ICSI. A total of 3116 <b>pre-embryos</b> was scored according to PNMS in 452 cycles. METHODS: <b>Pre-embryos</b> were classified into eight categories based on the alignment, size, linear or irregular distribution of pronuclear bodies (PNB), position and clarity of cytoplasmic halo and abutting of the pronucleus. These categories were subdivided into groups I and II according to the similarity and distribution of PNB. RESULTS: In total, 2574 <b>pre-embryos</b> formed by using ejaculated sperm, while 542 <b>pre-embryos</b> developed by injection of testicular sperm or round spermatids. More group II <b>pre-embryos</b> with markedly different morphology from group I were formed after ICSI with testicular sperm than with fresh ejaculated sperm (32. 1 versus 22. 7 %, P < 0. 01). Of 490 <b>pre-embryos</b> in which pronuclear morphology was evaluated, 263 were biopsied for preimplantation genetic diagnosis. The rate of chromosomal abnormality was higher in embryos developed from group II <b>pre-embryos</b> (52. 2 %) than in embryos developed from group I prezygotes (37. 6 %, P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Group II <b>pre-embryos</b> had markedly different morphology from group I, and had a low rate of blastocyst formation and high risk of chromosomally abnormal embryos.

40|$|Early {{pregnancy}} factor (EPF) {{was first}} {{described as a}} pregnancy-associated substance, although recent studies suggest a more general link with cell development. It {{is a product of}} actively dividing cells and its apparent functional importance to them suggests its potential as a regulator of cell proliferation. The recent discovery of EPF in platelets has provided a comparatively rich and readily available source of EPF. The purification procedures employed to isolate EPF from this source have also been applied to pregnancy serum and urine, medium conditioned by oestrous mouse ovaries (stimulated with prolactin and embryo-conditioned medium), medium conditioned by tumour cells, and serum from rats 24 h after partial hepatectomy (PH). In all instances, biological activity followed the same pattern throughout. Furthermore, the final active reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography fraction from all sources was bound specifically by immobilized anti-EPF monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), indicating that the active fractions produced from these diverse sources are very closely related, if not identical. Some differences have been observed in the behaviour of EPF in various conditions. EPF is produced by proliferating tumour cells and by liver cells post-PH, and passive immunization studies with anti-EPF MAbs have shown that these cells need EPF for survival. In contrast, EPF has not been detected as a product of the <b>pre-embryo,</b> and addition of anti-EPF MAbs to embryo cultures does not adversely affect development from the 2 -cell to the blastocyst stage. Although the <b>pre-embryo</b> is not dependent on EPF for its development in vitro, neutralization of EPF in vivo by anti-EPF MAbs retards its development. Thus, EPF appears to play an indirect role in maintaining the <b>pre-embryo.</b> By virtue of its ability to suppress the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, {{it has been suggested that}} EPF might act as an immunological response modifier of the maternal immune system. Alternatively, the effect of EPF on lymphocytes may be to reduce the expression of all or some cytokines and this could inhibit development. Whether or not EPF acts more directly as an autocrine growth factor from around the time of implantation, when the embryo first begins synthesis of EPF, is not known and remains to be investigated...|$|E

40|$|The spindle {{apparatus}} and the zona pellucida are two essential organelles in oocytes, {{which can be}} viewed by PolScope microscopy non-invasively, due to their composition of molecularly ordered, paracrystalline fibres. The {{spindle apparatus}} {{is responsible for the}} high fidelity of chromosome segregation during oogenesis. Disturbances in spindle assembly increase the risk of chromosome mal-segregation in oocytes. Accordingly, oocytes possessing a birefringent spindle in PolScope microscopy tend to have a better developmental potential compared to those without a spindle. The zona pellucida is an extracellular matrix surrounding mammalian oocytes and pre-implantation embryos with an essential role in oocyte development, fertilization and implantation. Failures in expression of zona proteins correlate to subfertility or infertility in animals. Low expression of the zona proteins by the growing human oocyte may indicate reduced developmental potential. Retardance of light and magnitude of birefringence is linearly correlated to number and alignment of microtubules. Therefore, high mean retardance magnitude may reflect oocytes with healthy, robust spindle and/or zona pellucida that have a high developmental potential. Low birefringence might be indicative of structures with few and unaligned fibres and oocytes with lower developmental capacity. To test this notion, the current study employed PolScope microscopy in the IVF centre of Giessen University to non-invasively and quantitatively assess spindle and zona morphology in living human oocytes before they were subjected to intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Quality and viability of the embryos after insemination of oocytes with high or low birefringence was compared retrospectively. In total, oocytes from 182 stimulated ICSI cycles were screened by PolScope after informed consent of patients. For the assessment of spindle morphology and texture, 676 oocytes (mean age of patients was 32. 5 ± 4. 4 years) were analysed that developed into <b>pre-embryos</b> and were assessed for PN scores to select embryos for transfer, blindly with respect to spindle birefringence. Mean magnitude of retardance of spindles and pole-to-pole length was retrospectively compared between all oocytes giving rise to high or low PN score embryos, and was also analysed with respect to maternal age. Mean retardance was also compared between oocytes developing into non-transfer embryos and those selected for transfer after ICSI, respectively. For the assessment of the zona morphology and texture, retardance magnitude and thickness of the inner, middle and outer layers of the ZP were quantitatively analysed by PolScope in 166 oocytes selected for transfer after ICSI (63 of the 103 cycles; mean age 32. 8 ± 4. 4 years) on the basis of pronuclear score at day 1. Blastomere number was determined at day 2. Data were compared between oocytes giving rise to conception cycles (CC; 65 oocytes/ 23 cycles) and non-conception cycles (NCC; 101 oocytes/ 40 cycles) and with respect to maternal age. Results of the spindle analysis showed that magnitude of light retardance by the oocyte spindle was positively correlated to embryo quality after ICSI according to PN score in the IVF centre in Giessen. Good PN score <b>pre-embryos</b> were from oocytes with significantly higher birefringent spindles compared to lower PN score <b>pre-embryos</b> (P < 0. 001). In addition, oocytes developing to <b>pre-embryos</b> with very poor quality had a significantly shorter spindle compared to those forming embryos with highest PN score (P < 0. 001). Mean retardance was significantly higher in spindles of oocytes selected for transfer compared to non-transfer oocytes (P < 0. 001). There was no clear relationship between maternal age and mean retardance in the cohort containing few patients &# 8805; 36 years. Zona pellucida scoring revealed three distinctly different layers of the extracellular coat surrounding the human oocyte, whereas the zona appeared comparatively translucent, when viewed by a conventional light microscope equipped with Hoffmann interference optics. Embryos in the CC group tended to develop faster. The thickness of the inner zona layer was significantly different (P < 0. 001), and the mean magnitude of light retardance was nearly 30 % higher (P < 0. 001) in the inner layer of the zona pellucida of oocytes contributing to a CC compared to a NCC. Nearly 90 % percent of the oocytes containing a ZP with a mean retardance magnitude over 3. 0 nm of the inner ZP layer contributed to a CC, significantly more compared with the NCC (c²-test, P < 0. 001). In conclusion, the study shows that oocytes with a high mean retardance of light by the spindle develop into <b>pre-embryos</b> with good PN score. This finding has been confirmed by a small cohort of 59 oocytes from an IVF centre in Milano, Italy. PN-scoring was originally developed to identify presumably high quality embryos and may be predictive for aneuploidy. Since PN-scoring cannot be used for selection in some counties due to ethical and legal considerations, analysis of mean spindle retardance by PolScope microscopy may be as useful as PN-scoring to identify oocytes with higher or lower developmental potential, and combining with PN-scoring may provide additional information on oocyte health and quality. A high birefringent and thick ZP is related to the presence of a dense coat of highly ordered ZP filaments and thus appears to reflect health and developmental potential of an oocyte. The mean magnitude of light retardance by the ZP inner layer presents a new, unique, non-invasive marker for embryo viability after ICSI. Combining screening for birefringence of the spindle apparatus and the zona pellucida together with other methods like PN-scoring, analysis of oocytes by quantitative PolScope microscopy may contribute significantly to identify the highest quality oocytes in ICSI cycles, to reduce multiple embryo transfers, and to improve oocyte handling and treatment of patients...|$|R

Estudos prévios mostraram que a administração de levonorgestrel a ratas lactando causou nas crias retardo de puberdade em machos e alterações no peso de oviduto e útero. OBJETIVO: Estudar a capacidade reprodutiva das fêmeas F 1, de mães tratadas com levonorgestrel. MÉTODOS: Ratas Wistar foram tratadas com levonorgestrel (0. 030 mg/ 1 ml de água destilada) do 7 º ao 13 º dia após o nascimento (dia 1 = nascimento). Aos 90 dias, as fêmeas F 1 foram acasaladas com machos férteis e a inseminação comprovada pela presença de espermatozóides no esfregaço vaginal (primeiro dia de prenhez). As fêmeas inseminadas foram distribuídas em três lotes de 20 animais (10 F 1 Controles e 10 F 1 Tratadas). Os animais foram sacrificados no 2 º, 4 º e 5 º dias após a inseminação, por excesso de inalação com éter, e os ovários, ovidutos e cornos uterinos foram removidos. Os ovários foram pesados e os corpos lúteos contados. Ovidutos e cornos uterinos foram lavados com solução fisiológica e os pré-embriões obtidos foram contados e examinados em cada um dos segmentos. RESULTADOS: O peso de ovários, número de corpos lúteos, número e fase de desenvolvimento de pré-embriões foram semelhantes nos dois grupos.

Although progress in genetic research has several advantages, it gives couples the freedom to have children when they would not be able to without prenatal tracking, but the freedom to procreate must still remain in the foreground...|$|E
40|$|URL] period. When the {{elongating}} gynophore pushes 2 College of Agriculture, Shandong University, Jinan 250100, PR China Full list {{of author}} {{information is available}} {{at the end of the}} articleBackground Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is a world-wide important crop both for oil and protein production. In recent years, great advances have been achieved in peanut functional genomics, proteomics, molecular marker development and other biotechnological based research areas. However, little studies focused on understanding the key biological processes in peanut plants as for instance, the molecular mechanism of peanut geocarpy, which was investigated from the physiological aspect in last century [1 - 6]. Peanut flowers and finishes pollination above ground as other plants. After fertilization, the activity of an intercalary meristem at the base of the ovary leads to the formation of a gynophore. It carries the ovary and grows in a positive geotropic manner [7]. The zygote cell divides only few times and then both the <b>pre-embryo</b> and pod development are arrested in continuous sun light or regular day/nigh...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{elucidate}} the etiologies of discordant trisomy 21 in monozygotic twin pregnancy. Case report: A monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy with hydrops and cleft lip (twin 1) found in one fetus presented at gestational age of 17 weeks. Amniotic fluid karyotyping showed nonmosaic trisomy 21 in twin 1 (47, XY, + 21 [20]) and a normal karyotype in twin 2 (46, XY [20]). Short tandem repeat (STR) polymorphism markers {{revealed that the}} two fetuses were monozygotic, and the two chromosomes 21 were maternal isodisomy in the trisomy fetus. The chromosomal constitution of placentas in the territory of trisomy 21 cotwin was 47, XY, + 21 [20] and was a mosaic 47, XY+ 21 [12]/ 46, XY [8] in the normal karyotyped twin. Conclusion: Our case of monozygotic twin with discordant trisomy 21 might start with a prezygotic maternal meiosis II non-disjunction error-caused trisomy 21 zygote, and after twinning, one remained trisomy 21, and the other twin underwent trisomy rescue and became a mosaic trisomy 21 in morula or early blastocyst stage before the formation of <b>pre-embryo,</b> which subsequently resulted in mosaic trisomy 21 of the placental tissue and normal chromosomal constitution of the fetus...|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to assess a sample of obstetrician-gynecologists on their {{technical}} knowledge of PGD as well as their views of PGD and sex selection (SS). Study design: Cross-sectional observational study, carried out during a Congress on Gynecology and Obstetrics. A self-report questionnaire was offered to all professionals registered to attend the Congress and answers of 723 physicians were analyzed. Results: of the participants, 436 (60. 3 %) were female and 287 (39. 7 %) were male; 517 (71. 5 %) had children. Regarding knowledge of PGD techniques, 63. 2 % had heard something about PGD and/or preconception SS. Concerning SS, physicians believed that SS is always the couple's choice (36. 4 %), should be the couple's choice only in specific situations (42. 6 %), or did not agree that SS should be a couple's choice (17. 4 %). A majority of the respondents were in favor of PGD and believed that <b>pre-embryos</b> with 6 - 8 cells are human life in potency. Conclusions: in spite of a small percentage of gynecologists-obstetricians in Brazil had knowledge of PGD techniques, many of them recognized it to be a method to prevent genetic diseases and agreed with its use. the SS appears to be highly accepted for use in specific situations.

40|$|Propagation of Coffea arabica L. {{through direct}} and {{indirect}} somatic embryogenesis technique is promising for producing large number of coffee seedlings. The objectives of the research were to evaluate methods for {{direct and indirect}} somatic embryo-genesis induction of C. arabica var. Kartika. The explants were the youngest fully expanded leaves of arabica coffee. The evalu-ated medium was modified Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented {{with a combination of}} 2. 26 µM 2, 4 -D + 4. 54 or 9. 08 µM thidiazuron; 4. 52 µM 2, 4 -D + 4. 54 or 9. 08 µM thidiazuron; or 9. 04 µM 2, 4 -D + 9. 08 µM thidiazuron. Both calli (100 mg) and <b>pre-embryos</b> developed from the edge of leaf explants were subcultured into regeneration medium (half strength MS with modified vitamin, supplemented with kinetine 9. 30 µM and adenine sulfate 40 mg L- 1). The results showed coffee leaf explant cultured on medium containing 2. 26 µM 2, 4 -D + 4. 54 or 9. 08 µM thidiazuron to induce direct somatic embriogenesis from explant, while that of 4. 52 or 9. 04 µM 2, 4 -D + 9. 08 µM thidiazuron to induced indirect somatic embrio-genesis. The medium for calli induction from coffee by explants was medium supplemented with 4. 52 or 9. 04 µM 2, 4 -D in combination with 9. 08 µM thidiazuron. On the other hand, the best medium for activation of induction of somatic embryos was MS medium supplemented with 9. 04 µM 2, 4 -D + 9. 08 µM thidiazuron. Based on this results, the first step for developing micropropagation for coffee has been resolved. The subsequent studies will be directed to evaluate agronomic performance of the derived planting materials...|$|R
40|$|Abstract__ In vitro {{fertilization}} (IVF), literally meaning ‘fertilization in glass’, {{is characterized by}} co-culture of aspired oocytes with spermatozoa and subsequent transfer of the embryo(s) into the uterine cavity. The original indication for this treatment was subfertility resulting from impaired function of the fallopian tubes (Steptoe 1975). Since then, indications for the usage of IVF have increased considerably (Diedrich et al. 1992; Macklon et al. 1991). The first efforts {{in the field of}} IVF in human were made in the 1940 ’s. By incubating surgically harvested oocytes with spermatozoa in vitro, two-cell <b>pre-embryos</b> were observed (Rock & Menkin 1944). These embryos were not transferred into the uterus. A major breakthrough was achieved in 1959 by the fertilization of rabbit eggs in vitro and subsequently transferring the four-cell embryos into the fallopian tubes of recipient rabbits, followed by the delivery of healthy rabbits (Chang 1959). This was the first proof that the concept of fertilizing mammalian eggs in vitro could produce normal offspring. The first attemps in IVF were characterized by the use of polyovulating agents and aspiration of human oocytes by laparoscopy resulting in an ectopic pregnancy (Steptoe & Edwards 1976). This technique failed to result in a life-born baby and was temporary abandoned. Edwards and Steptoe resorted to retrieving the single egg characteristics of the normal menstrual cycle. As a consequence, the best result was the recovery of solely one oocyte. On the 25 th of July 1978 the first baby arising from IVF, Louise Brown, was born in the U. K. (Steptoe & Edwards 1978). Unfortunately, by aspirating the oocyte in the natural cycle only a few pregnancies were reported. Subsequently, the use of human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) to stimulate multiple follicular development was re-introduced with more success (Garcia et al. 1983 a; Garcia et al. 1983 b) ...|$|R
