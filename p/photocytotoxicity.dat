40|$|In {{the present}} study, protohypericin was {{synthesised}} {{in order to}} compare its intrinsic <b>photocytotoxicity</b> with that of hypericin. The experimental work was performed in specific filtered light conditions that prevented both an unintended photoconversion of protohypericin and photosensitization of the cells. Assessing the <b>photocytotoxicity</b> {{as a function of}} irradiation time, {{it was found that the}} <b>photocytotoxicity</b> of both compounds converged after a long irradiation time (i. e., 15 min), while the difference between the photocytotoxicities was maximal after a short irradiation time (i. e., 1 min). Since this could not be accounted for by a redistribution of protohypericin during irradiation, and the different irradiation times corresponded to different degrees of photoconversion of protohypericin into hypericin, the results clearly suggest that protohypericin exhibits intrinsically a dramatically lower photoactivity as compared to hypericin. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Three assay {{models were}} adopted for {{assessing}} the <b>photocytotoxicity</b> of hypericin on A 431 cells. The cells were incubated for 1 hour or 24 hours with hypericin to evaluate {{the importance of the}} incubation period on the exerted <b>photocytotoxicity.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: A neutral red, an antiproliferative and a tetrazolium-reduction (MTT) assay were used for the estimation of cytotoxicity. RESULTS: IC 50 values were 296, 321 and > 500 nM after 1 hour, and to 70, 54 and 277 nM after 24 hours, for the neutral red, antiproliferative and MTT assays, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results clearly show that it is imperative to incubate cells for long periods to fully assess the hypericin <b>photocytotoxicity,</b> and that the neutral red assay is as sensitive as the antiproliferative assay but superior to the MTT assay at detecting hypericin cell damage. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{study the}} in vitro <b>photocytotoxicity</b> and {{cellular}} uptake of biodegradable polymeric micelles loaded with the photosensitizer mTHPC, including {{the effect of}} lipase-catalyzed micelle degradation. Methods. Micelles of mPEG 750 -b-oligo(ɛ-caprolactone) 5 (mPEG 750 -b-OCL 5) with a hydroxyl (OH), benzoyl (Bz) or naphthoyl (Np) end group were formed and loaded with mTHPC by the film hydration method. The cellular uptake of the loaded micelles, and their <b>photocytotoxicity</b> on human neck squamous carcinoma cells in the absence and presence of lipase were compared with free and liposomal mTHPC (Fospeg ®). Results. Micelles composed of mPEG 750 -b-OCL 5 with benzoyl and naphtoyl end groups had the highest loading capacity up to 30 % (w/w), likely due to π–π interactions between the aromatic end group and the photosensitizer. MTHPC-loaded benzoylated micelles (0. 5 mg/mL polymer) did not display <b>photocytotoxicity</b> or any mTHPC-uptake by the cells, in contrast to free and liposomal mTHPC. After dilution of the micelles below the critical aggregation concentration (CAC), or after micelle degradation by lipase, <b>photocytotoxicity</b> and cellular uptake of mTHPC were restored. Conclusion. The high loading capacity of the micelles, the high stability of mTHPC-loaded micelles above the CAC, and the lipase-induced release of the photosensitizer makes these micelles very promising carriers for photodynamic therapy in vivo.

40|$|International audiencePhotodynamic therapy (PDT) {{is a poor}} {{treatment}} {{option for}} nodular basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. As a result, the search for new photosensitizers with better effectiveness is of current interest. The <b>photocytotoxicity</b> of conjugates (P-R) of a water-soluble tri-cationic porphyrin (P-H) having similar efficiency of production of singlet oxygen, the PDT cytotoxin, has been assessed Links between uptake, intracellular localization, photooxidative stress, <b>photocytotoxicity</b> and ability to induce programmed cell death are established. Conjugates bearing methyl (P-Me), Di-O-isopropylidene-(-D-galactopyranosyl (P-OGal) or -dicyclohexylureidooxycarbonyl (P-DDC) chains are efficiently taken-up by proliferating NCTC 2544 keratinocytes. The relative order of <b>photocytotoxicity</b> is P-OGal >P-DDC=P-Me >> P-H. The photocytotoxic potential of P-Me, P-OGal and P-DDC equals that of endogenous protoporphyrin IX induced by δ-aminolevulinic acid or its esters, the pro-drugs currently employed for PDT of skin lesions. Microfluorometry shows that P-Me, P-OGal, and P-DDC localize in endocytotic or pinocytotic vesicles but not in mitochondria or nucleus. Absence of annexin V binding, caspase activation or chromatin condensation suggests that cell photosensitization by P-R does not induce apoptosis. On the other hand, P-OGal <b>photocytotoxicity</b> correlates with appearance of multiple vesicles that have hallmarks of autophagy compartments, being decorated with the marker LC 3 in cells transfected with an expression vector encoding GFP-LC 3. p 38 and JNK phosphorylation and inhibition of ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation suggest close relationship between mortality of NCTC 2544 keratinocytes and MAPK pathway impairment.

40|$|A novel {{series of}} silicon(IV) phthalocyanines {{substituted}} axially {{with one or}} two 1, 3 -bis(dimethylamino) - 2 -propoxy group(s) are described in Chapter 3. These compounds are essentially non-aggregated in common organic solvents and show a weak fluorescence emission, while their methylated derivatives are also non-aggregated even in aqueous media and exhibit a strong fluorescence emission. The <b>photocytotoxicities</b> of these compounds against HepG 2 and J 774 cells have also been investigated. These new phthalocyanines, in particular the unsymmetrical and amphiphilic analogues, are highly potent with IC 50 values down to 20 nM. The cellular uptake and subcellular localisation of these compounds have also been studied by fluorescence microscopy. The unsymmetric phthalocyanine SiPc[OC 3 H 5 (NMe 2) 2](OMe) has a high and selective affinity to the mitochondria of HepG 2 cells. Chapter 1 presents an overview of photodynamic therapy, including its historical development, current clinical status, and photophysical and biological mechanisms. Some representative photosensitisers are also reviewed. Chapter 2 describes two silicon(IV) phthalocyanines containing poly(ethylene glycol) chains at the axial positions, including their synthesis, spectroscopic characteristics and photophysical properties. Their complexation with bovine serum albumin and in vitro photodynamic activities towards HepG 2 human hepatocarcinoma cells and J 774 mouse macrophage are also reported. Chapter 4 discusses the photodynamic effects of a series of silicon(IV) phthalocyanines with different axial substituents against HT 29 and T 84 human colon adenocarcinoma cells, with the long-term goal of developing efficient photosensitising agents for colorectal cancer. While these compounds are not cytotoxic in the absence of light, they exhibit high <b>photocytotoxicities</b> with IC 50 values as low as 17 nM.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} {{different}} aspects of the chemistry of oxovanadium(IV) complexes, their interaction with DNA and protein and photo-induced DNA and protein cleavage activity and <b>photocytotoxicity.</b> Chapter I presents a general introduction on various modes of interactions of organic compounds and transition metal complexes capable of targeting DNA leading to DNA strand scission, emphasizing particularly the photo-induced DNA cleavage activities for their potential application in PDT. The mechanistic pathways associated with the DNA cleavage are discussed. A comparison has been made on the advantages of photoactive metal complexes over organic conjugates. Objective of the present investigation is also dealt in this Chapter. Chapter II of the thesis deals with the synthesis, characterization, DNA binding and photo-induced DNA cleavage activity of ternary oxovanadium(IV) complexes of N-salicylidene-S-methyldithiocarbazate (salmdtc) and phenanthroline bases to explore the photo-induced DNA cleavage activity in UV-A light of 365 nm. Chapter III presents the synthesis, characterization, DNA binding and photo-induced DNA cleavage activity of ternary oxovanadium(IV) complexes containing N-salicylidene-L-methionate (salmet) and N-salicylidene-L-tryptophanate (saltrp) Schiff bases and phenanthroline bases. The objective of this work is to investigate the photo-induced DNA cleavage activity in near-IR light and to see the effect of pendant thiomethyl and indole moieties in the DNA cleavage reactions. Chapter IV deals with the synthesis, characterization, DNA binding, red-light induced DNA cleavage activity and <b>photocytotoxicity</b> of ternary oxovanadium(IV) complexes having N-salicylidene-L-arginine (sal-argH) and N-salicylidene-L-lysine (sal-lysH) Schiff bases and phenanthroline bases. The important results include the visible light-induced DNA cleavage activity and <b>photocytotoxicity</b> of the complexes in human cervical HeLa cancer cells. Chapter V describes the synthesis, characterization, DNA binding and photo-induced DNA and protein cleavage activity and <b>photocytotoxicity</b> of oxovanadium(IV) complexes containing bis(2 -benzimidazolylmethyl) amine and phenanthroline bases. The significant results include DNA cleavage activity in near-IR light and <b>photocytotoxicity</b> of the dppz complex in non-small cell lung carcinoma/human lung adenocarcinoma A 549 cells in visible light. Further, we have studied the protein cleavage activity of the complexes in UV-A light of 365 nm by using bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lysozyme.

The goal {{of this study was}} the targeted delivery of Sn(IV) chlorin e 6 (SnCe 6) to tumours that overexpress the EGF receptor. Therefore EGF was conjugated to the photosensitizer through a carrier, such as dextran (Dex) and polyvinylalcohol (PVA). These conjugates were then compared to a conjugate of the photosensitizer to dextran or PVA alone. The EGF-Dex-SnCe 6 conjugates bound specifically to the EGF receptors of the human squamous carcinoma cell line A 431 in contrast to EGF-PVA-SnCe 6. However, EGF-PVA-SnCe 6 exhibited a higher <b>photocytotoxicity</b> (CC 50, 2. 8 microM) than EGF-Dex-SnCe 6 (CC 50, > 10 microM) and SnCe 6 (CC 50, > 10 microM). PVA-SnCe 6 had a similar <b>photocytotoxicity</b> (CC 50, 3. 5 microM) to EGF-PVA-SnCe 6, indicating that PVA, more than EGF, plays a determinant role in the uptake of the conjugates by A 431 cells. Together with the improved affinity of EGF-Dex-SnCe 6 over EGF-PVA-SnCe 6 for the EGF receptor, the former displayed a small increased <b>photocytotoxicity</b> over Dex-SnCe 6, reflecting a limited EGF receptor mediated uptake effect.

40|$|Three nanostructured {{vehicles}} are proposed as potential carriers for photosensitizers {{to be used}} in photodynamic therapy: spherical nanoparticles, hexahedral microparticles and cylindrical magnetic nanorods. A comparative study of their photodynamic properties was performed, and the influence of their size and the amount of loaded porphyrin was considered to discuss their effects in the observed photodynamic activity. All the vehicles have a gold surface, allowing functionalization with a disulfide-containing porphyrin as the photosensitizer, as well as with a PEG-containing thiol to improve their biocompatibility and water solubility. The activity of the porphyrin loaded in each vehicle was assessed through in vitro <b>photocytotoxicity</b> studies using HeLa cells. A synergic effect for the porphyrin toxicity was observed in all of the vehicles. The zinc-containing porphyrin showed better production of singlet oxygen, and proved more photocytotoxic both in solution and loaded in any of the vehicles. The magnetism of the nanorods allows targeting with a magnetic field, but causes their aggregation, hampering the porphyrin's activity.

In this work, {{we report on the}} study of the BCD <b>photocytotoxicity</b> toward melanoma and normal cells in comparison with that of commercial photosensitizer Photogem®. MethodsThe cytotoxic and phototoxic effects were measured by standard tests of cell viability. The drug uptake was obtained by the flow cytometry and optical absorption techniques. The BCD intracellular distribution was obtained by the fluorescence image microscopy using specific organelle markers. ResultsBoth drugs demonstrated increased cytotoxicity under irradiation, while in darkness their cytotoxic effect at concentrations lower than 20 μM after 24 h of incubation did not exceed 20 %. For 5 h of incubation, BCD <b>photocytotoxicity</b> in relation to melanoma cells reached 100 % already at concentrations below 5 μM, while for normal cells the effect did not exceed 70 % even for the 20 μM concentration. It is shown that BCD penetrates into the cells and is located predominantly in perinuclear cytoplasmic structures. ConclusionsThe BCD photosensitizing characteristics appear more adequate for application in PDT than that of the actually applied commercial photosensitizer Photogem®. Higher light absorption by BCD in the near IR region and its preferential localization in mitochondria can explain its high <b>photocytotoxicity.</b> General significanceBCD can be considered as a new promising photosensitizer class for cancer PDT...|$|E
40|$|Brazilian green {{propolis}} (BGP) {{is noted}} for its impressive antitumor effects and {{has been used as}} a folk medicine in various cultures for many years. It has been demonstrated that BGP could enhance the cytotoxic effect of cytostatic drugs on tumor cells. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a therapeutic approach used against malignant cells. To assess the synergistic effect of BGP extract on protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) -mediated <b>photocytotoxicity,</b> MTT assays were performed using A 431 and HeLa cells. TUNEL assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining were performed to confirm the induction of apoptosis. Western blotting analysis was performed to examine the pro-apoptotic proteins, anti-apoptotic proteins and inflammation related proteins in A 431 cells. Intracellular accumulation of PpIX was examined by flow cytometry. The synergistic effect of BGP extract in PpIX-PDT was also evaluated with a xenograft model. Our findings reveal that BGP extract increased PpIX-mediated <b>photocytotoxicity</b> in A 431 and HeLa cells. PpIX-PDT with BGP extract treatment resulted in a decrease in Bcl-xL and an increase in NOXA, Bax and caspase- 3 cleavage. The protein expression levels of p-IKKα/β, NF-κB and COX- 2 were upregulated by PpIX-PDT but significantly attenuated when in combination with BGP extract. BGP extract was also found to significantly enhance the intracellular accumulation of PpIX in A 431 cells. BGP extract increased PpIX-mediated <b>photocytotoxicity</b> in a xenograft model as well. Our findings provide evidence for a synergistic effect of BGP extract in PpIX-PDT both in vitro and in vivo...|$|E
40|$|This thesis work {{deals with}} {{different}} aspects of the chemistry of La(III) and Gd(III) complexes, their interaction with DNA and proteins, photo-induced cleavage of double-stranded DNA, photocytotoxic effect on cancer cells, cell death mechanism and cellular localization behaviour. Chapter I gives an introduction to the metal-based anticancer agents with special emphasis on clinically used drugs and the growing field of lanthanide therapeutics. An overview of the current strategies of cancer treatment, especially photodynamic therapy (PDT), is presented. Mode of small molecule-DNA interactions and the mechanistic aspects associated with DNA photodamage reactions and PDT effect are discussed with selected examples of compounds that are known to photocleave DNA on exposure to light of different wavelengths. A brief discussion on the various therapeutic applications of the lanthanide compounds is also made. Chapter II presents the synthesis, characterization, DNA binding, BSA binding, photo-induced DNA cleavage activity and <b>photocytotoxicity</b> of La(III) and Gd(III) complexes of phenanthroline bases to explore the UV-A light-induced DNA cleavage activity and <b>photocytotoxicity</b> of the complexes. Chapter III describes the synthesis, characterization, DNA binding, photo-induced DNA cleavage activity and <b>photocytotoxicity</b> of La(III) and Gd(III) complexes of phenanthroline bases with an aim to improve the design of the complexes to achieve better solution stability and DNA binding of the complexes. Chapter IV presents the synthesis, characterization, DNA binding, and UV-A light-induced DNA photocleavage activity and <b>photocytotoxicity</b> of La(III) and Gd(III) complexes of pyridyl phenanthroline bases with an objective to improve the photoactivity of the complexes by introducing an additional pyridyl group. Cell death mechanism and confocal microscopic studies are also carried out to gain more insight into the PDT effect caused by light {{in the presence of the}} complex. Chapter V describes the synthesis and characterization of La(III) and Gd(III) complexes of terpyridine bases and acetylacetonate to study the complexes as a new class of photosensitizers to explore their DNA photocleavage activity and <b>photocytotoxicity</b> in HeLa cells. Effect of attaching a glucose moiety to the acetyl acetone (Hacac) ligand has been studied. The cellular uptake behaviour of the La(III) pyrenyl-terpyridine complexes has also been investigated. Finally, Chapter VI presents the synthesis and characterization of curcumin and glycosylated curcumin La(III) and Gd(III) complexes having terpyridine base with an objective to study the photoactivated anticancer activity of the complexes in visible light. This chapter describes the visible light-induced DNA cleavage activity and <b>photocytotoxicity</b> of the complexes by exploiting curcumin and glycosylated curcumin as the photosensitizer ligands. Study on the cellular uptake behavior of curcumin La(III) complexes having pyrenyl terpyridine ligand is also presented. The references have been assembled at the end of each chapter and indicated as superscript numbers in the text. The complexes presented in this thesis are represented by bold-faced numbers. Crystallographic data of the complexes which are characterized structurally by single crystal X-ray crystallography are provided in CIF format in the enclosed CD (Appendix-I).

40|$|The <b>photocytotoxicity</b> of {{sulfonated}} phthalimidomethyl aluminum phthalocyanine, a more hydrophobic photosensitizer {{as compared}} to phthalocyanine substituted with sulfonate groups only, was investigated. Inclusion of 1 - 2 phthalimidomethyl groups into disulfonated aluminum phthalocyanine, resulted in increased partition coefficients between n-octanol and water, and a six-fold increase in both cellular uptake and <b>photocytotoxicity</b> towards Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells (line V- 79). Reducing the number of phthalimidomethyl groups, or increasing the degree of sulfonation, lead to {{a decrease in the}} partition coefficient, cellular uptake, and phototoxicity. The quantum yield of singlet oxygen was comparable for all dyes tested in this series, indicating that no significant change in this photophysical parameter resulted from phthalimidomethylation. These results suggest that the addition of 1 - 2 phthalimidomethyl groups to disulfonated aluminum phthalocyanine improves cellular uptake, but, as the relative efficiency of cell killing was not effected, the intracellular distribution on photosensitive molecules may not be modified...|$|E

The high-spin iron(III) complexes display Fe(III) /Fe(II) redox couple near - 0. 7 V versus {{saturated calomel electrode}} in dimethyl sulfoxide- 0. 1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate. The complexes show non-specific interaction with DNA as determined from the binding studies. Complexes with appended biotin moiety show similar binding to streptavidin as that of free biotin, suggesting biotin conjugation to dppz does not cause any loss in its binding affinity to streptavidin. The <b>photocytotoxicity</b> of the complexes is tested in HepG 2, HeLa and HEK 293 cell lines. Complex 2 shows higher <b>photocytotoxicity</b> in HepG 2 cells than in HeLa or HEK 293, forming reactive oxygen species.

40|$|Photodynamic {{therapy has}} {{attracted}} increasing interest {{over the last}} few years, whereby the activation of photosensitizers by light causes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as singlet oxygen, which are cytotoxic. The goal of our study was to enhance the photodynamic activity of the photosensitizer aluminum phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate (AlPcS 4) through its specific delivery to tumor cells. Since many tumor cells, among which are HeLa cells, overexpress the transferrin receptor, we synthesized transferrin conjugated PEG-liposomes that contained AlPcS 4 that could be internalized by receptor mediated endocytosis. The antiproliferative activity of the targeted liposomes was evaluated and compared to the native AlPcS 4 and the non-targeted liposome. These findings were supplemented with data on intracellular concentration of the photo-active compounds. The accumulation together with ROS production after irradiation was visualized by using confocal microscopy to confirm the data found in the antiproliferative and accumulation assay. Tf-Lip-AlPcS 4 was 10 times more photocytotoxic (IC(50), 0. 63 microM) than free AlPcS 4 at a light dose of 45 kJ/m whereas Lip-AlPcS 4 displayed no <b>photocytotoxicity</b> at all. The high <b>photocytotoxicity</b> of Tf-Lip-AlPcS 4 was shown {{to be the result of}} a high intracellular concentration (136. 5 microM) in HeLa cells, which could be lowered dramatically by incubating the conjugate with a competing transferrin concentration. The images of intracellular accumulation and ROS production matched the accumulation and <b>photocytotoxicity</b> profile of the different photo-active compounds. The photodynamic activity of the Tf-Lip-AlPcS 4 conjugate on HeLa cells is much more potent than free AlPcS 4 as a result of selective transferrin receptor mediated uptake. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Hypericin (HYP) is a {{naturally}} occurring photosensitizer. Cellular uptake and photodynamic inactivation after incubation with this photosensitizer have neither been examined in medulloblastoma cells in vitro, nor compared with 5 -aminolevulinic acid-derived protoporphyrin IX (5 -ALA-derived PpIX). Methods: In 3 medulloblastoma cell lines (D 283 Med, Daoy, and D 341 Med) the time- and concentration-dependent intracellular accumulation of HYP and 5 -ALA-derived PpIX was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (FM) and FACS. <b>Photocytotoxicity</b> was measured after illumination at 595 nm (HYP) and 635 nm (5 -ALA-derived PpIX) in D 283 Med cells and compared to U 373 MG glioma cells. Results: All medulloblastoma cell lines exhibited concentration- and time-dependent uptake of HYP. Incubation with HYP up to 10 mM {{resulted in a}} rapid increase in fluorescence intensity, which peaked between 2 and 4 hours. 5 -ALA-derived PpIX accumulation increased in D 283 Med cells by 22 % over baseline after 5 -ALA incubation up to 1. 2 mM. <b>Photocytotoxicity</b> of 5 -ALA-derived PpIX was higher in D 283 Med medulloblastoma compared to U 373 MG glioma. The LD 50 [lethal dose (light dose that is required to reduce cell survival to 50 % of control) ] of 5 -ALA-derived PpIX was 3. 8 J/cm 2 in D 283 Med cells versus 5. 7 J/cm 2 in U 373 MG glioma cells. <b>Photocytotoxicity</b> of HYP in D 283 Med cells was determined at 2. 5 mM after an incubation time of 2 h and an illumination wavelength of 595 nm.

A series of photoactivatable Pt-IV-azido complexes has been synthesized: The synthesis, characterization, and <b>photocytotoxicity</b> of six mixed-ligand ammine/amine Pt-IV diazido complexes, cis,trans,cis-[Pt(N- 3) (2) (OH) (2) (NH 3) (X) ] where X = propylarnine (4 c), butylamine (5 c), or pentylamine (6 c) and aromatic complexes where X = pyridine (7 c), 2 -methylpyridine (8 c), or 3 -methylpyridine (9 c) are reported. Six all-trans isomers have also been studied where X = methylamine (2 t), ethylamine (3 t), 2 -methylpyridine (8 t), 4 -methylpyridine (10 t), 3 -methylpyridine (9 t), and 2 -bromo- 3 -methylpyridine (11 t). All of the complexes exhibit intense azide-to-Pt-IV LMCT bands (ca. 290 nm for trans and ca. 260 nm for cis). When irradiated with UVA light (365 nm), the Pt-IV complexes undergo photoreduction to Pt-II species, as monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy. The trans isomers of complexes containing aliphatic or aromatic amines were more photocytotoxic than their cis isomers. One of the cis complexes (9 c) was nonphotocytotoxic despite undergoing photoreduction. Substitution of NH 3 ligands by MeNH 2 or EtNH 2 results in more potent <b>photocytotoxicity</b> for the all-trans complexes. The complexes were all nontoxic toward human keratinocytes (HaCaT) and A 2780 human ovarian cancer cells in the dark, apart from the 3 -methylpyridine (9 t), 2 -bromo- 3 -methylpyridine (11 t), and 4 -methylpyridine (10 t) derivatives. ...|$|E
