This {{was his last}} victory. Two weeks later his subordinate Gregorio García de la Cuesta routed the French defenders of Collioure, capturing that port. Ricardos returned to Madrid to plead for reinforcements and died there of pneumonia on 13 March 1794. His successor, Alejandro O'Reilly died on 23 March 1794, leaving Luis Firmín de Carvajal, Conde de la Unión {{in command of the}} Spanish army. De la Unión proved unable to stop the French from recovering Bellegarde and Collioure in 1794, and died at the Battle of the Black Mountain on Spanish soil in November.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown {{previously}} {{in a number of}} systems that after an extended block of activity, synaptic strength is increased. We found that an extended block of synaptic activity at the mouse neuromuscular junction, using a tetrodotoxin cuff in vivo, increased synaptic strength by prolonging the evoked endplate current (EPC) decay. <b>Prolongation</b> <b>of</b> EPC decay was accompanied by only modest <b>prolongation</b> <b>of</b> spontaneous miniature EPC (MEPC) decay. <b>Prolongation</b> <b>of</b> EPC decay was reversed when quantal content was lowered by reducing extracellular calcium. These findings suggested that the cause <b>of</b> EPC <b>prolongation</b> was presynaptic in origin. However, when we acutely inhibited fetal-type acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) using a novel peptide toxin (alphaA-conotoxin OIVA[K 15 N]), <b>prolongation</b> <b>of</b> both EPC and MEPC decay were reversed. We also blocked synaptic activity in a mutant strain of mice in which persistent muscle activity prevents upregulation of fetal-type AChRs. In these mice, there was no <b>prolongation</b> <b>of</b> EPC decay. We conclude that upregulation of fetal-type AChRs after blocking synaptic activity causes modest <b>prolongation</b> <b>of</b> MEPC decay that is accompanied by much greater <b>prolongation</b> <b>of</b> EPC decay. This might occur if acetylcholine escapes from endplates and binds to extrajunctional fetal-type AChRs only during large, evoked EPCs. Our study is the first to demonstrate a functional role for upregulation of extrajunctional AChRs...|$|R

We show that tangent functions of Lie group actions correspond to prolonged representations. We prove that if two representations are equivalent, then their prolongations are equivalent too. We show that if U is an invariant subspace for a representation, then TU is an invariant subspace for the <b>prolongation</b> <b>of</b> the given representation and vice versa.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{sought to}} {{determine}} if verapamil induces frequency-dependent <b>prolongation</b> <b>of</b> atrioventricular nodal conduction in 10 consecutive patients studied in the electrophysiology laborato-ry. We used a maintenance infusion of verapamil designed to produce plasma concentrations of verapamil in the "therapeutic " range and that did not alter heart rate or blood pressure significantly. Frequency-dependent <b>prolongation</b> <b>of</b> atrioventricular nodal conduction (AH interval) was demonstrat-ed in all 10 patients (p <. 001), and no change in HV conduction time with decreasing cycle length was noted in any patient while receiving verapamil. Two patterns of use-dependent response were seen. In four patients frequency-dependent <b>prolongation</b> <b>of</b> the A(AH) interval [IAH) = AHverapamil- AHcontrol at a given cycle length] was seen with each decrement in pacing cycle length. In six patients frequency-dependent <b>prolongation</b> <b>of</b> the A(AH) interval was not manifest until the fifth to eighth pacing cycle length tested. There was no association between the pattern observed and the initial heart rate or AH interval. After an abrupt change in pacing cycle length, the kinetics <b>of</b> A(AH) interval <b>prolongation</b> were rapid; equilibrium was achieved by five to eight pulses in all patients. There was no correlation between the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>prolongation</b> <b>of</b> the AH interval noted at a particular cycle length and the concentration of verapamil during the maintenance infusion. These results indicate that verapamil causes use-dependent <b>prolongation</b> <b>of</b> atrioventricular nodal conduction in man...|$|R
