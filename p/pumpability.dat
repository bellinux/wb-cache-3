5000|$|Repressuring is {{the method}} by which the {{pressure}} inside a crude oil well is increased so as to increase {{the output of the}} well. Pumping crude oil from a reservoir causes its pressure to drop, which further reduces <b>pumpability.</b> Returning the natural gas or other inert gases to the oil well increases the <b>pumpability</b> of the crude present inside the well by decreasing its viscosity and density. In one instance, slower rate of oil production and recycling of natural gas at 9.6 MPa enabled a net recovery of 70% of the oil originally present.|$|E

5000|$|Most large marine diesels run {{on heavy}} fuel oil (sometimes called [...] "bunker oil"), which is a thick, viscous and almost {{flameproof}} fuel which is very safe to store and cheap to buy in bulk {{as it is a}} waste product from the petroleum refining industry. The fuel must not only be pre-heated, but must be kept heated during handling and storage in order to maintain its <b>pumpability.</b> This is usually accomplished by steam tracing on fuel lines and steam coils in fuel oil tanks. The fuel is then preheated to over 100C before entering the engine in order to attain the proper viscosity for atomisation.|$|E
5000|$|Viscosity: Viscosity is {{a measure}} of the {{consistency}} of a fluid. The higher the viscosity, the higher the consistency of the fluid is (it is less fluid); the lower the viscosity, the lower the consistency of it is (more fluid). Highly-viscous filling products in the food processing industry are primarily found in the meat, bakery products and convenience food sectors. These highly-viscous substances are commonly referred to as being “pasty”. The fluidity is the basic requirement for the <b>pumpability</b> of a fluid. The viscosity can also be determined using suitable rheological measuring apparatus. In the food sector, the viscosity is primarily dependent on the fluid content of the filling product.|$|E
50|$|It is {{essential}} that large particles (> 150 μm for calcium carbonate and > 45 μm for quartz) should be eliminated from the rawmix, to facilitate chemical combination in the kiln. In the case of slurries, larger particles can be removed by hydrocyclones or sieving devices. These require {{a certain amount of}} energy, supplied by high pressure pumping. This process, and the moving and blending of the slurry, require careful control of the slurry viscosity. Clearly, a thinner slurry is easily obtained by adding more water, but at the expense of high energy consumption for its subsequent removal. In practice, the slurry is therefore made as thick as the plant equipment can handle. Cement rawmix slurries are Bingham plastics which can also exhibit thixotropic or rheopectic behaviour. The energy needed to pump slurry at a desired rate is controlled mainly by the slurry's yield stress, and this in turn varies more or less exponentially with the slurry solids/liquid ratio. In practice, deflocculants are often added in order to maintain <b>pumpability</b> at low moisture contents. Common deflocculants used (at typical dose rates of 0.005-0.03%) are sodium carbonate, sodium silicate, sodium polyphosphates and lignosulfonates. Under favourable circumstances, pumpable slurries with less than 25% water can be obtained.|$|E
5000|$|Gas {{reinjection}} is the reinjection {{of natural}} gas into an underground reservoir, typically one already containing both natural gas and crude oil, {{in order to increase}} the pressure within the reservoir and thus induce the flow of crude oil or else sequester gas that cannot be exported. This is {{not to be confused with}} gas lift, where gas is injected into the [...] annulus of the well rather than the reservoir. After the crude has been pumped out, the natural gas is once again recovered. Since many of the wells found around the world contain heavy crude, this process increases their production. The basic difference between light crude and heavy crude is its viscosity and <b>pumpability</b> - the lighter the crude the easier it is to pump. Recovery of hydrocarbons in a well is generally limited to 50% (heavy crudes) and 75-80% (light crudes). Recycling {{of natural gas}} or other inert gases causes the pressure to rise in the well, thus causing more gas molecules to dissolve in the oil lowering its viscosity and thereby increasing the well's output. Air is not suitable for repressuring wells because it tends to cause deterioration of the oil, thus carbon dioxide or natural gas is used to repressure the well. The term 'gas-reinjection' is also sometimes referred to as repressuring--the term being used only to imply that the pressure inside the well is being increased to aid recovery.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The current paper {{introduces}} {{a case study}} {{dealing with the problem}} of <b>pumpability</b> of the ready-mix concrete of grade of C 16 / 20 -X 0 v(H) - 24 -F 3 [1]. During solving a practical industrial problem we have worked out a modified composition of the related concrete material in order to improve the <b>pumpability.</b> After describing some possible theoretical and practical methods the authors give suggestion for a practical solution. The characteristic feature of the method consists in modifying the recipe of the given grade of concrete without altering the additive structure, and to assure the pulp saturation. The paper reports the results of standardised physical and mechanical tests, executed on the novel concrete material. Based on these results it has been proved, that besides solving the original practical problem of <b>pumpability,</b> the new concrete material possesses better application and technological performance, and is more economical to produce. Preliminaries and Objectives The domestic concrete industry often faces the problem that costumers do not indicate certain – occasionally very important – technical requirements, like e. g. the demand for <b>pumpability.</b> This shortcoming may lead to serious damages, furthermore may cause extra costs and loss of time.

40|$|During {{concrete}} pumping, a lubrication {{layer is}} formed at {{the interface between}} the concrete and the pipe. The <b>pumpability</b> highly depends {{on the characteristics of}} this layer. In this study, a method to enhance the <b>pumpability</b> by externally imposing an electromagnetic field on the pipe was suggested and experimentally verified. The electromagnetic field activates the free movement of the water molecules so that the layer is expected to become more slippery. Pumping tests with a 1000 m long pipeline were conducted with and without applying an electromagnetic field. When the electromagnetic field was imposed, the same discharge rate could be obtained with a 30 % reduction in the pump pressure, and a 15 % increase in the velocity under the same pump pressure was observed. The tests revealed that the imposition of an electromagnetic field was very effective in improving the <b>pumpability.</b> close 0...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{estimate}} the <b>pumpability</b> and shootability of wet-mix shotcrete (WMS) made with crushed aggregates and various admixtures such as silica fume, fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), metakaolin, and steel fiber based on rheological properties. The IBB rheometer was employed as an apparatus to measure the rheological properties of freshly mixed shotcrete such as flow resistance and torque viscosity. Results {{have shown that the}} use of silica fume and metakaolin led to satisfactory <b>pumpability,</b> whereas mixtures with fly ash and steel fiber failed to meet the pumping criteria at normal pump pressure. The build-up thickness, an indicator to represent shotcrete shootability, was predicted to vary between 68 and 218 [*]mm, demonstrating that the use of admixtures resulted in a wide spectrum of shootability. In particular, the use of metakaolin was found to substantially increase the predicted build-up thickness only with a small replacement. The findings of this study are expected to be used as an easy-to-use guideline for estimating <b>pumpability</b> and shootability of WMS when no compliance testing data is available...|$|E
40|$|There {{are some}} {{experimental}} {{studies on the}} <b>pumpability</b> of fresh concrete but few analytical ones besed on rhrology in comparison. On the other hand, various kinds of new concretes whose properties {{are very different from}} that of normal fresh concrete are being practocable. The authors have proposed an analytical method for simulating the flow behavior of fresh concrete besed on a viscoplastic finite element method because {{it is very important to}} establish analytical methods for the <b>pumpability</b> of fresh concrete on the rheological point view. In this way, a viscoplastic suspension element method - VSEM - is proposed as another method for analyzing the flow and deformation of fresh concrete, and some analytical results are shown...|$|E
40|$|The <b>pumpability</b> of concrete, or {{its ability}} to move through pipes and hoses by {{the help of a}} pump while {{maintaining}} its fresh and hardened properties, can be quantified as being better the lower the necessary pressure to obtain a given flow in a specific configuration and set-up (pump type, -capacity, pipes/hoses, –diameter/length etc). The practical pumping process including the principles of piston- and screw pumps show that {{for a wide range of}} concretes the flow in a given set-up is approximately proportional to pump-frequency whereas resulting pressure depends on concrete technological parameters (concrete composition, rheology). Based on review and some preliminary pumping trials in the NTNU concrete laboratory we propose concrete pressure gradient over the pipe length as a measure of <b>pumpability</b> for a given pump set-up. We then present some results on flow measurements in experiments on commercial premix products and open lab concretes and mortars. Measurements of rheological parameters in the BML-viscometer, concrete pressure in pipe, concrete flow and energy in an instrumented full-scale pump-set up with a screw pump indicate that plastic viscosity is the main rheological parameter affecting <b>pumpability.</b> Analysis of the degree of plug flow indicates a wide variety of flow profiles. A simplified 2 D FEM analysis with Navier Stokes equation using Papanastasious solution for Bingham fluid gives convergent flow with similar plug flow profiles as the analytical Buckingham Reiner equation. An analytical slip layer model was developed applying the Bingham model. It can be fitted to plug flow but more experiments are needed on what the boundary flow looks like. Continued research should study plug flow, slip layers and concrete rheology effects (admixtures, matrix volume and –properties) on <b>pumpability</b> including effects of pump frequency, increasing vs decreasing flow, hose characteristics (material, diameter, length, height etc). This could also be used in form filling experiments. A reliable numerical model must describe both flow through the pump and pipes/hoses as well as the form filling satisfactorily...|$|E
40|$|The {{rheological}} {{and material}} parameters determining the <b>pumpability</b> of fresh self-compacting mortar {{have been studied}} in full-scale (70 m Ø 50 mm rubber hose and screw pump with max capacity 7 m 3 /h). Concrete pressure gradient over the hose length (dp/dx) and flow rate were measured to quantify <b>pumpability.</b> The rheological properties of the pumped mortars were measured with a ConTec BML viscometer. Finally, the rheological properties of the slip layer that occurs in vicinity of {{the wall of the}} hose during pumping was studyed as matrix phase (paste and filler < 0. 125 mm) in a parallel plate rheometer. Five different concrete mixes were investigated showing that slump flow is not suitable for differentiating <b>pumpability.</b> Interpretation of rheological data was, moreover, complicated since the measured values of plastic viscosity and yield stress were altered simultaneously from mix to mix. The data imply that both yield stress and plastic viscosity govern <b>pumpability.</b> Increased plastic viscosity of mortar and paste was found to correlate with decreased mortar <b>pumpability.</b> No clear trends could be found for mortar yield stress. Increased paste yield stress was, however surprisingly, related to increased <b>pumpability.</b> The plastic viscosity seemed, however, to dominate yield stress when the two factors varied simultaneously within the given workability range. These parameters should, therefore, not be studied independently. Increased hysteresis area calculated from the paste measurements correlated well with reduced pump flow, also indicating a relation to the rheology of the slip layer. The predicted pressure losses were 5 - 7 times higher than the measured values. This indicates that {{one or more of the}} premises of the Buckingham-Reiner equation are erroneous in these tests, like inhomogeneous fluid and slippage. The existence of a plug is due to yield stress which was observed in both matrix and mortar. The combination of instrumented steady state pumping, concentric viscometre, parallel plate viscometer and visualized boundary flow rate were used to estimate slip layer thickness. The modified Buckingham Reiner equation resulted in slip zone thickness in the order of 0. 6 – 1 mm. The thicknesses were not sensitive to variations in matrix yield stress, whereas plastic viscosity had a major effect as shown in plots of slip zone viscosity vs slip zone thickness. At the slip zone thickness corresponding to the matrix rheology, the calculated specific viscosities (Pa•s/m) were all similar to the lowest values reported by Kaplan (2001). The average rates of shear in the thinnest slip zone were estimated to be as high as 1000 [s- 1]. This is much higher than those used in the parallel plate viscometer [100 s- 1] and future parallel plate viscometre test made in conjunction with studies of this kind should be carried out to 1000 [s- 1]. Based on a few flow profile calculations and comparison with visualized profiles it seems reasonable to assume that the rheological properties of the concrete are not constant, but vary over the cross section of the tube and possibly also along the tube due to factors such as tixotropic behaviour, possibly shear thickening, stiffening, wall effects and/or segregation under shear. Some investigations of effect of pumping on compressive strength were made by measuring strength on cubes made from concrete before and after pumping. These showed negligible effects of pumping on strength. Further research recommendations are given. © Copyright SINTEF Building and Infrastructure 201...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} after {{most of the}} {{concrete}} mixings are executed, a concrete pump is• generally used on the construction site; but, unfortunately, as blockages happen in the pipe-line, it becomes necessary to make the concrete more plastic than the required plasticity in the original construction.

The authors made sure that the model of the pumping system behaved like truck-mounted pumps used in construction sites, and then investigated several causes that influence the <b>pumpability</b> in this testing apparatus. It was inferred that, with the model pump, loss of pressure in the pipe, segregation of fresh concrete under high pressure and influence of ta-pered pipe could be obtained.

40|$|Air entraining agent (AEA) {{can bring}} a lot of microbubbles into fresh {{concrete}} for improving its fluidity; however, high fluidity has adverse effect on the shootability of wet-mix shotcrete. In order to solve the contradictory issue, the paper developed a new type of green switch air entraining agent (GSAE) that can improve both the <b>pumpability</b> and shootability. The single-admixture and combination tests containing foaming ability and surface tension were performed with Deer agitator and automatic tension meter. The new AEA was developed with two constituents A and B. A was prepared with Sapindus mukorossi(S- 1), dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride(1231), and polyacrylamide. B was prepared with lauryl sodium sulfate (K 12) and silicone oil.

Experimental investigation showed that the optimal mixing amount of GSAE was 0. 1 %– 0. 2 % relative to cement. All performance measured of wet-mix shotcrete with 0. 12 % GSAE met the first-grade product requirements of the China National Standard.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{possibility}} of utilizing mixed construction waste and ultrafine tailings (CW&UT) as a backfilling aggregate that can be placed underground in a mine, physicochemical evaluation, proportioning strength tests, and <b>pumpability</b> experiments were conducted. It was revealed that mixed CW&UT {{can be used as}} a backfilling aggregate due to the complementarities of their physicochemical properties. In addition, as the results of the proportioning strength tests show, the compressive strength of a cemented CW&UT backfilling specimen cured for 28 days, with a mass fraction of 72 - 74 %, a cement-sand ratio of 1 : 12, and a CW proportion of 30 %, is higher than 1. 0 MPa, which meets the safety requirements and economic consideration of backfilling technology in many underground metal mines, and can also be enhanced with an increase in the cement-sand ratio. The results of the <b>pumpability</b> experiments show that cemented backfilling slurry based on CW&UT can be transported to the stope underground with a common filling pump, with a 16. 6 MPa maximum pressure, with the condition that the time of emergency shut-down is less than approximately 20 min.

Various terms like flowability, mobility, workability and <b>pumpability</b> have been used to explain the rheology of concrete (Tattersall et al. 1983). However, it is generally agreed to define rheology in terms of yield stress and plastic viscosity (Banfill 2006).
