2500|$|The epacts {{are used}} to find the dates of the new moon in the {{following}} way: Write down a table of all 365 {{days of the year}} (the leap day is ignored). Then label all dates with a Roman numeral counting downwards, from [...] "*" [...] (0 or 30), [...] "xxix" [...] (29), down to [...] "i" [...] (1), starting from 1 January, and repeat this {{to the end of the}} year. However, in every second such period count only 29 days and label the date with xxv (25) also with xxiv (24). Treat the 13th <b>period</b> (<b>last</b> eleven days) as long, therefore, and assign the labels [...] "xxv" [...] and [...] "xxiv" [...] to sequential dates (26 and 27 December respectively). Finally, in addition, add the label [...] "25" [...] to the dates that have [...] "xxv" [...] in the 30-day periods; but in 29-day periods (which have [...] "xxiv" [...] together with [...] "xxv") add the label [...] "25" [...] to the date with [...] "xxvi". The distribution of the lengths of the months and the length of the epact cycles is such that each civil calendar month starts and ends with the same epact label, except for February and for the epact labels [...] "xxv" [...] and [...] "25" [...] in July and August. This table is called the calendarium. The ecclesiastical new moons for any year are those dates when the epact for the year is entered. If the epact for the year is for instance 27, then there is an ecclesiastical new moon on every date in that year that has the epact label [...] "xxvii" [...] (27).|$|E
