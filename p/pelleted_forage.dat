40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} it is to help {{quantifying}} the forage consumption in Chinchilla farms function of breeding system. The two breeding systems adopted worldwide by the breeding farms, are on wire netting floor and bedded cages. All data’s we found in literature about forage standards for this species, it’s too old, (1981, 1982, 1986), and the new data’s quoting the oldies, without making a laboriously experiment subject. In this order we consider opportune to bringing up them to date. In this way, at the wire netting floor system we pursue the roughage (grass-clover hay) and the complete mixed <b>pelleted</b> <b>forage</b> consumption, collecting the rests bellow the cages, separated them in parts, and calculate the difference. At the bedded system we weight the rests every day, ad the difference were considered the consumption. After drawing and processing data’s we obtained a bigger pellet consumption at the adult animals kept on wire net floor with 48. 66 % comparing to the bedded cages system. In a case of youths the situation is exactly inverse, the weaned animals kept in bedded cages had bigger pellet consumption with 28. 93 % compared to the wire net floor system...|$|E
40|$|Sixteen ruminally-cannulated steers {{consuming}} dormant tallgrass-prairie forage {{were randomly}} assigned to one of four treatments: 1) control, no supplement; 2) soybean meal (SBM) +sorghum grain; 3) alfalfa hay; or 4) dehydrated alfalfa <b>pellets.</b> <b>Forage</b> dry matter (DM) intake was at least doubled by all three supplemental protein treatments (P. 10) among treatments; however, fiber (NDF) digestibility was depressed in steers supplemented with SBM+sorghum grain or dehydrated alfalfa pellets, compared with controls. Results from this study reinforce the concept that supplemental protein improves forage intake and utilization. Additionally, alfalfa hay and dehydrated alfalfa pellets appear to be at least as effective as SBM+sorghum grain when fed on an equal protein and energy basis...|$|R

40|$|In {{stable and}} {{predictable}} environments, grazing herbivores can use spatial memory to increase foraging efficiency. As most natural systems {{are characterized by}} unpredictability {{in the distribution of}} resources, we explored the foraging efficiency of sheep, Ovis aries, in relation to variability in spatial distribution of resources, predicting that as the environment became more variable, spatial memory would be replaced by sampling behaviour. We manipulated resource distribution by using bowls of food pellets to create seven preferred resource sites within a grass pasture. The provisioning of the bowls with pellets and the mass of pellets therein were altered to create four treatments in which resources remained stable or varied within and between resource sites. Where bowl position was predictable, sheep showed increased foraging efficiency by reducing the time devoted to <b>pellet</b> <b>foraging</b> in relation to the total mass of pellets consumed and by visiting fewer empty bowls while searching within a site. Where bowl position became less predictable, sheep increased sampling within sites, visiting more empty bowls before leaving a site. However, in contrast with previous observations, sheep did not return preferentially to the highest-quality sites within the test plot. This study suggests that sheep could use spatial memory at small spatial scales to improve foraging efficiency where resource distribution is predictable. The ability to switch between foraging tactics may allow sheep to maintain foraging success under variable conditions...|$|R

40|$|The current forage {{handling}} {{equipment in the}} cellulosic ethanol industry is severely limited by the low bulk density of baled and ground biomass. Low bulk density contributes to flowability problems and lack of maximizing trailer capacities. Biomass pelleting process can improve the bulk density and flowability characteristics of forages. The objectives of this research were to evaluate: (1) the energy requirements of grinding sorghum stalks, corn stover, wheat straw, and big bluestem through two different screen size openings, (2) the energy requirements of <b>pelleting</b> <b>forages</b> from the two grind sizes, (3) the physical properties of pelleted biomass, and (4) {{the costs associated with}} biomass processing, transportation, and storage. The two mill screen size openings (3. 2 and 6. 5 mm) were found to have significantly different energy consumptions for grinding step from each other. All four forage types, except for big bluestem and corn stover, were also found to have significantly different energy consumptions for grinding. Production rate through the 6. 5 mm screen was almost three times higher than that of the 3. 2 mm screen (average of 181. 4 vs. 68 kg/h). Hammermill screen size opening (i. e., grind size) was found to have significant effects on energy consumption for pelleting process. The four forage types were also found to have significantly different energy consumptions from each other, except for big bluestem versus wheat straw (P= 0. 1192). Particle length for the 3. 2 mm grind ranged from 0. 15 to 0. 18 cm, while the 6. 5 -mm grind ranged from 0. 20 to 0. 31 cm. Pelleting increased bulk density from 99. 96 to 160. 02 kg/m³ for raw biomass grinds to 499. 30 to 701. 13 kg/m³ for pelleted biomass. Pellet durability ranged from 93 % to 98 %. A cost analysis indicated that it would take roughly $ 22 extra per metric ton for the transportation, pre-processing, and storage of pelleted cellulosic biomass than corn grain. This cost is still almost half that of the cost for baled biomass...|$|R
40|$|The diet of non-breeding White Storks was {{studied by}} pellet {{analysis}} and included mainly insects (99. 9 %, n= 28947) with a predominance of grasshoppers (Orthoptera, 76. 1 %), and beetles (Coleoptera, 26. 1 %). The bush crickets Decticus albifrons/verrucivorus {{were the most}} numerous prey (29. 9 % by items), occurring in almost all pellets (98 % occurrence in pellets, n= 147) and predominating in half of them (49. 7 %). The grasshopper associations in the <b>pellets</b> specify <b>foraging</b> mainly in mesophytic grasslands that usually replace abandoned fields and overgrown pastures with {{a low level of}} grazing. The xerophytic grass-shrubby habitats, not rare on stony terrains, were of less importance, providing around 20 % by prey. The typical aquatic inhabitants and the use of carrion around villages were exceptions in the study diet. The number of innutritious materials in the pellets rose when the White Storks hunted on nippy and agile grasshoppers and decreased when the main pray was slower beetles taken from the ground. The roosting of non-breeding White Storks disappeared when their preferred feeding habitats were ploughed up in the following years...|$|R

Low bulk densities contribute to flowability problems and lack of maximizing trailer capacities. By pelleting we can increase the bulk density and flowability characteristics of forages. The objectives of this research were to evaluate (1) the energy requirements of grinding sorghum stalks, corn stover, wheat straw and big bluestem through two different screen sizes, (2) the energy requirements of <b>pelleting</b> <b>forages</b> from the two grind sizes, and (3) the physical properties of our various end products. The two screen types {{were found to have}} significantly different energy consumptions from each other (P<. 0001). The majority of the four forage types were also found to have significantly different energy consumptions for grinding from each other (P<. 0001). The exception was big bluestem vs. corn (P=. 2329). All of the 1 / 8 ” vs. 1 / 8 ” and 1 / 8 ” vs. 3 / 8 ” grinds were significantly different from each other (Most P<. 0001 and all at least P<. 05). 3 / 8 ” sorghum was significant against all other 3 / 8 ” forage types. No other comparisons were significant for 3 / 8 ” vs. 3 / 8 ” (All 3 / 8 ” sorghum P<. 0001). Production rate through the 3 / 8 ” screen was almost 3 times that of the 1 / 8 ” screen (Average of 400 lb/hr vs. 150 lb/hr). The two screen types were found to have significantly different energy consumptions for pelleting from each other (P<. 0001). The four forage types were also found to have significantly different energy consumptions from each other (P<. 0001) while the big blue vs. wheat did not. (P=. 1192). Particle length for the 1 / 8 ” grind ranged from. 06 inches to. 07 inches, while the 3 / 8 ” grind ranged from. 08 inches to. 12 inches. Pelleting increased bulk density from 6. 24 lb/ft 3 to 9. 99 lb/ft 3 for biomass grinds to 31. 17 lb/ft 3 to 43. 77 lb/ft 3 for pelleted biomass. Pellet quality ranged from 93 % to 98 %. A cost analysis indicated that it would take roughly $ 20 extra per ton for the transportation, pre-processing and storage of pelleted cellulosic biomass than whole corn.

For the carnivorous fish, the concentrations of THg and MeHg ranged from 0. 03 to 0. 31 mu g/g and from 0. 02 to 0. 30 mu g/g on wet weight basis, respectively. The concentrations were lower for the herbivorous fish with both within the range of 0. 01 - 0. 03 mu g/g. Out of the three tested fish feeds, tuna viscera contained the highest level of mercury (0. 20 mu g/g THg and 0. 13 mu g/g MeHg), with pellet feed containing the lowest level (0. 05 mu g/g THg and 0. 01 mu g/g MeHg). The calculated trophic transfer factor of MeHg was the highest (12 - 64) for fish fed on pellet feeds, and was the lowest for fish fed on tuna viscera. A significant relationship was found between Hg concentrations in caged fish and in fish feeds, thus Hg was primarily accumulated from the diet. Furthermore, the stable isotope delta N- 15 was positively correlated with the Hg concentration in two caged sites, indicating that delta N- 15 may be a suitable tool for tracking mercury in caged fish. We conclude that fish farming may be a good way of reducing the human exposure to Hg because mercury levels can be carefully controlled in such farming systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Dairy {{producers}} in Costa Rica primarily utilize grazing systems for their production systems; however, they must supplement with high amounts of imported grain because pasture quality {{is low and}} can negatively impact milk yields or weight gain. In this research study, we used the industrial process to make <b>forage</b> <b>pellets</b> out of whole plant soybean (Glycine max. L. Mer var CIGRAS 06) at the R 6 stage {{in order to provide}} a high quality feed that is potentially more affordable than imported feeds. During this process, the soybean was dehydrated to 24. 01 % moisture content (MC) to create pellets. The pellets were evaluated for their nutritional value. These samples were taken in all phases of the process including a sample of the whole plant soybean. The soybeans were planted at a density of 773, 514 seeds per acre. The yield obtained was of 6. 04 DM tons/acre. This low yield occurred because of the low photoperiod and high rainfall during the time frame of September, October and November. The dehydrator was built from recycled materials. The capacity of the dehydrator was of 3. 49 lbs per hour of dry forage and with an evaporation of 9. 88 lbs H 2 O/hr. The energy required for the process was 0. 278 lbs (LPG) /lb of dry <b>forage.</b> <b>Pellet</b> process was performed with a pelletizer property of Tico Fruit. The total production obtained was 0. 414 tons of soybean pellets, with a 75. 99 % DM and a relative feed value (RVF) of level 3. The average for crude protein (CP) was 16. 66 %, acid detergent fiber (ADF) was 40. 20 %, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) was 55. 11 %, and fat was 3. 35 %. The pellets had a final size particle of 0. 256 in of diameter and 1 in average of length. Production costs for the soybean pellet were 0. 38 dollars per pound. The high costs were due to the dehydration of the forage because of the high content of water when the soybean was harvested in field at 81. 48 % MC (Figure 2). Overall, this primary investigation leads us {{to a better understanding of}} what steps are necessary to creating a pelletized feed that could be adapted for feeding in Costa Rica.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Juvenile Cherax {{destructor}} (commonly called theyabby) were cultured in earthen-based {{ponds and}} tanks for 70 – 105 d, and were fed <b>pellets</b> and/or a <b>forage</b> crop of the perennialwhiteclover, Trifolium repens. Three supplementary feedingstrategies were evaluated. Yabby growth on pellets consistently exceeded (by 67 – 159 %) that obtained on clover. Base-line yields for extensiveproduction systems are around 400 kg ha – 1. Thesupplementary addition of T. repens produced yields of 635 kg ha – 1 (in ponds) to 1086 kgha – 1 (in tanks). The sequential addition of cut-cloverto tanks stimulated growth to levels approaching those achieved on pellets. Yabbies stocked into ponds at 17 m – 2 and fed 33 %protein pellets for 100 d, {{resulted in a}} yield of 1117 kgha – 1. Pellet inputs {{at a rate of}} 129 – 249 g m – 2 (dry matter) and 38 – 83 g m – 2 (protein) over 70 – 100 d resulted in acceptable growth and feed utilisationindices. Clover inputs of 534 – 682 g m– 2 (asdry matter) or 84 – 177 g m – 2 (as protein) produced reasonable growth rates but poor feed utilisation indices. Aconsiderable quantity of the dry matter and protein content of clover waseitherinefficiently utilised or directed into other production pathways.
