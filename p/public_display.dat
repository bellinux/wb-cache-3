40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>displays</b> are {{becoming}} a common sight in the urban landscape and they are increasingly being equipped with interaction components such as touch screens. In addition, the Web and its set of enabling technologies are attractive for realizing applications for <b>public</b> <b>displays.</b> We argue that to develop multi-application <b>public</b> <b>displays,</b> then services generally need {{to be easy to}} develop, robust, and be easy to deploy and maintain. In this position paper we present a virtual machinebased Web application platform, for decentralized deployment of interactive services on heterogeneous <b>public</b> <b>displays,</b> which satisfies the aforementioned requirements. We also report on some usage experiences of utilizing the platform in a network of large <b>public</b> <b>displays,</b> which we have deployed in a mid-size city...|$|R

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>displays,</b> {{typically}} {{equipped with}} touchscreens, {{are used for}} interactions in public spaces, such as streets or fairs. Currently low-cost visual sensing technologies, such as Kinect-like devices and high quality cameras, allow to easily implement touchless interfaces. Nevertheless, the arising interactions {{have not yet been}} fully investigated for <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> in-the-wild (i. e. in appropriate social contexts where <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> are typically deployed). Different audiences, cultures and social settings strongly affect users and their interactions. Besides gestures for <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> must be guessable to be easy to use for a wide audience. Issues like these could be solved with user-centered design: gestures must be chosen by users in different social settings, and then selected to be resilient to cultural bias and provide a good level of guessability. Therefore the main challenge is to define touchless gestures in-the-wild by using novel UCD methods applied out of controlled environments, and evaluating their effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Our urban environments are {{increasingly}} being outfitted with various forms of digital media, such as electronic billboards, <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> and interactive lighting. While their deployment is commonly motivated by commercial and functional objectives, {{the impact on the}} urban fabric is often neglected. However, as <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> become situated in their environment and content becomes hyperlocal, they contribute to the place-making process and become a medium for local communication and information. In this article, we build upon an analysis of two recent case studies to propose four sets of design considerations for situated <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> in urban space. We argue that <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> should provide mechanisms to (1) warrant hyperlocal relevance of the messages that are communicated, (2) build a sense of trust from the surrounding community, (3) allow citizens to reflect on the meaning and functionality, and (4) elicit enriched experiences of the environment they are situated in. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Construction {{sites are}} a common part of a city landscape, e. g., website Urban Toronto reports on 650 + {{registered}} works {{for the city of}} Toronto, while New London Architecture reports on 195 in London. Up until now there has been little research looking into how <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> are used at these settings. This paper reports on an exploratory study that looked into understanding the use of <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> on construction sites. By analyzing types of displays and their purpose on 38 construction sites located on 2 continents and 4 cities, I have uncovered 10 different types of displays that serve to fulfill 9 identified objectives. Based on this I provide 5 general design implications for pervasive <b>public</b> <b>displays.</b> Overall, the contribution of this paper lies in describing the use of <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> in a new context and providing design implications for them.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} make <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> more {{appreciated}} in their environment we have to open them up {{to a wide range}} of content sources and make them fulfil usually conflicting requirements of different stake-holders. A typical digital signage system shows content that is mostly known in advance and provides content selection mechanisms only to display owners- persons who physically own <b>public</b> <b>displays.</b> This work addresses challenges in opening <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> to content and applica-tions from a wide range of content providers and providing tools and dy-namic mechanisms for control and selection of content while still keeping display owners in the overall control of their displays. ...|$|R

In this paper, we concisely present design, implementation and longitudinal living-lab analysis of a network of interactive large <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> in downtown city of Oulu, in northern Finland.
