5|$|Agar.io is a massively {{multiplayer}} online action game {{created by}} Matheus Valadares. Players control a cell in a map representing a petri dish. The {{goal is to}} gain as much mass as <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> eating agar and cells smaller than the player's cell, while avoiding larger ones which can eat the player's cell(s). The name comes from the substance agar, used to culture bacteria.|$|E

5|$|Allen {{launched}} the Allen Distinguished Investigators Awards (ADI) in 2010 to support scientists pursuing early-stage research projects who often have difficulty securing funding from traditional sources. The ADI grant program backs pioneering {{researchers in the}} areas of emerging life sciences technology to cellular decision-making and neural engineering with the intent that research made <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> these grants will advance each respective field.|$|E
5|$|Due to an {{increase}} of ridership, the MTA has tried to increase capacity wherever <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> adding more frequent service, specifically during the evening hours. However, this increase will not likely {{keep up with the}} growth of subway ridership. Some lines have capacity for additional trains during peak times, but there are too few subway cars for this additional service to be operated.|$|E
5|$|His {{political}} {{projects were}} put on hold, and Caragiale instead concentrated his energy on obtaining the French Légion d'honneur order, eventually becoming one of its Chevaliers in December 1929. The Romanian author himself noted that this had been made <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> the intercession of François Lebrun, the Bucharest correspondent of Le Matin newspaper, whom he considered a personal friend.|$|E

5|$|In 'Empire Mode,' {{the player}} can choose a ruler for their forces, {{along with two}} main generals. Three minor lieutenants can also be chosen for support. In battle, the capture of enemy {{officers}} is <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> lowering their morale and defeating them.

5|$|In February 1927 Ferens {{formally}} {{handed over}} the Ferens Institute of Otolaryngology to Prince Arthur, which he had made <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> a donation of £20,000.

5|$|In {{towns and}} central country districts during the 18th century, log walls were {{increasingly}} covered by weatherboards, a fashion made <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> sawmill technology. These buildings were better insulated and better protected against the harsh climate. But {{the main reason}} for the rapid adoption of this custom was the more fashionable appearance of boarded walls, which were more suitable than bare log walls as a background to details and ornaments borrowed from classical architecture.|$|E

5|$|Most ionic {{compounds}} {{are very}} brittle. Once {{they reach the}} limit of their strength, they cannot deform mealleably, because the strict alignment {{of positive and negative}} ions must be maintained. Instead the material undergoes fracture via cleavage. As the temperature is elevated (usually close to the melting point) a ductile–brittle transition occurs, and plastic flow becomes <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> the motion of dislocations.|$|E
5|$|Perl {{poetry is}} the {{practice}} of writing poems that can be compiled as legal Perl code, for example the piece known as Black Perl. Perl poetry is made <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> {{the large number of}} English words that are used in the Perl language. New poems are regularly submitted to the community at PerlMonks.|$|E
5|$|Preservation of most {{specimens}} {{was made}} <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> the fast sedimentation that quickly cut the organism off from seawater; {{it may also}} have been enhanced by the decay products of the rotting organism, which could have helped the overlying sediment to mineralise and harden. It has been suggested that a mucus trail produced by the organism may have assisted its preservation, but experiments suggest that mucus disintegrates too easily {{to play a role in}} binding sediment together.|$|E

5|$|Some of Van Rensselaer's {{success as}} a jewel {{merchant}} came about due to trade made <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> the Dutch East India Company.
