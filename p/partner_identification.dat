Consequently, multiple intimate <b>partner</b> violence <b>identification</b> or screening programs within health care settings have been developed; however, substantial variations in program content and interpretation of program effectiveness has resulted in conflicting practice guidelines. The purpose of our scoping review is to broadly identify and synthesize the available literature evaluating intimate <b>partner</b> violence <b>identification</b> programs within health care settings to identify key areas for potential evidence-based recommendations and to focus research priorities in the field. We conducted a search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and psycINFO. We used broad eligibility criteria to identify studies that evaluated intimate <b>partner</b> violence <b>identification</b> programs in health care settings. We completed all screening and data extraction independently and in duplicate. We used descriptive statistics to summarize all data. We identified 59 eligible studies evaluating intimate <b>partner</b> violence <b>identification</b> programs within health care settings. The most commonly reported outcome themes were IPV disclosure (69 %, n = 35), number of patients screened (39 %, n = 20), HCP opinions towards screening (37 %, n = 19), and patient opinions towards screening (29 %, n = 15). The majority of studies (36 studies (70. 6 %)) reported positive program evaluation results. The majority of studies reported positive program evaluation results.

How protein physico-chemical and geometrical properties determine who interact with whom remains far from fully understood. We show that characterizing how a protein behaves with many potential interactors {{in a complete}} cross-docking study leads to a sharp identification of its cellular/true/native partner(s). We define a sociability index, or S-index, reflecting whether a protein likes or not to pair with other proteins. Formally, we propose a suitable normalization function that accounts for protein sociability and we combine it with a simple interface-based (ranking) score to discriminate partners from non-interactors. We show that sociability {{is an important factor}} and that the normalization permits to reach a much higher discriminative power than shape complementarity docking scores. The social effect is also observed with more sophisticated docking algorithms. Docking conformations are evaluated using experimental binding sites. These latter approximate in the best possible way binding sites predictions, which have reached high accuracy in recent years. This makes our analysis helpful for a global understanding of <b>partner</b> <b>identification</b> and for suggesting discriminating strategies.

On the one hand, we evaluated {{the quality of the}} interaction signal and the contribution of docking information compared to evolutionary information showing that the combination of the two improves <b>partner</b> <b>identification.</b> On the other hand, since protein interactions usually occur in crowded environments with several competing partners, we realized a thorough analysis of the interactions of proteins with true partners but also with non-partners to evaluate whether proteins in the environment, competing with the true partner, affect its identification.

40|$|Introduction: Radical prostatectomy (RP) {{offers a}} good {{long-term}} cancer control for clinically localized prostate cancer. However, complications such as erectile dysfunction and substantial decreases {{quality of life}} of the afflicted men and their sexual <b>partners.</b> <b>Identification</b> of pre-, per-, and postoperative factors that correlate with poor postoperative erectile status must be considered an important step to improving penile rehabilitation. Aim: To describe postoperative erectile function after RP in a Danish cohort. Methods: The medical records of 1, 127 patients undergoing RP from March 2003 through September 2014 were reviewed retrospectively with a 12 -month follow-up after surgery. In all, 704 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included in the final analysis. Recovery was defined as self-reported erection sufficient for intercourse (ESI) with or without usage of erectile aids. Main Outcome Measures: Subjective reporting of erectile function and usage erectile aids 12 months after RP. Results: ESI with or without erectile aids was reported by 226 men (32. 1 %), among whom 109 (48. 2 %) required erectile aids. Erectile dysfunction (ED) was reported by 478 men (67. 9 %) and by 121 (25. 3 %) despite use of erectile aids. Of men with ED, 155 (22 %) stated not being interested in penile rehabilitation, 26 (3. 7 %) stated not having resumed their sex life 12 months after RP, and 241 (34. 2 %) had ED and were unsatisfied with the condition. We found that 134 of 445 men (30. 1 %) who underwent non–nerve-sparing RP had ESI 12 months after RP. Age older than 60. 5 years, a high body mass index, comorbidity, and a high American Society of Anesthesiologists score were negative predictors of erectile function 12 months after RP. Conclusion: Twelve months after RP, 32. 1 % of men had ESI; half these men required the use of erectile aids.

40|$|Governments {{in several}} European {{countries}} have developed policies that encourage companies to share ownership {{of renewable energy}} projects with local communities. Shared ownership presumes that company and community actors have common goals, can form effective partnerships and negotiate fair outcomes. But {{there is a lack}} of research on shared ownership, in particular, how it is constructed by different actors, and the role of trust in shaping practice. This study addressed this gap, drawing on qualitative data from in-depth interviews with 19 UK stakeholders from industry, community and advisory backgrounds. Thematic analysis revealed strong support for shared ownership in principle, but significant challenges in practice. Actors held different rationales and contrasting views on whether the policy should be discretionary or mandatory. A lack of trust was prevalent, with developers expressing scepticism regarding the capacities and representativeness of community actors; and community actors viewing developers as solely motivated by profit, instrumentally using communities to gain planning consent. We conclude that for shared ownership to become conventional practice, it will be necessary to provide mechanisms that facilitate <b>partner</b> <b>identification</b> at an early stage, which can help to build relations of trust between actors, within a more stable and supportive policy context...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the design, implementation, and evaluation of algorithms for communication <b>partner</b> <b>identification</b> in mobile agent-based distributed job workflow execution. We first describe a framework for distributed job workflow execution over the Grid: the Mobile Code Collaboration Framework (MCCF). Based on the study of agent communications during a job workflow execution on MCCF, we identify the unnecessary agent communications that degrade the system performance. Then, we design a novel subjob grouping algorithm for preprocessing the job workflow's static specification in MCCF. The obtained information is used in both static and dynamic algorithms to identify partners for agent communication. The mobile agent dynamic location and communication based on this approach is expected to reduce the agent communication overhead by removing unnecessary communication partners during the dynamic job workflow execution. The proof of the dynamic algorithm's correctness and effectiveness are elaborated. Finally, the algorithms are evaluated through a comparison study using simulated job workflows executed on a prototype implementation of the MCCF on a LAN environment and an emulated WAN setup. The results show the scalability and efficiency of the algorithms as well as the advantages of the dynamic algorithm over the static one. Department of Computin...|$|E

Methods: Recombinant baculoviruses expressing the HAdV- 41 SF protein and HAdV- 3 penton base were cloned and amplified in Sf 9 insect cells. Recombinant dodecahedra were expressed by coinfection of High Five (TM) cells with both baculoviruses, 72 h post-infection. Cell lysate was centrifuged on sucrose density gradient and the purified recombinant dodecahedra were recovered. Results: Analysis by negative staining electron microscopy demonstrated that chimeric dodecahedra made of the HAdV- 3 penton base and decorated with the HAdV- 41 SF were successfully generated. Next, recombinant dodecahedra were digested with pepsin and analyzed by Western blot. A 'site-specific' proteolysis of the HAdV- 41 SF was observed, while the HAdV- 3 penton base core was completely digested. Conclusion: These results show that, in vitro, the HAdV- 41 SF likely undergoes proteolysis in the gastrointestinal tract, its natural environment, which may facilitate the recognition of receptors in intestinal cells.
