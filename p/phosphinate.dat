Further data are given in the Arcadis Study carried out {{on behalf of the}} European Commission Health & Consumers DG, Contract number 17.020200/09/549040: “Identification and evaluation of data on flame retardants in consumer products. Final Report” of 26 April 2011, Chapter 5.23, p. 168. Aluminium diethyl <b>phosphinate</b> has also been investigated in projects of the US EPA Design for Environment (DfE) programme [...] and in the European FP7 research project Enfiro. With the exception of being persistent and thus not readily biodegradable, aluminium diethyl <b>phosphinate</b> has been shown to have a favourable environmental and health profile.|$|E
50|$|In {{the family}} of dialkyl phosphinic acid salts, {{aluminium}} diethyl <b>phosphinate</b> {{has been found to}} be an excellent flame retardant for use in engineering plastics such as polyamides, polyesters, thermosets and elastomers. It was developed by Hoechst, later by Clariant chemicals and Ticona.In 2004 and 2012, Clariant chemicals opened its first and second commercial production lines respectively in Huerth-Knapsack near Cologne.Aluminium diethyl <b>phosphinate</b> acts as a flame retardant in the condensed phase in contributing to charring of the polymer matrix and thus protecting the substrate against heat and oxygen attack. In parallel it acts in the gas phase by radical reactions removing from the combustion zone the high energy radicals H. and OH., which determine flame propagation and heat release.The <b>phosphinate</b> partly vaporises and partly decomposes to volatile diethyl phosphinic acid and an aluminium phosphate residue, which acts as a barrier for fuel and heat transport.Aluminium diethyl <b>phosphinate</b> is used as a halogen-free flame retardant for polyamides, polyesters, thermoset resins (e.g. epoxies) in electrical engineering and electronics (E&E) applications for switches, plugs, PC fans, and structural and housing components. Smartphones, washing machines, and airplane parts, among others, contain the product. Other applications include thermosetting resins and adhesives as well as cable sheaths and insulation made from thermoplastic elastomers. Aluminium diethyl <b>phosphinate</b> can give these plastics flame retardant properties that are otherwise only achievable with expensive high-performance plastics, which are less easy to work with. Aluminium diethyl <b>phosphinate</b> is often used in combination with other halogen-free flame retardant additives like melamine polyphosphate or melamine cyanurate.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates new {{intumescent}} formulations {{based on}} lignin and <b>phosphinates</b> {{to improve the}} flame retardant properties of Polyamide 11, while preserving the bio-based characteristics of this latter. Lignin {{has the advantage of}} being a bio-based compound and can be effectively used as carbon source for the design of intumescent systems in combination with other flame retardant additives. Metal <b>phosphinates</b> belong to a novel class of phosphorus flame retardants.

In this context, Polyamide 11 was melt blended with lignin and metal <b>phosphinates.</b> The possibility of melt spinning the prepared blends were assessed through melt flow index (MFI) tests; thermogravimetric (TG) analyses and cone calorimetry tests were exploited for investigating the thermal stability and the combustion behaviour of the obtained products, respectively. MFI results indicate that some formulations are suitable for melt spinning processes to generate flame retardant multifilament. Furthermore, the combination of lignin and <b>phosphinates</b> provides charring properties to polyamide 11.

50|$|The {{environmental}} behaviour of flame retardants {{has been studied}} since the 1990s.

The EU-funded collaborative research project ENFIRO (EU research project FP7: 226563, concluded in 2012) started out from the assumption that not enough environmental and health data were known of alternatives to the established brominated flame retardants. In order to make the evaluation fully comprehensive, it was decided to compare also material and fire performance as well as attempt a life cycle assessment of a reference product containing halogen free versus brominated flame retardants. About a dozen halogen free flame retardants were studied representing a large variety of applications, from engineering plastics, printed circuit boards, encapsulants to textile and intumescent coatings. A large group of the studied flame retardants were found to have a good environmental and health profile: ammonium polyphosphate (APP), Aluminium diethyl <b>phosphinate</b> (Alpi), aluminium hydroxide (ATH), magnesium hydroxide (MDH), melamine polyphosphate (MPP), dihydrooxaphosphaphenanthrene (DOPO), zinc stannate (ZS) and zinc hydroxstannate (ZHS).
