40|$|When a {{group member}} needs to {{retrieve}} the group state, it usually solicits it from {{one or more of}} the existing members and sets its local state accordingly. There are various criteria for state transfer, such as <b>pull</b> or push, <b>size</b> of the state, blocking or non-blocking etc. We will examine the different criteria for state transfer, and present the API and protocol used in JavaGroups [Ban, Ban 98] to transfer state. We focus on how the API and implementation provided can be customized to different application needs...|$|R
50|$|Heckling Fibre is <b>pulled</b> {{through various}} <b>sized</b> {{heckling}} combs. A Heckling comb is {{a bed of}} sharp, long-tapered, tempered, polished steel pins driven into wooden blocks at regular spacing. A good progression is from 4 pins per square inch, to 12, to 25 to 48 to 80. The first three will remove the straw, and the last two will split and polish the fibres. Some of the finer stuff that comes off in the last heckles can be carded like wool and spun. It will produce a coarser yarn than the fibres pulled through the heckles because it will still contain some straw.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Pressure {{analysis}} for a pultrusion die {{is very important}} for improving the finished product quality. The die inlet, which is usually tapered over a very short distance, is responsible for a pressure rise due to the back flow of resin. A mathematical model was developed for back flow/pressure analysis in the tapered die inlet. The model was based on the hydrodynamic theory of lubrication applied to the thin outer viscous annulus layer. The effects of various parameters such as the resin viscosity, preform <b>size,</b> <b>pull</b> speed, and profile of the inlet taper were examined. The present model may be utilized to obtain the best die inlet shape and the process conditions to achieve maximum possible pressure rise in the die inlet...|$|R
40|$|Previous work {{showed that}} in the pull-based {{development}} model integrators face challenges with regard to prioritizing work {{in the face of}} multiple concurrent pull requests. We identified the manual prioritization heuristics applied by integrators and extracted features from these heuristics. The features are used to train a machine learning model, which is capable of predicting a pull request’s importance. The importance is then used to create a prioritized order of the pull requests. Our main contribution is the design and initial implementation of a prototype service, called PRioritizer, which automatically prioritizes pull requests. The service works like a priority inbox for pull requests, recommending the top pull requests the project owner should focus on. It keeps the pull request list up-to-date when pull requests are merged or closed. In addition, the service provides functionality that GitHub is currently lacking. We implemented pairwise pull request conflict detection and several new filter and sorting options e. g. the <b>pull</b> request’s <b>size.</b> A preliminary user study showed that the PRioritizer service, although it is positively evaluated as a whole, needs to give users more insight into how the priority ranking is established to make it really useful.

50|$|Morrison was {{diagnosed}} and treated {{for breast cancer}} in 2008. A notable shift in her subject matter and palette was evident {{as a result of}} this life changing experience. Her solo exhibition, Larger Than Life in 2009 at Woodward Gallery, became a visual celebration of life. The dark, somber palette was replaced with jewel like colors, sparkling with high intensity. Morrison turned to imagery that, for her, became physical and psychological therapy. Sweet treats and comfort food on a massive scale predominated her paintings. In 2012 Morrison relived her childhood world of imagination with giant robots, enormous <b>pull</b> toys, life <b>size</b> dolls, and Fisher Price people for the Child's Play Exhibition at Woodward Gallery. The Gallery produced a limited edition, custom folding cube toy as the catalogue for Child's Play.|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing {{simulation}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} application areas of simulation technology and it is used to predict system performance or to compare different scenarios. It includes both facility design as well as supply chain modelling. Facility design involves aspects like equipment selection/layout, control strategies (push vs. <b>pull),</b> buffer <b>sizing,</b> etc. On the other hand, supply chain models are used to study the whole supply chain, involving distribution centres, transportation systems and multiple production facilities. A simulation model is a tool used for experimenting with manufacturing systems which are infeasible or non cost-effective. For this reason, it is important to determine whether the model is an accurate representation of the system we want to study. Thus, it must to be valid and credible: otherwise, the results may never be used in the decision-making process. This thesis discusses how simulation is used to improve the performance and design of manufacturing systems. It addresses the problem of designing and setting the right equipment as well as the right layout of the process line. In order to find good solutions they are commonly measured throughput, time in system, time spend in queues, queue sizes, timeless of deliveries, utilization of equipment and personnel, etc. Different scenarios are presented and different alternatives are considered depending on the resources available and the results we want to achieve.

50|$|The P227 also {{features}} the new Enhanced Ergonomics 'E2' wraparound grip, {{rather than the}} two-piece grips of the P220. The P227 has a magazine capacity of ten rounds {{and one in the}} chamber, unlike the seven- or eight-round capacity of the P220. SIG also offers a fourteen-round capacity magazine, which is included in various models. The P227 is a double-action/single-action-operated handgun, meaning that the first trigger pull is a ten-lbs double-action pull, but all the follow-up shots are a 4.4-lbs single-action <b>pull.</b> The full <b>size</b> model is 7.7 inches in length (with a 4.4 inch barrel) and 5.5 inches in height with 1.5 inches in width. It weighs 32 ounces (907 g) with the magazine, features an accessory rail and three-dot contrast sights or SIGLITE night sights. The frame is constructed from anodized aluminum alloy with a Nitron finish and a milled stainless steel slide.|$|R
5000|$|Dressing is {{the broad}} term {{referring}} to removing the fibers from the straw and cleaning {{it enough to}} be spun. Dressing consists of three steps: breaking, scutching and heckling. After breaking, some of the straw is scraped from the fibers in the scutching process, then the fiber is <b>pulled</b> through various <b>sized</b> heckling combs, or hackles. Different sized heckling combs are used, progressing from coarser combs {{with only a few}} prongs or nails per inch, to finer combs. Generally three heckling combs are used; however, many more can be used. The finer the final heckling comb, the finer the yarn spun from that flax can be. An example of a progression of five combs is first using a heckling comb with four nails per square inch, then one with 12 per inch, then 25, next 48, and finally 80 nails per inch. The first three remove the straw, and the last two split and polish the fibers.|$|R
40|$|As {{composites}} {{are being}} used as primary load bearing members, the increased understanding of damage tolerance of the material is becoming important. When load is applied to a structure containing a crack or damage, a small area ahead of the crack undergoes very high stress. These stresses cause further damage in this small zone. Initially this damage is at the microlevel: in isotropic materials the micro damage {{is in the form}} of slippage and microcracks at grain boundary; in composites the microdamage constitutes of matrix microcracks, matrix-fiber interface cracks and fiber <b>pull</b> out. The <b>size</b> of this damage zone varies depending on the material type and the damage tolerance i. e. energy absorbed by the damage zone is directly proportional to the damage zone. The damage zone can be mapped by various destructive and nondestructive methods. A destructive method is cutting the specimen and observation by SEM. Nondestructive methods are optical shadowgraph and photoelasticity 1 for transparent and transluscent materials and Holographic interferometery for opaque materials. 2 Poe et. al.

50|$|The most {{important}} aspect of any kite used to lift a camera is stability. Generally single lined kites are used as they allow very long line lengths and need less intervention from the flyer than steerable designs. Almost any stable kite design can be used to lift lightweight camera rigs (up to approx 500g/1 lb). As weight increases, specific designs are chosen for their additional flying characteristics, such as line pull, wind range, flying angle and ease of launch. Widely used designs are parafoil, rokkaku, delta (including variations such as delta conyne) and the new lighter-than-air helikite design. Of these, the parafoil is most popular as it generates a strong <b>pull</b> for its <b>size,</b> and can be easily stored in a small space due to its sparless construction. Sparred kites such as the rokkaku or delta tend to fly at a higher angle than parafoils, which is of benefit when the space between the launch site and photographic subject is limited. A higher flying angle permits the kite to lift more weight, as more of the generated force is acting vertically. Helikites allow reliable KAP in difficult conditions, thus opening up the use of KAP for professional photography.|$|R
40|$|Financial assets provide {{return and}} {{liquidity}} services to their holders. However, during severe …nancial crises many asset prices plummet, destroying their liquidity provision function {{at the worst}} possible time. In this paper we present a model of …re sales and market breakdowns, and of the …nancial ampli…cation mechanism that follows from them. The distinctive feature of our model is the central role played by endogenous complexity: As asset prices implode, more “banks”within the …nancial network become distressed, which increases each (non-distressed) bank’s likelihood of being hit by an indirect shock. As this happens, banks face an increasingly complex environment since {{they need to understand}} more and more interlinkages in making their …nancial decisions. This complexity brings about confusion and uncertainty, which makes relatively healthy banks, and hence potential asset buyers, reluctant to buy since they now fear becoming embroiled in a cascade they do not control or understand. The liquidity of the market quickly vanishes and a …nancial crisis ensues. The model exhibits a powerful “complexity-externality. ”As a potential asset buyer chooses to <b>pull</b> back, the <b>size</b> of the cascade grows, which increases the degree of complexity of the environment. This rise in perceived complexity induces other healthy banks to pull back, which exacerbates the …re sale and the cascade...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we test {{the effect of}} {{technological}} capabilities (accumulated knowledge andorganization/production routines) on the R&D intensity for a panel of European indus-tries. Our proxy for capabilities is {{the distance from the}} technological frontier. Estimationis carried out with System Generalized Methods of Moments and is robust to variousspecifications. Our identification strategy is limited to the average (reduced form) effect. We find a strong effect of capabilities on the amount invested in R&D, after controllingfor demand <b>pull,</b> technology push, <b>size,</b> and cash constraints. The latter ones are the mainvariables used in the literature on the determinants of innovative expenditure, of which R&Dis one of the components. The elasticity of the distance from the technological frontier is 10 %, of similar magnitude (but opposite sign) with regard to the effect of internal resources. When we allow for heterogeneous impact, clustering the industries according to theirtechnological level, we see that the effect of capabilities is robust, but concentrated inMedium and Low Tech sectors. Moreover, the effect is stronger in the upswings of thebusiness cycle and is concentrated in peripheral countries. These latter stylized facts maysuggest that the divergence induced by lack of capabilities is somehow nonlinear andincreases when a critical mass is missing. JRC. J. 2 -Knowledge for Growt...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether automatic approach action tendencies for alcohol-related stimuli {{were associated with}} variation in the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM 1), previously related to rewarding effects of alcohol and craving. An adapted approach avoidance task was used, in which participants pulled or pushed a joystick {{in reaction to the}} format of a picture shown on the computer screen (e. g. pull landscape pictures and push portrait pictures). Picture size on the screen changed upon joystick movement, so that upon a <b>pull</b> movement picture <b>size</b> increased (creating a sense of approach) and upon a push movement picture size decreased (avoidance). Participants reacted to four categories of pictures: alcohol-related, other appetitive, general positive and general negative. The sample consisted of 84 heavy drinking young men without a g-allele in the A 118 G (or A 355 G) single nucleotide polymorphism of the OPRM 1 gene and 24 heavy drinking young men with at least one g-allele. Heavy drinking carriers of a g-allele showed relatively strong automatic approach tendencies for alcohol (approach bias). Unexpectedly, they also showed an approach bias for other appetitive stimuli. No approach bias was found for general positive or negative stimuli. These results suggest that automatic approach tendencies in response to appetitive stimuli could {{play a role in the}} etiology of addictive behaviors and related disorders. Further research is needed to investigate the specificity of this approach bias and possible gender differences...|$|R
5000|$|There {{have been}} several {{renditions}} of electronic pull tabs since 1990. The latest rendition was that authorized in Minnesota in the 2012 legislative session. These devices are available for use by state licensed charitable organizations. This version of an electronic pull tab uses a hand-held device, similar to a tablet computer, with a touch screen interface. All such devices are subject to control and monitoring from a central computer. Each device must have access {{to one or more}} finite sets of chances not to exceed a maximum number per set or [...] "deal" [...] as they are called in <b>pull</b> tab lingo. <b>Sizes</b> of the sets are under jurisdictional control and vary between maximums of 7,500 to 25,000. Among the chances are a predetermined quantity of winning and losing chances. Furthermore, the legislature stated that pull tab devices have [...] "no spinning reels or other representations that mimic a video slot machine." [...] The Minnesota statute states an electronic pull-tab game means a pull-tab game containing [...] "(a) facsimiles of pull-tab tickets that are played on an electronic pull-tab device." [...] One value of such systems is that they not only are much more secure than paper based systems, but afford an opportunity to present games that fall within pull-tab definitions, yet have an enhanced presentation and are more suited to the desires of an electronically oriented public. Innovative manufacturers of such gaming systems expand the entertainment value of the gaming experience through the introduction of new game presentation styles.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{innovation}} policy, its concerns and rationality; the thesis seeks {{to explore the}} concerns of innovation policy: what governments want to achieve, what means they apply, and how innovation policies can come in conflict with other government goals and objectives, and it questions the rationality of pursuing these policies. More specifically, this thesis asks: What are the concerns of innovation policy? Should governments pass innovation policies? To answer the two questions, the thesis {{is divided into three}} parts. The first part reviews some theoretical issues, the second part explores five case studies, and the last part discusses the thesis s two questions in light of conclusions drawn from two previous parts. The first part explores relevant innovation-theory from three different schools of thought neoclassical economics, evolutionary economics, and the systems of innovation -approach. Based on these theories, a model is created, that will be used to analyse the case studies in part II. The model features four main factors: gain, pressure, pull, and push. Respectively, gain designates factors such as intellectual property rights; pressure, rivalry and cooperation between competitors; <b>pull,</b> the <b>size</b> and structure of demand; and push, knowledge bases and their location, augmentation, and means of access. These factors influence the decision-making and the ability of firms to introduce innovations. By altering one or several of these factors, governments can affect the rate and direction of innovation. Most of part I will be used to develop this model theoretically, exploring how and why each of the four factors affect the firms incentives and ability to innovate. In part II, the thesis will analyse five different case studies: the pharmaceutical industry, the biotech industry, electronics in Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea, hydrogen-powered vehicles, and the Microsoft antitrust trial. These cases will be analysed {{on the basis of the}} model introduced in part I, dividing the factors that influence an industries progressiveness into four parts. The purpose of this analysis is to explore the types of means that governments used to influence the various industries, to see what motivated the governments to intervene, and, finally, to see whether or not these policies where successful given the goals the governments had in mind. The last part of this thesis will be used, first, to summarize the most important concerns of innovation policy, and, then, to discuss the rationality of innovation policymaking. First in the summary the different types of innovation policy goals will be discussed, then, the different types of policy means, and, last, possible conflicts between innovation policy and other government goals. Second, the last part will discuss the rationality of innovation policymaking, looking at the limitations governments face in this regard. It will also see if any of the conclusions reached in the thesis have some kind of general validity. And, finally, it will discuss what the three different theoretical approaches have to say about innovation policy, and how this corresponds to the conclusions reach in this thesis...|$|R
500|$|In 405 BC, the Athenian navy was {{defeated}} and {{destroyed by the}} Peloponnesian fleet under Lysander at the Battle of Aegospotami in the Hellespont. Without sufficient funds to build another fleet, the Athenians could only wait as Lysander sailed westward across the Aegean towards their city. Blockaded by land and sea, with their food supplies running low, the Athenians sent ambassadors to the Spartan king Agis, whose army was camped outside their walls, offering to join the Spartan alliance if {{they were allowed to}} keep their walls and port; Agis, claiming that he had no power to negotiate, sent the ambassadors on to Sparta, but there they were told that, if they really wanted peace, they should bring the Spartans better proposals. The Athenians were initially intransigent, {{going so far as to}} imprison a man who suggested that a stretch of the long walls be torn down as the Spartans had insisted, but the reality of their situation soon compelled them to consider compromises. In this situation, Theramenes, in a speech to the assembly, requested that he be sent as an ambassador to Lysander (who was at this time besieging Samos) to determine the Spartans' intentions towards Athens; he also stated that he had discovered something that might improve the Athenians' situation, although he declined to share it with the citizenry. His request was granted, and Theramenes sailed to Samos to meet with Lysander; from there, he was sent to Sparta, perhaps stopping at Athens on the way. At Sparta, with representatives of all of Sparta's allies present, Theramenes and his colleagues negotiated the terms of the peace that ended the Peloponnesian War; the long walls and the walls of Piraeus were <b>pulled</b> down, the <b>size</b> of the Athenian fleet was sharply limited, and Athenian foreign policy was subordinated to that of Sparta; the treaty also stipulated that the Athenians were to use [...] "the constitution of their ancestors". Theramenes returned to Athens and presented the results of the negotiations to the assembly; although some still favored holding out, the majority voted to accept the terms; the Peloponnesian War, after 28 years, was at an end.|$|R
40|$|The occurrence, and causes, of pasture pulling under {{dairy farming}} on Orthic Pumice Soils (Typic Udivitrands) {{in the central}} North Island of New Zealand was investigated. Pasture pulling occurs on Pumice Soils, where dairy cows pull clumps of pasture from the soil, thus {{diminishing}} pasture production. The overall objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the occurrence, and establish the causes, of pasture pulling under dairy farming on Orthic Pumice Soil in the Central North Island, New Zealand. Fifteen paddocks containing pasture of differing ages were investigated at Pouakani dairy farm near Mangakino. Soil profile descriptions were undertaken, and samples were taken seasonally to monitor root depth and density, soil macrofauna, soil dry bulk density, and penetration resistance. Pasture pulling was monitored every 3 weeks by recording the number and <b>size</b> of <b>pulls</b> in a 4 m² quadrant at five points equally spaced along a transect in 15 paddocks. Pasture pulling was recorded in all paddocks and occurred throughout the year, but was most common during the late summer and autumn. Up to 80 % of the root biomass was in the 0 - 5 cm depth. The 5 - 10 cm depth generally showed increased compaction with higher soil dry bulk density and penetration resistance then the surface soil. Pastures in isolated clumps were more commonly pulled than more evenly spread pastures. There was an interaction between pasture age and <b>size</b> of <b>pulls,</b> with more medium and large <b>sized</b> <b>pulls</b> in the younger (1 - 3 year old) pastures. Although anecdotal evidence reports worse pulling in younger pastures, we did not find strong evidence for that assertion. Pasture pulling in 2014 at Pouakani dairy farm was not more obviously impacted by insects. Grass population numbers were uniformly low, and black beetle was rarely seen. Perennial ryegrass was dominant in all paddocks. The paddocks with older, more established pastures contained a higher proportion of other grass species and weeds. Only grass was pulled, other species such as clover, chicory and weeds were not pulled by grazing stock. A pasture pulling index, created to account for the size distribution of the pulls, was more effective at illustrating the seasonal trends associated with pasture pulling than the mean total pulls per quadrat. Overall, the pasture pulling was not severe at Pouakani Dairy farms in 2014. This study has not discovered one sole cause of pasture pulling at Pouakani dairy farms, but has identified a number of soil characteristics that may be contributing, including; limited rooting depth, low root density in the 5 - 10 cm depth, increased compaction with depth, less cohesive soil when it has low moisture, and the incidence of pasture growing in clumps...|$|R
