5|$|Occasionally, the Belgian team {{directly}} supported charity. Between 1914 and 1941 {{they played}} at minimum five unofficial games {{of which the}} returns were for charitable purposes: two against France, and three against the Netherlands. In mid-1986, when the Belgian delegation reached the Mexico World Cup semi-finals, the squad started a project titled Casa Hogar, an idea of delegation leader Michel D'Hooghe. Casa Hogar is a home for street children in the Mexican industrial city of Toluca, to which the footballers donated part of their tournament bonuses. In August 2013, the national team supported four social projects through the charity fund Football+ Foundation, by playing an A-match with a <b>plus</b> <b>sign</b> {{on the shoulders of}} their jerseys and auctioning the shirts.|$|E

25|$|The {{minus sign}} arises {{because of the}} sense the current i2 has been defined in the diagram. With both {{currents}} defined going into the dots the sign of M will be positive (the equation would read with a <b>plus</b> <b>sign</b> instead).|$|E
25|$|With the <b>plus</b> <b>sign,</b> the {{derivative}} {{is everywhere}} positive, so {{that for a}} background object, the blur disk size increases with focal length. With the minus sign, the derivative is everywhere negative, so that for a foreground object, the blur disk size decreases with focal length.|$|E
50|$|Thus, the {{probability}} of observing 3 or fewer <b>plus</b> <b>signs</b> or 7 or more <b>plus</b> <b>signs</b> in the survival data, if the median survival is 200 weeks, is 0.3438. The expected number of <b>plus</b> <b>signs</b> is 5 if the null hypothesis is true. Observing 3 or fewer, or 7 or more pluses is {{not significantly different from}} 5. The null hypothesis is not rejected. Because of the extremely small sample size, this sample has low power to detect a difference.|$|R

25|$|The en dash is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} substitute for the minus sign, when the minus sign character is not available, since the en dash is usually the same width as a <b>plus</b> <b>sign.</b> For example, the original 8-bit Macintosh character set had an en dash, useful for the minus sign, years before Unicode with a dedicated minus sign was available. The hyphen-minus is usually too narrow to make a typographically acceptable minus sign. However, the en dash cannot be used for a minus sign in programming languages because the syntax usually requires a hyphen-minus.|$|E
