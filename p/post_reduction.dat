Working with our colleagues at the Max Planck in Garching Germany (MPE), we fixed bugs and provided enhancements. The last major effort in this area was the port from VMS/VAX to VMS/ALPHA architecture. In 1998, a timing bug was found in the HRI standard processing system which degraded the positional accuracy because events accessed incorrect aspect solutions.

40|$|Introduction: The {{introduction}} {{provides a}} survey of the natural product and pharmaceutical targets accessible from dihydropyridines and dihydropyridones as well as an overview of previous work carried out towards the synthesis of these valuable intermediates. The mechanism, scope and limitations of the various approaches are covered, along with the goals of this project. Results and Discussion: A Regioselective Route to Dihydropyridones. The regioselective addition of nucleophiles to a range of disubstituted pyridinium salts has been achieved, with selectivity determined by hard/soft factors. Certain nucleophiles can be added with complete regioselectivity to either C- 2 or C- 6 of these salts, depending on the conditions employed. Addition at C- 2 allows the generation of a quaternary centre in high yield. The conditions discovered can be applied to pyridinium salts with different substitution patterns and an effective procedure has been developed for the removal of the nitrogen protecting group <b>post</b> <b>reduction.</b> The Preparation of Enantiopure Dihydropyridones. After unsuccessful attempts to find a reagent-controlled asymmetric synthesis of dihydropyridones, a highly diastereoselective and non-chiral auxiliary based substrate-controlled procedure has been developed. By prompting an intramolecular hydride migration from a secondary silyl ether onto the pyridinium core, the corresponding dihydropyridones are available in high yield, with the diastereoselectivity being controlled by the minimization of 1, 3 -allylic strain between the N-allyl group and the hydride-bearing side chain. Thus, an enantiopure pyridyl alcohol may be converted to the corresponding dihydropyridone without loss of enantiomeric purity. Furthermore, the dihydropyridones can be easily converted to complex bicyclic systems via a ring closing metathesis reaction. Experimental: Full experimental procedures and spectroscopic characterization of compounds are provided. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground and Purpose: Anterior {{shoulder}} dislocation is {{the most}} common major joint dislocation. In most cases, this dislocation is being relocated in emergency departments. Routinely, pre and <b>post</b> <b>reduction</b> radiographs are performed. This study was done to determine the necessity of radiographs in the emergency department for management of patients with suspected anterior shoulder dislocation. Materials and Methods: In this case series study, 116 patients suspected of anterior shoulder dislocation were referred to Hazrat Rasoul Akram and Haftome Tir Hospitals emergency departments in Tehran, and were investigated for a one year period. The emergency physicians evaluated and documented the possibility of dislocation or relocation, before obtaining radiographs. Outcome measures were the assessment of joint positions on the x-rays by an orthopedic surgeon. Results: 84 cases (72 %) were male and 32 cases (28 %) were female. Mean age of the patients was 31. 5 ± 8. 5 yrs. Thirty (30) patients had recurrent dislocations without traumatic mechanism (group 1) and eighty six (86) patients had no prior dislocation or a blunt mechanism of injury (group 2). The accuracy of the emergency physician’s assessment in dislocations was 100 % in group 1 and 98 % in group 2. False assessments occurred only in patients with fractures. There is no significant difference between emergency physicians and orthopedic surgeons in the assessment of dislocations and relocations, when the emergency physicians did accuralty diagnose them. Conclusion: Our study showed that the physicians are highly accurate in clinical determination of anterior shoulder dislocation and relocation. Pre-reduction films should be obtained when the mechanism of injury is trauma. Post-reduction films should be obtained in fracture-dislocations or when the physicians are uncertain of correct relocation...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Gastroschisis is {{the most}} common type of {{abdominal}} wall defect at birth. Various modalities of treatment have been proposed ranging from primary closure to the staged closure using prosthetic materials under general anesthesia. One of the modalities is manual ward reduction with primary repair of gastroschisis without anesthesia. We are reporting our 8 years of experience with manual ward reduction of gastroschisis with primary repair without anesthesia. Materials and methods: It is a retrospective analysis of all patients of gastroschisis who presented in our institution from January 2008 to June 2016. The data were analyzed for antenatal diagnosis, sex, day of presentation, weight of baby, associated anomalies, management by manual reduction without anesthesia and <b>post</b> <b>reduction</b> morbidity and mortality. Results: Out of a total of 68 patients, 28 were females and 40 were males. Fifty-five cases (80. 8 %) were antenatally diagnosed. Fifty-nine patients (86. 7 %) presented within 24 hours of birth while the rest had delayed presentation. Preterms (< 37 weeks) were 18 (26. 4 %). Cases of simple gastroschisis were 22 while those complicated were 46. The average birth weight was 1. 88 kg with the lowest weight of 1 kg who was a 27 -week preterm. In 60 patients (88. 2 %), bedside manual reduction without anesthesia and primary closure was possible while in 8 patients it could not be done owing to delayed presentation and complications. The mortality in these patients was 40 %. Conclusion: Manual reduction and primary closure of gastroschisis without anesthesia is a safe procedure. It requires no ventilator support and can be managed with antibiotics, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the post-reduction period. </p...|$|E

40|$|Intervertebral disc {{degeneration}} is {{a highly}} prevalent disorder with connections to low back pain. Among the early changes in degeneration is a reduction in glycosaminoglycan content in the nucleus pulposus of the disc. How this biochemical change alters disc health and function is not well defined, though such knowledge is needed to develop therapeutics to halt or reverse degeneration. The overall objective of this work was to model reduced nucleus glycosaminoglycan, as in early degeneration, in a rat lumbar disc {{to better understand the}} impact of this change on disc structure, mechanics, and biochemistry and on the progression of disc degeneration. ^ To determine the impact of reduced nucleus glycosaminoglycan on disc mechanics, an in vitro model of this biochemical change was created. Nucleus glycosaminoglycan levels correlated with disc mechanics with loss leading to a state of hypermobility. Dynamic viscoelastic testing demonstrated a similar relationship at low compressive loads across a spectrum of frequencies and showed an increase in phase angle with glycosaminoglycan loss. Thus, reduced glycosaminoglycan can directly alter disc mechanics and may contribute to degeneration progression through mechanical means. ^ Reduced glycosaminoglycan was modeled in a rat lumbar disc in an in vivo environment with temporal changes in disc properties evaluated up to 24 weeks <b>post</b> <b>reduction.</b> Initial changes in mechanics, biochemistry, and height consistent with early human degeneration were noted; however, a response more akin to regeneration than degeneration was observed as properties recovered towards control levels by 24 weeks. No association between the altered nucleus biochemistry and degeneration-like changes in cellularity or disc morphology were observed. Analysis of aggrecan fragmentation revealed an apparent decrease in catabolism in this model, which may be responsible in part for the recovery of disc properties. ^ In summary, in vitro and in vivo models of reduced nucleus pulposus glycosaminoglycan were established and utilized to better understand the role of this change in early degeneration. It is plausible that progression occurs through mechanical means, though damage progression was not observed in vivo. Instead, the potential for anti-catabolic mediated disc recovery was demonstrated, which may prove a viable option for future therapeutic strategies. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the search}} of better {{catalysts}} for fuel cells, synthesis of several intermetallic compounds and alloys as nanoparticles has been investigated. In order to obtain these materials as catalysts for fuel cells, chemical co-reduction of precursors {{in the absence of}} surfactants with suitable reducing agents has been chosen as the method of synthesis. This work was done in collaboration with combinatorial groups and electrochemists for identifying potential catalysts and electrochemically evaluating them. Starting with PtPb, the scope of this method has been extended to obtain Pt intermetallic compounds and alloys with metals across the periodic table with sodium naphthalide as the reducing agent. The sodium napthalide method has been compared {{side by side with the}} sodium borohydride method for metals which can be reduced by both. Other reducing agents have also been explored. PtPb synthesis using sodium naphthalide has been investigated in detail as a case study. Factors affecting room temperature crystallization of PtPb and contributing to low activity observed previously have been identified and addressed by changing the Pt precursor and <b>post</b> <b>reduction</b> work-up. Extending to Pt-Ti, additional factors, which need to be considered for highly reactive metals have been identified. Each of the parameters involved (metal precursor, reducing agent, reducing agent and precursor concentrations, reaction solvent, stirring time, reaction temperature, post reaction washed and annealing) have been analyzed in depth for co-reduction of Pb, Ti and the elements lying in between in reactivity. The observations and inferences in each case have been discussed. Alloy and intermetallic phases of Pt with Ni, Mn, Cr, V, Cd and Hg have been synthesized as nanoparticles. Powder X-ray diffraction, SEM and TEM (scanning and transmission electron microscopy respectively) imaging, surface area measurements (using BET isotherm) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) have been performed on all phases mentioned above. In some cases, IR, TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) and MS (mass spectroscopy) studies have also done on these phases in-order to identify contaminants. Several of these phases have shown significant activity for oxidation of formic acid. The electrochemical evaluations have been discussed. Challenges encountered in obtaining these materials clean with the sodium napthalide method have been discussed and are being addressed with other reducing agents like nBuLi. Lastly, in collaboration with the Adzic group in the Brookhaven National Laboratories, activity of PtPb for the oxygen reduction reaction in both nascent and modified form (with monolayer of Pt deposited by underpotential deposition) has been studied. Pd alloys and intermetallic compounds with Pb and Fe have also been synthesized, characterized and similarly evaluated.

40|$|Gold {{catalysts}} {{have been}} found to be efficient for many oxidation reactions. The performance of these catalysts depends strongly on the particle size of the Au nanoparticles. However, other factors also have a strong influence on the catalytic activity such as the preparation method and choice of support. The effect of support and the preparation methods has been investigated with regard to the selectivity and the activity of Au catalysts. The disproportionation of benzyl alcohol has been identified as a source of toluene formation in the solvent free oxidation of benzyl alcohol using supported gold palladium catalysts. The disproportionation reaction of benzyl alcohol oxidation has been performed in a conventional glass stirred reactor. Oxidation and disproportionation reactions respond slightly differently to the changes in reaction parameters, such as oxygen concentration and pressure. When MgO supported gold-palladium catalysts were used for this reaction, the toluene selectivity reduced substantially at the cost of conversion. The synthesis of bimetallic nanoalloys is of great practical importance as they exhibit size-dependent functional properties, which can be exploited in fields such as catalysis. Conventional chemical impregnation routes for generating supported bimetallic nanoparticles are facile, but often generate materials having broad particle size distributions, which typically exhibit core–shell morphologies and significant compositional variations from particle-to-particle. More complex sol-immobilisation synthesis techniques offer much better control over particle size distribution, but retain stabilising ligands on the surface, which can be deleterious for catalysis. Here, a convenient excess anion modification and <b>post</b> <b>reduction</b> step prior to the impregnation method has been used, which permits the reproducible preparation of supported bimetallic AuPd nanoparticles with a tight particle size distribution comparable to that found for sol-immobilisation materials, but without the complication of ligands adsorbed on the particle surface. These advantageous features of the modified impregnation materials resulting in higher activity and stability compared to the catalysts prepared using both conventional impregnation and sol-immobilisation methods. Detailed STEM combined with EDX analyses of individual particles have revealed that an increase in anion concentration increases the gold content of individual particles in the resultant catalyst, thus providing a method for controlling/tuning the composition of the nanoalloy particles. The improved activity and stability characteristics of these new catalysts are demonstrated using: (i) the solvent-free aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol and (ii) the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide as case studies. The study has examined using this modified impregnation catalyst in different Au:Pd ratios for the solvent-free aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. These modified impregnation catalysts {{have been found}} to be exceptionally active, mainly with a Aurich composition, when compared to reduced conventional impregnation catalysts. Moreover, these modified impregnation catalysts {{have been found to}} be exceptionally active and stable when evaluated for crotyl alcohol in mild conditions when compared to sol-immobilisation methods. This new preparation protocol could be beneficial for both the academic research community and the industrial community, with a very convenient and reproducible methodology for preparing supported Au-Pd nanoalloy catalysts with high activity and stability, without using any ligands or stabilisers, while not compromising their catalytic activity...|$|E
