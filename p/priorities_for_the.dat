5|$|Over {{the next}} four years, neither Henry nor the barons were able to restore {{stability}} in England, and power swung {{back and forth between}} the different factions. One of the <b>priorities</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> new regime was to settle the long-running dispute with France and, at the end of 1259, Henry and Eleanor left for Paris to negotiate the final details of a peace treaty with King Louis, escorted by Simon de Montfort and much of the baronial government. Under the treaty, Henry gave up any claim to his family's lands in the north of France, but was confirmed as the legitimate ruler of Gascony and various neighbouring territories in the south, giving homage and recognising Louis as his feudal lord for these possessions.|$|E
40|$|In {{terms of}} administration, Malang {{is divided into}} two regions, Malang City andMalang Regency. Although the regions are different, {{economically}} two regionscan not separated because almost all economic activities are concentrated atMalang City. This has impacts on the economic gap between Malang City andMalang Regency. With respect to gap, the research was conducted to analyze thegrowth center of Regional Development Unit (RDU) of the Malang City, based ontwo development directions: identifying sectoral economic potentials and thatfor regional sowol potentials. In terms of regional aspects, the description of development centers in each RDUare: (1) Ngantang Sub-district is a <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> development center of RDU I;(2) Singosari Sub-district is a <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> development center of northernRDU II; (3) Pakisaji Sub-district is a <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> development center ofsouthern RDU II; (4) Poncokusumo Sub-district is a <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> developmentcenter of RDU IV; (5) Kepanjen Sub-district is a <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> developmentcenter of RDU V; (6) Pagelaran Sub-district is a <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> developmentcenter of RDU VII; and (7) Turen Sub-district is a <b>priority</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> developmentcenter of RDU VIII. Since the results has policy impacts, the government of the Malang Regencyshould decide regional development policies referring to the regionaldevelopment concept based on the economic and regional potentials so that itcan give priorities to potential districts to be acted as development centers. Byimplementing the policy, it is expected that economic activities will not beconcentrated on one development point, the Malang City as the only developmentpoint...|$|R

5|$|The Great Depression {{threatened}} the already tentative nature of Georgia Tech's funding. In {{a speech on}} April 27, 1930, Brittain proposed that the university system be reorganized under a central body, rather than having each university under its own board. As a result, the Georgia General Assembly and Governor Richard Russell, Jr. passed an act in 1931 that established the University System of Georgia and the corresponding Georgia Board of Regents; unfortunately for Brittain and Georgia Tech, the board was composed almost entirely of graduates of the University of Georgia. In its final act on January 7, 1932, the Tech Board of Trustees {{sent a letter to}} the chairman of the Georgia Board of Regents outlining its <b>priorities</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> school. The Depression also affected enrollment, which dropped from 3,271 in 1931–1932 to a low of 2,482 in 1933–1934, and only gradually increased afterwards. It also caused a decrease in funding from the State of Georgia, which in turn caused a decrease in faculty salaries, firing of graduate student assistants, and a postponing of building renovations.|$|E
