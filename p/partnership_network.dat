40|$|Abstract Background Mental {{illnesses}} are {{the largest}} contributors to the global burden of non-communicable diseases. However, there is extremely limited access to high quality, culturally-sensitive, and contextually-appropriate mental healthcare services. This situation persists despite the availability of interventions with proven efficacy to improve patient outcomes. A <b>partnerships</b> <b>network</b> is necessary for successful program adaptation and implementation. <b>Partnerships</b> <b>network</b> We describe our <b>partnerships</b> <b>network</b> as a case example that addresses challenges in delivering mental healthcare and which {{can serve as a}} model for similar settings. Our perspectives are informed from integrating mental healthcare services within a rural public hospital in Nepal. Our approach includes training and supervising generalist health workers by off-site psychiatrists. This is made possible by complementing the strengths and weaknesses of the various groups involved: the public sector, a non-profit organization that provides general healthcare services and one that specializes in mental health, a community advisory board, academic centers in high- and low-income countries, and bicultural professionals from the diaspora community. Conclusions We propose a partnerships model to assist implementation of promising programs to expand access to mental healthcare in low- resource settings. We describe the success and limitations of our current partners in a mental health program in rural Nepal...|$|R

40|$|Building Effective <b>Partnership</b> <b>Networks</b> In {{order to}} engage {{communities}} around the world, engineering educators must build networks with relevant community organizations. Many factors can compound building effective networks. Organizations have different philosophies about how engineers should undertake community engagement. These philosophies include convictions that engineers should develop low-cost products suitable for markets in marginalized communities, engineers should devise clever solutions to help people living in poverty meet basic needs, engineers must effectively respond to socio-cultural considerations when proposing solutions, and engineers should work to empower local artisans who have already begun seeking solutions to pressing problems. Additionally, university programs have to overcome many geographic and relational barriers {{in order to have}} effective community access. This paper will discuss different strategies to build effective <b>partnership</b> <b>networks.</b> This paper uses discourse analysis to examine the advertised partnerships of four predominant engineering education programs working in global communities. I selected four engineering education programs with different guiding philosophies with a theoretically grounded sampling frame. The sampling frame relies on well-being frameworks found in international development scholarship. I reviewed all publicly available documentation that detailed the development of partnerships to determine how discourse models influenced building <b>partnership</b> <b>networks.</b> Preliminary results indicate that relational proximity rather than philosophical alignment tends to influence creating partnerships. While the four selected engineering education programs have different guiding philosophies, they also have distinct relational connections that create different models for partnerships. Engineering education programs can focus on building partnerships with organizations local to the university, with organizations local to the target community, with organizations that have a large global footprint, and with individuals within the target community. The paper will discuss how these different partnership models can inform how an engineering education program could develop partnerships more strongly aligned with the program’s guiding philosophy...|$|R
