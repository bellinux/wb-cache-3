50|$|The Akukan mine (Рудник Акукан) {{operated}} during 1927-1932 for {{the excavation}} of muscovite (<b>potash</b> <b>mica).</b> It {{was located in}} the Akukan Ravine of the Akukan River, north of Baikal Lake, Buryatia, 40 km North-East-East off Nizhneangarsk, 7 km North of the village Kholodnaya (now settlement Kholodhy).|$|E
5000|$|Muscovite (also {{known as}} common mica, isinglass, or <b>potash</b> <b>mica)</b> is a {{hydrated}} phyllosilicate mineral of aluminium and potassium with formula KAl2(AlSi3O10)(F,OH)2, or (KF)2(Al2O3)3(SiO2)6(H2O). It has a highly perfect basal cleavage yielding remarkably thin laminae (sheets) {{which are often}} highly elastic. Sheets of muscovite 5 m × 3 m {{have been found in}} Nellore, India.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cliffs of}} Moss Island are {{composed}} of metasyenite. Syenite is an igneous rock, similar to granite, composed of crystals of quartz (SiO2), alkali feldspar (a continuous mixture from KAlSi3O8 to NaAlSi3O8), and plagioclase feldspar (a mixture from CaAl2Si2O8 to NaAlSi3O8), with small quantities of muscovite (common, white or <b>potash</b> <b>mica),</b> biotitic (black mica, an iron rich version of muscovite), and hornblende (a black to dark green crystal mixture of calcium-iron-magnesium silicate, aluminum-iron-magnesium silicate and iron-magnesium silicate). The prefix [...] "meta-" [...] indicates that metasyenite is a metamorphic rock. After forming as an igneous rock, the syenite was subject to massive heat and pressure, which caused the minerals to rearrange, but not melt.|$|E
40|$|A {{complex of}} {{vermiculite}} with ethylene glycol was prepared by repeated boiling of a sodium-saturated cleavage flake in dry ethylene glycol. A stable product with a c period of 12, 9 A afforded 15 terms for a one-dimensional Fourier synthesis. A model composed of glycol molecules with {{the plane of}} the zigzag normal to the silicate face is found to be consistent with the observed iffraction data. The complex apparently conforms to a stoichiometrie ratio of two molecules per unit cell per layer of vermiculite. The essential ly iron-free vermicul ite in the Texas Mines magnesite quarry near Llano, Texas, vis ited on the Sunday field tr ip of this Conference (Barnes and Clabaugh, 1961, p. 51) has a cation-exchange capacity approaching the level commensurate with the two charge per a-b unit per layer level charac-teristic of the <b>potash</b> <b>micas</b> (Bradley and Serratosa, 1960, p. 262). A t tempts to prepare a glycolated complex direct ly from the natura l magnesium-saturated state resulted in an incompletely reacted product which retained an obvious significant residue of vermicul i te hydrat ion water (Bradley et el. ...|$|R
40|$|Ten surface soils {{belonging}} to orders viz., Vertisol, Inceptisol (mixed red and black) and Alfisol derived from diverse parent materials from major sugarcane growing areas of North Karnataka {{were considered to}} study the distribution of different forms of potassium and mineralogical composition of clay. The range in contents of various forms of potassium in different soils was 2. 0 to 24. 20 mg kg of water soluble K, 175. 50 to 429. 00 mg kg of exchangeable K, 150 to 1250 mg kg of non-exchangeable K, 175 to 450 kg ha of available K, 0. 51 to 3. 25 % of lattice K and 0. 58 to 3. 3 % of total potassium. The soils in general had contained medium to high available potassium with large total K reserve. The soil clays were dominantly smectitic in Vertisols and kaolinitic in Alfisol and Inceptisol. Inceptisol alone had recorded the presence of vermiculite (8. 5 %) and interestingly one of the Vertisols had contained almost equal amounts of kaolinite and montmorillonite. The <b>potash</b> bearing mineral <b>mica</b> was noticed in all the soil clays. Invariably, all Vertisols had contained about 10. 0 percent kaolinite in their clay fractions. The higher available K status of the Inceptisol soil {{could be attributed to}} the presence of potash rich minerals. The continuous sugarcane crop has not much reduced the available K status of these soils...|$|R
