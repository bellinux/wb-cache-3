40|$|Whole {{effluent}} assessments (WEA) {{are being}} investigated as potential tools for controlling aqueous industrial discharges and minimizing environmental impact. The present study investigated how toxicity {{and the presence}} of <b>potentially</b> <b>bioaccumulative</b> substances altered when refinery effluents were subjected to biodegradation tests. Three petrochemical effluents were assessed, two freshwater and one saline, and subjected to two different types of biodegradation tests, resembling either a ready style (dissolved organic carbon (DOC) -die away) or an inherent style (Zahn-Wellens) test and the toxicity and potential to bioaccumulate parameters were re-analysed during and after biodegradation. A high proportion of the <b>potentially</b> <b>bioaccumulative</b> substances (PBS) in these effluents was easily biodegradable. Biodegradation not only lowered the PBS concentration but also toxicity. Appropriate controls are required however, as some increases in toxicity were observed after 4 h. In the present study, six other petrochemical effluents were also assessed for their PBS content and toxicity to increase the understanding of the relationship between PBS and toxicity. The results showed that the PBS concentrations in these samples were lower than the estimated benchmarks of acute toxicity for algae, fish and crustacean, although two samples were above the critical PBS values for chronic narcotic toxicity for Daphnia magna, which support the assumption that narcotic effects are mainly responsible for the observed toxicity in refinery effluents. It can be concluded that for facilities processing petroleum products that the measurement of PBS is a suitable surrogate for toxicity tests at the screening stage. Finally, the combination of persistency, bioaccumulation, and toxicity tests was shown to have additional value compared to an approach using only toxicity tests. © 2011 SETAC...|$|E

40|$|Trace organic {{chemicals}} include {{a range of}} compounds which, due {{to a combination of}} their physico-chemical properties and toxicological implications, have been described as a serious threat to the biotic environment. A global treaty to regulate the manufacture and release {{of some of the most}} persistent trace chemicals has been promulgated and signed. The marine environment is an important sink for many trace chemicals, some of which accumulate in the marine food chain and in particular in marine mammals. With respect to the global distribution of trace {{organic chemicals}}, the levels of organohalogen compounds in the Southern Hemisphere are comparatively lower for a given environmental compartment and latitude compared to the Northern Hemisphere. A debate is currently evolving about the toxicity of alternative halogen substitutions such as bromine instead of chlorine and also of mixed halogen substitution. Recently a series of <b>potentially</b> natural <b>bioaccumulative</b> and persistent organohalogen chemicals have been found in marine mammals and turtles at levels in excess of those of anthropogenic trace organochlorines including PCBs and DDE. Little is known about the sources, behaviour and effects of natural trace organic chemicals. This manuscript presents an overview on the occurrence of trace organic chemicals in different compartments of the aquatic environment. Important knowledge gaps with regards to trace chemicals in the marine environment are presented. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of QSAR models {{useful for the}} prediction of fish bioconcentration factor (BCF) {{for a wide range}} of different chemical classes is crucial for the assessment and prioritisation of <b>potentially</b> persistent <b>bioaccumulative</b> and toxic substances. In this study we present QSAR models for BCF developed on a wide range of chemical structural classes of environmental and toxicological interest (such as dyes and various chlorinated and brominated compounds). The aim is to provide valid QSAR models, statistically validated for predictivity, for the prediction of BCF in general, but also for problematical chemical classes such as highly hydrophobic chemicals. Several descriptors, calculated by different commercially available software packages, have been employed in order to take into account relevant information provided by physicochemical properties (octanol/water partition coefficient and water solubility) and molecular features (structural and quantum-chemical molecular descriptors). The best descriptor subsets for the models were selected using the Genetic Algorithm-Variable Subset Selection strategy (GA-VSS) and calculations were performed by ordinary least squares regression. Starting from a data set of 640 compounds (log Kow range from - 2. 34 to 12. 66), we developed linear QSARs, firstly for a data set of 620 compounds (log Kow range from - 2. 34 to 10. 35) and secondly specifically for 87 highly hydrophobic chemicals (log Kow range from 6. 00 to 10. 35). All these models have been statistically validated (both internally by cross-validation and bootstrap and externally, by "a priori" splitting of available data by Kohonen Map-ANN in training and prediction sets) and their structural chemical domain has been verified by the leverage approach...|$|R
40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} (POPs) are typically monitored via targeted mass spectrometry, which potentially identifies {{only a fraction}} of the contaminants actually present in environmental samples. With new anthropogenic compounds continuously introduced to the environment, novel and proactive approaches that provide a comprehensive alternative to targeted methods are needed in order to more completely characterize the diversity of known and unknown compounds likely to cause adverse effects. Nontargeted mass spectrometry attempts to extensively screen for compounds, providing a feasible approach for identifying contaminants that warrant future monitoring. We employed a nontargeted analytical method using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC/TOF-MS) to characterize halogenated organic compounds (HOCs) in California Black skimmer (Rynchops niger) eggs. Our study identified 111 HOCs; 84 of these compounds were regularly detected via targeted approaches, while 27 were classified as typically unmonitored or unknown. Typically unmonitored compounds of note in bird eggs included tris(4 -chlorophenyl) methane (TCPM), tris(4 -chlorophenyl) methanol (TCPMOH), triclosan, permethrin, heptachloro- 1 '-methyl- 1, 2 '-bipyrrole (MBP), as well as four halogenated unknown compounds that could not be identified through database searching or the literature. The presence of these compounds in Black skimmer eggs suggests they are persistent, <b>bioaccumulative,</b> <b>potentially</b> biomagnifying, and maternally transferring. Our results highlight the utility and importance of employing nontargeted analytical tools to assess true contaminant burdens in organisms, as well as to demonstrate the value in using environmental sentinels to proactively identify novel contaminants...|$|R
40|$|Bioaccumulation is a {{chemical}} fate and transport process that frequently receives insufficient {{consideration in the}} ecological risk assessment (ERA) process. Bioaccumulative chemicals of potential ecological concern (COPECs) require special consideration because they generally have the highest exposure potential, and subsequently risk potential, to upper trophic level organisms. Even though relevant ERA guidance recognizes the importance of including bioaccumulation considerations in the ERA process, {{there are a number}} of factors that cannot be adequately addressed in general guidance, or ignored in an ERA. Therefore, the purposes of this paper are to discuss the issues and considerations regarding bioaccumulative, or <b>potentially</b> <b>bioaccumulative,</b> chemicals in the ERA process, and to present recent information relating to such chemicals, so that informed and well-planned risk decisions can be made.

40|$|Substances that {{accumulate}} to hazardous {{levels in}} living organisms pose environmental and human-health risks, which governments seek {{to reduce or}} eliminate. Regulatory authorities identify bioaccumulative substances as hydrophobic, fat-soluble chemicals having high octanol-water partition coefficients (KOW) (≥ 100, 000). Here we show that poorly metabolizable, moderately hydrophobic substances with a KOW between 100 and 100, 000, which do not biomagnify (that is, increase in chemical concentration in organisms with increasing trophic level) in aquatic food webs, can biomagnify to a high degree in food webs containing air-breathing animals (including humans) because of their high octanol-air partition coefficient (KOA) and corresponding low rate of respiratory elimination to air. These low KOW–high KOA chemicals, representing a third of organic chemicals in commercial use, constitute an unidentified class of <b>potentially</b> <b>bioaccumulative</b> substances that require regulatory assessment to prevent possible ecosystem and human-health consequences.

30|$|OW, the {{sorption}} of ions is {{more complex}} and not well understood so far—despite the fact that 49  % of the preregistered industrial chemicals under REACH [27] are charged compounds and may accumulate significantly in membranes. So far there is no approach to estimate the bioaccumulation potential of hydrophobic ions in regulation. For dissociating substances, log D {{can be used to}} assess the portion of the neutral and ionic forms of the substance and its partitioning between water and octanol depending on the pH in the environment. Hydrophobic ions may accumulate significantly in membranes and are <b>potentially</b> <b>bioaccumulative</b> due to their strong sorption to membrane lipids. This partitioning cannot be reliably modelled using bulk solvents. Fundamental differences between bulk-phase and membrane-water partitioning make a mechanistic modelling approach necessary for the treatment of ions. The use of the model COSMOmic for the prediction of partitioning of ionic species in membranes [28] in combination with an optimised membrane dipole potential was recommended as an alternative screening tool by Kai Bittermann, UFZ, Leipzig.|$|E
40|$|Perfluorinated acids (PFAs) are {{contaminants}} detected {{worldwide in}} a range of abiotic and biotic environmental matrices. The two major classes of PFAs include the perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs), both of which are considered persistent and <b>potentially</b> <b>bioaccumulative.</b> Current research and regulatory efforts are focussed on the straight-chain members of each PFA class and homologue group, primarily because these congeners are the major components of technical mixtures and are also available as pure standards. However, the numerous potential branched congeners in each PFA class represent a poorly understood family of environmental contaminants whose environmental and toxicological properties may be more important than the more prevalent straight-chain members. To help broaden the current understanding of PFA environmental fate and toxicology, semi-empirical computational methods were used predict fundamental physico-chemical properties of all potential C 4 to C 8 PCFA and PFSA congeners. Established quantitative structure-activity models for other multi-class emerging and legacy contaminants were applied to estimate key parameters related to the toxicology, environmental partitioning, and abiotic and biotic degradation mechanisms for each PFA class. The findings provide guidance for developing new analytical methods for separating and identifying PFAs in environmental and technical mixtures, prioritizing efforts on synthesizing authentic standards, and focussing toxicological studies on the congeners most likely to be of concern...|$|E
40|$|Processed {{municipal}} sewage sludges (MSS) are an abundant, unwanted by-product of wastewater treatment, increasingly applied to {{agriculture and forestry}} for inexpensive disposal and soil conditioning. Due to their high organic carbon and lipid contents, MSS not only is rich in carbon and nutrients but also represents a “sink” for recalcitrant, hydrophobic, and <b>potentially</b> <b>bioaccumulative</b> compounds. Indeed, many organics sequestered and concentrated in MSS meet the US Environmental Protection Agency’s definition of being persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT). In a strategic effort, our research team at the Biodesign Institute has created the National Sewage Sludge Repository (NSSR), a large repository of digested MSSs from 164 wastewater treatment plants from across the USA, {{as part of the}} Human Health Observatory (H 2 O) at Arizona State University (ASU). The NSSR likely represents the largest archive of digested MSS specimens in the USA. The present study summarizes key findings gleaned thus far from analysis of NSSR samples. For example, we evaluated the content of toxicants in MSS and computed estimates of nationwide inventories of mass produced chemicals that become sequestrated in sludge and later are released into the environment during sludge disposal on land. Ongoing efforts document co-occurrence of a variety of PBT compounds in both MSS and human samples, while also identifying a large number of potentially harmful MSS constituents for which human exposure data are still lacking. Finally, we summarize future opportunities and invite collaborative use of the NSSR by the research community. The H 2 O at ASU represents a new resource and research tool for environmental scientists and the larger research community. As illustrated in this work, this repository can serve to (i) identify and prioritize emerging contaminants, (ii) provide spatial and temporal trends of contaminants, (iii) inform and evaluate the effectiveness of environmental policy-making and regulations, and (iv) approximate, ongoing exposures and body burdens of mass-produced chemicals in human society.

40|$|Each {{and every}} one of us is exposed to {{chemicals}} on a daily basis and contributes to the global issue of chemical pollution. Humankind has become heavily dependent on the use of man-made chemicals in order to sustain the increased quality of life that is generally seen globally. There is however a price to pay in that we generally live in a world that is polluted by anthropogenic chemicals. From the water we drink to the food we eat there will be some trace of chemical residues; you just need to look closely enough and/or know what you’re looking for. With many hundreds of thousands of man-made chemicals approved within Europe for use in various ways, it is no surprise that we come into daily contact with them. What is also important to understand is that the presence of a man-made chemical is not enough to establish whether it poses a risk to environmental or human health; it needs to be present in sufficient amounts to elicit an effect. Over the past 20 years the focus of my research been on understanding which chemicals we should be concerned with, which pose the greatest risk and why do they pose such a risk. This work is of major societal and scientific significance as it protects the world we live in whilst teaching us about the better regulation of the chemicals we have become so dependent. To understand the nature of my research it is important to understand that prior to the mid-nineteen nineties hazardous organic chemicals were typically restricted to lists comprising of a number of banned (and typically chlorinated) pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans and the antifouling biocide tributyltin (TBT). One of the major enigmas that faced environmental scientists at the time was that even though it was possible to quantify and monitor the presence of the above hazardous substances in the environment, they often didn´t explain the environmental quality measured though biological effects on organisms. Chemicals are globally regulated on an individual substance level and subsequently within the context of influencing these regulations, for the improved protection of environmental and human health, it is therefore essential to know which chemical contaminants are actually causing biological effects. It is also necessary to know the levels at which any organism will be exposed and what the consequences of these levels. My research subsequently became focused on two separate approaches; identifying which substances actually cause the biological effects unexplained by hazardous substances and evaluating the occurrence, environmental fate and ecotoxicity of those chemicals not routinely monitored or present on priority lists of hazardous substances; a group of chemical contaminants later termed contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). An effect-directed non-target approach A targeted approach to environmental analysis infers that we know exactly what we should be looking for. Whilst this is a suitable approach for chemicals that we suspect may be of concern, it does not help us understand which other contaminants may be present in the environment and potentially causing harm. When embryos of oysters exposed to estuarine surface waters developed deformities and this could not be attributable to the levels of priority hazardous substances a bioassay-directed non-target approach to environmental analysis was developed to identify chlorinated and alkylphenols as responsible [5, 6]. This approach has subsequently evolved into the approach termed effect-directed analysis (EDA) and is widely used globally for the identification of CECs. My own research has successfully applied the approach to identify for the first time a number of important environmental contaminants; steroidal androgens [10, 13, 14] as environmental contaminants, the phthalate ester bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate [10], cinnarizine, cholesta- 4, 6. dien- 3 -one [19], C 1 -C 5 and C 9 alkylphenols [21], petrogenic naphthenic acids [57] as environmental estrogen receptor agonists, C 1 -C 5 and C 9 alkylphenols [21], PAHs and petrogenic naphthenic acids [57] as androgen receptor antagonists and unresolved polar aromatic compounds as important environmental genotoxins [15]. Another focus of my effects-directed research has been identifying environmental contaminants that exert the same effects as dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans in that they are aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists. Dioxin-like chemicals are ubiquitous in the environment and in addition to those that are routinely monitored there are a large number of other compounds that exert dioxin-like effects [26, 28, 32, 33, 37, 52, 64, 82, 93, 98, 99]. Better understanding of AhR agonists will in the long run help protect the environment and humans from a particularly hazardous group of chemicals. A targeted approach The early- to mid-nineteen nineties saw the widespread introduction of liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to the environmental analytical toolbox. Robust instruments typically using electrospray and atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation were well suited to the analysis of the more polar CECs, such as alternative antifouling biocides to TBT, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, veterinary medicines, illicit drugs and rodenticides. Robust analytical methodology is key to my research [2, 4, 18, 31, 34, 35, 42, 49, 66, 69, 72, 73, 86, 94, 102] as it allows the better understanding of how contaminants behave and interact with the environment. Development of robust, specific and sensitive methods for the analysis of alternative antifouling biocides [2, 4] allowed for the first time an evaluation of their life-cycle from release at the paint surface, and the factors that influence this [3], their occurrence in the environment [7, 8, 12, 29], fate and behaviour [12, 16] and subsequent effects [36, 41]. Assessment of the environmental risks based upon these data showed that both Irgarol 1051 and diuron were a threat to freshwater and marine algae. The significance of this research is that it subsequently led to restrictions being placed on the use of Irgarol 1051 and diuron in antifouling products in a number of European countries [58] and an awareness of the hazards associated with the deliberate release of biocidal products into the environment [86]. Observations of human pharmaceutical residues in the chromatograms of wastewater effluent samples being analysed by EDA and reports of their occurrence in German wastewaters motivated the development of LC- tandem MS methods for the quantification of pharmaceutical residues in waste- and surface waters [18]. Pharmaceuticals, we showed, occur in treated wastewater effluents and marine and freshwater recipients [24, 25, 30, 42, 43, 51, 66] and that, to no great surprise, the per capita pharmaceutical loads from hospitals were greater than the general population [43, 51]. Other highlights include understanding the processes that occur within sewer systems and what influences pharmaceutical occurrence in the final treated effluent [59, 60, 81, 85, 105], all of which allow for a better assessment of the overall risk posed to the environment. Even though several hundred papers have been published on pharmaceuticals in the environment since my early work, this has almost exclusively been focused on the parent pharmaceutical ingredient in aqueous matrices from developed counties. To remedy this shortfall more recent work has focused on quantifying the proportion of pharmaceutical metabolites released as compared to the parent [66], pharmaceutical occurrence in sludges and sediments [69], as well as evaluating occurrence in less studied water cycles [101]. My studies have shown that the risks associated with pharmaceutical metabolites are largely neglected and poorly understood and while we understand the releases of pharmaceuticals in Asia, Europe and North America, emissions of pharmaceuticals (and illicit drugs) in newly industrialised regions are also of significance [101]. As with biocides we were eager to understand the risks associated with the pharmaceutical exposure levels we were determining, however only acute short-term toxicity data were available which limited the possibility of evaluating any chronic long-term risks. A situation that is sadly not much better today. Linking causality to occurrence becomes easier however when the there is knowledge about the levels that can inflict a particular response in an organism, particularly when that response is mortality. An awareness of the potential of certain chemicals and their use has more recently led to better successes in linking occurrence with a particular response [86, 102]. For example my research has shown that second generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs) occur at levels above the potential lethal range in the livers of raptors found dead in Norway [86] and that chitin synthesis inhibitors used in controlling sea-lice in Norwegian fish farms pose a serious risk to any species that undergoes moulting during its lifecycle [102]. With so many pharmaceuticals in use, prioritising which pharmaceuticals to target posed a new challenge and one which led to the use of prescription data to predict influent loads [44]. These estimations proved to be effective and combined with reports of the occurrence of cocaine in Italian rivers and wastewaters stimulated an interest in illicit drugs and one of the earliest publications of a robust analytical method for the quantification of a number of commonly used drugs [42]. With a focus on generating quality data representative of that occurring within a specific community our initial focus was on understanding the temporal fluxes in drug loads and what influenced such changes [71, 72, 74, 85]. After being convinced that wastewater analyses offered an alternative to conventional epidemiological methods for generating population level data we proceeded to develop the first wastewater biomarker for alcohol consumption, based upon ethylsufate [73], include for the first time new psychoactive substances in our analyses and a strategy for their identification [94, 97] and proposed that wastewater-based epidemiology had the potential to tell more about a community than just their drug use, provided the first comparison with conventional epidemiological data [84] and for the first time presented the hypothesis that wastewater contained indigenous and exogenous biomarkers of human interactions with their environment and that quantitative measurements of these biomarkers could be used to relate to health, diet, lifestyle and environment [75]. Large spatial studies were necessary to demonstrate that wastewater-based epidemiology had a role to play in providing useful data to drug and crime monitoring agencies. In 2010, I initiated the first Europe-wide spatial study that has generated comparable drug use data for up to 50 European cities from 2011 and is ingoing [79, 100], and allowed for the first time an assessment of the uncertainties associated with a wastewater-based approach [95]. Integrated sampling for improved characterisation Accurate characterisation of chemical contamination very much requires that the samples we analyse are representative of the environment. A complementary focus of my research has been the application of passive sampling techniques [46, 47, 53, 55, 71, 88, 89]. Such techniques can provide time-integrated samples that better describe the environments that I am characterising. They are particularly suitable for monitoring in hostile and difficult environments, such as off-shore around oil platforms [46, 47, 53, 55], whilst providing an effective tool for the long term monitoring of CECs [71] and cleaner extracts for coupling with non-targted analytical approaches for identifying unknown contaminants that are <b>potentially</b> <b>bioaccumulative</b> [88, 89]. A particularly novel passive sampling tool that we have used is explanted silicone implants that have huge potential for biomonitoring and have also led to a potential tool for cleaning contaminated bodies of chemicals [133]. Summary The presented body of work represents 20 years research to better understand the influence of chemicals on environmental and human health. My research has resulted in the improved understanding of which chemicals affect the environment and pose the greatest risk. As described above, I was one of the first researchers to report the environmental risks posed by certain CECs that provoked the major research effort that we see today. This includes some of the earliest works on the presence of specific environmental endocrine disrupters, in particular androgen receptor agonists and antagonists, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, and engineered nanoparticles that has lead to the implementation of improved wastewater treatment and better societal awareness of chemicals in consumer goods. Direct impacts of this work have been restrictions in the use of Irgarol 1051 and diuron in most European countries following my seminal work on antifouling paint biocides and their inclusion in the Water Framework Directive´s list of priority substances, banning the use of second generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs) for amateur use in Norway and brought focus on the dependence of the Norwegian fish farming industry on veterinary medicines. My influential work with using sewage to estimate illicit drug use has lead to a new paradigm as to how this is performed in Europe and afield and reported to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiciton and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.
