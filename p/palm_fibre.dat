Experimental tests were conducted at different applied loads (5 - 20 N) and two different rotational speeds (50 and 100 r/min) for 0. 18 km sliding distance using a dry sand/steel wheel apparatus. The flow of the sand particles (560 - 900 mu m) was 4. 5 g/s. Morphologies of the worn surface of the composites were studied using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Pull-out test was carried out to evaluate the interfacial adhesion characteristics of treated and untreated fibres. The results revealed that composites based on treated oil <b>palm</b> <b>fibres</b> exhibited better wear performance compared with untreated ones, i. e. the interfacial adhesion of treated fibres to the polyester was better than untreated fibres. Moreover, treated oil <b>palm</b> <b>fibres</b> were found to reduce the porosity of the composite, which in turn stabilized the surface tribo-characteristics. Based on the SEM analysis, the wear mechanisms were predominated by pitting, grooving, microcracking, microcutting, and fracture in the polyester region...|$|R

Two different types of OPRP composites were fabricated, which were based on treated and untreated oil <b>palm</b> <b>fibres</b> (treated oil <b>palm</b> fibre-reinforced polyester (T-OPRP) and untreated oil palm fibre-reinforced polyester (UT-OPRP), respectively). The experiments were conducted using two different techniques, pin-on-disc (POD) and block-on-ring (BOR), integrated into the same tribo-machine. The tests were conducted at different rotational speeds (500 and 700 r/min) and 50 N applied load for different durations (10 – 60 min).
