5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} {{is traditionally}} {{divided into three}} parts: the inner, middle and outer magnetosphere. The inner magnetosphere is located at distances closer than 10RJ from the planet. The magnetic field within it remains approximately dipole, because contributions from the currents flowing in the magnetospheric equatorial <b>plasma</b> <b>sheet</b> are small. In the middle (between 10 and 40RJ) and outer (further than 40RJ) magnetospheres, the magnetic field is not a dipole, and is seriously disturbed by its interaction with the <b>plasma</b> <b>sheet</b> (see magnetodisk below).|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetic}} field is fourteen times {{as strong as}} that of Earth, ranging from 4.2gauss (0.42 mT) at the equator to 10–14 gauss (1.0–1.4 mT) at the poles, making it the strongest in the Solar System (except for sunspots). This field {{is thought to be}} generated by eddy currents—swirling movements of conducting materials—within the liquid metallic hydrogen core. The volcanoes on the moon Io emit large amounts of sulfur dioxide forming a gas torus along the moon's orbit. The gas is ionized in the magnetosphere producing sulfur and oxygen ions. They, together with hydrogen ions originating from the atmosphere of Jupiter, form a <b>plasma</b> <b>sheet</b> in Jupiter's equatorial plane. The plasma in the sheet co-rotates with the planet causing deformation of the dipole {{magnetic field}} into that of magnetodisk. Electrons within the <b>plasma</b> <b>sheet</b> generate a strong radio signature that produces bursts in the range of 0.6–30MHz.|$|E
5|$|The {{current flowing}} from the {{ionosphere}} to the <b>plasma</b> <b>sheet</b> is especially strong when the corresponding part of the <b>plasma</b> <b>sheet</b> rotates slower than the planet. As mentioned above, co-rotation breaks down in the region located between 20 and 40RJ from Jupiter. This region corresponds to the magnetodisk, where the magnetic field is highly stretched. The strong direct current flowing into the magnetodisk originates in a very limited latitudinal range of about ° from the Jovian magnetic poles. These narrow circular regions correspond to Jupiter's main auroral ovals. (See below.) The return current {{flowing from the}} outer magnetosphere beyond 50RJ enters the Jovian ionosphere near the poles, closing the electrical circuit. The total radial current in the Jovian magnetosphere is estimated at 60 million–140million amperes.|$|E

40|$|Considering CuO_ 2 {{conducting}} layers {{present in}} high Tc superconductors as <b>plasma</b> <b>sheets,</b> {{we proposed a}} prescription for the T_c pressure behavior taken into account the Casimir effect. The Casimir energy arises from these parallel <b>plasma</b> <b>sheets</b> (Cu-O planes) when it take placed in the regime of nanometer scale (small d distance). The charge reservoir layer supplies carries to the conducting nCuO_ 2 layers, which {{are a source of}} superconductivity. The pressure induced charge transfer model (PICTM) makes use of an intrinsic term, which description is still unclear. Considering Casimir energy describing the T_c for the case of hight-T_c superconductors, we propose an explicit expression to the intrinsic term. Realistic parameters used in the proposed expression have shown an agreement with experimental intrinsic term data observed in some high-T_c compounds. Comment: 8 pages, Revte...|$|R

5|$|The {{configuration}} of the magnetodisk's field is maintained by the azimuthal ring current (not an analog of Earth's ring current), which flows with rotation through the equatorial <b>plasma</b> <b>sheet.</b> The Lorentz force resulting from the interaction of this current with the planetary magnetic field creates a centripetal force, which keeps the co-rotating plasma from escaping the planet. The total ring current in the equatorial current sheet is estimated at 90–160million amperes.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} described above is {{sustained by the}} neutral sheet current (also known as the magnetotail current), which flows with Jupiter's rotation through the tail <b>plasma</b> <b>sheet,</b> the tail currents, which flow against Jupiter's rotation at the outer boundary of the magnetotail, and the magnetopause currents (or Chapman–Ferraro currents), which flow against rotation along the dayside magnetopause. These currents create the magnetic field that cancels the internal field outside the magnetosphere. They also interact substantially with the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|The main {{driver of}} Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} is the planet's rotation. In this respect Jupiter {{is similar to}} a device called a Unipolar generator. When Jupiter rotates, its ionosphere moves relatively to the dipole magnetic field of the planet. Because the dipole magnetic moment points {{in the direction of the}} rotation, the Lorentz force, which appears as a result of this motion, drives negatively charged electrons to the poles, while positively charged ions are pushed towards the equator. As a result, the poles become negatively charged and the regions closer to the equator become positively charged. Since the magnetosphere of Jupiter is filled with highly conductive plasma, the electrical circuit is closed through it. A current called the direct current flows along the magnetic field lines from the ionosphere to the equatorial <b>plasma</b> <b>sheet.</b> This current then flows radially away from the planet within the equatorial <b>plasma</b> <b>sheet</b> and finally returns to the planetary ionosphere from the outer reaches of the magnetosphere along the field lines connected to the poles. The currents that flow along the magnetic field lines are generally called field-aligned or Birkeland currents. The radial current interacts with the planetary magnetic field, and the resulting Lorentz force accelerates the magnetospheric plasma in the direction of planetary rotation. This is the main mechanism that maintains co-rotation of the plasma in Jupiter's magnetosphere.|$|E
40|$|Ionospheric HF heating {{experiments}} were conducted at Gakona, Alaska to investigate (1) ionospheric ducts (viz., large <b>plasma</b> <b>sheets</b> acting as parallel-plate waveguides) and (2) cascading spectra of Langmuir wave turbulence, excited by large- and short-scale plasma instabilities, respectively. The first subject {{is inspired by}} our earlier Arecibo experiments [Lee et al., 1998] whereby sheet-like ionospheric ducts were generated by HF heater waves and detected by Arecibo radar. The second one is aimed at testing our theory of [Kuo and Lee, 2005] that addresses how the cascade of Langmuir waves can distribute spatially via the resonant and non-resonant decay processes. 1. Motivations During 2005 - 2007 we have conducted experiments at Gakona, Alaska to investigate field-aligned large-scale ionospheric plasma irregularities (i. e., ionospheric ducts) and spatial distribution of Langmuir waves generated by the HAARP HF heater. It is expected that sheet-like ionospheric density irregularities can be excited above Gakona within minutes by vertically injected O-mode and X-mode heater waves. This expectation is based on our theory of thermal filamentation instabilities [1] and the detection of large <b>plasma</b> <b>sheets</b> in our 1997 Arecibo experiments [2].

In the Voyager data, there is no convincing evidence for such ring matter.

In this regime, alternating prism phases with square and triangular basis, structures derived from a hcp bulk lattice, and a structure with two outer layers and two inner staggered rectangular layers, reminiscent of a Belgian waffle iron, are stable.

2500|$|Saturn's {{magnetosphere}} {{is often}} {{divided into four}} regions. The innermost region co-located with Saturn's planetary rings, inside approximately 3Rs, has a strictly dipolar magnetic field. It is largely devoid of plasma, which is absorbed by ring particles, although the radiation belts of Saturn are located in this innermost region just {{inside and outside the}} rings. The second region between 3 and 6Rs contains the cold plasma torus and is called the inner magnetosphere. It contains the densest plasma in the saturnian system. The plasma in the torus originates from the inner icy moons and particularly from Enceladus. The magnetic field in this region is also mostly dipolar. [...] The third region lies between 6 and 12–14Rs and is called the dynamic and extended <b>plasma</b> <b>sheet.</b> The magnetic field in this region is stretched and non-dipolar, whereas the plasma is confined to a thin equatorial <b>plasma</b> <b>sheet.</b> The fourth outermost region is located beyond 15Rs at high latitudes and continues up to magnetopause boundary. It is characterized by a low plasma density and a variable, non-dipolar magnetic field strongly influenced by the Solar wind.|$|E
50|$|The <b>plasma</b> <b>sheet</b> {{is a very}} dynamic structure, in a {{constant}} state of motion, so as the Moon orbits through the magnetotail the <b>plasma</b> <b>sheet</b> can sweep across it many times with encounters lasting anywhere from minutes to hours or even days.|$|E

40|$|Pulsar {{winds are}} the ideal {{environment}} {{for the study of}} non-linear electromagnetic waves. It is generally thought that a pulsar launches a striped wind, a magnetohydrodynamic entropy wave, where <b>plasma</b> <b>sheets</b> carried along with the flow separate regions of alternating magnetic field. But when the density drops below a critical value, or equivalently for distances from the pulsar greater than a critical radius, a strong superluminal wave can also propagate. In this contribution we discuss the conversion of the equatorial striped wind into a linearly polarized superluminal wave, and we argue that this mode is important for the conversion of Poynting flux to kinetic energy flux before the outflow reaches the termination shock.

We investigate the contribution of both types of modes to the Casimir force and confirm resp. find in both models large compensations between the plasmon modes themselves and between them and the photon modes especially at large distances. Our conclusion is that the separation of the vacuum energy into plasmon and photon contributions must be handled with care except for the case of small separations.
