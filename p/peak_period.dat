5|$|Reading is an {{important}} commercial centre in the Thames Valley and Southern England. The town hosts the headquarters of several British companies and the UK offices of foreign multinationals, {{as well as being}} a major retail centre. Whilst located close enough to London to be sometimes regarded as part of the London commuter belt, Reading is a net inward destination for commuters. During the morning <b>peak</b> <b>period,</b> there are some 30,000 inward arrivals in the town, compared to 24,000 departures.|$|E
5|$|After the {{unification}} of the peninsula up to Taedong River in 668 AD, Gyeongju {{became the center of}} Korean political and cultural life. The city was home to the Silla court and the great majority of the kingdom's elite.

Records of Samguk Yusa give the city's population in its <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> as 178,936 households, suggesting that the total population was almost one million. Many of Gyeongju's most famous sites date from this Unified Silla period, which ended in the late 9th century by Goryeo (918–1392).|$|E

5|$|Columbia Records {{executive}} Tommy Mottola {{had approached}} Anthony {{to sign a}} contract with the company to record an album in English during the <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> of Latin artists crossing over the Anglophone market. Nonetheless, his contract with RMM denied Anthony the right to perform in Spanish for Colombia Records. This resulted in a lawsuit against Mercado because Anthony did not want to work under him anymore. As part of the settlement, RMM Records retained the rights to his earlier albums and to release a greatest hits collection from them while Anthony no longer had any obligations to RMM.|$|E
5|$|Marysville ranks eighth among Washington {{cities for}} longest commute times, {{with an average}} commute of {{approximately}} 30 minutes.

On April 22, 2014, Marysville voters approved the creation of a city transportation benefit district and a 0.2 percent sales tax to fund transportation improvements in the city, including road repairs, bicycle and pedestrian access, and new capital projects.|$|E
5|$|One alternative, {{aimed at}} {{avoiding}} inequality and revenue allocation issues, is {{to implement a}} rationing of <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> travel through mobility rights or revenue-neutral credit-based congestion pricing. This system {{would be similar to}} the existing emissions trading of carbon credit. Metropolitan area or city residents, or the taxpayers, would be issued mobility rights or congestion credits, and would have the option of using these for themselves, or trading or selling them to anyone willing to continue traveling by automobile beyond their personal quota. This trading system would allow direct benefits to be accrued by those users shifting to public transportation or by those reducing their peak-hour travel rather than the government.|$|E

With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay £10 per day to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of central London. Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a greatly reduced season pass. London government initially expected the Congestion Charge Zone to increase daily <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> Underground and bus users by 20,000 people, reduce road traffic by 10 to 15 per cent, increase traffic speeds by 10 to 15 per cent, and reduce queues by 20 to 30 per cent.
