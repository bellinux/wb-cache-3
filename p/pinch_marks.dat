5000|$|In southwestern Ontario (Canada), {{there is}} an {{extension}} of this style wherein the 9s are removed from the deck and up to four [...] "Bennys" [...] are added. These usually take the form of either one or two Jokers and/or one or two Deuces (of differing colour, usually the Deuce of spades and, optionally, the Deuce of hearts). This is colloquially known as [...] "Railroad Euchre" [...] and in its simplest form (with only a single Joker or Deuce), it is identical to the English variant listed previously. As with the earlier description, the additional cards are ranked trump ahead of the right bower, regardless of the suit of trump with Deuce(s) outranking Jokers. In the case where two Jokers are added, some method is achieved for establishing a [...] "high" [...] and a [...] "low" [...] Joker. Often the cards are differentiated in some way by the manufacturer which makes this easy; for example, a coloured Joker (high) versus a black-and-white one (low), or by some other mark that distinguishes the two cards (in a <b>pinch,</b> <b>marks</b> can be added manually, but this is discouraged as it may render the card identifiable from the back). In any event, the [...] "high" [...] Joker always outranks the low. If one Deuce is used, it is always the highest trump in the deck. If two are used, the Deuce matching the colour of trump is highest. Turning up a Joker or Deuce on the deal is handled {{in the same way as}} described in the English method above. Although Railroad Euchre is somewhat complicated and often takes a few hands even for experienced Euchre players to grow accustomed to, the addition of up to four higher-ranking trump cards makes a significant strategic impact in the way the game is played. For clarification, assuming the addition of both deuces and both jokers, and if spades or clubs is called trump, the ranking of the four highest trump cards would be 2♠, 2♥, Joker(high), and Joker(low), with the normal progression of trump from the right bower on down thereafter. If hearts or diamonds were trump instead, the ranks of the top four cards would change to: 2♥, 2♠, Joker(high), and Joker(low). The popularity of the Railroad variants appears to decrease as more trump are added with the two and three Benny versions being the most common.|$|E
40|$|My {{work is a}} {{translation}} of memories, experiences, and languages into shapes, colors, and symbols. The fragmented relationship with my cultural identity is easier to deconstruct when paired down to an exploration of process, form, and color. Ideas of containment, strength, and beauty are translated into line, form, and color. A color palette that is predominantly white and black represents my cultural dichotomy. Addressing a perpetual, yet elusive, quest for balance, these colors coexist within forms but are never seamlessly integrated. I address dichotomies directly through process. Through pinching, coiling, slab-building, and wheelthrowing I vacillate between the need for structure {{and the desire to}} capture a playful spontaneity. Strong visual cues - patterns, repetition of forms, contrasting colors - reconcile these desires and establish a visual coherence. <b>Pinch</b> <b>marks</b> create a visual rhythm, imbuing the forms with a casual relaxation. Precise geometric forms serve as a study of not only visual, but also structural, typologies. A vocabulary of architectural forms is implemented to represent strength, fortitude, and time. Form and shape exploration facilitate my personal visual language development. This language which utilizes simplified shapes is composed to exhibit a visual tension, or playful awkwardness, that translates into a sensory experience, both visually and tactilely. Personal and formal fragmentation are addressed not only through visual cues but also through the idea of containment that unites the work. The idea of containment serves as anchor - visual, emotional, cultural. Advisor: Margaret Bohl...|$|E

In the seventh inning, a double by Colby Rasmus with no outs scored Mark DeRosa to put St. Louis ahead 2-1, but Rasmus was thrown out at third base, which ended up being a huge play. At the time, it seemed to be enough to allow Wainwright to pitch to victory; in the eighth inning, however, he pitched into a bases-loaded jam.

40|$|At {{temperatures}} {{of several hundred}} million degrees, in deuterium, the energy generated by nuclear re-actions will exceed the radiation loss. This fact suggested to one of us (G. P. T.), in 1946, that useful power might be generated from such reactions, pro-vided {{that the loss of}} energy to the walls could be sufficiently reduced by magnetic fields. Experiments were begun at Imperial College, London, in February 1947, to produce very large currents in a low-pressure gas discharge. The containment of the gas was to be achieved by the pinch effect and a toroidal discharge tube was used to eliminate end losses. Currents in the range 1 x 104 - 2 x 104 amp were induced in the gas by discharging a condenser of maximum energy 400 joules through a primary winding coupled with the gas. 1 These experiments were the first to demonstrate a <b>marked</b> <b>pinch</b> effect in a gas discharge, although inertial effects caused the contracting discharge to overswing and expand again, followed by further contractions and expansions. 2 In order to achieve {{temperatures of}} several million degrees and demonstrate a thermonuclear reaction it was clear from the Bennett 3 relation, 2 NkT = 72, that currents of the order 105 amp were required. (N is the total number of particles per unit length of the discharge, k Boltzmann's constant, T the tempera-ture and / the current.) When, however, the condenser energy was increased in 1950 to 18, 000 joules, serious crazing and evaporation of the small Pyrex glass dis-charge tubes occurred and it became necessary to develop superior materials to contain the large currents.

Validated human assays {{for many of these}} biomarkers have become commercially available, and {{this study was designed to}} characterize some of the novel clinical renal biomarkers. The objective of this study was to evaluate clinical renal biomarkers in a typical Phase I healthy volunteer population to determine confidence intervals (pilot reference intervals), intersubject and intrasubject variability, effects of food intake, effect of sex, and vendor assay comparisons. Methods: Spot urine samples from 20 male and 19 female healthy volunteers collected on multiple days were analyzed using single analyte and multiplex assays. The following analytes were measured: α- 1 -microglobulin, β- 2 -microglobulin, calbindin, clusterin, connective tissue growth factor, creatinine, cystatin C, glutathione S-transferase-α, kidney injury marker- 1, microalbumin, N-acetyl-β-(D) glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, osteopontin, Tamm-Horsfall urinary glycoprotein, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, trefoil factor 3, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Results: Confidence intervals were determined from the single analyte and multiplex assays. Intersubject and intrasubject variability ranged from 38 % to 299 % and from 29 % to 82 % for biomarker concentration, and from 24 % to 331 % and from 10 % to 67 % for biomarker concentration normalized to creatinine, respectively. There was no major effect of food intake or sex. Single analyte and multiplex assays correlated with r 2 ≥ 0. 700 for five of six biomarkers when evaluating biomarker concentration, but for only two biomarkers when evaluating concentration normalized to creatinine. Conclusion: Confidence intervals as well as intersubject and intrasubject variability were determined for novel clinical renal biomarkers/assays, which should be considered for evaluation in the next steps of the qualification process.

Newer and more sensitive preclinical drug-induced kidney injury biomarkers are now qualified for use in rat toxicology studies, but biomarkers for clinical studies are still undergoing qualification. The current studies investigated biomarkers in healthy volunteer (HV) urine samples with and without the addition of stabilizer as well as in urine from patients with normoalbuminuric diabetes mellitus (P-DM). Methods: Urine samples from 20 male HV with stabilizer, 69 male HV without stabilizer, and 95 male DM without stabilizer (39 type 1 and 56 type 2) were analyzed for the following biomarkers using multiplex assays: α- 1 -microglobulin (A 1 M), β- 2 -microglobulin, calbindin, clusterin, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), creatinine, cystatin-C, glutathione s-transferase α (GSTα), kidney injury marker- 1 (KIM- 1), microalbumin, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, osteopontin, Tamm–Horsfall urinary glycoprotein (THP), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, trefoil factor 3 (TFF 3), and vascular endothelial growth factor. Results: CTGF and GSTα assays on nonstabilized urine were deemed nonoptimal (> 50 % of values below assay lower limits of quantification). “Expected values” were determined for HV with stabilizer, HV without stabilizer, and P-DM without stabilizer. There was a statistically significant difference between HV with stabilizer compared to HV without stabilizer for A 1 M, CTGF, GSTα, and THP. DM urine samples differed from HV (without stabilizer) for A 1 M CTGF, GSTα, KIM- 1, microalbumin, osteopontin, and TFF 3. A 1 M also correctly identified HV and DM with an accuracy of 89. 0 %. Summary: These studies: 1) determined that nonstabilized urine can be used for assays under qualification; and 2) documented that A 1 M, CTGF, GSTα, KIM- 1, microalbumin, osteopontin, and TFF 3 were significantly increased in urine from P-DM. In addition, the 89. 0 % accuracy of A 1 M in distinguishing P-DM from HV may allow this biomarker to be used to monitor efficacy of potential renal protective agents.
