In this type of transaction, the acquisition price is usually priced at premium above the exchange price.

First, {{is that there is}} a positive relationship between <b>premiums</b> <b>paid</b> and target 2 ̆ 7 s stock liquidity. And second, {{is that there is a}} positive relationship between <b>premiums</b> <b>paid</b> and information quality. These hypotheses are tested using historical data of such acquisition transactions that comprise at least 20 ° 0 of target 2 ̆ 7 s equity and that have been occurred in the Indonesian stock exchange during 2000 - 2010. The findings suggest that stock turnover, as a proxy for stock liquidity, and auditor selection, as a proxy for information quality; do have significant impact on the <b>premiums</b> <b>paid,</b> which confirm previous studies. However, unlike a priori expectation, the relationship between stock liquidity and the <b>premiums</b> <b>paid</b> is negative.
