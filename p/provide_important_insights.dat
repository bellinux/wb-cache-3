25|$|As a {{young man}} the Utrecht-born artist Hendrick de Keyser was apprenticed to master Cornelis Bloemaert the elder. At the age of 26 he {{followed}} Bloemaert to Amsterdam. Soon he set to work as an independent artist. When his talent became generally appreciated he was appointed city stonemason and sculptor. In fact his duties included all of the tasks now associated with the job of city architect. De Keyser is famous {{for a number of}} important buildings which belong to the core of Dutch historic sites. Today the Zuiderkerk (1603-1611) and accompanying tower (1614), the Delft Town Hall (1618-1620), the Westerkerk (1620-1631) and Westertoren (built in 1638 but in a modified version) are among the historic buildings which <b>provide</b> <b>important</b> <b>insights</b> into De Keyser’s work. His Commodity Exchange of 1608-1613 was pulled down in the 19th century.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{preserve}} sleep the dreamwork disguises the repressed or [...] "latent" [...] content of the dream in an interplay of words and images which Freud describes in terms of condensation, displacement and distortion. This produces the [...] "manifest content" [...] of the dream as recounted in the dream narrative. For Freud an unpleasant manifest content may still represent the fulfilment of a wish {{on the level of}} the latent content. In the clinical setting Freud encouraged free association to the dream's manifest content in order to facilitate access to its latent content. Freud believed interpreting dreams in this way could <b>provide</b> <b>important</b> <b>insights</b> into the formation of neurotic symptoms and contribute to the mitigation of their pathological effects.|$|E
