5|$|Chicago {{tight end}} John Gilmore picked up Vinatieri's {{bouncing}} kickoff {{and returned it}} 9-yards to his own 45-yard line, with an unnecessary roughness <b>penalty</b> <b>on</b> Mathis adding another 15yards and giving the Bears a first down on the Colts' 40-yard line.

5|$|Following Georgia Tech's post-score kickoff, Wake Forest {{received}} the ball, {{but failed to}} gain a first down. The Deacons' offense went three and out {{and was forced to}} punt. On Tech's next possession, they too had difficulty moving the football on offense. Though they picked up a first down off of a <b>penalty</b> <b>on</b> Wake Forest, they were unable to gain a first down by their own devices and were forced to punt the ball away.|$|E
5|$|Race {{stewards}} initially {{imposed a}} 10-place <b>penalty</b> <b>on</b> Coulthard and Barrichello, for changing their engines prior to qualification. Since 2006, the engines of Formula One cars {{are required to}} last for two races. However, after further investigation they rescinded Coulthard's penalty, as he had retired from the previous race and his change had been made {{before the start of}} the race weekend. Barrichello's penalty stood.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the duty to act fairly varies greatly from case to case. Basic norms of {{fairness}} {{in the conduct of}} disciplinary proceedings need to be observed more strictly where the vocational future of a person is at stake, where there is an express duty on an association to make a decision only after conducting a hearing or an inquiry, and where the exercise of disciplinary powers may deprive a person of his or her property rights or impose a <b>penalty</b> <b>on</b> him or her.|$|E

He scored his 300th career goal from a <b>penalty</b> <b>on</b> 15 December 2002, in Brescia's 3–1 home victory over Perugia, also setting-up one of Igli Tare's goals. Baggio was the first player in over 50 years to reach this milestone, and with 318 goals, he is the fourth-highest scoring Italian player in all competitions, behind only Silvio Piola, Alessandro Del Piero and Giuseppe Meazza.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo {{received}} the ball first {{to begin the}} game, and returned the opening kickoff to their own 24-yard line. They were unable to move the ball in threeplays, and punted the ball to Connecticut. The Huskies took possession on their own 18-yard line and drove down the field with alternating rushes by running back Donald Brown and quarterback Tyler Lorenzen, earning two first downs. On 2nddownand5 from the UConn 49-yard line, Lorenzen was sacked by Buffalo's Sherrod Lott and fumbled; the ball was recovered by UConn right tackle Mike Hicks, allowing the Huskies to retain possession. A holding <b>penalty</b> <b>on</b> the next play called on UConn left tackle William Beatty set up 3rd-and-24. Donald Brown rushed for fifteenyards {{but was unable to}} reach the first-down marker, forcing UConn to punt.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the Assistant Official Assignee, James Walter Davy Ambrose (who {{was later}} {{appointed}} a High Court Judge), to study law, Choor Singh enrolled as an external {{student at the}} University of London, passing the matriculation examination and intermediate LL.B. examination. In 1948 he was appointed a coroner, and the following year was elevated to the post of magistrate, becoming the first Indian to hold such a position in colonial Malaya. Following law studies at Gray's Inn on a government scholarship, he became a Barrister-at-Law in 1955. He was appointed a district judge in 1960 and a judge of the Supreme Court in 1963. Especially noted for his criminal judgments, Singh was the first Singapore judge to impose the death <b>penalty</b> <b>on</b> a woman.|$|E

5|$|Estre {{was issued}} with a drive-through penalty {{after he was}} adjudged to have caused the {{collision}} between himself and Tandy. Tandy stopped his Porsche briefly at the pit lane entry, while Bonanomi went wide driving up to Radallion corner battling Wurz for sixth. The incident involving Hartley handed the No. 17 Porsche a 15-second, stop-and-go penalty as he was deemed not to have respected track limits and causing danger to marshals. Bernhard took the <b>penalty</b> <b>on</b> the 17th lap, promoting teammate Jani to the lead. Evans moved {{to the front of}} the LMP2 field after overtaking Canal heading into the Bus Stop chicane. Fässler ceded third position to Duval at Les Combes corner.|$|E
5|$|Former {{teammate}} Ian Snodin {{invited him}} to join Football Conference side Doncaster Rovers on a short-term deal {{at the start of}} the 1997–98 season. He signed with Wes Saunders's Torquay United of the Third Division in December 1998. He saved a <b>penalty</b> <b>on</b> his debut at Plainmoor, in a 2–0 win over Hull City and signed a contract lasting until the end of the 1998–99 campaign. He was named as Torquay's Player of the Year at the end of the season. However, on 29 January 2000, he picked up a concussion in a 2–1 defeat to Chester City at the Deva Stadium, and was substituted. Though he recovered from his injury after the match, he left the club not long afterwards.|$|E
5|$|From that point, Pegues {{rushed for}} 13 {{yards on the}} first play of the drive, giving the Hokies a first down at their 24-yard line. Two more rushes by Pegues gained seven yards, then North Carolina {{committed}} a five-yard offsides penalty, giving the Hokies a first down at the 36-yard line. Clark threw an incomplete pass, Pegues was tackled for no gain on a running play, then Tech committed a five-yard delay of game <b>penalty.</b> <b>On</b> third down, Clark was sacked for a loss, and Tech punted. The kick was partially blocked, allowing North Carolina to return {{the ball to the}} 45-yard line of Virginia Tech. The Tar Heels thus began a drive inside Virginia Tech territory with 3:33 remaining in the first half.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of {{mortgage}} prepayment <b>penalties</b> <b>on</b> borrowers’ prepayments and delinquencies by exploiting a 2007 reform in Italy that reduced <b>penalties</b> <b>on</b> outstanding mortgages and banned <b>penalties</b> <b>on</b> newly-issued mortgages. Using a unique dataset of mortgages issued by a large Italian lender, we provide evidence that: 1) before the reform, mortgages issued to riskier borrowers included larger penalties; 2) higher prepayment penalties decreased borrowers’ prepayments; and 3) higher prepayment penalties did not affect borrowers’ delinquencies. Moreover, we find suggestive evidence that prepayment penalties affected mortgage pricing, as well as prepayments and delinquencies through borrowers’ mortgage selection at origination, most notably for riskier borrowers...|$|R

5|$|In 1883, Cornell {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{university}} campuses to use electricity to light the grounds from a water-powered dynamo. In 1904, a hydroelectric plant was built in the Fall Creek gorge. The plant takes water from Beebe Lake through a tunnel in the side of the gorge to power up to 1.9 megawatts of electricity. The plant continued to serve the campus's electric needs until 1970, when local utility rates placed a heavy economic <b>penalty</b> <b>on</b> independently generating electricity. The abandoned plant was vandalized in 1972, but renovated and placed back into service in 1981.|$|E
5|$|In the off-season, Rome re-signed with Vancouver to a two-year, $1.5 million contract. He scored for {{the first}} time as a Canuck on March 29, 2011, an empty netter in a 3–1 win against the Nashville Predators. It was his first goal in 109 games. Rome {{finished}} the 2010–11 season with an NHL career-high 56 games with a goal and four assists. In the 2011 playoffs, he scored his first NHL post-season goal against Antti Niemi of the San Jose Sharks in Game 2 of the third round– a 7–3 win. The following game, he was injured off a boarding hit from Sharks forward Jamie McGinn. Rome was sidelined from the rest of the game; McGinn received a five-minute <b>penalty</b> <b>on</b> the play, but did not receive further discipline from the league.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher {{started from}} pole {{position}} alongside McLaren driver David Coulthard. Barrichello began from third, alongside Coulthard's teammate Mika Häkkinen. The front two of Michael Schumacher and Coulthard battled {{for first place}} until Coulthard served a ten-second stop-go <b>penalty</b> <b>on</b> lap 14 as his mechanics worked on his car 15 seconds before the race began. Just before half distance, Michael Schumacher made an early pit stop allowing Barrichello {{to take the lead}} until his own pit stop on lap 43. By this time rain began to fall causing drivers to make the switch to wet-weather tyres. Michael Schumacher retained his lead throughout and took the victory 0.1 seconds ahead of Barrichello.|$|E

5|$|NC State went {{three and}} out after {{receiving}} the ball, and after Tech incurred a running into the kicker <b>penalty</b> <b>on</b> the first punt attempt, NC State punted the ball away. After the kick, Tech took over on offense at its 27-yard line. On Tech's first play after the punt, however, Hunter fumbled the ball after a 10-yard rush. NC State recovered the ball, and the Wolfpack offense returned to the field at the Tech 40-yard line. On their first play after the fumble recover, Kramer completed a 12-yard pass to Worthen for a first down. During the next play, Kramer fumbled the ball while attempting to run with it, and Virginia Tech's defense recovered. This allowed the Tech offense {{to return to the}} field and attempt another offensive drive beginning at their 27-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Receiving {{the ball}} at their own 8-yard line {{following}} a <b>penalty</b> <b>on</b> the kickoff return, Buffalo began to move down the field, with Drew Willy completing a 38-yard pass to wideout Brett Hamlin and a 29-yard pass to Naaman Roosevelt. On 3rd-and-4 from the Connecticut 19-yard line, Willy completed a ten-yard pass to James Starks, giving the Bulls a 1st-and-goal. Starks rushed for fouryards on firstdown; on seconddown, Willy threw an incomplete pass intended for Roosevelt. On 3rd-and-goal from the Husky 5-yard line, Willy attempted a pass that was deflected and intercepted by UConn safety Dahna Deleston, who returned the ball 100yards for the game-sealing touchdown. UConn won the game 38–20.|$|E
5|$|Running back Dwayne Thomas gained six {{yards on}} the first play, then earned a first down at the 30-yard line on an option play. After an {{incomplete}} pass, Druckenmiller completed a nine-yard throw to Still. Tech committed a false-start <b>penalty</b> <b>on</b> third down, but the Hokies made up the penalty and earned a first down when Druckenmiller completed a pass to Jennings at the Texas 45-yard line. On the first play after the completion, Druckenmiller was sacked for a one-yard loss. A second-down pass was dropped, a third-down pass was incomplete, and the Hokies punted again.|$|E
