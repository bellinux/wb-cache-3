40|$|Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) {{possesses}} methane monooxygenases (soluble - (sMMO) and particulate - (pMMO)) {{which are}} able to catalyse the epoxidation of propylene to propylene oxide. In a previous paper we {{have shown that the}} production of the epoxide caused a rapid inactivation of the bioconversion process (Stanley et al., 1992). This paper shows that cultures containing pMMO, inactivated by <b>propylene</b> oxide <b>production,</b> could be completely reactivated in the presence of growth substrates within 5 h after the removal of propylene oxide so long as the <b>propylene</b> oxide <b>production</b> rate was below 150 nmol min- 1 [mg dry weight cells]- 1. Reactivation under these conditions was detectable within 30 min of propylene oxide removal. On the other hand, cells inactivated by <b>propylene</b> oxide <b>production</b> rates in excess of 150 nmol min- 1 [mg dry weight]- 1 did not begin to recover activity within the 30 min period. Furthermore a lag period was observed before reactivation began which was dependent upon the initial production rate. Cultures possessing sMMO took twice as long to recover their activity compared with cells containing pMMO. Reactivation of <b>propylene</b> oxide <b>production</b> could occur without growth, but the process required the presence of a carbon and energy source (methane or methanol), sulphur, nitrogen and oxygen, although copper (which is normally involved in pMMO activity) was not required. It was shown that de novo protein synthesis was required for reactivation of activity. Production rates of 12 g l- 1 d- 1 could be maintained for longer than three weeks in a single phase production process and rates up to 30 g l- 1 d- 1 were achieved in a two stage process. Using Methylocystis parvus (OBBP) rates of up to 90 g l- 1 d- 1 were attained over a one week period...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: A {{previous}} study reported a fivefold increase in mortality from pancreatic cancer and a threefold increase in lymphopoietic and haematopoietic cancer among 278 {{men who were}} assigned to a now dismantled Union Carbide chlorohydrin unit in the Kanawha Valley of West Virginia. There were also significant trends with duration of employment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether a comparable increased risk in mortality from pancreatic cancer and lymphopoietic and haematopoietic cancer occurred among male employees assigned to the Dow Chemical Company's ethylene and <b>propylene</b> chlorohydrin <b>production</b> processes. METHODS: The cohort consisted of 1361 male employees who worked at the company's Freeport, Texas, Plaquemine, Louisiana or Midland, Michigan plants. Subjects were considered to have had a minimum of 30 days of workplace experience in 1940 - 92, in the ethylene chlorohydrin and propylene chlorohydrin process areas. These process areas were located within the ethylene oxide and <b>propylene</b> oxide <b>production</b> plants. A total of 300 deaths was observed to 31 December 1992. RESULTS: The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) for all malignant neoplasms was 94 (95 % CI 74 to 118). There was one pancreatic cancer death compared with 4. 0 expected (SMR 25, 95 % CI 1 to 140). There were 10 lymphopoietic and haematopoietic cancer deaths compared with 7. 7 expected (SMR 129, 95 % CI 62 to 238). Additional analyses, which examined location, production process, duration of employment, and a 25 year induction latency period, were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide some assurance that the Dow Chemical cohort, to date, has not experienced increased risks of pancreatic cancer and lymphopoietic and haematopoietic cancer as previously reported in a different cohort of chlorohydrin workers.

30|$|Generally, various {{reactions}} such as catalytic cracking, thermal cracking, hydrogen transfer, isomerization and condensation reactions {{occur in}} the FCC reactor.

30|$|Feedstocks {{that are}} high in {{aromatics}} have low hydrogen content and therefore are resistant to conversion at typical FCC residence times. The production of propylene requires {{a disproportionate share of}} the hydrogen and co-products, including propane, and dry gas requires an even greater share of hydrogen. Therefore, the amount of hydrogen available from the feedstock can limit the potential to produce propylene. Subsequently, <b>propylene</b> <b>production</b> is highly dependent on feed properties.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{epoxidation}} of propylene with hydrogen peroxide {{in the presence}} of acids and halides is studied. The presence of acids and halides is indispensable for increasing the selectivity of the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide, the first step of the direct <b>propylene</b> oxide <b>production</b> from hydrogen, oxygen and propylene. Therefore, we focus on the systematic study of the effect of these compounds on the epoxidation of propylene with hydrogen peroxide in prospective of its future integration with hydrogen peroxide in-situ formed. Indeed, the epoxidation of propylene with hydrogen peroxide is the second step of the direct PO synthesis from hydrogen, oxygen and propylene. The acid concentration and type were shown to {{have an effect on the}} PO selectivity. Sulphuric and hydrochloric acids, typical compounds used to stabilize the hydrogen peroxide, are not suitable for the direct propylene oxide due to their fast dissociation in the solution. This leads to a fast ring opening reaction of the epoxide. Phosphoric acid was shown to have a much milder effect on the propylene oxide selectivity, therefore being an option for the direct propylene oxide synthesis. Also, the amount of halides (NaBr) needed to stabilize the hydrogen peroxide, does not have an effect on the epoxidation step. Therefore phosphoric acid and NaBr can be implemented in the direct propylene oxide synthesis from hydrogen, oxygen and propylene...|$|R

This strain, a gram-positive methylotrophic bacterium identified as Mycobacterium austroafricanum IFP 2012, was also able to degrade tert-amyl methyl ether and tert-amyl alcohol. Ethyl tert-butyl ether was weakly degraded. tert-Butyl formate and 2 -hydroxy isobutyrate (HIBA), two intermediates in the MTBE catabolism pathway, were detected during growth on MTBE. A positive effect of Co 2 + during growth of M. austroafricanum IFP 2012 on HIBA was demonstrated. The specific rate of MTBE degradation was 0. 6 mmol/h/g (dry weight) of cells, and the biomass yield on MTBE was 0. 44 g (dry weight) per g of MTBE. MTBE, TBA, and HIBA degradation activities were induced by MTBE and TBA, and TBA was a good inducer.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} {{design of the}} catalytic oxidative cracking (COC) of hexane as a model compound of naphtha is reported. The design is based on experimental data which are elaborated through a structural design method to a process flow sheet. The potential of COC {{as an alternative to}} steam cracking (SC) is discussed through comparing the key differences between the two processes. The presence of Li/MgO catalyst in the COC process (i) induces hexane cracking at lower operation temperatures (575 °C) than in SC (800 °C) and (ii) controls the olefin distribution by increasing the ratio of (butylene[*]+[*]propylene) /ethylene. The product distribution, and thus the separation train of both processes, is different. Catalytic oxidative cracking is designed to maximize <b>propylene</b> and butylene <b>production,</b> while steam cracking is designed to maximize ethylene production. In comparison to SC, the COC process is more energy efficient and consumes 53 % less total duty for a production capacity of 300 kton/year of light olefins. However, a preliminary economic evaluation illustrates that the loss of valuable feedstock as a result of combustion of part of the naphtha feed makes the COC process economically less attractive than SC...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{is one of}} {{the main}} gases which cause the {{greenhouse}} effect. As a way to attenuate this damage, CO 2 could be used as a building block for copolymerization reactions; precisely as C 1 feedstock (monomer of the reaction) and as the pressurizing gas in these copolymerization reactions. The required monomer which is involved in the reactions is propylene oxide (PO) which possesses a high reactivity, enabling the CO 2 bonding. Through the mechanism of ring opening polymerization (ROP), the incorporation of CO 2 in the polymer chain can be possible. During this research, two different heterogeneous catalysts were used for the copolymerization reactions. Zinc glutarate (ZnGA) and double metal cyanide (DMC) were selected as plausible catalysts to perform the reactions. The goal of this doctoral thesis is to study these heterogeneous catalysts in copolymerization reactions between PO and CO 2 to understand how the catalyst and the process can be improved for a possible future industrial application. To characterize the catalysts, several techniques were used such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR and FTIR with pyridine), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP), light scattering (with air and distilled water), nitrogen physisorption, scanning electron microscopy and energy–dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), thermogravimetric analysis-mass spectrometry (TGA-MS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). The goal of these copolymerization reactions was to obtain a liquid CO 2 /propylene oxide copolymer, understanding the formation of carbonate bonds (polypropylene carbonate, PPC) and trying to minimize the cyclic <b>propylene</b> carbonate <b>production</b> (by-product, PC). Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) techniques were used to analyse the copolymers obtained from these reactions. The first catalyst used for the study was zinc glutarate (ZnGA), as it is shown in Chapter 1. An exhaustive characterization of this heterogeneous catalyst was carried out with a complete study of its behaviour in copolymerization reactions. This catalyst was synthesized by mixing zinc oxide, glutaric acid and toluene. ZnGA proved to be a catalyst without any porosity and without Brønsted and/or Lewis acid sites. The active area was the outer surface area of the catalyst, where the Zn 2 + active sites exist. In this catalyst, the average amount of Zn 2 + amount was around 353 mg Zn / g catalyst. The sample was very disperse on particle sizes, showing also a rectangular plate shape morphology with an average size of 321. 6 nm. Several different reaction conditions were screened for the formation of the copolymers from propylene oxide (PO), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and polypropylene glycol (as initiator, PPG of 425 g/mol). The study included changes in the amount of ZnGA (0. 3, 0. 6, 1. 0, 1. 5 g), reaction temperature (60, 80 ºC), reaction pressure (6, 25 barg), final expected molecular weight of the copolymer (725, 3000 g/mol) and the reaction time (20, 40 h). Finally, it was possible to conclude that the best conditions corresponded to 1. 5 g of catalyst, 25 barg, 80 ºC, 40 h and 3000 Da of initial PO estimation. TON (Turnover number) and TOF (Turnover frequency) values are really low which demonstrated the low activity of this catalyst. A completely different behavior was observed when a double metal cyanide catalyst (DMC) was used. In Chapters 2 and 3 several DMC catalysts were synthesized and characterized in order to determine which one is the most active. Chapter 2 showed the effect of varying the initial amounts of zinc chloride (ZnCl 2) on the catalytic activity, in order to determine the influence of the catalyst preparation method. Five different DMC catalysts were synthesized from zinc chloride (ZnCl 2), potassium hexacyanocobaltate (III) (K 3 [Co(CN) 6] 2), tert-butanol (tBuOH, as complexing agent (CA)) and polyethylene glycol 1000 (PEG 1000, as co-complexing agent (co-CA)). The Zn/Co ratio was changed during the synthesis, having one reagent always in excess to reveal its impact on the catalytic activity, crystallinity and other properties. The presence of K+ caused a dramatic decrease on the catalyst activity, while an increase of Zn 2 + produced more agglomerations of spherical particles in the catalyst (DMC E). Only two of the catalysts prepared were successfully activated (D and E catalysts, according the nomenclature used in this thesis). Their morphologies were lamellar with spherical particle agglomerations. After the copolymerization reactions, all the copolymers were analysed revealing that the most active catalyst was DMC E. With DMC E it was possible to achieve a high catalytic activity (2. 5 kg polymer / g catalyst) with an increased CO 2 incorporation (6. 7 %) and a lower production of the cyclic propylene carbonate, PC (0. 3 %). The implementation of mechanical stirrer instead of the initial magnetic one, decreased the polydispersity index (PDI) values from 5. 97 and 13. 09 to values around 1 to 1. 1. The results showed that it is possible to obtain shorter dispersed copolymer chains in the bulk reaction medium. Chapter 3 was focused on the catalyst activation stage previous to the copolymerization reaction process. This catalyst was named as DMC A and it was exactly the same as the DMC E discussed in Chapter 2. This catalyst had only 0. 0002 mol/ g cat of K+ while the amount of Zn was 0. 0036 mol/ g catalyst. 12 experiments were carried out for this DMC catalyst activation study, modifying the amount of catalyst using 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg of DMC and 4, 8 and 18 g of propylene oxide in total. This kind of catalyst is not a selective one and, after the reaction, high concentrations of the by-product were obtained. As the amount of DMC was increased, the PC amount also increased with the same CO 2 incorporation in the final copolymer. Using only 20 mg of catalyst per batch, the reaction produced more polypropylene carbonate (PPC) and cyclic propylene carbonate (PC) with the highest values of TON and TOF and the lowest PDI value. These results were confirmed by the FTIR spectrum for 20 mg of DMC A catalyst. Apart from these chapters, the current PhD thesis has also an appendix. The appendix shows the solubility of CO 2 in different polycarbonates. Several experiments at different temperatures, trying to charge the same initial pressure, were conducted to determine how the solubility is influenced by temperature and pressure...|$|R
40|$|Biodiesel is an {{attractive}} alternative fuel obtained from renewable resources and glycerol is produced as a major byproduct in the biodiesel industry. Upgrading glycerol to other valuable chemicals will contribute to an economic sustainability of the biodiesel industry. Valuable commodity chemicals such as 1, 2 -propanediol (1, 2 -PD), 1, 3 -Propanediol (1, 3 -PD) and 1 -Propanol (1 -PO) could be produced by catalytic hydrogenolysis. Although much {{work has been done}} towards the conversion of glycerol to 1, 2 -PD and 1, 3 -PD, the direct conversion of glycerol to 1 -PO has not received much attention. From an industry point of view, the production of 1 -PO is very interesting. 1 -PO has potential applications as a solvent, organic intermediate and can be dehydrated to produce “green“ <b>propylene</b> for the <b>production</b> of polypropylene. Therefore, {{the development of a new}} process for the efficient conversion of glycerol to 1 -PO will contribute to new “green” chemicals which will benefit the environment and make biodiesel processes more profitable as 1 kg of glycerol is produced for every 10 kg of biodiesel. In this research, heterogeneous hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1 -PO was carried out in a batch reactor using a bi-functional catalyst (prepared by a sequential impregnation method) in water, a green and inexpensive liquid medium. It was found that a bi-functional solid catalyst consists of a non-noble metal Ni for hydrogenation and an acidic function of silicotungstic acid (HSiW) supported on alumina (Al 2 O 3) to be an active catalyst for the one-pot synthesis of 1 -PO from glycerol and H 2 in a liquid phase reaction. A systematic study has been carried out to assess the effects of operating conditions on the glycerol conversion. The catalysts were characterized using BET, XRD, NH 3 -TPD, TPR, TGA and FTIR techniques. The effect of different metals (Cu, Ni, Pd, Pt and Cs) supported 30 HSiW/Al 2 O 3 catalyst, heteroatom substitution (HSiW, HPW and HPMo) on NiHPA/Al 2 O 3 catalysts and 10 Ni/ 30 HSiW supported on different supports (Al 2 O 3, TiO 2 and MCM- 41) were studied to determine to what extent these components affect the catalytic activity of the NiHPAs/Al 2 O 3 catalysts for the hydrogenolysis of glycerol. The effect of the preparation process on the catalytic activity and the structure of the catalyst was also studied. It was found that 1 %Pt is the best promoter for the production of 1 -PO in a stainless steel batch reactor (the selectivity to 1 -PO was 59. 2 % at 45. 3 % conversion of glycerol). 1 %Ni, a much cheaper metal, has fairly comparable reactivity to 1 %Pt (the selectivity to 1 -PO was 54. 7 % at 39. 2 % converison of glycerol). It was reported that the catalytic activity and thermal stability towards decomposition of the catalyst dependends on heteroatom substitution. Using NH 3 -TPD, XRD and FTIR it was found that while the Keggin-structure of HSiW and HPW supported catalyst is stable up to a treatment temperature of 450 oC, the Keggin-structure of a HPMo supported catalyst was decomposed even at a treatment temperature of 350 oC; the decomposition of HPMo into MoO 3 is likely to be responsible for the inactivity of the NiHPMo catalyst for glycerol conversion. HPW and HPMo lost their acidity much more readily than HSiW, and a HSiW supported catalyst was the best candidate for 1 -PO production. The catalytic activity and the acidity of 10 Ni/ 30 HSiW supported catalyst are influenced strongly by supporting 10 Ni/ 30 HSiW on different supports. Using XRD and FTIR it was found that the thermal treatment during the preparation process indeed affected the structure and the activity of the catalyst to some extent. The loss in activity of the catalyst, the decomposition in Keggin-structure of HPAs occur if the treatment temperature is higher than 450 oC. It is important to note that this is the first report on a 10 Ni/ 30 HSiW suported catalyst developed for the one-pot hydrogenolysis of glycerol in a water media with high conversion of glycerol (90. 1 %) and high selectivity to 1 -PO (92. 9 %) at 240 oC and 580 PSI hydrogen using a Hastelloy batch reactor. The activation energy Ea of this reaction is 124. 1 kJ/mol. Reaction pathways for the hydrogenolysis of glycerol using a bifunctional catalyst 10 Ni/ 30 HSiW/Al 2 O 3 is proposed. It is believed that acidity plays an important role for the dehydration and Ni plays an important role for the hydrogenation. It is suggested that with acidic catalysts, the main route for the formation of 1 -PO from glycerol is via either the hydrogenation of acrolein or further hydrogenolysis of 1, 2 -PD (and 1, 3 PD) where 1, 2 -PD (and 1, 3 -PD) and acrolein are the intermediate species in the formation of 1 -PO from glycerol. The formation of 1, 2 -PD and 1, 3 -PD takes place through an initial dehydration of the primary or secondary hydroxyl groups on glycerol to give acetol or 3 - hydroxylpropanaldehyde (3 -HPA). The hydrogen activated on the metal facilitates the hydrogenation of acetol or 3 -HPA to release 1, 2 -PD or 1, 3 -PD respectively. However, dehydration of 3 -HPA on the acid sites forms acrolein. Further hydrogenolysis of diols or hydrogenation of acrolein produces 1 -PO. 1, 3 -PD that is a very high value-added chemical can also be obtained from hydrogenolysis of glycerol using a Ni-HSiW supported catalyst. To improve the selectivity of 1, 3 -PD it is suggested that the catalyst should have high hydrogenation activity for the intermediate 3 -HPA. The equilibrium between acrolein and 3 -HPA in the hydration-dehydration step is important, so it is essential to tune the bi-functional catalyst and the conditions of the reaction to form 1, 3 -PD from 3 -HPA. A study of promoter effects for the activity of catalyst to form 1, 3 -PD is recommended...|$|R
30|$|Naphtha is the {{predominant}} feed for steam crackers, {{as more than}} half of the ethylene currently produced worldwide is derived from cracking naphtha feed. However, <b>propylene</b> <b>production</b> from steam crackers depends on the operating rates of the steam cracker and the type of feedstock. The propylene yield from steam cracking is directly proportional to the average molecular weight of the feed [19].|$|E
30|$|The {{objective}} of the present review is to evaluate the processing of hydrocarbon feedstocks to produce propylene and summarize the effects of existing FCC technology, operation variables and catalysts on product quality and quantity. These three main factors form {{what is called the}} constraint triangle for maximizing <b>propylene</b> <b>production</b> as described by Maadhah [65]. The effect of each factor is discussed and supported by experimental results in the literature.|$|E
30|$|Zeolites have {{received}} much attention for chemical industry and academia owing to their high thermal stability, shape selectivity and high catalytic activity. ZSM- 5, {{a member of}} the zeolite family with high-silica content has been widely employed in petrochemical catalytic processes, oil refining and environmental protection fields, such as cracking, isomerization, aromatization and alkylation processes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Propylene is currently producing from the steam cracking (SC) of light naphtha. However, this process is inefficient to meet the requirements of propylene in the market. Among various alternative sources for <b>propylene</b> <b>production,</b> FCC units are considered as the most promising and largest one [7]. More than 30  % of the worldwide <b>propylene</b> <b>production</b> is from FCC units and this figure will continue to increase [8]. To enhance the propylene yield of FCC units, ZSM- 5 zeolite has been used as an additive in industrial practice since its first commercial use in 1983 [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Because of its unique pore structure, ZSM- 5 zeolite can crack selectively gasoline-range linear or mono-branched hydrocarbons to C 3 -C 4 olefins. And its moderate acidity can largely suppress hydrogen-transfer reactions [10].|$|E
30|$|The {{cracking}} reactions can {{be categorized}} into two types, namely catalytic cracking and thermal cracking. Catalytic cracking is endothermic, occurs {{on the surface of}} the catalyst and yields high C 3 and C 4 olefins. So, the reaction temperature and acidic properties of the catalyst play a major role in the activity and selectivity of the reaction. The thermal cracking reaction is also endothermic and follows the free radical mechanism which generates ethylene and dry gas. For increasing <b>propylene</b> <b>production,</b> the reaction conditions have to be optimized to minimize thermal cracking.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{recent advances}} in the <b>propylene</b> <b>production</b> with emp-hasis on the following major commercial routes: ethylene steam cracker plants, refine-ry fluid catalytic cracking, olefin metathesis, propane dehydrogenation and methanol. About 68 % of world propylene os produced as co-product to ethylene by the steam cracking of hydrocarbons and about 29 % is produced as co-product to gasoline in the fluid cataly-tic cracking (FCC) of gas oils. The remaining 3 % is produced via olefin metathesis and propane dehydrogenation. Other emerging technologies include catalytic cracking of higher hydrocarbons and methanol conver-sion...|$|E
30|$|The {{boundaries}} for {{the mass}} flow rates of gas oil and catalyst are chosen such that it reflects the typical industrial FCC unit limits for C/O ratios of 4 : 1 – 10 : 1 by weight [48], Sadeghbeigi [49], [9]. C/O ratios for <b>propylene</b> <b>production</b> in high severity units and riser-downer are higher [18] than the C/O ratios used in conventional FCC units, which vary between 1 and 6 [16, 29, 50] and 3 – 25. Hence, the boundaries {{for the mass}} flow rates are open wide enough to accommodate low and high C/O ratios (1 – 25) on the optimization framework.|$|E
