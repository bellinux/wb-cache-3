40|$|Purpose: Increasing students’ <b>political</b> <b>interest</b> {{has been}} a longstanding goal of civic education. One way to trigger students’ <b>interests</b> in <b>political</b> issues is by {{engaging}} them first in an attention grabbing activity (i. e., assigning them to roles). Because {{it is important to}} examine not only how roles may trigger <b>political</b> <b>interest,</b> but also students’ <b>political</b> <b>interest</b> afterwards, we asked: What happens to students’ <b>interest</b> in <b>political</b> issues after engagement first? Methodology: Drawing from Schwartz and Bransford’s (1998) ‘A Time for Telling’, we conducted a case study of three students, who experienced ‘engagement first’ activities in a class, and report on their <b>interests</b> about <b>political</b> issues in one particular activity. Findings: While role-play can help trigger students’ <b>political</b> <b>interest.</b> Our findings show that for students to maintain <b>political</b> <b>interest,</b> they need follow-up opportunities to engage in meaningful activities around politics. Research implications: Role assignment {{is a good way to}} trigger <b>political</b> <b>interest,</b> but productive disciplinary engagement can be coupled with engagement first to extent students’ <b>political</b> <b>interest.</b> Practical implications: Classroom activities that hope to support students’ <b>political</b> <b>interest</b> may need to include both ‘engagement first’ and further scaffolds for students to engage productively with politics...|$|R

Measures included trust in people, trust in institutions, <b>political</b> <b>interest,</b> life satisfaction and self-perceived health. Mediation path analysis and structural equation modelling were used to test the mediation effects of <b>political</b> <b>interest</b> on the relationship between trust in people and trust in institutions with life satisfaction and self-perceived health.

Through a 4 -weeklong experiment, this study tests the effects of exposure to The Daily Show with Jon Stewart on <b>political</b> <b>interest</b> and <b>political</b> knowledge in a sample of community college students in mid-Michigan. Changes in attitudes and knowledge levels are analyzed through a pre and posttest, comparing the group who watched The Daily Show to groups who watched NBC Nightly News, Entertainment Tonight, and a no-exposure control group. Measuring <b>political</b> <b>interest</b> with a 40 -point composite index, results from ANOVA and ANCOVA models find a statistically significant difference in change in <b>political</b> <b>interest</b> between the <b>political</b> comedy treatment group and the no-exposure control group. Results testing political comedy’s effects on political knowledge indicate that network news has a more direct effect on learning of current political events, while <b>political</b> <b>interest</b> impacts learning through the mediating variable of <b>political</b> <b>interest.</b> The difference in political knowledge change between the political comedy and network news treatments was indistinguishable from zero.

Glamorgan was also politically split between factions in the west and the east of the county, with most of Bute's estates in the eastern half.

40|$|Decades of {{behavior}} research {{have shown that}} <b>political</b> <b>interest</b> {{is the most important}} predictor of political knowledge and citizen participation. <b>Political</b> <b>interest</b> and knowledge, in turn, are at the core of democratic citizenship and the quality of representative democracy. An under-appreciated fact about <b>political</b> <b>interest,</b> however, is that typical levels of <b>political</b> <b>interest</b> (and thus <b>political</b> knowledge) vary dramatically across countries. Current theories of <b>political</b> <b>interest</b> and knowledge, however, explain little about why such differences occur and persist. This dissertation attempts to fill that void by proposing a novel theoretical framework for why individuals do or do not become interested in politics. This new theory leads directly to hypotheses about how typical levels of <b>political</b> <b>interest</b> can vary across different political contexts. The individual level theory draws on appraisal models of interest in psychology. These models show that appraising an event or a message as "comprehensible" (or, more generally, as being able to cope with it) is one of several necessary conditions for individuals to be interested in the event or message (e. g., Silvia 2006). Drawing on a large body of work in political psychology which highlights the critical role heuristics play in helping individuals comprehend politics, I extend the appraisal model of interest to include a role for heuristics in enhancing comprehensibility and therefore interest. Adding heuristics to the appraisal model of interest is the key to understanding cross-national variation in typical levels of <b>political</b> <b>interest.</b> Specifically, I argue that a specific set of simplifying heuristics that work to make politics more "comprehensible" is the main driver of the temporal and cross-national differences in <b>political</b> <b>interest.</b> The micro-foundations of the argument are examined by implementing a unique experimental design that manipulates the availability of heuristics for different groups. The experimental results support the proposed mechanism, demonstrating that individuals in contexts where heuristics are available and useful are more interested in experimental tasks. To validate the main argument for the cross-national differences in <b>political</b> <b>interest,</b> I introduce a set of measurements tapping into the political contexts associated with the availability and usefulness of common political heuristics, and test the argument using a comprehensive dataset combining a large pool of cross-national surveys and various contextual measures...|$|R

The existence of slavery in Cuba, the island's plantation economy based on sugar, and its geographical location predisposed it to Southern influence; its admission would greatly strengthen the position of Southern slaveholders, whose way of life was under fire from Northern abolitionists.

As slavery-free Western states were admitted, Southern politicians increasingly looked to Cuba as the next slave state.

Under Brezhnev, private plots yielded 30% of the national agricultural production when they only cultivated 4% of the land. This was seen by some as proof that de-collectivisation was necessary to prevent Soviet agriculture from collapsing, but leading Soviet politicians shrank from supporting such drastic measures due to ideological and <b>political</b> <b>interests.</b> The underlying problems were the growing shortage of skilled workers, a wrecked rural culture, the payment of workers in proportion to the quantity rather than the quality of their work, and too large farm machinery for the small collective farms and the roadless countryside. In the face of this, Brezhnev's only options were schemes such as large land reclamation and irrigation projects, or of course, radical reform.|$|E

This was not to be, however, and after a few months Reitz left Bloemfontein to set up as a diamond prospector in Griqualand West, where he bought a small claim near Pniel from the Berlin Missionary Society. This enterprise also proved unsuccessful, and again after only a few months Reitz returned to Cape Town. This time, his Cape Town law practice was successful, ironically because of the British annexation of the Orange Free State diamondfields (1871) and the economic prosperity this emanated for the Cape Colony.|$|E
