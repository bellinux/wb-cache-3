His solution was to design a boat in which all components would double as items of clothing, or accessories that Halkett assumed the user would be carrying in any event.|$|E
5|$|Early {{approaches}} to preserving food used variants of traditional cold boxes {{to solve the}} <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> take small quantities of products short distances to market. Thomas Moore, an engineer from Maryland, invented an early refrigerator which he patented in 1803; this involved a large, insulated wooden box, with a tin container of ice embedded in the top. This refrigerator primarily relied upon simple insulation, rather than ventilation, but the design was widely adopted by farmers and small traders, and illegal copies abounded. By the 1830s portable refrigerator chests became used in the meat trade, {{taking advantage of the}} growing supplies of ice to use ventilation to better preserve the food. By the 1840s, improved supplies and an understanding of the importance of circulating air was making a significant improvement to refrigeration in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|In {{some ancient}} atlases, the constellations Serpens and Ophiuchus were {{depicted}} as two separate constellations, although more often they were shown {{as a single}} constellation. One notable figure to depict Serpens separately was Johann Bayer; thus, Serpens' stars are cataloged with separate Bayer designations from those of Ophiuchus. When Eugène Delporte established modern constellation boundaries in the 1920s, he elected to depict the two separately. However, this posed the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> disentangle the two constellations, with Deporte deciding to split Serpens into two areas—the head and the tail—separated by the continuous Ophiuchus. These two areas became known as Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda, caput being the Latin word for head and cauda the Latin word for tail.|$|E

25|$|Another {{architectural}} breakthrough at Chartres was {{a resolution}} to the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> arrange attached columns or shafts around a pier {{in a way that}} worked aesthetically – but which also satisfied the desire for structural logic that characterised French high gothic. The nave at Chartres features alternating round and octagonal solid cored piers, each of which has four attached half-columns at the cardinal points, two of which (on the east-west axis) support the arches of the arcade, one acts as the springing for the aisle vault and one supports the cluster of shafts that rise through the triforium and clerestory to support the high-vault ribs. This pier design, known as pilier cantonné was to prove highly influential and subsequently featured {{in a number of other}} high gothic churches.|$|E
25|$|Resnais's {{first feature}} film was Hiroshima mon amour (1959). It {{originated}} as a commission from {{the producers of}} Nuit et Brouillard (Anatole Dauman and Argos Films) to make a documentary about the atomic bomb, but Resnais initially declined, thinking {{that it would be}} too similar to the earlier film about the concentration camps and that it presented the same <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> film incomprehensible suffering. However, in discussion with the novelist Marguerite Duras a fusion of fiction and documentary was developed which acknowledged the impossibility of speaking about Hiroshima; one could only speak about the impossibility of speaking about Hiroshima. In the film, the themes of memory and forgetting are explored via new narrative techniques which balance images with narrated text and ignore conventional notions of plot and story development. The film was shown at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival, alongside Truffaut's Les Quatre Cents Coups (The 400 Blows), and its success became associated with the emerging movement of the French New Wave.|$|E

500|$|As AGF commander, McNair {{worked to}} solve the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> {{integrate}} replacement soldiers into units that had sustained casualties. [...] Rather than adopt the model of replacing units that had sustained high casualties with new, full strength units, Marshall and McNair cited the need to allocate space on transport ships to equipment and supplies as the reason to provide individual replacement soldiers to units while the units remained in combat. [...] In practice, the individual replacement system caused difficulties for both the replacement soldiers and the units they joined, especially during later stages of the war. [...] New soldiers could have difficulty being accepted by the veterans of their units, since they were replacing buddies {{who had been killed}} or wounded, and had not shared the veterans' combat experiences. In addition, because new soldiers joined units that were already in the fight, there was often no time to teach them the tactics and techniques that increased their chances of surviving on the battlefield.|$|E

As a result, Akagi and Kaga were given different exhaust systems to evaluate in real-world conditions. Kagas funnel gases were collected {{in a pair of}} long horizontal ducts which discharged at the rear of each side of the flight deck, in spite of predictions by a number of prominent naval architects that they would not keep the hot gases away from the flight deck. The predictions proved to be correct, not least because Kaga was slower than the Akagi which allowed the gases to rise and interfere with landing operations. Another drawback was that the heat of the gases made the crew's quarters located {{on the side of the}} ship by the funnels almost uninhabitable.|$|E
500|$|The pair had to {{overcome}} the challenge of how to represent [...] Thai speech and music. [...] Rodgers, who had experimented with Asian music in his short-lived 1928 musical with Lorenz Hart titled Chee-chee, {{did not wish to}} use actual Thai music, which American audiences might not find accessible. [...] Instead, he gave his music an exotic flavor, using open fifths and chords in unusual keys, in ways pleasant to Western ears. Hammerstein faced the <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> represent Thai speech; he and Rodgers chose to convey it by musical sounds, made by the orchestra. [...] For the King's style of speech, Hammerstein developed an abrupt, emphatic way of talking, which was mostly free of articles, as are many East Asian languages. [...] The forceful style reflected the King's personality and was maintained even when he sang, especially in his one solo, [...] "A Puzzlement". [...] Many of the King's lines, including his first utterance, [...] "Who? Who? Who?", and much of the initial scene between him and Anna, are drawn from Landon's version. [...] Nevertheless, the King is presented more sympathetically in the musical than in the novel or the 1946 film, as the musical omits the torture and burning at the stake of Lady Tuptim and her partner.|$|E
