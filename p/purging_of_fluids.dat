5000|$|If insects have access, maggots {{hatch and}} begin to feed on the body's tissues. [...] Maggot activity, {{typically}} confined to natural orifices, and masses under the skin, causes the skin to slip, and hair to detach from the skin. [...] Maggot feeding, and the accumulation of gases within the body, eventually leads to post-mortem skin ruptures which will then further allow <b>purging</b> <b>of</b> gases and <b>fluids</b> into the surrounding environment. [...] Ruptures in the skin allow oxygen to re-enter the body and provide more surface area {{for the development of}} fly larvae and the activity of aerobic microorganisms. [...] The <b>purging</b> <b>of</b> gases and <b>fluids</b> results in the strong distinctive odors associated with decay.|$|R
5000|$|Active decay is {{characterized}} by the period of greatest mass loss. This loss occurs as a result of both the voracious feeding of maggots and the <b>purging</b> <b>of</b> decomposition <b>fluids</b> into the surrounding environment. [...] The purged fluids accumulate around the body and create a cadaver decomposition island (CDI). Liquefaction of tissues and disintegration become apparent during this time and strong odors persist. [...] The end of active decay is signaled by the migration of maggots away from the body to pupate.|$|R
50|$|In {{forensic}} investigation, {{the time}} of occurrence of an event (such as time of death, time of incident) {{is one of the}} most important things to determine accurately as soon as possible. Sometimes this can only be estimated. Some indicators that investigators use are rigor mortis, livor mortis, algor mortis, clouding of the corneas, state of decomposition, presence/absence <b>of</b> <b>purged</b> <b>fluids</b> and level <b>of</b> tissue desiccation.|$|R
40|$|Diogenes {{syndrome}} is a syndrome {{described in the}} clinical literature in elderly individuals characterized by social isolation and extreme squalor. A number of typical features {{are found in the}} forensic evaluation of these deaths as the cases usually initiate medicolegal investigations due to the circumstances and the lack of recorded medical histories. Examinations of the death scenes are often difficult as victim's houses {{are in a state of}} disrepair, with filth and clutter, and pet dogs may resent the intrusion of strangers. Bodies are often filthy, with parasitic infestations, and are often putrefied due to the social isolation of the deceased and the delay in the finding of the corpse. Bodies may be traumatized from postmortem animal depredation by rodents or pets (eg, cats, dogs), and injuries such as bruises and lacerations may be present from falls associated with terminal illnesses or alcoholism. Blood or putrefactive fluids may be spread throughout the house by pets. Treatable medical conditions are often present in advanced stages, and features of hypothermia may be found. Attending police may suspect robbery due to disarray of the house and homicide due to apparent “bleeding” around the body from <b>purging</b> <b>of</b> putrefactive <b>fluids,</b> injuries from falls, or postmortem animal activity and “blood stains” throughout the house from antemortem injuries and/or fluid spread by animals. Finally, the identification of the deceased may be compromised by decay and/or postmortem animal activity. Thus, in addition to having typical clinical manifestations, such individuals appear to form a distinct subset of forensic cases having characteristic death scene and autopsy features and presenting particular difficulties in postmortem evaluations...|$|R
