Areas of special interest for the cultivated plant taxonomist include: searching for and recording new plants suitable for cultivation (plant hunting); communicating with and advising the general public on matters concerning the classification and nomenclature of cultivated plants and carrying out original research on these topics; describing the cultivated plants of particular regions (horticultural floras); maintaining databases, herbaria and other information about cultivated plants.|$|E

As a result, the vessel spent several years in out-of-water storage, with the exception of infill trips for Washington State Ferries routes and periodic test runs. During one of the infill trips, the ferry ran aground near Port Hadlock in January 2013, and was later damaged by a small fire while in storage in Port Townsend.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} of reopening the Bergen Street lower level was {{looked at as}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> for the reintroduction of F express service as it could reduce the impact of less local service at the busy station. The station, if reopened, would require significant and expensive reconstruction, including making the station ADA accessible, the reconstruction of platform stairs, improved lighting and communications, waterproofing and concrete repairs, among other things. The rehabilitation would cost $75 million, and therefore the lower level is not currently planned to be reopened.|$|E

5|$|M. nigrocincta ants have highly venomous stings {{which are}} painful and produce intense burning sensations. The sensations last for many {{days and the}} sting itches. If left untreated, the sting may develop into an ulcer. The venom of a closely related species, M. pilosula is amongst the strongest of the Formicidae and {{contains}} active ingredients such as acid and alkaline phosphatases, hyaluronidase, as well as phospholipases A2 and B. In a 2011 Australian ant allergy venom study, the objective of which was to determine what native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis, it was shown that 265 of the 376 participants taking <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> reacted to the sting of several Myrmecia species. Of these, 176 reacted to the M. pilosula, 15 to M. nigrocincta, three to M. ludlowi, and 56 to other Myrmecia ants. The study concluded that four main groups of Australian ants were responsible for causing anaphylaxis. Besides Myrmecia species, these included the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica).|$|E

25|$|In Banach spaces, a large <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> {{involves}} the dual space: {{the space of}} all continuous linear maps from the space into its underlying field, so-called functionals. A Banach space can be canonically identified with a subspace of its bidual, which is the dual of its dual space. The corresponding map is an isometry but in general not onto. A general Banach space and its bidual need not even be isometrically isomorphic in any way, contrary to the finite-dimensional situation. This is explained in the dual space article.|$|E
25|$|Selection bias {{occurs when}} study {{subjects}} are selected or become <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> {{as a result}} of a third, unmeasured variable which is associated with both the exposure and outcome of interest. For instance, it has repeatedly been noted that cigarette smokers and non smokers tend to differ in their study participation rates. (Sackett D cites the example of Seltzer et al., in which 85% of non smokers and 67% of smokers returned mailed questionnaires.) It is important to note that such a difference in response will not lead to bias if it is not also associated with a systematic difference in outcome between the two response groups.|$|E

25|$|A small 2004 {{study by}} Ellen Paek empirically {{examined}} {{the extent to}} which religiosity, operationalized as religious orientation and religious behavior, is related to the controversial idea of emotional intelligence (EI). The study examined {{the extent to which}} religious orientation and behavior were related to self-reported EI in 148 church attending adult Christians. Non-religious individuals were not <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> The study found that the individuals' self-reported religious orientation was positively correlated with their perceiving themselves to have greater EI. While the number of religious group activities was positively associated with perceived EI, number of years of church attendance was unrelated. Significant positive correlations were also found between level of religious commitment and perceived EI. Thus, the Christian volunteers were more likely to consider themselves emotionally intelligent if they spent more time in group activities and had more commitment to their beliefs.|$|E

The 118-passenger, [...] vessel, named Rich Passage 1, was built in Bellingham by All American Marine and uses a lightweight composite body and hydrofoil to reduce weight and minimize wake. During the vessel's sea trials near Bellingham in 2010, it lost its hydrofoil during high-speed operation, setting the project back until a new hydrofoil was rebuilt in 2011. Testing in Kitsap County began in October 2011, and a passenger service trial was conducted in summer 2012. Rich Passage 1 performed 35-minute crossings between Bremerton and Seattle, traveling through Rich Passage at [...] {{and the rest of the}} route at [...] to reduce fuel consumption; the vessel reportedly created a wake [...] "half that" [...] from a larger automobile ferry and was found to have successfully operated without damaging beaches and bulkheads during full-speed tests. The passenger service did not attract expected ridership, blamed on the $7 fare without monthly passes, leading Kitsap Transit to consider a sales tax to subsidize service.|$|E

Many people have assumed that early-20th-century suburbs were enclaves for middle-class whites, a concept that carries tremendous cultural influence yet is actually stereotypical. Many suburbs are based on a heterogeneous society of working-class and minority residents, many of whom want to own their own house. Mary Corbin Sies argues that it is necessary to examine how [...] "suburb" [...] is defined as well as the distinction made between cities and suburbs, geography, economic circumstances, and the interaction of numerous factors that move research beyond acceptance of stereotyping and its influence on scholarly assumptions.|$|E

However, some scholars like Mark Bauerlein continue to argue that less capable theorists have abandoned proven methods of epistemology, resulting in persistent lapses in learning, research, and evaluation.
