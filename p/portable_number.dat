40|$|The {{topic of}} the Road Safety Audit is of sure {{interest}} for both engineers and road administrators. Everybody knows that road safety depends on the interaction of three factors: road, driver, and environment. Generally, the analyses of functionality all along the road network are aimed at measuring the safety performance by means of absolute and analytical quantities, e. g. Mean Texture Depth (MTD), British <b>Portable</b> <b>Number</b> (BPN) or International Roughness Index (IRI). The integration of these quantities is useful to estimate the state of maintenance and, with this, the state of functionality of road pavements, {{in comparison with the}} traditional Specifications, Regulations and Standards. As a consequence, descriptive indexes like the International Friction Index (IFI) can easily be determined, which provide information {{on the state of the}} pavement by means of a sole number. However, this approach to safety analysis could be wrong because it does not consider the “human factor”, measurable through driver behaviour. Several studies in recent years have demonstrated that drivers are inclined to profit by the pavement adhesion properties more than we might think (the vehicle “operating speed” is very often higher than the “design speed” supposed for that road element). The importance of this aspect consists of the risk of under-estimating the safety level related to the real operative conditions of the road. This paper discusses the relationships between theoretical design adhesion, operative required adhesion and instrumental measured adhesion so as to define a procedure to evaluate the operative safety coefficient of a road element that considers not only the absolute pavement characteristics but also the way in which the driver approaches them and trusts them...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Current {{cellular}} subscribers have {{a geographic}} phone number (e. g., in AMPS and U. S. digital cellular systems) or a number which contains the network provider’s identity (e. g., in GSM), and whenever subscribers register or receive (and possibly, originate) a call, a {{home location register}} (HLR) database has to be queried. The wired infrastructure supports a function called global title translation (GTT) that converts the subscriber’s number to an HLR database address. A special feature of next generation wireless access service will be to support personal communication services (PCS’s) and wireless subscribers with <b>portable</b> personal <b>numbers,</b> or nongeographic phone numbers (NGPN’s), that do not indicate the service provider or HLR database serving the user. In addition, the GTT function may not be available when the wired backbone is an ATM network. Thus a key function required in future wireless access systems with wired ATM backbones will be the ability to translate an NGPN to {{the identity of the}} HLR which serves the subscriber, a process we call NGPN translation. (Note that the same functionality is also needed for subscribers with local, <b>portable</b> phone <b>numbers.)</b> We discuss the requirements of NGPN translation and some alternative schemes. We propose two schemes for fast, efficient, scalable and flexible NGPN translation which use ideas of dynamic hashing, caching, and indirection. The schemes use a hash function in the visiting location registers (VLR’s) (or serving SCP) and a set of distributed translation servers which store the NGPN-to-HLR mapping. We discuss how the operations required to maintain the translation information can be performed. Finally, we perform a simplified analysis of the scalability of the alternative schemes as well as the hash-based schemes we propose.

By the time the first class of freshman had advanced to seniority, enrollment was about 1800.

40|$|Several {{issues have}} become {{important}} due to {{recent developments in}} communication devices and services, especially with increase in wireless and wireline devices and networking options. These are, congestion in area codes, number portability, need to support intelligent networking, wireless-wireline integration, and demand for new user services. For meeting the requirements needed to overcome the associated problems, new numbering schemes are being proposed. Such schemes would not only relieve the extra burden on conventional geographical area codes due to the addition of vast numbers of wireless units, but also provide additional implementation benefits. Such schemes would also {{make it possible to}} associate multiple devices with a person, and multiple persons with a device, while giving people the option to have a single point where they can define who can reach them, at what device, and at what times. The proposed scheme, termed Globally Unique <b>Portable</b> <b>Numbering</b> (GUPN), uses data compression to achieve a format which has the same number of digits as the North American Numbering Plan and offers easy integration into current telephone numbering. An addressing scheme is also proposed for fixed components of communication systems and for reporting current locations of mobile devices. We call this the Globally Unique Fixed Location Numbering (GUFLN) addressing for fixed components. A performance analysis of the proposed scheme is conducted in comparison with existing schemes by considering the following criteria [...] -number congestion with increase in number of persons and devices, amount of data transmitted and stored, and call routing and location update costs. Further studies are conducted using a queuing theory framework for evaluating a variety of possible database architectures with different levels of data replication for implementation of this person-based numbering scheme. Delays in query and update operations are used as the performance metrics for four such representative database architectures. The practical issues arising from implementation considerations are also discussed with possible solutions. This scheme is expected to offer contributions towards Number Portability (NP), Wireless Intelligent Networks (WIN), and wireless-wireline integration...|$|R

40|$|Ultrafine {{particles}} (UFPs) {{have been}} associated with negative effects on human health. Emissions from motor vehicles are the principal source of UFPs in urban air. A study in Vancouver suggested that UFP concentrations were related to density of fast food restaurants near the monitoring sites. A previous monitoring campaign could not separate the contribution of restaurants from road traffic. The main goal of this study has been the quantification of fast food restaurants' contribution to outdoor UFP concentrations. A <b>portable</b> particle <b>number</b> counter (DiscMini) has been used to carry out mobile monitoring in a largely pedestrianized area in the city center of Utrecht. A fixed route passing 17 fast food restaurants was followed on 8 days. UFP concentrations in front of the restaurants were 1. 61 times higher than in a nearby square without any local sources used as control area and 1. 22 times higher compared with all measurements conducted in between the restaurants. Adjustment for other sources such as passing mopeds, smokers or candles did not explain the increase. In conclusion, fast food restaurants result in significant increases in outdoor UFP concentrations in front of the restaurant...|$|R

40|$|Enterococcus faecium, {{a common}} {{inhabitant}} {{of the human}} gut, has emerged in the last 2 decades as an important multidrugresistant nosocomial pathogen. Since {{the start of the}} 21 st century, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has been used to study the molecular epidemiology of E. faecium. However, due to the use of a small number of genes, the resolution of MLST is limited. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) now allows for high-resolution tracing of outbreaks, but current WGS-based approaches lack standardization, rendering them less suitable for interlaboratory prospective surveillance. To overcome this limitation, we developed a core genome MLST (cgMLST) scheme for E. faecium. cgMLST transfers genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diversity into a standardized and <b>portable</b> allele <b>numbering</b> system that is far less computationally intensive than SNPbased analysis of WGS data. The E. faecium cgMLST scheme was built using 40 genome sequences that represented the diversity of the species. The scheme consists of 1, 423 cgMLST target genes. To test the performance of the scheme, we performed WGS analysis of 103 outbreak isolates from five different hospitals in the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany. The cgMLST scheme performed well in distinguishing between epidemiologically related and unrelated isolates, even between those that had the same sequence type (ST), which denotes the higher discriminatory power of this cgMLST scheme over that of conventional MLST. We also show that in terms of resolution, the performance of the E. faecium cgMLST scheme is equivalent to that of an SNP-based approach. In conclusion, the cgMLST scheme developed in this study facilitates rapid, standardized, and high-resolution tracing of E. faecium outbreaks...|$|R
40|$|A {{system based}} on {{low-power}} radio transponders and associated analog and digital electronic circuitry has been developed for locating firefighters and other emergency workers deployed in a building or other structure. The system has obvious potential for saving lives and {{reducing the risk of}} injuries. The system includes (1) a central station equipped with a computer and a transceiver; (2) active radio-frequency (RF) identification tags, each placed in a different room or region of the structure; and (3) transponder units worn by the emergency workers. The RF identification tags can be installed in a new building as built-in components of standard fire-detection devices or ground-fault electrical outlets or can be attached to such devices in a previously constructed building, without need for rewiring the building. Each RF identification tag contains information that uniquely identifies it. When each tag is installed, information on its location and identity are reported to, and stored at, the central station.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{present the}} design and {{preliminary}} results of a pilot study to investigate the use of opt-in Internet panel surveys for behavioral health surveillance. IntroductionToday, surveyors in both {{the private and public}} sectors are facing considerable challenges with random digit dialed (RDD) landline telephone samples. The population coverage rates for landline telephone surveys are being eroded by wireless-only households, <b>portable</b> telephone <b>numbers,</b> telecommunication barriers (e. g., call forwarding, call blocking and pager connections), technological barriers (call-blocking, busy circuits) and increased refusal rates and privacy concerns. Addressing these issues increasingly drives up the costs associated with dual-frame telephone surveys designed to be representative of the target population as well as hinders their ability to be fully representative of the adult population of each state and territory in the United States. MethodsA collaborative pilot project was designed to assess the feasibility and accuracy of opt-in Internet panel surveys for behavioral health surveillance. This pilot project is a collaboration between the CDC, four state departments of health, opt-in Internet panel providers and the leads of several large surveys and systems such as the Patient-Reported Outcome Measures Information System (PROMIS) and the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). Pilot projects were conducted in four states (GA, IL, NY, and TX) and four Metropolitan Statistical Areas (Atlanta, Chicago, New York City, and Houston). Data were collected using three different opt-in Internet panels and sampling methods that differ with respect to recruitment strategy, sample selection and sample matching to the adult population of each geography. A question bank consisting of 80 questions was developed to benchmark with other existing surveys used to assess various public health surveillance measures (e. g., the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the PROMIS, National Survey on Drug Use and Health, and the CCES). ResultsWe present comparative analyses that assess {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} different opt-in Internet panels sampling methodologies across a range of parameters including cost, geography, timeliness, usability, and ease of use for technology transfer to states and local communities. Recommendations for future efforts in behavioral health surveillance are given based on these results...|$|R
40|$|Amplicon {{targeted}} high-throughput sequencing {{has become}} a popular tool for the culture-independent analysis of microbial communities. Although the data obtained with this approach are <b>portable</b> and the <b>number</b> of sequences available in public databases is increasing, no tool has been developed yet for the analysis and presentation of data obtained in different studies. This work describes an approach {{for the development of}} a database for the rapid exploration and analysis of data on food microbial communities. Data from seventeen studies investigating the structure of bacterial communities in dairy, meat, sourdough and fermented vegetable products, obtained by 16 S rRNA gene targeted high-throughput sequencing, were collated and analysed using Gephi, a network analysis software. The resulting database, which we named FoodMicrobionet, was used to analyse nodes and network properties and to build an interactive web-based visualisation. The latter allows the visual exploration of the relationships between Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and samples and the identification of core- and sample-specific bacterial communities. It also provides additional search tools and hyperlinks for the rapid selection of food groups and OTUs and for rapid access to external resources (NCBI taxonomy, digital versions of the original articles). Microbial interaction network analysis was carried out using CoNet on datasets extracted from FoodMicrobionet: the complexity of interaction networks was much lower than that found for other bacterial communities (human microbiome, soil and other environments). This may reflect both a bias in the dataset (which was dominated by fermented foods and starter cultures) and the lower complexity of food bacterial communities. Although some technical challenges exist, and are discussed here, the net result is a valuable tool for the exploration of food bacterial communities by the scientific community and food industry...|$|R
