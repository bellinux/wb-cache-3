2500|$|PET is {{subjected}} to various types of degradations during processing. The main degradations that can occur are hydrolytic, and probably most important, thermal oxidation. When PET degrades, several things happen: discoloration, chain scissions resulting in reduced molecular weight, formation of acetaldehyde, and cross-links ("gel" [...] or [...] "fish-eye" [...] formation). Discoloration {{is due to the}} formation of various chromophoric systems following prolonged thermal treatment at elevated temperatures. This becomes a problem when the optical requirements of the polymer are very high, such as in packaging applications. The thermal and thermooxidative degradation results in poor <b>processibility</b> characteristics and performance of the material.|$|E

50|$|Energetic {{polymers}} (e.g. nitro or azido derivates of polymers) {{can be used}} as {{a binder}} to increase the explosive power in comparison with inert binders. Energetic plasticizers can be also used. The addition of a plasticizer lowers the sensitivity of the explosive and improves its <b>processibility.</b>|$|E
50|$|Two {{important}} addition {{reactions of}} SWNT sidewall are: (1) Fluorination, and (2) Aryl diazonium salt addition. These functional groups on SWNT improve solubility and <b>processibility.</b> Moreover, these reactions allow for combining unique properties of SWNTs {{with those of}} other compounds. Above all, the selective diazonium chemistry can be used to separate the semiconducting and metallic nanotubes.|$|E
5000|$|The NORYL {{family of}} {{modified}} PPE resins consists of amorphous blends of PPO polyphenylene ether (PPE) resin and polystyrene. They combine the inherent benefits of PPE resin (affordable high heat resistance, good electrical insulation properties, excellent hydrolytic stability {{and the ability}} to use non-halogen fire retardant packages), with excellent dimensional stability, good <b>processibility</b> and low density.|$|E
50|$|Polyamide-imides {{display a}} {{combination}} of properties from both polyamides and polyimides, such as high strength, melt <b>processibility,</b> exceptional high heat capability, and broad chemical resistance. Polyamide-imide polymers can be processed into {{a wide variety of}} forms, from injection or compression molded parts and ingots, to coatings, films, fibers and adhesives. Generally these articles reach their maximum properties with a subsequent thermal cure process.|$|E

50|$|The first discotic {{liquid crystal}} was found in 1977 by the Indian {{researcher}} Sivaramakrishna Chandrasekhar. This molecule has one central benzene ring surrounded by six alkyl chains. Since then, {{a large number of}} discoid mesogenic compounds have been discovered in which triphenylene, porphyrin, phthalocyanine, coronene, and other aromatic molecules are involved. The typical columnar liquid-crystalline molecules have a pi-electron-rich aromatic core attached by flexible alkyl chains. This structure is attracting particular attention for potential molecular electronics in which aromatic parts transport electrons or holes and alkyl chains act as insulating parts. The advantages of liquid-crystalline conductors are their anisotropy, <b>processibility,</b> and self-healing characteristics for structural defects.|$|E
50|$|Polystyrene {{generally}} has stiffness, transparency, <b>processibility,</b> and dielectric qualities {{that make it}} useful. However, its low impact resistance at low temperatures makes catastrophic fracture failure when cold more likely. The most widely used version of toughened polystyrene is called high impact polystyrene or HIPS. Being cheap and easy to thermoform (see thermoforming), it is utilized for many everyday uses. HIPS is made by polymerizing styrene in a polybutadiene rubber solution. After the polymerization reaction begins, the polystyrene and rubber phases separate. When  phase separation begins, the two phases compete for volume until phase inversion occurs and the rubber can distribute throughout the matrix. The alternative emulsion polymerization with styrene-butadiene-styrene or styrene-butadiene copolymers allows fine-tuned manipulation of particle size distribution. This method makes use of the core-shell architecture.|$|E
50|$|In {{plastics}} engineering, {{as in most}} engineering disciplines, {{the economics}} of a product plays an important role. The cost of plastic materials ranges from the cheapest commodity plastics used in mass-produced consumer products to the very expensive, specialty plastics. The cost of a plastic product is measured in different ways, and the absolute cost of a plastic material is difficult to ascertain. Cost is often measured in price per pound of material, or price per unit volume of material. In many cases however, {{it is important for}} a product to meet certain specifications, and cost could then be measured in price per unit of a property. Price with respect to <b>processibility</b> is often important, as some materials need to be processed at very high temperatures, increasing the amount of cooling time a part needs. In a large production run cooling time is very expensive.|$|E
50|$|Plasticizers make it {{possible}} to achieve improved compound processing characteristics, while also providing flexibility in the end-use product. Ester plasticizers are selected based upon cost-performance evaluation. The rubber compounder must evaluate ester plasticizers for compatibility, <b>processibility,</b> permanence and other performance properties. The wide variety of ester chemistries that are in production include sebacates, adipates, terephthalates, dibenzoates, gluterates, phthalates, azelates, and other specialty blends. This broad product line provides an array of performance benefits required for the many elastomer applications such as tubing and hose products, flooring, wall-coverings, seals and gaskets, belts, wire and cable, and print rolls. Low to high polarity esters provide utility {{in a wide range of}} elastomers including nitrile, polychloroprene, EPDM, chlorinated polyethylene, and epichlorohydrin. Plasticizer-elastomer interaction is governed by many factors such as solubility parameter, molecular weight, and chemical structure. Compatibility and performance attributes are key factors in developing a rubber formulation for a particular application.|$|E

40|$|Processing {{behaviors}} of starch film using a twin screw extruder were studied; {{in particular the}} effect of processing conditions, such as temperature, screw speed, feeding speed, and water content, on the extrusion torque and die pressure were systematically investigated.

It was found that the <b>processibility</b> was decreased as the amylose content increased. Pre-mixing and equilibration improve the <b>processibility</b> of starch films, especially for the high amylose starches.
