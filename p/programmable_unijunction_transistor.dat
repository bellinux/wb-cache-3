It is widely used in the triggering circuits for silicon controlled rectifiers. The low cost per unit, combined with its unique characteristic, have warranted its use {{in a wide variety}} of applications like oscillators, pulse generators, saw-tooth generators, triggering circuits, phase control, timing circuits, and voltage- or current-regulated supplies.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explore the possibility to couple two van der Pol (vdP) oscillators via a resistance-capacitance (RC) network comprising a Ag-TiOx-Al memristive device. The coupling was mediated by connecting the gate terminals of two <b>programmable</b> <b>unijunction</b> <b>transistors</b> (PUTs) through the network. In the high resistance state (HRS) the memresistance was in the order of MOhm leading to two independent selfsustained oscillators characterized by the different frequencies f 1 and f 2 and no phase relation between the oscillations. After a few cycles and in dependency of the mediated pulse amplitude the memristive device switched to the low resistance state (LRS) and a frequency adaptation and phase locking was observed. The experimental results are underlined by theoretically considering a system of two coupled vdP equations. The presented neuromorphic circuitry conveys two essentials principle of interacting neuronal ensembles: synchronization and memory. The experiment may path the way to larger neuromorphic networks in which the coupling parameters can vary in time and strength and are realized by memristive devices...|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of applications of a one-dimensional (1 -D) map as an information processing element {{are found in the}} literature on artificial neural networks, image processing systems, and secure communication systems. In search of an efficient hardware implementation of a 1 -D map, we discovered that the bifurcating neuron (BN), which was introduced elsewhere as a mathematical model of a biological neuron under the influence of an external sinusoidal signal, could provide a compact solution. The original work on the BN indicated that its firing time sequence, when it was subject to a sinusoidal driving signal, was related to the sine-circle map, suggesting that the BN can compute the sine-circle map. Despite its rich array of dynamical properties, the mathematical description of the BN is simple enough to lend itself to a compact circuit implementation. In this paper, we generalize the original work and show that the computational power of the BN can be extended to compute an arbitrary 1 -D map. Also, we describe two possible circuit models of the BN: the <b>programmable</b> <b>unijunction</b> <b>transistor</b> oscillator neuron, which was introduced in the original work as a circuit model of the BN, and the integrated-circuit relaxation oscillator neuron (IRON), which was developed for more precise modeling of the BN. To demonstrate the computational power of the BN, we use the IRON to generate the bifurcation diagrams of the sine-circle map, the logistic map, as well as the tent map, and then compare them with exact numerical versions. The programming of the BN to compute an arbitrary map can be done simply by changing the waveform of the driving signal, which is given to the BN externally; this feature makes the circuit models of the BN especially useful in the circuit implementation of a network of 1 -D maps...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} study of neural networks in which the processing elements are mathematically defined by parametric recursion functions and their activity can exhibit bifurcation between different dynamical modes; Bifurcating Recursive Processing Elements, their associated concepts and their associated set of tools provide an alternative framework for the field of artificial neural networks. Such a framework allows for the computation and coding of information with single action potential pulses (i. e., computation with time), and also contributes to the exploration of non fixed-point attractors, bifurcation, chaos, and non-linear dynamics as elements of neural modeling and neuro-like computation. ^ A novel method for the electronic implementation of recursive processing elements is described, {{which is based on}} the embedment of arbitrary iterative maps in the operation of the PUTON (<b>Programmable</b> <b>Unijunction</b> <b>Transistor</b> Oscillator Neuron) integrate and fire model neuron. The generality of the presented method offers the possibility of flexible complex behavior in spiking model neurons, and also suggests that different computing models based on recursive elements can be implemented with such electronic hardware. ^ The interaction between recursive processing elements is studied by developing the concept of parametric coupling, which is based on the dynamic modulation of the recursion functionality of the processing elements and allows for the exploration of controlled switching between several dynamical modes (i. e., chaotic orbits, fixed-point orbits, and diverse periodic orbits). Entropy and mutual information measures are used to quantify the complexity of activity and the flow of information between processing elements, while Limit Set Diagrams are introduced for the visualization of the dynamical states exhibited by populations of parametrically coupled recursive elements. A two-stage architecture is also explored in {{the study of}} networks facing spatio-temporal stimulation. The self-organization of populations of interacting processing elements into clusters and the switching from chaotic behavior to ordered behavior are studied. The use of such phenomena for the modeling of higher-level brain functions (such as feature binding and the search for dynamic attractors that are compatible with a given sensorial stimulation) is also suggested. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{efficient}} {{modeling of}} <b>unijunction</b> <b>transistor</b> (UJT) is an burning issue in power industries. The available SPICE based model provides V-I characteristic of UJT.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the study of novel enabling technologies for neurocomputing with optoelectronic hardware. Optoelectronic neurocomputing is attractive because it combines the best of two worlds, i. e., the inherent parallelism and massive interconnectivity of optics, and the versatile and nonlinear processing ability of electronics. However, to realize large-scale optoelectronic neurocomputers for real-world applications, dedicated neural hardware that is more inherently suited for neural computation and is more expandable toward large-scale integration is needed. ^ The main thrust of this dissertation concerns studying the dynamics of {{a new class of}} optical memory materials, electron trapping materials (ETMs), for optoelectronic neurocomputing applications. The novel approach we have taken is to use ETMs under simultaneous illumination by both the blue and IR light. Two theoretical models governing ETM dynamics with varied levels of sophistication are developed. Experimental study confirms the validity of these models and thus pave the way for applying ETMs to optoelectronic neurocomputing. Based on these results, it is shown that not only the large linear dynamic range of ETMs can be utilized in implementing the synaptic weight matrix of an optoelectronic neural network, but also the unique dynamics of ETMs are well suited for building large-scale optoelectronic pulsating neural networks. Schemes of employing ETMs to produce dense arrays of optoelectronic pulsating neurons and dense arrays of synapto-dendritic responses are studied and devised. A key proof-of-concept experiment, that involves an ETM with two nonlinear switching elements (a <b>programmable</b> <b>unijunction</b> <b>transistor</b> (PUT) and a single pulse generator, emulating the switching dynamics of the excitable membrane) in an optoelectronic feedback loop, is demonstrated to produce an optically controlled pulsating neuron. To further enhance the capability of ETMs, issues of writing information onto ETMs with electron beam (e-beam) are studied, and a general design framework for e-beam addressed ETM devices is developed. Based on this framework, two e-beam addressed ETM devices, namely, the field emitter micro-cathode ETM spatial light modulator and the ETM-based image intensifier, are presented including their structures, design considerations and expected performances. With their enhanced performance and capability, these devices form the essential building block of an ETM-based large-scale optoelectronic pulsating neural network. ^ We also studied neural computing architectures based on optoelectronic neural chips. Because of their integrated nature, neural chip architectures are free from problem associated with neural systems based on discrete components, and are also more expandable toward large-scale integration. Results of a feasibility study of an optoelectronic neural chip based on waveguide grating-coupled emitter/receiver arrays (WGCERAs) are presented. The structure and design of the WGCERAs draw heavily from advances in the technologies of integrated optics, optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEICs), and micro-fabrication techniques. To achieve uniform emitting/receiving characteristics that are required for neural computation, the use of grating coupler with tapered grating height profile is proposed and the required profile expression is derived. Methods of fabricating tapered grating and choices of waveguide materials that facilitate optoelectronic integration are discussed and suggested in light of today 2 ̆ 7 s advanced microfabrication technologies. Finally, compatibility issues of WGCERAs with potential spatial light modulators (SLMs) in forming a bidirectional neural network are discussed. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|E
