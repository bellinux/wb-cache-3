2500|$|The B-36 was {{too large}} to fit in most hangars. Since even an {{aircraft}} with {{the range of the}} B-36 needed to be stationed as close to enemy targets as possible, this meant the plane was largely based in the extreme weather locations of the northern continental United States, Alaska and the Arctic.

5000|$|A {{stall strip}} is a fixed device {{employed}} {{on the leading}} edge of fixed-wing aircraft to modify the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil. [...] Stall strips are used to initiate flow separation at chosen locations on the wing during high-angle of attack flight, so as to improve the controllability of the aircraft when it enters stall. They are typically employed in pairs, symmetrically on both wings. On aircraft where wing airflow is affected by asymmetrical <b>propeller</b> <b>wash,</b> a strip may be used on a single wing to reduce risk of entering a spin.|$|E
50|$|In a {{ship with}} a {{gas turbine engine}} and a variable-pitch propeller, astern thrust is {{simply a matter of}} {{changing}} the propeller pitch to a negative value. Most other propeller-driven ships will reverse the direction the prop spins. For a paddle wheel ship, reversing the direction of the paddle will provide astern propulsion. Redirecting the thrust of a water jet driven craft, changing the cyclic pitch of a Voith-Schneider propulsor, or rotating an azimuth thruster 180 degrees has the same effect. As the efficiency of traditional rudders is greatly reduced when not located in the <b>propeller</b> <b>wash,</b> only propulsion systems with steerable thrust provide adequate maneuverability during astern operation.|$|E
