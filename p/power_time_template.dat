In this paper, the normalized values are adopted {{for all of these}} three time series. The definition methods in the planning progress are as follows: First of all, the history data from all substations including wind power output, PV power output and electrical load in one province should be collected and organized. In the next place, all the historical data above are used to divide the wind power installed capacity, the PV power installed capacity and the maximum load in the corresponding year so that the annual load time sequence output, annual wind <b>power</b> <b>time</b> sequence output and annual PV <b>power</b> <b>time</b> sequence output can be obtained respectively. Finally, the value of wind power output, PV power output and load in the planning year can be calculated by using these normalized time series output multiplied by the predicted wind installed capacity, the predicted PV installed capacity and the predicted maximum load.|$|R

30|$|Wind power {{forecasting}} is {{a challenging}} task in power system research, and some effective {{methods have been}} promptly introduced to address wind power forecasting. Generally, there are physical models [3], auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) models [4, 5], Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods [6], spatial models [7], Kalman filter techniques [8], Grey model [9], and volatility model represented by GARCH model [10] and hybrid approaches [11]. Reference [10] reported that wind <b>power</b> <b>time</b> series exhibited time varying volatility and obtained satisfying results with the GARCH-M forecasting model. Nevertheless, the volatility characteristics of the wind <b>power</b> <b>time</b> series are complicated and meaningful. The latent news in these characteristics which can improve forecasting performance remains to be further explored. Based on the analysis of large amounts of real-world historical wind power data, it can be frequently found {{that a number of}} recurrent extra-large magnitude shocks exist in wind <b>power</b> <b>time</b> series. These shocks may lead particular impacts on the future volatility of wind <b>power</b> <b>time</b> series, which can be regarded as an outlier. In this work, this impact on the volatility is called outlier effect. This paper reflects efforts in analyzing outlier effect caused by the idiosyncratic shocks while outlier smooth transition autoregressive (OSTAR) structure is highlighted and the OSTAR-GARCH model is proposed to improve the performance of wind power forecasting.|$|R

30|$|According to the {{analysis}} above, the OSTAR-GARCH model can depict the outlier effect in the volatility and achieve a smooth transition between isolated outlier shocks and others in wind <b>power</b> <b>time</b> series.|$|R
30|$|Secondly, {{the shape}} {{parameter}} v of OSTAR-GED is 1.429912, which is {{significantly less than}} 2.0. Similarly, the freedom degree n of the OSTAR-t models is in a low level, 7.981401 and the corresponding z statistics is 7.467363, indicating that parameter n is significant. Consequently, the estimated values v and n from the non-Gaussian distributions explicitly reflect the fat-tail effect in wind <b>power</b> <b>time</b> series. Moreover, the Laplace distribution of the OSTAR-Laplace model also performs fat-tail effect naturally. The estimate results validate that the employment of three types of non-Gaussian distribution is appropriate and essential for modelling wind <b>power</b> <b>time</b> series.|$|R
30|$|In brief, {{considering}} {{the existence of}} outlier effect and the fat-tail effect in the wind <b>power</b> <b>time</b> series, it is a reasonably good practice to combine STAR structure and GARCH models with non-Gaussian distributions.|$|R

30|$|The OSTAR-GARCH {{models are}} {{proposed}} {{in this study}} for wind power forecasting, {{and the impact of}} outlier shocks in wind <b>power</b> <b>time</b> series is analyzed quantitatively by the proposed RSI. Forecasting performance comparison is achieved based on different criteria.|$|R
30|$|Firstly, the {{conditional}} variance is examined. The outlier effect parameters {{in the four}} OSTAR-GARCH models are − 0.148684, − 0.15329, − 0.16414, − 0.21517, respectively. The realistic meanings implicated by the signs of parameter λ are consistent; moreover, all the λ are negative, so it is indicated that the impact on {{the conditional}} variance of outlier shocks is suppressed. Ulteriorly, the volatility of wind <b>power</b> <b>time</b> series might be over-rated, on condition that the outlier shocks are treated the same as ordinary shocks, and this error evaluation of volatility may harm the performance of wind power forecasting. Therefore, the OSTAR-GARCH models are formulated to incorporate outlier effect in the volatility of wind <b>power</b> <b>time</b> series.|$|R
