5000|$|A network must {{establish}} a connection before two parties can send cells to each other. In ATM {{this is called}} a virtual circuit (VC). It can be a <b>permanent</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> (PVC), which is created administratively on the end points, or a switched virtual circuit (SVC), which is created as needed by the communicating parties. SVC creation is managed by signaling, in which the requesting party indicates the address of the receiving party, the type of service requested, and whatever traffic parameters may be applicable to the selected service. [...] "Call admission" [...] is then performed by the network to confirm that the requested resources are available and that a route exists for the connection.|$|E
5000|$|The {{designers}} of Frame Relay aimed {{to provide a}} telecommunication service for cost-efficient data transmission for intermittent traffic between local area networks (LANs) and between end-points in a wide area network (WAN). Frame Relay puts data in variable-size units called [...] "frames" [...] and leaves any necessary error-correction (such as retransmission of data) up to the end-points. This speeds up overall data transmission. For most services, the network provides a <b>permanent</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> (PVC), {{which means that the}} customer sees a continuous, dedicated connection without having to pay for a full-time leased line, while the service-provider figures out the route each frame travels to its destination and can charge based on usage.|$|E
5000|$|One DTE-DCE {{interface}} to an X.25 {{network has}} {{a maximum of}} 4095 logical channels on which it is allowed to establish virtual calls and permanent virtual circuits, although networks {{are not expected to}} support a full 4095 virtual circuits. For identifying the channel to which a packet is associated, each packet contains a 12 bit logical channel identifier made up of an 8-bit logical channel number and a 4-bit logical channel group number. [...] Logical channel identifiers remain assigned to a virtual circuit {{for the duration of the}} connection. [...] Logical channel identifiers identify a specific logical channel between the DTE (subscriber appliance) and the DCE (network), and only has local significance on the link between the subscriber and the network. The other end of the connection at the remote DTE is likely to have assigned a different logical channel identifier. The range of possible logical channels is split into 4 groups: channels assigned to permanent virtual circuits, assigned to incoming virtual calls, two-way (incoming or outgoing) virtual calls, and outgoing virtual calls. [...] (Directions refer to the direction of virtual call initiation as viewed by the DTE they all carry data in both directions.) The ranges allowed a subscriber to be configured to handle significantly differing numbers of calls in each direction while reserving some channels for calls in one direction. All International networks are required to implement support for permanent virtual circuits, two-way logical channels and one-way logical channels outgoing; one-way logical channels incoming is an additional optional facility. [...] DTE-DCE interfaces are not required to support more than one logical channel. [...] Logical channel identifier zero will not be assigned to a <b>permanent</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> or virtual call. [...] The logical channel identifier of zero is used for packets which don't relate to a specific virtual circuit (e.g. packet layer restart, registration, and diagnostic packets).|$|E

A virtual private network is provided by provisioning a set of permanent (long term) virtual circuits between customer endpoints on a large backbone network.

Routing decisions must be made on-line without any knowledge of future request sets.

40|$|This report {{examines}} ATM <b>Permanent</b> <b>Virtual</b> <b>Circuit</b> (PVC) and Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC) pricing {{from the}} network provider’s point of view. Specifically, {{based on previous}} work [1] that predicts customer choices between PVC and SVC service based on pricing parameters, we determine pricing parameters that will optimize the service provider’s net income, taking into account both revenue derived from customers and {{the costs associated with}} providing PVC and SVC service. The analysis is based on a general model of the user population’s traffic characteristics. The results show that by increasing bandwidth allocation prices, the service provider can encourage more users to choose SVC service, thereby increasing total revenue and reducing the provider’s bandwidth costs, but driving up the provider’s connection setup costs. The point at which the provider’s net income is maximized is strongly influenced by the relationship between the provider’s bandwidth costs and per-connection setup costs; smaller relative setup costs will motivate the service provider to encourage (through pricing parameters) more users to utilize SVC service.

40|$|The {{beginning}} of the 1990 s brought new technologies in the telecommunication networks. Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) has been chosen as the transmission technology of broadband networks. The standardisation of ATM is practically finished today, the implementations are ready and the ATM equipment is largely introduced by users and service providers. At {{the end of the}} 1990 s the Internet Protocol (IP) became the fastest growing network layer protocol that is applicable over any data link layer. The convergence of these two technologies became reality at the {{beginning of}} the year 2000, but a couple of months later the telecommunication market entered the deepest recession ever seen. In the current marketplace the service providers must improve network management to reduce operation costs. ATM network service providers offered mainly <b>permanent</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> connections to customers in the last years, but recently there is an increasing interest to offer switched virtual circuit (SVC) connections to end users. The SVC is based on the use of signalling protocols. Our paper focuses on the performance of call processing in ATM networks. Based on a series of measurements on four types of ATM switches we have established some generalised conclusions, which are switch invariant features of the ATM signalling flows. These results have a wide generality among ATM switches and they can be used to model and design large ATM signalling networks. Our new model is validated against the measurement results on the 7 -node backbone of the TEN- 155 Pan-European ATM network. The second part of the paper shows that a cascaded network is a good estimator for the signalling performance of an arbitrary network. In addition, it is demonstrated that the call density of the network is an important [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the analysis and}} study of short and long-term traffic patterns of heterogeneous networks. A large number of traffic profiles from different locations and network environments have been determined. The result of the analysis of these patterns {{has led to a}} new parameter, namely the 'application signature'. It was found that these signatures manifest themselves in various granularities over time, and are usually unique to an application, <b>permanent</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> (PVC), user or service. The differentiation of the application signatures into different categories creates a foundation for short and long-term management of networks. The thesis therefore looks from the micro and macro perspective on traffic management, covering both aspects. The long-term traffic patterns have been used to develop a novel methodology for network planning and design. As the size and complexity of interconnected systems grow steadily, usually covering different time zones, geographical and political areas, a new methodology has been developed as part of this thesis. A part of the methodology is a new overbooking mechanism, which stands in contrast to existing overbooking methods created by companies like Bell Labs. The new overbooking provides companies with cheaper network design and higher average throughput. In addition, new requirements like risk factors have been incorporated into the methodology, which lay historically outside the design process. A large network service provider has implemented the overbooking mechanism into their network planning process, enabling practical evaluation. The other aspect of the thesis looks at short-term traffic patterns, to analyse how congestion can be controlled. Reoccurring short-term traffic patterns, the application signatures, have been used for this research to develop the "packet train model" further. Through this research a new congestion control mechanism was created to investigate how the application signatures and the "extended packet train model" could be used. To validate the results, a software simulation has been written that executes the proprietary congestion mechanism and the new mechanism for comparison. Application signatures for the TCP/IP protocols have been applied in the simulation and the results are displayed and discussed in the thesis. The findings show the effects that frame relay congestion control mechanisms have on TCP/IP, where the re-sending of segments, buffer allocation, delay and throughput are compared. The results prove that application signatures can be used effectively to enhance existing congestion control mechanisms. AT&T (UK) Ltd, Englan...|$|E
40|$|A new handoff {{management}} scheme for wireless ATM networks is proposed. In this scheme, all cells {{are connected to}} their neighboring cells by <b>permanent</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> (PVCs) and to the access switch (AS) by switched <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> (SVCs) which are only for new calls. Some carefully chosen cells, called rerouting cells, are also connected to the AS by PVCs. In summary, if a mobile roams to an ordinary neighboring cell, its traffic path is simply elongated by a PVC connecting {{the old and new}} cells. If a mobile roams to a rerouting cell, its traffic path is rerouted to a PVC between the AS and rerouting cell. By using PVC's for handoff calls, we can guarantee fast and seamless handoff. At the same time, our scheme improves the path efficiency by limiting the maximum number of hops that a path can be extended. Also, allowing path rerouting at a suitable time means the network resources are more efficiently utilized. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
