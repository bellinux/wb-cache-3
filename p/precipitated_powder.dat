The variables were the heat treatment {{temperature of the}} <b>precipitated</b> <b>powders,</b> {{the composition of the}} setting liquid, the liquid-to-powder ratio (LPR), and the time over which hardened specimens were cured in air. The properties analysed were the phase composition of the starting powder, the initial setting time, the evolution of the storage shear modulus (G) and the loss shear modulus (G '') with the cement paste curing time (t), and the compressive strength. The presence of alpha-TCP in CPC facilitated the setting and hardening properties due to its progressive dissolution and the formation of brushite crystals. As far as the liquid composition is concerned, in cases where citric acid was used, adding a rheology modifier (10 wt. % polyethylene glycol or 0. 5 wt. % hydroxyl propylmethylcellulose) to the acid led to an increase in the initial setting time, while an increase in the acid concentration led to a decrease in the initial setting time. The initial setting time showed to be very sensitive towards the LPR. The evolution of C and G '' with curing time reflected the internal structural changes of cement pastes during the setting process. The compressive strength of the wet-hardened cement specimens with and without Mg increased with curing time increasing, being slightly higher in the case of Mg-substituted CPC.

Yet here was this stranger, provincial, overdressed, and extravagant, whose vulgarity was only made tolerable through her good humor, who had awakened that interest which the refined Mrs. Peyton had never yet been able to touch. As Mrs. McClosky swept out of the room with Susy he turned away with a sinking heart.|$|R
40|$|Crystal {{structures}} and fine structures of high polymers affect their {{physical and chemical}} 	properties， so that many investigators have worked to clear them. In this report it is 	attempted to elucidate the crystal {{structures and}} the fine structures of 6 nylon polymer and its 	fiber， and their mutual dependencies as much as possible， {{by the use of}} those data from xray 	diffraction， small angle x-ray diffraction， electrion-microscopy and electron-diffraction. 	The results obtained are as follows. When acid solution of 6 nylon are poured into water， 	 6 nylon are precipitated and their crystal structures are dependent upon the temperature 	of water. <b>Precipitated</b> <b>powders</b> are haxagonal， monoclinic and their mixture in crystalline 	form according as the temperature of water is high， low or intermediate. Fine structures of 	hexagonal form， such as microfibril and their spherulitic aggregations are also observed 	at the thin films spread on water surface. Powders of hexagonal form are changed to solid 	amorphous structure by grinding and then to monoclinic by annealing， but by the annealing 	only they do not chang to monoclinic form except in the case that theyare slowly crystallized 	by the cooling from melt. 	 6 nylon specimen crystallized in the boiling water shows two step orientation phenomena 	during drawing similar to polyethylene or 66 nylon. The structure and properties of fully 	drawn 6 nylon are greatly varied with the annealing at the temperature slightly below the 	melting point. WTe may interprete that fiber structures constructed by the extended molecules 	are altered to a more stable state of strUcture constructed by the folding molecules at high 	temperature near the melting point， and that with this structural change there occure some 	remarkable changes， such as contraction of length， disordering of orientation， change of 	small angle diffractions and so on. These phenomena are discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the synthesis and characterization of Ni(OH) {sub 2 } powders by homogeneous precipitation. Previous research of the same method showed conflicting results and complete characterization of the particle morphology was not carried out. This study has produced precipitates having a composition of 2 Ni(OH) {sub 2 }{center_dot}Ni(HCO{sub 3 }) {sub 1. 85 }(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 0. 15 }. The XRD patterns showed peaks commonly observed for {alpha}-Ni(OH) {sub 2 }. The precipitates produced from low and high cation concentration solutions showed that the mean particle size and specific surface area increased with aging time. The high specific surface area measured suggested that the particle growth occurred through the aggregation of nanosized crystallites. The TEM micrographs confirmed that the particles were actually aggregates of thin films or sheets that were crumpled and intertwined together. This work also investigated the effect of dispersant on the particle morphology. The addition of dispersants did not alter the density of the particles implying that the dispersants were not incorporated into the solid phase. A general decrease in mean particle size at each aging time was observed resulting in an increase in specific surface area. The use of dispersants provided steric hindrance for the particles in the solution to aggregate, thus smaller particles were observed. Cyclic voltammetric tests were carried out to see if the high surface area Ni(OH) {sub 2 } produced in this work had superior performance characteristics compared to the commercial powders currently available. Indeed, the study showed that the homogeneously precipitated Ni(OH) {sub 2 } had higher coulombic efficiency and degree of reversibility than the commercial powders. The efficiency values of all the homogeneously <b>precipitated</b> <b>powders</b> were approximately 90 %. The same efficiency values observed were probably due to the same specific surface areas of the powders after aging in KOH solution...|$|R

50|$|The Sherritt {{process is}} a hydrometallurgical process named for Sherritt Gordon Mines Ltd. (now Sherritt International) of Sherridon and Lynn Lake Manitoba Canada, based on the older Forward process {{developed}} by Dr. Frank Forward for the recovery of copper and nickel from those same mines. Nickel sulfide concentrates can be treated by either roasting or flash smelting to produce matte from which nickel and cobalt can be recovered hydrometallurgically, {{or they may be}} treated by an ammonia solution pressure leach. The residue is removed. A feed of matte and sulfide concentrate containing approximately 0.4% cobalt and 30% sulfur is pressure leached at elevated temperature and pressure in an ammoniacal solution to produce a solution of nickel, copper and cobalt. By boiling away the ammonia; copper is precipitated as a sulfide and sent to a smelter. Hydrogen sulfide is added to the autoclave to remove nickel sulfide and copper sulfide which is fed back to the leaching process. Air is then passed through the solution in the autoclave for oxyhydrolysis. The solution is then reduced with hydrogen, again at high temperature and pressure, to <b>precipitate</b> nickel <b>powder</b> (>99%). The remaining solution (containing approximately equal proportions of nickel and cobalt sulfides), is then adjusted (to a lower temperature and pressure) to precipitate the mixed sulfides and the fluid is concentrated and crystallized into ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4). The mixed sulfides are pressure leached with air and sulfuric acid. Ammonia is then added to remove potassium and iron as jarosite (KFe (OH)6(SO4)2). More ammonia and air is added for oxidation. The solution is removed from the autoclave and sulfuric acid added to remove nickel as nickel(II) sulfate-ammonium sulfate hexahydrate ((NiSO4)•((NH4)2SO4)•6H2O) which is then sent to have its nickel recovered. The solution is then further reduced with more sulfuric acid and cobalt metal powder is added to aid in the nucleation of precipitants (seeding). Addition of hydrogen gas to saturation <b>precipitates</b> cobalt <b>powder</b> with a purity of approximately 99.6%.|$|R
