40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the effects of certain {{abrasion}} procedures upon specific physical properties of a high wet modulus rayon. The type of abrasion applied included surface abrasion in dry and wet condition, edge abrasion in dry condition, and flexing abrasion in dry condition. Dry flexing abrasion was performed only in the Stoll tester but all other abrasion procedures were performed both in the Accelerator and Stoll tester. Breaking load or bursting strength, elongation, weight of fabric and microscopy were the criteria used to evaluate abrasion damage. Five null hypotheses were tested to determine whether any significant correlations existed (1) among the <b>percentage</b> <b>losses</b> in physical properties or (2) between period of abrasion and the <b>percentage</b> <b>losses</b> in physical properties as a result of abrasion; to determine whether any significant differences in the <b>percentage</b> <b>losses</b> in physical properties occurred (3) between warpwise and fillingwise abraded specimens or (4) between specimens abraded wet and dry; and to determine (5) whether each side of a specimen was evenly abraded in the Accelerotor. Analysis of data obtained was based on the regression analysis and the t-test. Damage of the fabric, yarn and fiber observed under a microscope seemed to increase with the increasing period of abrasion. The yarn and fabric tended to deteriorate continuously. Fibrillation of the fiber was observed at the end point on specimens subjected to wet surface abrasion in the Stoll tester. Correlations among the <b>percentage</b> <b>losses</b> in physical properties were positive and generally significant. The rate change in physical properties had a positive linear relationship with period of abrasion. Some abrasion procedures had significantly different effects upon certain physical properties of warpwise specimens and filling specimens. There were significantly greater <b>percentage</b> <b>losses</b> in breaking load and weight of specimens subjected to dry surface abrasion than to wet surface abrasion in the Accelerotor. Each side of specimens subjected to dry surface abrasion in the Accelerotor was unevenly abraded in terms of the <b>percentage</b> <b>losses</b> in breaking load and elongation, and those subjected to wet surface abrasion in the Accelerotor were unevenly abraded in terms of the <b>percentage</b> <b>losses</b> in elongation. It was concluded that different abrasion procedures affected a physical property differently, and a given procedure of abrasion affected various properties of the fabric differently...|$|R

2500|$|In {{ferroelectric}} Class 2 ceramic capacitors, capacitance decreases over time. This {{behavior is}} called [...] "aging". This aging occurs in ferroelectric dielectrics, where domains of polarization in the dielectric {{contribute to the}} total polarization. Degradation of polarized domains in the dielectric decreases permittivity and therefore capacitance over time. The aging follows a logarithmic law. This defines the decrease of capacitance as constant percentage for a time decade after the soldering recovery time at a defined temperature, for example, in the period from 1 to 10hours at 20°C. As the law is logarithmic, the <b>percentage</b> <b>loss</b> of capacitance will twice between 1h and 100h and 3 times between 1h and 1,000h and so on. Aging is fastest near the beginning, and the absolute capacitance value stabilizes over time.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical study {{to minimize the}} heat lost during the power stroke of hydrogen-fueled, 4 -stroke spark ignition engine. The effects of various design and operating parameters like engine speed, equivalence ratio, ignition timing, compression ratio and spark plug location on heat losses was studied. Then, the effect of heat loss on the engine’s performance and emission characteristics was conducted with aim to minimize it. The study showed that the <b>percentage</b> heat <b>loss</b> decreased with increase in engine speed. Further, changing the compression ratio from 7 to 11 produced change of around 2 - 3 % in <b>percentage</b> heat <b>loss,</b> while changing the spark plug location from periphery to center produced change of around 1 - 1. 5 % in <b>percentage</b> heat <b>loss</b> with maximum change occurring at lean mixtures.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to conduct a systematic review of published literature on ammonia (NH 3) and enteric methane (CH 4) emissions from beef and dairy cattle operations to obtain statistically representative emission factors based on dietary intakes of nutrients or energy, and to identify major causes of emission variations. NH 3 emissions from lagoon or other manure storage facilities were not included in this review. The NH 3 and CH 4 emission rates, expressed as a <b>percentage</b> <b>losses</b> of dietary nutrients or energy, demonstrated much less variation compared with emission rates expressed in g/animal/day. Air temperature and dietary crude protein (CP) content were identified as two major factors that can affect NH 3 emission rates in addition to farm type. Feed digestibility and energy intake were identified as two major factors that can affect CH 4 emission rates expressed as a <b>percentage</b> <b>losses</b> of dietary energy. Generally, increasing productivity and feed efficiency represented the greatest opportunity for mitigating NH 3 or CH 4 emissions per unit of livestock product. Expressing CH 4 loss on a digestible energy basis rather than a gross energy intake basis can better represent the large variation among diets and the effects of varying dietary emission mitigation strategies...|$|R
