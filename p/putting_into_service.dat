Diesel fuel cost $11.61 but produced 133.13 train miles per ton. In effect, diesels ran six times as far as steamers utilizing fuel that cost only twice as much. This was due to the much better thermal efficiency of diesel engines compared to steam.

50|$|Rommel {{requested}} reinforcements, but the OKW, then completing {{preparations for}} Operation Barbarossa, refused. General Friedrich Paulus, {{head of the}} Operations Branch of OKH, arrived on 25 April to review the situation. He was present for a second failed attack on the city on 30 April. On 4 May Paulus ordered that no further attempts {{should be made to}} take Tobruk via a direct assault. This order was not open to interpretation, and Rommel {{had no choice but to}} comply. Aware of this order from intelligence reports, Churchill urged Wavell to seize the initiative. While awaiting further reinforcements and a shipment of 300 tanks that were already on their way, Wavell launched a limited offensive code named Operation Brevity on 15 May. The British briefly seized Sollum, Fort Capuzzo, and the important Halfaya Pass, a bottleneck along the coast near the border between Libya and Egypt. Rommel soon forced them to withdraw. On 15 June Wavell launched Operation Battleaxe. The attack was defeated in a four-day battle at Sollum and Halfaya Pass, resulting in the loss of 98 British tanks. The Germans lost 12 tanks, while capturing and <b>putting</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> over 20 British tanks. The defeat resulted in Churchill replacing Wavell with General Claude Auchinleck as theatre commander. Rommel appointed Heinrich Kirchheim as commander of 5th Light Division on 16 May, became displeased and replaced him with Johann von Ravenstein on 30 May 1941.|$|E

40|$|A primary {{function}} of electric utilities {{is to provide}} electric service to its customers as economically as possible and with reasonable degrees of continuity and duality. These objectives {{can be achieved by}} <b>putting</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> the appropriate generation, transmission and distribution facilities to supply the customer load demand and protection facilities to safeguard against unforeseen circumstances. The procedures used to protect a power system against these eventualities require a thorough investigation of each type, location and size of a fault. The complete solution of all the possibilities takes considerable time even for small systems that are used for educational purposes. This paper describes a user friendly and fast computer program for the simulation of power system faults using small educational systems. The program uses well-known mathematical models and performs simulation studies for various types of faults. The motivation {{for the development of the}} program is to provide students with a simple and useable tool for gaining appreciation of fault analysis. N/...|$|E
