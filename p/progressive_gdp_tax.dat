The size of GDP is influenced by various factors, including the Household Consumption, Investment, Government Spending, and Net Exports. One of the components that contribute to determine the amount of GDP is investment. According to the concept of macroeconomics, investment is also influenced by the <b>GDP,</b> <b>tax</b> revenue, and Currency. The reciprocal relationship between GDP and the investment is called a simultaneous relationship, therefore this study uses simultaneous equation Two Stage Least Squares (2 SLS). 2 SLS is one of the statistical methods used to replace the OLS method that {{can not be used to}} estimate an equation in a system of simultaneous equations.

40|$|This {{contribution}} is highlighted the quite striking paradox between the dominant discourse {{over the last}} twenty years or so, calling on the State to reduce its role, and the stability or even inertia of the major macroeconomic aggregates (public spending to <b>GDP,</b> <b>tax</b> burden), the permanent budget deficits and the increase in public debt. Globalisation has not neutralised French budget policy and has not put the squeeze on the French fiscal system. The weak empirical foundation of the pro-market macroeconomic arguments (risk of seigniorage, crowding-out effects, Barro-Ricardo equivalence…) and the efficiency of the automatic stabilisers in particular, have been highlighted as contributing to explain this situation. Finally, several salient points have been shown concerning evolutions in the structure of government revenues, one consequence of which is the decreasingly redistributive character of the French tax system.

These results have been criticized as implausibly large. For instance, Favero and Giavazzi (2010) (FG henceforth) argue RR's specification cannot {{be interpreted as a}} proper (truncated) moving average representation of the output process. They show that when the system is estimated in its VAR form, or its correct truncated MA representation, a unit realization of the RR shock has much smaller effects on GDP than in RR, typically about -. 5 percentage points of GDP. I argue that on theoretical grounds the discretionary component of taxation should be allowed to have different effects than the automatic response of tax revenues to macroeconomic variables; existing approaches, including FG's, that do not allow for this difference, exhibit impulse responses that are biased towards 0. I show that the correct impulse responses to a RR tax shock are about half-way between the large effects estimated by RR and the much smaller effects estimated by FG: typically, a one percentage point of <b>GDP</b> increase in <b>taxes</b> leads to a decline in GDP by about 1. 5 percentage points after 3 years.

A back of the envelope exercise reveals the following: a 1 p.p. of <b>GDP</b> <b>tax</b> burden shock in the period 2000 – 2010 Q 1 leads to an output multiplier of about - 0.14  p.p. of GDP, while in the whole sample case running till 2012 Q 4 the output multiplier is - 0.22  p.p. of GDP. Hence, in order for this whole sample effect to materialize (ceteris paribus) the tax burden multiplier of output in recent years, from 2010 Q- 2012 Q 4, should be expected to be about - 0.53  p.p. of GDP.

We investigate the {{effectiveness of}} Japanese fiscal policy over the 1976 – 1999 period using a structural VAR analysis of real <b>GDP,</b> <b>tax</b> revenues, and public expenditures. We find that expansionary fiscal policy, whether in the form of tax cuts or of public works spending, had significant stimulative effects. Using a new method of computing policy multipliers from structural VARs, we calculate that the multiplier on tax cuts is about 25 % higher at a four-year horizon than that on public works spending, though both are well in excess of one. A historical decomposition reveals that Japanese fiscal policy was con-tractionary over much of the 1990 s, and a significant proportion of the variation in growth can be attributed to fiscal policy shocks; accordingly, most of the run-up in public debt is attributable to declining tax revenues due to the recession. Examining savings behavior directly, we find limited evidence of Ricardian effects, insufficient to offset the short-term ef...|$|R
