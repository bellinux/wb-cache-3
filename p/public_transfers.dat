50|$|Sustained {{economic}} growth is noted as the main propelling agent for Poverty Reduction in Taiwan. While internal FDI has no noteworthy effect on the mean wage of poor people, outward FDI from Taiwan in the previous two decades appears to have adversely affected the poorest 20% of the populace. Poverty in Taiwan has nearly been eliminated, with under 1 percent of the populace considered as poor or earning the low-level pay. This implies more than 99 percent of the populace appreciates the advantages of Taiwan's economic flourishing and extraordinarily enhanced personal satisfaction. Beside lowly-paid families, the government offers support to other individuals, for example, the elderly and the incapacitated, who can't work. During 1980 to 1999 Taiwanese government developed a program called National Health Insurance program. NHI mainly provides economically disadvantaged people with quality healthcare at an affordable price. July 1993, the government of Taiwan started giving a monthly sponsorship to elderly people. People beyond 65 years old whose normal family salary is not exactly, or equivalent to, 1.5 times the base monthly costs are fit to get a monthly sponsorship of $174. Private transfers also {{play an important role}} in Taiwan for antipoverty according to the date Taiwan provided to the Luxembourg Income Studies, the results indicates the private transfer has greater impact than <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> in terms of proving welfare state.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{results show}} that taxpayers who receive no <b>public</b> <b>transfer</b> {{generally}} perceive their exchange equity with the government to be less equitable than taxpayers who receive a <b>public</b> <b>transfer.</b> Furthermore, {{the effect of the}} <b>public</b> <b>transfer</b> on reported income depends {{on the extent to which}} the taxpayers use the perception of equity in their tax reporting decisions. Subjects who perceive equity to be important in their tax reporting decisions report more income when they receive a <b>public</b> <b>transfer,</b> but report less income when they receive no <b>public</b> <b>transfer,</b> as predicted by equity theory. In contrast, subjects who perceive equity to be less important in their tax reporting decisions act directionally consistent with the economic effect.

40|$|How {{effective}} are <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> {{in protecting}} households facing financial crisis-induced negative shocks? Existing studies {{have not yet}} carefully considered the inter-relationship between <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> and the existing private transfer network. In {{the context of the}} financial crisis in Korea, this paper investigates the possible crowding-out effect of <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> on private transfers by explicitly considering the endogenous responses of private transfers against <b>public</b> <b>transfers.</b> By using two Korean household-level panel data sets for the periods of 1995 - 1998 and 1998 - 2003, we found a post-crisis, but not pre-crisis crowding-out effect of public transfers; more importantly, a crowding-in effect is observed during the crisis. The results suggest that private transfer networks were strengthened under the initial phase of the financial crisis, which possibly complemented <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> {{due to the lack of}} effective formal safety nets, while <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> became effective after the crisis, thereby replacing private transfers. Our results suggest that particularly at the initial stage of the crisis, the government could have played an important role in assisting households to weather the negative impacts of the crisis. ...|$|E

Four key findings emerge from our econometric analysis. First, householed with unemployed heads were well supported by private and <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> before and during the crisis while households with heads engaged in agriculture, fisheries and part-time jobs were supported only by private transfers during the crisis. Second, lager housuholds that are poor but less vulnerable tended to receive more <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> and households with more elderly that are poor and more vulnerable tended to receive more private and <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> during the cirsis. Third, female-headed households that are poor but not vulnerable tended to receive more private and <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> while urban hoseholds that are not poor but more vulnerable received relatively less private and <b>public</b> <b>transfers.</b> Finally, we find that only poor Korean households were well protected by both inter-household transfers and bovernment transfers during the crisis and there had been a strong crowding-out relation between private and <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> throughout the period. This suggests that the Korean government should reconsider its targeting scheme in order to assist not only the poor but also the vulnerable and to prevent crowding-out effects of its social safety net programs.

40|$|The intergenerational {{impact of}} <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> on the {{economic}} and social outcome in a society is discussed ambiguously. A considerable amount of research generally found that parental welfare participation may encourage the welfare dependency of future generations and thus perpetuate generational poverty cycles (Gottschalk 1992, Vartanian 1999, Pepper 2000, Page 2004). <b>Public</b> <b>transfers</b> prevent persons from developing their resources or to take advantage of existing opportunities. Human capital such as education and work experience is not valued, and there is little motivation to pursue full-time employment (Hill and Duncan 1987, Mayer 1997, Corak and Heisz 1999). At the other side <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> are said to result in an overall improvement in the living standards of the poor (Ellwood and Summers 1986). In this view, <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> and redistributive taxes might be dedicated to narrow the gap between the income of the parents so that the incomes of the children converge to the mean more quickly (Corak 2006). The paper aims to analyze the implications of <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> on the intergenerational income inequality and poverty trends in Germany and the United States, two countries differing concerning welfare policy regimes, labor market settings and family role models. We analyze the pre- and post-government income of parent-child pairs in different time windows to address to non-linearities in the intergenerational income mobility (Hyson 2003...|$|E

Cross-country differences in the process of transition are also found to be significant. A relatively large non-agriculture self-employment sector is non-equalising in rural China, but is also narrowing the urban to rural income gap.

40|$|The {{empirical}} retirement literature measures individual {{responses to}} variation in income flows due to <b>public</b> <b>transfers,</b> private individual or employer-provided pensions. The novelty {{of this paper}} is to provide a decomposition the incentive effects from these three sources. It is the first time that the effects of pay policies of different employers on retirement outcomes is explicitly modelled and empirically measured. A model of individual retirement is set up where employers may influence worker retirement age through pay policy. A conventional dynamic structural model is extended to allow both individual and employer heterogeneity. Empirically, identification of the employer effects on income and retirement is achieved by exploiting a longitudinal sample of Danish small-to-medium sized private sector establishments matched together with all of their workers. Identification of the effect of <b>public</b> <b>transfers</b> on income and retirement is through exogenous eligibility rules and reforms to a public early retirement programme. Employer specific compensation is found to be an important determinant of work and retirement income flows.

In both the short and the long run the employment rates for the injured men are significantly lower than for non-injured persons. No effects on the employment rate are found for women.
