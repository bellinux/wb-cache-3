Offshore, the Portuguese bark Propheta, with a cargo of timber worth $5,000, was badly damaged. Strong winds up to [...] were observed in the Mobile area of Alabama, uprooting trees, unroofing houses, and toppling chimneys. Tides inundated the cotton exchange with up to [...] of water, while the Western Union, post office, and electrical house for railroads were also flooded. The <b>pleasure</b> <b>yacht</b> Ariel, which was bound for the Fish River, was smashed into pieces at a wharf along {{the eastern end of}} Mobile Bay. Between 12 and 15 schooners from the F. F. Saunders company fishing fleet were badly damaged; four of which sank, resulting in $70,000 in damage. However, due to warnings by the Weather Bureau, the Chamber of Commerce estimated that several millions of dollars in damage was evaded. All towns along the coast of Mississippi [...] "suffered seriously".|$|E

Three fully furnished saloons were also provided, complete with imported carpets, curtains and hangings, and decorated with mirrors. The state rooms were large and comfortable and the interior has been described as more closely resembling a <b>pleasure</b> <b>yacht</b> than a steam packet.|$|E

2500|$|Point Highland {{transferred}} to Chincoteague, Virginia, in April 1981. She made her first drug bust {{later that year}} on 24 October when she seized a [...] <b>pleasure</b> <b>yacht</b> on the Chesapeake Bay that was smuggling 10 tons of marijuana. During a winter storm in February, 1983, the cutter was called out to assist the disabled fishing vessel Theodora. At the same time, 30 miles east of Chincoteague, the 605-foot coal freighter Marine Electric reported that she was taking on water. After escorting the Theodora to Chincoteague Inlet, Point Highland raced to answer the Marine Electrics distress call. Battling 30-foot seas, 40 knot winds, and below-freezing temperatures, she arrived on scene and began what {{proved to be a}} futile search for survivors. Point Highland then recovered 17 bodies. She was awarded her second Unit Commendation for these actions.|$|E
2500|$|In 1963 {{a replica}} of Bluenose was built at Lunenburg using the {{original}} Bluenose plans and named Bluenose II. The replica was built by Smith and Rhuland, sponsored by the Oland Company. Used as a marketing tool for Oland Brewery Schooner Lager beer brand and as a <b>pleasure</b> <b>yacht</b> for the Olands family. Bluenose II was sold {{to the government of}} Nova Scotia in 1971 for the sum of $1 or 10 Canadian dimes. The replica schooner is used for tourism promotion as a [...] "sailing ambassador". In honour of her predecessor's racing record, Bluenose II does not officially race. The replica has undergone several refits to extend her life. This vessel was decommissioned and dismantled in 2010, and an entirely new Bluenose (also named Bluenose II, since Transport Canada deemed it a [...] "reconstruction") was built as close to the original schooner deemed necessary and launched in Lunenburg in 2013. Various subcomponents for this Bluenose II project were supplied from notable firms including the ships keel at Snyder's Shipyard in Dayspring, the ships backbone of laminated ribs at Covey Island Boatworks in Riverport and assembly of the vessel in Lunenburg. The vessel is currently tied up at the Lunenburg Foundry wharf in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. Much controversy has surrounded the vessel due to over spending on the [...] "refit" [...] and falsified documents. After further repairs ownership of the restored Bluenose II was returned to the province of Nova Scotia and she began a tour of Nova Scotia ports in the summer of 2015.|$|E

In sediments collected from the marinas located {{in the area of the}} Brave Vistula River Channel BT concentrations ranged between 10 to 15000 ng Sn/g dry wt. with a mean values between 500 and 5500 ng Sn/g, and the innermost sites of each of four marinas were the most polluted.

The <b>pleasure</b> <b>yachts</b> are identified as the main source of BT pollution of sediment and fish.
