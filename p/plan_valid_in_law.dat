40|$|Several {{changes have}} {{occurred}} in South Africa within the customary law system to ensure gender justice, including {{the enactment of the}} Recognition of Customary Marriages Act 120 of 1998. The purpose of the Recognition Act is to recognise customary marriages as <b>valid</b> <b>in</b> <b>law</b> with equal status and capacity within the marriage for the parties to the marriage, and to regulate customary marriages. This has brought about changes to this social institution in an arena that is steeped in tradition and deep-rooted cultural practice. In 2013 the Constitutional Court in the Mayelane case developed the Xitsonga customary law to include the requirement of the consent of the first wife prior to her husband's taking another wife.

The autobiography tells of how Maria, like her aunt and namesake the duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, felt that she had married beneath herself in marrying a younger son of the king of Sweden, and this caused problems of ego between the couple. Maria insisted that the servants address her by her correct style Your Imperial and Royal Highness, {{to the chagrin of}} her husband, who was merely a Royal Highness. When apprised of the matter, Wilhelm's father King Gustav V {{had no choice but to}} acquiesce with his daughter-in-law's wish, which was perfectly <b>valid</b> <b>in</b> <b>law,</b> and order that the imperial style be used invariably for Maria. Nor was this all. Maria also made her husband feel sexually inadequate. In later years, she would tell people that her husband was a homosexual, or at least sexually inadequate.

He used these facts to justify a ruling that custodial sentences were not appropriate for cases of consensual private sodomy. Significantly, he also wrote: [...] "The aforegoing suggests broad consensus on eliminating discrimination against homosexuality and the likelihood that this will be entrenched in a new constitutional dispensation.

60|$|As to the {{coronation}} oath, {{to which you}} allude, as opposite to admitting a Roman Catholic {{to the use of}} any franchise whatsoever, I cannot think that the king would be perjured, if he gave his assent to any regulation which Parliament might think fit to make with regard to that affair. The king is bound by law, as clearly specified in several acts of Parliament, to be in communion with the Church of England. It {{is a part of the}} tenure by which he holds his crown; and though no provision was made till the Revolution, which could be called positive and <b>valid</b> <b>in</b> <b>law,</b> to ascertain this great principle, I have always considered it as in fact fundamental, that the king of England should be of the Christian religion, according to the national legal church for the time being. I conceive it was so before the Reformation. Since the Reformation it became doubly necessary; because the king is the head of that church, in some sort an ecclesiastical person,--and it would be incongruous and absurd to have the head of the Church of one faith, and the members of another. The king may inherit the crown as a Protestant; but he cannot hold it, according to law, without being a Protestant of the Church of England.|$|R
50|$|Following Edward’s death, Walter {{engaged in}} a bitter quarrel over his {{inheritance}} with his mother, Catherine. The source of their dispute was an agreement made in 1601. As a widow Catherine was to retain possession of Castle Bromwich during her lifetime. In return, she was to pay her son an annual rent of £40; allow him to occupy a designated suite of rooms in the manor house if he wished; and grant him the right to receive the profits of timber on the estate. These arrangements, which had seemed acceptable when they were made, were now regarded by Walter Devereux as distinctly unattractive. Lady Catherine had already been well provided for, both by her husband, Edward, and the 1st Viscount Hereford; between them they had granted her a jointure estate worth £400 p.a. Her lease of Castle Bromwich gave her an additional £120 a year in clear profit. All told, Walter complained, Catherine’s landed income was now of a greater yearly value than the lands and tenements he had as heir of his father. Catherine responded to these complaints in February 1623 by accusing her son in Chancery of making Castle Bromwich the subject of secret conveyances, and of refusing to allow her half the interest on loans made by Sir Edward during his lifetime. As Sir Edward had £21,000 out on loan at his death, the sum involved was substantial. Unfortunately for Walter Devereux, the 1601 lease was <b>valid</b> <b>in</b> <b>law,</b> and consequently Catherine retained Castle Bromwich {{and most of its}} contents until her death in 1627.|$|R

The Act has a geographical aspect {{in addition to}} the other aspects which have to be examined. Thereby, in this study, # 6360 was analyzed in terms of administrative geography. The scope of the research is the administrative geography analysis of the metropolitan municipality in Turkey between the years of 1984 – 2012. This study will make up the deficiencies on the local government systems of the metropolitan municipalities in Turkey, and the geographical basics, aspects and the problems of the system. On the contrary to the law, Antakya's, which is the central district of Hatay, not being a newly established county, but being turned into a metropolitan sub-provincial municipality; the use of certain authority of the governor and some rights, authority and charges of the special provincial administrators by the ‘Investment, monitoring and coordination committee’; metropolitan and sub- provincial municipalities’ being allowed to serve in all kinds of ways in the purpose of supporting agriculture and livestock, are just one part of the findings contrary to the common knowledge. Metropolitan municipality which is defined by the act, is basically neither a settlement with the distinguishing features of a city, nor an organization which is in charge of providing public and municipal services in the center of population. It is an administrative zone, having administrative and financial autonomy which is <b>valid</b> <b>in</b> <b>law.</b> However, <b>in</b> approximately the last 30 years, the present metropolitan municipalities have shown that they are not properly structured institutions for serving wide rural areas that are extending to the provincial borders...|$|R

But if the natural resources of this country belong {{to the people of the}} United States, those of Mexico belong to the people of Mexico. It makes no difference how [...] "lazy," [...] ignorant, and indifferent to their own interests the Mexicans at present may be. And even more important in these liberal campaigns was the issue of the conservation of human resources--men and women and children who are forced by necessity to labour. These must be protected in health, given economic freedom and a just reward for their toil. The American democracy, committed to the principle of the conservation of domestic natural and human resources, could not without detriment to itself persist in a foreign policy that ignored them. For many years our own government had permitted the squandering of these resources by adventurous capitalists; and gradually, as we became a rich industrial nation, these capitalists sought profitable investments for their increasing surplus in foreign lands. Their manner of acquiring [...] "concessions" [...] in Mexico was quite similar to that by which they had seized because of the indifference and ignorance of our own people--our own mines and timber lands which our government held in trust. Sometimes these American [...] "concessions" [...] have been <b>valid</b> <b>in</b> <b>law</b> though the law itself violated a democratic principle; more often corrupt officials winked at violations of the law, enabling capitalists to absorb bogus claims.|$|R
