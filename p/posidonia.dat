In Shark Bay, Western Australia, juvenile milk sharks inhabit seagrass meadows composed of Amphibolis antarctica and <b>Posidonia</b> australis. Although some sources state this species avoids low salinities, it has been reported several times from fresh water in Cambodia, as far upstream as the Tonlé Sap. Milk sharks may be found anywhere in the water column from the surface to the bottom. Off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, its numbers fluctuate annually with a peak in summer, suggesting some form of seasonal movement.|$|E

The <b>Posidonia</b> Shale is {{composed}} of black bituminous shales with intercalated bituminous limestone.

25|$|Albert Oppel {{reported}} {{the discovery of}} a pterosaur lower jaw from the <b>Posidonia</b> shales of Holzmaden. This was the first pterosaur specimen to be reported from these deposits, which would go on to produce many pterosaur fossils of exceptional quality.|$|E
25|$|The Black Jurassic is {{so called}} {{due to the}} dark colours of clay and marl {{characteristic}} of this era. This layer is approximately 50m thick and forms the fertile hilly area around the mountain. Its lowest sub-layers (Lias alpha to gamma) are beneath the surface. The Amaltheenton (Lias delta)at 35m is the thickest sub-layer of the Lias. A special feature is the <b>Posidonia</b> schist (Lias epsilon), which is 10m thick. In this sub-layer fossils from larger animals are also found such as ichthyosaurs. The cavity of the <b>Posidonia</b> schist, {{which is at the}} starting point of the nature trail, is a unique natural geological monument where it is prohibited to search for and to collect fossils. Above these well visible schist layers lies the Jurassic marl (Lias zeta), which is 2.7m thick.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{distinct}} difference in habitat between the adult and juvenile fish, with the juveniles more inclined to inhabit shallower waters in protected bays, creeks and estuaries. A favourite habitat of young fish appears to be Zostera and <b>Posidonia</b> seagrass beds in protected bays, apparently using the seagrass as protection and for foraging purposes.|$|E
25|$|Beds of {{the algae}} {{typically}} inhabit polluted, nutrient-rich {{areas such as}} sewage outfalls, explaining its spread among port cities in the Mediterranean Sea. This actually reduces the pollution in those areas, as the caulerpa consumes it: In an eight-year study of Caulerpa beds in the French Bay of Menton, {{it was found that}} the alga reduced pollution and aided in the recovery of native <b>Posidonia</b> seagrass.|$|E
25|$|The grey {{mangroves}} are uniformly of {{the type}} Avicennia marina var. resinifera and cover most of the pre-settlement area, but the surrounding samphire salt flats have been greatly reduced in size by changes in the landform with Tecticornia flabelliformis now listed as threatened in the area. The inlet's deeper sections are dominated by strap or tape weed (<b>Posidonia</b> spp.). Eelgrass (Zostera muelleri) and garweed (Heterozostera tasmanica) dominate the shallows, often being exposed on mudflats at low tide.|$|E

25|$|Testimony {{of intense}} {{cultural}} exchanges with the Greeks {{have been found}} in 1969 at the sanctuary of the port of Gravisca near Tarquinia. Renard thinks the cult of Hera in great emporia such as Croton, <b>Posidonia,</b> Pyrgi might be a counter to Aphrodite's, linked to sacred prostitution in ports, as the sovereign of legitimate of marriage and family and of their sacrality. Hera's presence had already been attested at Caere in the sanctuary of Manganello. In the 18th century a dedication to Iuno Historia was discovered at Castrum Novum (Santa Marinella). The cult of Iuno and Hera is generally attested in Etruria.|$|E
25|$|The area {{of what is}} now Salerno {{has been}} {{continuously}} settled since pre-historical times, although the first certain signs of human presence date to the period between the 9th and 6th centuries BC. We know the Oscan-Etruscan city of Irna (founded in the 6th century BC), situated across the Irno river, in what is today the quarter of Fratte. This settlement represented an important base for Etruscan trade with the Greek colonies of <b>Posidonia</b> and Elea. It was occupied by the Samnites around the 5th century BC as consequence of the Battle of Cumae (474 BC) as part of the Syracusan sphere of influence.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, {{from the}} German <b>Posidonia</b> Shale the {{discovery}} was reported of 182.7 {{million years old}} vertebrae of Stenopterygius in a carbonate nodule, still containing collagen fibers, cholesterol, platelets and red and white blood cells. The structures {{would not have been}} petrified but represent the original organic tissues of which the biomolecules could be identified. The exceptional preservation was explained by the protective environment offered by the nodule. The red blood cells found, were four to five times smaller than those of modern mammals. This would have been an adaptation for an improved oxygen absorption, also in view of the low oxygen levels during the Toarcian. The cholesterol had a high carbon 13 isotope component which might indicate a higher position in the food chain and a diet of fish and cephalopods.|$|E
25|$|During the ninteenth century, {{the number}} of {{described}} ichthyosaur genera gradually increased. New finds allowed for {{a better understanding of}} their anatomy. Owen had noted that many fossils showed a downward bend in the rear tail. At first, he explained this as a post mortem effect, a tendon pulling the tail end downwards after death. However, after an article on the subject by Philip Grey Egerton, Owen considered the possibility that the oblique section could have supported the lower lobe of a tail fin. This hypothesis was confirmed by new finds from Germany. In the <b>Posidonia</b> Shale at Holzmaden, dating from the early Jurassic, already in the early nineteenth century, the first ichthyosaur skeletons had been found. During {{the latter half of the}} century, the rate of discovery quickly increased to a few hundred each year. Ultimately, over four thousand were uncovered, forming the bulk of ichthyosaur specimens displayed today. The sites were also a Konservat-Lagerstätte, meaning not only the quantity, but also the quality was exceptional. The skeletons were very complete and often preserved soft tissues, including tail and dorsal fins. Additionally, female individuals were discovered with embryos.|$|E
