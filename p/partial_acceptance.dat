60|$|So {{there was}} violent action in politics, and violent and {{excessive}} stimulation in literature, {{the positive effects}} of the force moved in each sphere being deplorably small in proportion to the intense moral energy which gave the impulse. In literature the straining for mental liberty was the more futile of the two, because it expressed the ardent and hopeless longing of the individual for a life which we may perhaps best call life unconditioned. And this unconditioned life, which the Byronic hero vainly seeks, and not finding, he fills the world with stormy complaint, is least of all likely to offer itself in any approximate form to men penetrated with gross and egotistical passions to their inmost core. The Byronic hero went to clasp repose in a frenzy. All crimson and aflame with passion, he groaned for evening stillness. He insisted on being free, in the corroding fetters of resentment and scorn for men. Conrad sought balm for disappointment of spirit in vehement activity of body. Manfred represents the confusion common to the type, between thirst for the highest knowledge and proud violence of unbridled will. Harold is held in a middle way of poetic melancholy, equally far from a speechless despair and from gay and reckless licence, by contemplation of the loveliness of external nature, and the great exploits and perishing monuments of man in the past; but he, equally with the others, embodies the paradoxical hope that angry isolation and fretful estrangement from mankind are equivalent to emancipation from their pettiness, instead of being its very climax and demonstration. As if freedom of soul could exist without orderly relations of intelligence and <b>partial</b> <b>acceptance</b> between a man and the sum of surrounding circumstances. That universal protest which rings through Byron's work with a plangent resonance, very different from the whimperings of punier men, is a proof that so far from being free, one's whole being is invaded and laid waste. It is no ignoble mood, and it was a most inevitable product of the mental and social conditions of Western Europe {{at the close of the}} eighteenth century. Everlasting protest, impetuous energy of will, melancholy and despondent reaction;--this is the revolutionary course. Cain and Conrad; then Manfred and Lara and Harold.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies a finite-sized discrete-time two-class {{priority}} queue. Packets of both classes arrive {{according to}} a two-class discrete batch Markovian arrival process (2 -DBMAP), {{taking into account the}} correlated nature of arrivals in heterogeneous telecommunication networks. The model incorporates time and space priority to provide different types of service to each class. One of both classes receives absolute time priority in order to minimize its delay. Space priority is implemented by the <b>partial</b> buffer sharing <b>acceptance</b> policy and can be provided to the class receiving time priority or to the other class. This choice gives rise to two different queueing models and this paper analyses both these models in a unified manner. Furthermore, the buffer finiteness and the use of space priority raise some issues on the order of arrivals in a slot. This paper does not assume that all arrivals from one class enter the queue before those of the other class. Instead, a string representation for sequences of arriving packets and a probability measure on the set of such strings are introduced. This naturally gives rise to the notion of intra-slot space priority. Performance of these queueing systems is then determined using matrix-analytic techniques. The numerical examples explore the range of service differentiation covered by both models...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to discover which of socioeconomic factors or school input factors were more closely associated with written language achievement on the part of Grade Six students in a rural Newfoundland area. Complete data was secured and used for 361 boys and 323 girls. [...] Two measures of language achievement were selected. They were, the Canadian Tests of Basic Skills Language subtests and a paragraph writing test. Ten hypotheses were set up and tested. [...] The first hypothesis predicted sex differences in language achievement and that girls would achieve more highly than boys. This proved to be an acceptable hypothesis. Subsequent hypotheses were tested for boys and girls separately as well as for both groups combined. [...] The second hypothesis predicted that higher verbal intelligence would be associated with higher pupil language scores. This proved to be an acceptable hypothesis. Subsequent hypotheses were tested with the effects of intelligence controlled by the statistical technique of <b>partialing.</b> The <b>acceptance</b> of the first two hypotheses determined the format for testing and reporting the remainder. That is, the remaining hypotheses were tested for boys and girls separately and with intelligence statistically controlled. [...] Hypothesis 3 predicted that fathers' occupations would be positively associated with pupils' language achievement, and Hypothesis 4 predicted that mothers' education would be positively associated with pupils' language achievement. Both proved to be acceptable hypotheses for both sexes on both language measures until intelligence was partialled out. Then the significance disappeared. [...] Hypothesis 5 predicted that children from larger families would do less well on each of the language measures than children from smaller families. This proved to be true for the sub-group of girls and the whole group on the language skills measure, but not on the paragraph writing measure. With the effects of intelligence removed the significance disappeared. [...] Hypothesis 6 predicted that absenteeism would be negatively associated with pupils' language achievement, and Hypothesis 7 predicted that teachers' qualifications would be positively associated with pupils' language achievement. With the effects of intelligence removed, both hypotheses were rejected. [...] Hypothesis 8 predicted that class size would be positively associated with pupils' language achievement. This hypothesis was rejected for the sub-group of boys but accepted for the girls. Even with intelligence partialled out, the association was statistically significant. [...] Hypothesis 9 predicted that older school buildings would be associated with lower pupils' achievement in language. This hypothesis was rejected. However, {{it should be noted that}} the median age of the schools was only 13 years, and that only 24 per cent were over 20 years old. [...] The major part of the study concentrated on Hypothesis 10 which predicted that the socioeconomic factors of the pupils environment would be more closely associated with language achievement than the school input factors. This hypothesis was tested and accepted. An overall conclusion, therefore, of the study is that socioeconomic factors of the pupil's environment cannot be ignored by school authorities if they are genuinely interested in preparing programs that will provide the best learning opportunities for all their pupils. The quality of the education is not measured only in terms of school buildings, smaller classes and higher teachers' qualifications. A far greater impact on language achievement was found to be made by a child's family and home background...|$|R
40|$|This work {{examines}} the <b>partial</b> <b>acceptance</b> by the Western medical establishment of Therapeutic Touch {{as a form}} of medical treatment in Western orthodox medicine. The primary focus of this thesis is on how Dolores Krieger, founder of TT, was able to successfully introduce this healing practice into Western medical establishments such as nursing schools, medical clinics, and hospitals, despite its basis in Eastern philosophical, metaphysical, and medical concepts such as prana, ch'i, chakras, and the theory of yin-yang. Therapeutic Touch emphasizes the concept of "human energy" transference, an idea borrowed from Eastern belief systems that suggest that humans are energy systems, interconnected with all things in the cosmos. Within Indian cultural context, for example, the concept of "human energy" has historically been known as prana. Within the cultural context of China, the term ch'i has been used to refer to human energy systems. Krieger borrows these concepts of "energy" to explain her own system of healing. By examining and comparing the work of Dolores Krieger with these Eastern concepts in their historical, philosophical and spiritual contexts, this work will illustrate how Dolores Krieger minimized, Westernized, and medicalized these concepts in order for the practice of Therapeutic Touch to gain <b>partial</b> <b>acceptance</b> in the field of Western, allopathic medicine...|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} chapter, I examine in a controlled, {{experimental}} laboratory setting, {{the acceptance of}} a secondary currency when a primary currency already circulates in an economy. The underlying model is an indivisible good / indivisible money, dual currency search model {{similar to that in}} Kiyotaki and Wright (1993) and Craig and Waller (2000). In such models, there are two pure Nash equilibria - total acceptance or total rejection of the secondary currency - and one unstable, mixed equilibrium denoted as <b>partial</b> <b>acceptance.</b> This mixed equilibrium is considered an artifact of the indivisibility of money and goods in the model and is often ignored. I find that when barter between good holders is allowed, the equilibrium tends towards total rejection. Conversely, when barter is prohibited, the equilibrium tends towards total acceptance. However, in both cases, the economies as a whole display <b>partial</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the secondary currency. In the second chapter, I continue this exploration of secondary currency acceptance using agent-based models. In particular, the models employ genetic algorithms for agent learning. The results in many ways coincide with those of the laboratory experiments, though under certain parameter settings, the economies simulated in the agent-based models often converge to complete acceptance or rejection of the secondary currency. In the third chapter, I change focus and examine the impact of foreign government purchases of U. S. Treasury securities on U. S. interest rates. While several past studies have considered the impact of such flows on U. S. long-term interest rates, few, if any, have simultaneously included Federal Reserve purchases of Treasury securities. Therefore, I undertake an empirical analysis that includes both types of purchases, particularly relevant given the Fed's recent large-scale asset purchase program, and have included updated data through April 2014. I find that both foreign government and Federal Reserve Treasury purchases {{had a significant impact on}} medium and long-term yields...|$|E
