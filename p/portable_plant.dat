50|$|The mine {{workings}} are located immediately {{on top of}} a steep bank overlooking a creek. They comprise an open-cut shaft or collapsed stope with a drive extending along the strike of the reef which is about 8m in depth. A mullock dump descends from the shaft to the creek bed. A portable engine and a portable boiler are aligned to the {{mine workings}}. The boiler is a wet bottom type constructed with early conical pointed rivets and possibly manufactured in the United States. Remnants of a stone mount for a Cornish boiler, located alongside the <b>portable</b> <b>plant,</b> are also aligned towards the mine. A Cornish boiler, which was still on site (though not in situ) in the mid 1970s, has since been removed. South of the machinery area is a rock scatter associated with a stone and mud mortar flue and chimney base, which may have also been foundations for a second Cornish boiler. Further south is an iron lined assay furnace of stone construction, and a small top-fed retort kiln. There is no definite evidence of a battery, such as discarded stamps, cams or tailings. The only likely battery foundations are two short vertical iron bolts, 1.6m apart, aligned with the portable engine. However these were more likely tension bolts for an engine or winch. An extensive area on the opposite bank of the creek extending west to the main road has been subjected to recent tree clearance and surface bulldozing. If a battery was located {{on the west side of}} Sandy Creek then all evidence of foundations and dumps would have been lost.|$|E

40|$|The high-shear {{colloidal}} mixer, pioneered over 60 years ago, is {{internationally recognized}} as the most efficient method of mixing cement based grouts. Only recently, however, has this technology been applied {{to the production of}} cemented rockfill (CRF) for use in underground mines in North America. Traditionally, paddle type mixers have been used to produce the cement based slurries required for the preparation of cemented rockfills. While considerable success has been achieved with these mixers, tremendous advantages are attained with the colloidal mixer. The combined effect of the highly efficient mixing action and the ability to mix low water/solids ratios allows for reductions in the cement content for a given strength requirement. Cement can also be replaced by cheaper fillers such as flyash or PFA resulting in significant cost savings. Although large scale dedicated CRF plants are typical, there is a growing need for mobile plants capable of operating anywhere underground. The compact size and rapid batching speed of the high-shear colloidal mixers has allowed them to be incorporated into skid mounted systems capable of producing and discharging cement based slurries onto rockfill aggregate for the production of CRF. In many cases run-of-mine development waste can be taken directly to a <b>portable</b> <b>plant</b> located near the dumping face and used as CRF aggregate thereby eliminating the cost of waste removal...|$|E
40|$|Spathiphyllum spp. es conocida comúnmente como cuna de moisés, se utiliza como planta ornamental, presenta una hoja modificada (espata), de color blanco, y {{conforme}} madura enverdece. Este fenómeno típico de algunas Aráceas es poco conocido. En el presente trabajo se analizaron algunos parámetros que intervienen en el enverdecimiento. Para clasificar el enverdecimiento la clorofila se midió con un medidor portátil (SPAD-meter 50), se delimitaron tres etapas en unidades relativas “SPAD”; E 1 con 5 a 10, E 2 de 15 a 20 y E 3 de 25 a 30, como referencia se usaron espatas blancas (B) y hojas del follaje (V) con un rango de 35 a 46 unidades relativas. El contenido de clorofila total en las hojas del follaje (2. 99 gChlmg- 1 PF) fue el doble que en E 3 (1. 07 gChlmg- 1 PF). En las espatas blancas la concentración fue 0. 02 gChlmg- 1 PF, y se detectó la clorofila en las células oclusivas de los estomas. La proteína soluble total incrementó en E 3 (19. 78 mgg- 1 PF), y fue mayor que en el follaje (10. 59 mgg- 1 PF). La subunidad grande de la Rubisco (LSU) en la espata E 3 representó 9. 28 ODUmm- 2, valor similar al de las hojas del follaje 8. 58 ODUmm- 2. También se midieron in situ los parámetros de la fluorescencia (fluorescencia inicial Fo, variable Fv, máxima Fm, y su relación Fv/Fm) de la clorofila a en la espata durante su enverdecimiento, con un analizador portátil de la fluorescencia (Plant Efficiency Analyser, PEA). Con el enverdecimiento aumentaron los valores de fluorescencia esto se atribuye al incremento de la actividad fotosintética. La espata B presentó relación Fv/Fm de 0. 300, mientras que la E 3 presentó 0. 700, similar al follaje con 0. 700 a 0. 800. El enverdecimiento se asocia con el aumento de pigmentos fotosintéticos, en proporciones mayores de clorofila a. El incremento los pigmentos, subunidad gran de Rubisco (LSU) y fluorescencia durante las diferentes etapas de enverdecimiento indican la reactivación de la actividad fotosintética que podría intervenir en la producción de fotosintatos para el desarrollo de la inflorescencia. _________Spathiphyllum wallisii R. {{is used as}} an ornamental plant; it has {{a modified}} leaf or hypsophyll called “spath”. The spath it white but when it matures gets green. Greening is a typical phenomenon of some Araceas, but little it is known. In this work, some parameters {{that take place in}} greening were analyzed. The greening was quantified with a portable measurer (SPAD-meter 50), this instrument measures the relative "green" provided by the chlorophyll. Three stages in relative units were delimited from this data SPAD" (G 1 with 5 to 10, G 2 15 to 20 and G 3 25 to 30), white spathes (W) (≤ 1 SPAD units and foliage leaves (F) with a rank of 35 to 46 SPAD unit; they were used as a manner of reference. The total chlorophyll content in the foliage leaves (2. 99 gChlmg- 1 FW) was the double that in E 3 (1. 07 gChlmg- 1 FW). In the white spathes the concentration was 0. 02 gChlmg- 1 FW, the chlorophyll was detected in guard cells of the stomata. The total soluble protein increased in E 3 (19. 78 mgg- 1 FW), this was major that in foliage leaves (10. 59 mgg- 1 FW). The LSU of Rubisco in spath E 3 presented 9. 28 ODUmm- 2 a similar value to the foliage leaves 8. 58 ODUmm- 2. The green fluorescence (initial fluorescence Fo, variable Fv, maximal Fm, and Fv/Fm relation), of clorophyll a, analized in situ, using a <b>portable</b> <b>Plant</b> Efficiency Analyser (PEA). The values of fluorescence increased with the greening, suggesting photosynthetic activity. The relation Fv/Fm in white spathes (W) was 0. 300, whereas in the E 3 the relation was 0. 700 similar to the foliage leaves with 0. 700 to 0. 800. The greening is associated with the increase of photosynthetic pigments and activity, in larger chlorophyll a proportions. The moderate increase of the pigments, the significant accumulation of LSU Rubisco and more fluorescence during greening maybe indicates the reactivation of the photosynthesis and the production of photosyntates needed {{for the development of the}} inflorescence...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{power system}} and {{transportation}} sector are our planet’s {{main sources of}} greenhouse gas emissions. Renewable energy sources (RESs), mainly wind and solar, can reduce emissions from the electric energy sector; however, they are very intermittent. Likewise, next generation plug-in vehicles, which include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid capability, referred to as gridable vehicles (GVs) by the authors, can reduce emissions from the transportation sector. GVs {{can be used as}} loads, energy sources (small <b>portable</b> power <b>plants)</b> and energy storage units in a smart grid integrated with renewable energy sources. However, uncertainty surrounds the controllability of GVs. Forecasted load is used in unit commit-ment (UC); however, the actual load usually differs from the fore-casted one.
