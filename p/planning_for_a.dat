5|$|Highway27 was {{designated}} as a two lane road travelling north from Highway2 (Lake Shore Boulevard) towards Barrie. As Toronto grew outwards following the annexation of various municipalities, the Ontario Department of Highways (DHO) began <b>planning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bypass of the city, aptly named the Toronto Bypass. A significant portion of this bypass {{was designed to be}} incorporated into the Transprovincial Highway, now Highway401. The remainder was designed to follow the existing right-of-way of Highway27 between the QEW and Richview Sideroad (now Eglinton Avenue).|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Alton Towers {{added the}} Thunder Looper roller coaster; the {{addition}} was only temporary due to planning restrictions imposed on its installation.

5|$|<b>Planning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{new design}} {{to replace the}} RAN's Oberon-class {{submarines}} {{began in the late}} 1970s and early 1980s. Proposals were received from seven companies; two were selected for a funded study to determine the winning design, which was announced in mid-1987. The submarines, enlarged versions of Swedish shipbuilder Kockums' Västergötland class and originally referred to as the Type 471, were constructed between 1990 and 2003 in South Australia by the Australian Submarine Corporation (ASC).|$|E
5|$|Population and {{commercial}} activity grew rapidly after India gained independence in August 1947. The only link across the Hooghly River, the Howrah Bridge, between Howrah and Kolkata, {{was subject to}} much traffic congestion, with over 85,000 vehicles every day. This necessitated <b>planning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new bridge across the river {{so that it could}} connect to the major cities of Mumbai (Bombay), Delhi and Chennai (Madras) through the national highways located close to the bridge.|$|E
5|$|While Old Coast Road's dual {{carriageway}} was advancing north from Bunbury, and Kwinana Freeway was progressively being extended south from Perth, the alignment through Mandurah was constrained by existing development. Keeping the existing alignment {{would result in}} a traffic bottleneck through Mandurah. To overcome this problem, Main Roads began <b>planning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new route east of the Peel Inlet in the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|A {{railroad}} link to JFK Airport {{had been}} proposed since 1968 {{as part of}} the Program for Action, but was not actually implemented for almost three decades. From the 1970s to the early 1990s, various plans surfaced to try to build such a link. Meanwhile, the JFK Express subway service and shuttle buses provided an unpopular transport system to and around JFK. There were 21 failed proposals for rail links to New York City airports during this time. Serious <b>planning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> dedicated transport system at JFK began in 1990. An environmental impact statement for a JFK light-rail system was released in 1997, and the current people-mover system started construction a year later. AirTrain JFK opened on December 17, 2003, despite being the subject of several lawsuits during construction and a death during one of the system's test runs.|$|E
5|$|Commercial diving {{operations}} may {{expose the}} diver to more and sometimes greater hazards than recreational diving, but the associated occupational {{health and safety}} legislation is less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, may be prepared to accept. Commercial diving operations are also constrained by the physical realities of the operating environment, and expensive engineering solutions are often necessary to control risk. A formal hazard identification and risk assessment is a standard and required part of the <b>planning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> commercial diving operation, and this is also the case for offshore diving operations. The occupation is inherently hazardous, and great effort and expense are routinely incurred to keep the risk within an acceptable range. The standard methods of reducing risk are followed where possible.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{positive}} response the film received at the Telluride Film Festival, Paramount intended to move Up in the Air {{from its original}} release date of December 4, 2009, <b>planning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> November 13 limited release going wide before the Thanksgiving holiday. However, this schedule conflicted {{with the release of}} The Men Who Stare at Goats, another Clooney film. The film was eventually released on December 4 in fifteen theaters spanning twelve markets, broadening in the next week to 72 theaters and going into wide release on December 23, 2009. It was released in other countries beginning in early 2010.|$|E

5|$|In 1970, the ferries were {{equipped}} with televisions. The following year, {{the company had}} a deficit of NOK1.1 million. It transported 195,000 passengers, of which 120,000 took the Vangshylla–Kjerringvik service. Mobile telephones came into use in January 1972. In 1973, the service was reduced {{as a result of}} the oil crisis, which lasted until 1 March 1974. Smoking indoors was banned from 1975, and a new quay was built in Levanger and opened on 1 July 1976. Local disagreement about the location of a new quay on Ytterøy delayed construction, and it did not open until 1981. In 1974, <b>planning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new ferry on the Ytterøy service started, although the order was not placed until June 1979. The new ferry, Ytterøy, cost NOK10.5 million, had space for 30 cars and was bi-directional. It was put into service in February 1981. Innherredsferja II was kept as a reserve.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, Obama asked Lu {{to begin}} <b>planning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{possible}} presidential transition. Obama warned {{him to tell}} no one about the nascent operation, even his own wife, so Lu quietly rented a small office in D.C. and secretly met with people who had worked on previous Democratic presidential transition efforts. The planning efforts produced policy options {{on a wide range}} of topics, compiled names of and began vetting potential political appointees for top jobs, arranged over 100 security clearances, and managed the logistics for expanding the operations after Election Day.|$|E
5|$|Jamaica–179th Street {{was opened}} on December 11, 1950, {{although}} it had been planned to be built at 178th Street as early as 1928. At the time, the Queens Boulevard Line {{was part of the}} Independent Subway System (IND), but the original IND plans did not provide for constructing the 178th Street station until the line was extended even further to Queens Village. The line opened to 169th Street, the next station south, in 1937. Various changes in plans, as well as material shortages due to the Great Depression and World War II, delayed the project until 1946. Jamaica–179th Street became among Queens' busiest upon its 1950 opening. After a period of deterioration, the station was renovated twice, in the 1980s and the 2000s. As a result of <b>planning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> never-built expansion to Queens Village, the station has 8 storage tracks to its east, giving it the highest peak capacity of any New York City Subway station.|$|E

5|$|Nuclear waste {{policy in}} Germany is in flux. German <b>planning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{permanent}} geologic repository began in 1974, focused on salt dome Gorleben, a salt mine near Gorleben about 100 kilometers northeast of Braunschweig. The site {{was announced in}} 1977 with plans for a reprocessing plant, spent fuel management, and permanent disposal facilities at a single site. Plans for the reprocessing plant were dropped in 1979. In 2000, {{the federal government and}} utilities agreed to suspend underground investigations for three to ten years, and the government committed to ending its use of nuclear power, closing one reactor in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Piłsudski's PPS, {{while not}} <b>planning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> major {{uprising}} then and there, had {{a policy of}} supporting the protest and harassing Russian forces. The PPS, {{as well as other}} socialist organizations, such as Jewish Bund and SDKPiL, were as surprised by the scale of the spontaneous revolt as the Russian authorities; PPS forces in Łódź consisted of 10 regular and armed PPS members and a few dozen semi-enlisted workers. A larger group sent from Warsaw under Walery Sławek never made it in time to take control or affect the uprising; it was, in the end, an anarchic and unorganized violent protest against the Russian government.|$|E
5|$|<b>Planning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bypass around Northam {{began in}} the 1960s. The {{original}} route through the town centre functioned as both a local access road and primary traffic route, including for heavy vehicles. There were particular concerns {{with the amount of}} traffic congestion, frequency of crashes, and the noise and visual pollution of the highway's traffic. Twelve different alignments were considered for the bypass, which were narrowed down to three options by the 1990s. In 1993 the Environmental Protection Authority assessed the proposal, and found that only the route that deviated furthest away from the townsite would be environmentally acceptable. The closer routes were not acceptable due to the potential impact on the Avon River. The project gained the Minister for the Environment's conditional approval on 24 June 1994. Construction of the Northam bypass began in January 2001, with the new road opened on 17 May 2002.|$|E

5|$|The 10th Battalion {{underwent}} desert {{training in}} January and February 1915, {{during which time}} it was reorganised around the four-company structure that had been adopted by the British. Designated 'A' to 'D', each company consisted of 228 men that were spread across four platoons. In late February, the 3rd Brigade received orders that it was being committed to an operation in the Dardanelles and, after moving by rail to Alexandria, boarded Ionian, a Greek steamer, on 1 March. After reaching Lemnos, a shortage of fresh water on the island meant that the battalion was housed on the ship {{for the next seven}} weeks, although this was spent ashore conducting exercises and mounting guard duty. <b>Planning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula began in early April; while this proceeded, on 15 April the battalion was issued its distinctive blue and purple unit colour patch.|$|E
5|$|The close {{distance}} between Mill Point and Point Lewis {{at the foot}} of Mount Eliza meant the site was suggested as a suitable location for a bridge as early as 1849. A bridge was proposed for the site in 1899, but its expected cost of £13,000 was deemed too high. Preliminary <b>planning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bridge at the site finally began in 1947, but was suspended so that a replacement, The Causeway, could be built at Heirisson Island, at the city's eastern end. The new Causeway bridges were opened in 1952, and by 1954 traffic using them to enter the city had doubled, renewing calls for a bridge at The Narrows.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarines}} {{originally had}} a predicted operational life of around 30 years, with Collins to decommission around 2025.

In December 2007, shortly after the 2007 federal election, the Australian government announced that <b>planning</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Collins-class replacement (procurement project SEA 1000) had commenced. The 2009 Defending Australia in the Asia Pacific Century: Force 2030 white paper confirmed the replacement project, and announced that the submarine fleet would be increased to twelve vessels to sustain submarine operations in any conflict, and counter the growing potency of Asian-Pacific naval forces.|$|E
