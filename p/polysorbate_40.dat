40|$|The {{effects of}} {{selected}} nonionic emulsifiers on the physicochemical characteristics of astaxanthin nanodispersions produced by an emulsification/evaporation technique were studied. The emulsifiers used were polysorbates (Polysorbate 20, <b>Polysorbate</b> <b>40,</b> Polysorbate 60 and Polysorbate 80) and sucrose esters of fatty acids (sucrose laurate, palmitate, stearate and oleate). The mean particle diameters of the nanodispersions ranged from 70 nm to 150 nm, {{depending on the}} emulsifier used. In the prepared nanodispersions, the astaxanthin particle diameter decreased with increasing emulsifier hydrophilicity and decreasing carbon number of the fatty acid in the emulsifier structure. Astaxanthin nanodispersions with the smallest particle diameters were produced with Polysorbate 20 and sucrose laurate among the polysorbates and the sucrose esters, respectively. We {{also found that the}} Polysorbate 80 - and sucrose oleate-stabilized nanodispersions had the highest astaxanthin losses (i. e., the lowest astaxanthin contents in the final products) among the nanodispersions. This work demonstrated the importance of emulsifier type in determining the physicochemical characteristics of astaxanthin nano-dispersions...|$|E
40|$|A dynamic oscillatory {{technique}} {{was used to}} assess the effect of polysorbate non-ionic surfactants on mucus rheology. Adherent mucus gel was scraped from the surface mucosa of pig stomachs and purified by gel exclusion chromatography followed by ultrafiltration and gelation. Rheological measurements of this gel were carried out on a Carri-Med Controlled Stress Rheometer. Appropriate volumes of surfactant solution were added to weighed samples of mucus gel so that a final concentration of 20 mM surfactant was achieved in a gel containing 8 % w/w solids content. Polysorbate 20 (PS 20), <b>polysorbate</b> <b>40</b> (PS 40), polysorbate 60 (PS 60) and polysorbate 80 (PS 80) all decreased both storage (elastic) modulus G’ and loss (viscous) modulus G’’ significantly at 10 Hz (PPS 20 >PS 60 >PS 40. The mechanisms by which surfactants disturb the mucus structure are not fully understood, nonetheless, they could possibly affect the mucus gel properties by causing depletion of the glycoprotein constituents such as non-mucin proteins and mucin associated lipids. This might lead to the conclusion that polysorbates, by reducing the viscoelasticity of mucus gel could alleviate its barrier properties and facilitate the diffusion of concomitantly administered drugs via mucus gel...|$|E
40|$|A kinetically stable ultra-fine {{oil-water}} (o/w) emulsion containing Perphenazine and blends of {{long and}} medium chain triglycerides was prepared. The {{purpose of the}} ultra-fine emulsion was to increase the oral bioavailability of Perphenazine. The formulations were prepared using a low energy emulsification phase titration method. The optimized formulations consisted of blends of linseed oil and Sefsol 218 (1 : 1) (oil phase), <b>polysorbate</b> <b>40</b> (surfactant), polyethylene glycol 400 (cosurfactant) and distilled water (dispersion medium). Characterization of viscosity, refractive index, particle size distribution, spectral transmittance and surface morphology of the formulations was performed. The release rate of Perphenazine from the formulations was quantified using the everted gut sac of rat intestinal mucosa. The ex vivo release data demonstrated that the formulated nanoemulsions increased significantly the permeation rate of Perphenazine when compared with a suspension. Following oral administration of selected nanoemulsions in Wistar rats, the AUC and Cmax of Perphenazine increased by 2. 9 and 2. 54 -fold respectively compared with the Perphenazine suspension. The observed increase in bioavailability {{may be due to}} the increase in the dissolution rate from the molecularly dissolved drug in the oil phase and an increased rate of dispersion of the drug in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract which leads to greater absorption into the blood...|$|E
5000|$|Coating these {{polymeric}} nanoparticle devices {{with different}} surfactants can also aid BBB crossing and uptake in the brain. Surfactants such as <b>polysorbate</b> 80, 20, <b>40,</b> 60, and poloxamer 188, demonstrated positive drug delivery through the blood brain barrier, whereas other surfactants did not yield the same results. It {{has also been}} shown that functionalizing the surface of nanoparticles with polyethylene glycol (PEG), can induce the [...] "stealth effect", allowing the drug-loaded nanoparticle to circulate throughout the body for prolonged periods of time. Further, the stealth effect, caused in part by the hydrophilic and flexible properties of the PEG chains, facilitates an increase in localizing the drug at target sites in tissues and organs.|$|R
40|$|Não informadoThe acute edemagenic {{effect of}} four <b>polysorbates</b> (20, <b>40,</b> 60, and 80) was studied in Wistar rats, after {{subcutaneous}} injections in {{the sole of}} the hindlimbs. These substances induced a similar pattern of paw edema, that was throughly followed by pletismographic measurements during 7 hours, and eventually 48 hours. At the standardized experimental conditions, the highest used concentrations of the polysorbates induce about 600 to 900 microlitres of increased paw volume, the maximum being collected after approximately 90 minutes, although about 70 % of this could be already recorded 30 minutes from the injections. The edemas are strongly inhibited by dexametasone and by the ?H IND. 1 ?-histamine receptor antagonist terfenadine, but are little or not sensitive to inhibition by the nonsteroid anti-inflammatory agents indomethacin or aspirin. The polysorbates exhibit the phenomenon of counter irritation, that is; {{a high degree of}} inhibition of the edema volume can be observed when one of these substances is simultaneously injected in both hindpaws of the same animal. No quantitative correlation could be found out between the edemagenic responses to the polysorbates and the viscosity or the tensoactivity of the injected solution...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to enhance the {{solubility}} and stability of Acacia concinna extract by loading in a microemulsion for topical application. Both physical appearance and biological activities of the extract-loaded microemulsion were determined in comparison with the extract solution. Pseudoternary phase diagrams of three oil types including tea seed oil, grape seed oil, and sesame oil, together with polysorbate 85 or the mixture of polysorbate 85 and sorbitan oleate as surfactants, and absolute ethanol as a co-surfactant were constructed to optimize the microemulsion area. The selected microemulsion was then characterized for droplet size, polydispersity index, and viscosity. Tea seed oil exhibited the highest microemulsion area in the phase diagram because it had the highest unsaturated fatty acid content. The microemulsion composed of tea seed oil (5 %), <b>polysorbate</b> 85 (<b>40</b> %), ethanol (20 %), and water (35 %) exhibited Newtonian flow behavior with the droplet size and polydispersity index of 68. 03 [*]±[*] 1. 09 [*]nm and 0. 44 [*]±[*] 0. 04, respectively. After 4 % w/w of the extract was incorporated into the microemulsion, larger droplets size was observed (239. 77 [*]±[*] 12. 69 [*]nm) with a lower polydispersity index (0. 37 [*]±[*] 0. 02). After storage in various conditions, both physical appearances and the stability of biological activity of the extract-loaded microemulsion were improved compared to the solution. Therefore, the A. concinna loaded microemulsion may be a promising carrier for further development into a topical formulation and clinical trials for pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical applications are also suggested...|$|R
40|$|A highly {{sensitive}} and selective ratiometric sensor for the quantification of cyanide (CN) in aqueous samples {{has been developed}} using spherical gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) stabilized by <b>polysorbate</b> <b>40</b> (PS- 40). Three different AuNP sizes (14, 40 and 80  nm mean diameters) were {{used to evaluate the}} response of the sensor using both colorimetric and Resonance Rayleigh Scattering (RRS) detection schemes. The best results were obtained for the sensor using 40  nm AuNPs, for which the limits of detection (LODs) were found to be 100  nmol L in a benchtop instrument and 500  nmol L by the naked eye, values well below the maximum acceptable level for drinking water (1. 9  µmol L) set by the World Health Organization (WHO). The practical use of the 40  nm-AuNPs RRS sensor was demonstrated with the determination of CN in drinking and fresh waters. Finally, the sensor was successfully implemented in a compact portable device consisting of two light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and a miniature spectrometer, turning this sensor into a very potent tool for its application as a quick routine field-deployable analytical method.

40|$|A {{partially}} purified chlorophyllase, {{obtained from}} alga Phaeodactylum tricornutum, was assayed for its hydrolytic activity towards the pheophytin in ternary micellar systems of hexane/Tris-HCl/surfactant. A {{wide range of}} surfactants, sorbitans (Span 20, 40, 60, 80 and 85) and <b>polysorbates</b> (Tween 20, <b>40,</b> 60, 80 and 85), was used. The use of either 50 $ mu$M of Span 85 or 1 $ mu$M of Tween 80 increased the hydrolytic activity of chlorophyllase by 110 and 23 %, respectively. The optimum values of pH, enzyme content, incubation time and temperature for the hydrolytic activity of chlorophyllase were determined as 8. 25, 8 $ mu$g protein/ml, 60 min and 27. 5 $ sp circ$C, respectively. The enzyme was assayed for its hydrolytic activity in the most appropriate ternary system containing Span 85 with purified pheophytin, as well as chlorophyll derivatives, as substrates. Moreover, the values of $V sb{ rm max}/K sb{ rm m}$ ratio for chlorophyllase, using the partially purified pheophytin as substrate, in ternary systems with Span 85 and Tween 80 as surfactants, were 0. 15 and 0. 08, respectively; however, the value of $V sb{ rm max}/K sb{ rm m}$ ratio for the enzyme, in the ternary system with Span 85, using purified pheophytin as substrate was 0. 07. The addition of optimized amounts of individual membrane lipids, L-$ alpha$-phosphatidylcholine, L-$ alpha$-phosphatidyl-DL-glycerol and $ beta$-carotene increased the hydrolytic activity of chlorophyllase, using partially purified pheophytin as substrate, by 50, 36 and 10 %, respectively, for Span 85, and 30, 48 and 15 %, respectively, for Tween 80; in addition, these lipids increased the enzyme activity by 6, 23 and 31 %, respectively, in the Span 85 media, using purified pheophytin as substrate. Phytol showed a competitive inhibitory effect on chlorophyllase activity in both Span and Tween systems containing partially purified pheophytin substrate; however, phytol had an uncompetitive inhibitory effect on the enzyme activity in the...|$|R
