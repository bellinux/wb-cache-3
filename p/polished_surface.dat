5|$|Beyond the {{slowness}} {{of making}} a new mass standard and the poor reproducibility, there were other intrinsic shortcomings to the ionaccumulation approach {{that proved to be}} formidable obstacles to ion-accumulation-based techniques becoming a practical realization. The apparatus necessarily required that the deposition chamber have an integral balance system to enable the convenient calibration of a reasonable quantity of transfer standards relative to any single internal ion-deposited prototype. Furthermore, the mass prototypes produced by ion deposition techniques would have been nothing like the freestanding platinum-iridium prototypes currently in use; they would have been deposited onto—and become part of—an electrode imbedded into one pan of a special balance integrated into the device. Moreover, the ion-deposited mass wouldn't have had a hard, highly <b>polished</b> <b>surface</b> that can be vigorously cleaned like those of current prototypes. Gold, while dense and a noble metal (resistant to oxidation and the formation of other compounds), is extremely soft so an internal gold prototype would have to be kept well isolated and scrupulously clean to avoid contamination and the potential of wear from having to remove the contamination. Bismuth, which is an inexpensive metal used in low-temperature solders, slowly oxidizes when exposed to room-temperature air and forms other chemical compounds and so would not have produced stable reference masses unless it was continually maintained in a vacuum or inert atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|Bakelite's {{molding process}} {{had a number}} of advantages. Bakelite resin could be {{provided}} either as powder, or as preformed partially cured slugs, increasing the speed of the casting. Thermosetting resins such as Bakelite required heat and pressure during the molding cycle, but could be removed from the molding process without being cooled, again making the molding process faster. Also, because of the smooth <b>polished</b> <b>surface</b> that resulted, Bakelite objects required less finishing. Millions of parts could be duplicated quickly and relatively cheaply.|$|E

In 1791, Pierre Prévost showed that all bodies radiate heat, {{no matter how}} hot or cold they are. In 1804, Leslie observed that a matte black surface radiates heat more effectively than a <b>polished</b> <b>surface,</b> suggesting the importance of black body radiation. Though it had become to be suspected even from Scheele's work, in 1831 Macedonio Melloni demonstrated that black body radiation could be reflected, refracted and polarised {{in the same way}} as light.|$|E
25|$|Strong bases attack aluminium. Sodium {{hydroxide}} {{reacts with}} aluminium {{and water to}} release hydrogen gas. The aluminium takes the oxygen atom from sodium hydroxide, which in turn takes the oxygen atom from the water, and releases the two hydrogen atoms, The reaction thus produces hydrogen gas and sodium aluminate. In this reaction, sodium hydroxide acts as an agent to make the solution alkaline, which aluminium can dissolve in. This reaction {{can be useful in}} etching, removing anodizing, or converting a <b>polished</b> <b>surface</b> to a satin-like finish, but without further passivation such as anodizing or alodining the surface may become degraded, either under normal use or in severe atmospheric conditions.|$|E

2500|$|Polishing and buffing are {{finishing}} {{processes for}} smoothing a workpiece's surface using an abrasive and a work wheel or a leather [...] strop.

2500|$|Modern [...] "Terra sig" [...] {{should be}} clearly {{distinguished}} from the close reproductions of Roman wares made by some potters deliberately recreating and using the Roman methods. [...] The finish called 'terra sigillata' by studio potters {{can be made from}} most clay, mixed as a very thin liquid slip and settled to separate out only the finest particles to be used as terra sigillata. When applied to unfired clay surfaces, [...] "terra sig" [...] can be polished with a soft cloth or brush to achieve a shine ranging from a smooth silky lustre to a high gloss. The surface of ancient terra sigillata vessels did not require this burnishing or polishing. Burnishing was a technique used on some wares in the Roman period, but terra sigillata was not one of them.

2500|$|In 1648, Blaise Pascal rediscovered that {{atmospheric}} pressure decreases with height, and deduced {{that there is}} a vacuum above the atmosphere. In 1738, Daniel Bernoulli published Hydrodynamics, initiating the Kinetic theory of gases and established the basic laws for the theory of gases. In 1761, Joseph Black discovered that ice absorbs heat without changing its temperature when melting. In 1772, Black's student Daniel Rutherford discovered nitrogen, which he called phlogisticated air, and together they developed the phlogiston theory. In 1777, Antoine Lavoisier discovered oxygen and developed an explanation for combustion. In 1783, in Lavoisier's essay [...] "Reflexions sur le phlogistique", he deprecates the phlogiston theory and proposes a caloric theory. In 1804, Sir John Leslie observed that a matte black surface radiates heat more effectively than a <b>polished</b> <b>surface,</b> suggesting the importance of black body radiation. In 1808, John Dalton defended caloric theory in A New System of Chemistry and described how it combines with matter, especially gases; he proposed that the heat capacity of gases varies inversely with atomic weight. In 1824, Sadi Carnot analyzed the efficiency of steam engines using caloric theory; he developed the notion of a reversible process and, in postulating that no such thing exists in nature, laid the foundation for the second law of thermodynamics.|$|E
