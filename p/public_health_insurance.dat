40|$|Canadians often {{misunderstand}} {{the true}} cost of our <b>public</b> <b>health</b> care system. This oc-curs partly because Canadians do not incur direct expenses for their use of health care, and partly because Canadians cannot readily deter-mine the value of their contribution to <b>public</b> <b>health</b> care <b>insurance.</b> In 2015, the estimated average payment for <b>public</b> <b>health</b> care <b>insurance</b> ranges from $ 3, 789 to $ 12, 055 for six common Canadian family types, {{depending on the type of}} family.

As <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies play a highly relevant role in the German healthcare system, we conduct a comparative analysis.

25|$|In the {{political}} philosophy of healthcare, {{the debate between}} universal healthcare and private healthcare is particularly contentious in the United States. In the 1960s, there was a plethora of public initiatives {{by the federal government}} to consolidate and modernize the U.S. healthcare system. With Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, the U.S. established <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> for both senior citizens and the underprivileged. Known as Medicare and Medicaid, these two healthcare programs granted certain groups of Americans access to adequate healthcare services. Although these healthcare programs were a giant step in the direction of socialized medicine, many people think that the U.S. needs to do more for its citizenry with respect to healthcare coverage. Opponents of universal healthcare see it as an erosion of the high quality of care that already exists in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the {{province}}'s public health care program {{was not lost on}} the federal government. Another Saskatchewan politician, newly elected Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, decreed in 1958 that any province seeking to introduce a hospital plan would receive 50 cents on the dollar from the federal government. In 1962, Diefenbaker appointed Justice Emmett Hall—also of Saskatchewan, a noted jurist and Supreme Court Justice—to Chair a Royal Commission on the national health system—the Royal Commission on Health Services. In 1964, Justice Hall recommended a nationwide adoption of Saskatchewan's model of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> In 1966, the Liberal minority government of Lester B. Pearson created such a program, with the federal government paying 50% of the costs and the provinces the other half. So, the adoption of health care across Canada ended up being the work of three men with diverse political ideals - Tommy Douglas, John Diefenbaker and Lester Pearson.|$|E

In Switzerland, acupuncture has become the most frequently used alternative medicine since 2004. In the United Kingdom, a total of 4 million acupuncture treatments were administered in 2009.

Approximately half of users surveyed indicated a likelihood to seek such remedies in the future, while 37% did not.

30|$|One {{advantage}} of the direct <b>public</b> provision of <b>health</b> <b>insurance,</b> applied compulsorily to everyone, is that it avoids adverse selection by <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> customers. Adverse selection arises when individuals select insurance policies {{based in part on}} their personal health when their health is not fully reflected in premium differences. In other words, with many insurance products available, healthy individuals may tend to buy lower cost policies offering less coverage, such as plans with higher deductibles, coinsurance, or co-pays, since they do not expect to become ill. By contrast, persons in poor health may demand more complete coverage. Under <b>public</b> provision of <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> everyone is insured under the same terms, hence adverse selection is not an issue.|$|R
