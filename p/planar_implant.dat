40|$|Novel surface {{coatings}} of percutaneous implants {{need to be}} tested in biocompatibility studies. The use of animal models for testing usually involves numerous lethal biopsies {{for the analysis of}} the implant-tissue interface. In this study, optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to monitor the reaction of the skin to a percutaneous implant in an animal model of hairless but immunocompetent mice. In vivo optical biopsies with OCT were taken at days 7 and 21 after implantation and post mortem on the day of noticeable inflammation. A Fourier-domain OCT was programmed for spoke pattern scanning schemes centered at the implant midpoint to reduce motion artifacts during in vivo imaging. Image segmentation allowed the automatic detection and morphometric analysis of the skin contour and the subcutaneous implant anchor. On the basis of the segmentation, the overall refractive index of the tissue within one OCT data set was estimated as a free parameter of a fitting algorithm, which corrects for the curved distortion of the <b>planar</b> <b>implant</b> base in the OCT images. OCT in combination with the spoke scanning scheme and image processing provided time-resolved three-dimensional optical biopsies around the implants to assess tissue morphology.

40|$|AbstractObjectivePermanent {{interstitial}} brachytherapy is {{an ideal}} yet underutilized treatment modality for accessible, small volume gynecological malignancies. We present early clinical results utilizing a new permanent isotope, Cs- 131. MethodsA retrospective review was performed evaluating patients treated with Cs- 131 permanent interstitial radiation at our institution from July 2011 through June 2013. Doses were most commonly prescribed and calculated {{to a depth of}} 5 mm using Paterson-Parker <b>planar</b> <b>implant</b> rules for Au- 198. This activity was converted to air-kerma strength (U). A conversion factor of 1. 1 was applied based on RBE calculations, clinical observation and experience. Results 14 patients were identified among whom 17 Cs- 131 implants were performed. Seven patients were implanted as sole therapy, and a median dose of 50 Gy was delivered. Ten implants were performed as boost within a more extensive radiation treatment plan. In these patients, a median implant dose of 27. 5 Gy was used and the median total dose delivered in combination was 78. 25 Gy. After a median follow up of 12 months, the actuarial local control rate was 84. 4 %. A very low level of grade 1 – 3 reactions was observed with no fistula formations or other severe side effects. ConclusionsPermanent interstitial brachytherapy with Cs- 131 was well tolerated with favorable early results compared to other series. Cs- 131 has multiple favorable properties, including minimal radiation exposure to treating staff, and should be considered as a therapeutic option in appropriately selected patients. A methodology for dose prescription, calculation of radioactivity required and distribution of the isotope is also presented...|$|E

40|$|This free journal suppl. entitled: Special Issue: Abstracts of the EAO 23 rd Annual Scientific MeetingPoster no. 414 BACKGROUND: The use {{of dental}} implant coating {{based on an}} organic acid, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) with an ability of osteoconduction could be a {{promising}} treatment for some challenging cases of patients {{with a history of}} radiotherapy or patients with diabetes, osteoporosis, and other patients with poor wound healing. Biocompatibility and adequate biomechanical properties are the main requirements in determining the clinical success of any type of dental implant. Omega- 3 highly polyunsaturated fatty acid (n- 3 -PUFA) in a form of Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has been detected to provide advantageous effects on bone remodelling and biology. Ultimately, n- 3 -PUFA, including EPA, has been verified to positively influence bone health and skeletal biology. AIM/HYPOTHESIS: Hypothesis was set that EPA-coated dental implants might 1) increase the osteoconduction process, verified by {{a significant difference between the}} test and control side of the same implant by testing the axial pull-out test of the implants. 2) increase the rate of new bone formation on the implant surface verified by Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Xray findings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The current animal study was approved by the ethical committee of the University according to the regulations of (IACUC). Twenty four planar titanium plates (5 9 59 1 mm) were surgically fixed half way into the mandibular bone of twelve white New Zealand rabbits. The rabbits were randomly assigned into three study groups (n = 4). The <b>planar</b> <b>implants</b> were coated with EPA on one side and were highly polished on the other side. CBCT was used to inspect the bone-implant interface assessing the density and the new bone formation on the exposed part of the implant. The specimens were analysed by radiographs to the implants and the neighbouring bone structure to analyse osteoconductive bone formation at the coated side and to compare it with the bone at the control side. Axial pull-out tests were performed to the specimens to test osseointegration. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test and multiple time series comparisons Friedman’s test were employed. Both analyses were set at significance level of P < 0. 05 to compare differences in the amount of implant covered by new bone formation between the coated and the not coated implant surfaces in different time intervals. Osseointegration was analysed by comparing the amount of force, as an action of axial pull-out test, after periods of 4, 8, and 12 weeks respectively. RESULTS: By using CBCT and radiographs, osteoconductive bone formation was estimated at the coated test side of Ti compared to the polished non-coated side 4 weeks postoperatively. Statistical results showed significant difference after 8 weeks (P = 0. 05) on the EPA-coated side compared to the non-coated side. Also, statistical analyses revealed a significant difference (P = 0. 01) between the amount of pull-out force after eight and 12 weeks, compared to 4 weeks. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In the current experiments, the set up was designed to investigate the outcome of coating dental implants with EPA on osteoconduction after fixation in the mandibles of rabbits. As titanium implant fixture coating, EPA coating seems to enhance the anchorage between bone and external fixation of the Ti prosthesis. EPA-based implant coating stimulates osteoconduction processes in rabbits. This coating might increase bone healing processes after implant surgery. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{first use of}} He+ {{implantation}} to create integrated optic waveguide lasers, by modifying the refractive index of bulk laser host crystals. He+ ion implantation produces a variety of refractive index changes within different target (implanted) crystals {{which can be used}} to create planar and channel optical waveguides with propagation losses of the order of 1 dB/cm. The spectroscopic properties of the laser impurity dopant in the target crystal are generally not altered drastically by the implantation. The fluorescence lifetime is typically unchanged in the waveguide compared to the bulk crystal, but the fluorescent emission lines are broadened to an extent dependent on the implanted ion dose used to fabricate the waveguide. The wide ranging applicability of the fabrication technique has been demonstrated, with planar waveguide laser action reported in 5 neodymium doped materials, Nd:YAG, Nd:YAP, Nd:MgO:LiNbO 3, Nd:Bi 4 Ge 3 O 12 and Nd:GGG. Diode-pumped laser operation has been demonstrated. with absorbed power thresholds of around 10 mW, slope efficiencies up to 30 % and output powers up to 40 mW. The fabrication of gold ion-stopping masks several microns thick using photolithographic patterning has allowed the creation of the first index enhancement ion implanted channel waveguides, with channel waveguide laser action demonstrated in Nd:YAG and Nd:GGG. Very low laser thresholds of around 500 µW absorbed power have been obtained with diode-pumping of Nd:YAG, comparable with the best results achieved with single-crystal fibre growth. Slope efficiencies of 30 % have been achieved in both Nd:YAG and Nd:GGG. This thesis also reports the first use of ion implantation to create waveguides in tunable laser crystal hosts, Alexandrite and Cr:YSAG.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} {{of a large number}} of air sample filters was undertaken using a commercial alpha and beta spectroscopy system employing a passive <b>implanted</b> <b>planar</b> silicon (PIPS) detector. Samples were only measured after air flow through the filters had ceased. Use of a commercial radon stripping algorithm was implemented to discriminate anthropogenic alpha activity on the filters from the radon progeny. When uncontaminated air filters were evaluated, the results showed that there was a time-dependent bias in both average estimates and measurement dispersion of anthropogenic activity estimates with the relative bias being small compared to the dispersion, indicating that the system would not give false positive indications for an appropriately set decision level. By also measuring environmental air sample filters simultaneously with electroplated alpha filters, use of the radon stripping algorithm demonstrated a number of substantial unexpected deviations from calibrated values indicating that the system would give false negative indications. Use of the current algorithm is, therefore, not recommended for general assay applications. Use of the PIPS detector should only be utilized for gross counting without appropriate modifications to the curve-fitting algorithm.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis is focused on development and clinical evaluation of image-guidance solutions for correction of both inter- and intrafraction prostate motion in external beam radiotherapy. Corrections are based on <b>planar</b> imaging of <b>implanted</b> gold markers with MV and kV beams. The main advantages of the developed system include (1) high positioning accuracy, (2) minimal increase in fraction duration, (3) high degree of automation, i. e. minimal operator interference, (4) remote controlled couch re-positioning, (5) minimal additional imaging dose. Another important objective of the research was the assessment of residual errors, including organ deformation and rotation, to establish appropriate planning margins. One of the main findings of the research is that implanted gold markers allow for fast daily correction of translational errors in prostate radiation therapy with high accuracy. An investigation of intrafraction positioning errors which occur during the treatment delivery revealed that intrafraction errors partially reproduce from day-to-day, thereby limiting margin reduction in prostate radiotherapy if not corrected. Another finding was that deformation of the seminal vesicles limits margin reduction with daily online translation corrections based on implanted markers. Furthermore, the benefit of rotation corrections in addition to translation corrections was insignificant. Finally, electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) have significantly facilitated time and workload efficient strategies for managing daily positioning errors with minimal extra imaging dose to the patient...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if the alpha energy spectrum in a Passive <b>Implanted</b> <b>Planar</b> Silicon (PIPS) detector, as modeled by MCNPX [1], can be used to design a radon stripping algorithm for a continuous air monitor (CAM). This stripping algorithm would be employed to discriminate naturally occurring radioisotopes from the anthropogenic for nuclear safety -related applications. It is hoped that using an algorithm based on MCNPX simulations, the CAM will not be prone to false alarms when radon levels are dynamic as identified in other CAM systems [2, 3]. This work is focused on the design of the next generation air particulate detector (NGAPD) for the United States Navy. The primary isotope of interest is Co- 60. This radionuclide emits a beta with an average energy of 96 keV. Therefore, once deposited on the CAM filter, it will produce a beta continuum seen by the PIPS detector. In addition, as radon progeny is deposited on the air filter, these will give rise to characteristic alpha peaks and a beta continuum. This is primarily an issue in port-or land-based applications. Ultimately, measurement of a radon alpha spectrum is desired to predict the amount of beta activity which would be measured from the radon progeny decay chains. All excess beta activity could then be attributed to anthropogenic sources once the radon progeny contributions have been stripped out...|$|R
40|$|Penetrating intracortical {{electrode}} arrays {{that record}} brain activity longitudinally are powerful tools for basic neuroscience research and emerging clinical applications. However, {{regardless of the}} technology used, signals recorded by these electrodes degrade over time. The failure mechanisms of these electrodes are understood to be a complex combination of the biological reactive tissue response and material failure of the device over time. While mechanical mismatch between the brain tissue and implanted neural electrodes have been studied {{as a source of}} chronic inflammation and performance degradation, the electrode failure caused by mechanical mismatch between different material properties and different structural components within a device have remained poorly characterized. Using Finite Element Model (FEM) we simulate the mechanical strain on a planar silicon electrode. The results presented here demonstrate that mechanical mismatch between iridium and silicon leads to concentrated strain along the border of the two materials. This strain is further focused on small protrusions such as the electrical traces in planar silicon electrodes. These findings are confirmed with chronic in vivo data (133 – 189 days) in mice by correlating a combination of single-unit electrophysiology, evoked multi-unit recordings, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy from traces and electrode sites with our modeling data.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of charged particles with living matter has recently attracted increasing {{interest in the}} field of biomedical applications such as hadron therapy, radioprotection and space radiation biology. Particle accelerators are particularly useful in this area. In vitro radiobiological studies with a broad beam configuration require beam homogeneity. The goal is to produce a dose distribution given to a cell population that is as close to uniform as possible. In this paper, we compare the results of three devices used to assess the beam quality for broad beam irradiation: a passivated <b>implanted</b> <b>planar</b> silicon (PIPS) particle detector, a position-sensitive solid state detector, which is camera-like, and a solid state nuclear track detector (CR 39). The first device is a PIPS detector of 300 μm nominal depletion depth and an entrance window with a thickness of about 500. It is collimated with a 0. 5 mm aperture and mounted in air on an XY moving table {{as close as possible to}} the exit window of the beam line. The second device is a CMOS position-sensitive detector (technological process 0. 6 μm AMS CUA), 112 × 112 pixels, with 153 × 153 μm 2 pixel size. It allows the user to rapidly obtain dose uniformity over a surface of 1 × 1 cm 2. During uniformity and dose rate assessment it is placed in air at the PIPS location.

The DU source was crystallized uranyl nitrate (N 2 O 8 U• 6 H 2 O) solution, normally used for staining in electron microscopy with a manufactured average specific activity of 0. 3 uCi/g. Zebrafish, both larvae and adults, were exposed to three different mass concentrations, dissected, dissolved and counted using an LSC. The counts were compared to the standard curve correlating the measured activity {{to that of the}} mass absorbed. It was found that the larvae were more tolerant to the toxicity of the DU by almost a factor of 10 showing survival up to 200 ppm where the adults had zero survival when exposed to concentrations above 20 ppm. The absorbed DU was observed to concentrate more heavily in the skeletal structure and the blood containing organs (liver and heart) when comparing the relative mass concentrations observed in each organ compared to that of the whole fish exposed to the same concentration. The highest absorbed dose rate was found in the skeletal system at 3. 5 mGy/d followed by the blood containing organs at 2. 2 mGy/d when exposed to 20 ppm DU. It was also noted that the bioconcentration factors (BCF) of the adult zebrafish followed the same trend observed in similar studies. As the mass concentration of DU was lowered, the BCF calculated for fish exposed increased with a BCF of 130. 6 found for those exposed to 20 ppm U and a BCF of 774. 2 for fish exposed to 2 ppm.

Solid-state semiconductor detection using a passive ion <b>implanted</b> <b>planar</b> silicon (PIPS) detector of beta radiation from 99 Tc is being investigated {{as an alternative to}} scintillation detection. There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach, which are being quantified. To utilize the CAM PIPS detector, 99 TcO 4 - is being concentrated on DOWEX 1 resin. The batch procedure involves the aqueous solution and the resin coming in direct contact with the PIPS detector. The PIPS is spray coated with Teflon AF polymer to offer an additional thin (4 - 14 micrometers) barrier to the already rugged design. During equilibration time, the solution and resin are mechanically stirred. After sufficient contact time, the resin gravimetrically settles {{to the surface of the}} PIPS detector, at which point the detection commences. We are in the process of modifying this method for a continuous flow regime. With this new configuration the spent resin can be removed as a slurry from the detector and replaced with virgin resin. Using the batch arrangement we are able to obtain a detection efficiency of 14 % with 0. 01 g of resin. The background count rate 0. 32 cps. The background count rate is significantly higher than one normally associates with a PIPS detector, this is the result of having to increase the amplifier gain to be able to observe the low energy deposition from the beta interaction. Reduction of the background may be accomplished by one of two methods: (1) digital signal processing or (2) cooling the detector to reduce the thermonic emissions. We are currently working on the former, if that is unsuccessful, we will work on the latter. Development of macroporous scintillating YSO as a replacement to the macroporous polystyrene based scintillator was concluded, unsuccessfully. A total of fifteen formulations of YSO fluor were attempted. BET measurement indicated that we were able to produce fairly high (691 m 2 /g) surface area materials, but with no measurable luminosity. Measurement of the luminosity was conducted by excitation of the YSO with 241 Am and detection of the scintillation light with the Hidex Triathler. On the contrary, YSO that had good crystallinity, as measured by x-ray powder diffraction, and hence good luminosity (100 % of P- 47) had low surface area. It was concluded from these experiments that with the current formulation, in order to have high crystallinity and luminosity one needs to fire the sol-gel at high temperature ({approx} 1600 F), but to have high surface area one needed to fire at a lower temperature ({approx} 1100 F). A composite of ZnS: Ag-SiO 2 porous phosphor was also produced. The purpose of this study is to prepare porous blue emission phosphor by combining ZnS:Ag and SiO 2 to form a kind of composite material in such a way that ZnS:Ag provides the luminescence and SiO 2 provides porous structure. The end result was a high porosity material that did not fluoresce. For our application, we desire both high luminosity (> 10 % NaI:Tl) and high surface area (> 10 m 2 /g). Experiments were conducted to elucidate the impact of optical properties on light collection efficiency of heterogeneous scintillation flow-cell detectors. The optical transport Monte Carlo computer code, DETECT, is being used to model the experimental set-up. These experiments compliment earlier experiments where the charged particle energy deposition was measured and modeled.
