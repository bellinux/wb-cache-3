40|$|Abstract The {{prevalence}} of crime among {{illegal immigrants in}} the Netherlands appears to have risen. <b>Primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analyses</b> of police data showed that the involvement in crime among illegal immigrants (aged 12 to 25) reflects the patterns of delinquency among legal migrants of comparable age and country of origin. At present, the (rising) crime rate among illegal immigrants is perceived as (an increase of) „survival crime. that is caused by „marginalization., i. e., a lack of „social capital [...] The evidence presented in this study indicates that the relation between „social capital. and „delinquency. is not unambiguous, and suggests that additional explanatory variables {{should be taken into}} consideration besides social capital in the Netherlands...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a paucity}} of {{evidence}} regarding the effects of concussion on motor speech parameters. While the deficits in rate, accuracy and rhythm of speech post moderate- to severe-TBI is well documented, there is lesser understanding of how concussion impacts those aspects of speech. The present study analyzed the alternating motion rates (AMRs) and sequential motion rates (SMRs) of 44 collegiate athletes in an exploratory study of speech motor performance pre- and post-concussion. The effects of concussion on the objective measure of rate, as well as perceptual measures of accuracy and rhythm were examined across several <b>primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analyses.</b> Results suggested that only subjectively assessed accuracy levels of SMRs were significantly impacted post-concussion. Surprisingly, the post-concussion SMR accuracy ratings were improved for several participant groups, as compared to their baseline levels. Possible explanations for these results are discussed, and the implications for clinical practice are examined...|$|E
40|$|Though {{secondary}} {{analysis of}} qualitative data {{is becoming more}} prevalent, relatively few methodological studies exist that provide reflection on the actual, not idealised, process. This paper offers a reflexive account of secondary analysis focused {{on the topic of}} convenience food and choice. Several phases of the research process are examined: understanding context, defining a subject area, finding data and sampling, later sampling and topic refinement, and relating to transcripts. For each phase, I explore if reusing data is different from using it in the first instance, and if so, how those differences manifest themselves. The paper closes with reflections on the differences, similarities, and relationships between primary and secondary analysis of qualitative data. Although differences exist regarding the researcher-respondent relationship, <b>primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analyses</b> are more alike than not. The suitability of each approach can only be assessed in light of a particular research question.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} the effect that 2 lb and 5 lb hand-held weights had on vertical jump performance as assessed by vertical takeoff velocity. Secondary analyses were conducted to provide additional insight into the observed results. Thirty-one male athletes performed three countermovement jumps (CMJ) with an arm-swing under three different treatment conditions: holding a 2 lb hand weight in each hand (CMJ 2), holding a 5 lb weight in each hand (CMJ 5), and without holding onto any weight (CMJ 0). All jumps were performed on a forceplate, which permitted the calculation of vertical take-off velocity (vto), average force during the upward jump phase (avgforceup) and the duration of the upward jump phase (timeup). A repeated measures ANOVA was used to test for significant differences between the three treatment conditions for both the <b>primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analyses.</b> The primary analysis indicated that CMJ 2 and CMJ 5 exhibited significantly greater take-off velocities and thus, jump heights, than CMJ 0.

Cognitive function, arousal and recovery sleep (by polysomnography) were assessed during the extended wakefulness protocol. Placebo condition was associated with significant decrements in cognition, particularly at the circadian nadir (between 03 : 00 and 05 : 00). Pre-specified <b>primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analyses</b> (general linear mixed modelling, GLMM) at each separate time point did not reveal consistent improvements in performance or objective alertness with any dose of CX 717.

40|$|An {{interesting}} methodological {{aspect of}} secondary analysis {{is that it}} enables comparisons between constructions that constitute qualitative data analysis. This comparison is even more focused if a reanalysis is conducted, that means an analysis that reexamines both the primary study's data and the primary study's research question. In this article, a reanalysis is described that used interviews from the archive at the Special Collaborative Centre 186 (Sfb 186). One of the primary study's results was formulated as a hypothesis and subsequently "tested" by conducting a qualitative content analysis of the interviews. A comparison of primary study and reanalysis reveals critical decisions which may lead the data analyses to different results. These decisions are usually made implicitly and will show up only if contradictions between results are explained. As a second result of the comparison, typical threats to <b>primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analyses</b> are discussed. Primary studies seem to suffer from a "closure pressure", {{that it is a}} necessity {{to make sense of the}} data at all costs. This may stimulate researchers to close gaps in their data by speculation and to neglect contradicting evidence.

40|$|Objectives: To {{design and}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a pre-notification leaflet about research to increase recruitment to a randomised controlled trial (RCT). Methods: A methodological, two arm, randomised controlled trial was conducted, embedded within an existing cohort RCT (REFORM). Participants were randomised for the embedded trial, using a 1 : 2 (intervention:control) allocation ratio, prior to being randomised for the REFORM RCT. Controls received a trial recruitment pack. The intervention group received an additional pre-notification leaflet 2 to 3 weeks before the recruitment pack. <b>Primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analyses</b> were conducted using relative risk, the Cox Proportional Hazards Model and Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratios. Results: Of the 1, 436 intervention group participants, 73 (5. 1 %) were randomised into the REFORM trial compared to 126 (4. 4 %) of the 2, 878 control group participants. The associated relative risk (1. 16) was not statistically significant (95 % CI 0. 88 - 1. 56). The leaflet did not significantly increase return rate (RR 1. 10, 95 % CI 0. 92 - 1. 28) or decrease time to return (Hazard Ratio: 1. 11, 95 % CI 0. 93 - 1. 33). Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratios indicated that the intervention may be cost-effective if the true estimate of effect were close to the upper bound of the associated 95 % CI. Conclusion: A pre-notification leaflet to potential trial participants demonstrated a small difference in favour of the intervention with regards randomisation (0. 7 % difference) and return rates (1. 1 % difference). Results should however be interpreted with caution as confidence intervals for these estimates cross the point of no effect. Nevertheless, this research enhances existing evidence for pre-notification to increase recruitment rates, with further development and assessment of this potentially cost-effective intervention being recommended...|$|E
40|$|Opioid {{and heroin}} use has {{increased}} dramatically {{over the past two}} decades. This issue has public health significance as overdose rates and usage rates of these drugs have never been higher. This increase in use has been driven primarily by availability. The population considered most at risk for opioid/heroin abuse is young, white males. There is a significant comorbidity in opioids and alcohol and alcohol abuse has increased among this young white male population as well. There is evidence that the presence of medical marijuana in states is associated with lower rates of overdose from opioids and heroin. There is also evidence that marijuana acts as a substitute for alcohol in places where it is legal. The objective {{of this study is to}} look at the association between overdose rates by state, related to opioids, heroin or alcohol and the presence of medical marijuana in those states. We want to evaluate how state policies, like the presence of prescription drug monitoring programs, as well as socio-economic factors affect the rate of these deaths. Fixed-effect linear models were fit in order to do <b>primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analyses</b> of medical marijuana’s effects on overdose deaths. Medical marijuana was found to have a positive effect on the rates of overdoses related to opioids, heroin or alcohol. A secondary analysis showed a negative cumulative year effect. This suggests that overdose rates are initially higher in places that have legalized medical marijuana but that as time passes overdose rates fall. The actual magnitude of the effects of medical marijuana is small when compared to our socio-economic covariates. These results suggest that marijuana policy, while potentially useful in combating this drug epidemic, is less important than socio-economic factors in curbing overdose deaths...|$|E

Here, we estimate the net effect of these countervailing mechanisms among rural South African women. We constructed a retrospective cohort of 4845 women who first became eligible for the Child Support Grant with the birth of their first child between 1998 and 2008, with data originally collected by the Agincourt Health and Socio-Demographic Surveillance System in Mpumalanga province, South Africa. We fit Cox regression models to estimate the hazard of second pregnancy in women who reported grant receipt after birth of first child, relative to non-recipients. As a secondary analysis to explore the potential for grant loss to incentivize second pregnancy, we exploited a natural experiment created by a 2003 expansion of the program's age eligibility criterion from age seven to nine. We compared second pregnancy rates between (i) women with children age seven or eight in 2002 (recently aged out of grant eligibility) to (ii) women with children age seven or eight in 2003 (remained grant-eligible). The adjusted hazard ratio for the association between grant exposure and second pregnancy was 0. 66 (95 % CI: 0. 58, 0. 75). Women with first children who aged out of grant eligibility in 2002 had similar second pregnancy rates to women with first children who remained grant-eligible in 2003 [IRR (95 % CI) : 0. 9 (0. 5, 1. 4) ].

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the safety of DTaP-IPV/Hib vaccine routinely administered as part of clinical care to infants at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. MethodsThis was an observational, retrospective study that included all 2 -month-old infants vaccinated with either DTaP-IPV/Hib or another DTaP-containing vaccine. We monitored all subjects for non-elective hospitalizations, emergency department visits and selected outpatient outcomes (seizures, Guillain-Barré Syndrome, encephalopathy, encephalitis, alteration of consciousness, meningitis, hypersensitivity reactions, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic anemia, type 1 diabetes, and Kawasaki disease) beginning with their first dose through 6 months after a 4 th dose or until 24 months of age. We calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) in the primary analysis by comparing rates of outcomes during the post-vaccination risk interval with rates during a comparison interval more remote from vaccination. Secondary analyses compared outcomes after DTaP-IPV/Hib with those after other DTaP-containing vaccines. We reviewed the medical records of selected outcomes. ResultsFrom October 1, 2008 through July 31, 2010, 14, 042 subjects received a first dose of DTaP-IPV/Hib, 13, 194 received 2 doses, 12, 548 received 3 doses and 6702 received 4 doses. Overall, there were 166 comparisons with significantly elevated IRRs and 165 comparisons with significantly reduced IRRs. Medical record review of outcomes with significantly elevated IRRs in both the <b>primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analyses</b> did not suggest any relationship with DTaP-IPV/Hib.

The primary search focused on randomised controlled trials and the secondary search on cohort studies with a concurrent control group. Interventions aimed to modify techniques for lifting and handling heavy objects or patients and including measurements for back pain, consequent disability, or sick leave {{as the main}} outcome were considered for the review. Two authors independently assessed eligibility of the studies and methodological quality of those included. For data synthesis, we summarised the results of studies comparing similar interventions. We used odds ratios and effect sizes to combine the results in a meta-analysis. Finally, we compared the conclusions of the <b>primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analyses.</b> Six randomised trials and five cohort studies met the inclusion criteria.

40|$|Introduction: Constructively {{engaging}} male {{partners in}} women-centred health {{programs such as}} family planning and prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission has resulted in both improved health outcomes and stronger relationships. Concerted efforts to engage men in microbicide use could {{make it easier for}} women to access and use microbicides in the future. This paper synthesizes findings from studies that investigated men’s role in their partners’ microbicide use during clinical trials to inform recommendations for male engagement in women’s microbicide use. Methods: We conducted <b>primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analyses</b> of data from six qualitative studies implemented in conjunction with microbicide clinical trials in South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania. The analyses included data from 535 interviews and 107 focus groups with trial participants, male partners, and community members to answer research questions on partner communication about microbicides, men’s role in women’s microbicide use, and potential strategies for engaging men in future microbicide introduction. We synthesized the findings across the studies and developed recommendations. Results: The majority of women in steady partnerships wanted agreement from their partners to use microbicides. Women used various strategies to obtain their agreement, including using the product for a while before telling their partners, giving men information gradually, and continuing to bring up microbicides until resistant partners acquiesced. Among men who were aware their partners were participating in a trial and using microbicides, involvement ranged from opposition to agreement/non-interference to active support. Both men and women expressed a desire for men to have access to information about microbicides {{and to be able to}} talk with a healthcare provider about microbicides. Conclusions: We recommend counselling women on whether and how to involve their partners including strategies for gaining partner approval; providing couples’ counselling on microbicides so men have the opportunity to talk with providers; and targeting men with community education and mass media to increase their awareness and acceptance of microbicides. These strategies should be tested in microbicide trials, open-label studies, and demonstration projects to identify effective male engagement approaches to include in eventual microbicide introduction. Efforts to engage men must take care not to diminish women’s agency to decide whether to use the product and inform their partners...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Training and assistive {{devices are}} {{considered}} major interventions to prevent back pain among workers exposed to manual material handling (MMH). OBJECTIVES: To determine {{the effectiveness of}} MMH advice and training {{and the provision of}} assistive devices in preventing and treating back pain. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched MEDLINE to November 2005, EMBASE to August 2005, and CENTRAL, the Back Group's Trials Register, CINAHL, Nioshtic, CISdoc, Science Citation Index, and PsychLIT to September 2005. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCT) and cohort studies with a concurrent control group, aimed at changing human behaviour in MMH and measuring back pain, back pain-related disability or sickness absence. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed the methodological quality using the criteria recommended by the Back Review Group for RCTs and MINORS for the cohort studies. One author of an original study supplied additional data for the review. The results and conclusions are based on the primary analysis of RCTs. We conducted a secondary analysis with cohort studies. We compared and contrasted the conclusions from the <b>primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analyses.</b> MAIN RESULTS: We included six RCTs (17, 720 employees) and five cohort studies (772 employees). All studies focused on prevention of back pain. Two RCTs and all cohort studies met the majority of the quality criteria and were labeled high quality. We summarized the strength of the evidence with a qualitative analysis since the lack of data precluded a statistical analysis. There is moderate evidence that MMH advice and training are no more effective at preventing back pain or back pain-related disability than no intervention (four studies) or minor advice (one study). There is limited evidence that MMH advice and training are no more effective than physical exercise or back belt use in preventing back pain (three studies), and that MMH advice plus assistive devices are not more effective than MMH advice alone (one study) or no intervention (one study) in preventing back pain or related disability. The results of the cohort studies were similar to the randomised studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is limited to moderate evidence that MMH advice and training with or without assistive devices do not prevent back pain, back pain-related disability or reduce sick leave when compared to no intervention or alternative interventions. There is no evidence available for the effectiveness of MMH advice and training or MMH assistive devices for treating back pai...|$|E
40|$|This Masters thesis {{examines}} {{the process of}} the Islamisation of Bosnia from the eighth century {{to the end of the}} fifteenth century. This era of early Islamic influence has not previously been systematically studied, and remains an area little understood by many medievalists.

This thesis raises the following research questions: When and how did the first Islamisation of the Balkan Slavs (including Bosnians) occur? How did Islam influence Bosnian society and culture, and where were the Bosnian Muslim settlements established? This thesis includes a detailed historical investigation that makes use of a range of bibliographic materials. These consist of fragmentary works, archival and administrative documents and other relevant factography collected from a research field trip to Bosnia between June 27 and July 24, 2003. The main findings reveal the complexity of this culturo-religious process in terms of both the early Islamic influence and contemporary cultural diversity. While different theoretical approaches to cultural representation and social space assist in exploring the hybrid nature of Bosniak identity, the <b>primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> data <b>analyses</b> highlight the significance of the phenomenon of the early Islamisation of Bosni...|$|R
30|$|Even if not {{strictly}} correlated to APPJs, {{the use of}} schlieren imaging performed with an ICCD camera and a laser diode can be suitable for studies with extremely high temporal resolution of plasmas in liquid phase. This setup, for example, allowed investigators to detect {{the formation of a}} negative pressure region in the vicinity of a high-voltage pin electrode driven by nanosecond pulses and the following formation of a shock wave [58]. The phenomenon, attributed to the electrostriction mechanism, may {{play a key role in}} the development of breakdown in the liquid phase.

We aimed {{to summarize the}} evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of hsTrop on presentation. Methods: We searched electronic databases for studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of hsTrop in suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. Random effect meta-analyses and meta-regression were performed. <b>Primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analyses</b> were restricted to studies using conventional Trop and hsTrop in the reference standard, respectively. Results: Fifteen studies {{with a total of}} 8, 628 patients met the inclusion criteria for the primary analysis. hsTrop T (Hoffman-La Roche Ltd) and hsTrop I (Siemens) had sensitivities of 0. 89 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 86 – 0. 91) and 0. 90 (95 % CI: 0. 87 – 0. 92) and specificities of 0. 79 (95 % CI: 0. 77 – 0. 80) and 0. 89 (95 % CI: 0. 87 – 0. 90), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the area under the curve between hsTrop (95 % CI: 0. 920) and conventional Trop (95 % CI: 0. 929) at the 99 th percentile (P= 0. 62). hsTrop at the level of detection had a sensitivity of 0. 97 (95 % CI: 0. 96 – 0. 98) and a specificity of 0. 41 (95 % CI: 0. 40 – 0. 42). The studies using a cut-off at coefficient of variance < 10 % as opposed to the 99 th percentile for the conventional assay used for diagnosis reported higher diagnostic accuracy (relative diagnostic odds ratio = 2. 13, P= 0. 02). Five studies were included in the secondary analysis; hsTrop T (Hoffman-La Roche Ltd) had a sensitivity of 0. 91 (95 % CI: 0. 89 – 0. 93) and a specificity of 0. 67 (95 % CI: 0. 63 – 0. 70). There was significant heterogeneity among the studies. Conclusion: hsTrop have excellent diagnostic accuracy for myocardial infarction on presentation, but may not outperform conventional Trop assays. The variation among the studies can be explained, in part, by the cut-off used for conventional Trop assays.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop and}} {{evaluate}} a health-care communication training programme to help diabetes health-care professionals (HCPs) counsel their patients more skilfully, particularly {{in relation to}} behaviour change. Design: The HCP training was assessed using a pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled trial. The <b>primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analyses</b> were intention-to-treat comparisons of outcomes using multilevel modelling to allow for cluster (service) and individual effects, and involved two-level linear models. Setting: Twenty-six UK paediatric diabetes services. Participants: The training was delivered to HCPs (doctors, nurses, dietitians and psychologists) working in paediatric diabetes services {{and the effectiveness of}} this training was measured in 693 children aged 4 - 15 years and families after 1 year (95. 3 % follow-up). Interventions: A blended learning programme was informed by a systematic review of the literature, telephone and questionnaire surveys of professional practice, focus groups with children and parents, experimental consultations and three developmental workshops involving a stakeholder group. The programme focused on agenda-setting, flexible styles of communication (particularly guiding) and a menu of strategies using web-based training and practical workshops. Main outcome measures: The primary trial outcome was a change in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c) levels between the start and finish of a 12 -month study period. Secondary trial outcomes included change in quality of life, other clinical [including body mass index (BMI) ] and psychosocial measures (assessed at participant level as listed above) and cost (assessed at service level). In addition, patient details (HbA 1 c levels, height, weight, BMI, insulin regimen), health service contacts and patient-borne costs were recorded at each clinic visit, along with details of who patients consulted with, for how long, and whether or not patients consulted on their own at each visit. Patients and carers were also asked to complete an interim questionnaire assessing patient enablement (or feelings towards clinic visit for younger patients aged 7 - 10 years) at their first clinic visit following the start of the trial. The cost of the intervention included the cost of training intervention teams. Results: Trained staff showed better skills than control subjects in agenda-setting and consultation strategies, which waned from 4 to 12 months. There was no effect on HbA 1 c levels (p = 0. 5). Patients in intervention clinics experienced a loss of {{confidence in their ability to}} manage diabetes, whereas controls showed surprisingly reduced barriers (p = 0. 03) and improved adherence (p = 0. 05). Patients in intervention clinics reported shortterm increased ability (p = 0. 04) to cope with diabetes. Parents in the intervention arm experienced greater excitement (p = 0. 03) about clinic visits and improved continuity of care (p = 0. 01) without the adverse effects seen in their offspring. The mean cost of training was £ 13, 145 per site or £ 2163 per trainee. There was no significant difference in total NHS costs (including training) between groups (p = 0. 1). Conclusions: Diabetes HCPs can be trained to improve consultation skills, but these skills need reinforcing. Over 1 year, no benefits were seen in children, unlike parents, who may be better placed to support their offspring. Further modification of this training is required to improve outcomes that may need to be measured over a longer time to see effects. © Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Review of the <b>primary</b> results <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analyses</b> {{from the}} European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) and the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET). DESIGN: Review of 48 ECST and NASCET papers. RESULTS: The simple {{assumption}} that all {{patients with a}} symptomatic stenosis > 70 % benefit from CEA is untenable. Approximately 70 - 75 % {{will not have a}} stroke if treated medically. The ECST and NASCET have identified subgroups that should have expedited investigation and surgery (male sex, age > 75 years, 90 - 99 % stenosis, irregular plaque, hemispheric symptoms, recurrent events for > 6 months, contralateral occlusion, multiple co-morbidity). Accordingly development of local protocols for patient selection/exclusion should involve surgeons and physicians and take account of the local operative risk. The ECST and NASCET have also shown that the ubiquitous "string sign" is not associated with a high risk of stroke, and emergency CEA is unnecessary. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons must quote their own results and be aware that a high operative risk reduces long-term benefit. Accordingly, in those centres with a higher operative death/stroke rate, some "lower risk" patients should probably be considered for best medical therapy alone. It is hoped that pooling of the ECST and NASCET databases will enable more definitive guidelines to be developed regarding who benefits most from CEA...|$|R

30|$|The {{focus of}} LSAS on facilitating {{the study of}} (only) group-level {{statistical}} associations between test performance and background variables, or between test performance and other outcomes, offers test developers greater flexibility than usual. This has led to test designs that differ from the ones used in more typical settings. The designs used in LSAS have many advantages, among them an ability to incorporate a much larger pool of tasks than would be possible when administering the same test to all test takers, However, they also require the application of more sophisticated measurement models in order to generate the cognitive data {{that are used in}} <b>primary</b> (descriptive) <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> (model-based) <b>analyses</b> (Mislevy 1991; von Davier et al. 2007). Unfortunately, these measurement models and the properties of their output have sometimes caused confusion resulting, on occasion, in inappropriate analyses and faulty interpretations.|$|R
