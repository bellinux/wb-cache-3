5|$|In 2006, {{a lawsuit}} by the Alliance Defense Fund, a {{conservative}} Christian {{group in the}} United States, was brought against the state of Washington when it permitted a <b>public</b> <b>display</b> <b>of</b> a holiday tree and a menorah but not a nativity scene. Because of the lawsuit, {{the decision was made}} to permit a nativity scene to be displayed in the rotunda of the state Capitol, in Olympia, as long as other symbols of the season were included.|$|E
5|$|Japan has a {{comprehensive}} network of legislation for protecting, preserving, and classifying its cultural patrimony. The regard for physical and intangible properties and their protection {{is typical of}} Japanese preservation and restoration practices. Methods of protecting designated National Treasures include restrictions on alterations, transfer, and export, as well as financial support {{in the form of}} grants and tax reduction. The Agency for Cultural Affairs provides owners with advice on restoration, administration, and <b>public</b> <b>display</b> <b>of</b> the properties. These efforts are supplemented by laws that protect the built environment of designated structures and the necessary techniques for restoration of works.|$|E

50|$|<b>Public</b> <b>displays</b> <b>of</b> affection between {{individuals}} {{of the same}} sex may or may not suggest homosexuality depending on the cultural context. For example, in many African cultures it is socially acceptable for people {{of the same sex}} to participate in <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> <b>of</b> affection, whereas in other countries such as the United States and Portugal, it is considered indicative <b>of</b> homosexuality. <b>Public</b> <b>displays</b> <b>of</b> affection tend to be determined largely by culture which greatly influences perceptions of same-sex PDA.|$|R

5|$|John Gaughan, an American {{manufacturer}} of equipment for magicians based in Los Angeles, spent $120,000 building {{his own version}} of Kempelen's machine over a five-year period from 1984. The machine uses the original chessboard, which was stored separately from the original Turk and was not destroyed in the fire. The first <b>public</b> <b>display</b> <b>of</b> Gaughan's Turk was in November 1989 at a history of magic conference. The machine was presented much as Kempelen presented the original, except that the opponent was replaced by a computer running a chess program.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's blood-stained shirt, tie {{and jacket}} {{are now in}} the {{possession}} of the Los Angeles County District Attorney. Controversy arose in 2010 when Kennedy's clothing was transported to the California Homicide Investigators Association conference in Las Vegas, where they were included in a temporary <b>public</b> <b>display</b> <b>of</b> never-before-seen artifacts from crime scenes related to prolific serial killers and infamous murders, such as the Black Dahlia murder and the killing of Hollywood actress Sharon Tate. The items and Kennedy's clothing were subsequently removed from the exhibit, with the LAPD apologizing to the Kennedy family.|$|E
5|$|On May 17, 1898, {{the flag}} was {{delivered}} personally by Agoncillo and was packed {{among the things}} Aguinaldo brought back to Manila. This was the flag that was hoisted {{from the window of}} Aguinaldo's house in Kawit, Cavite, during the proclamation of Philippine independence on June 12, 1898 accompanied by the Philippine National Anthem Marcha Filipina. However, she did not witness either this first <b>public</b> <b>display</b> <b>of</b> the flag or the time when the flag was unfurled during the Malolos Congress because her husband remained in Hong Kong and she remained with him.|$|E

50|$|<b>Public</b> <b>displays</b> <b>of</b> affection are acts of {{physical}} intimacy {{in the view}} of others. What is an acceptable <b>display</b> <b>of</b> affection varies with respect to culture and context. <b>Displays</b> <b>of</b> affection in a public place, such as the street, {{are more likely to be}} objected to, than similar practices in a private place with only people from a similar cultural background present. Some organizations have rules limiting or prohibiting <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> <b>of</b> affection.|$|R

5|$|Election {{days for}} the Bundestag and the European Parliament are also flag days in some states, in {{addition}} to other state-specific flag days. The <b>public</b> <b>display</b> <b>of</b> flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-staff), can be declared at the discretion of the Federal Ministry of the Interior. When flags are required to be flown at half-staff, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the staff (if hung from a pole) or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).|$|E
5|$|The {{presumption}} that carnivorous dinosaurs, like Megalosaurus, were quadrupeds was first {{challenged by the}} find of Compsognathus in 1859. That, however, was a very small animal, the significance of which for gigantic forms could be denied. In 1870, near Oxford, the type specimen of Eustreptospondylus was discovered - the first reasonably intact skeleton of a large theropod. It was clearly bipedal. Shortly afterwards, John Phillips created the first <b>public</b> <b>display</b> <b>of</b> a theropod skeleton in Oxford, arranging the known Megalosaurus bones, held by recesses in cardboard sheets, in {{a more or less}} natural position. During the 1870s, North American discoveries of large theropods, like Allosaurus, confirmed that they were bipedal. The Oxford University Museum of Natural History display contains most of the specimens from the original description by Buckland.|$|E
5|$|Early {{settlers}} did not {{adhere to}} traditional architectural practices when constructing houses, but instead adapted to living conditions in Indonesia. Although the earliest houses {{are no longer}} standing, they were likely built from wood or bamboo with thatched roofs, resembling indigenous houses found throughout Sumatra, Borneo, and Java. More permanent constructions replaced these settlements in the 19th century. Segregation policies under the Dutch forbade the use of European architectural styles by non-European ethnic groups. The ethnic Chinese and other foreign and indigenous groups lived {{according to their own}} cultures. Chinese houses along the north coast of Java were renovated to include Chinese ornamentation. As racial segregation eased {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, the ethnic Chinese who had lost their identity embraced European culture and began removing ethnic ornaments from their buildings. The policies implemented by the New Order government which prohibited the <b>public</b> <b>display</b> <b>of</b> Chinese culture have also accelerated the transition toward local and Western architecture.|$|E

40|$|This Note seeks {{an answer}} to the {{question}} <b>of</b> whether <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> <b>of</b> the Ten Commandments violate the Establishment Clause of the Constitution. In analyzing this question the author first explains the language of the traditional and American hybrid form of the Decalogue. From there, the author describes the three part standard the Supreme Court adopted in Lemon v. Kurtzman to analyze possible violations of the Establishment Clause. Once this framework is in place, the Note lays out how courts have split in their determinations <b>of</b> whether <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> <b>of</b> the Ten Commandments, both the traditional and hybrid models, is a violation of the Establishment Clause. Ultimately, the author proposes that the Establishment Clause proscribes <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> <b>of</b> any version of the Ten Commandments because it contravenes all three prongs of the Lemon test...|$|R
