College students enrolled in introductory psychology were randomly assigned to five groups: 0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 %, reflecting the percentage of units on which each student was <b>proctored.</b> The results indicated that (a) the <b>proctored</b> students were superior to the non-proctored students as measured by final examination performance, (b) for the <b>proctored</b> groups, the amount of <b>proctoring</b> did not differentially affect final examination performance, and (c) the major effect of increased <b>proctoring</b> was an acceleration of the rate of progress through the course...|$|R
5|$|Father Secchi {{produced}} {{some of the}} first color illustrations of Mars in 1863. He used the names of famous explorers for the distinct features. In 1869, he observed two dark linear features on the surface that he referred to as canali, which is Italian for 'channels' or 'grooves'. In 1867, English astronomer Richard A. <b>Proctor</b> created a more detailed map of Mars based on the 1864 drawings of English astronomer William R. Dawes. <b>Proctor</b> named the various lighter or darker features after astronomers, past and present, who had contributed to the observations of Mars. During the same decade, comparable maps and nomenclature were produced by the French astronomer Camille Flammarion and the English astronomer Nathan Green.|$|E

25|$|The {{renovation}} {{and expansion}} of <b>Proctor's</b> Theatre in 2007 {{has been seen as}} the catalyst for the revival and renewed interest in Schenectady's downtown. The renovation cost $30 million and involved building two new theaters including an Iwerks screen, an expanded backstage area that allowed it to attract larger Broadway plays, and a power plant to produce electricity, heat, and air conditioning to the theater and sells excess to the surrounding properties. Prior to the renovation <b>Proctor's</b> had an annual attendance of 150,000 in 2004, five years later <b>Proctor's</b> attendance was 500,000 in 2009. The latest expansion is ongoing next door in a former 100-year-old bank building that had housed a Key Bank branch for the last 33 years.

After more than a week of caucusing among Democratic legislators, the nominations of McCreary, Knott, and Lindsay were withdrawn, and Williams was elected over Boyd. Historian Hambleton Tapp opined that the withdrawals were likely a part of some kind of deal among legislators, although the details of the deal, if it ever existed, were not made public.|$|E

5|$|Heading into Memorial Day Weekend, United {{wrapped up}} May {{with the opening}} match of their two-game West Coast road trip on 29 May at Jeld-Wen Field {{to take on the}} Portland Timbers. The Timbers, who held a 5–3–2 record prior to the match had won every single match at home during MLS play. United {{successfully}} ended that home streak with a 3–2 victory over the Timbers, thanks to goals from Perry Kitchen, his first professional goal in his career, as well as Chris Pontius and Josh Wolff. In the match, Kitchen opened the scoring for United with a 13th-minute half-volley thanks to a redirected header from Dejan Jakovic. While United were able to hold the 1–0 lead well into the second half of play, a chain of contentious decisions from center official Geoff Gamble, but primarily linesmen Eric <b>Proctor.</b> It was only the second MLS match that Gamble officiated, with his first coming on the previous weekend. In the 67th minute of play, United conceded a penalty kick to the Timbers. United goalkeeper, Bill Hamid initially saved Timbers striker Kenny Cooper's first penalty shot, only for the shot to be retaken. <b>Proctor</b> flagged for a retaking of the kick claiming that Hamid stepping off his line before the kick was taken, an infraction of the rules. The contrasting argument from Hamid, as well as other United players, was that Cooper stutter-stepped before taking the ball, which is illegal in the Laws of the Game. Nevertheless, it was ruled that a second retake would be taken, again by Cooper. Hamid consecutively saved the shot, only for <b>Proctor</b> to again rule that Hamid repeated the same original infraction. The ruling caused Hamid to storm over to <b>Proctor</b> in disdain for his decision, consequently earning Hamid a yellow card for dissent. For the third shot on the mark, Timbers captain Jack Jewsbury took the shot and buried it in the bottom left-hand post, leveling the score at 1–1. The stalemate was tentative, as Diego Chara of the Timbers conceded a penalty in the box when he mistimed a slide tackle on Pontius, leading to a handball. Pontius scored his second penalty of the season, and his second consecutive in league play to give United the 2–1 advantage. A quarter of an hour later, Wolff notched a goal, extending United's lead in the 85th minute. The Timbers' Jorge Perlaza scored a consolation goal in the 88th minute of play, but it would fail to be enough.|$|E

Flanders's appointment gave him seniority over the freshman Senators who would be elected four days later on November 5. Flanders ran for the office then, as well, and was elected to a full term. He was overwhelmingly reelected in 1952. He declined to seek a third term in 1958.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the impact of <b>proctored</b> versus un-proctored testing on practice time and learning for a self-study, online course in medical terminology. Participants included 120 college students in a pharmacy curriculum. Subjects were randomized to one of three groups utilizing textbook with <b>proctored</b> assessment, online instruction with <b>proctored</b> assessment, or online instruction with un-proctored assessment. A pre-test and post-test was administered to all three groups to evaluate learning. Content page “hits ” and practice quiz access was tracked for participants. Learning, as defined by pre/post-test change score, was greatest in the presence of <b>proctored</b> assessment (online and text) (p = 0. 027). In addition, use of practice quizzes had a stronger relative correlation with learning (r = 0. 401; p< 0. 001) when compared to content page “hits ” (r = 0. 257; p = 0. 024).
