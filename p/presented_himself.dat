5|$|Juskalian {{was flown}} to Paris, France, where he <b>presented</b> <b>himself</b> at a {{military}} post and requested financial assistance. However, {{he did not have}} official identification and was refused. An officer, who knew George's older brother Richard (Dikran), who lived in Watertown, overheard him and recognized the last name Juskalian. George confirmed that Richard was his brother, and he was then given all the provisions he needed.|$|E
5|$|Aquino's Book of Coming Forth by Night makes {{reference}} to The Book of the Law, a similarly 'revealed' text {{produced by the}} occultist Aleister Crowley in 1904 which {{provided the basis for}} Crowley's religion of Thelema. In Aquino's book, The Book of the Law was presented as a genuine spiritual text given to Crowley by preternatural sources, but it was also declared that Crowley had misunderstood both its origin and message. In making {{reference to}} The Book of the Law, Aquino <b>presented</b> <b>himself</b> as being as much Crowley's heir as LaVey's, and Aquino's work would engage with Crowley's writings and beliefs to a far greater extent than LaVey ever did.|$|E
5|$|Despite the title, St. John the Baptist Preaching did {{not have}} an {{obviously}} religious theme. The model, an Italian peasant who <b>presented</b> <b>himself</b> at Rodin's studio, possessed an idiosyncratic sense of movement that Rodin felt compelled to capture. Rodin thought of John the Baptist, and carried that association into the title of the work. In 1880, Rodin submitted the sculpture to the Paris Salon. Critics were still mostly dismissive of his work, but the piece finished third in the Salon's sculpture category.|$|E

5|$|In late 1401, the new {{war against}} the Order {{overstretched}} {{the resources of the}} Lithuanians, who found themselves fighting on two fronts after uprisings in the eastern provinces. Another of Władysław's brothers, the malcontent Švitrigaila, chose this moment to stir up revolts behind the lines and declare himself grand duke. On 31 January 1402, he <b>presented</b> <b>himself</b> in Marienburg, where he won the backing of the Knights with concessions similar to those made by Jogaila and Vytautas during earlier leadership contests in the Grand Duchy.|$|E
5|$|In the pre-war years, Göring enjoyed {{widespread}} personal {{popularity among}} the German public {{because of his}} perceived sociability, colour and humour. As the Nazi leader most responsible for economic matters, he <b>presented</b> <b>himself</b> {{as a champion of}} national interests over allegedly corrupt big business and the old German elite. The Nazi press was on Göring's side. Other Nazi leaders, such as Hess and Ribbentrop, were envious of his popularity. Even in the political circles of Britain and the United States, there were those who viewed Göring as more acceptable than the other Nazis, and as a possible mediator between the western democracies and Hitler.|$|E
5|$|The CCRC finally {{rejected}} the application in April 2012 in a 109-page report, which said the submission had not identified any new evidence or legal argument that {{would raise the}} real possibility of the Court of Appeal overturning the conviction. In November 2012 the High Court turned down Bamber's application for a judicial review of that decision. The following year di Stefano was sentenced in the UK to 14 {{years in prison for}} having fraudulently <b>presented</b> <b>himself</b> as a lawyer. As of December 2013 Bamber's defence team was said to be preparing a fresh submission.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the book}} by Nationalmuseum, the {{controversy}} concerned Carl Larsson's personal prestige and the ideals that he stood for, but his contemporaries would turn more and more indifferent to these ideals. The events embittered his last years and he declared in his autobiography that the controversy broke him down and that he admitted it with anger. It is clear {{that he began to}} identify himself with the work and it is possible that he also identified himself with the sacrificed king, as he primarily saw conspiracies and bad intentions behind the opposition. This identification was made apparent in his self-portrait, in 1916, where he <b>presented</b> <b>himself</b> as king Domalde, and which he donated to Sundborn parish where he lived.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} groups of his partisans fleeing the capital arrived at Demotika, Kantakouzenos, {{by his own}} account, tried to {{negotiate}} with the new regency, but his approach was rebuffed. Finally forced to take decisive action, on 26 October 1341, the army (2,000 cavalry and 4,000 infantry, according to Gregoras) and his supporters, largely drawn from the land-holding aristocracy, proclaimed Kantakouzenos Emperor. Although he still <b>presented</b> <b>himself</b> officially as a junior colleague to John V, and claimed to be only acting in the boy's name, having staked his claim on the throne, he had effectively started a civil war. Kantakouzenos still hoped that negotiation might resolve the situation, but all his envoys were imprisoned and he and his supporters excommunicated by Patriarch John XIV. On 19 November 1341, the regency responded to Kantakouzenos' proclamation as Emperor with the formal coronation of John V.|$|E
5|$|Charles, Prince Elector and Duke of Bavaria, {{claimed the}} German territories of the Habsburg dynasty as a {{son-in-law}} of Joseph I, and furthermore <b>presented</b> <b>himself</b> as Charles VI's legitimate imperial successor. If women {{were going to}} inherit, he claimed, then his family should have precedence: his wife, Maria Amalia, {{was the daughter of}} Joseph I. Both Charles VI and his predecessor Joseph I had died without sons. Charles of Bavaria suggested that the legitimate succession pass to Joseph's female children, rather than to the daughters of the younger brother, Charles VI. For different reasons, Prussia, France, Spain and the Polish-Saxon monarchy supported Charles of Bavaria's claim to the Habsburg territory and the Imperial title and reneged on the Pragmatic Sanction.|$|E

5|$|De Barth {{was born}} November 1, 1764, {{in the town}} of Munster, in Alsace, France. He {{was the son of a}} French nobleman, Jean Joseph de Barth, and his wife, Marie Louisa de Rohme. He showed an {{inclination}} toward clerical life from an early age, and his parents encouraged him in that vocation. After attending a Premonstratensian college in Belgium, he enrolled in a seminary in Strasbourg and was ordained there in 1790. The French Revolution forced many noble families into exile, including de Barth's, and they moved to the United States in 1791. De Barth renounced his titles and <b>presented</b> <b>himself</b> to John Carroll, the bishop of Baltimore, for service as a secular priest. Initially, he worked at Bohemia Manor as an assistant priest; shortly thereafter, he was relocated to Port Tobacco, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Henry <b>presented</b> <b>himself</b> as the {{legitimate}} heir to Henry I and commenced rebuilding the kingdom in his image. Although Stephen {{had tried to}} continue Henry I's method of government during his reign, the younger Henry's new government characterised those nineteen years as a chaotic and troubled period, with all these problems resulting from Stephen's usurpation of the throne. Henry was also careful to show that, unlike his mother the Empress, he would listen to the advice and counsel of others. Various measures were immediately carried out although, since Henry spent {{six and a half}} years out of the first eight years of his reign in France, much work had to be done at a distance. The process of demolishing the unauthorised castles from the war continued. Efforts were made to restore the system of royal justice and the royal finances. Henry also invested heavily in the construction and renovation of prestigious new royal buildings.|$|E
5|$|In 1388 he {{returned}} to Rome, possibly hoping that the accusations against him had been forgotten in the meanwhile. He was arrested, tried and imprisoned, but was released after Urban VI's death in October 1389 and the general amnesty granted by the new pope, Boniface IX. Leaving Rome, Paul went {{to the court of}} Amadeus VII of Savoy. There he <b>presented</b> <b>himself</b> as a distant relative to the Count—a claim likely relying on his tenuous links to the Palaiologoi, who in turn were remotely linked to the House of Savoy via Empress Anna of Savoy, Amadeus VII's great-aunt—and as a victim of papal persecution on account of his support for the Avignon papacy. Paul's claims of kinship were dubious, but Amadeus was moved by the plight of a fellow Avignon supporter, and accepted him as the legitimate Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. He provided Paul with money and an escort of twelve horses and twelve servants, and sent him on to the papal court of Avignon.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, {{the media}} speculated that Clinton {{would enter the}} Presidential race after {{incumbent}} New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored—but ultimately vetoed—by the First Lady). For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and {{twice as long as}} it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long and poorly delivered. Clinton <b>presented</b> <b>himself</b> as both a moderate and a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.|$|E
5|$|Mugabe {{focused on}} the {{propaganda}} war, making regular speeches and radio broadcasts. In these, he <b>presented</b> <b>himself</b> as a Marxist-Leninist, speaking warmly of Marxist-Leninist revolutionaries like Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Fidel Castro. Despite his Marxist views, Mugabe's meetings with Soviet representatives were unproductive, for they insisted on Nkomo's leadership of the revolutionary struggle. His relationship with the People's Republic of China was far warmer, as the Chinese Marxist government supplied ZANLA with armaments without any conditions. He also sought support from Western nations, visiting Western embassies in Mozambique, and travelled to both Western states like Italy and Switzerland and Marxist-governed states like the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, Vietnam, and Cuba.|$|E
5|$|Politically, Crease <b>presented</b> <b>himself</b> as a foe of the Hudson's Bay Company's hegemony {{over the}} colony, and in 1860 {{was elected to}} the Vancouver Island House of Assembly as an {{independent}} member representing Victoria. However, he was soon criticised by the British Colonist (a paper run by opposition leader Amor de Cosmos) for being too cozy with the HBC-backed government. The following year, as if to prove de Cosmos right, governor Sir James Douglas appointed Crease Attorney-General of British Columbia, and Crease resigned his seat in the Assembly. He was a key member of the government, responsible for pushing literally hundreds of laws through the legislature, in between his continuing circuit tours, most of which was concerned with regulating the resource-based economic activity of the colony, including land settlement and gold mining. His legislation cemented his reputation as an advocate of free trade.|$|E

5|$|The High Court quickly {{assembled}} at Nikli. Guy de la Roche <b>presented</b> <b>himself</b> {{before it}} {{accompanied by his}} own knights, but the assembled barons decided {{that they did not}} have the authority to judge him, and referred the matter to King Louis IX of France (r. 1226–1270). Guy travelled to France in 1259, but Louis not only pardoned him, but awarded him the title of Duke, which he and his successors were to bear thereafter. The renegade Geoffroy de Bruyères too was brought for judgement before William, and it was only the determined and passionate intercession of the other barons that saved his life and secured a pardon from the vengeful prince. He was however deprived of the possession of his domains by the inalienable right of conquest, and retained them henceforth as a gift from the Prince, meaning that they would be forfeit upon his death unless he had any immediate descendants.|$|E
5|$|According {{to a story}} {{published}} in Century magazine in September 1898, Edwin Emerson, Jr., was {{pretending to be a}} German journalist. He <b>presented</b> <b>himself</b> to the German Consul in St. Thomas and asked for the names of Puerto Ricans of German descent whom he could interview. Among the names which the consul gave him were that of the Riefkohl family of the town of Maunabo. Upon his arrival in the town of Maunabo he met 14-year-old Rudolph W. Riefkohl and asked the lad in German if he had a map of Puerto Rico (Emerson had lost his). Riefkohl answered that he did, however it was decidedly too big for Emerson's use. Riefkohl returned home, not knowing that Emerson was a spy, and quickly drew another with a depiction of the major ports and harbors of Puerto Rico. Emerson used the map and it is believed by some that he may have given the map to the U.S. Army Commanding General, Nelson A. Miles, influencing Mile's decision on the landing points for the invasion of Puerto Rico. A photostatic copy of Riefkohl's map was {{published in}} the Century article.|$|E
5|$|Wanyan Liang (the Prince of Hailing) led a coup against Emperor Xizong {{and became}} fourth emperor of the Jin dynasty in 1150. Wanyan Liang <b>presented</b> <b>himself</b> as a Chinese emperor, {{and planned to}} unite China by conquering the Song. In 1158, Wanyan Liang {{provided}} a casus belli by announcing that the Song had broken the 1142 peace treaty by acquiring horses. He instituted an unpopular draft that {{was the source of}} widespread unrest in the empire. Anti-Jin revolts erupted among the Khitans and in Jin provinces bordering the Song. Wanyan Liang did not allow dissent, and opposition to the war was severely punished. The Song had been notified beforehand of Wanyan Liang's plan. They prepared by securing their defenses along the border, mainly near the Yangtze River, but were hampered by Emperor Gaozong's indecisiveness. Gaozong's desire for peace made him averse to provoking the Jin. Wanyan Liang began the invasion in 1161 without formally declaring war. Jurchen armies personally led by Wanyan Liang left Kaifeng on October 15, reached the Huai River border on October 28, and marched {{in the direction of the}} Yangtze. The Song lost the Huai to the Jurchens but captured a few Jin prefectures in the west, slowing the Jurchen advance. A group of Jurchen generals were sent to cross the Yangtze near the city of Caishi (south of Ma'anshan in modern Anhui) while Wanyan Liang established a base near Yangzhou.|$|E
5000|$|If a {{penitent}} be {{in danger}} of death, any priest can absolve him, both from reserved censures and reserved sins. In case of reserved censures, if he recover, he must later <b>present</b> <b>himself</b> to the one having special power for reserved censures, unless the case was simply reserved to the pope.
