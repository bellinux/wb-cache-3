40|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungi (AMF), {{living in}} symbiosis with most food crops, improve plant growth and nutrition and provide fundamental ecosystem services. Here, {{the possibility of}} increasing root density and native AMF activity through appropriate soil management practices was investigated, comparing the long-term (10 years) effects of a <b>permanent</b> <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> (GC) with shallow tillage (ST) in a high-density olive orchard in a Mediterranean environment. Olive root density, AMF colonization, and soil mycorrhizal inoculum potential (MIP) were determined after trench excavations at different soil depths. Soil respiration was determined by infra-red gas analysis. The activity of native AMF, as assessed by MIP bioassay, was higher in GC plots than in ST ones. Olive roots were well colonized by AMF in both management systems. Soil respiration rates of GC plots were often {{higher than those of}} ST, whereas soil moisture and temperature in the topsoil were similar in both treatments. Soil depth significantly affected root density, which peaked at 0. 2 m soil depth in both soil treatments. The maintenance of a permanent plant cover appears to be a better option than shallow tillage as a soil management practice to preserve biological soil fertility in olive orchards...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{management}} {{is one of}} the key practices that influence vegetative and reproductive activity of the olive tree. Tillage, <b>green</b> <b>covers</b> (<b>permanent</b> or temporary), herbicide applications and mulching are all used in olive growing, although tillage is still the preferred method worldwide. Tillage allows to remove weeds, supply fertilizers easily, store precipitation water, and favours mineralization of organic matter. Yet, tillage promotes erosion in sloping areas with considerable soil losses. <b>Green</b> <b>covers</b> reduce erosion and ease trafficking of machinery when the soil is moist, as it often happens at harvesting. However, <b>permanent</b> <b>green</b> <b>covers</b> increase water consumption and this may be detrimental in arid climates. Herbicide applications and mulching are no so common as tillage or <b>green</b> <b>covers</b> in Italian olive orchards. Herbicides eliminate weeds but have a greater environmental impact than other methods of soil management. Herbicides are often used only along the tree row-combined with intercropping or tillage in the inter-row to reduce chemical inputs in the orchard. Mulching with polyethylene sheets is mainly limited by the cost and difficulty of disposing plastic sheets, whereas mulching with organic material is limited to family-run olive orchards because of shortage of mulching material.

30|$|The reform {{intends to}} adapt by 'greening' direct payments, aiming {{to improve the}} {{environmental}} performance of the CAP. This objective could be reached through environmental actions such as <b>permanent</b> pasture, <b>green</b> <b>cover,</b> crop rotation and ecological set-aside. The requirements of Natura 2000 areas and improved elements of good agro-ecological conditions standards could also strengthen direct payments (EC 2006 b, 2010 a). The provision of additional income support to farmers in areas with specific natural constraints as area-based payments helps to avoid land abandonment in marginal areas while providing public goods, and would be a measure in support of pastoralism.|$|R

40|$|Kentucky {{bluegrass}} (Poa pratensis L.) is {{a widely}} used, high-quality, sod-producing turfgrass. To maintain an {{acceptable level of quality}} and function requires irrigation in the semiarid regions of the western United States. Landscape water use, however, is coming under increased scrutiny, and reducing water inputs is a goal of many municipalities. To identify Poa germplasm that maintains green color under deficit irrigation over summer seasons, {{this study was designed to}} evaluate the percent of <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> of 24 Kentucky bluegrass cultivars, accessions (including core collections), and other Poa species. Cultivars generally had a higher percent <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> in spring and fall, while several accessions and old U. S. cultivars showed higher <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> during summer months. Other Poa species did not have percent <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> values above any cultivars and as a group consistently performed the lowest. Core collections of Kentucky bluegrass, aimed at representing overall variability of the species with fewer accessions, had variance estimates equal to or higher than the overall group of accessions. Seven cultivars and accessions consistently had higher percent <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> than the Midnight cultivar check during the August data collection dates, highlighting the potential to improve Kentucky bluegrass <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> over summer seasons under deficit irrigation...|$|R

40|$|Urban {{green spaces}} {{with a wide}} variety of {{functions}} to ameliorate the urban environment have been decreased and fragmented in the urban fringe areas of Southeast Asian cities.

From this view point, we inspected <b>green</b> <b>cover,</b> land-use and landholding, and their correlations in the urban fringe of Bangkok using GIS. As a result, the following four facts are revealed. First, urbanization has been proceeding together with land fragmentation, and <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> is finally diminished after the construction of a new house on a subdivided vacant plot. Second, rural land-uses sustain high <b>green</b> <b>cover,</b> while urban land-uses have relatively low <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> with a several range depending on the type of housing.

40|$|A {{portable}} dual-camera {{video system}} {{was used to}} evaluate the potential for using total projected <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> as an indirect measure of weed infestations in a wheat crop during early growth stages. The video system would have applications in mapping weed infestations to assist precision farming operations. The two cameras provided a real-time composite image of reflected light measured in red (640 nm), and near-infrared (860 nm) wavelengths. A simple ratio of reflected light intensity in each wavelength was used to isolate the growing plants from the background. Software was developed to automatically adjust for varying ambient light conditions and calculate the percentage of the image occupied by growing plants. Total <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> was measured at randomly selected sites prior to direct seeding wheat and at four growth stages following wheat emergence. The portion of <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> observed was compared to crop and weed dry matter at each location. Weed infestations at each location were estimated by measuring the total <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> and subtracting the projected <b>green</b> <b>cover</b> due to the crop alone. A minimum weed dry matter of 20 g/m 2 and 30 g/m 2 could be detected by the video system at the 3 -leaf and 5 -leaf growth stages, respectively. Weed dry matter less than 20 g/m 2 could not be detected reliably due to the variability of the wheat crop. Detection of weeds within the crop beyond the 5 -leaf stage using this method was difficult due to crop canopy closure...|$|R
