40|$|<b>Pneumatic</b> <b>actuators</b> are {{preferred}} for low {{to medium}} power requirements {{due to their}} desirable features like large power to weight ratio, low cost and safe working medium. Position control of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuators</b> is however difficult due to inherent nonlinearity-contributing factors. Therefore, position control of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuators</b> {{have been found to}} be a challenging task using fixed gain controllers. Sliding mode control can be used to overcome this difficulty. Further, the nonlinear response of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuators</b> under variable loading conditions makes it a fit case for using heuristic control based on the knowledge of the system behaviour. This may be done by using fuzzy logic based control approach. In the present work, a hybrid controller was synthesized using fuzzy logic control and sliding mode control for position control of a pneumatic actuation system. The quantitative results emphasized that hybrid FLC-SMC controller exhibited effective position control for pneumatic actuation system as fuzzy logic control was effective for combinations of lower payloads and smaller piston displacements, whereas sliding mode controller was effective for combinations of higher payloads and larger piston displacements...|$|R

50|$|<b>Pneumatic</b> <b>actuators,</b> or <b>pneumatic</b> cylinders, {{are similar}} to {{hydraulic}} actuators except they use compressed gas to generate force instead of a liquid. They work similarly to a piston in which air is pumped inside a chamber and pushed out {{of the other side}} of the chamber. Air actuators are not necessarily used for heavy duty machinery and instances where large amounts of weight are present. One of the reasons <b>pneumatic</b> linear <b>actuators</b> are preferred to other types is the fact that the power source is simply an air compressor. Because air is the input source, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuators</b> are able to be used in many places of mechanical activity. The downside is, most air compressors are large, bulky, and loud.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop a novel 3 D {{parallel}} mechanism robot driven by three vertical-axial <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuators</b> with a stereo vision system for path tracking control. The mechanical system and the control system are the primary novel parts for developing a 3 D parallel mechanism robot. In the mechanical system, a 3 D parallel mechanism robot contains three serial chains, a fixed base, a movable platform and a pneumatic servo system. The parallel mechanism are designed and analyzed first for realizing a 3 D motion in the X-Y-Z coordinate system of the robot’s end-effector. The inverse kinematics and the forward kinematics of the parallel mechanism robot are investigated by using the Denavit-Hartenberg notation (D-H notation) coordinate system. The <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuators</b> in the three vertical motion axes are modeled. In the control system, the Fourier series-based adaptive sliding-mode controller with H∞ tracking performance is used to design the path tracking controllers of the three vertical servo <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuators</b> for realizing 3 D path tracking control of the end-effector. Three optical linear scales are {{used to measure the}} position of the three <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuators.</b> The 3 D position of the end-effector is then calculated from the measuring position of the three <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuators</b> by means of the kinematics. However, the calculated 3 D position of the end-effector cannot consider the manufacturing and assembly tolerance of the joints and the parallel mechanism so that errors between the actual position and the calculated 3 D position of the end-effector exist. In order to improve this situation, sensor collaboration is developed in this paper. A stereo vision system is used to collaborate with the three position sensors of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuators.</b> The stereo vision system combining two CCD serves to measure the actual 3 D position of the end-effector and calibrate the error between the actual and the calculated 3 D position of the end-effector. Furthermore, to verify the feasibility of the proposed parallel mechanism robot driven by three vertical <b>pneumatic</b> servo <b>actuators,</b> a full-scale test rig of the proposed parallel mechanism pneumatic robot is set up. Thus, simulations and experiments for different complex 3 D motion profiles of the robot end-effector can be successfully achieved. The desired, the actual and the calculated 3 D position of the end-effector can be compared in the complex 3 D motion control...|$|R

Finally, experimental results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. ...|$|R
