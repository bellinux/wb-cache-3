40|$|SUMMARY <b>Pizotifen</b> is a {{clinically}} effective anti-migraine {{agent with}} potent anti-serotonin and anti-histamine properties. <b>Pizotifen</b> is equipotent in blocking contractions of the canine basilar artery induced by serotonin, norepinephrine or calcium chloride. As a result, the primary action of <b>pizotifen</b> in the canine basilar artery system {{appears to be}} calcium channel blockade and not selective antagonism of serotonin or norepinephrine. Calcium channel blocking ability {{may be related to}} the clinical efficacy of <b>pizotifen</b> in the treatment of migraine. Specific calcium channel blockers such as flunarizine, verapamil and nimodipine have recently been shown to be effective in the prophylactic treatment of migraine. ' 6 On the other hand, pizoti-fen is a clinically effective anti-migraine agent but has no known calcium channel blocking abilities. Instead, its efficacy in the treatment of migraine has been attributed to its potent anti-serotonin and anti-histamine properties. 7 However, <b>pizotifen</b> is structurally similar to cyproheptadine and amitrip-tyline, two other traditional anti-migraine agents which have recently been shown to possess calcium channel antagonist properties. 89 Because of the structural similarity and anti-migraine efficacy of these agents, the present study investigated the ability of <b>pizotifen</b> to inhibit calcium-dependent contractions of the canine basilar artery. Materials and methods Canine basilar artery contractions were studied using an in vitro chamber system described in previous publications. 9 ' 0 Briefly, dogs of both sexes were killed by rapid exsanguina-tion.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} interest in defining new agents or targets for antithrombotic purposes. The 5 -HT 2 A receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed on many cell types, and a known therapeutic target for many disease states. This serotonin receptor {{is also known}} to regulate platelet function. Thus, in our FDA-approved drug repurposing efforts, we investigated the antiplatelet activity of cyproheptadine and <b>pizotifen,</b> two antidepressant 5 -HT 2 A Receptor antagonists. Our results revealed that cyproheptadine and <b>pizotifen</b> reversed serotonin-enhanced ADP-induced platelet aggregation in vitro and ex vivo. And the inhibitory effects of these two agents {{were found to be}} similar to that of EMD 281014, a 5 -HT 2 A Receptor antagonist under development. In separate experiments, our studies revealed that these 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonists have the capacity to reduce serotonin-enhanced ADP-induced elevation in intracellular calcium levels and tyrosine phosphorylation. Using flow cytometry, we also observed that cyproheptadine, <b>pizotifen,</b> and EMD 281014 inhibited serotonin-enhanced ADP-induced phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, P-selectin expression, and glycoprotein IIb-IIIa activation. Furthermore, using a carotid artery thrombosis model, these agents prolonged the time for thrombotic occlusion in mice in vivo.

40|$|Abstract Background A recent Cochrane Review {{demonstrated}} the remarkable lack of reliable clinical trials of migraine treatments for children, {{especially for the}} two most prescribed preventative treatments in the UK, Propranolol and <b>Pizotifen.</b> Migraine trials in both children and adults have high placebo responder rates, e. g. of 23 %, but for a trial's results to be generalisable "placebo responders" should not be excluded and for a drug to be worthwhile it should be clearly superior, both clinically and statistically, to placebo. Methods/Design Two multicentre, two arm double blind parallel group randomised controlled trials, with allocation ratio of 2 : 1 for each comparison, Propranolol versus placebo and <b>Pizotifen</b> versus placebo. The trial is designed to test whether Propranolol is superior to placebo and whether <b>Pizotifen</b> is superior to placebo {{for the prevention of}} migraine attacks in children aged 5 - 16 years referred to secondary care out-patient settings with frequent migraine (2 - 6 / 4 weeks).

40|$|We {{conducted}} a study on 367 patients (86 % female, 14 % male; mean age 37 +/- 15 years) suffering from migraine with and without aura and chronic tension-type headache to evaluate the incidence of weight gain, an undesirable side effect observed during prophylactic therapy in primary headaches. Patients treated with amitriptyline (20 and 40 mg), <b>pizotifen</b> (1 mg), propranolol (80 - 160 mg), atenolol (50 - 100 mg), verapamil (160 - 240 mg), valproate (600 mg) and gabapentin (900 - 1200 mg) were evaluated {{after a period of}} 3 and 6 months. In particular, 89 patients were assessed (78 % female, 22 % male) at 6 months, of whom 10 were in treatment with amitriptyline 20 mg, 19 with amitriptyline 40 mg, 7 with <b>pizotifen</b> (1 mg), 13 with propranolol (80 - 160 mg), 4 with verapamil (160 mg), 10 with valproate (600 mg), 15 with atenolol (50 mg) and 11 with gabapentin (900 - 1200 mg). The control group consisted of 97 patients with migraine (79 % female, 21 % male; mean age 35 +/- 16 years) without indication for prophylactic therapy. Weight variations >or= 1 kg were considered. After 6 months of therapy, the percentage of patients with weight gain was 86 % with <b>pizotifen</b> (6 / 7; mean weight increase 4. 4 +/- 2. 5 kg), 60 % with amitriptyline 20 mg (6 / 10; 3. 1 +/- 1. 6), 47 % with amitriptyline 40 mg (9 / 19; 5. 4 +/- 2. 7), 25 % with valproate 600 mg (2 / 8, 3. 0 +/- 2. 8 kg), 25 % with verapamil (1 / 4, 2. 5 kg), 20 % with atenolol (3 / 15, 1. 7 +/- 0. 6 kg), 9 % with gabapentin (1 / 11, 1. 5 kg) and 8 % with propranolol (1 / 13; 6 kg).

40|$|ABSTRACT. Objective. To {{conduct a}} {{systematic}} re-view of evaluated treatments for recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in children. Methods. Online bibliographic databases were {{searched for the}} terms “recurrent abdominal pain,” “functional abdominal pain, ” “children, ” or “alternative therapies ” in articles classified as randomized controlled trials. The abstracts or full text of 57 relevant articles were examined; 10 of these met inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria required that the study involve children aged 5 to 18 years, subjects have a diagnosis of RAP, and that subjects were allocated randomly to treatment or control groups. The methodology and findings of these articles were evaluated critically, and data were extracted from each article regarding study methods, specific interven-tions, outcomes measured, and results. Results. Studies that evaluated famotidine, <b>pizotifen,</b> cognitive-behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and pepper-mint oil enteric-coated capsules showed a decrease in measured pain outcomes for those who received the in-terventions when compared with others in control groups. The studies that evaluated dietary interventions had conflicting results, {{in the case of}} fiber, or showed no efficacy, in the case of lactose avoidance. Conclusions. Evidence for efficacy of treatment of RAP in children was found for therapies that used famo-tidine, <b>pizotifen,</b> cognitive-behavioral therapy, biofeed-back, and peppermint oil enteric-coated capsules. The effects of dietary fiber were less conclusive, and the use of a lactose-free diet showed no improvement. There seemed to be greater improvement when therapy (famo-tidine, <b>pizotifen,</b> peppermint oil) was targeted to the specific functional gastrointestinal disorder (dyspepsia, abdominal migraine, irritable bowel syndrome). The be-havioral interventions seemed to have a general positive effect on children with nonspecific RAP. Many of these therapies have not been used widely as standard treat-ment for children with RAP. Although the mechanism of action for each effective therapy is not fully understood, each is believed to be safe for use in RAP. Pediatrics 2003; 111 :e 1 –e 11...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the stimulatory effect of hypoxia on the secretion of serotonin by neuroepithelial bodies (NEB) as well as to determine the relation between its level and changes in pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and also to determinate the effect of serotonin antagonists (<b>pizotifen</b> and methysergide) on the responses of pulmonary and systemic arterial pressures. The experiments were carried out in peripheral chemoreceptor-denervated dogs anesthetized with Na penthabarbital (30 mg/kg i. v.). On the breathing of normoxic and hypoxic (7 % O 2 - 93 % N 2) gas mixtures and on the injection of KCN (80 µg/kg i. v.), PAP, systemic arterial blood pressure (BP), tidal volume (VT), respiratory frequency (f/min), ventilation minute volume (VE) were determined.

40|$|The endothelial 5 -HT {{receptor}} mediating {{relaxation of}} pig pulmonary artery {{has been characterized}} using the selective 5 -HT 2 B receptor agonist BW 723 C 86 {{and a variety of}} structurally diverse 5 -HT receptor antagonists. If arterial rings with intact endothelium were precontracted with prostaglandin F 2 α (3 [*]μM), BW 723 C 86 caused concentration-dependent relaxation with a pEC 50 = 8. 21 ± 0. 03 and Emax= 89 ± 4 % relative to 5 -HT. The relaxant responses to BW 723 C 86 were inhibited by the 5 -HT 2 B receptor antagonist SB 204741, the 5 -HT 2 B/ 2 C receptor antagonist SB 206553 and the antimigraine drug <b>pizotifen,</b> yielding pA 2 values of 6. 68, 7. 20 and 8. 32, respectively. The pA 2 values against BW 723 C 86 were similar to those determined against 5 -HT. The relaxant effect of 5 -HT was antagonized by a variety of 22 compounds of diverse chemical structures. Based on the calculated mean pA 2 values the order of the most potent antagonists was ritanserin (9. 38) > methysergide (8. 86) > <b>pizotifen</b> (8. 47) ⩾ methiothepin (8. 32) > LY 53857 (7. 84) ⩾ amoxapine (7. 80) ⩾ loxapine (7. 73) ⩾ metergoline (7. 64) ⩾ mianserin (7. 51) ⩾ rauwolscine (7. 39). Compounds with weak blocking potency were yohimbine (6. 37), spiperone (5. 88) and ketanserin (5. 85). Correlation analysis between the affinities of the antagonists in pig pulmonary artery and those from radioligand binding studies at human and rat 5 -HT 2 B receptors showed a highly significant correlation (r= 0. 95 and 0. 84, P< 0. 002 and < 0. 005). Correlation with 5 -HT 2 C receptors was much lower (r= 0. 57, P= 0. 035), and no correlations were obtained with 5 -ht 6 and 5 -HT 7 receptors.

40|$|Hypothalamic {{control of}} {{prolactin}} (PRL) release in immature rainbow trout Salmo gairdneri was investigated using an in vitro perifusion {{system of the}} rostral pars distalis. Hypothalamic extract of trout induced a dose dependent stimulation of PRL release. A similar effect was observed when infusing the medium from a 24 h static incubation of the hypothalamus. Extracts from different control tissues (muscle, liver, gut) did not change in vitro release, thus confirming the specificity of this stimulatory effect. Hypothalamic extract from adult male rat, known to contain PRL release inhibiting factors, stimulated in vitro PRL secretion in rainbow trout. This suggests that PRL cells are predominantly influenced by PRL releasing factors. Measurement of TRH and serotonin content in trout hypothalamus indicated consistent physiological levels of these two factors. HPLC studies of hypothalamic extract showed that immunoreactive - TRH eluted {{at the same place}} as labelled TRH standard. Moreover, <b>pizotifen,</b> a serotonin antagonist, partially inhibited the stimulation observed with trout hypothalamic extract.

40|$|A survey {{shall be}} given on the physiological, {{pathophysiological}} and pharmacotherapeutic backgrounds of the biogenic amine 5 -hydroxytryptamine (serotonin; 5 HT), to be {{preceded by a}} few historical remarks. 5 HT is biosynthesized from L-tryptophan via hydroxylation and subsequent decarboxylation. 5 HT is predominantly found in enterochromaffin cells, platelets and in various structures of the central nervous system. Its concentration in circulating blood is low and probably subthreshold. Whereas the physiological role of 5 HT is rather unclear, 5 HT appears to play a relevant role in certain psychiatric disorders, in migraine and the carcinoid syndrome. Its role in essential hypertension remains uncertain. However, 5 HT appears to contribute to and to exacerbate the damage to blood vessels which were already predamaged by atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus or possibly old age as such. A major breakthrough in the pharmacology of the serotonergic system was achieved by the discovery of several subtypes of 5 HT receptors, with a corresponding collection of selective agonists and antagonists towards these receptor subtypes. This development {{is the basis of}} various drugs which interact with the serotonergic system and its receptors, like the various 5 HT 2 receptor antagonists (of which ketanserin is the prototype), methysergide, <b>pizotifen,</b> urapidil, flesinoxan and a variety of psychoactive drugs.

40|$|First {{migraine}} treatment reports {{come from}} the Egyptian medicine in 4000 BC. But {{it was only in}} 1918 that San-doz has isolated ergotamine and the pharmaceutical product was called Gynergene, which was used in gynecology as uterotonic. As from 1925 - 1927, Gynergene was accepted worldwide to treat migraine crises via muscular or subcutaneous route. In 1943, oral and parenteral dihydroergotamine was used to treat crises, being less effective, however with less side effects than ergotamine, due to its lower vasoconstrictor power. In 1980 it was indicated as prophylaxis for crises. The idea of prophylaxis appeared by chance in 1966 when Rabkin et al. 1 noticed improvement of migraine crises in patients with angina pectoris treated with propanolol; an accidental discovery. New and very efficient prophylactics were gradually being introduced in the therapeutic armamentarium: amitriptyline, calcium channel blockers, antiserotoninics (<b>pizotifen,</b> methysergide) among others. Since the first scientific approaches to treat and prevent migraine, one paradigm collapsed: “migraine patients shall learn how to live with their crises because this disease has no treatment”. As from the discovery of sumatriptan by Humphrey et al. 2 and then with the development of other drugs of this class (triptans), such as zolmitriptan, naratriptan, razatriptan, which are specific and more potent drugs to treat crises than those used to date, there was a trend to a new paradigm shift: migraine crises treatment could be th...|$|E

In minces of rat brain cortex, L-ascorbic acid concentration-dependently (0. 07 - 1. 0 mM) increases the levels of pregnenolone, allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone. This effect of L-ascorbic acid is region-dependent: in hippocampus, progesterone and allopregnanolone are also increased, whereas dehydroepiandrosterone is unchanged, and in corpus striatum only progesterone is increased significantly. 5 -Hydroxytryptamine (10 microM), 1 -(3 -chlorophenyl) piperazine (1. 0 microM), and 5 -methoxytryptamine (0. 4 microM) mimic the effect of L-ascorbic acid, whereas a pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine (400 mg/kg i. p., 2 days) reduces the amplitude of the L-ascorbic acid effect on brain cortical neurosteroids. The effect of L-ascorbic acid is blocked by the nonselective serotonin antagonists methiothepin, clozapine, methysergide, and <b>pizotifen,</b> but not mesulergine, spiperone, MDL 72222, and DL-propranolol, nor by the catecholaminergic receptor antagonists prazosin and S(-) -sulpiride. L-Ascorbic acid is not additive with dibutyryl-cyclic AMP and, furthermore, the inhibition of adenylate cyclase by MDL 12330 A, but not of phospholipase C by U- 73122, markedly attenuates the L-ascorbic acid-induced increase of pregnenolone in rat brain cortical minces. Together these data suggest that L-ascorbic acid plays a role in the modulation of neurosteroidogenesis, presumably by favoring the activation of the purported serotonin type 6 receptor by endogenous serotonin...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} cytokines on vascular permeability in vivo. Wistar rats received intradermal injections of various cytokine preparations and the permeability index (delta PI) was calculated from {{the difference between the}} absorption values of cytokine- and vehicle-treated skin sections after the extraction of accumulated Evans blue vital dye. Injections of a mixture of recombinant interleukin- 1 alpha and beta (Il- 1 alpha, IL- 1 beta) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) caused a maximal increase of permeability after 30 min (delta PI = 2). The administration of single recombinant cytokines revealed that the increase of permeability is mainly due to the action of IL- 1 beta (delta PI = 1. 4) and IFN-gamma (delta PI = 2. 9) (P less than 0. 001) at doses of 1 - 20 microU per injection site. IL- 1 alpha slightly increased vascular permeability, whereas recombinant IL- 2 and recombinant tumour necrosis factor alpha had no significant effects. Histological observations revealed significantly increased numbers of degranulated mast cells in skin sections pretreated with IL- 1 beta (P less than 0. 005) or IFN-gamma (P less than 0. 001). The cytokine-mediated rise of vascular permeability could be suppressed by pretreatment of the animals with the vasoactive amine antagonizing drugs methysergide, <b>pizotifen</b> and cyproheptadine. Our experiments indicate an important role of IL- 1 beta and IFN-gamma as vasoactive substances besides their function as hormone-like messengers between leucocytes...|$|E
40|$|Serotonin {{released}} from aggregating platelets can reach sufficient concentrations to affect local vascular {{function in a}} number of ways. The monoamine can cause contraction of blood vessels by its direct action on smooth muscle or by potentiating the effect of other vasoconstrictor agents. It can also induce vasodilatation by a direct relaxing effect on smooth muscle, by inhibition of adrenergic nerves, and by release of an uncharacterised relaxing factor from endothelial cells. One of its most likely physiological roles is to aid in haemostasis by promoting platelet aggregation and by causing local vasoconstriction at sites of injury. It probably has a role in some forms of vascular pathology as well: it may contribute to vasospasms of cerebral, coronary, and digital arteries, particularly if there is endothelial dysfunction or damage. Much evidence has implicated serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine) in the pathogenesis of migraine. Serotonergic agonists, such as ergotamine, and antagonists, such as methysergide and <b>pizotifen,</b> are both used in therapy of migraine. Promising but conflicting early results have not yet defined a place for serotonergic antagonists in other vasospastic disorders. The antihypertensive efficacy of one serotonergic antagonist, ketanserin, raises questions about the possible involvement of serotonin in either the initiation or the maintenance of the elevated peripheral vascular resistance in several forms of hypertension, including essential hypertension. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Cluster {{headache}} is characterised by repeated {{attacks of}} strictly unilateral {{pain in the}} orbital region associated with local autonomic symptoms or signs. The attacks are brief but of a very severe, almost excruciating intensity. For unknown reasons males are affected more often than females. Recent studies suggest that an autosomal dominant gene has a role in some families with cluster headache. Hormonal studies indicate a dysfunction in the central nervous system. Neuro-imaging has revealed primary defects in the hypothalamic grey matter. Local homolateral dilatation in the intracranial segment of the internal carotid and ophthalmic arteries during attacks {{is the result of}} a generic neurovascular activation, probably mediated by trigeminal parasympathetic reflexes. Sumatriptan 6 mg subcutaneously is the drug of choice in the treatment of acute attacks. Inhalation of 100 % oxygen can also be recommended. In the prophylactic treatment, verapamil is the first option. Other drugs that can be considered are corticosteroids, which may induce a remission of frequent, severe attacks, and lithium. Oral ergotamine tartrate may be sufficient for patients with night attacks and/or short, rather mild to moderately severe cluster headache periods. Third line drugs are serotonin inhibitors (methysergide and <b>pizotifen)</b> and valproic acid. Patients should he encouraged to keep headache diaries and be carefully instructed about the nature and treatment of the headaches. Alcohol can bring on extra attacks and should not be consumed during active periods of cluster headache...|$|E
