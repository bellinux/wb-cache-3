Hazlitt admired both as champions of liberty, and befriended especially the younger Hunt, who found work for him. He began to contribute miscellaneous essays to The Examiner in 1813, and the scope of his work for the Chronicle was expanded to include drama criticism, literary criticism, and political essays. In 1814 The Champion was added to the list of periodicals that accepted Hazlitt's by-now profuse output of literary and political criticism. A critique of Joshua Reynolds' theories about art appeared there as well, one of Hazlitt's major forays into art criticism.|$|E
2500|$|Canning was {{acclaimed}} as {{a powerful}} orator and in later years for his achievements in international diplomacy. He was also criticised as overly ambitious, [...] "slippery", and a [...] "game player", and remained highly controversial throughout his political career. Hazlitt, at least from {{his days as a}} <b>parliamentary</b> <b>reporter,</b> had been following Canning for years, and, as with Brougham, had commented before about Canning's speechmaking. Canning's support for the Pitt government, which favoured a prolonged war with France, laying a heavy burden on the British populace, led Hazlitt to view Canning as self-centred, insensitive {{to the needs of the}} people, too ready to side with royal power, and ultimately dangerous.|$|E

During this time he wrote in both prose and verse for major provincial newspapers about station life. He studied for the Congregational ministry and Wright studied divinity from 1896 at the University of Otago. [...] Wright had {{done a lot of}} private reading, but found that apart from English his education was generally below that of the other students. In 1897 Wright was awarded a Stuart prize for poetry. Wright published four volumes of ballads, Aorangi and other Verses (1896), Station Ballads and other Verses (1897), Wisps of Tussock (1900), and New Zealand Chimes (1900). As a clergyman Wright was liked, but he found the work uncongenial and gave it up for journalism in which he had considerable experience in New Zealand. Wright married Elizabeth Couper at Dunedin on 3 August 1899; a son David was born in 1900, but the marriage failed.

Charles Dickens was then living, as a bachelor, in Furnival's Inn, and was engaged as a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>reporter</b> on The Morning Chronicle. The [...] "Sketches by Boz" [...] were written during these years, published first in [...] "The Monthly Magazine" [...] and continued in The Evening Chronicle. He was engaged to be married to Catherine Hogarth in 1835--the marriage took place on the 2nd April, 1836; and he continued to live in Furnival's Inn with his wife {{for more than a year}} after their marriage. They passed the summer months of that year in a lodging at Chalk, near Gravesend, in the neighbourhood associated with all his life, from his childhood to his death. The two letters which we publish, addressed to his wife as Miss Hogarth, have no date, but were written in 1835. The first of the two refers to the offer made to him by Chapman and Hall to edit a monthly periodical, the emolument (which he calls [...] "too tempting to resist!") to be fourteen pounds a month. The bargain was concluded, and this was the starting of [...] "The Pickwick Papers." [...] The first number was published in March, 1836.

On October 14 young Busby forced his way on to the stage of Drury Lane, attempted to recite his father's address, and was taken into custody. On the next night, Dr. Busby, speaking from one of the boxes, obtained a hearing for his son, who could not, however, make his voice heard in the theatre. Then another [...] "rejected" [...] author tried to recite his composition, but was hooted down. Order was restored by Raymond reminding the audience that the Chamberlain's licence was necessary for all stage speeches. To the failure of the younger Busby (himself a competitor and the author of an [...] "Unalogue" [...] of fifty-six lines) to make himself heard, Byron alludes in the stage direction to the 'Parenthetical Address'--"to be spoken in an inarticulate voice by Master P." [...] The 'Parenthetical Address' appeared in the 'Morning Chronicle' for October 23, 1812. In the same issue was printed a long statement by Dr. Busby, in which, after paying a compliment to Byron's [...] "poetical genius," [...] he insisted that the Committee of Drury Lane had broken faith by not choosing one of the addresses sent in by competitors. (See references to Dr. Busby in 'Poems', vol. i. pp. 481 and 485, 'note' 1.) Dr. Thomas Busby (1755-1838) composed the music for Holcroft's 'Tale of Mystery', the first musical melodrama produced on the English stage (Covent Garden, November 13, 1802).

60|$|I do not for {{a moment}} seek to conceal that I know this Institution has been objected to. As an open fact {{challenging}} the freest discussion and inquiry, and seeking no sort of shelter or favour but what it can win, it has nothing, I apprehend, but itself, to urge against objection. No institution conceived in perfect honesty and good faith {{has a right to}} object to being questioned to any extent, and any institution so based must be in the end the better for it. Moreover, that this society has been questioned in quarters deserving of the most respectful attention I take to be an indisputable fact. Now, I for one have given that respectful attention, and I have come out of the discussion to where you see me. The whole circle of the arts is pervaded by institutions between which and this I can descry no difference. The painters' art has four or five such institutions. The musicians' art, so generously and charmingly represented here, has likewise several such institutions. In my own art there is one, concerning the details of which my noble friend the president of the society and myself have torn each other's hair to a considerable extent, and which I would, if I could, assimilate more nearly to this. In the dramatic art there are four, and I never yet heard of any objection to their principle, except, indeed, in the cases of some famous actors of large gains, who having through the whole period of their successes positively refused to establish a right in them, became, in their old age and decline, repentant suppliants for their bounty. Is it urged against this particular Institution that it is objectionable because a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>reporter,</b> for instance, might report a subscribing M.P. in large, and a non-subscribing M.P. in little? Apart from the sweeping nature of this charge, which, it is to be observed, lays the unfortunate member and the unfortunate reporter under pretty much the same suspicion--apart from this consideration, I reply that it is notorious in all newspaper offices that every such man is reported according to the position he can gain in the public eye, and according to the force and weight of what he has to say. And if there were ever to be among the members of this society one so very foolish to his brethren, and so very dishonourable to himself, as venally to abuse his trust, I confidently ask those here, the best acquainted with journalism, whether they believe it possible that any newspaper so ill-conducted as to fail instantly to detect him could possibly exist as a thriving enterprise for one single twelvemonth? No, ladies and gentlemen, the blundering stupidity of such an offence would have no chance against the acute sagacity of newspaper editors. But I will go further, and submit to you that its commission, if it be to be dreaded at all, is far more likely {{on the part of some}} recreant camp-follower of a scattered, disunited, and half-recognized profession, than when there is a public opinion established in it, by the union of all classes of its members for the common good: the tendency of which union must in the nature of things be to raise the lower members of the press towards the higher, and never to bring the higher members to the lower level.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} leaks from the {{perspective}} of political journalists, in particular, those working in the parliamentary round. This work draws on interviews with journalists in 25 of the 33 mainstream bureaus in the Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery (FFPG). It is based on a view that parliamentary democracy andthe parliamentary journalism round share a co-genesis – that mature representative democracies and principles of press freedoms are twin outcomes of the same gestation that binds <b>parliamentary</b> <b>reporters</b> and parliamentarians in a never-ending contest over information. Further, it is argued the health of this interdependent relationship {{can be seen as a}} bellwether for the key tradition of transparency in Westminster-derived democracies. In 2005, one of the longest-serving members of the FPPG, Michelle Grattan described it this way: “It is an old message that media and politicians are both natural adversaries and in a parasitic relationship. Their interests are often at odds. Sometimes they are openly at war, constantly they are engaged in a struggle of wits. What’s interesting is how this traditional conflict and cooperation plays out in new circumstances. ” (Grattan, 2005 p. 2) The topic of leaks highlights an important aspect of the contemporary state of play in this many- faceted struggle...|$|R

The first issue, only eight pages long, was published on 2 November 1913. In 1919, the corporation Árvakur bought out the company. The paper {{had a close}} relationship with the conservative Independence Party (Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn), especially during the Cold War, and its editors or their <b>parliamentary</b> <b>reporters</b> routinely sat in on meetings of the parliamentary party until 1983 when Geir Hallgrímsson, Chairman of the Board of Árvakur and also the Chairman of the Independence Party, decided that this relationship was neither {{in the best interests of}} the party nor the newspaper. Although its connection with the Independence Party is not as direct as in previous decades, the newspaper is sometimes criticised for leaning too much towards the party, especially at election times. Although the paper shares the mainstream conservative values of the Independence Party, it has also shown its independence on some key issues, especially in the debate on fishing rights distribution. Lately the paper has made a point of recruiting left-leaning journalists and has echoed feminist policies on its op-ed pages.

An apple of Sodom set in the clusters of Gomorrah: that, little as he suspects it, is the definition of the poor chaotically eloquent man, with his emulous parliament and miserable adoring world!--Considered as the whole of education, or human culture, which it now is in our modern manners; all apprenticeship except to mere handicraft having fallen obsolete, and the [...] "educated man" [...] being with us emphatically and exclusively the man that can speak well with tongue or pen, and astonish men by the quantities of speech he has heard ("tremendous reader," [...] "walking encyclopaedia," [...] and such like),--the Art of Speech is probably definable in that case as the short summary of all the Black Arts put together.|$|R

The shift from an analog to digital workflow introduces computation as a central component of news production. This enables variability for end users, automation of tedious tasks for newsrooms, and allows journalists to tackle analysis of the increasingly large sets of data relevant to citizens. To journalism, computerization is a promising path for news production, particularly {{for those who are}} able to wield computers to their specific needs through programming as a journalistic method. Toolmakers and users, both internal in the newsrooms and external in academia and in the IT business, are putting effort into making computational journalism a reality. While the hypothetical aspects of computational journalism are easy to find, this thesis provides studies of computational efforts in newsrooms as well as experimental prototyped suggestions in order to provide {{a better understanding of how}} practices in journalism intersect with computing as information science. This thesis approaches software-oriented news production as (1) a socially situated practice in newsrooms and (2) a design science research problem. The newsroom approach includes an analysis of news applications; journalistic output that consists of software code as a part of news storytelling. The analysis focuses on what technical and visual elements these applications consists of and how they compare as journalistic products in relation to the core functions of the journalistic social contract. Further, authors of news applications as journalist-programmers are interviewed in order to give an account of how this practice is situated in the newsroom and how these practitioners view their efforts in relation to technical, social, and journalistic considerations. As a design science research problem, I have approached computational journalism as an effort to produce software for journalism by user testing a custom prototype for dealing with analysis of social media messages, and as an effort to produce software as journalism in creating a tool for watchdogging the parliamentary data API, aided by expert <b>parliamentary</b> <b>reporters</b> to discuss how such an endeavor could be formulated and executed. Results show that advanced technological work is used, both in creating news applications and in an array of other newsroom-internal workflows, to continue traditional journalistic functions and themes, under the premises of digital media logic where software creation can be used to gather, systematize, and analyze material as well as to publish code in digital journalism online. The practitioners that have these skills use them as a journalistic method and underline their positions as journalists not technologists. This view of technological work as journalistic is not universal in journalism, where technical work is often segregated from journalistic work. Creating software for journalism, as exemplified as a tool to aid analysis of user-generated content, requires solid understanding of what journalists do rather that what journalism is intended to do. Finding stories and sources in social media is a matter of negotiating limited resources and the authorship of messages counts heavily in favor of known persons over popular or alternative arguments. The types of stories the prototype was found to best aid were soft and human interest stories, findings in accordance with other studies of journalists’ utilization of user-generated content. Creating software as journalism, taking a more user-centered design approach, created richer insight into how one subgroup of journalists (<b>parliamentary</b> <b>reporters)</b> relate to software in their beat. The possibilities for journalistic reinvention were clearly expressed, as was a stricter boundary between journalistic and technical work, where journalism is a function that transforms facts and data into journalism by adding context, interpretation, and explanations. The particularity of parliamentary reporters’ workflow, that to a large extent depends on oral sources and traditional social networking, is mostly unsuited for computational aid based on the parliaments’ API, but fact-checking and analysis of background information on members of parliament through a software-oriented approach is seen as complimentary and promising rather than threatening to the craft. While computational journalism emerges from traditions of software-oriented news productions that to a large extent overlap as a merge of computer science and journalism, some distinctive features distinguish and define this field. Both internally in the newsroom and as journalistic output, computational journalism is defined be a shift towards platforms, in creating spaces for finding, discussing and narrating stories. This can include the management of computable models, not merely collected sets of data. As a craft, creating software to solve journalistic problems, computational thinking becomes a key skill that defines both reasonable expectations and limitations, but also collaborations. The difference in technological sophistication between computational journalists as the newsrooms at large is under constant negotiation. Programming journalists strive for higher journalistic capital, while newsrooms adapt by both embracing computational efforts as possibilities for journalistic reinvention and keeping a distance by labeling the work as technical. Journalistic values and values of technology (or reasons for utilizing technology), can contradict each other. The gap that needs to be acknowledged in order to stay accountable in computational news production is above all an understanding of technology as a companion (and antagonist) of agency in news production. </p...|$|R
