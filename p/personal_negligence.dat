The <b>personal</b> <b>negligence</b> of some respondents, inadequate security measures, and opportunities created deliberately, or out of ignorance by employees, made it possible for the armed robbers to gain entry to homes. All the respondents were physically assaulted, and held at gunpoint to intimidate them into telling where valuables were kept in the house. The experience of being robbed and violently assaulted left them with feelings of ontological insecurity, xenophobia and distrust of strangers, fear of crime and little confidence in the government and police to maintain law and order. The manner in which short-term insurance claims were negotiated and the amount of money eventually paid out, was a final source of frustration and disgust for many respondents...|$|E

Lewis & Clark had already filed a complaint for exoneration from, or limitation of, liability in the District Court under the Limitation of Liability Act (Act). Subsequently, the court approved a surety bond of $450,000, representing Lewis & Clark's interest in the vessel, ordered that any claim related to the incident be filed with the court within a specified period, and enjoined the filing or prosecution of any suits related to the incident. The injunction prevented Lewis from litigating his personal injury claims in state court and he moved to dissolve it. Ultimately, the court dissolved the injunction.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the application of}} mediation for commercial disputes following {{the introduction of the}} Civil Procedure Rules (CPR), which encouraged the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR). A report is given on a survey of lawyers practising in the UK commercial litigation field and the respondents' experience of using ADR. An analysis is made of the settlement outcomes reported for mediation and respondents' attitudes to the appropriate use of ADR for commercial-related disputes. Mediation, practically to the exclusion of any other method of ADR, is being employed in some sectors of commercial work and survey respondents are repeat-users of the process. The majority of mediations reported concerned breach of contract and professional negligence cases. Data suggests that the specific categorisation of a commercial disputes as (say) professional <b>negligence,</b> <b>personal</b> injury or breach of contact is unlikely to affect mediation achieving full settlement. Commercial respondents were of the opinion that mediation is suitable {{for a wide variety of}} commercial case-types but breach of contract, professional negligence, general negligence and debt cases were specifically perceived to be appropriate. Commercial respondents reported that the major determinants for mediation reaching a successful outcome are the attitude and expectation of the parties in taking part in good faith and their willingness to compromise...|$|R

She died later the same day at the Royal Preston Hospital. Gill initially appeared to blame McClay for the incident. A statement issued by the Cumbria Police said that there was no suggestion of any foul play or any issue of suicide or self-harm. In 2014, during the investigation an environmental officer from Barrow Borough Council stated that a bolt on the door between the dark den and the keepers' corridor was found to be defective after the attack. A [...] "narrative verdict" [...] was delivered in 2014 at the inquest into McClay's death, stating that she had entered the enclosure but that it was not at that time possible to determine how this had happened. In June 2016, the zoo pleaded guilty to breaches of Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, for failing to maintain the bolt and for allowing the door to be unlocked. Gill was acquitted of <b>personal</b> charges of <b>negligence.</b> The Zoo was fined £450,000 for its breaches a few days later.|$|R
2500|$|Caesar {{publicly}} distanced {{himself from}} the affair {{as much as possible}} [...] and certainly from Pompeia, whom he divorced because [...] "Caesar's wife must be above suspicion". He had been correctly absent from the rites but as a paterfamilias he was responsible for their piety. As pontifex maximus, he was responsible for the ritual purity and piety of public and private religion. He had the responsibility act to ensure that the Vestals had acted correctly, then chair the inquiry into what were essentially his own household affairs. Worse, the place of the alleged offense was the state property loaned to every pontifex maximus for his tenure of office. It was a high profile, much commented case. The rites remained officially secret, but many details emerged during and after the trial, and remained permanently in the public domain. They fueled theological speculation, as in Plutarch and Macrobius: and they fed the prurient male imagination [...] given their innate moral weakness, what might women do when given wine and left to their own devices? Such anxieties were nothing new, and underpinned Rome's traditional strictures against female autonomy. In the political and social turmoil of the Late Republic, Rome's misfortunes were taken as signs of divine anger against the <b>personal</b> ambition, religious <b>negligence</b> and outright impiety of her leading politicians.|$|R
40|$|The {{shadow of}} state secrets casts itself longer than {{previously}} acknowledged. Between 2001 and 2009 the government asserted state secrets {{in more than}} 100 cases, while in scores more litigants appealed to the doctrine in anticipation of government intervention. Contractor cases ranged from breach of contract, patent disputes, and trade secrets, to fraud and employment termination. Wrongful death, <b>personal</b> injury, and <b>negligence</b> suits kept pace, extending beyond product liability to include infrastructure and services, as well as conduct of war. In excess of fifty telecommunications suits linked to the NSA warrantless wiretapping program emerged 2006 - 2009, with the government acting, variously, as plaintiff, intervenor, and defendant. In cases stemming from allegations of Fourth and Fifth Amendment violations, torture, environmental degradation, breach of espionage contracts, and defamation, the government defended both the suit and state secrets assertions. The doctrine {{also played a role}} in the criminal context. Collectively, these cases underscore the importance of looking more carefully at how the doctrine actually works. They also suggest the emergence of a new form of “greymail”: companies embedded in the state may threaten to air legally- or politically-damaging information should the government refuse to support their state secrets assertion. And they challenge the dominant paradigm, which tends to cabin state secrets as an evidentiary rule within executive privilege, suggesting in contrast that it has evolved to become a powerful litigation tool, wielded by both private and public actors...|$|R
40|$|This Essay {{addresses}} {{the transformation of}} civil law that began in this country, roughly around the mid- 1960 s, from a legal system that intervened {{in the lives of}} citizens only on occasions of serious moral dereliction, to the most extensive and powerful regulatory mechanism of modern society. Prior to the 1960 s, civil law served a modest role in U. S. affairs. It enforced property rights and policed boundary disputes through property law, enforced promises as well as disclaimers of liability through contract law, and provided damages for <b>personal</b> injury through <b>negligence</b> law (tort law) when an individual was injured by an egregious breach of standards of normal behavior. Though the negligence standard proved loose enough to allow substantial subsequent expansion, courts prior to the 1960 s employed this standard only where a party showed clear moral culpability that was substantially antagonistic to social norms. Standards determined by private contract were far more significant to the determination of the obligations of citizens. Since the 1960 s, however, our civil law has changed dramatically. Contract law, property law, and especially personal injury law have transformed both in function and effect. The transformation occurred through neither a sudden change in legal doctrine, nor legislative statute or popular referendum. Instead, the transformation occurred through the triumph of a set of ideas: the acceptance by the judiciary of the proposition that civil damages judgments can serve as the most effective public policy instrument for regulating the level of harm suffered by citizens in the society...|$|R
40|$|As a Thai feminist scholar, I {{engaged in}} a study of the {{economic}} and social circumstances of a particular group of women, poor and working class Thai sex workers, over the late 1990 s to 2001. In this thesis, Thailand and New Zealand are the primary geographical points for the commercialisation of poor and working class Thai women prostitutes. The rational is to present an explanation for why these women engaged both in the Thailand and New Zealand sex trade. In addition, my thesis investigates the causes and consequences of Thai women being traded nationally and globally, as though they were a form of merchandise. The chief assumption underlying this study is that the effects of female poverty, such as the deficiency and inadequacy of education and of work opportunities, influence the numbers of poor and working-class Thai girls and women entering the sex industry. These women are additionally constrained socially by their gender, their poverty and their class position combined. Inequality between males and females in Thai culture is the overriding factor contributing to unjust profiteering by the sex businesses that employ these women sex workers. The causes and consequences of sex work among poor and working class Thai women are investigated by interviewing thirty former and current prostitutes in Thailand and in New Zealand. The hypothesis that their plight is mainly a result of sex discrimination in Thai society is examined by using Thai feminist methodologies. The interviews show that these sex workers initially entered prostitution in order to escape from poverty, and continued to do sex work because of particular controlling factors in their lives such as the obligation to support their families/children. The interviews also implied the misleading belief of Thai women sex workers that sex work would bring them economic security. However, as the findings show, sex work does not always engender such financial security, but frequently begets painful experiences. In spite of this, most prostitutes assent to this situation and prolong their sex occupation. Later, these Thai prostitutes struggle and hope for self-sufficient improvement of their lives in first world regions and countries other than Thailand. The difficulty of avoiding sexual exploitation in Thailand pressurised them into migrating to other countries, including New Zealand. In general, the findings of my research establish that Thai women prostitutes have little control over their economic state in overseas countries. However they had less power over their lives in Thailand and elsewhere than in they had in New Zealand. In addition, gambling and alcohol seem to be used as the primary methods of comforting their <b>personal</b> stress. The <b>negligence</b> of their money discipline is also the cause of Thai sex workers intermittently re-entered prostitution. In particular, the stigma of sex work is an outstanding aspect in their later lives after giving up sex work. I conclude that sex work is a destructive work alternative for most Thai sex workers, though it obviously offers the possibility of making some money. Furthermore, I assert that their individual rights must be upheld as equivalent to those of other women, so that these sex workers are empowered in their 'life situation'...|$|R
