5|$|More recent sites {{include several}} motte-and-bailey castles such as Cary Castle, and church crosses which {{date from the}} Middle Ages. Several <b>packhorse</b> bridges, such as Bow Bridge, Plox also appear in the list. The most recent monuments include the Round House, a village lock-up in Castle Cary dating from 1779.|$|E
5|$|The {{market for}} duck meat in Aylesbury itself was small, and the ducks were {{generally}} sent to London for sale. By the 1750s Richard Pococke recorded that four cartloads of ducks were sent from Aylesbury to London every Saturday, {{and in the}} late 18th and early 19th centuries the ducks continued to be sent over the Chiltern Hills to London by <b>packhorse</b> or cart.|$|E

5|$|Inland, many of {{the attractions}} are small towns and villages or linked to the river valleys, such as the ancient clapper bridge at Tarr Steps and the Snowdrop Valley near Wheddon Cross, which is carpeted in {{snowdrops}} in February and, later, displays bluebells. Withypool {{is also in the}} Barle Valley, the Two Moors Way passes through the village. As well as Dunster Castle, Dunster's other attractions include a priory, dovecote, yarn market, inn, <b>packhorse</b> bridge, mill and a stop on the West Somerset Railway. Exford lies on the River Exe.|$|E
5|$|Leigh is crossed by the Bolton to St Helens Road high road, an old <b>packhorse</b> {{route that}} became a Turnpike Trust in 1762. The A579 road {{bypasses}} the town centre using {{the line of the}} Bolton and Leigh Railway. The Bridgewater Canal and the Leigh Branch of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal cross the town west to east, the canals meeting at Leigh Bridge just south of the town centre.|$|E
5|$|<b>Packhorse</b> routes criss-crossed the Peak in the Medieval era, {{and some}} paved causeways are {{believed}} to date from this period, such as the Long Causeway along Stanage Edge. However, no highways were marked on Christopher Saxton's map of Derbyshire, published in 1579. Bridge-building improved the transport network. A surviving early example is the three-arched gritstone bridge over the River Derwent at Baslow, which dates from 1608 and has an adjacent toll-shelter.|$|E
60|$|The {{business}} of packing, however, {{had at last}} fallen into less cruel or at least more judicial hands, and though the trail was filled with long pack trains going and coming, they were {{for the most part}} well taken care of. We met many long trains of <b>packhorses</b> returning empty from Bennett Lake. They were followed by shouting drivers who clattered along on <b>packhorses</b> wherever the trail would permit.|$|R
30|$|Gregory Blaxland (1823) led {{the first}} European {{crossing}} of the Blue Mountains in 1813. He described thickets of “brushwood” that impeded the <b>packhorses.</b> However, in unknown territory, a few men were able to clear and blaze a track through this tall shrubland for four heavily laden <b>packhorses</b> {{at the rate of}} one mile (1.6 km) per hour, suggesting that the shrubs were not very dense, and certainly not as dense as they are today.|$|R

5|$|The stone <b>packhorse</b> bridge {{crosses the}} River Avill at the {{southern}} end of the village, below Dunster Castle at a point which may have been the limit of tidal flow during the medieval period. It was important for the transport of wool and other goods to the market within the village which was established by 1222. The name is derived from the nearby gallows. The narrow bridge is approach via a raised causeway for pedestrians, while wheeled traffic uses the adjacent ford.|$|E
5|$|There {{are other}} {{mountain}} sheep on the Lakeland fells, notably Swaledales and Rough-Fells, but the hardy Herdwick is the sheep {{most likely to}} be seen in and around the Duddon valley, the Coniston fells, the Buttermere fells and, through Borrowdale or Wasdale, up to the highest land in England, the Scafells. More than the old drystone walls that quarter the fells, the <b>packhorse</b> bridges or the whitewashed farmsteads, the little grey Herdwick sheep typify the Lakeland.|$|E
5|$|After the two rivers merge, the Avon {{then turns}} south east {{away from the}} Cotswolds and then quickly south into the clay Dauntsey Vale, where it is joined by the River Marden, until it reaches the biggest town so far, Chippenham. The wide vale {{is now known as}} the Avon Vale, and the river flows on via Lacock to Melksham, then turns north-west through Bradford on Avon, where the centre of the town grew up around the ford across the river Avon, hence the origin of the town's name ("Broad-Ford"). This was {{supplemented}} in Norman times by the stone bridge that still stands today. The Norman side is upstream, and has pointed arches; the newer side has curved arches. The Town Bridge and Chapel is a grade I listed building. It was originally a <b>Packhorse</b> bridge, but widened in the 17th century by rebuilding the western side. On the bridge stands a small building which was originally a chapel but later used as a town lock-up.|$|E

5|$|The {{village of}} Luccombe {{lies at the}} foot of Dunkery Hill. Along with Stoke Pero and Horner it forms a civil parish. Horner is on the eastern bank of Horner Water on which there is a restored, but non-working, watermill. The river is crossed by two medieval <b>packhorse</b> bridges, one of which is known as Hacketty Way Bridge which is crossed by the Coleridge Way. The parish Church of St Mary has a chancel dating from about 1300, with the nave and tower being added around 1450. Stoke Pero Church has a 13th-century tower. The Dovecot at Blackford Farm is part of the estate. It was built in the 11th century and is a Grade II* listed building, and ancient monument. It was {{attached}} to a mansion house which burnt down in 1875.|$|E

The mining history of the area is also represented by several sections of the West Somerset Mineral Railway and associated ruins of mine buildings which are now scheduled. The most recent monuments are World War II pillboxes.

5000|$|As {{the nation}} {{expanded}} west, <b>packhorses,</b> singly or {{in a pack}} train of several animals, were used by early surveyors and explorers, most notably by fur trappers, [...] "Mountain men", and gold prospectors who covered great distances by themselves or in small groups. <b>Packhorses</b> were used by Native American people when traveling from place to place, and were also used by traders to carry goods to both Indian and White settlements. During a few decades of the 19th Century, enormous pack trains carried goods on the Old Spanish Trail from Santa Fe, New Mexico west to California.|$|R
50|$|<b>Packhorses</b> {{have been}} used since the {{earliest}} period of domestication of the horse. They were invaluable throughout antiquity, through the Middle Ages, and into modern times where roads are nonexistent or poorly maintained.|$|R

5|$|There are 69 {{scheduled}} monuments in South Somerset. Some of {{the oldest}} are Neolithic, Bronze Age or Iron Age including hillforts, such as Kenwalch's Castle and Bowl barrows. The Romano-British period is represented with several sites including the Low Ham Roman Villa which included an extensive mosaic floor, now {{on display in the}} Museum of Somerset. Religious sites are represented by Muchelney Abbey, which was probably founded in the 8th century, and Montacute Priory, a Cluniac priory of the Benedictine order, from the 11th. Bruton Abbey was founded by the Benedictines before becoming a house of Augustinian canons. Stoke sub Hamdon Priory was formed in 1304 as a chantry college rather than a priory. More recent sites include several motte-and-bailey castles such as Cary Castle, and church crosses which date from the Middle Ages. Several <b>packhorse</b> bridges, such as Bow Bridge, Plox also appear in the list.

5|$|Selworthy is a {{small village}} and civil parish which {{includes}} the hamlets of Bossington, Tivington, Lynch, Brandish Street and Allerford. Bossington is separated from Porlock Bay by a shingle beach, through which flows the River Horner, forming part of the Porlock Ridge and Saltmarsh Site of Special Scientific Interest. In the 1990s rising sea levels created salt marshes, and lagoons developed in the area behind the boulder bank. The village is on the South West Coast Path. Selworthy was rebuilt as a model village, to provide housing for the aged and infirm of the Holnicote estate, in 1828 by Sir Thomas Acland. Many of the other cottages, {{some of which are}} now rented out, are still thatched and are listed buildings, whose walls are painted with limewash that has been tinted creamy yellow with ochre. On the hill above the village is the whitewashed 15th-century Church of All Saints, with a 14th-century tower. One of Allerford's main attractions is the much-photographed <b>packhorse</b> bridge. Built as a crossing over the River Aller (from which the village gets its name), it is thought to be medieval in origin. The village is also home to Allerford House, childhood home of Admiral John Moresby, who explored the coastline of New Guinea and for whom Port Moresby, the capital city of Papua New Guinea, was named. Other features of the village include thatched cottages, a forge and an old-fashioned red telephone box. There is also a Reading Room, built by the Acland family to foster adult education. One of the thatched cottages operated as the local Primary School between 1821 and 1981 and is now a museum containing the West Somerset Rural Life Museum and Victorian School. The museum houses the West Somerset Photographic Archive.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a central}} {{bridleway}} running through the wood, which formerly provided a route for <b>packhorses</b> carrying goods between Piddington and Oxford, via Beacon's Bottom. A sewer now runs underground along this route, taking waste away from Beacon's Bottom.|$|R
25|$|Historically Little Langdale {{was at the}} {{intersection}} of <b>packhorse</b> routes leading to Ravenglass, Whitehaven, Keswick, Penrith & Carlisle, Ambleside, Hawkshead, and Coniston, Ulverston, Broughton-in-Furness and Barrow in Furness. Slater's Bridge which crosses the River Brathay in 3 spans supported by a large mid-stream boulder and stone causeways is a 16th-century, slate-built, former <b>packhorse</b> bridge on one of these routes. Today metalled roads from Little Langdale lead west over Wrynose Pass and Hardknott towards Eskdale, northwest by Blea Tarn to Great Langdale, northeast to Elterwater and east to the Skelwith Bridge - Coniston road.|$|E
