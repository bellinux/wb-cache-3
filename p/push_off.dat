5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades {{do not provide}} thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to <b>push</b> <b>off</b> with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps {{his head down and}} takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may {{be able to use the}} inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.|$|E
25|$|Goalkeepers {{routinely}} perform extension dives. To execute this, they <b>push</b> <b>off</b> {{the ground}} with the foot nearest to the ball, launching themselves into a horizontal position. At this point, the ball may be caught or pushed away. In the latter case, a good goalkeeper will attempt to ensure that the rebound cannot be taken by a player of the opposite team, although this is not always possible.|$|E
25|$|New {{research}} {{has revealed that}} a kangaroos tail acts as a third leg rather than just a balancing strut. Kangaroos have a unique three-stage walk where they plant their front legs and tail first, then <b>push</b> <b>off</b> their tail, followed lastly by the back legs. The propulsive force of the tail is {{equal to that of}} both the front and hind legs combined and performs as much work as what a human leg walking can at the same speed.|$|E

25|$|Modern boxers can {{sometimes}} be seen tapping their cheeks or foreheads with their fists in order to remind themselves to keep their hands up (which becomes difficult during long bouts). Boxers are taught to <b>push</b> <b>off</b> with their feet {{in order to move}} effectively. Forward motion involves lifting the lead leg and pushing with the rear leg. Rearward motion involves lifting the rear leg and pushing with the lead leg. During lateral motion the leg {{in the direction of the}} movement moves first while the opposite leg provides the force needed to move the body.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that there}} is a big {{difference}} between pool types. Indoor pools of 25 m give the advantage of being able to use the turning point to <b>push</b> <b>off</b> again using ones legs, thus giving a clear advantage over 50 m and of course open water venues. Open sea gives the really bad side effect of large waves and the tides, which will sometimes push the swimmer back to where they came from, this can be clearly seen in the differences in times between the Channel crossing and the almost double in length Maraton Acuatica Rio Coronda which she performed in two hours less.|$|E
25|$|Forwards tend to run {{straight}} and {{hard at the}} opposition, while the backs run at gaps between players or use speed and guile to run around them. In modern games of rugby some backs can {{be as big as}} forwards and attempt to break through the defensive line using brute force and many forwards possess the running skills of backs. Players run straight at the opposition with the aim of either breaking the tackle or getting forward momentum from which to set up another attack. If they are close to the try line they can drive in low to aid grounding the ball. Players can also try to break through tackles by spinning after making contact or by using the hand not carrying the ball to fend (<b>push)</b> <b>off</b> the defender.|$|E

25|$|Understanding {{the motion}} of the canter is {{important}} if a person wants to ride the horse with a balanced, secure, yet flexible seat. To the rider, the horse's back feels as if it is moving both up and down as well as somewhat back and forth, not unlike {{the motion of}} a swing. When the hind legs engage (which occurs just before beat one), the horse raises its head and neck as its hind leg steps under. As the legs <b>push</b> <b>off</b> the ground (beats 1 and 2) the head and neck of the horse drops. When the leading leg (beat 3) touches the ground, the head and neck are as low as they will be for the stride, and then they begin to come back up as the horse places its weight on its leading leg. During the suspension phase, the head and neck continue back to the highest point as the hind legs come back under the body.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Liverpool won the FA Cup {{again but}} Barnes missed the final with an Achilles tendon injury, which he later cited in his {{autobiography}} as dulling his acceleration, affecting his ability to <b>push</b> <b>off</b> from a still position, while not affecting his pace at full. He played just 12 league games in the 1991–92, scoring once, as Liverpool finished sixth in the league – their lowest finish in two decades {{and the first time}} since 1981 that they had failed to finish champions or runners-up. Barnes and several other senior players had frosty relationships with Souness during this period as the manager tried to impose new methods quickly, and many senior pros resented his hard discipline approach as well as the increased pressure in training. Barnes also once had to make a public apology to Souness after he gave an interview criticising the tactics employed by the manager before an important match. Young teammate Robbie Fowler also said {{in his autobiography}} that Souness felt at the time Barnes was past his best, but in Fowler's (and others') opinion he still had a lot to offer and was {{still one of the most}} talented players at the club.|$|E
500|$|During Bure's {{rehabilitation}} period, {{following his}} first major knee injury in 1995, Canucks' conditioning coach Peter Twist noticed that his skating style was distinct in comparison to typical North American players. He explained: [...] "Most players skate on their inside edge and <b>push</b> <b>off</b> at a 45-degree angle, but Bure starts on his outer edge and rolls over to his inside edge and pushes back straighter on his stride... he gets more power and force in his stride {{to get up to}} top speed quicker." [...] his skating was also complemented by his ability to deke out defenders and goaltenders at top speeds, making him capable of routinely starting end-to-end rushes. However, several knee injuries, and the resulting reconstructive surgeries, compromised the speed that defined Bure's game, ultimately leading to his retirement.|$|E

2500|$|The {{psychedelic}} frogfish {{moves by}} walking on its pectoral fins over the seafloor, {{and has been}} observed using its fins to <b>push</b> <b>off</b> from the sea floor {{while at the same}} time shooting water through its gills to propel itself forward via jet propulsion. [...] When doing so, the fish takes on a ball shape, and its behavior takes on that of a bouncing beach ball in the wind.

2500|$|Strom was officiating a NBA game {{during the}} mid-1970s between the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets with Dick Bavetta as his partner for that game. The game was close {{at the end}} and Earl made a last-second call against the Nets, ending the game with a win for Sixers. Suddenly Dick Bavetta ran across floor to the scorer's table, saying, [...] "No! No! I got a <b>push</b> <b>off</b> against McGinnis!" [...] Strom then {{challenged}} Bavetta, [...] "Are you overruling my call? I got pushing off right here!" [...] Bavetta insisted, which reversed Strom's call and the Nets wound up with the victory. With the game over, players were walking to their respective locker rooms when the door to the referees' locker room flew open and Dick Bavetta came staggering out. His uniform was ripped and he was wearing a big welt over his eye, running to get away from Strom. Strom stepped out into the hallway and hollered after Bavetta, [...] "You'll take another one of my fucking calls again, right, you motherfucker?" [...] Strom was later fined for the incident.|$|E
2500|$|By then it {{had become}} {{apparent}} that the main Dutch force was attacking from the east and that the bombardment on São Francisco was just a feint. The commander of the São Thiago garrison therefore sent 50 men under Captain João Soares Vivas to aid the inland defense. As soon as the Portuguese realized the Dutch intentions, the defenders gathered for the counterattack and occupied the high ground ahead of the Dutch. With the battle cry [...] "Santiago!", Lopo Sarmento de Carvalho signaled the counterattack, and the combined forces of the Portuguese defenders, Macanese citizens, Dominican friars, Jesuit priests, and black slaves alike charged the enemy, compelling the Dutchmen to flee. Captain Hans Ruffijn urged his countrymen to stand fast, but {{he was killed in}} the fighting as the Dutch retreat turned into a rout. The onset of the [...] "drunken negro slaves" [...] in particular, sparing no one as they beheaded all Dutchmen they came across in the name of John the Baptist, greatly demoralized the Hollanders. One black woman was even compared to the legendary baker-woman of Aljubarrota by a contemporary Jesuit for her incredible skill with a halberd during the battle. However, the Dutch got some reprieve in the pursuit when the slaves abandoned the chase to plunder the dead. When the fleeing Dutchmen reached the Cacilhas Beach, the two rear-guard companies who were supposed to cover the retreat panicked and fled to the boats without firing a shot. The panic among the Dutch landing party was so complete that the Dutch ships had to <b>push</b> <b>off</b> into deeper water to avoid being overturned by the fugitives, causing many of them to drown or be shot by the Portuguese in the sea. The next day, Admiral Reijersen sent ashore a flag of truce to negotiate the release of prisoners. The negotiation was in vain, and the dejected Dutch fleet soon left Macau waters to head for the Pescadores.|$|E
