During the 19th century, this room was furnished as an armoury.

5|$|Six {{external}} hardpoints {{were located}} {{along the bottom}} of the helicopter, with two under each wing and two on the fuselage under the sponsons. The two inner wing hardpoints could carry pods of three TOW anti-tank missiles. 2.75-inch (70mm) rockets in 7-rocket or 19-rocket launchers could be carried on the four wing hardpoints. The two fuselage mounts were dedicated to carrying external fuel tanks. The wing hardpoints were also <b>plumbed</b> to allow the carriage of additional fuel tanks if required.|$|E

The bell is fed via a large, multi-part umbilical that supplies breathing gas, electricity, communications and hot water. The bell also is fitted with exterior mounted breathing gas cylinders for emergency use. The divers are supplied from the bell through umbilicals.|$|E

(1856-1910, 1910-1986?), Philadelphia, PA - {{initially}} {{founded by}} Jonathan Yerkes in Frankfort, PA, the company moved to Church St. in Philadelphia around 1869. In 1887, Yerkes was bought {{out by a}} partner, Fayette <b>Plumb,</b> and a name change occurred around 1897. Yerkes & <b>Plumb</b> (Y & P) and <b>Plumb</b> products were often marketed under “Anchor Brand,” with a distinctive “anchor” imprint. From 1910 to 1960, <b>Plumb</b> products were produced in St. Louis, MO. After 1960, production may have occurred in WV, NC, and Lewistown, PA. <b>Plumb</b> {{is now part of}} Apex Tool Group.|$|R

In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by <b>plumbed</b> indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E

25|$|Through-tool coolant systems, {{also known}} as through-spindle coolant systems, are systems <b>plumbed</b> to deliver coolant through {{passages}} inside the spindle and through the tool, directly to the cutting interface. Many of these are also high-pressure coolant systems, in which the operating pressure can be hundreds to several thousand psi (1to30MPa)—pressures comparable to those used in hydraulic circuits. High-pressure through-spindle coolant systems require rotary unions that can withstand these pressures. Drill bits and endmills tailored for this use have small holes at the lips where the coolant shoots out. Various types of gun drills also use similar arrangements.|$|E
25|$|Kilmacolm {{expanded}} at {{an unprecedented}} speed {{and many of}} the large Victorian and Edwardian villas which characterise the village today were constructed, as well as such attractions as the Hydropathic Hotel and facilities such as banks and <b>plumbed</b> water. Combined with the dramatic expansion of the village and gentrification of the area, the traditional importance of agriculture to the parish economy declined significantly. Slightly further east on the railway line, William Quarrier's Orphans' Homes were opened in the 1870s and remained as a residential children's community until the late 1970s. Since then, what has become known as Quarrier's Village has become largely residential.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} water used by {{conventional}} flush toilets usually makes up {{a significant portion of}} personal daily water usage. However, modern low flush toilet designs allow the use of much less water per flush. Dual flush toilets allow the user to select between a flush for urine or feces, saving a significant {{amount of water}} over conventional units. The flush handle on these toilets is pushed up for one kind of flush and down for the other. In some places, users are encouraged not to flush after urination. Flush toilets can be <b>plumbed</b> to use greywater (previously used for washing dishes, laundry and bathing) rather than potable water (drinking water). Some modern toilets pressurize the water in the tank, which initiates flushing action with less water usage.|$|E

The city collects refuse. The Tribe operates a recycling program which is currently on hold. A landfill, incinerator, sludge and oil disposal site have recently been completed. A new $3 million power plant came online in 2000. A small wind turbine provides power and hot water to the village office, but it is not connected to the power grid. The village corporation has three turbines. Wind turbines were due to be installed summer/fall 2007. Electricity is provided by St. Paul Municipal Electric Utility.|$|E

All four of the under-wing hardpoints are <b>plumbed</b> for drop tanks to extend the aircraft's range, Italian aircraft are also fitted with a fixed aerial refueling probe. Optical reconnaissance pods can be carried externally on the centerline hardpoint. Wingtip rails are provided for infrared guided air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder and MAA-1 Piranha. Italian aircraft are fitted with a M61 Vulcan 20mm rotary cannon {{on the port side}} of the lower fuselage. The United States denied the sale of the M61 to Brazil, thus its AMXs are instead fitted with two 30mm DEFA 554 revolver cannons.|$|E

25|$|On 25 February, Arsenal {{played in}} {{the next round of}} the Champions League, after {{proceeding}} from the group stage as the runners-up. They {{played in the}} first leg at home against French club Monaco. Arsenal were handed a favourable draw when they were tied against the Ligue 1 side during the draw for this round and were highly expected to comfortably make it through the quarter-finals, considering that Monaco were perceived as an easy team to beat. However, an Arsenal performance that <b>plumbed</b> the depths of naivety and incompetence made them suffer a shock 3–1 defeat to the unsung French opposition. Geoffrey Kondogbia gave Monaco the lead when his long-range shot was deflected off Per Mertesacker. Then former Tottenham and Manchester United striker Dimitar Berbatov doubled Monaco's lead after a simple counterattack. An injury time goal from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gave Arsenal hope but it proved to matter not when Monaco scored again as Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco scored in the final minute of injury time after another counterattack. This shock defeat would send Arsenal on the brink of Champions League elimination in this round once more.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the [...] "schoolroom", which was larger than the Town Public Hall, the building consisted of a dining hall (cum gymnasium), the masters common room {{to the east and}} a block of six classrooms to the west. The headmaster's house was completed {{at the same time as}} the main school building, and had five bedrooms wired with electric bells, and a bathroom <b>plumbed</b> with hot and cold water. In November 1920, an organ was built at a cost of over £1,000, and placed in the schoolroom as a memorial to the old boys and masters who died in the First World War. A new gymnasium was constructed after a 1956 survey deemed its predecessor economically irreparable. Accompanied by the construction of three hard tennis courts, it was opened by Sir Benjamin Brodie in 1958, but lacked adjoining changing rooms, washing facilities and office facilities for members of the physical education staff.|$|E
