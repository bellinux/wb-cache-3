5|$|The {{fruit of}} {{blackcurrants}} can be eaten raw, {{but it has}} a strong, tart flavour.

5|$|Mycena galopus is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and plays}} an important role in forest ecosystems as a decomposer of leaf litter. It has been estimated in the UK to account for a large portion of the decomposition of the autumn leaf litter in British woodlands. It is able to break down the lignin and cellulose components of leaf litter. Grown in axenic culture in the laboratory, the fungus mycelium has been shown to degrade (in addition to lignin and cellulose) hemicelluloses, protein, soluble carbohydrates, and purified xylan and <b>pectin</b> using enzymes such as polyphenol oxidases, cellulases, and catalase. It is particularly adept at breaking down lignin, which is the second most abundant renewable organic compound in the biosphere, after cellulose. Research also suggests that the fungus weathers soil minerals, making them more available to mycorrhizal plants. Phosphorus, an important macronutrient influencing plant growth, typically occurs in primary minerals like apatite, or other organic complexes, and its low solubility often results in low phosphorus availability in soil. The biological activity of M.galopus mycelium can increase the availability of phosphorus and other nutrients, both as a result of soil acidification due to cation uptake and via the release of weathering agents such low molecular mass organic acids. Studies have shown that the fungus is sensitive to low concentrations of sulphite (SO32−), a byproduct of sulphur dioxide pollution, suggesting that this pollution can be toxic to the growth of the fungus (and the subsequent decomposition of leaf litter) at environmentally relevant concentrations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Pectins</b> are {{diverse and}} very complex biomolecules and their {{structure}} {{depends on the}} plant species and tissue. It was previously shown that derivatives of pectic polymers and oligosaccharides from <b>pectins</b> have positive effects on human health. To obtain specific pectic oligosaccharides, highly defined enzymatic mixes are required. Filamentous fungi are specialized in plant cell wall degradation and some produce {{a broad range of}} pectinases. They may therefore shed light on the enzyme mixes needed for partial hydrolysis. Results The growth profiles of 12 fungi on four <b>pectins</b> and four structural elements of <b>pectins</b> show that the presence/absence of pectinolytic genes in the fungal genome clearly correlates with their ability to degrade <b>pectins.</b> However, this correlation is less clear when we zoom in to the pectic structural elements.

The dietary fibre in fruits of 12 genotypes of Japanese quince (Chaenomeles japonica) and 1 genotype of flowering quince (C. speciosa) was prepared using two different methods: the Alcohol Insoluble Solid (AIS) method; and the AOAC method for total {{as well as}} for soluble and insoluble fibre. The two methods resulted in significantly different estimates, however, no interaction was found between the methods and the genotypes studied. For content of total dietary fibre, three main groups were distinguished, one containing a low amount of fibre (3 genotypes, 28 – 30 g/ 100 g dry matter); one containing a moderate amount of fibre (9 genotypes, 30 – 36 g/ 100 g dry matter) and an isolated genotype (C. speciosa) that contained a high amount of fibre (38 g/ 100 g dry matter). The amount and the nature of monomeric sugars in the constituent polysaccharides of the fibre were determined after total hydrolysis of the AIS and the TDF (Total Dietary Fibre). The fibre contained mostly pectic and cellulosic polysaccharides. A sequential extraction scheme allowed the separation of the cell-wall material into its major components (cellulose, <b>pectins</b> and hemicelluloses). The AIS was composed of 30 g <b>pectins,</b> 8 g hemicelluloses and 60 g cellulosic residue/ 100 g AIS. In 100 g entire dry fruit (800 g entire fresh fruit) there were 11 g <b>pectins,</b> 3 g hemicelluloses and 18 g cellulosic residue. <b>Pectins</b> were mostly located in the flesh of the fruit. <b>Pectins</b> were more efficiently extracted with hot dilute acid than with other extraction media. <b>Pectins</b> had a high degree of methylation (DM) and a low degree of acetylation (DAc). No difference was found in the quantity of polysaccharides extracted from two Japanese quince genotypes, or in the composition of these constituent polysaccharides. The physico-chemical properties of <b>pectins</b> extracted from two genotypes of Japanese quince were studied. On average, the fruits contained 11 g pectins/ 100 g dry fruit corresponding to 1. 4 g pectins/ 100 g fresh fruit. <b>Pectins</b> were sequentially extracted, and the cells from the flesh of the fruits were observed with a confocal laser scan microscope.

40|$|Summary. Recently, we have {{reported}} that cell wall <b>pectins</b> are internal-ized into apical meristem root cells. In cells exposed to the fungal metabo-lite brefeldin A, all secretory pathways were inhibited, while endocytic pathways remained intact, resulting in accumulation of internalized cell wall <b>pectins</b> within brefeldin A-induced compartments. Here we report that, {{in addition to the}} already published cell wall epitopes, rhamnogalacturonan I and xyloglucans also undergo large-scale internalization into dividing root cells. Interestingly, multilamellar endosomes were identified as compart-ments internalizing arabinan cell wall <b>pectins</b> reactive to the 6 D 7 antibody, while large vacuole-like endosomes internalized homogalacturonans reac-tive to the 2 F 4 antibody. As all endosomes belong topographically to the exocellular space, cell wall <b>pectins</b> deposited in these “cell wall islands”, enclosed by the plasma-membrane-derived membrane, are ideally suited to act as temporary stores for rapid formation of cell wall and generation of new plasma membrane.
