2500|$|Another {{risk factor}} is that of [...] "canopy {{collisions}}", or collisions between two or more skydivers under fully inflated <b>parachutes.</b> <b>Canopy</b> collisions can cause the jumpers' inflated parachutes to entangle with each other, often resulting in a sudden collapse (deflation) {{of one or more}} of the involved parachutes. When this occurs, the jumpers often must quickly perform emergency procedures (if there is sufficient altitude to do so) to [...] "cut-away" [...] (jettison) from their main canopies and deploy their reserve canopies. Canopy collisions are particularly dangerous when occurring at altitudes too low to allow the jumpers adequate time to safely jettison their main parachutes and fully deploy their reserve parachutes.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the present investigation are to determine {{the nature of the}} flow field around bluff <b>parachute</b> <b>canopies,</b> considering the effects of canopy shape parameters on this flow field and hence on the resulting aerodynamic forces and moments which are developed on the canopy surface. In order to relate the flow field developed around bluff <b>parachute</b> <b>canopies</b> to their aerodynamic characteristics, a series of experiments in the Leicester University wind tunnel has been conducted on a family of particularly significant canopy shapes. These cross-shaped canopies have excellent drag and stability characteristics if arm ratios of about 4 : 1 are selected. Flow visualisation, using both helium bubbles and wool tufts, was used to determine the flow field around the canopy. The most probable description of the wake flow is chains of irregularly-shaped vortex loops which move at about 0. 7 times the undisturbed free stream velocity. Aerodynamic forces and moments measured on the various canopies correspond with the observed flow characteristics. Statistical correlation analyses made with hot wire anemometers in their wake indicate the periodic structure of the wakes formed behind these bluff bodies and reveal their basic similarities. Strouhal numbers of about 0. 15 were obtained in the wake formed behind an imporous rigid hemispherical canopy. These are increased as canopy porosity is made larger. A useful comparison between a semi-theoretical blockage correction applied to aerodynamic forces and test results was obtained from an ancillary test programme conducted under water in a large cross-sectional area ship tank...|$|R

5000|$|The song is also {{a cautionary}} tale {{on the dangers of}} {{improper}} preparation of a parachute jump.

50|$|A body bag, {{also known}} as a cadaver pouch or human remains pouch (HRP), is a non-porous bag {{designed}} to contain a human body, used for the storage and transportation of corpses. Body bags can also be used for the storage of corpses within morgues. Before purpose-made body bags were available, cotton mattress covers were sometimes used, particularly in combat zones during the Second World War. If not available, other materials were used such as bed sheets, blankets, shelter halves, ponchos, sleeping bag covers, tablecloths, curtains, <b>parachute</b> <b>canopies,</b> tarpaulins, or discarded canvas—“sealed in a blanket”—slang. However, the subsequent rubber (and now plastic) body bag designs are much superior, not least because they prevent leakage of body fluids, which often occurs after someone dies. The dimensions of a body bag are generally around 36 inches by 90 inches (91 cm by 229 cm). Most have some form of carrying handles, usually webbing, at each corner and along the edges.|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{changing}} {{the ratio of the}} arm length and width, the arm ratio, on the static and dynamic characteristics of cruciform <b>parachute</b> <b>canopies</b> are described. Forces and moments were determined from measurements made when fabric canopies were towed under water in a ship tank as well as from integrated pressure distributions determined by using specially designed pressure transducers fixed in fabric wind tunnel models. These techniques, designed to aid in the examination of general principles concerning the dynamics of bluff bodies in viscous flow, were used to investigate time and acceleration dependent variations in aerodynamic characteristics. Flow visualization techniques were utilised to determine the flow field around cruciform canopies. From numerical analysis of fluctuating aerodynamic forces and the determination of the characteristics of the cruciform canopy flow field, it is shown that strong jets of fluid through the four gaps between adjacent canopy arms cause a gross momentum defect in the canopy wake resulting in a high degree of aerodynamic drag. From consideration of solutions of the equations of motion of a parachute system, the value of the first angle-of-attack derivative of the normal force component function is most significant in determining a given system's dynamic characteristics. Experimental results were input into the current Leicester University parachute performance computer model and the variations of dynamic performance characteristics determined as a function of arm ratio. It is shown that a unique optimum arm ratio, corresponding to the most acceptable compromise between aerodynamic drag and dynamic characteristics does not exist for all canopy-payload configurations but will always be greater than 3 : 1 for any specific configuration...|$|R

50|$|Reserve parachutes {{usually have}} a ripcord {{deployment}} system, which was first designed by Theodore Moscicki, but most modern main parachutes used by sports parachutists use a form of hand-deployed pilot chute. A ripcord system pulls a closing pin (sometimes multiple pins), which releases a spring-loaded pilot chute, and opens the container; the pilot chute is then propelled into the air stream by its spring, then uses the force generated by passing air to extract a deployment bag containing the <b>parachute</b> <b>canopy,</b> {{to which it is}} attached via a bridle. A hand-deployed pilot chute, once thrown into the air stream, pulls a closing pin on the pilot chute bridle to open the container, then the same force extracts the deployment bag. There are variations on hand-deployed pilot chutes, but the system described is the more common throw-out system.|$|E

40|$|The Holloman High Speed Test Track (HHSTT) is an {{aerospace}} {{ground test}} facility. Commonly {{referred to as}} the Track, the HHSTT is the world’s premier rocket sled test facility. The HHSTT provides a critical mission in support of the nation’s warfighter. Over the years, the HHSTT has demonstrated a wide variety of test capabilities. New applications for rocket sled testing are frequently developed. Among its proven test capabilities are full-scale life support systems, <b>parachutes,</b> <b>canopies,</b> impact testing, weapons dispense testing, and environmental testing. The HHSTT has the capability to generate a rainfield of varying intensities and droplet sizes. However, the effect of the local wind conditions has never been studied or analyzed. This wind effect on the rainfield is the primary objective of this paper. In order to execute this wind/rainfield study the HHSTT has acquired one laser precipitation monitor (LPM), ten ultrasonic anemometers, and a wind barrier. The test setup consisted of a wind-barrier (100 m long and 5 m high) set 18 m to the West of the track. The wind barrier consisted of a metal structure supporting a polyester screen which had a 30 % porosity rating. Wind data were collected continuously over a four-day period using ten ultrasonic anemometers arranged in an array across the middle of the wind barrier, with a 20 Hz sampling frequency. In order to analyze the effectiveness of the wind barrier, the anemometers were placed in front of and behind the wind barrier.

40|$|Although many {{sophisticated}} stability {{models of}} parachutes have appeared, advances {{are concentrated in}} the simulation of dynamics of the solid body components of multibody systems. For the complex canopy aerodynamics it is routine to quote several standard simplifying assumptions, few {{of which can be}} factually justified since none of the models has convincingly demonstrated its validity by detailed comparison with experimental data. Such demonstrations are essential for confident prediction. This study investigates a fundamental three-dimensional parachute model. Fluid accelerative reactions are represented by an idealised added mass tensor, and it is shown that the equations of motion in previous treatments are either inadequately or incorrectly derived and/or implemented. Nonlinear solutions of the six degree-of-freedom equations for a rigid axisymmetric system are obtained, and a parameter sensitivity analysis for dynamic stability of a typical personnel parachute indicates that the most important aerodynamic parameters are the added mass components and the pitch damping derivative, not one of which has been adequately estimated. A systematic validation method is outlined. The kinematics of four free-falling parachute scale models, with canopy flight diameters from 1. 4 m to 5. 8 m, have been acquired from a strapdown inertial measurement system. Spectral analysis of the transducer signals reveals sharply defined frequencies of oscillation. Comparisons of simulation and experiment demonstrate that satisfactory agreement in frequencies and mean amplitudes of oscillation can be extracted. However, no inherent influence is evident in the model to enable the observed, apparently random amplitude modulation to be reproduced. Sources of the random motion are discussed, one significant and hitherto ignored source being self-excited unsteadiness of the separated flow around the canopy. Measurements of unsteady aerodynamic forces on <b>parachute</b> <b>canopies</b> are needed, also improved estimates of fluid accelerative reactions and aerodynamic damping...|$|R
