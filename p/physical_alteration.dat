When reactivated in 1967 New Jersey had her 20mm Oerlikon and 40mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns removed, and received improved electronic warfare capabilities. This alteration helped reduce the time it took get New Jersey recommissioned: since she was not in her World War II format the only major <b>physical</b> <b>alteration</b> to New Jersey involved the removal of four of her ten 5inch gun mounts {{to make room for the}} Armored Box Launchers. In addition to saving time, this also made New Jersey cheaper to reactivate since the cost needed to modernize the battleship only included the addition of missile and gun system mounts, electronic warfare suites, and improved radar and gun spotter technology.|$|E

50|$|The river {{engineering}} discipline now {{strives to}} repair hydromodified degradations and account for potential systematic response to planned alterations by considering fluvial geomorphology. Fluvial geomorphology {{is the study}} of how rivers change their form over time. Fluvial geomorphology is the cumulation of a number of sciences including open channel hydraulics, sediment transport, hydrology, physical geology, and riparian ecology. River engineering attempts to understand fluvial geomorphology, implement a <b>physical</b> <b>alteration,</b> and maintain public safety.|$|E
5000|$|Few {{changes have}} been made to the subway, {{substation}} and yard since closure, as the site of the former railway has long escaped the attention of city officials. In the 1960s, the city briefly attempted {{to make use of the}} subway for the storage of impounded automobiles, and later as a makeshift disaster shelter. [...] The only <b>physical</b> <b>alteration</b> to the site came about in 1967, when a portion between Flower and Figueroa Streets in downtown was filled in to accommodate the foundation of the Bonaventure Hotel.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the past}} 90 years the Baree School of Arts {{has been used}} for various {{community}} leisure activities and receptions including dances, movies, weddings, parties and local resident meetings. The multitude of uses has resulted in some <b>physical</b> <b>alteration</b> to the building fabric, most notably the adaptation of the library/reading room to accommodate a toilet facility. However, despite these changes the original configuration of the building remains largely intact. The Baree School of Arts is a highly valued community resource and an important remnant of a town ship which once serviced one of the biggest gold mines in the world.|$|E
5000|$|Concurrent {{with the}} move to restore former {{industrial}} mills into residences, has been the conversion of certain sites into a mix of retail shops, offices and restaurants and other non-industrial uses. During the 1980s, many of the historic cotton mills in Fall River, Massachusetts were converted into factory outlet stores, although with minimal <b>physical</b> <b>alteration</b> other than some partitions and carpeting. The factory outlet stores in Fall River were highly successful for many years, but have in recent years declined, a victim of newer [...] "premium outlet" [...] malls opening up in nearby suburban areas such as Wrentham, Massachusetts, and others.|$|E

50|$|Critics {{contend that}} MTR is a {{destructive}} and unsustainable practice that benefits {{a small number}} of corporations at the expense of local communities and the environment. Though the main issue has been over the <b>physical</b> <b>alteration</b> of the landscape, opponents to the practice have also criticized MTR for the damage done to the environment by massive transport trucks, and the environmental damage done by the burning of coal for power. Blasting at MTR sites also expels dust and fly-rock into the air, which can disturb or settle onto private property nearby. This dust may contain sulfur compounds, which corrodes structures and is a health hazard.|$|E
50|$|A stored-value phonecard {{contains}} the balance {{available on the}} card. This balance can be read by a public payphone machine when the card is inserted into the payphone's card reader. This is superficially similar to a bank automated teller machine, but a stored-value card is more closely analogous to a change purse. While ATMs (as well as the remote memory systems discussed below) use the card merely to identify the associated account and record changes in a central database, stored-value systems make a <b>physical</b> <b>alteration</b> to the card to reflect the new balance after a call. Used primarily for payphones, stored-value systems avoid the time lag and expense of communication with a central database, {{which would have been}} prohibitive before the 1990s. There are several ways in which the value can be encoded on the card.|$|E

5000|$|Astronomer Jack Robinson {{from the}} University of South Florida has further {{proposed}} that cairn pair FD {{was used to}} observe the rising of the star Fomalhaut, which would have lined up with its rising point between AD 1050 and AD 1450, when Fomalhaut had its first heliacal rise roughly {{a month before the}} summer solstice. A carbon date for the Bighorn Medicine Wheel comes from a piece of wood found in cairn F, corresponding to an age of no more than 220 years, roughly {{in the middle of the}} 18th century. However, this date can only be considered as a minimum age, as the wood may have become lodged in the cairn after construction. Stated by Don Grey in his, “Summary Report,” page 317 of the 1958 Wyoming Archaeology Society's excavation of the Wheel, “In the large cairn on the northwest side of the structure was found a piece of wood pinned down between the courses of stone in the wall. A sample was taken…for dating.” Upon this carbon dating of a [...] "wall" [...] of the Wheel that could have been built and rebuilt many times, but this non-valid date for the Wheel has been repeated ever since. The astronomical dating doieby Robinson, giving a date of AD 1100 stands as the most credible scientific date for the last <b>physical</b> <b>alteration</b> of cairns for astronomy purposes. This is not an origin date for the Wheel but a [...] "last altered" [...] date.|$|E
