25|$|Both EMG and NCS {{involve some}} measure of discomfort. EMG {{involves}} the use of a tiny needle that is inserted into specific muscles to test the associated muscle and nerve function. Both EMG & NCS involve very mild shocks that in normal patients are comparable to a rubber band snapping on the skin. Although these tests can be very useful in CRPS, thorough informed consent needs to be obtained prior to the procedure, particularly in patients experiencing severe allodynia. In spite of the utility of the test, these patients may wish to decline the <b>procedure</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to avoid discomfort.|$|E

This often includes discussion over timetables and may include concessions to demands by opposition parties to ensure quick passage of a bill or opposition support.

2500|$|Some {{hospitals}} and clinics have begun to utilize a technique used in colon hydrotherapy {{as an alternative to}} the standard preparation methods described above. [...] In this case, special equipment is used to gently flush the patient's colon with warm water, just prior to the colonoscopy <b>procedure,</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to remove any bowel contents. [...] This alleviates the patient from having to ingest large quantities of fluids, or risk nausea, vomiting, or anal irritation. [...] The time required for preparation overall is significantly reduced, which often facilitates easier scheduling of the procedure.|$|E
2500|$|According to Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett in {{a recent}} Wall Street Journal article, [...] "cases {{involving}} spoilation of evidence rarely go to trial because the odds are so skewed against the offending party." [...] In this case, the judge told the jury that EchoStar failed to preserve certain evidence; he barred Dish from calling its expert witness to testify on damages. Additionally, the court stated in its November 3, 2010 ruling: “In conclusion, the court notes EchoStar’s pattern of egregious conduct and questionable – and, at times, blatantly improper – litigation tactics. EchoStar’s spoliation in this action, {{and the fact that}} it has been sanctioned for spoliation in previous actions, is precisely the type of offensive conduct that cannot be tolerated by the court. Similarly egregious is EchoStar’s last minute finagling with expert reports, believing that it can play fast and loose with the rules of <b>procedure</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to enhance its litigation posture.” ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{is common}} for a general feeling of {{discomfort}} to accompany the electrical stimulation of the nerve, but nearly all patients prefer to undergo the <b>procedure</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to effect a treatment for their condition. [...] Measurements are generally taken on the normal, unaffected side of the face first, {{and then on the}} abnormal side. [...] Bipolar stimulation is generated at the stylomastoid foramen, while the recording electrodes are attached at the terminal ends of the nerve near the nose. [...] A ground electrode is placed {{in the center of the}} patient’s forehead, sufficiently far from the facial nerve as to not give an output reading. [...] A variety of stimulation locations may also be employed, to get the best possible results. [...] Audiologists aim to get the most efficient readings possible by optimizing results with a minimal input stimulus. [...] The amount of damage is calculated as a ratio of how much nerve conduction has been retained by the affected side compared to the healthy value. [...] Massive amounts of clinical experience may be required to accurately interpret the data received from testing, and misreading the results may put the patient at serious risk of developing further damage or creating a problem in otherwise healthy facial nerves.|$|E
